Before I had even met Ellen I made a promise with my dad to take Mila in if he couldn't care for her, which is something I discussed with Ellen before she even moved in, and she had no complaints then.\n\n\nMy dad fell ill four months ago, and of course I took Mila in. He is not getting better, so he asked me to officially adopt her and I agreed. Ellen was furious that I made this decision without consulting her, despite me having told her about the arrangement in the past. Although I feed, walk, groom and manage all of Mila's needs, financially and otherwise, Ellen said she had to 'put her foot down' on this issue.\n\n\nI asked Ellen if there were any specific\u00a0 reasons she was so opposed us keeping Mila, and she stated the following:\n\n- She said that since she works from home full time (whereas I'm closer to 50/50) that I can't understand how much having a dog around affects her work (she makes clay art, crockery, that sort of thing)\n- Having a dog is expensive, and it will be a drain on our finances (which are not joined, I'll note, and I've paid for everything so far)\n- It will make it more difficult for us if we ever want to have a child\n- Our house is not huge, so it doesn't make sense to have a big dog like Mila\n- She has friends who have severe dog hair allergies, and she doesn't want them to feel they can't visit anymore\n\n\n[None of her complaints had anything to do with any bad behavior. Mila does not jump on people or furniture, bite, bark at visitors, she will follow commands to leave a room if they're given to her etc.]\n\n\nI see that these are reasonable objections to not taking Mila in but I stayed firm in my position. Ellen said that if I loved her, I would make other arrangements, and at this stage I was getting a bit angry so what I said next may have been a little harsh. I told her \"Love has nothing to do with this. My first responsibilities are my dad and Mila, and nothing you say will convince me to send her away. If you seriously can't cope with that, you can get out of my home.\"\n\n\nEllen burst into tears at this and left to go stay with her mom, citing that I clearly need time to 'think this over'. A bunch of her friends who know me have been telling me that I'm a total AH for prioritizing a dog over my girlfriend of nearly three years, but my own friends have been telling me to stand my ground. Ellen has been radio silent, has not come home and is not responding to my texts. So I guess I'm looking for some unbiased opinions on the matter.

She knew in advance, but was just hoping it would never happen. The world needs more people like you who place value on keeping your word and knowing the value of an animal. \nKeep the dog. If you give in now, you'll always be giving in to her and you'll always regret not keeping the dog. \nA dog is probably the only thing on earth, beside your parents, who will love you unconditionally.", "NTA. This is not a new issue. All successful relationships/marriages are based on compromise. You communicated this to her before and she understood. This isn't some random dog. At this point with your father falling ill, it could actually be a therapy dog too, when you visit him. Knowing that his dog is being taken care of by his son surely feeds his spirit during this difficult time and for your gf to use this as a \"If you love me\" moment and make you choose? She lost and she should have. And she'll use this line in the future too, which is extremely manipulative. I've been with my husband for close to 24 years and neither one of us has ever said that. If you break now with that line, be ready for her to use it over and over, just to get her way.", "NTA. You clearly communicated the plan prior to her ever moving in. On top of that, does she consider the REASON you\u2019re taking in the dog, the illness of your father. It\u2019s pretty inconsiderate for her to make this situation about her when you\u2019re doing a solid for your sick dad.\n\nIf you already had a dog before she moved in, would she not have moved in? Would she have told you to give up your dog? I don\u2019t think so!", "Nta! And you said she knew about this arrangement with your dad. While I only understand one of her reasons and that\u2019s her work, the rest the dog wouldn\u2019t affect as long as it\u2019s properly trained.

Like, she can do her work in a room Mila doesn\u2019t have access to. \n\nShe gave you an ultimatum that was not fair. You were honoring a promise that you had before you met Ellen and she was aware of and agreed to the promise. Now she\u2019s complaining.

Regardless of who the AH is you\u2019re going to want to sort this out with Ellen or prepare to lose your gf over this arrangement. You basically told her straight up my dad and my dog mean more to me than you do. That\u2019s probably why she is so upset.

She gave you her approval to have the dog just to turn around and throw a tantrum  when you followed through. Her statement saying that if you loved her, you\u2019d get rid of the dog is SO manipulative and wrong.", "NTA - one thing to consider is that dogs are very emotional and Mila is likely very sad to be missing your dad. Throwing her into a stranger's home would further traumatize her and could lead to depression. Dogs are also tough and she'd likely bounce back, but rescue dogs usually go through a lot. The fact your gf doesn't even consider this is telling. I don't know her, but I would hesitate to raise a child with someone so cold hearted.", "NTA -  You made a promise and you talked to her about it.  It wasn't an issue because she never thougt it would happen.\n\n\"If you love me blah blah blah\" - That is emoional  manipulation.  That one comment alone would make me tell her to take a hike.  People that use that are manipulative - dump her, keep the dog.  With this comment she is showing her true colors.", "A dog is expensive and will drain your expenses but a child won't? Keep the dog ditch the manipulator", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds like she never wanted the dog around to begin with, but just agreed with whatever you said in order to move in. She probably thought that once she was living in your home, you\u2019d become so enthralled by her that you\u2019d do whatever she said. Boy, was she in for a surprise. \n\nHer reasons are flailing, and show that she\u2019s just trying to spew out whatever she can think of, and hoping something will stick. When that didn\u2019t work, she resorted to the, \u201cIf YoU lOvE mE\u2026\u201d garbage. \n\nYou have one father. Girlfriends will come and go. \n\nWhy would you want to have a child with someone who doesn\u2019t like dogs, anyway?", "NTA. You pay for the dog and the dog is well behaved. If your girlfriend had an allergic reaction, it would've been different. I'd say the dog stays, if I were you I would do the same.", "NTA\n\nThe dog is family.  She deserves to be treated like a princess. Either ditch the GF or have a proper sit down discussion where you state you are not going to give up the dog but is there anything that could make life easier for her - the GF that is.", "NTA from your description of the situation.  This agreement predated your relationship, you pay for everything, etc.  The only leg she has to stand on is potentially the dog hair/allergy issue, but again, she agreed to it beforehand.  Guess she found out her ultimatum didn't work.", "NTA, in my experience dogs often help to bring out the true nature of people.\n\nAllergic here btw, I love visiting people with dogs though because I can just pop a pill and enjoy giving scratches and cuddles for a few hours, sorry to all my friends for being too focused on the four leged friendo sometimes...", "NTA\n\nIf she loved you, she would understand that you are giving your sick father peace of mind by providing a home to his beloved pet when he is not well enough to take care of her himself something she knew may happen prior to you living together.\n\nIf she loved you, she would respect you keeping your promises to someone you love as it shows that you only make promises you can keep.\n\nWhy is it more important that her friends can visit over you keeping your promise to your dad?\n\nIs your home the only place she can see her friends with allergies, or can alternative arrangements be made so she can spend time with them?", "NTA your gf is a spoiled brat.", "NTA \nMila was a part of your life and you made commitments to her and your dad before your gf was even a possibility. You were open about this commitment from the beginning, if your gf had ANY issues with the possibility of living with a dog then she should have said something then. \nHer \u201creasons\u201d may seem valid at first glance, but they are more like excuses and grasping at straws. The only one that I MIGHT consider valid is the friends with allergies, but I still say those friends can either take an allergy pill once in a while depending on the severity of the allergy, or oh well they just don\u2019t come over and gf can visit them elsewhere.

What you should have done is discuss logistics with Ella before you moved Mila in, a random conversation a few years ago does not equate agreement to live with a dog full time. There are things that should have been agreed on, like how is her work space going to be impacted and measures put in place to mitigate that, who's looking after Mila when you're not at home, who's going to pay for large vet bills, boarding fees if you go on holiday etc. \n\nIt's not that these are insurmountable problems, it's that you showed a complete disregard for her right to have input as the other half of the couple living in this home. You're treating her as if she's a guest who's staying there for a night. In fact, you'd probably treat them better than this as you'd ask if they have allergies or issues with dogs.\n\nIt might be your house, but this is also her home.

My dad is young enough, he set precautions but never did I actually expect things would come to what they are now.

I am not giving away the dog he loves. \n\nLastly, I think it's incredibly unfair of you to insinuate I'm some woman-hating misogynist for being angry and saying things I openly regret to my girlfriend in an argument where she presented me with an ultimatum.

If that's not something she can cope with, that's unfortunate but I don't know if I can break my word", "Respectfully disagree. Dad and son could perfectly have had a conversation about \"what if something happens to me\". Not everybody dies in old age. There's disease, disability, a million things that not necessarily are dependent on age and age only. Yes, one would expect that if nothing bad happens, the average person will reach 80yo or whatever and the dog would be long dead by then. But the thing is that life is unpredictable. \n\nAnd according to her objections...I don't see them that reasonable considering their circumstances. \n\n-If the finances are not combined yet, the dog isn't putting a dent on her bank account so as long as OP is okay paying, she has no right to complain about that. The promise preceded the girlfriend so in this case, that comment makes her sound entitled to me.  \n\n-Having a dog makes having children harder. Yes, that's why there are only dogs in childfree houses. \n\n-She needs her space to work. Okay, perfectly fair, close the door. Like you would to if it was kids and you're a parent working from home. \n\n-Her friends can't visit because they are allergic. --- What a shame! Let's get rid of a dog who already came from a rescue, who right now is separated from her original owner but at least with his son, and send her back to the shelter or give her to strangers just so some people can come home and have coffee once a week if not less.

But I still would have said to my husband \"ok, this is the situation, we have to take the dog in.

You keeping a promise to your dad doesn't mean having to treat your gf like a piece of furniture. \n\nAnd yes, if you don't treat your gf like an equal partner then you need to look into why you're doing that.\n\nEdited to add: she presented you with an ultimatum but isn't this exactly what you did to her? Mila is coming, I've decided how it's going to be, you like it or lump it.

She doesn't get to get angry that you are doing the thing you specifically told her you were going to do. You went above and beyond to acknowledge and discuss her concerns, even if you did ultimately veto them. It shows that you've thought through the ramifications of having a dog. The one thing I can understand is that a large dog in a small space will be disruptive to pottery, especially if she doesn't have a separate work area. So she needs to set up a work area away from the dog, or if that's not possible, crate the dog or put her in another room for a few hours. Mila will be fine.\n\nI don't do these kind of ultimatums. I would choose the dog too, but not because I love her more than my partner. One, you made a commitment to your father and are honoring it. Two, she was informed prior to moving in and made no objections, three any kind of ultimatum like this feels inherently manipulative and I am inclined to cut my losses and run. If she's willing to \"put her foot down\" over this issue, which she agreed to in the first place, when else is she going to put her foot down? \"If you love me you'll...\" is a statement almost guaranteed to get me to cut someone out of my life. How about if you love me you'll stop trying to force me to do what you want me to do?\n\nGetting a big dog is a big responsibility, so I do hope you are being forthcoming when you say you are responsible for all of her needs. Just know that if Ellen comes home, she will be 0% responsible for taking care of Mila. Maybe make it clear that you expect her to do the bare minumum like give Mila food or water and let her out to pee if you're going to be gone for a long time. But all of her care and costs are on you. This is your dog.", "Firstly, I'm sorry about your dad OP; I sincerely hope he manages to get better. You're NTA and if I were you I'd definitely be single after that ultimatum. Not only had Mila been living with you guys for months you're keeping her as part as a promise to your SICK FATHER. As you said Mila's not a poorly behaved dog and she knows to leave the room when told, Ellen's not paying for any of her expenses, and for the past few months the size of the house hadn't been an issue so far. If the dog hair was a problem for her friends with dog allergies what have they been doing before that couldn't be continued long term.\n\nAt my old job at my local SPCA we tried out best to keep the dogs happy and healthy but we were too understaffed to properly tend to enrichment needs and the shelter environment just naturally stressed the animals out sometimes. I could never imagine giving up a pet, regardless of how I came to own it, just because my partner suddenly had a problem keeping them at our home.\n\nEllen saying you didn't love her if you kept Mila is a clear cut example of her trying to manipulate you and I'm glad you didn't fall for it. Yes what you said might've been harsh and it's good that you recognize that but I can't blame you, your father's sick and having her try to pull that shit was only going to make the overall stress of the situation worse. I hope things work out for you two but she needs to understand that you have a promise and responsibility with your dad and with Mila; a dog wasn't a responsibility that cropped up out of nowhere and Ellen still moved in knowing that your place becoming Mila's new forever home was a likely possibility if something happened to your dad on way or another. Her suddenly protesting it out of nowhere is bizarre enough on it own, even more so considering she bears what seems to like NO responsibility in Mila's care.", "NTA!!

What was said in the heat of the argument was unfortunate though, and I hope things work out. \n\nBut, NTA even if you keep the dog over the gf.", "NTA.

You told Ellen ages ago that Mila might become part of your family.  She agreed.  Mila moved in four months ago and Ellen didn't object.  It's your house, your rules, your promise to your dad and Mila.  If Ellen thinks your place isn't big enough, she can move out.  That way, you and Mila will have plenty of space.  The only thing you need to \"think over\" is whether you want to reposition Mila's dog bed once Ellen's things are out of the way.\n\nOh, and for what it's worth, you can meet some very nice people (okay, women) walking Mila or taking her to a dog park.  One of my friends met his wife at the vet's office when he took his rescue pup (part St. Bernard) in for a checkup.  Okay, yeah, his wife IS the vet, but you get the idea.  What I'm saying is, there are women out there who will accept you and Mila both.  Honestly, the fact that you're taking care of her because of your promise to your dad will be seen as a plus by most women (I'm a woman so I kind of know these things) because it shows you are serious about honoring your commitments.\n\nCall Ellen.

Keep the dog, ditch the girlfriend.\n\nAlso, dog tax", "NTA\n\nHaving a dog in the house because she works at home is just her resentment over having Mila there, not that Mila interferes with her work. You pay expenses for Mila and she resents that too. Demanding Mila be sent away is cruel, Mila is not a young dog and chances are no one would take her as their new family member. Plus you made a promise to your Dad and most important, Mila is family, a pet yes but our pets are our family.\n\nWe have two Huskies who are indoor dogs, housetrained, sometimes underfoot when we do projects around the house yet we don't get resentful that they interfere in our daily lifestyles.\n\nPlease don't let your girlfriend, her friends or family convince you Mila needs to leave your house.", "NAH.

And she knew about it before she moved in.", "`Ellen said that if I loved her, I would make other arrangements, and at this stage I was getting a bit angry so what I said next may have been a little harsh.` \n\nThat was a super, super, super, unacceptable, manipulative thing to say. Like I get it, there are some relationships I've been in where I've felt like hey, you keep doing this thing that is hurting my feelings, and if you loved me, **you would find a way to work through this with me** (not just do what I want)**.** But, IF I ever even said that, it would be MONTHS after trying to work through and talk about it. \n\nWhat you are doing is not actively affecting her. You are taking care of the dog and being responsible. The finances do not fall on her. The dog is well-behaved. \n\nThe two of you have not tried to work through it or find a point of compromise. She did not suggest you do that. And it's revealing that the quote above is basically the first thing she jumped to when she didn't get her way in the situation. \n\nThis is a hard situation. Your dad is sick. She should be trying to make things easier for you. And to try and find a point of compromise regarding the dog, especially since she knew about the dog ahead of time. \n\nYou were reacting to her trying to be manipulative, being emotionally insensitive, then make it seem like you're doing something wrong when you're not, and get away with it. Did you handle it in the best way? Probably not. But I think her approach to this is fundamentally flawed, self-centered, and callous. \n\nIf you give in on this, that sets a not great precedent, imho. \n\nLastly, love is not a zero sum game. You can love her, the dog, and your father all at once and try to do right by each of them. Just because you're trying to do right by your dad, doesn't somehow mean you don't love her. And that's what I mean by dangerous precedent. I would be wary of anyone who would view a relationship in this way and think that they need to be my priority in all situations, all the time, despite reasonable actions and other priorities that pop up. If she actually cared about you, she would understand this and try to come to some sort of compromise. Not strong arm into what SHE wants.\n\nI wish you the best of luck. NTA.", "NTA.
