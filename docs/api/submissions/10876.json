Before I had even met Ellen I made a promise with my dad to take Mila in if he couldn't care for her, which is something I discussed with Ellen before she even moved in, and she had no complaints then.\n\n\nMy dad fell ill four months ago, and of course I took Mila in. He is not getting better, so he asked me to officially adopt her and I agreed. Ellen was furious that I made this decision without consulting her, despite me having told her about the arrangement in the past. Although I feed, walk, groom and manage all of Mila's needs, financially and otherwise, Ellen said she had to 'put her foot down' on this issue.\n\n\nI asked Ellen if there were any specific\u00a0 reasons she was so opposed us keeping Mila, and she stated the following:\n\n- She said that since she works from home full time (whereas I'm closer to 50/50) that I can't understand how much having a dog around affects her work (she makes clay art, crockery, that sort of thing)\n- Having a dog is expensive, and it will be a drain on our finances (which are not joined, I'll note, and I've paid for everything so far)\n- It will make it more difficult for us if we ever want to have a child\n- Our house is not huge, so it doesn't make sense to have a big dog like Mila\n- She has friends who have severe dog hair allergies, and she doesn't want them to feel they can't visit anymore\n\n\n[None of her complaints had anything to do with any bad behavior. Mila does not jump on people or furniture, bite, bark at visitors, she will follow commands to leave a room if they're given to her etc.]\n\n\nI see that these are reasonable objections to not taking Mila in but I stayed firm in my position. Ellen said that if I loved her, I would make other arrangements, and at this stage I was getting a bit angry so what I said next may have been a little harsh. I told her \"Love has nothing to do with this. My first responsibilities are my dad and Mila, and nothing you say will convince me to send her away. If you seriously can't cope with that, you can get out of my home.\"\n\n\nEllen burst into tears at this and left to go stay with her mom, citing that I clearly need time to 'think this over'. A bunch of her friends who know me have been telling me that I'm a total AH for prioritizing a dog over my girlfriend of nearly three years, but my own friends have been telling me to stand my ground. Ellen has been radio silent, has not come home and is not responding to my texts. So I guess I'm looking for some unbiased opinions on the matter.

She knew in advance, but was just hoping it would never happen. The world needs more people like you who place value on keeping your word and knowing the value of an animal. \nKeep the dog. If you give in now, you'll always be giving in to her and you'll always regret not keeping the dog. \nA dog is probably the only thing on earth, beside your parents, who will love you unconditionally.", "NTA. This is not a new issue. All successful relationships/marriages are based on compromise. You communicated this to her before and she understood. This isn't some random dog. At this point with your father falling ill, it could actually be a therapy dog too, when you visit him. Knowing that his dog is being taken care of by his son surely feeds his spirit during this difficult time and for your gf to use this as a \"If you love me\" moment and make you choose? She lost and she should have. And she'll use this line in the future too, which is extremely manipulative. I've been with my husband for close to 24 years and neither one of us has ever said that. If you break now with that line, be ready for her to use it over and over, just to get her way.", "NTA. You clearly communicated the plan prior to her ever moving in. On top of that, does she consider the REASON you\u2019re taking in the dog, the illness of your father. It\u2019s pretty inconsiderate for her to make this situation about her when you\u2019re doing a solid for your sick dad.\n\nIf you already had a dog before she moved in, would she not have moved in? Would she have told you to give up your dog? I don\u2019t think so!", "Nta! And you said she knew about this arrangement with your dad. While I only understand one of her reasons and that\u2019s her work, the rest the dog wouldn\u2019t affect as long as it\u2019s properly trained. As for her friends being allergic, they can take an allergy pill before coming over", "You\u2019re in a tough one. \n\nI get her being an artist and feeling her work is altered by the dog but there are simple solutions to this without having to get rid of the dog. Like, she can do her work in a room Mila doesn\u2019t have access to. \n\nShe gave you an ultimatum that was not fair. You were honoring a promise that you had before you met Ellen and she was aware of and agreed to the promise. Now she\u2019s complaining. That\u2019s on her. \n\nNow where things get sticky is where you tell her you prioritize your dad and Mila over your gf. Regardless of who the AH is you\u2019re going to want to sort this out with Ellen or prepare to lose your gf over this arrangement. You basically told her straight up my dad and my dog mean more to me than you do. That\u2019s probably why she is so upset. This might be true at your stage of relationship but sometimes you can be less blunt. \n\nThat said, YWNBTA for keeping Mila.", "Your girlfriend is testing the boundaries. And she\u2019s wrong. Her friends telling you that you\u2019re the AH are only getting a skewered side of the story.\n\nShe can\u2019t use the \u201cexpensive\u201d card.

Your word is your bond. \n\nHas Ellen even considered your dad\u2019s feelings if he were to learn that you gave Mila away? \n\nDoes she really want you to be the kind of person who breaks their word? \n\nHer excuses are lame and largely manufactured. It seems like a weird power flex. Maybe this is her first opportunity to \u201ctest\u201d your love and loyalty, and she\u2019s testing your word to your dad and an animal\u2019s life against your love for her.", "NTA, my crazy mother told all her bf's that her priorities were her kids, her dog, and then a bf. There was a few good things about her and this was one.\n\nEverything about the dog's behaviour makes me further confirm NTA, and if this is what you're going through and your gf throws you this ultimatum... not cool... Extremely selfish and dramatic\n\nEdit: you're", "Sounds like you used some harsh words toward gf, however she did know that you were in the queue to take Mila in if your dad was to decline. If that was truly clearly communicated and she agreed, then you are NTA. Possibly apologize to gf for using harsh language but stand firm in keeping both Mila and gf, offer ways to compromise to break the radio silence.", "NTA\n\nYour girlfriend is selfish and manipulative. She gave you her approval to have the dog just to turn around and throw a tantrum  when you followed through. Her statement saying that if you loved her, you\u2019d get rid of the dog is SO manipulative and wrong.", "NTA - one thing to consider is that dogs are very emotional and Mila is likely very sad to be missing your dad. Throwing her into a stranger's home would further traumatize her and could lead to depression. Dogs are also tough and she'd likely bounce back, but rescue dogs usually go through a lot. The fact your gf doesn't even consider this is telling. I don't know her, but I would hesitate to raise a child with someone so cold hearted.", "NTA -  You made a promise and you talked to her about it.  It wasn't an issue because she never thougt it would happen.\n\n\"If you love me blah blah blah\" - That is emoional  manipulation.  That one comment alone would make me tell her to take a hike.  People that use that are manipulative - dump her, keep the dog.  With this comment she is showing her true colors.", "A dog is expensive and will drain your expenses but a child won't? Keep the dog ditch the manipulator", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds like she never wanted the dog around to begin with, but just agreed with whatever you said in order to move in. She probably thought that once she was living in your home, you\u2019d become so enthralled by her that you\u2019d do whatever she said. Boy, was she in for a surprise. \n\nHer reasons are flailing, and show that she\u2019s just trying to spew out whatever she can think of, and hoping something will stick. When that didn\u2019t work, she resorted to the, \u201cIf YoU lOvE mE\u2026\u201d garbage. \n\nYou have one father. Girlfriends will come and go. \n\nWhy would you want to have a child with someone who doesn\u2019t like dogs, anyway?", "NTA. You pay for the dog and the dog is well behaved. If your girlfriend had an allergic reaction, it would've been different. I'd say the dog stays, if I were you I would do the same.", "NTA\n\nThe dog is family.  She deserves to be treated like a princess. Either ditch the GF or have a proper sit down discussion where you state you are not going to give up the dog but is there anything that could make life easier for her - the GF that is.", "NTA from your description of the situation.  This agreement predated your relationship, you pay for everything, etc.  The only leg she has to stand on is potentially the dog hair/allergy issue, but again, she agreed to it beforehand.  Guess she found out her ultimatum didn't work.", "NTA, in my experience dogs often help to bring out the true nature of people.\n\nAllergic here btw, I love visiting people with dogs though because I can just pop a pill and enjoy giving scratches and cuddles for a few hours, sorry to all my friends for being too focused on the four leged friendo sometimes...", "NTA\n\nIf she loved you, she would understand that you are giving your sick father peace of mind by providing a home to his beloved pet when he is not well enough to take care of her himself something she knew may happen prior to you living together.\n\nIf she loved you, she would respect you keeping your promises to someone you love as it shows that you only make promises you can keep.\n\nWhy is it more important that her friends can visit over you keeping your promise to your dad?\n\nIs your home the only place she can see her friends with allergies, or can alternative arrangements be made so she can spend time with them?", "NTA your gf is a spoiled brat.", "NTA \nMila was a part of your life and you made commitments to her and your dad before your gf was even a possibility. You were open about this commitment from the beginning, if your gf had ANY issues with the possibility of living with a dog then she should have said something then. \nHer \u201creasons\u201d may seem valid at first glance, but they are more like excuses and grasping at straws. The only one that I MIGHT consider valid is the friends with allergies, but I still say those friends can either take an allergy pill once in a while depending on the severity of the allergy, or oh well they just don\u2019t come over and gf can visit them elsewhere. Excuses.", "NTA but i would have a serious talk with your girlfriend.\n\n/u/AwkwardCrow401 \n\nEverything you said shows that except the fact that they both exist in the same house, your dog isn't the problem.\n\nYour girlfriend agreed prior moving into your house that you taking your dog isn't a problem.\n\nShe lied.\n\nI don't know if she thought that that moment when you take your dog home won't come, or if she thought she'll make you change your mind before that, the fact is that \"she had no complaints then\".\n\nHer reasons for not wanting your dog into your house are absurd. So:\n\n- your dog never broke or messed up anything of hers or in the house - or else she would have told exactly that.\n\n- she doesn't do a thing for the dog, all the care and financial issues being your responsability.\n\n- her friends might have allergy at food, meds - would that mean you will have to throw away everything because sometimes they might come over? What if one friend is a super-vegan (polite way to say), you will never eat meat?  What if one of them would not like your kids -what does she expects you to do with the kids?\n\nMy point is that you cannot live your life to accomodate her friends.\n\n> But you must understand that she pulled the friends'allergy thing not because they asked, but because she needs to give you multiple reasons.\n\nAnd if the friends really asked, they aren't entitled to dictate what happens in your house.\n\n- I don't understand in which way having a dog in your house can stop you from having kids. \n\nHonestly, i don't even want to speculate.\n\n- Your house isn't huge and so far you managed to live with the dog for the last 4 months.\n\nEven if you buy a bigger house, there will never ever be enough space for your dog in it because there isn't enough space in her heart for your dog.\n\n>I will tell you something that might help you see things as I see them.\n\nI am a dog person. At one of my first dates with my now husband i was saying that i love dogs, but i don't want to get one because all my life i had to care for all my family's pets and i ended up hating it. They had the fun part, i had the rest.\n\nThen he asked me what do i think about cats, would o like one? I laughed and said i really don't like cats. They're not my type. I wouldn't live with a dog, which i would like, why would i live with a cat. \n\nI saw him looking a little uncomfortable so i asked him what it's wrong.\n\nEdit to finish my comment\n\nSo he said he has a cat. I asked him the name. \"Cat\". Me: Well, i think nobody will ever guess the cat's name (i was joking). Him: Really? Me: Yes, it's as rare as John Smith.\n\nWe laughed and after another dates, i went to his house. He was... Waiting for something to happen and i didn't understood right then.\n\nHis cat came to me, smelled me and asked for food, then left.\n\nHe looked shocked.\n\nApparently his cat doesn't like people, very few weren't bitten, scratched or spit on. Neither of his girlfriend were liked by his cat.\n\nSo the cat likes me, for who knows what reason. And even though my husband told me he will take care of the cat, in time things changed and he rarely cares for the cat.\n\nThe cat was his friend for many years and i don't know why, he doesn't act exactly like a cat.\n\nHe's more like a dog in a cat'skin.\n\nAnd the cat became my family too. I still won't take a dog or another pet, when our cat will be gone.\n\nWhy? Because cat isn't some pet, he's family.\n\nEdit to correct \"we'll\"", "NAH. \nShe has valid reasons to not want a dog.\nFor you, the dog is family. \n\nNeither of you are unreasonable, but you need to be aware that if one of you won't compromise it may end your relationship", "YWNBTA.", "NTA- your dad was very responsible arranging care for the dog, and you are very responsible for following through.

There's disease, disability, a million things that not necessarily are dependent on age and age only. Yes, one would expect that if nothing bad happens, the average person will reach 80yo or whatever and the dog would be long dead by then. But the thing is that life is unpredictable. \n\nAnd according to her objections...I don't see them that reasonable considering their circumstances. \n\n-If the finances are not combined yet, the dog isn't putting a dent on her bank account so as long as OP is okay paying, she has no right to complain about that. The promise preceded the girlfriend so in this case, that comment makes her sound entitled to me.  \n\n-Having a dog makes having children harder. Yes, that's why there are only dogs in childfree houses. \n\n-She needs her space to work. Okay, perfectly fair, close the door. Like you would to if it was kids and you're a parent working from home. \n\n-Her friends can't visit because they are allergic. --- What a shame! Let's get rid of a dog who already came from a rescue, who right now is separated from her original owner but at least with his son, and send her back to the shelter or give her to strangers just so some people can come home and have coffee once a week if not less. People who could meet in any other place, or at any other friend's house.....like the thousands of friendships that are still kept despite people having pets and their friends being allergic to them.", "You're still missing the point. You should have talked to her **before** taking Mila in, this is what a respectful partner does. The fact the you don't get it is exactly the problem in your relationship. \n\nI'm not saying give Mila up, and if I were in your place I would have also agreed to take her in no questions asked. But I still would have said to my husband \"ok, this is the situation, we have to take the dog in. What arrangements do we have to make to make sure you're also comfortable with the dog in the house\". Then you sit down and discuss, and come to a compromise. \n\nYou didn't do that, you arranged everything as you saw fit without a proper discussion. You didn't give her a choice in how any of this is managed. You keeping a promise to your dad doesn't mean having to treat your gf like a piece of furniture. \n\nAnd yes, if you don't treat your gf like an equal partner then you need to look into why you're doing that.", "In this circumstance, respectfully agree to disagree \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "He is not. She is putting her BS before her boyfriend and the promise he made.", "I wouldn\u2019t break your word. Your girlfriend knew and had no complaints. It\u2019s not her money being used to take care of the dog, tell her to keep her art where the dog can\u2019t get to it. Bottom line is you made a commitment to your father who is now ill and doesn\u2019t need added stress.", "I have to give this an award. What a wonderful approach to take to owning a pet.\n\nI will add: Ellen is especially TA because Mia isn\u2019t difficult or dangerous\u2026she\u2019s just inconvenient for Ellen plus she doesn\u2019t like you spending your money on a dog. As your partner, she should understand this is important to you and part of the give and take of relationships.", "[removed]", "No. You\u2019re being downvoted because this is a commitment he made prior to them moving in together which she was made fully away of beforehand. Now that the dog is here, as previously agreed upon, she doesn\u2019t want it. Pets ARE family."]}
