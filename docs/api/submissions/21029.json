My BFF is Amy and my little brother is John. In the fall of 2019, John passed away tragically at only 15. He was hit by a car while riding his bike to school. John was a high-functioning autistic and had missed the bus that day, so he decided to ride his bike. My parents' driveway had a steap decline that led into the road. He rode down the driveway and lost control of the breaks. He then went into the road where he immediately was struck by a car going 55mph. He flew 30 feet into a nearby ditch. He was brain dead on impact and was soon rushed to the hospital. I was inconsolable and drove to the hospital as quickly as I could. When I arrived, they had already pronounced my brother dead. It was the worst day of my life. \n\nI called Amy and she drove 2 hours to our house. My whole family was distraught, and we couldn't believe that this happened right outside of our house. We all grabbed a beer and tried to calm down. I was so happy that Amy drove down to be with me in my time of need. She was the best, or so I thought. She decided that it was a good idea to run to the liquor store and purchase more booze. I was not really in the mood to drink and only had the one beer. When she got back, her and my grandfather, who was a bad alcoholic, kept drinking and drinking. As time went on, Amy got so drunk that she ended up puking everywhere. My sister and I carried her to the guest bedroom, and I stayed in bed with her so I could keep an eye on her. Then she started saying things that made no sense and then started convulsing. I was terrified. It got so bad to the point where I had to drive her to the hospital. The same hospital where my brother just died. When I brought her into the hospital and checked her in, the nurse asked if I was related to her. I said no, and they told me I would have to wait outside. They assured me that she would be fine, but I was not allowed in. There, I sat in the same exact chair in the same waiting room twice in one day. I was shaking with so many emotions. \n\nI could not find her phone and didn't have her parents' number, so I drove to their house and told her parents where she was and what was going on. Then I just left and went home to be with my family. The next day, I awoke with text messages from her sister's phone. Amy was yelling at me and asked why I just left her in the hospital and went and told her parents that she was drunk. She said I was an awful friend. I snapped and told to don't bother coming to the funeral. I had to end up taking care of her in the toughest moment in my life. Her family and some of mine think iatah for not just staying with her to make sure that she was okay, but my siblings and I think that she should have been responsible for herself and should have been there to help me through my brother's death.

She should be grovelling for not being sober enough to provide support that you needed. \n\nYou made sure she had medical care and her parents were aware.

You had just gone through something so awful there are no words, and she (your best friend) decides to get herself and your grandfather drunk?!

It\u2019s not like you abandoned her.

She made someone else loss all,about her then was mad u took care of her and made sure she was in a,place to get the help she absolutely needed. And did the right thing by letting her parents know. That's called being responsible, which considering what u were going thrunis just amazing. What Amy did is the exact opposite. She's just mad she got in trouble and rather than take responsibility for herself and her actions she wants it to b ur fault. It's not. And her response to all this is so not ok.

They wouldn't let you back in with her and what could you do to help her that the hospital wasn't already doing? When my dad died when I was 19, my friends at college didn't use it as an excuse to drink themselves to death.  They were there when I needed to vent or cry.  They supported me, knowing it was only 2.5 months after my grandmother died in almost the exact same way and that id be a mess.  They didn't make it about them. You deserved to have a friend who supported you, not made you support them in your hour of need. Your friend is the asshole in this situation along with everyone who thinks you did something wrong. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You did make sure she was safe. You took her to the hospital, the safest place she could be at that moment", "NTA OP.  She added to your trauma and stress with her stupidity and thoughtlessness.\n\nYou did the decent thing by taking her.  But, you didn't owe her a damn thing.\n\nI recommend you cut contact with her.

It\u2019s a shorty situation you\u2019re in and I\u2019m sorry that not even your parents can function enough to see that.
