We also had friends (a couple) come in from across the country that friday. Initially we were planning to go to a steakhouse for his birthday and as a get together. But unfortunately, he unexpectantly had to work so he couldn\u2019t make it. I asked our friends if they mind a last minute change to a fancy sushi place (all 3 of us love sushi, husband prefers steak, and doesn\u2019t even like raw fish).\n\nAnyways, it was definitely fancy. We did omakase with bunch of a la cart. The total for the 3 of us was over 1k.\n\n We celebrated his bday the next day at that steakhouse.\n\nI didn\u2019t tell him about the switch because I didn\u2019t want him to feel left out. Later he was asking if we were ok with eating steak twice in a weekend. So i had to tell him we had sushi. Unfortunately, our friends were really excited to share about our experience (their first time to omakase). He didn\u2019t say anything more about this but in private, he said I essentially celebrated his bday without him. I asked him what did he want me to do with friends across the country staying with us for just a weekend? Go to mcdonalds? So was I an AH for doing a \u201cmore fancy and expensive\u201d dinner without my husband on the night of his birthday because he couldn\u2019t join?\n\nEdit:\n\nI didn\u2019t tell him bc he was called into a horrible case and his patient died and he wasn\u2019t even on call. But also i didn\u2019t want him to feel left out (despite it was no one\u2019s fault). Felt guilty enjoying life while he was going through the wrenches.  He can\u2019t even tell me exactly why he felt upset. He\u2019s not mad.", "created_utc": 1695447575, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16pw853/aita_for_upgrading_dinner_plans_since_my_husband/", "score": 606, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he is honest to himself he knows noone who has a job where they could be called in wants their spouse to sit home in the dark w/o any sort of entertainment to solidarize in suffering with the working spouse, especially not if also friends are there who traveled long for this.\n\nIn my opinion it was even better this way. If you went alonge with the bday plans w/o him, that would have been a little weird, this way you just made sure your guests are not impacted by the impediment his work caused.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t get all the YTA in here at all.

I\u2019ll happily wait for steak and would hope they had a great time.", "Soft YTA. Yes, you could and should have gone to a nice place, but by choosing such an expensive and high-class restaurant you made this dinner the main event of your husband's birthday weekend, and his actual birthday just a \"side dish\".", "NAH.

Give him something he would value like extra time with you or what ever he really likes.", "NAH. You celebrated his birthday his way (steakhouse) on the night he was available and when he got called into work you treated his visiting friends to a unique experience that he would not have enjoyed. I get that he's upset that he missed out but that comes with being in the medical field.", "YTA\n\nYou spent over $300/person for a meal that he couldn\u2019t attend on his own birthday. No, you shouldn\u2019t be expected to go to McDonald\u2019s, but there\u2019s a huge gap between a $10 value meal and a $300 dinner. \n\nHe\u2019s right in that you essentially celebrated his birthday without him. And you didn\u2019t tell him because you didn\u2019t want him to feel left out, which pretty much implies that you knew it was an experience that he was missing, not just a meal with friends.", "NAH life happens. His celebration was postponed, he didn't miss it. You can offer him to invite him to sushi next time so he doesn't feel left out.

Seems illogical so going with NTA.", "YTA. Why did you keep it from him in the first place? You had an extra extravagant meal without him, on his birthday, I think he is entitled to feel left out. It's not like he chose to bail that evening? Did you have to upgrade the setting? Why not take them out to an equally nice restaurant? Surely he knew you were still going out to eat with them, but I don't know why anyone would assume you were going to do something truly decadent instead of the same plan. Don't you think he felt like his dinner was not as special because of the fact that you went somewhere so crazy the night before?\n\nAnd holy mackerel. What kind of fish costs over 1k? Did you eat Poseidon's pet fish, or an Orca whale?\n\n---\n\n> I didn\u2019t tell him bc he was called into a horrible case and his patient died and he wasn\u2019t even on call.

You made the sushi dinner the main event, rather than his birthday. \n\nHe is probably feeling weird because while you were feasting on ridiculously expensive fish with your friends, he was spending his birthday trying to save someone and it went bad. He is going to be all out of sorts from the stress and disappointment and needs some compassion.", "YTA for acting like you dont know why hes upset. Its not the money, its the being left out and having to hear all about what a fun and great time you all had without him when the great and fun time should have been a celebration of him.", "YTA-it was fine that you switched restaurants without your husband. It\u2019s the scale of the restaurant is a problem. Three of you spent 1K on dinner\u2014that\u2019s a major event\u2014when it was supposed to just be a normal evening with friends so you could celebrate later.

He wasn't there and already aimed you had gone to the dinner anyway. \n\nMy guess is his feelings are less about what you did and more mixed with missing the good time to have to go and have a really shitty time instead but that is not something either of you could control. Hence NAH", "NTA You entertained your guests. What is the issue? I feel like he is carrying over work stress, but you seem to have handled the situation well.", "YTA. Going to such a fancy place without him on his birthday is bad optics. A simpler place or home-cooked meal would be understandable but going all out when he's not able to come feels like kicking him while he's down.", "YTA for so many reasons. Since the birthday boy couldn't be there the dinner should have been low key. Sure have sushi, but at a regular restaurant with normal prices. Plus why didn't you focus on how to make your husband's birthday better when he got home. And the way you handled it made your husband feel left out.", "YTA. Enjoying life despite bad stuff happening isn\u2019t wrong. Otherwise we all would go crazy because messed up stuff happens 24/7. But \u201cenjoying life\u201d (treating yourself and your friends to a fancier dinner than was planned for him) while *your own spouse* had a patient die on *his birthday* does suck. He might not be able to tell you about what upset him right now because he\u2019s dealing with a traumatic experience and his emotions are probably all over the place.", "YTA I'm sorry OP but that's a ridiculous amount for a dinner with just 3 people. Curious to know what 4 at the steakhouse cost?", "YTA, lot of sociopaths in the comments here. Yeesh.", "YTA maybe it's because I'm from a different culture. This, to me, is an incredibly hard hearted thing to do, no excuses. Your friends had flown in to spend time with you both. Your husband, on his birthday, had to work, and work an emotionally draining shift. Just terrible for him. And instead of thinking of your husband, you're more interested in trying out a fancy sushi restaurant to look after them and try it yourself. \n\nWhat about the bloke you married? \n\nWas there even anything for him to eat when he got home? Did you leave him a birthday cupcake in the fridge or do anything thoughtful for him when he got back exhausted? \n\nNothing wrong with going out with friends but come on, this was such a selfish thing to do something so amazing when he was working and on his birthday! If you can't feel in your conscience this was lousy behaviour to him, then you need to take a long hard look at who you've become. \n\nYou could have made an easy meal such as chilli, garlic bread with a bottle of red for you and your friends, and had a nice low key night at your place catching up. This was after all the point of them coming that weekend, to spend time with you both. That would have then made the birthday dinner the next night the main celebration.  As it was, you already had a celebration amongst the 3 of you. No wonder he's become unable to relate his feelings to you.", "NTA. He couldn\u2019t come so you did something he doesn\u2019t enjoy that you and your guests really do and did.  Still doing the steakhouse dinner with him, on a night he can attend. All good.", "YTA.

Your husband does not even like sushi. \n\nUnfortunately, your husband's work situation got in the way.

Understandable. \n\nYou did what he wanted for his birthday. \n\nHe\u2019s upset because he missed a nice evening with friends. Also understandable.", "NAH. I think it was fine to go out with your friends and have a really nice fun meal. \n\nI also get that your husband feels left out since he got called into work. And he lost a patient. It\u2019s a no win situation. I think kindness is key here. \n\nTell him you wished he was there but you are also allowed to enjoy your friends too. Ask a bunch of questions if he often feels left out or what\u2019s at the bottom of it.

The fact that you didn\u2019t tell him as part of an everyday conversation, I think you know that.", "YTA - you lied by omission.

The change of venue is a real win-win since the remaining guests like sushi while the guest of honor likes steak. So they had his birthday steak dinner on another night when he was available.

What sort of partner would not just cancel and re-arrange plans if the person those plans where for could not make it?", "Though I dont think money is the issue it seems that you celebrated your friends and made your husband an afterthought.

So I think he feels like his birthday became secondary - which isn't the end of the world - but he was probably really happy that his friends came to town from across the country to spend it with him - and now his birthday is secondary to it all. \n\nIt's one of those things that isn't rational but just takes the shine off something you were really excited/ happy/honoured about. \n\nI'm not saying you should have done something boring or cheap, but you basically picked something that was a level-up from what they were coming for.", "NAH you need to sit down and have a good long honest talk with each other when emotions aren't so high.", "I believe NAH, really.\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong. In fact, what were you supposed to do? Not entertain the guests? Eat steak twice in a row? And what you picked was something your husband would not have ever enjoyed? And you celebrated his birthday the next day - WITH the steak dinner that he was looking forward to.\n\nSo, your husband is upset even though the logic doesn't quite support him. He actually did think you had stuck to the plan and had eaten steak two days in a row. But you've noted how (1) emotionally draining and traumatic his birthday night was and (2) how personally disappointing it was for him. He absolutely deserves a little time to be more emotional than logical. And deserves some understanding and support for having to process all those emotions. I think that would go a long way toward getting you both to a good place about this.\n\nSome are saying that you shouldn't have had such a great dinner, a more toned-down dinner would have been better. I do imagine that the specialness of that particular dinner probably is adding to his feeling of disappointment that this great dinner happened on his birthday without him. (Even though it would not have been a great dinner to him). Again, sympathy, understanding and support for what he's feeling is in order. But I also would offer in your defense that\n\n1. It was fortuitous those friends were there with you on a night when he had to work. It allowed all three of you to enjoy and share something that only you three wanted to do. When would you have ever had that meal with your husband?\n2. You are a doctor's spouse. I imagine you have had your share of evenings and outings canceled because of his job. You deal with it because he's your husband and he signed up for that when he chose his career. To me, that's all the more reason you should get to enjoy a special night when you could create one from the ashes of your original plans.\n3. That's where, after your husband has had a chance to process his emotions, I hope he gives you the grace and support and understanding to be happy for you that you did get to have a special evening with those friends.\n\nIn my romantic little heart, I'd like to envision this mutual grace leading to you both feeling even closer to each other and deciding to go out again. For another special dinner - something romantic for just the two of you :)", "NTA\u2026you did not celebrate his birthday without him.  You celebrated seeing friends who came to visit you for one weekend, from out of the country.  Yes, they were excited, but not about his birthday, but that they got to try something new.  Your husband has a job where he might get called away at last minute.  Your life does not stop because of that.

What was he really doing that he couldn't say no to knowing, you already had plans for the evening for his birthday? This shows a lack of respect at the very least!\n\nI would have done the same, hey I like a good steak as much as the next Guy, but a chance for some fancy food at another place is to good to pass up.\n\nAnd in any case he got his steak the next night.", "OP., The \u201ckeep it from him\u201d about where you went, is bullshit\u2026 you and every other readers knows it! I don\u2019t think he would have been upset that you went for sushi instead since he doesn\u2019t like it, but to go to overboard on his birthday without him, was an asshole move and you know it! (Hence) \u201cI kept it from him\u201d and the visitors were the ones that let him know! (Not even his wife-WTF) Lady you sound like a very manipulative person.

It makes sense that you would do the sushi place, the preference of both you and your guests, when he was unavailable. \n\nHis friends flew all the way across the country to see him, but he was unable to go out that night. It makes sense that you took them out for a treat.", "NTA  - I guess I'm a minority here.  I think if he got upset you switched dinner choices that's on him. It makes sense to eat something that he wouldn't be a fan of with others who like that food while visiting for a while. I don't understand why he thinks you celebrated his birthday without him - did he expect you all just to leave? Plus if he doesn't like sushi - you probably wouldnt get a chance to do this restaurant anyways with him - it's not something he'd enjoy or like. I think... his feeling may be hurt especially after a tough day at work that you went to a nice restaurant without him on his birthday- even if it isn't a place hed like.

What matters is that his birthday was celebrated properly. There was zero point to stick to old plans of doing steakhouse when your husband couldn\u2019t attend, so it made more sense changing plans to what you and guests enjoyed. Your husband like you said dislikes raw fish so he\u2019s petty to even feel negative about you guys won\u2019t sticking out to the original plan.

Average to about 300 a piece, while at a reputable steakhouse can easily rack up similar price if not a little lower. Choosing what the guests and you like seems way more practical than to sticking out and having steak twice. \n\nWhatever stress he had at work, he\u2019s taking it out on you and that\u2019s a bad sign.

We also had friends (a couple) come in from across the country that friday. Initially we were planning to go to a steakhouse for his birthday and as a get together. But unfortunately, he unexpectantly had to work so he couldn\u2019t make it. I asked our friends if they mind a last minute change to a fancy sushi place (all 3 of us love sushi, husband prefers steak, and doesn\u2019t even like raw fish).\n\nAnyways, it was definitely fancy. We did omakase with bunch of a la cart. The total for the 3 of us was over 1k.\n\n We celebrated his bday the next day at that steakhouse.\n\nI didn\u2019t tell him about the switch because I didn\u2019t want him to feel left out. Later he was asking if we were ok with eating steak twice in a weekend. So i had to tell him we had sushi. Unfortunately, our friends were really excited to share about our experience (their first time to omakase). He didn\u2019t say anything more about this but in private, he said I essentially celebrated his bday without him. I asked him what did he want me to do with friends across the country staying with us for just a weekend? Go to mcdonalds? So was I an AH for doing a \u201cmore fancy and expensive\u201d dinner without my husband on the night of his birthday because he couldn\u2019t join?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", " Maybe he\u2019s upset as it sounds you 3 had more fun trying Omakase -  then his birthday dinner and feels left out. Unfortunately can\u2019t be helped but I\u2019d treat him to fun night out", "He wouldn't have felt left out if you had steak without him? He would rather you do HIS dinner choice without him and then go it again with him? \nI don't get it", "Even if you have a lot of money, a thousand bucks is a lot of money for dinner. I would agree with your husband.", "This is a complex one. I have a feeling it\u2019s tied, at least in part, to the case he was called in on. \n\nIt\u2019s a jarring juxtaposition to realize that while he was called in on his birthday (when he was not on call \u2014 that\u2019s how bad it was) and fighting either to keep a patient alive or having to rehash his actions to his superiors, you were out with mutual friends enjoying $1K of dinner. Celebrating being together. It\u2019s a lot of cognitive dissonance to process. \n\nBecause this is such a specific instance, I\u2019m gonna go with NAH. You didn\u2019t mean anything by it, and he\u2019s probably trying to not be offended. \n\nMake sure he gets the mental health support that\u2019s available. There\u2019s definitely a cultural \u201cpush through it\u201d thing he\u2019s battling, and that helps no one.", "Nta", "So you celebrated his birthday while he was at work. NAH u had to entertain the quest. If u went to McDonald's you could gotten hubby a Happy Meal with a prize in it. Lol.", "NTA. You celebrated with him the next day, the night he wasn\u2019t present was just a dinner with friends. It\u2019s understandable he feeling left out and a little upset he couldn\u2019t go, but would be selfish of him to expect you to cancel everything.", "NAH. Him being bummed is valid, you wanting to still provide your friends with a good dinner and getting to enjoy something your husband wouldn't want seems fine IMO. I don't like all the same food as my husband (or atleast far less frequently), so we both take opportunities here and there to get the things we enjoy without the other. I think it being his birthday may a factor, but you guys shouldn't be blamed for enjoying life while he answered a work call in. He can't expect you to stay on hold for his job. If you'd gone to his favorite place, I could see him having a stronger argument.", "I didn\u2019t tell him because i felt bad he had to work on his bday while i treated our friends to their first omakase. I also would probably not bring him to something like that bc he doesn\u2019t like raw fish and you can modify omakase. It just felt weird. \n\nI guess i didn\u2019t want him to know or feel bad we had fun while he had to work a horrible shift but i also didn\u2019t want our friends to waste a weekend.  They did fly out here for his birthday and to visit us. \n\nI found out the next morning he lost a patient so even more reason to not talk about it.", "Agree with NAH. I'm surprised at the number of Y T A responses. What was she supposed to do with her guests, just sit at home because the husband had to work?? As long as there's not an issue with spending that amount of money, which it doesn't sound like there is, I don't see the problem. Plus, it does not sound like she knew that the patient had died until the next day. I'm sure husband was bummed he had to work, and even more so that it was a sad/difficult night, but I think wife was well within her rights to still take her friends out to dinner, considering they had flown into town to visit them.", "100% agree NAH. \n\nHe doesn't like sushi and OP doesn't care for steak, so going when he was unavailable was the perfect scenario. Naturally, as said above, this is assuming that the cost wasn't highly unusual. I would also understand not telling him right off because he was likely upset about his patient.\n\nI also understand him being upset about missing the evening and his birthday with his friends.", "Same here! I don't get it either. She didn't know his patient was dying at the time she took them out. She took them to a place his friends, who traveled across the country, would enjoy. If they can afford it, the price is irrelevant. Also, the husband picked the place he wanted! \n\nShe says she didn't want to brag about the place when she found out what happened. It's not like she would have hidden what they did had his night turned out differently. I would have wanted my friends to have a good time also.", "Completely agree here. He doesn\u2019t like sushi and they went to the exact steakhouse the next day! People need to grow up about their birthdays\u2026 he was (unfortunately) unavailable the day of his birthday so they did something he doesn\u2019t like. Since they did this they kept the original birthday plans specially for his birthday.", "Ah maybe this.\n\nHe isn\u2019t the best with his own feelings so he wasn\u2019t even able to tell me why he was bothered and felt upset.", "That's exactly right. He's hurt because on the night he was called into work to attend to a horrific case, his wife had a massive blow out dinner without him.", "I also didn\u2019t twll him bc he went in on his birthday due to mass casualty. He\u2019s not even a trauma surgeon. He was just one of the few who could go in despite not being on call.\n\nAnd his patient died - so i didn\u2019t want to be like \u201clook at all thw cool things we did! While you slaved away trying to save someone and they still died\u201d", "lol what? OP entertained hubby\u2019s guests while he was callled into work and they celebrated his birthday the following day. dinner with the friends wasn\u2019t a birthday event. it was just dinner.", "He wasn\u2019t the guest of honor though. He had to back out of the dinner unexpectedly due to work, at that point it was no longer a birthday celebration, it was just three friends getting dinner. \n\nHe still got the birthday dinner he wanted at the steakhouse he wanted. Expecting people to not have a good time because you\u2019re not there is incredibly selfish, and it\u2019s especially selfish when you\u2019re the one who backed out.", "What\u2019s expensive is relative. He\u2019s a surgeon, so I doubt the money is the part that is bothering him. \n\nAs the spouse of a doctor, you become accustomed to them missing events or holidays. You can\u2019t let it bring you down or stop you from experiencing life. She\u2019s kinda right. He doesn\u2019t like fish, they probably wouldn\u2019t want steak two nights in a row, and she was entertaining her guests. He\u2019s probably mostly stressed about how emotionally and physically taxing his career is, and is misdirecting that frustration..", "Just because $1000 is expensive to many it is still relative, they obviously have the funds for doing this, this isn't about the price.", "He doesn't even like raw fish. He is not jealous of the sushi, he just thinks they should have not had fun without him which is not a fair expectation when some people have crossed the country to hang out with you. Were they supposed to sit at home and starve?", "OP had omakase. That\u2019s a very normal price to pay for the experience. OP is NTA for creating their guests to something they all enjoy.", "He wasn't excluded. He couldn't come. \n\nThe friends are there for a limited time.\n\nThey would not have gone there, as he doesn't like sushi. \n\nI get maybe he has some FOMO, but I hate a specific cuisine and I'm not gonna judge my husband for seeking it out when his brother visits or something. He still got his birthday dinner.", "Why does the price matter when he doesn't even eat sushi?", "They are food he wouldn't even like!! How is that excluding him?! They did the thing he wanted to do when he was available. It wasn't his fault he couldn't make it, but like... they can have fun and eat too!", "No it\u2019s not for a really nice dinner. The guests were from across country. Bday boy cancelled and still got his dinner.", "Money is relative sweetheart. $1k to the wealthy is a drop in the bucket. NTA to OP", "OP was COVERING for her husband, who was an AH to his guests.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd \"enormous price\" depends on your level of income.", "Him asking if she was cool eating steak two days in a row kinda shows that his head is wrapped up in the patient because that is a pretty bizarre thing to assume.\n\nI\u2019m going with NAH but being mindful of upstaging the birthday dinner is a consideration that I don\u2019t think was at the front of her mind. I doubt the husband is really that petty about it. It\u2019s the mix of death and missing out that actually bothering him.\n\nNo one wants to lose a patient on their birthday.\n\nThere\u2019s no way that he really wants her and the guest from out of town to put their lives on hold because he has a high stress job. It comes with the territory. He\u2019s just having a hard time dealing with the stress.", "Don't agree at all. You can also get up to $1000 at certain steakhouses and high end sushi is not always more expensive. The price shows it was a fancier experience and therefore, made his actual birthday celebration the side gig. Oh, and obvious YTA.", "Used to commercial fish. Had to work in a Japanese market during covid. Based on the store price, one damn clam would come out to about two grand, which is insane as we only got about 4 bucks a pound. Big clams though.", "It was probably the Holy Mackerel that was so expensive, yeah.", "My friends never had omakase. And my husband doesn\u2019t like raw fish. So i thought this is s chance for me to treat them to omakase. Which alone is like 200$ per person. Each piece from a la cart is like 15+. Then tax and tips brought us to 1k ish.\n\nI let him pick his favorite steak house because i am not a huge fan of steak so i wouldn\u2019t know what was good. Idk the diff between ribeye and nystrip.", "I do wonder how Orca tastes now", "The husband was left out BY HIS DOING. That's on HIM. HE did this.", "Same. This is where I'm at too. On one hand, having such an extravagant dinner is crazy but I know sushi is expensive and going when he isn't available is probably the most ideal time. On the other hand, keeping it from him was a bad decision. He probably is sad he missed out on the birthday plans. I would be too. But also I understand that comes with anything in the medical field. I'm so torn.", "You don\u2019t know who these people and and their lifestyle.", "Not even a chain restaurant, but maybe a normal sushi place?", "Why?

Instead you had the main event without him, that's not loving, that's not kind, you get a birthday once a year. I'm sure your husband was looking forward to the evening just like the three of you were, he did the respectful thing by his job and that's understandable that the three of you were still going to go out to eat. The fact that you had the nicer main event without him is the issue, that is what is unloving here.\n\nI feel sorry for your husband, if you can't see this on your own and can't see this with feedback in Reddit, maybe you don't love your husband as much as he deserves.\n\n Just own it. You made a mistake.

I don't ever want you to feel as if you are not anything more than my main event.\n\nSheesh, whatever happened to really loving and adoring your spouse? I've made mistakes, many of us have, what I always do whether I agree with my husband feeling left out or not is I make sure that he knows how much I love him and how much I would never deliberately do anything to hurt him. Sometimes you just have to say the decision made in the moment in hindsight wasn't the best decision and I'm sorry.

When he\u2019s called in and they have guests seems like the perfect time to do something he\u2019s not into. \n\nThis seems like a dumb little marital spat. Her guests also chose to go to omakase. They were probably on vacation. It\u2019s unreasonable and silly to think they should have less fun because he couldn\u2019t join.", "Jesus! The money is irrelevant!!!", "Bruh he wasn't excluded from anything. They celebrated his birthday with a thing he would like to do. A steakhouse dinner. The sushi restaurant is a thing separate from the birthday celebration. The sushi dinner was just friends hanging out at a restaurant.  Couples don't have to be attached at the hip, they can do things separate from each other. Celebrating someone's birthday isn't about how fancy or expensive the celebration is. It's about doing something the person being celebrating would enjoy to show that you care about them. Op did a good job celebrating their spouse with something they would enjoy.", "And the fact that they specifically went to something that he would have not enjoyed means nothing? It's not being upstaged if it's a place he'd hate. The cost has nothing to do with it.", "I understood your point, but you keep stepping on it by obsessing about the cost.", "While they were eating dinner, they didn't know he lost the patient. That is not OP and friends' fault. If he doesn't like fish, and they wanted fish, why couldn't they eat the fish? Were they supposed to go to Long John Silver's instead? \n\nThe husband picked where he wanted to go for dinner. The fact that it was less is on him. If $1000 is spent on dinner, that means $1000 is not a lot of money to them. \n\nHis anger is misplaced. He can't even tell her why he's upset. It may just be that he knows they had a good time while he knows someone died.", "The guest of honor no showed because of his job which is fine and they went someplace that the guest of honor does not like. He doesn\u2019t like sushi and he doesn\u2019t like raw food. \n\nHe got his steak the next night. You\u2019re being really silly and argumentative for no reason.", "Wow, how many basic facts would you like to ignore? Everything about the post contradicts what you say.\n\nShe mentions her friends specifically gushing about the omakase - so the meal itself was special.\n\n\nShe dismisses McDonald's, so clearly not just any meal would do.\n\nNews flash, people do use money to indicate how special something is often. Or they put in effort and time (which she clearly didn't). Or they, you know, use the money earned from effort and time?!", "But whst has that to do with op taking out the friends to a restaurant the husband wouldn't enjoy anyways? Should one just stop living bc the partner has a stressful job?\nI worked in healthcare myself, have seen people die or worse. Sure, it sucks, and if you get called in on a day off it of course sucks more, but I never kept friends and family from enjoying their lives and I definitely wouldn't be salty about my partner taking our friends to a restaurant I won't enjoy anyways after they came across tge country to see us. \n\nIn this case it might have been a financial upgrade, yes, but to the husband that change would have been a downgrade personally.\n\nThe only wrong thing OP did was trying to jeep it as secret. Noone likes secrecy and in that case it was just so unnecessary and kinda stupid.", "it very clearly is.", "That's literally not what you conveyed at all. You equated the concept of being celebrated with the cost of the dinner. That's just incorrect; he got exactly what he wanted with the friends he wanted to celebrate with. We can make no assumptions about a \"difference in treatment.\"\n\nAlso you can't demonize OP for telling him about the dinner because she didn't. It was unfortunate that the friends didn't catch the cue about not discussing it openly, but if he didn't want to share what happened to him (which OP specifically says he doesn't) then no one had any way to know how he was feeling about it.", "The OP of this comment chain is literally making it about him, and painting him as a petty, selfish grump. He was called in during an emergency to save lives.", "Im sorry - I know this is the point when, as an adult especially - I should just agree to disagree because we're all entitled to our opinions etc, but god help me you sound like a 14 year old edgelord. Im the asshole here because i just have to tell you that.", "I think that\u2019s a really good move. If the two of you can get to the bottom of why he\u2019s feeling upset, it might give you the clarity you need to be able to apologize\u2026 Personally, I think an apology could be really helpful here, if you haven\u2019t offered one already. \n\nI also want to add that I think it\u2019s awesome that you\u2019re even willing to try and figure this out. Some people just wouldn\u2019t care. It shows that you want to do right by your partner!", "YTA. The first dinner should\u2019ve been more low key so when y\u2019all did go out for his bday, it was more special. \n\nVery rude of you.", "No they're not right. \n\nThe birthday dinner just became a birthday dinner. \n\nHe's upset that his patient died and he missed out on getting to relax for an evening. \n\nI doubt hes upset that you took them for sushi. \n\nIt was no longer his birthday dinner and instead just dinner. So it didn't matter where you went. \n\nYou cuod have gone to wendys, and he still would have bee upset. \n\nJust because you have dinner on hus birthday anywhere doesn't take away from his actual birthday celebration the next day. \n\nYour a adult and ant put your life on hold just for him. Your allowed to go out and have a good time without him. \n\nHe doesn't even like sushi, you shouldn't have to not go to expensive places just because he has work. \n\nIt doesn't matter that it was his birthday. He had work and you went out, to enjoy yourself and make the most of the night. \n\nI grunted your friends would have gone somewhere else for dinner instead of eating steak. \n\nI wouldn't go for steak 2 nights in a row and I like it. I would have gone out somewhere else and invited the host. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. Even he doesn't know why he's upset. And if that's the case then I doubt it's because you went for sushi on his birthday. \n\nYou weren't celebrating his birthday, it was just dinner. You celebrated the next night. \n\nYour dinner without him doesn't need to be low key just because it's his birthday. That's a ridiculous assumption or demand. \n\nYour allowed to go anywhere you want, regardless if it's someone's birthday. \n\nYou never have to go low-key just because husband gets called into work. \n\nHis birthday celebration will be special no matter when it's celebrated because he's they're. \n\nIf he's upset because it wasn't lowkey then he needs therapy. \n\nAnyone else who says your dinner out should be low key, needs to talk to a therapist because that's a ridiculous expectation. \n\nOne I would never expect from my family and friends.", "He's an AH because he's a doctor who was called into a serious case where a patient died?\n\nHave some empathy, my goodness.", "She is able to entertain her guests without upstaging the actual event they were here for. She chose to not.\n\nAnd as you believe that *trying to save someone's life* is flaking on a friendship; put your money where your mouth is. Show me your Do Not Resuscitate card.", "Did a doctor break up with you :(", "You need help. The fact that you have >100 judgements also shows this sub has problems.", "OP does not state that at all, have a look at the edit", "He got called in despite not being a specialist and not even being on call so it was obviously necessary and it also very obviously was an exception or else OP would haven't put an emphasis on him not being on call even and the casualties being high\n\nYou obviously have never worked in health care or lost a loved one in an accident or else you'd be a bit more grateful to people like OPs husband. You obviously lack perspective of a life that doesn't always revolve around yourself and the person you personally care fore.\n\nYou are the kind of person that fails to see the bigger picture and would always choose themselves first and then wonder why everyone has gotten so selfish and why noone wants to work in healthcare no more.", "The whole world will not end if he doesn\u2019t go to work but people will literally fucking die. You better hope somebody \u201cputs on their superhero cape\u201d if you get in an accident.", "You are absolutely right on all your comments! \n\nShe absolutely did the right thing! They weren\u2019t celebrating his bday anymore. They were just going out instead of staying home (let\u2019s face it, there\u2019s no reason for them to stay home just because husband couldn\u2019t go) and decided to do something that the husband would not enjoy! The next day they went out and celebrated his bday the way he wanted. No reason whatsoever to be unhappy about it! \n\nNTA", "The person you\u2019re responding to isn\u2019t really talking about the money. They\u2019re talking about the pomp and circumstance of the sushi restaurant they went to, and how it was a more notable event than the husband\u2019s birthday. Doing an omakaze dinner can basically be a full blown event in and of itself in a way that going to a steakhouse (for a *birthday*) is not. \n\nIf they had gone to an average (or even very good) sushi restaurant instead of this fancy one, they could have still had a crazy expensive dinner that would not have upstaged the husband\u2019s birthday. This is the point that\u2019s being made.", "I have only brought up the cost to people who have tried to argue that $1k is not a lot to spend on a dinner. If its double the cost of the actually intended party, its a lot.\n\nYou meanwhile, are now strawmanning and attempting to target *me* instead of the argument. Which, you yourself say you understand the argument being made, seems to be deliberate and in bad faith.", "I wasnt giving an opinion on OP\u2019s behaviour or actions, I was just offering a guess at what might be bothering her husband. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s an asshole, man\u2019s doing good work and he had a terrible birthday. He\u2019s healthy to be upset over that, I think anyone in that situation would feel crappy. No, Op didn\u2019t have to stay home or eat fast food with their friends but the three of them should have been far more discreet about how much fun they were having while he was neck deep in dealing with trauma and death. Obviously these friend know what he does for a living. If plans have been made involving flying in to see him for his birthday then suddenly he is called away to work out of the blue then clearly there is some major emergency going on and shit is hitting the fan. They don\u2019t need to ask what happened or sit in the dark doing nothing but they should be sensitive to the fact that his not celebrating with them as planned was not a choice he made, he HAD to go to try and save lives. Even without knowing that he lost a patient, a little sensitivity would have gone a long way. There\u2019s a difference between knowing people went out for a meal or having them rave over how much fun they had on your birthday doing something different while you were handling something which would floor most people. The friends are the biggest AHs here, imo.", "I'm not seeing that. I don't think the money is the issue at all.", ">The price is, I think, just being used as a measure to show the differences in treatment.\n\nI dont understand at all how you came to that conclusion when this what i said. I also didnt \"demonize\" OP nor did I blame her for him finding out. Idk what to tell you maybe you could reread my comment? Before just dropping a load of irrelevant garbage on me?", ">The OP of this comment chain is literally making it about him, and painting him as a petty, selfish grump\n\nI didn't see anything like that.\n\n>He was called in during an emergency to save lives.\n\nWhy does it matter why he couldn't go?

You\u2019re spending too much time on this sub.", "In my defense, you sound just like my brother did at 14!! Lol", "he doesn't want to be upstaged on his birthday.
