We also had friends (a couple) come in from across the country that friday. Initially we were planning to go to a steakhouse for his birthday and as a get together. But unfortunately, he unexpectantly had to work so he couldn\u2019t make it. I asked our friends if they mind a last minute change to a fancy sushi place (all 3 of us love sushi, husband prefers steak, and doesn\u2019t even like raw fish).\n\nAnyways, it was definitely fancy. We did omakase with bunch of a la cart. The total for the 3 of us was over 1k.\n\n We celebrated his bday the next day at that steakhouse.\n\nI didn\u2019t tell him about the switch because I didn\u2019t want him to feel left out. Later he was asking if we were ok with eating steak twice in a weekend. So i had to tell him we had sushi. Unfortunately, our friends were really excited to share about our experience (their first time to omakase). He didn\u2019t say anything more about this but in private, he said I essentially celebrated his bday without him. I asked him what did he want me to do with friends across the country staying with us for just a weekend? Go to mcdonalds? So was I an AH for doing a \u201cmore fancy and expensive\u201d dinner without my husband on the night of his birthday because he couldn\u2019t join?\n\nEdit:\n\nI didn\u2019t tell him bc he was called into a horrible case and his patient died and he wasn\u2019t even on call. But also i didn\u2019t want him to feel left out (despite it was no one\u2019s fault). Felt guilty enjoying life while he was going through the wrenches.  He can\u2019t even tell me exactly why he felt upset. He\u2019s not mad.\n\nTook them to omakase bc they never had it. Fyi, (not that it matters imo), i paid for both dinners from my personal leisure fund.", "created_utc": 1695447575, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16pw853/aita_for_upgrading_dinner_plans_since_my_husband/", "score": 3138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he is honest to himself he knows noone who has a job where they could be called in wants their spouse to sit home in the dark w/o any sort of entertainment to solidarize in suffering with the working spouse, especially not if also friends are there who traveled long for this.\n\nIn my opinion it was even better this way. If you went alonge with the bday plans w/o him, that would have been a little weird, this way you just made sure your guests are not impacted by the impediment his work caused.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t get all the YTA in here at all.

I\u2019ll happily wait for steak and would hope they had a great time.", "Soft YTA. Yes, you could and should have gone to a nice place, but by choosing such an expensive and high-class restaurant you made this dinner the main event of your husband's birthday weekend, and his actual birthday just a \"side dish\".", "NAH. You pivoted when your husband wasn\u2019t available to a restaurant that wasn\u2019t of his preference. They were in town - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s celebrating his birthday without him.", "We often spend that on dinner for 2, it\u2019s not the money, he was feeling left out and sad that he had to work on his birthday. Give him something he would value like extra time with you or what ever he really likes.", "NAH. You celebrated his birthday his way (steakhouse) on the night he was available and when he got called into work you treated his visiting friends to a unique experience that he would not have enjoyed. I get that he's upset that he missed out but that comes with being in the medical field.", "YTA\n\nYou spent over $300/person for a meal that he couldn\u2019t attend on his own birthday. No, you shouldn\u2019t be expected to go to McDonald\u2019s, but there\u2019s a huge gap between a $10 value meal and a $300 dinner. \n\nHe\u2019s right in that you essentially celebrated his birthday without him. And you didn\u2019t tell him because you didn\u2019t want him to feel left out, which pretty much implies that you knew it was an experience that he was missing, not just a meal with friends.", "NAH life happens. His celebration was postponed, he didn't miss it. You can offer him to invite him to sushi next time so he doesn't feel left out. If he wants, of course. \n\nI am sorry for his patient, must be traumatizing and that's a valid excuse why is your husband lashing out. Without the added info my first thought about \"work emergency instead of family celebration\" was affair.", "$1000 is a enormous price for a dinner. I'd be hurt too.\n\nI think YTA; you excluded the guest of honor from the bigger event.

Seems illogical so going with NTA.", "YTA. Why did you keep it from him in the first place? You had an extra extravagant meal without him, on his birthday, I think he is entitled to feel left out. It's not like he chose to bail that evening? Did you have to upgrade the setting? Why not take them out to an equally nice restaurant? Surely he knew you were still going out to eat with them, but I don't know why anyone would assume you were going to do something truly decadent instead of the same plan. Don't you think he felt like his dinner was not as special because of the fact that you went somewhere so crazy the night before?\n\nAnd holy mackerel. What kind of fish costs over 1k? Did you eat Poseidon's pet fish, or an Orca whale?\n\n---\n\n> I didn\u2019t tell him bc he was called into a horrible case and his patient died and he wasn\u2019t even on call.

You also felt guilty the whole time?\n\nWhy do the big fancy night at all then?", "I don't know why people are acting like a middle ground doesn't exist. You still could've had a lovely evening with your friends without dropping 1k.

You made the sushi dinner the main event, rather than his birthday. \n\nHe is probably feeling weird because while you were feasting on ridiculously expensive fish with your friends, he was spending his birthday trying to save someone and it went bad. He is going to be all out of sorts from the stress and disappointment and needs some compassion.", "YTA for acting like you dont know why hes upset. Its not the money, its the being left out and having to hear all about what a fun and great time you all had without him when the great and fun time should have been a celebration of him.", "YTA-it was fine that you switched restaurants without your husband. It\u2019s the scale of the restaurant is a problem. Three of you spent 1K on dinner\u2014that\u2019s a major event\u2014when it was supposed to just be a normal evening with friends so you could celebrate later.

He wasn't there and already aimed you had gone to the dinner anyway. \n\nMy guess is his feelings are less about what you did and more mixed with missing the good time to have to go and have a really shitty time instead but that is not something either of you could control. Hence NAH", "NTA You entertained your guests. What is the issue? I feel like he is carrying over work stress, but you seem to have handled the situation well.", "YTA. Going to such a fancy place without him on his birthday is bad optics. A simpler place or home-cooked meal would be understandable but going all out when he's not able to come feels like kicking him while he's down.", "YTA for so many reasons. Since the birthday boy couldn't be there the dinner should have been low key. Sure have sushi, but at a regular restaurant with normal prices. Plus why didn't you focus on how to make your husband's birthday better when he got home. And the way you handled it made your husband feel left out.", "YTA. Enjoying life despite bad stuff happening isn\u2019t wrong. Otherwise we all would go crazy because messed up stuff happens 24/7. But \u201cenjoying life\u201d (treating yourself and your friends to a fancier dinner than was planned for him) while *your own spouse* had a patient die on *his birthday* does suck. He might not be able to tell you about what upset him right now because he\u2019s dealing with a traumatic experience and his emotions are probably all over the place.", "YTA I'm sorry OP but that's a ridiculous amount for a dinner with just 3 people. Curious to know what 4 at the steakhouse cost?", "YTA, lot of sociopaths in the comments here. Yeesh.", "YTA maybe it's because I'm from a different culture. This, to me, is just so rude, no excuses.\n\nYes, your friends had flown in to spend time with you both. \n\nYou could have made an easy meal such as chilli, garlic bread with a bottle of red for you and your friends, and had a nice low key night at your place catching up. This was after all the point of them coming that weekend, to spend time with you both. That would have then made the birthday dinner the next night the main celebration.  \n\nAs it was, you already had a celebration amongst the 3 of you.\n\nYour husband, on his birthday, had to work, and work an emotionally draining shift. And instead of thinking of your husband, you're more interested in trying out a fancy sushi restaurant to look after them and try it yourself. \n\nWas there even anything for him to eat when he got home? Did you leave him a birthday cupcake in the fridge or do anything thoughtful for him when he got back exhausted? \n\nNothing wrong with going out with friends, but come on, this was such a selfish thing, to do something so amazing excluding your husband and especially so on his birthday! \n\n No wonder he's become unable to relate his feelings to you.", "NTA. He couldn\u2019t come so you did something he doesn\u2019t enjoy that you and your guests really do and did.  Still doing the steakhouse dinner with him, on a night he can attend. All good.", "YTA.

Your husband does not even like sushi. \n\nUnfortunately, your husband's work situation got in the way.

I think it was fine to go out with your friends and have a really nice fun meal. \n\nI also get that your husband feels left out since he got called into work. And he lost a patient. It\u2019s a no win situation. I think kindness is key here. \n\nTell him you wished he was there but you are also allowed to enjoy your friends too. Ask a bunch of questions if he often feels left out or what\u2019s at the bottom of it. And let him know that it upsets you that he\u2019s making you feel bad when you\u2019re allowed a fancy night out without judgement.", "NTA your husband is being selfish.

The fact that you didn\u2019t tell him as part of an everyday conversation, I think you know that.", "YTA - you lied by omission.

The change of venue is a real win-win since the remaining guests like sushi while the guest of honor likes steak. So they had his birthday steak dinner on another night when he was available.

What sort of partner would not just cancel and re-arrange plans if the person those plans where for could not make it?", "Though I dont think money is the issue it seems that you celebrated your friends and made your husband an afterthought.

So I think he feels like his birthday became secondary - which isn't the end of the world - but he was probably really happy that his friends came to town from across the country to spend it with him - and now his birthday is secondary to it all. \n\nIt's one of those things that isn't rational but just takes the shine off something you were really excited/ happy/honoured about. \n\nI'm not saying you should have done something boring or cheap, but you basically picked something that was a level-up from what they were coming for.", "NAH you need to sit down and have a good long honest talk with each other when emotions aren't so high.", "I believe NAH, really.\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong. In fact, what were you supposed to do? Not entertain the guests? Eat steak twice in a row? And what you picked was something your husband would not have ever enjoyed? And you celebrated his birthday the next day - WITH the steak dinner that he was looking forward to.\n\nSo, your husband is upset even though the logic doesn't quite support him. He actually did think you had stuck to the plan and had eaten steak two days in a row. But you've noted how (1) emotionally draining and traumatic his birthday night was and (2) how personally disappointing it was for him. He absolutely deserves a little time to be more emotional than logical. And deserves some understanding and support for having to process all those emotions. I think that would go a long way toward getting you both to a good place about this.\n\nSome are saying that you shouldn't have had such a great dinner, a more toned-down dinner would have been better. I do imagine that the specialness of that particular dinner probably is adding to his feeling of disappointment that this great dinner happened on his birthday without him. (Even though it would not have been a great dinner to him). Again, sympathy, understanding and support for what he's feeling is in order. But I also would offer in your defense that\n\n1. It was fortuitous those friends were there with you on a night when he had to work. It allowed all three of you to enjoy and share something that only you three wanted to do. When would you have ever had that meal with your husband?\n2. You are a doctor's spouse. I imagine you have had your share of evenings and outings canceled because of his job. You deal with it because he's your husband and he signed up for that when he chose his career. To me, that's all the more reason you should get to enjoy a special night when you could create one from the ashes of your original plans.\n3. That's where, after your husband has had a chance to process his emotions, I hope he gives you the grace and support and understanding to be happy for you that you did get to have a special evening with those friends.\n\nIn my romantic little heart, I'd like to envision this mutual grace leading to you both feeling even closer to each other and deciding to go out again. For another special dinner - something romantic for just the two of you :)", "NTA\u2026you did not celebrate his birthday without him.  You celebrated seeing friends who came to visit you for one weekend, from out of the country.  Yes, they were excited, but not about his birthday, but that they got to try something new.  Your husband has a job where he might get called away at last minute.  Your life does not stop because of that.    If you were truly celebrating his birthday, you would have went to the steakhouse, instead you went to a place you knew you would not have gone otherwise because he does not like that food.", "NTA\n\nBut something isn't right here though. He got called in on a day off, Hospitals have on call surgeons and he wasn't on call. What was he really doing that he couldn't say no to knowing, you already had plans for the evening for his birthday? This shows a lack of respect at the very least!\n\nI would have done the same, hey I like a good steak as much as the next Guy, but a chance for some fancy food at another place is to good to pass up.\n\nAnd in any case he got his steak the next night.", "OP., The \u201ckeep it from him\u201d about where you went, is bullshit\u2026 you and every other readers knows it! I don\u2019t think he would have been upset that you went for sushi instead since he doesn\u2019t like it, but to go to overboard on his birthday without him, was an asshole move and you know it! (Hence) \u201cI kept it from him\u201d and the visitors were the ones that let him know! (Not even his wife-WTF) Lady you sound like a very manipulative person.

What you did was wrong. YTA! X10\u2026 you are not fooling anyone but yourself!", "YTA this is just another case of rich people being out of touch and not having the foresight to see how their actions might impact others.

Definitely could have made a more tactful choice.", "NTA\n\nThe first outing was not a birthday celebration; looks like money isn't an issue; did something you wouldn't have been able to do if your partner was there cos it didn't cater to his tastes.

It makes sense that you would do the sushi place, the preference of both you and your guests, when he was unavailable. \n\nHis friends flew all the way across the country to see him, but he was unable to go out that night. It makes sense that you took them out for a treat.", "NTA  - I guess I'm a minority here.  I think if he got upset you switched dinner choices that's on him. It makes sense to eat something that he wouldn't be a fan of with others who like that food while visiting for a while. I don't understand why he thinks you celebrated his birthday without him - did he expect you all just to leave? Plus if he doesn't like sushi - you probably wouldnt get a chance to do this restaurant anyways with him - it's not something he'd enjoy or like. I think... his feeling may be hurt especially after a tough day at work that you went to a nice restaurant without him on his birthday- even if it isn't a place hed like.

So what was the steak dinner with him? Not celebrating his birthday?", "I bet she kept it from him because its on a credit card that he pays.", "NTA - he\u2019s petty and jealous. What matters is that his birthday was celebrated properly. There was zero point to stick to old plans of doing steakhouse when your husband couldn\u2019t attend, so it made more sense changing plans to what you and guests enjoyed. Your husband like you said dislikes raw fish so he\u2019s petty to even feel negative about you guys won\u2019t sticking out to the original plan.

Choosing what the guests and you like seems way more practical than to sticking out and having steak twice. \n\nWhatever stress he had at work, he\u2019s taking it out on you and that\u2019s a bad sign.

We also had friends (a couple) come in from across the country that friday. Initially we were planning to go to a steakhouse for his birthday and as a get together. But unfortunately, he unexpectantly had to work so he couldn\u2019t make it. I asked our friends if they mind a last minute change to a fancy sushi place (all 3 of us love sushi, husband prefers steak, and doesn\u2019t even like raw fish).\n\nAnyways, it was definitely fancy. We did omakase with bunch of a la cart. The total for the 3 of us was over 1k.\n\n We celebrated his bday the next day at that steakhouse.\n\nI didn\u2019t tell him about the switch because I didn\u2019t want him to feel left out. Later he was asking if we were ok with eating steak twice in a weekend. So i had to tell him we had sushi. Unfortunately, our friends were really excited to share about our experience (their first time to omakase). He didn\u2019t say anything more about this but in private, he said I essentially celebrated his bday without him. I asked him what did he want me to do with friends across the country staying with us for just a weekend? Go to mcdonalds? So was I an AH for doing a \u201cmore fancy and expensive\u201d dinner without my husband on the night of his birthday because he couldn\u2019t join?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", " Maybe he\u2019s upset as it sounds you 3 had more fun trying Omakase -  then his birthday dinner and feels left out. Unfortunately can\u2019t be helped but I\u2019d treat him to fun night out", "He wouldn't have felt left out if you had steak without him? He would rather you do HIS dinner choice without him and then go it again with him? \nI don't get it", "Even if you have a lot of money, a thousand bucks is a lot of money for dinner. I would agree with your husband.", "This is a complex one. I have a feeling it\u2019s tied, at least in part, to the case he was called in on. \n\nIt\u2019s a jarring juxtaposition to realize that while he was called in on his birthday (when he was not on call \u2014 that\u2019s how bad it was) and fighting either to keep a patient alive or having to rehash his actions to his superiors, you were out with mutual friends enjoying $1K of dinner. Celebrating being together. It\u2019s a lot of cognitive dissonance to process. \n\nBecause this is such a specific instance, I\u2019m gonna go with NAH. You didn\u2019t mean anything by it, and he\u2019s probably trying to not be offended. \n\nMake sure he gets the mental health support that\u2019s available. There\u2019s definitely a cultural \u201cpush through it\u201d thing he\u2019s battling, and that helps no one.", "Nta", "So you celebrated his birthday while he was at work. NAH u had to entertain the quest. If u went to McDonald's you could gotten hubby a Happy Meal with a prize in it. Lol.", "NTA. You celebrated with him the next day, the night he wasn\u2019t present was just a dinner with friends. It\u2019s understandable he feeling left out and a little upset he couldn\u2019t go, but would be selfish of him to expect you to cancel everything.", "NAH. Him being bummed is valid, you wanting to still provide your friends with a good dinner and getting to enjoy something your husband wouldn't want seems fine IMO. I don't like all the same food as my husband (or atleast far less frequently), so we both take opportunities here and there to get the things we enjoy without the other. I think it being his birthday may a factor, but you guys shouldn't be blamed for enjoying life while he answered a work call in. He can't expect you to stay on hold for his job. If you'd gone to his favorite place, I could see him having a stronger argument.", "I didn\u2019t tell him because i felt bad he had to work on his bday while i treated our friends to their first omakase. I also would probably not bring him to something like that bc he doesn\u2019t like raw fish and you can modify omakase. It just felt weird. \n\nI guess i didn\u2019t want him to know or feel bad we had fun while he had to work a horrible shift but i also didn\u2019t want our friends to waste a weekend.  They did fly out here for his birthday and to visit us. \n\nI found out the next morning he lost a patient so even more reason to not talk about it.", "Agree with NAH. I'm surprised at the number of Y T A responses. What was she supposed to do with her guests, just sit at home because the husband had to work?? As long as there's not an issue with spending that amount of money, which it doesn't sound like there is, I don't see the problem. Plus, it does not sound like she knew that the patient had died until the next day. I'm sure husband was bummed he had to work, and even more so that it was a sad/difficult night, but I think wife was well within her rights to still take her friends out to dinner, considering they had flown into town to visit them.", "100% agree NAH. \n\nHe doesn't like sushi and OP doesn't care for steak, so going when he was unavailable was the perfect scenario. Naturally, as said above, this is assuming that the cost wasn't highly unusual. I would also understand not telling him right off because he was likely upset about his patient.\n\nI also understand him being upset about missing the evening and his birthday with his friends.", "Same here! I don't get it either. She didn't know his patient was dying at the time she took them out. She took them to a place his friends, who traveled across the country, would enjoy. If they can afford it, the price is irrelevant. Also, the husband picked the place he wanted! \n\nShe says she didn't want to brag about the place when she found out what happened. It's not like she would have hidden what they did had his night turned out differently. I would have wanted my friends to have a good time also.", "Completely agree here. He doesn\u2019t like sushi and they went to the exact steakhouse the next day! Adults need to grow up about their birthdays\u2026 he was (unfortunately) unavailable the day of his birthday so they did something he doesn\u2019t like. Since they did this they kept the original birthday plans special for his birthday.", "Ah maybe this.\n\nHe isn\u2019t the best with his own feelings so he wasn\u2019t even able to tell me why he was bothered and felt upset.", "That's exactly right. He's hurt because on the night he was called into work to attend to a horrific case, his wife had a massive blow out dinner without him.", "I also didn\u2019t twll him bc he went in on his birthday due to mass casualty. He\u2019s not even a trauma surgeon. He was just one of the few who could go in despite not being on call.\n\nAnd his patient died - so i didn\u2019t want to be like \u201clook at all thw cool things we did! While you slaved away trying to save someone and they still died\u201d", "lol what? OP entertained hubby\u2019s guests while he was callled into work and they celebrated his birthday the following day. dinner with the friends wasn\u2019t a birthday event. it was just dinner.", "He wasn\u2019t the guest of honor though. He had to back out of the dinner unexpectedly due to work, at that point it was no longer a birthday celebration, it was just three friends getting dinner. \n\nHe still got the birthday dinner he wanted at the steakhouse he wanted. Expecting people to not have a good time because you\u2019re not there is incredibly selfish, and it\u2019s especially selfish when you\u2019re the one who backed out.", "What\u2019s expensive is relative. He\u2019s a surgeon, so I doubt the money is the part that is bothering him. \n\nAs the spouse of a doctor, you become accustomed to them missing events or holidays. You can\u2019t let it bring you down or stop you from experiencing life. She\u2019s kinda right. He doesn\u2019t like fish, they probably wouldn\u2019t want steak two nights in a row, and she was entertaining her guests. He\u2019s probably mostly stressed about how emotionally and physically taxing his career is, and is misdirecting that frustration..", "Just because $1000 is expensive to many it is still relative, they obviously have the funds for doing this, this isn't about the price.", "He doesn't even like raw fish. He is not jealous of the sushi, he just thinks they should have not had fun without him which is not a fair expectation when some people have crossed the country to hang out with you. Were they supposed to sit at home and starve?", "OP had omakase. That\u2019s a very normal price to pay for the experience. OP is NTA for creating their guests to something they all enjoy.", "He wasn't excluded. He couldn't come. \n\nThe friends are there for a limited time.\n\nThey would not have gone there, as he doesn't like sushi. \n\nI get maybe he has some FOMO, but I hate a specific cuisine and I'm not gonna judge my husband for seeking it out when his brother visits or something. He still got his birthday dinner.", "Why does the price matter when he doesn't even eat sushi?", "They are food he wouldn't even like!! How is that excluding him?! They did the thing he wanted to do when he was available. It wasn't his fault he couldn't make it, but like... they can have fun and eat too!", "No it\u2019s not for a really nice dinner. The guests were from across country. Bday boy cancelled and still got his dinner.", "Money is relative sweetheart. $1k to the wealthy is a drop in the bucket. NTA to OP", "OP was COVERING for her husband, who was an AH to his guests.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd \"enormous price\" depends on your level of income.", "Him asking if she was cool eating steak two days in a row kinda shows that his head is wrapped up in the patient because that is a pretty bizarre thing to assume.\n\nI\u2019m going with NAH but being mindful of upstaging the birthday dinner is a consideration that I don\u2019t think was at the front of her mind. I doubt the husband is really that petty about it. It\u2019s the mix of death and missing out that actually bothering him.\n\nNo one wants to lose a patient on their birthday.\n\nThere\u2019s no way that he really wants her and the guest from out of town to put their lives on hold because he has a high stress job. It comes with the territory. He\u2019s just having a hard time dealing with the stress.", "Don't agree at all. You can also get up to $1000 at certain steakhouses and high end sushi is not always more expensive. The price shows it was a fancier experience and therefore, made his actual birthday celebration the side gig. Oh, and obvious YTA.", "Used to commercial fish. Had to work in a Japanese market during covid. Based on the store price, one damn clam would come out to about two grand, which is insane as we only got about 4 bucks a pound. Big clams though.", "It was probably the Holy Mackerel that was so expensive, yeah.", "My friends never had omakase. And my husband doesn\u2019t like raw fish. So i thought this is s chance for me to treat them to omakase. Which alone is like 200$ per person. Each piece from a la cart is like 15+. Then tax and tips brought us to 1k ish.\n\nI let him pick his favorite steak house because i am not a huge fan of steak so i wouldn\u2019t know what was good. Idk the diff between ribeye and nystrip.", "I do wonder how Orca tastes now", "The husband was left out BY HIS DOING. That's on HIM. HE did this.", "Same. This is where I'm at too. On one hand, having such an extravagant dinner is crazy but I know sushi is expensive and going when he isn't available is probably the most ideal time. On the other hand, keeping it from him was a bad decision. He probably is sad he missed out on the birthday plans. I would be too. But also I understand that comes with anything in the medical field. I'm so torn.", "You don\u2019t know who these people and and their lifestyle.", "Not even a chain restaurant, but maybe a normal sushi place?", "Why? This other couple flew or drove across the country to have fun with OP and her husband.

Instead you had the main event without him, that's not loving, that's not kind, you get a birthday once a year. I'm sure your husband was looking forward to the evening just like the three of you were, he did the respectful thing by his job and that's understandable that the three of you were still going to go out to eat. The fact that you had the nicer main event without him is the issue, that is what is unloving here.\n\nI feel sorry for your husband, if you can't see this on your own and can't see this with feedback in Reddit, maybe you don't love your husband as much as he deserves.\n\n Just own it. You made a mistake.

I don't ever want you to feel as if you are not anything more than my main event.\n\nSheesh, whatever happened to really loving and adoring your spouse? I've made mistakes, many of us have, what I always do whether I agree with my husband feeling left out or not is I make sure that he knows how much I love him and how much I would never deliberately do anything to hurt him. Sometimes you just have to say the decision made in the moment in hindsight wasn't the best decision and I'm sorry.

Exactly what I was thinking. Did he expect them to just go out and have fast food to make him feel more special?", "Fyi, there are more affordable omakase too. Nyc has some for 80-120$ per person. But each a la cart (aka one piece) is usually 10-15$ up to 32$ for one bite)", "We went through residency. This is how we handle it. He prefers to not talk about it. If he has a rough night, he\u2019ll snuggle with me in bed.  No words needed. We\u2019ve done this dozens of times. I learned to not ask until he\u2019s ready.", "It\u2019s not about the actual money bc he would see it on the CC statement anyways. Just felt wrong to be like \u201ci took our friends to their first omakase ever! Sorry ur patient died\u201d", "He\u2019s a grown adult surgeon. He\u2019s not a 5 year old.\n\nBirthdays are not and should not be a huge deal to well adjusted adults. Seeing close friends for the first time in four years IS a huge deal \n\nShe treated friends who had flown across the country to an experience while he had to miss plans due to work. She handled this well", "No, the money is not an issue. You aren't understanding how money is not the issue, because you clearly can't let go of some money = love concept.

He didn\u2019t lash out in anger. In private, he tried to express that he felt left out. Saying \u201cwhat do you want us to do? Go to McDonald\u2019s?\u201d Is dismissive of his feelings of being left out. \n\n\nWith all due respect, comments like yours encourage men NOT to try and open up. Because this guy actually tried to communicate a feeling that was obvious to every party here and he isn\u2019t really being met with kindness.

He wanted to go to the steak house. I think you're right, it doesn't sound like money is an issue for this couple.", "I was just correcting the comment i replied to who said it had nothing to do with price when op had stated it, according to the husband, was in part due to price. There was no opinion given on who or what they should or shouldn't do so not sure what you're arguing here.\n\nOpinion time: I agree she shouldn't feel limited in what she did with the friends. Tbh, if they had gone for steak, that would have been a bit sucky as that was the husbands specific birthday treat and so they did something else. The husband is being petty here, he should appreciate they chose something he wouldn't have enjoyed.", "She said he wouldn\u2019t be interested in the sushi restaurant, but then she says she didn\u2019t tell him they went because she didn\u2019t want him to feel left out. But he assumed they still went out for steak, so if he was going to feel left out knowing they switched to sushi, it would be because he actually was interested in the restaurant. This makes me think OP recognized that her husband might actually be interested in this sushi restaurant.", "Why is everyone saying that the sushi place dinner was the \"bigger event\"? Just because it cost more? It wasn't his birthday celebration. They celebrated with him where HE wanted to go the next day. So what's the problem? He doesn't like sushi anyway.", "Was it \"special\" because it cost more? He doesn't like sushi so what's the big deal here?", "I appreciate the sentiment in your response but the cost of me travelling to the closest place where omakase would be available would eclipse the cost of the more affordable options. If im going to have it, might as well go for the best stuff! I'm also a long way away from NYC. On the bright side, I've got lots of time to save up for my platinum bucketlist experiences. Wish me luck! \ud83d\ude03", "Why was it okay in your husband's mind to take them to a steakhouse on his birthday (\"Hope you don't mind steak two days in a row\") but not sushi? How controlling is this man, that he'll allow a steakhouse without him but not sushi, which he doesn't eat? This is his upset over losing a patient, having a shitty night on his birthday, then having to listen to the guests crow about what a great time they had without him. It's probably easier to be upset about that than to deal with the actual horror he went through. I can understand this, but it's not rational.", "You can't spell \u00e0 la carte?", "He got his birthday dinner but OP's friends were still talking about their experience at the more expensive, fancier sushi restaurant. It's like, \"here's the thing you wanted, happy now? But anyway, remember when the chef at the sushi place...\"\n\nCoupled with the bad night that he had, I would understand him being upset. He doesn't like sushi, but would you feel celebrated if your guests are still talking about the experience they had when you weren't there during your birthday dinner?", "You're not understand how it could be and probably is. I own multiple companies and have zero issues with money and having it. I just know how it affects people . And clearly, her husband is affected.", "I guarantee if OP was a man and he took his friends to a fancier dinner on his surgeon wife\u2019s birthday, this wouldn\u2019t even be up for debate.

If I was in the same situation I wouldn't go out of my way to give details of my fun dinner my husband was supposed  to go to when he was called into emergency surgery...even if it was the steak place.", "It was \"the bigger event\" because the friends were so excited and gushing. That's what he's upset about. It isn't the price tag. It is that the sushi experience is the friends, \"highlight of the visit.\" \n\nIt also doesn't help that while everyone was having the time of their life, he was miserable on his birthday. It's the nature of the job, and he knows this. It just hits a little harder on your birthday when friends are visiting.", "Exactly. They took the opportunity to go somewhere he *wouldn't want to go to* because he couldn't make it. Everyone's getting caught up on the cost - but for a lot of people 1k for dinner isn't a big deal. Let's say the sushi was $200 verses $100 for steak - It'd be the same issue. He could have chosen a more expensive option, but he wanted the steak.", "Even the OP said it was fancier/better/etc", "I mean fancy restaurants are special events for many people, especially when it's the first time ever that they had a specific food. If he is rich, then it's most likely the cost that bothers him.", "Good luck saving! You can find affordable omakase outside of NYC as well. It might be fun to start researching options. You can also find a similar concept at non-sushi places where it's called a tasting menu. Usually $100 and up. \n\nI did omakase once as part of a splurge trip to Philadelphia. I skipped alcoholic beverages to make it less expensive. I've also done maybe two tasting menus. I did one with wine pairings which was delightful but also skippable.", "I don't expect to be the sole focus of all conversation at my birthday dinner, no. Especially if my guests were people I don't get to see or spend time with very often, like friends from out of town. It's my birthday so I get to choose the restaurant and/or outing, but I'm a grown adult so the whole conversation doesn't have to be about me. \n\nHusband sounds like he's upset about losing the patient and the unexpected upheaval of his evening, and is projecting that on his wife and guests. They chose to do an activity he would not have enjoyed and didn't want to be there for, on an evening when he was not available to join them. They're in from out of town, which is in and of itself a special occasion to celebrate. I get feeling sad for missing out, but taking it out on OP and their guests is misplaced and inappropriate. \n\nSure, OP could have chosen just run-of-the-mill sushi, but their friends were in. Husband wouldn't have wanted to do the expensive sushi experience with OP at another time, these friends did. They won't get another chance anytime soon. His birthday dinner was postponed til he could join them. They did an activity that he didn't want to do. OP us NTA.", "That the friends are being the biggest AHs here is probanly true. They could have stayed at we had nice sushe but they didn't although they knew the circumstances. Imo OP didn't to anything wrong thoigh and definitely isn't an AH for going to a restaurant with their friends OP knew husband wouldn't like anyways. The only thing that would make OP an AH is inviting these friends to the sushi restaurant knowing very well that they would go on and on about it making husband feel bad. But then they'd be friends with obvious AH ms and that would be questionable in general - I mesn who would purpousfully invite AHs across the country?", "Yeah, maybe.

I just hit enter twice to create a space between sentences to create space between thoughts and it's not one long runon sentence.", "I\u2019d say the same thing in reverse. OP\u2019s husband is sad he missed out on a good time, and that\u2019s understandable. It doesn\u2019t mean OP and her guests shouldn\u2019t have had a good time. If the situation were the wife missing out on a dinner for unavoidable reasons, as long as they didn\u2019t go to her favorite place without her I think it\u2019s ultimately not a slam.", "I think this is the case but it's not his wife's fault. I think it's just misplaced anger and disappointment which is understandable. If he's reasonable he'll realize this and come around.", "Define \u201ca lot of people\u201d.", "What kind of people do you hang out with that think spending a thousand bucks on dinner isn't a big deal?", "No, $1k for a single dinner is an insane amount of money to spend, must be nice to be so rich that you think the rest of us can remotely make close to enough money to be wasting it on a single meal like that. A lot of people, as in 99% of the population, are likely to never even have a meal going over 250$ in their lives, especially outside of a major event like a wedding.", "She paid for both dinners, not him.", "Didn't think there'd be a restaurant offering omakase in my country but I've been proven wrong! The different menus range from $100-$240. I've got this place in my sights. Now all that's left to do is save up for the experience. Unfortunately, they don't include drinks with the meal but alcoholic beverages aren't as expensive here as I hear people from other countries quote so that won't be much of a worry. I'll factor everything in when the time comes.", "I don't think he wanted to be the focus of the conversation. But according to OP, her friends were still gushing about it. Maybe they could have talked about something else? \n\nAnd OP's husband said nothing but only talked to her privately afterwards. I think it's NAH, because while there's nothing wrong with going to an expensive restaurant with her friends, knowing the next day what her husband went through, she should have told her friends to not talk about it. Since OP said herself she didn't want to rub in his face. She didn't, her friends did. Essentially making husband feel like they celebrated without him.", "Well if you\u2019re talking family I\u2019d say that happens quite a bit but hopefully these friends were just overexcited and being oblivious rather than total assholes, especially since they\u2019ve had hundreds of dollars worth of food out of OP and her husband! \n\n\nGotta say, I love sushi but good quality steak awesomeness wins every time for me.", "I think the point is that the way you've typed your reply is effectively isolating each sentence in its own paragraph, rather than grouping related sentences together in paragraphs.", "It\u2019s not that they\u2019re having a good time without you, it\u2019s that they\u2019re having a better time without you.

Hope your case goes well, we all sympathize and wish you the best!\"  \nGoing to omakase behind husband's back -> exclusion vibes.  \nGoing to omakase after leaving sympathetic text message -> inclusion vibes.\n* Communicate your worries to the friends, try to get them to focus more on his birthday celebration than the omakase.

Yes you can find sushi rolls in 7-11 but when you go to a fancy restaurant you don't go and get the chicken nuggets.\n\nSushi is more than rolls, once you get into their other menus like Sashimi, Nigiri or order off the standard American palate menu and you start getting eel, squid, sea urchin the prices go up, these are not California avocado roll prices.\n\nAlso, OP stated that they went with the Omakase, that is like a 12 course chef experience where you dont order anything, the chef will curate your entire meal for you and you just accept what they make in front of you. they did this for their entire party. this is expensive.\n\nAlso Remember that sushi is finger food, It takes A LOT of Sushi to get full.\n\n2 people can easily rack up $400 - $500 bucks depending on the items you get, or you can spend $50 - $100 bucks on the tried and true sushi roll.\n\nOP said the friends have never been so its safe to say they went in tried a lot of the more expensive items.\n\nFunny story about the \"2 people can spend $400 - $500\" that was me and my friend. We went to a hole in the wall sushi spot. no one spoke English and the menus were all in Japanese. we ordered mostly sashimi and the weirdest fish/animals they had (cause we wanted to try some weird things) there was one dish where the chef cut up a live prawn, deshelled and deveined it put a little sauce on it. put it in a plate, then grabbed the chopped up head and stood it up and then served it to a group of college girls and they all screamed at it because the prawn head was still moving.\n\nSushi is an experience boyo and you better be prepared if you want to try the non-sushi roll menu. It's gonna cost ya."]}
