Defensive driving courses are often asked for as punishment for drivers who behave recklessly, but in my experience don't change peoples driving behavior unless they decide to bring those habits with them every time they drive. Meaning they do have a purpose, but so frequently people ignore the material or quickly revert back to bad habits as if the course/accident never happened. You need to sit down with your adult child and explain to her exactly how much you have spent out of pocket and with insurance on cars for her, I recommend asking your insurance company for statements of everything paid out in those claims for visuals, and set up a plan with your child to start taking over paying for her own car, insurance, and maintenance. I just want to be clear you aren't asking her to pay anything for her accidents just take the time to look at how financially this has effected your family, in a way that doesn't allow her to debate or shift negligence as you have tried to do multipletimes in on other comments. Have a conversation about how you have felt about her accidents (ie. I felt scared when you almost died at 16 or I feel frustrated you don't seem to understand the seriousness of the situation), talk to her about things you've had to miss out on because of paying for these accidents, and talk to your child about how dangerous car accidents can be even if she has been okay in these. It only takes a couple seconds of not paying attention or driving too fast to end your daughters or someone else's life period. And the ultimate truth of it OP is that your child is responsible for her actions 100% of the time she is driving a vehicle and you have been heavily shielding her from that responsibility with your words and actions about her accidents.

Alot of people don't know that you can negotiate your cars value with your insurance adjuster esp. if the similar cars are going for much more in the area, you do not need to settle for the lower amount. use sites like kbb and auto tempest to find the \"book value\" and asking prices for similar cars in your local area.

Second she has a clear history of being an unsafe driver. I say you should take her car and not buy her a new one. She has shown she doesn't take of them properly so she doesn't get another free one, and hers is gone because she took her brother's.  It's the same thing you would do if a young kid stole their siblings toy and broke it.\n\nAnother reason why I seriously think you should not get her another car is that she's not learning from her mistakes there are no consequences.  I have a sister who is very much like your daughter, there was a point when she'd had her license for 8 years and in that time totaled 8 cars. Yeah legally 2 or 3 weren't her fault but having driven with her I honestly think she did play a big part in that. There have been time while driving with her that I've literally had to grab the wheel to keep us on the road cause she'll be too busy fixing her makeup or something. I also grew up in a very rural area where the main things to look out for were deer and ice and she still managed to get in accidents (literally got stuck in our driveway because she was backing out and went off the side which a steep 2-3ft slope she got stuck on).\n\nTo sum it up my mother always was way too soft on her after these incidents with helping her get new cars and such and my sister really didn't change. While her totaled car to years driving ratio has gone down as she's gotten older she is still a reckless driver who I would never allow to drive my car.  Reckless driving is dangerous to both her and everyone around her while she's driving. I remember being 16 in the car with my sister driving and her 2 young kids in the back being so nervous and having to grab the door handle and pumping that imaginary brake pedal on the passenger side cause she'd be texting, doing makeup, scolding her kids, or whatever like driving wasn't even one of the top 5 priorities on her mind.  And to make me feel nervous as a passenger is a feat in itself as I grew up with my dad who is a crazy driver, not really reckless, just crazy.\n\nJust please don't giver a new car, make her get her own and be solely responsible for it and encourage her to take a refresher driving course or something.\n\nSorry for the long rant, I just had to say something", "Of course I wouldn't.
