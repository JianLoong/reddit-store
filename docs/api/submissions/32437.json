MIL said she\u2019s hurt and confused by Lily\u2019s behaviour and doesn\u2019t understand why she\u2019s pulling away from her the most. She then list lists (untrue) things about herself to explain why she\u2019s shocked Lily\u2019s cutting them off. MIL would say things like \u201cI\u2019m a great listener\u201d then stare at us all until we agreed. She called herself a nice person and I couldn\u2019t hold in my laughter. I wasn\u2019t the only one who laughed by the way, my sister in law laughed too. MIL wasn\u2019t expecting this and she asked me why I laughed. I told her the truth, she\u2019s not a nice person. She asked me what she\u2019d done to me that had made me think she wasn\u2019t. \n\nI drank some juice and began listing the things she has done and said to and about me that weren\u2019t nice. She kept saying I never did or said that or saying she apologised and I need to let it go, so I decided to bring up the elephant in the room. Her using her influence over my husband\u2019s job and threatening to sell our house to force us into spending the holidays doing what she wants. \n\nWe left after she started weeping and throwing herself on the floor. She told me I owed her a public apology because I embarrassed her in front of the family. I refused to apologise. Since then I\u2019ve received some messages telling me I did the right thing and many telling me I\u2019m a huge AH for talking to her like that and need to apologise. So am I the AITA? \n\nFor context:\nMIL has us spend the holidays creating curated images and videos for her to show off to her awful friends she competes with. During the trip professional photographers and videographers are present from sunrise to sunset. Every single day. It\u2019s like we\u2019re models for British Vogue the way we\u2019re constantly posing for photos, we can\u2019t even eat until the photographers say the shot is perfect. We aren\u2019t even allowed to do our own thing for a few hours, we have stick to the event planner\u2019s schedule. We\u2019re constantly being filmed like on a reality TV show. It\u2019s exhausting. I\u2019m currently pregnant with twins so I don\u2019t have the energy for this family trip. I spoke to my husband and he said he hasn\u2019t wanted to go since he was 12. He explained to MIL that we wouldn\u2019t be attending this year but we\u2019d attend her New Year\u2019s events and party. Yes. Events. She cried and said she felt like I stole him from her and I\u2019ve graduated from using sex to manipulate him to using our babies. He stood up for me and she said fine don\u2019t come. \n\nMIL is on the deed of our house since it was a wedding present. She had our estate agent inform us our house has 3 potential buyers interested. Our house isn\u2019t for sale\u2026She then went on to use my husband\u2019s job as leverage which did the trick. My husband works for his family\u2019s company as do most of the men in his family. MIL had father in law subtly tell us to come or get fired. So now we\u2019re coming on the trip\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I think the talk to have with your husband is what kind of example do you want to set for your kids? To appease a malignant narcissist who knowingly ties themself to your home life?

Dear Lord, professional photographers from sunup to sundown? I've never heard of such narcissistic heights as your MIL has achieved! She's the Mt. Everest of selfish, petty, mean, rotten behavior.\n\nWhen such a person asks a stupid question such as, \"What have I done to make you think I'm not a nice person?\" all she expected was validation.  It's a reflection of one of the wildest aspects to a bully's character: They frequently live in a fish bowl and believe their own lies.\n\nIt's crazy that somebody who is SO VERY devious and conniving can't put any of that cunning to work for any other person's benefit.
