We share custody of our 13 year old daughter. He got married and has a 5 year old daughter with his now wife.\n\n\nHis daughter would spend time with my daughter regularly. They adore each other but she doesn't come to my house and they rarely meet up there.\n\n\nHis wife has been diagnosed with cancer and has started treatment recently. The other day he came to drop our daughter off and asked to speak to me. He talked about his wife's circumstances then how his family won't be able to have a christmas celebration this year. He said it wasn't fair for his daughter and asked if I could \"include\" her in my family's celebration. He pointed out how the girls will have a great time together bonding and making memories, but I said I was sorry but my family's traditional celebration is a sacred thing and I do not feel comfortable including anyone else. Plus it'd be awkward having her in my home. He said that his daughter may not be family to me but she sure is to her halfsister. He asked me to stop and \"think\" about what's best for the kids here. I suggested he take his daughter to spend christmas with her grandparents (he said his parents and him are NC) and tried to cut the conversation short but he stopped me and started going on about how cruel it was for me to decline to include his daughter who's already having a hard time adjusting. I saw that he was beginning to cry so I stepped back and said I was no longer feeling comfortable having this conversation. I asked him to leave and he did but still texted me asking me to agree to let his daughter come spend christmas even offered that he stays away if that'll make me less uncomfortable, I said no and now he's calling me selfish and unfeeling.\n\n\n*A point worth mentioning here and that is my family are going to attend and they said that they too will not feel comfortable in this situation thus I said it'd be awkward.*", "created_utc": 1668514181, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvvc84/aita_for_not_allowing_my_daughters_half_sister_to/", "score": 539, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What is ex planning if he wants to dump his kid on you?", "I\u2019m wondering what is going on here for there to be such harsh feelings about this child spending Christmas with her sibling and family. Did you guys get a divorce because of the woman he is married to now? Or was the divorce just sprung on you and now there is bitterness towards ex husband. Please help us understand because right now you are coming out as YTA", "Nta", "YTA", "NTA", "YTA. I know you don\u2019t owe him anything but I am sorry you have no compassion for this innocent child who is losing her mother. This is heartbreaking. She is your child\u2019s family.", "It would be a really nice thing for you to have half-sister over for Christmas, and would barely be any extra hassle. I have a half-brother (who is emotionally the same as a brother to me) and I'm really pleased that my late dad found the time to be nice to him and to occasionally take him out with me and my full-brother. No matter how much he disliked my half-brother's parents.\n\nI dunno, it just means a lot to me that my dad liked my half-brother. Also my half-bro (weird calling him that) really helped me out a week ago. so in 5 or 20 years' time your daughter might lean really heavily on her half-sister, they might help each-other out in ways you'd be eternally grateful for. So yknow, be nice.\n\nReddit's going to tell you you're NTA and I am aware of that. Ignore the votes and make an extra plate for a needy almost-family-member this Christmas.", "NTA. That's a big ask by him and it's not your responsibility to spend yours christmas minding someone else's (your ex!) child if you don't want too.", "YTA for refusing to see the larger picture here.. a child's emotional well being. You didn't even ask your daughter if she would want that.", "YTA 1000% Geez!  YTA.", "Technically NTA\nBut man her mum has cancer, she is 5 she doesn\u2019t understand why her mum is sick.

He should not assume that you are willing to carry any of his baggage. It\u2019s rough to be with someone with cancer, I get it. But maybe he should consider letting his young daughter spend Christmas with her mother before she can\u2019t anymore. \nOP: have at least a little compassion for the situation. What would you do if you had cancer and wanted your daughter to spend Christmas with her step/half family? I understand that not your kid \u2260 not your problem, but this is kind of an extraneous circumstance. Also, I would have asked your 13yo what she was to do instead of you speak on everyone\u2019s behalf.", "NTA at all. But shit that\u2019s a hard situation for all.", "YTA. I would do this favor for a friend or acquaintance. This is your daughter's sister. Certainly, your refusal is not demonstrating kindness or compassion. If you can't do this for the 5 year old, do it for your daughter. How will she feel during Christmas if she knows the rest of her family is hurting and your refusal has kept her from making their difficulties a little lighter.", "Technically NTA.  It's your home and your holiday and it truly is yours to decide.  That said, I can't imagine a situation where I wouldn't want to help a 5 year old that was connected to my family have a happy holiday (she is your daughter's sister, full stop).  It's s plate at the table and a few trinkets in a stocking for a 5 year old, how is the possibility of this making your entire extended family uncomfortable?", "I hesitate to say YTA here, but there is clearly a right way to behave in this situation and what you are proposing isn\u2019t it.  \n\nHelping someone out like this, in the situation that family is in right now would be a supremely good thing and one that wouldn\u2019t be forgotten.", "YTA what a completely Christian thing to do\u2026shun a child whose parent has cancer at Christmas. Shame on you! Christmas is sacred to you\u2026bah! Evidently the teachings of Christ aren\u2019t.", "Very soft YTA... How do they regularly spend time together but half sister doesn't come to your place and they rarely meet up there? I understand you cherish your traditions, I'm the same way. But maybe demonstrate a little compassion this Christmas season?", "Nta.", "NTA\n\nYour ex-husband is an asshole for making it seem like you owe it to HIM to take care of his child by another woman by emotionally blackmailing you. FYI its not cruel of you, to not take this child in for xmas if you are not comfortable with that, and by the way he approaches it I could understand if you are vary.\n\nIf he had openly asked admitting it was a big ask maybe you would have felt differently. But instead he came at you, guns blazing so to speak.\n\nI can understand not wanting to open that door", "NAH. This is one of those situations that isn\u2019t black and white", "NAH - he's overwhelmed, and grieving already, and not being as objective as he should be about this.  And it's not like this is an affair baby, or some situation which would be specifically painful for you, so he's not completely out of line to ask.  You're more than within your rights to not want to take on a child who is from your ex's new relationship, especially since this child really should have these memories with her mother for as long as she can, and not miss her last Christmas with her to spend it with strangers.", "NTA OP. All the Y.T.A. responses probably never needed to look after a child and don't know the level of responsibilities involved. Don't let them guilt you into doing it on their high horses. This isn't even about your feelings towards/relationship with your ex. You don't know this child and have no relationship with this child, your ex is the AH for trying to guilt you into being responsible for her for Christmas. Yes, your ex's situation sucks, but it's not your responsibilities. It's a much better option for the child to spend Christmas with her own family.\n\nEdited to add: the child is 5 years old!!! That's a lot of responsibilities.", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe the people who are saying you are. Just because that is your ex-husband does not mean you owe him anything. They are not your friends or family. And the fact that neither he nor his wife have built friendships or have family relationships is not your fault or your responsibility to fix. Illness is hard, but ensuring his daughter has a good Christmas while her mother is sick is your ex-husband\u2019s responsibility. Will that be hard? Yes. Does he get to pawn off the responsibility on you? Absolutely not. The fact that he is being excused from having to deal with the difficulties here feels very much like it is only happening because of the type of \u201chimpathy\u201d extended to men when they are in difficult homemaking scenarios. The way you could offer to assist him is to allow your daughter to spend more time with him and his family over the holidays if he thinks having a greater family dynamic is important. But, again, his family\u2019s holidays are his to make special. Even if that is hard. He needs to lean on the people who are actually in his life because they want to be there, not people who literally divorced themselves from their involvement.", "YTA- you should hope that if you don\u2019t take her in, your daughter never finds out as an adult you denied her sister a holiday with her. \n\nFor heavens sake, she\u2019s a child with a sick mother. My mom has cancer currently and I\u2019m a grown woman and I can barely take it. I\u2019m falling apart daily. Christmas is the one time of the year where we aren\u2019t supposed to make it harder on people.", "NTA\n\n\nIgnore the YTA nitwits and it really doesn't matter what your daughter wants. \n\n\n\nThere is NOTHING good about taking a 5 year old and throwing her into an environment she doesn't know and isn't comfortable in full of people who don't know her and don't really want her there. \n\n\nThese idiots are calling you heartless for not making the kid feel worse because her idiot father doesn't care about what's best for his kid.  \n\n\nYou'll ruin Christmas for everybody if you agree to this stupid ass request.  The kid is 5 she's going to be fine at home.", "NTA - You are under no obligation to throw off your entire family's holiday for someone who isn't part of the family.", "NTA", "NTA", "YTA and you'll make a nice addition to Krampus' list this year.", "NTA\n\nPeople commenting here don\u2019t seem to realize that if you keep a child for any amount of time, you are legally responsible if anything happens to that child. If the child falls in your house? You\u2019re responsible for the medical bill.\n\nNo one is ever TA for refusing to watch or keep a child that is not theirs in any situation.", "NAH I don't think you should be forced to have your daughters half-child over your house if thats not something you want. It is terrible what she's going through but thats not on you. It would be a kind thing for you to allow her over for the holiday but saying no doesn't make you an AH. I don't think your ex is an AH for asking either though once you declined once he should've left it. He's just trying to look out for his other daughter and I can't fault him for that. I'm wondering why no he's no contact with his parents. For OP ro bring them up as an option seems like they were involved in his life when they were together.\n\nAlso just curious was your divorce amicable?", "This is so mean. The kid is 5 years old and your daughter's sister. How would you feel if the shoe was on the other foot and your husbands wife wouldn't let your daughter celebrate with her sister if you were incapacitated? It tells you how grave the situation is that he was crying at having to ask you to do this.\n\nIs a 5 year old really going to make you so uncomfortable? Really?\n\nYTA", "I almost want to say N T A, but have to go with ESH with the info given. He's being emotionally manipulative, but it seems harsh to be so against your daughter's half sister spending time with her at Christmas. It sounds like your ex would leave it up to you whether he's there or not, which makes his request seem a bit more reasonable, but he should accept that you said no.\n\nIf there's a history of abuse or he's always pushing boundaries, I'd be much more inclined to say N T A.", "YTA.\n\nYou're well within your rights to refuse. You don't owe your spouse anything. It's your holiday and you can celebrate it however you want.\n\nBUT you are still the AH here. This child has a sick parent, she's only five, and you have the chance to show kindness and embrace the true spirit of Christmas. Instead, you're choosing to be a hard-nose about it, and in so doing, making a lot of people's lives bleaker at a time when you could be making them brighter and more hopeful.", "You are well within your right to refuse but you are heartless for refusing so YTA . You could have had a talk with your family and daughter to gage if this would be appropriate this year. Your ex husband is reaching out for help. This kid may not be your family but she's your daughter's family and this is a situation where you should think about what's best for your daughter.", "NAH", "YTA and a hypocrite.

Does he mean buy her gifts? Or what just include her in yalls traditions?", "YTA. Nevermind your ex, someday when your daughter remembers what a horrible time it was in her other family, she is going to remember your callousness. What if this were just a kid she knew in school whose family was going through such an awful time? You say Christmas is sacred to you, but I think you've missed the point. What would your pastor or priest advise? What would you-know-who do?? Suck it up and make it a warm Xmas for this little girl.", "NTA but it\u2019s a five year old kid.  How weird could it possibly be?", "YOU GRINCH! YTA. This is NOT the Christmas spirit. I have spent Christmas before with friends family because I was going to be alone and they didn\u2019t want me to. Their family not only included me but bought me gifts. THATS WHAT CHRISTMAS IS ABOUT!!! Find out what your daughter wants and don\u2019t be so selfish.", "YTA I'm sure her father will be providing the gifts so it won't cost you any $$ and your daughter loves being with her sister, I don't think it would kill you, the little girls family is already going through something traumatic now she won't have a Christmas. No it's \"not your problem\" but have a heart, some Christmas spirit maybe?", "NTA, why can't she spend Christmas with her mom? If it ends up being terminal, wouldn't it be better to be with her mom and dad than with her dad's ex wife's family. Why does he want his 5yo to spend an important holiday with people who don't have a relationship with her except for her sister? Very weird.", "Is he expecting you to play Santa and get her presents also and your family get her presents? \n\nIf he can\u2019t afford presents there are churches and charities", "YTA oh my goodness, that's downright cold.\n\nThat little girl may not be your kid, but she is your daughter's *sister*, and that makes her family! What kind of message does this send to the child you are raising?! Rejecting a 5yo family member over the holidays, while her mother is being treated for cancer? Is this how you want her to learn family should be treated?\n\nThat poor child is going to spend your \"sacred\" holiday terrified, and your poor daughter will spend it worried sick about her little sister! \n\nGenuinely, please stop for a moment and reflect on why you are so adamant about not including her. Is this decision really in your daughter's best interests?", "NTA. I feel for that child but why would he want her to spend the holidays without her mom and dad?  He is probably overwhelmed and most likely didn\u2019t discuss this with his wife.  If they can\u2019t celebrate Christmas because she\u2019s too tired he should step up. If they can\u2019t afford Christmas because the us healthcare system sucks, maybe get her presents from your daughter. \n\nThe manipulation is unreal from him though and it\u2019s good you closed the door on that conversation.", "NTA. This is an odd request. You don\u2019t know this child and have no responsibility for her but you\u2019re supposed to bring her to your family\u2019s holiday.  It\u2019s a nice sentiment but where does the line get drawn? Are your family supposed to buy her gifts too? And is this going to open the door for you to  take her regularly? She should really be with her mother at this time. I\u2019d stick by my no.", "NTA. Not an ideal situation for him, sure, but that is not your child and you do not need to spend Christmas with them.", "NTA\n\nMen, stop asking ex partners to solve current problems. Sad for 5 year old but absolutely not a boundary he should ask to cross.", "OP, you should tell him you wouldn't DREAM of keeping that little girl from her mommy. It might be their last chance to make holiday memories together.\nFlip this shit back on him. He's the monster for depriving his child.", "Nta.\nThe father and her mother should be making the best of this Christmas and building memories with their child, as God forbid this could be the last. Rather than passing this responsibility to the ex, who is not responsible in anyway.", "Nta i dont understand the yta its not her kid and she doesnt feel comfertable and her children spend time at the half sisters house because they share the same dad", "NTA It's up to her father to make the day special.  He will try to do this every holiday if you allow it.\nYour ex is the ***hole.", "INFO: You spoke to your family but did that include your daughter? I get not being comfortable with this arrangement but her opinion should be heard imo.", "Hmm I don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily wrong here, and he definitely IS wrong because he pushed and tried to manipulate you. That said, his reasons for asking are actually good ones. How about you ask your daughter what she would prefer?\n\nNTA, well within your rights, but a little bit cold, since it\u2019s Christmas and she\u2019s so young.", "You\u2019re certainly under no obligation to do this. But these two girls are innocents and should not be put in the middle of your issues with your ex. Sometimes it\u2019s just nice to be nice. So do something nice for a child who\u2019s mother has cancer. I\u2019m saying NAH, but leaning towards YTA. Your ex is overwhelmed and needs some help - you\u2019re in a position to help but for whatever reason, won\u2019t.", "I kind of want to say YTA.   Your Christmas celebration isn't that \"sacred\" lol.  It's the same thing everyone does with family.  If the girl was your daughters best friend and not your ex's, you really wouldn't include her out of kindness even just for dinner?   I'm not sure why the whole family can be made uncomfortable by the presence of one extra kid at dinner. You certainly don't have to, but this is a one-off and a charitable thing.", "Ahhh, exclusion.  That's the Christmas spirit. /s  That poor child. YTA", "NTA they don't have other family or friends? It would be so awkward for her.", "YTA. You might be right in normal time but we are talking about a 5yo whose Mom has cancer. Christmas spirit much?", "YTA so resented that you can't do an act of kindness.", "YTA. I can't imagine treating my child's sibling this way. Your kid will remember this.", "INFO: What does your daughter think about this idea?", "NTA. You don\u2019t have an obligation to take his kid in for Christmas if you don\u2019t feel comfortable to do that. People watches way too much Christmas movies. It\u2019s just a holiday. He is the AH for put a lot of pressures on you after you said no. He could have just respect it, leave you be and do his work on find another way for his daughter like have her celebrate Xmas with his wife\u2019s family side or spend it together.", "I\u2019m going to go with NAH, you\u2019re justified in not wanting her there and your ex feels overwhelmed and thinks he\u2019s making the best call. What should happen is that she should spend the possible last Christmas she has with her mom, with her mom. That would do well for her in the long run and he\u2019s only thinking short term; she\u2019ll look back on this Christmas as \u201cthe year she spent surrounded by strangers\u201d\u2014I doubt she even wants to be around your family. A fair solution would be your daughter spending a hour or so at the hospital cafeteria (or wherever they are) with her sister, maybe bring a plate of food for them to eat together. \n\nAlso, for the people talking about how you\u2019re not acting in the best interest of religion\u2014if that\u2019s your only moral compass you\u2019re whacked in the head.", "INFO - how is your relationship with your ex? How is your co-parenting arrangement?

What happened to Christmas spirit?", "NTA\n\nYou're family isn't comfortable with it, you aren't comfortable with it, so you aren't TA for refusing. \n\nBut I can't imagine that little girl would want to be separated from her dad during such a hard time. When my dad was sick with cancer my mom made it a point for me to be with him.", "YTA. In my opinion this is heartless. The child is only 5 years old and obviously losing it\u2018s mother. Your daugther and the daugther of your ex are getting along very well, and I think you as an adult have a responsibility", "Wow that\u2019s emotional blackmail at its finest\u2026 you\u2019ll end up being the babysitter. Stick with your guns.. NTA that\u2019s for sure", "YTA it\u2019s good to be a good human being.", "NAH. On both sides there\u2019s pain and support going both ways could be good for the innocent children in this. I fully understand why you\u2019d say no and him being pushy is out of line, but if your daughter and her sister get on well then it might be worth giving it a think and doing a pros/cons list. Perhaps there\u2019s more animosity between you due to your breakup and more story that we\u2019re unaware of here which makes it difficult to really give a judgement. \n\nPerhaps if his wife is actively dying then he\u2019s trying to spare her this last memory of her mother at Christmas? Either way whatever your decision is going to be it has to be one you\u2019re certain of and one made with great care.", "Not your kid, not your problem.

It's a child, meaning your divorce is not her fault. Her mom could be dying. (Though I do not understand why they wouldn't want to spend a possible last Christmas together.)

She's welcome. My son has a friend who doesn't celebrate but wants to come? we've got a plate for you. Some random ass kid shows up on my doorstep and asks for some eggnog cake? Come on in, you can have some hot cocoa with it! \n\nyou're celebrating the birth of a man who turned up at parties to multiply the bread and fish, to make wine, who befriended sinners of all stripes, and you can't extend that kindness on his birthday to a five year old child? \n\nShame on you.", "Info: what does the 13 year old think, if anything?", "NTA. \n\nSo... Yes, this child might not have their mother around next Christmas. This is a child that you had NO INVOLVEMENT and no choice in creating. There are MILLIONS of children that fit that description. Are you going to take them all in? Give them a roof over their heads? An environment to enjoy Christmas in? Ideally yes, but realistically, HARD no. Just because you had a child with the man and after you split up with him he decided with his new partner to have another child, you were in no way obligated to take care of that child, no matter his or your financial or familial situations. And I have to agree with the other comments that this will only be a foot in the door to make you take care of other parental responsibilities for the child that is not yours. If his spouse is still alive and he's even now handing parental responsibilities to you and guilt tripping you into accepting them, don't be surprised if down the road he places financial and child-rearing responsibilities on you as well.\n\nI've had many Christmases that were essentially \"broke\", but I was always happy to spend it with family. This wouldn't have changed a bit even if one of them was dying in the hospital. Would it have been hard to see them dying? Yes, but I never would have wanted a stand-in \"mother\" to have taken their place. I feel like this is an attempt on his part to yank your heart-strings, agree to this teeny tiny thing, and use it as leverage down the line to make you responsible for something you had no part in in the first place.", "INFO. I don't know what your \"sacred\" Christmas tradition is but you sure are cold toward your daughter's 5 year old sister, that you say she adores.

I\u2019ve been in a split family situation, both as a child and as an adult, and I\u2019m proud to say that unlike my parents, I put my son and his relationship with his half siblings ahead of any of my feelings. He\u2019s 26 now and I\u2019m fully included in the whole of his life. Put your emotions aside and think about the bigger picture. Also, doesn\u2019t it set a great example for your child if you help her father a little bit when the chips are down?", "NTA this is a slippery slope to you becoming daughters care giver. Maybe him and his wife should plan better for their child.", "NTA. His daughter needs to be at home. Christmas does not need to be a houseful of decorations. A few garlands  and a fake prelit 4 foot tree. Buy a few dozen cheap plastic ornaments and the kid can decorate the tree while mom lays on the couch. Then they can share hot cocoa and watch a Christmas movie on TV. Take twenty or so pics for a photo album of their last Christmas together. That\u2019s all a five year old needs -her parents, love and a bit of glitter. Why does he want to get rid of her? What makes your Christmas celebration so perfect in his eyes? Wonder if his wife knows what he is doing? Bet she doesn\u2019t. Her perfect Christmas would involve having her kid next to her.", "NTA. \n\nIf she was older it would be a different conversation.

He pointed out how thd girks will have a great time together bonding and making memories but I said I was sorry but my family's traditional celebration is a sacred thing and I do not feel comfortable including anyone else. He said that his daughter may not be family to me but she sure is to her halfsister. He asked me to stop and \"think\" about what's best for the kids here. I suggested he take his daughter to spend christmas with her grandparents and tried to cut the conversation shirt but he stopped me and started going on about how cruel it was for me to decline to include his daughter who's already having a hard time adjusting. I saw that he was beginning to cry so I stepped back and said I was no longer feel comfortable having this conversation.

The daughter probably wants to be there for her half sister who's going through hell. I agree with other commentators that say it would be better for the child to spend Christmas with her mom, regardless of what that looks like, but if her mom is very very visibly sick and and they are shielding her from that I can understand where the day is coming from. It would probably be very difficult for her to spend time with adults she doesn't know so dad should do his best to do something the three of them. I do feel like OP might want to get used to the child spending more time with them though if her daughter is so attached to her half sister. My friend was super attached to her half sister growing up even though they lived in different Countries- she lived with her dad and step mum and they often welcomed the half sister in their home to have sleepovers ect, despite being the child of an affair because the children have done nothing wrong and can't help the circumstances they are in because of their parents. Maybe they could have the child over for Christmas cookie making and she could take them to her mum in hospital? She'll have memories of doing something Christmassy with her sister and  mum then and as memories of children blur as they get older would probably be a really precious memory and support daughter in knowing that she is okay to want to spend her time with her half sister as kids pick up on things and you  don't want to push her away by rejecting her sister", "If a neighbor asked me to include their child, (for the same reasons) I would.
