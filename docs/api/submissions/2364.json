We share custody of our 13 year old daughter. He got married and has a 5 year old daughter with his now wife.\n\n\nHis daughter would spend time with my daughter regularly. They adore each other but she doesn't come to my house and they rarely meet up there.\n\n\nHis wife has been diagnosed with cancer and has started treatment recently. The other day he came to drop our daughter off and asked to speak to me. He talked about his wife's circumstances then how his family won't be able to have a christmas celebration this year. He said it wasn't fair for his daughter and asked if I could \"include\" her in my family's celebration. He pointed out how the girls will have a great time together bonding and making memories, but I said I was sorry but my family's traditional celebration is a sacred thing and I do not feel comfortable including anyone else. Plus it'd be awkward having her in my home. He said that his daughter may not be family to me but she sure is to her halfsister. He asked me to stop and \"think\" about what's best for the kids here. I suggested he take his daughter to spend christmas with her grandparents (he said his parents and him are NC) and tried to cut the conversation short but he stopped me and started going on about how cruel it was for me to decline to include his daughter who's already having a hard time adjusting. I saw that he was beginning to cry so I stepped back and said I was no longer feeling comfortable having this conversation. I asked him to leave and he did but still texted me asking me to agree to let his daughter come spend christmas even offered that he stays away if that'll make me less uncomfortable, I said no and now he's calling me selfish and unfeeling.\n\n\n*A point worth mentioning here and that is my family are going to attend and they said that they too will not feel comfortable in this situation thus I said it'd be awkward.*", "created_utc": 1668514181, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvvc84/aita_for_not_allowing_my_daughters_half_sister_to/", "score": 5766, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What is ex planning if he wants to dump his kid on you?", "I\u2019m wondering what is going on here for there to be such harsh feelings about this child spending Christmas with her sibling and family. Did you guys get a divorce because of the woman he is married to now? Or was the divorce just sprung on you and now there is bitterness towards ex husband. Please help us understand because right now you are coming out as YTA", "Nta", "YTA", "NTA", "YTA. I know you don\u2019t owe him anything but I am sorry you have no compassion for this innocent child who is losing her mother. This is heartbreaking. She is your child\u2019s family.", "It would be a really nice thing for you to have half-sister over for Christmas, and would barely be any extra hassle. I have a half-brother (who is emotionally the same as a brother to me) and I'm really pleased that my late dad found the time to be nice to him and to occasionally take him out with me and my full-brother. No matter how much he disliked my half-brother's parents.\n\nI dunno, it just means a lot to me that my dad liked my half-brother. Also my half-bro (weird calling him that) really helped me out a week ago. so in 15 or 20 years' time your daughter might lean really heavily on her half-sister, they might help each-other out in ways you'd be eternally grateful for. So yknow, be nice.\n\nReddit's going to tell you you're NTA and I am aware of that. Ignore the votes and make an extra plate for a needy almost-family-member this Christmas.", "NTA. That's a big ask by him and it's not your responsibility to spend yours christmas minding someone else's (your ex!) child if you don't want too.", "YTA for refusing to see the larger picture here.. a child's emotional well being. You didn't even ask your daughter if she would want that.", "YTA 1000% Geez!  YTA.", "Technically NTA\nBut man her mum has cancer, she is 5 she doesn\u2019t understand why her mum is sick.

He should not assume that you are willing to carry any of his baggage. It\u2019s rough to be with someone with cancer, I get it. But maybe he should consider letting his young daughter spend Christmas with her mother before she can\u2019t anymore. \nOP: have at least a little compassion for the situation. What would you do if you had cancer and wanted your daughter to spend Christmas with her step/half family? I understand that not your kid \u2260 not your problem, but this is kind of an extraneous circumstance. Also, I would have asked your 13yo what she was to do instead of you speak on everyone\u2019s behalf.", "NTA at all. But shit that\u2019s a hard situation for all.", "YTA. I would do this favor for a friend or acquaintance. This is your daughter's sister. Certainly, your refusal is not demonstrating kindness or compassion. If you can't do this for the 5 year old, do it for your daughter. How will she feel during Christmas if she knows the rest of her family is hurting and your refusal has kept her from making their difficulties a little lighter.", "Technically NTA.  It's your home and your holiday and it truly is yours to decide.  That said, I can't imagine a situation where I wouldn't want to help a 5 year old that was connected to my family have a happy holiday (she is your daughter's sister, full stop).  It's s plate at the table and a few trinkets in a stocking for a 5 year old, how is the possibility of this making your entire extended family uncomfortable?", "I hesitate to say YTA here, but there is clearly a right way to behave in this situation and what you are proposing isn\u2019t it.  \n\nHelping someone out like this, in the situation that family is in right now would be a supremely good thing and one that wouldn\u2019t be forgotten.", "YTA what a completely Christian thing to do\u2026shun a child whose parent has cancer at Christmas. Shame on you! Christmas is sacred to you\u2026bah! Evidently the teachings of Christ aren\u2019t.", "Very soft YTA... How do they regularly spend time together but half sister doesn't come to your place and they rarely meet up there? I understand you cherish your traditions, I'm the same way. But maybe demonstrate a little compassion this Christmas season?", "Nta.", "NTA\n\nYour ex-husband is an asshole for making it seem like you owe it to HIM to take care of his child by another woman by emotionally blackmailing you. FYI its not cruel of you, to not take this child in for xmas if you are not comfortable with that, and by the way he approaches it I could understand if you are vary.\n\nIf he had openly asked admitting it was a big ask maybe you would have felt differently.

And it's not like this is an affair baby, or some situation which would be specifically painful for you, so he's not completely out of line to ask.  You're more than within your rights to not want to take on a child who is from your ex's new relationship, especially since this child really should have these memories with her mother for as long as she can, and not miss her last Christmas with her to spend it with strangers.", "NTA OP. All the Y.T.A. responses probably never needed to look after a child and don't know the level of responsibilities involved. Don't let them guilt you into doing it on their high horses. This isn't even about your feelings towards/relationship with your ex. You don't know this child and have no relationship with this child, your ex is the AH for trying to guilt you into being responsible for her for Christmas. Yes, your ex's situation sucks, but it's not your responsibilities. It's a much better option for the child to spend Christmas with her own family.\n\nEdited to add: the child is 5 years old!!! That's a lot of responsibilities.", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe the people who are saying you are. Just because that is your ex-husband does not mean you owe him anything. They are not your friends or family. And the fact that neither he nor his wife have built friendships or have family relationships is not your fault or your responsibility to fix. Illness is hard, but ensuring his daughter has a good Christmas while her mother is sick is your ex-husband\u2019s responsibility. Will that be hard? Yes. Does he get to pawn off the responsibility on you? Absolutely not. The fact that he is being excused from having to deal with the difficulties here feels very much like it is only happening because of the type of \u201chimpathy\u201d extended to men when they are in difficult homemaking scenarios. The way you could offer to assist him is to allow your daughter to spend more time with him and his family over the holidays if he thinks having a greater family dynamic is important. But, again, his family\u2019s holidays are his to make special. Even if that is hard. He needs to lean on the people who are actually in his life because they want to be there, not people who literally divorced themselves from their involvement.", "YTA- you should hope that if you don\u2019t take her in, your daughter never finds out as an adult you denied her sister a holiday with her. \n\nFor heavens sake, she\u2019s a child with a sick mother. My mom has cancer currently and I\u2019m a grown woman and I can barely take it. I\u2019m falling apart daily. Christmas is the one time of the year where we aren\u2019t supposed to make it harder on people.", "NTA\n\n\nIgnore the YTA nitwits and it really doesn't matter what your daughter wants. \n\n\n\nThere is NOTHING good about taking a 5 year old and throwing her into an environment she doesn't know and isn't comfortable in full of people who don't know her and don't really want her there. \n\n\nThese idiots are calling you heartless for not making the kid feel worse because her idiot father doesn't care about what's best for his kid.  \n\n\nYou'll ruin Christmas for everybody if you agree to this stupid ass request.  The kid is 5 she's going to be fine at home.", "NTA - You are under no obligation to throw off your entire family's holiday for someone who isn't part of the family.", "NTA", "NTA", "YTA and you'll make a nice addition to Krampus' list this year.", "NTA\n\nPeople commenting here don\u2019t seem to realize that if you keep a child for any amount of time, you are legally responsible if anything happens to that child. If the child falls in your house? You\u2019re responsible for the medical bill.\n\nNo one is ever TA for refusing to watch or keep a child that is not theirs in any situation.", "NAH I don't think you should be forced to have your daughters half-child over your house if thats not something you want. It is terrible what she's going through but thats not on you. It would be a kind thing for you to allow her over for the holiday but saying no doesn't make you an AH. I don't think your ex is an AH for asking either though once you declined once he should've left it. He's just trying to look out for his other daughter and I can't fault him for that. I'm wondering why no he's no contact with his parents. For OP ro bring them up as an option seems like they were involved in his life when they were together.\n\nAlso just curious was your divorce amicable?", "This is so mean. The kid is 5 years old and your daughter's sister. How would you feel if the shoe was on the other foot and your husbands wife wouldn't let your daughter celebrate with her sister if you were incapacitated? It tells you how grave the situation is that he was crying at having to ask you to do this.\n\nIs a 5 year old really going to make you so uncomfortable? Really?\n\nYTA", "I almost want to say N T A, but have to go with ESH with the info given. He's being emotionally manipulative, but it seems harsh to be so against your daughter's half sister spending time with her at Christmas. It sounds like your ex would leave it up to you whether he's there or not, which makes his request seem a bit more reasonable, but he should accept that you said no.\n\nIf there's a history of abuse or he's always pushing boundaries, I'd be much more inclined to say N T A.", "YTA.\n\nYou're well within your rights to refuse. You don't owe your spouse anything. It's your holiday and you can celebrate it however you want.\n\nBUT you are still the AH here. This child has a sick parent, she's only five, and you have the chance to show kindness and embrace the true spirit of Christmas. Instead, you're choosing to be a hard-nose about it, and in so doing, making a lot of people's lives bleaker at a time when you could be making them brighter and more hopeful.", "You are well within your right to refuse but you are heartless for refusing so YTA . You could have had a talk with your family and daughter to gage if this would be appropriate this year. Your ex husband is reaching out for help.

Does he mean buy her gifts? Or what just include her in yalls traditions?", "YTA. Nevermind your ex, someday when your daughter remembers what a horrible time it was in her other family, she is going to remember your callousness. What if this were just a kid she knew in school whose family was going through such an awful time? You say Christmas is sacred to you, but I think you've missed the point. What would your pastor or priest advise? What would you-know-who do?? Suck it up and make it a warm Xmas for this little girl.", "NTA but it\u2019s a five year old kid.  How weird could it possibly be?", "YOU GRINCH! YTA. This is NOT the Christmas spirit. I have spent Christmas before with friends family because I was going to be alone and they didn\u2019t want me to. Their family not only included me but bought me gifts. THATS WHAT CHRISTMAS IS ABOUT!!! Find out what your daughter wants and don\u2019t be so selfish.", "YTA I'm sure her father will be providing the gifts so it won't cost you any $$ and your daughter loves being with her sister, I don't think it would kill you, the little girls family is already going through something traumatic now she won't have a Christmas. No it's \"not your problem\" but have a heart, some Christmas spirit maybe?", "NTA, why can't she spend Christmas with her mom? If it ends up being terminal, wouldn't it be better to be with her mom and dad than with her dad's ex wife's family. Why does he want his 5yo to spend an important holiday with people who don't have a relationship with her except for her sister? Very weird.", "Is he expecting you to play Santa and get her presents also and your family get her presents? \n\nIf he can\u2019t afford presents there are churches and charities", "YTA oh my goodness, that's downright cold.\n\nThat little girl may not be your kid, but she is your daughter's *sister*, and that makes her family! What kind of message does this send to the child you are raising?! Rejecting a 5yo family member over the holidays, while her mother is being treated for cancer? Is this how you want her to learn family should be treated?\n\nThat poor child is going to spend your \"sacred\" holiday terrified, and your poor daughter will spend it worried sick about her little sister! \n\nGenuinely, please stop for a moment and reflect on why you are so adamant about not including her. Is this decision really in your daughter's best interests?", "NTA. I feel for that child but why would he want her to spend the holidays without her mom and dad?  He is probably overwhelmed and most likely didn\u2019t discuss this with his wife.  If they can\u2019t celebrate Christmas because she\u2019s too tired he should step up. If they can\u2019t afford Christmas because the us healthcare system sucks, maybe get her presents from your daughter. \n\nThe manipulation is unreal from him though and it\u2019s good you closed the door on that conversation.", "NTA. This is an odd request. You don\u2019t know this child and have no responsibility for her but you\u2019re supposed to bring her to your family\u2019s holiday.  It\u2019s a nice sentiment but where does the line get drawn? Are your family supposed to buy her gifts too? And is this going to open the door for you to  take her regularly? She should really be with her mother at this time. I\u2019d stick by my no.", "NTA. Not an ideal situation for him, sure, but that is not your child and you do not need to spend Christmas with them.", "NTA\n\nMen, stop asking ex partners to solve current problems. Sad for 5 year old but absolutely not a boundary he should ask to cross.", "OP, you should tell him you wouldn't DREAM of keeping that little girl from her mommy. It might be their last chance to make holiday memories together.\nFlip this shit back on him. He's the monster for depriving his child.", "Nta.\nThe father and her mother should be making the best of this Christmas and building memories with their child, as God forbid this could be the last. Rather than passing this responsibility to the ex, who is not responsible in anyway.", "Nta i dont understand the yta its not her kid and she doesnt feel comfertable and her children spend time at the half sisters house because they share the same dad", "NTA It's up to her father to make the day special.  He will try to do this every holiday if you allow it.\nYour ex is the ***hole.", "INFO: You spoke to your family but did that include your daughter? I get not being comfortable with this arrangement but her opinion should be heard imo.", "Hmm I don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily wrong here, and he definitely IS wrong because he pushed and tried to manipulate you. That said, his reasons for asking are actually good ones. How about you ask your daughter what she would prefer?\n\nNTA, well within your rights, but a little bit cold, since it\u2019s Christmas and she\u2019s so young.", "You\u2019re certainly under no obligation to do this. But these two girls are innocents and should not be put in the middle of your issues with your ex. Sometimes it\u2019s just nice to be nice. So do something nice for a child who\u2019s mother has cancer. I\u2019m saying NAH, but leaning towards YTA. Your ex is overwhelmed and needs some help - you\u2019re in a position to help but for whatever reason, won\u2019t.", "I kind of want to say YTA.   Your Christmas celebration isn't that \"sacred\" lol.  It's the same thing everyone does with family.  If the girl was your daughters best friend and not your ex's, you really wouldn't include her out of kindness even just for dinner?   I'm not sure why the whole family can be made uncomfortable by the presence of one extra kid at dinner. You certainly don't have to, but this is a one-off and a charitable thing.", "Ahhh, exclusion.  That's the Christmas spirit. /s  That poor child. YTA", "NTA they don't have other family or friends? It would be so awkward for her.", "YTA. You might be right in normal time but we are talking about a 5yo whose Mom has cancer. Christmas spirit much?", "YTA so resented that you can't do an act of kindness.", "YTA. I can't imagine treating my child's sibling this way. Your kid will remember this.", "INFO: What does your daughter think about this idea?", "NTA. You don\u2019t have an obligation to take his kid in for Christmas if you don\u2019t feel comfortable to do that. People watches way too much Christmas movies. It\u2019s just a holiday.

He could have just respect it, leave you be and do his work on find another way for his daughter like have her celebrate Xmas with his wife\u2019s family side or spend it together.", "I\u2019m going to go with NAH, you\u2019re justified in not wanting her there and your ex feels overwhelmed and thinks he\u2019s making the best call. What should happen is that she should spend the possible last Christmas she has with her mom, with her mom. That would do well for her in the long run and he\u2019s only thinking short term; she\u2019ll look back on this Christmas as \u201cthe year she spent surrounded by strangers\u201d\u2014I doubt she even wants to be around your family. A fair solution would be your daughter spending a hour or so at the hospital cafeteria (or wherever they are) with her sister, maybe bring a plate of food for them to eat together. \n\nAlso, for the people talking about how you\u2019re not acting in the best interest of religion\u2014if that\u2019s your only moral compass you\u2019re whacked in the head.", "INFO - how is your relationship with your ex? How is your co-parenting arrangement?

What happened to Christmas spirit?", "NTA\n\nYou're family isn't comfortable with it, you aren't comfortable with it, so you aren't TA for refusing. \n\nBut I can't imagine that little girl would want to be separated from her dad during such a hard time.\n\n When my dad was sick with cancer my mom made it a point for me to be with him. It ended up being his last Christmas. \nHis daughter needs that time with mom, not with a strangers family.", "YTA. In my opinion this is heartless.

On both sides there\u2019s pain and support going both ways could be good for the innocent children in this. I fully understand why you\u2019d say no and him being pushy is out of line, but if your daughter and her sister get on well then it might be worth giving it a think and doing a pros/cons list. Perhaps there\u2019s more animosity between you due to your breakup and more story that we\u2019re unaware of here which makes it difficult to really give a judgement. \n\nPerhaps if his wife is actively dying then he\u2019s trying to spare her this last memory of her mother at Christmas?

It's a child, meaning your divorce is not her fault. Her mom could be dying. (Though I do not understand why they wouldn't want to spend a possible last Christmas together.)

She's welcome. My son has a friend who doesn't celebrate but wants to come? we've got a plate for you. Some random ass kid shows up on my doorstep and asks for some eggnog cake? Come on in, you can have some hot cocoa with it! \n\nyou're celebrating the birth of a man who turned up at parties to multiply the bread and fish, to make wine, who befriended sinners of all stripes, and you can't extend that kindness on his birthday to a five year old child? \n\nShame on you.", "Info: what does the 13 year old think, if anything?", "NTA. \n\nSo... Yes, this child might not have their mother around next Christmas. This is a child that you had NO INVOLVEMENT and no choice in creating. There are MILLIONS of children that fit that description. Are you going to take them all in? Give them a roof over their heads? An environment to enjoy Christmas in? Ideally yes, but realistically, HARD no. Just because you had a child with the man and after you split up with him he decided with his new partner to have another child, you were in no way obligated to take care of that child, no matter his or your financial or familial situations. And I have to agree with the other comments that this will only be a foot in the door to make you take care of other parental responsibilities for the child that is not yours. If his spouse is still alive and he's even now handing parental responsibilities to you and guilt tripping you into accepting them, don't be surprised if down the road he places financial and child-rearing responsibilities on you as well.\n\nI've had many Christmases that were essentially \"broke\", but I was always happy to spend it with family. This wouldn't have changed a bit even if one of them was dying in the hospital. Would it have been hard to see them dying? Yes, but I never would have wanted a stand-in \"mother\" to have taken their place. I feel like this is an attempt on his part to yank your heart-strings, agree to this teeny tiny thing, and use it as leverage down the line to make you responsible for something you had no part in in the first place.", "INFO. I don't know what your \"sacred\" Christmas tradition is but you sure are cold toward your daughter's 5 year old sister, that you say she adores.

I\u2019ve been in a split family situation, both as a child and as an adult, and I\u2019m proud to say that unlike my parents, I put my son and his relationship with his half siblings ahead of any of my feelings. He\u2019s 26 now and I\u2019m fully included in the whole of his life. Put your emotions aside and think about the bigger picture. Also, doesn\u2019t it set a great example for your child if you help her father a little bit when the chips are down?", "NTA this is a slippery slope to you becoming daughters care giver. Maybe him and his wife should plan better for their child.", "NTA. His daughter needs to be at home. Christmas does not need to be a houseful of decorations. A few garlands  and a fake prelit 4 foot tree. Buy a few dozen cheap plastic ornaments and the kid can decorate the tree while mom lays on the couch. Then they can share hot cocoa and watch a Christmas movie on TV. Take twenty or so pics for a photo album of their last Christmas together. That\u2019s all a five year old needs -her parents, love and a bit of glitter. Why does he want to get rid of her? What makes your Christmas celebration so perfect in his eyes?

He pointed out how thd girks will have a great time together bonding and making memories but I said I was sorry but my family's traditional celebration is a sacred thing and I do not feel comfortable including anyone else. He said that his daughter may not be family to me but she sure is to her halfsister. He asked me to stop and \"think\" about what's best for the kids here. I suggested he take his daughter to spend christmas with her grandparents and tried to cut the conversation shirt but he stopped me and started going on about how cruel it was for me to decline to include his daughter who's already having a hard time adjusting. I saw that he was beginning to cry so I stepped back and said I was no longer feel comfortable having this conversation.

The daughter probably wants to be there for her half sister who's going through hell. I agree with other commentators that say it would be better for the child to spend Christmas with her mom, regardless of what that looks like, but if her mom is very very visibly sick and and they are shielding her from that I can understand where the day is coming from. It would probably be very difficult for her to spend time with adults she doesn't know so dad should do his best to do something the three of them. I do feel like OP might want to get used to the child spending more time with them though if her daughter is so attached to her half sister. My friend was super attached to her half sister growing up even though they lived in different Countries- she lived with her dad and step mum and they often welcomed the half sister in their home to have sleepovers ect, despite being the child of an affair because the children have done nothing wrong and can't help the circumstances they are in because of their parents. Maybe they could have the child over for Christmas cookie making and she could take them to her mum in hospital? She'll have memories of doing something Christmassy with her sister and  mum then and as memories of children blur as they get older would probably be a really precious memory and support daughter in knowing that she is okay to want to spend her time with her half sister as kids pick up on things and you  don't want to push her away by rejecting her sister", "If a neighbor asked me to include their child, (for the same reasons) I would.

I don\u2019t know about you, but I would want that for my child. Hell, I\u2019d beg for it.", "The child is a stranger to her even if biologically her child's half sibling and she is  not comfortable with it. Compassion is a beautiful thing, but this child may lose their last Christmas with their mother and that is not compassionate to them either.", "And? Like I\u2019m genuinely curious why that should matter to a five year old at Christmas. She would want to be with her parents. Again. Strangers and her half sister is who will be around her *on christmas* clearly unwanting of her presence (adults only but we are assuming the 13 year old likes her.)", "It's easy to be nice and compassationate online but it's hars to actually do it. Everyone shut the fk up when it's their turn to actually provide or help. That's right. Not your time spent ? Shut your mouth lmao. Why don't you take care of your ex kid ? Why should op's family even accept their ex kid ? Maybe Op's family don't want anything to do with her ex or her ex's kid ? Like... think before you speak", "NTA. I kind of see where others are coming from, but I disagree.  This is the child that your ex husband had with his new partner, and he needs to understand that there are boundaries that need to be respected. It\u2019s not about the kid, it\u2019s about his disrespect for you. He has the right to ask, and you have the right to decline. End of. The fact that he\u2019s persisting is what makes him TA. I dare say he was always like this, very selfish and immature and just wants his own way. And also, you are not a babysitter. He may be NC with his parents, but what about his new wife\u2019s family? Surely there are other people in his life, other than you, that he could turn to in this situation.\n\nETA: cancer does not mean she is dying; I saw in another comment that they equated cancer to dying. But I would be interested to know what type of cancer his wife has, how advanced it is, what her prognosis is etc.", "NTA- currently I am taking chemo.  It sucks.  I mean really really sucks.  Your ex can order food in and have a small Christmas with his child and wife.  As a Mom, I would want to see my child on Christmas Day.  Even if the prognosis looks good, you live with the fear that you may not see you child grow up and would want to spend the holidays with them knowing it could be your last. \n\nThat being said.  Chemo is debilitating.  In my case, hair falls out, so tired that you can barely do anything, constant battle with both ends, body on fire etc\u2026 This is your daughter\u2019s sister, this is Christmas, you don\u2019t owe you ex anything but please try to find some grace for this poor child.  My kids are older teens and they are taking my illness HARD.  I can\u2019t imagine how difficult it would be with a 5 year old.\n\nAgain You don\u2019t owe your ex crap.  You don\u2019t need to take her on Christmas but the break is 2 weeks.  This is a child who really is in need of someone who can bring her a tiny bit of joy.  Being with her sister could do that.  Maybe you could take her for a half day for photos with Santa? A movie? Maybe even just making some crafts and cookies.  Something to get her out over the holidays.  This is Christmas, please find it in your heart to remember that this is a young child who is your daughter\u2019s sister with a really sick Mom.  Even just a little time away from the situation would benefit this kid and make your daughter happy.  Thanks", "NTA\nI don't understand your ex at all. If his wife really is as sick as it seems it would make more sense for them to spend Christmas together, it might be the last.\nIt sucks that the kid has to go through this but I don't think it would help her if her father just offloads her at her half sisters family. She would spend the day with basically strangers not knowing/understanding where her family is.", "You are NTA for refusing - your feelings on the subject are totally valid; but i think i'd have done it anyway; none of the adults in this situation are nearly as important as a small child whose mother is having health problems and who won't get christmas as a result.", "NTA it's not your responsibility and you're well within your rights to refuse.

Why can't the ex have his own kid around for Christmas? Yeah mom is sick but wouldn't that make it even more important to have the holiday as a family and make sure their young daughter gets another holiday with her mom to make memories and be together? Why is the kid being sent away? Cancer sucks and is rough and I can understand being worried about the effect it will have on a 5 year old BUT part of being a parent is helping your kids navigate hard stuff like this. That means she actually has to be there in order for her parents to help her grieve and cope and prepare. I'm not sure what the ex is doing here but the OP is NOT wrong for saying she won't be his babysitter/kid therapist/responsible party for his child over a holiday. The ex needs to man up and do his job, not ask his ex wife to do it for him.", "NTA - if we take this situation and tweak it, and say it\u2019s not during the holidays, but maybe just some random weekend, would you be getting all these YTA judgements? I think not. Also, if your family is uncomfortable, they may make her uncomfortable as well. You don\u2019t want to put that on a 5 yr old. Your Ex had nothing to lose by asking, but once you said no, he should have given up rather than trying to force you to reconsider.", "Question: Would you allow one of your daughter\u2019s  friends to spend Christmas with your family due to similar circumstances?

I understand you may feel some type of way towards your ex, but i can\u2019t fathom how the presence of a 5-year-old could make multiple adults uncomfortable.

Your reasoning that your family\u2019s tradition is a sacred thing seems kind of a cop out. Like, isn\u2019t the whole point of Christmas to be loving and giving, etc?

That said, she\u2019s still a little girl. take it out of the equation that she is your ex child, she\u2019s going through a lot and I would hope your family would open their heart to a little girl on the holidays out of the spirit of the season.", "NTA\n\nMaking her spend christmas with you, a person she rarely talks to and your family a bunch of people she has no relation with, will just make her feel she doesn't belong there the entire night.

The classic but you had her last Christmas bullshit.", "Interesting to see how split the comments are. I would say that it would definitively be a nice thing to do, but you don't have an obligation to do it. If I read between the lines, it seems like you haven't spent much time with this girl (you feel it would be awkward to have her in your home) and don't know how she is. Taking care of a 5 year old who is a stranger to you while hosting a Christmas celebration might become difficult. What do you do if she starts crying because she misses her parents? What if she runs away or has a meltdown? If you and your family were on board with this idea, you would together find a way to handle the situation, but if you just find it bothersome, it would just be a bad situation for everyone involved. Not all 5 year olds will just sit quiet and follow instructions.\n\nI'm guessing your daughter would be the only one the girl would know there, so it would probably become your daughter's responsibility to deal with her - especially if the girl gets upset in some way.

Break other kids presents? Scream you aren't her mommy?? WTF is wrong with the adults who can't handle seeing a little girl at their party?\n\nJust the fact she exists is awkward for you apparently.  Not so nice way of role modeling kindness and support for family for your daughter, who would most likely want her sister there.

It means being responsible for a 5 year old you aren't related to, making sure she has a good time, and the accompanying mental load.

It could be fine but it also could end up that you don't get to enjoy your Christmas.\n\nI think what really gets me is your ex doubling down. If he had been respectful about you saying no, at least that would give space for you to think about it and change your mind. But since he called you selfish and unfeeling, if you say yes now it shows he can bully you into babysitting. \n\nBut damn has this man never seen The Grinch, A Christmas Carol, or basically any other Christmas movie? Celebrating Christmas is about being with loved ones, not the presents or the big feast. It's not about the decorations either - though with a bit of creativity you can make some.

Does her mom even know daddy is trying to foist his daughter on his ex instead of stepping up and doing Christmas for her? Even not going to see any family, he should go out of his way to make Christmas extra special for that little girl WITH her mom! I cannot imagine her mom does not want to spend Christmas with her, especially while going through chemo. Hate to say it, but what if this turned out to be her last Christmas with her child?

Why are you so desperate to see him as this vile villain? Isn't it more believable that they can't do Christmas this year because of his wife's treatment but he wants his daughter to still enjoy the holiday so he asked his ex? Why are so many other commenters assuming he wants free childcare and that the original break up was his fault? It's far more likely he's a father at his wits end with stress who can't afford to host Christmas due to the cost and emotional toll of his wife's cancer treatments, who is reaching out for support from someone he thought could help. He cried to his ex because he is going through something horrid, not because he is emotionally manipulating her, and OP just shut him down and walked away which was damn cold however you want to spin it.

It was such a fun year - very untraditional for our family, we laughed so much because it was so much like \u201cthere was an attempt\u201d. \nI enjoy doing all the Christmas stuff so I do it (we only do one gift now and pick names so it\u2019s not about gifts to us)  but when I was sick they did Christmas so we could still have the experience.  \n\nI personally couldn\u2019t imagine sending my child away in Christmas especially if my husband was sick\u2026. I would step up and make it a fun time no matter what. \n\nMy Brother died when I was 13,  my parents didn\u2019t want to celebrate Christmas 3 months later but they did it for us kids, it would have been really easy to stop celebrating or send us kids to other places that year because of how painful and difficult it was (my brother was 20 when he committed his death).    \n\nI\u2019m really having a hard time with the dad not stepping up for his daughter, even if mom is in the hospital you bring a small celebration to mom (if she\u2019s able) and you do a special Christmas with your child.   If mom is terminal what does he do when she\u2019s gone?\n\nMaybe there is another reason other than being inept \u2026 I truly hope so because otherwise this dad is unworthy of being a parent.", "That\u2019s literally just one example. Some people cannot be around people due to radiation.  Some people are stuck in the hospital. Some people are healing from surgery.  We have no clue what the situation is.  All we know from the facts given are the ex is trying to find some kind of holiday celebration for his daughter so she\u2019s not having to deal with a sick mom and no Christmas.  I think any adult that doesn\u2019t have compassion for a 5yr old with a mom with cancer at Christmas and can\u2019t celebrate is an asshole.", "I admit I am curious if the mother is an inpatient or oitpatient because most people being treated are outpatients.\nThe only reason my father was technically an inpatient between Monday and Friday while receiving treatment was because of how far away we live from the hospital. And he didn't stay in the hospital itself. They have  residency for people like that across from the hospital.\nSo I guess it all depends on the situation.\nUnfortumately the OP didn't mention.", "Even so, there's no way that Christmas alone at the ex's is the only solution. Least of all the best one available. The whole thing is a sad situation for all involved.", "I do understand all of that. Truly. But even if they can't be physically together there are have to be better alternatives like you said. Other support networks. There are hospital advocates, chaplains, social workers, etc to help navigate these things. To help offer advice and support as well as even Christmas opportunities especially for loved ones of terminally ill patients. Why not reach out to those, especially way before the ex? Why not try to compromise for a couple hours the night before or in the morning with the 13 year old for a small exchange and hot cocoa? FaceTime or watch party or mutual crafts? Or even celebrating together on a different day when she is not radioactive and in a better disposition if possible? It is not the exact day that makes the holiday. It's the love.", "Which is also so shitty! He should talk to the hospital chaplains and cancer advocates,  reach out to the local churches or communities or any of the many organizations whose sole purpose is helping families in need and families/loved ones of terminal patients where their entire goal is to support them.

If he can have the forethought to ask his ex he can make a few calls to these places to help better provide a special time for his wife and child and himself.", "Maybe he is just trying to get her away from the ugliness that is happening to her mother so if she passes, Christmas can still be a happy memory for her. Not become about sickness and death.

How is OP saying no, 'punishing' the child who should have maternal, paternal grandparents aunts uncles cousins friends of the family, who she knows?\n\nA five year old, spending days amongst strangers over a family holiday, whilst her mother is sick, is more along the lines of punishing than OP not agreeing.", "Oh please.\n\nYou know what's even worse? Not being able to be with her either of her parents for Christmas, instead being with strangers, and no one telling her why. It will be a negative memory to the kid even if OP let her come.", "OP says her Christmas is sacred family time.  \n\nOoohhhh, the irony. \n\nSeriously what would Jesus do? Include the 5 year half sister to her daughter whose mother has cancer or kick her out saying \"sacred family-only time!\"\n\nThat line lost me there. Couldn't take the rest of it seriously.", "That's what I was assuming from the way the ex asked. It didn't seem like he wanted to send his daughter away,  but this was the best option he could come up with.

I\u2019ve dealt with children around sick people and sometimes it is not always cuddling in a hospital bed watching Christmas movies.

This is an opportunity to show your child strength and kindness. Don\u2019t waste it on being selfish and bitter. Yta if you don\u2019t welcome that little girl into your home this Christmas.

So I'm going to go against the grain here and say YTA, big time. The child is 5 years old; she needs as many loving people around her as possible right now. She's losing her mom to cancer!!!! If your ex came to you asking for help because -- for whatever reason -- she cannot be around her mom during treatment at the holidays, then I'd trust that he had some valid reasons. And who are you to question it??? Wow, this is horrible, you have \"scared traditions\"??? Give me a break, what about kindness and generosity and love? Are those part of your sacred traditions? You don't know this child well, sure, but she's FIVE YEAR OLD. Let me say that again. She's FIVE. And she's losing her mom, and she's your daughter's sister. And you tell me that your relative will feel uncomfortable around a FIVE YEAR OLD??? Let's stop a minute and think , really think about what the kind, charitable, loving thing to do would be. Refuse a child in need or welcome her into your home with open arms. Where is the downside to that? Some ADULTS might feel slightly uncomfortable. For fucks sakes, reddit can be so awful sometimes. You, my dear, are an asshole.", "Yes, you're the asshole. Fuck, HUGELY. Wow.

You\u2019re weird OP.", "Petty and cruel are you the OP for punishing the child because of her circumstances.  Unless this child is \u201cthe affair child\u201d, I don\u2019t see as a mother how you would do this to another child already probably scared because she doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on and what\u2019s going to happen with these big changes in her life.\nYou say that Christmas is sacred to you.  This leading me to believing you are a Christian woman.  Ask yourself if you believe to be a good Christian woman how you reconcile with your god for your decision. Ask yourself how your daughters perception of you will be effected by this decision?  Your daughter understands, and your daughter might just judge you more harshly than your ex.\nI think it probably took a lot of courage for the new husband to ask that you, a mom that owes him nothing, is asking in his time of need. So yes, YTA", "YTA\n\nam absolutely gobsmacked by these responses.

It's Christmas and in my house, anyone and everyone is welcome. My door is always open, especially to someone in need. A 5 year old would make things awkward??

Why not ask your daughter what she thinks? It\u2019s just a bunch of grown adults saying they\u2019d be uncomfortable with a 5 year old there who is technically a sister to your daughter.

This is assuming there is a reason she can't be with her mother, as many others have written about.\n\nBut your daughters family is your family. She is always going to love her sister and want to be close with her. You say you don't want to add new people to your traditional Christmas, but you will have to eventually won't you? Like your daughters partners, which she will want to start bringing within the next ten years. At least her sister will ALWAYS be her sister, there isn't a chance a bad break up etc is going to end that relationship.\n\nI have a half brother who is ten years younger with me, and he is my mums child from her second marriage. My mums culture doesn't do Christmas, but my dads family did. So every year my brother came and celebrated Christmas with his siblings, despite having no relation to the other attendees. Because my dads family are nice people who would rather let us bond with our sibling and let a kid enjoy Christmas, no matter what. When my paternal grandma died that's something I spoke about at her funeral, to say how much I loved her and how grateful she was to welcome others into her family traditions despite having no obligation to do so.", "Totally the asshole.

If not, the following is still with ruminating on:\n\nIt is truly heartless that you would exclude a helpless, blameless 5-year-old child--whose mother is suffering through cancer--from your Christmas celebration.\n\nWhat about your day will be diminished at the inclusion of this child? She is not your obligation, but it is really saddening and surprising to me that you don't *feel* any sense of obligation to be kind and generous here. The happiness of this 5-year-old aside, it would make *your daughter* happy. Why isn't that worth something?\n\nIf you celebrate Christmas in a religious way, then you are seriously lacking in your understanding about what the purpose of this season is, and you certainly aren't behaving in a Christ-like way. Generosity, charity, unconditional kindness, and grace--those are the values that you should be seeking to emulate here, and it should be made all the easier because, again, we're talking about including a 5-year-old girl, the sister to your daughter, in a one-day celebration. It costs you nothing, it takes nothing from you. Love and kindness are not limited in quantity, in jeopardy of being depleted if you love/are kind to too many people.\n\nI have had countless friends, loose acquaintances, and outright strangers at my home on Christmas. I literally cannot imagine a scenario where I would exclude a child like this. And I definitely don't understand why you or your family would feel uncomfortable including her.\n\nYou should do some serious self-reflection about the kind of person that you want to be. This is really disappointing.", "Just a question you can ask yourself: If this wasn't your ex's kid, but a friend of your daughter, would you still say no?\n\nMaybe that answer will tell you what you want to know.\n\nI lean towards NAH, as you have every right to say no, she is not your responsibility. But I also can't fault a father for wanting to give his young daughter a better christmas and some distraction", "Wow.

If it ends up being terminal, wouldn't it be better to be with her mom and dad than with her dad's ex wife's family\n\nI'm not advocating for OP's ex request. but one answer to your question could be that since last moments of cancer can be really though on the patient, they choose to avoid having loved ones (or at least children) in order to prevent the \"last moments\" be too traumatic. in order for the last memories together to be as good as possible (specially if they already had \"the talk\"). \n\nfor example, it was that case when my father died from lung cancer, I did not see him his last days, but with time I've come to peace with it and understood his position.", "If Mom is in radiation, she may not be safe.  If she's on chemo, she can sweat out the chemicals.

Depending on the stage the cancer is in and how agressive the treatment is, she might also not want the child to see her in that stage, or associate her illness with Christmas. \n\nCancer can be brutal, it can make loved ones nearly unrecognizable, be it physically or mentally - not seeing your mom while she's sick can be traumatizing to children, seeing her in this state can be traumatizing as well, there's no winning in that situation except the hope they'll pull through.\n\nIf she is able to spend Christmas with her child, she should. But people are making an awful lot of assumptions about the dad's intentions here as well - this is a difficult situation, especially if the cancer is terminal (which OP didn't specify, maybe they don't know, but if this conversation has the ex crying it seems fairly likely).   \nBeing around strangers for a family celebration can be scary, especially if your life is falling apart, and I don't think this is the best situation for that child to be in.   \nBut I get wanting to give your child a happy Christmas, surrounded by people laughing and other children, when you feel like you'll break down every second now.", "Her mom is starting cancer treatment at that time\u2026have you ever seen a person going through cancer treatment?

This baby is FIVE, she\u2019s barely out of her toddler/preschool years, at this age Christmas should be about joy, wonder, magic, and love.

But last month his girlfriend gave birth to their second child through emergency c-section in the next city over, and since their older kid, my kid's half-sister, goes to daycare next to my kid's school, I was the one who picked her up (with my kids not to terrorize her because she seems to be convinced that I'm a witch of some sort but she's two) and bring her to the hospital 30 min away to lend a hand to them and allow the kids to meet their baby brother. It's just the right thing to do, this kid and even my kids by extension don't have to suffer from grownups' conflicts.", "Seriously? A person doesn't want to be around or look after their ex's kid and they're treated like this malicious and heartless person?", "I completely agree. I don\u2019t celebrate the holidays but I was raised to extend kindness to people going through tough times. My mom used to cook elaborate dishes for families we knew who had sick family members. They weren\u2019t our family, they weren\u2019t even good friends, and it wasn\u2019t even the holiday season. That\u2019s the kindness I was taught. It\u2019s shocking and disgusting that inviting a 5 year old is too much for OP.", "If I had the chance to help out a FIVE YEAR OLD CHILD at Christmas I\u2019d jump at the opportunity, even if my own child didn\u2019t share any DNA.", "THANK YOU. This poor baby. I would have her over in a second.", "that is my biggest pet peeve about this sub. If everyone in the world functioned the way this sub does, we\u2019d have absolutely zero humanity.", "Honestly if a five year old child even vaguely, tangentially connected to me needed somewhere to spend Christmas under such conditions I would open my home wholeheartedly - let alone my child\u2019s beloved sibling.", ">It's a 5-year-old child and the child is not staying forever. How hard is it to buy some gifts and let the siblings hang out together during a really horrible time?\n\nYeah I'm not seeing how this would create a situation so unpalatable that her family thinks it will somehow ruin the sanctity of their traditional celebration.", "RIGHT?!? \nThe \"I saw he started crying so I took a step back and said I don't feel comfortable in this conversation\" sent me. Heartless miserable people.", "Absolutely! That\u2019s so nice that your dad\u2019s side is so close with your sister.", "This sub has a real \u201cI\u2019m not obligated to help ANYBODY\u201d that is straight up misanthropic sometimes", "Exactly!  We are talking about a five-year-old and I find it hard to believe that OP\u2019s Christmas celebrations are so \u201csacred\u201d that you can\u2019t accommodate a five-year-old child.", "That's what I've been thinking. And his parents are NC with him too (Although there could be many reasons for that)\n\nI seriously smell an affair and that's why OP isn't comfortable around the daughter.", "I\u2019m Canadian so that didn\u2019t enter my mind honestly. My mom had cancer only cost to us was the parking.", "It wouldn't be \"alone\" though, it would be with her sister.", "Being sent away to a place where she is not wanted will also be traumatic. The kid cannot win, but Dad needs to step up parenting and make Christmas as good as it can be, even if that means a Skype call from hospital for Mom. \n\n'Mom is sick and cannot see me' is something the kid will come to terms with. 'Dad didn't want me and made me go and spend Christmas watching everybody fawn over my sister' will create resentment for a very long time.", "I hate Christmas because I associate it with caner and death.  It's when my mom was diagnosed.  Then someone else I was close to died around that time the next year.  I think people are being far too hard on the dad here.", "Being away from a sick parent can also leave mental scars. The worst would be the child leaving and coming back and finding her mother has \u201cdisappeared.\u201d The husband needs to talk to a social worker or therapist - but having JUST gone through something similar, the best would be to celebrate when they can, however they can. A thin sick mommy is still mommy.", "My thoughts exactly.", "yeah agreed. god forbid you do something nice for a 5 year old whose mother may die soon. not sure how some members of this sub exist in society if their first instinct is such breathless cynicism", "Yes, that is what I'm thinking. Someone dying of cancer and the absolutely agonizing process is very traumatic for an adult, I can't imagine for a child.\n\nThe husband is in a difficult position. He needs to get the child out of the the house because what is happening is not fit for a child, he needs to stay because he needs to take care of his wife and he would like for his daughter to be with family she loves so she has something.\n\nTo me, NAH, just a horrible situation.", "I agree with this. I also think he himself may be falling apart and can\u2019t keep up the charade for his girl :/", "I agree- it's OP's wording that has me thinking she's a bit of the AH. People aren't looking at the fact she will be with her half sister, who OP even says are close. Maybe OP should discuss with her daughter how she feels about it? I just think given the circumstances that the family wouldn't mind, and its not about the ex, it's about this kiddo. And yeah, people are saying last Christmas with her, but she may not be healthy enough to be \"present\" and doesn't want that to be one of the  memories her kid has of her.", "True. Yeah of course OP isn\u2019t obligated but isn\u2019t it the season of giving? \n\nI think she should see what her daughter wants. Maybe her daughter will want her sister there, and will be better able to convince her than strangers on the internet", "many people here seem to think the question is \"am i technically or legally obligated?\" instead of \"am i the asshole\"? the answer to the former is no, the answer to the latter is a resounding yes", "A person's child is not that person. Grow up. Also get over your ex at some point.", "She seems pretty heartless because having her daughter's sister at her house for Christmas is somehow a terrible uncomfortable burden on a bunch of other adults that will ruin her family's \"sacred\" Christmas. It's like what eight hours max? A five year will ruin it for everyone?", "sure it's she's their ex's kid but she is also her daughter's beloved little sister whose just started kindergarten and whose mother is dying and father can't keep it together.", "this was what I was looking for also.  \"Sacred,\" huh?  pulling that card in this season is worse than any possibly guilt-tripping the dad (poor distraught dad whose wife is dying, though) was doing.  Not fond of his using the word \"cruel\" but it is rather...unChristmaslike at best.", "I felt the same way about the \u201csacred\u201d part. I assume OP is Christian. Jesus is all about love, compassion, forgiveness, and treating one\u2019s neighbor as thyself. Not seeing any of those traits in OP, honestly.", "I was wondering what that meant too...for at least 6 years the ex was also part of that sacred family time. It would probably help to know why they divorced because OP seems to be holding into a lot of baggage.", "Exactly! I was going to put in my yta response that if they revere Jesus then he wouldn't be coming to their house because there's no kindness and openness and love there for a 5 year old child whose mama is very very sick.", "You\u2019re quite right. And I truly do not understand why. Not everyone is on the take. And often being kind and generous repays you tenfold in other ways.", "But don't you see???  Having some other kid there that's not related to anyone, oops, is only half-related to one of the kids, is SO unpalatable that her family thinks it will somehow ruin the sanctity of their traditional celebration! And how dare she be a Debbie Downer!  /end sarcasm mode", "Yeah, and OP only mentions that the little girl is adored by sister but doesn't come to their house and it doesn't seem like OP and ex have much of a talking relationship if he asked to talk to her, kinda seems like it's only about their shared child (which makes sense).\n \nAnd for it not to be a discussion about it, like what about the current wife's family or any of his/her adult siblings?", "People forget NAH exists as an option", "Men tend to get the shit end of the stick on this sub - Always assume the worst about their intentions and actions. This definitely didn\u2019t read to me as someone who was being manipulative or trying to get his ex to buy his daughter presents because he was too lazy to plan. When my husband was going through cancer treatment, just getting to the grocery store was an accomplishment for me with everything that was going on. We barely did anything for the holidays or birthdays and our anniversary was spent hovering near the bathroom at home. It genuinely seems like this dad is just trying to give his daughter a happy Christmas and it\u2019s sad people can\u2019t give this situation a little grace or understanding. I would host the girl.", "Agreed. I can\u2019t even keep reading anymore (my mom died of cancer. ITS FUCKING HARD OK??? like shit\u2026)", "Okay but \"where she is not wanted\" is up to the adults, who alll should be perfectly capable of being kind and giving to a five year old during a Christmas celebration right? It's only traumatic if the other adults involved make it traumatic rather than idk embracing the whole reason for the season??", "Holidays are about family, not kids; a small girl surrounded by strangers and probably already stressed with her mom being sick is only going to be a bad time for everyone involved - she deserves to be with her mom.", "The holidays are about love and caring, friends and family. Children are an important part of that, but it\u2019s also very valuable for adults. Age doesn\u2019t decrease your need for connection and love. \n\nAnd getting presents from strangers while your parents aren\u2019t around hardly qualifies as a \u201cnormal Christmas\u201d. I doubt being with a sister and with strangers would be better for a five year old than being with her parents.", "No, the holidays are not just about kids. There are no kids in my family, but we try to have a good time together. And if families with kids are invited that's nice too but it's possible to be into the holidays and do it up without children", "Well with one child away from her happy family circle and just inserted into another dynamic - it could be an intimidating and not great experience for the five-year-old? I mean, I always knew when my parents weren't around when I was five?", "But it might open the door to ex asking for more. He might keep asking OP to watch the kid now that the initial awkwardness is over. If OP doesn\u2019t want that, it\u2019s better that she shuts that down now.", "I agree, I'm having a hard time seeing anyone as TA in this situation.\n\nAlthough the \"our family's tradition is sacred and I don't feel like including anyone else\" just on the surface seems kind of touchy to me, especially when it's a child involved who is the half sister of the daughter. Maybe my family is strange but we 100% would have welcomed the kid with open arms. The more the merrier. We've had co-workers living away from their home countries, boyfriends, girlfriends, friends and their kids, neighbors, etc. all join us for Christmas. This Thanksgiving we have 7 people from the other side of the family who are in town for a funeral that weekend joining us for Thanksgiving dinner. They asked for recommendations for a restaurant and we of course invited them to join us instead, if they wanted. \n\nI feel like there's got to be a way to compromise that will benefit the children - have the family thing in the morning and welcome the other child to join for the afternoon? Then the child could see her mother, if possible, in the morning but still have a more \"normal\" experience of a Christmas meal and hanging out with her sister having some fun.", "This is so lovely. Thank you for everything you do, you\u2019re bringing people light in their darkest days and that\u2019s so admirable!", "i gave birth to my kid a few months ago and i was only allowed one support person because of covid restrictions, and they could only leave and come back one time each day. i wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they\u2019re not allowing multiple visitors.\n\nhonestly i don\u2019t get the vitriol and wild speculation about the dad. it sounds like he\u2019s desperate to create a good holiday experience for his kid, not that he intentionally wants to keep her away from mom. i find it weird that OP asks why the kid can\u2019t be with her grandparents but never asks why she can\u2019t be with mom - suggests to me that OP already knows why, and it\u2019s something dad has no control over.", "Father should ask his wife family to help them in this hard moments, if he's NC with his family he should start to think about it again because he NEEDS help and his ex is NOT responsible for HIS and HIS WIFE child.", "And? Should OP also step up and become a maternal figure for \"her daughter's beloved little sister\" should the girl's mother die? Maybe she should start a college fund for her while she's at it. \n\nIt would be nice if OP did let the girl celebrate with them, but she doesn't have to. She's not a terrible person if she doesn't because that kid is ultimately his ex's problem. OP's only obligation to helping her ex with anything is when it's directly related to her daughter.", "That's what I was saying about other extended family. Like, where's mom's family? Is she also NC or has no family too? Is OP really a last resort and now she's heartless for holding a boundary that she's been keeping this whole time??", "True that, this is a clear example of it imo.", "I\u2019m usually the first to pipe up about a man not doing his fair share but damn, these comments are beyond me. Like the dude can\u2019t even hold it together while he\u2019s asking op for help, I cannot get how people read that and think \u201cmaster manipulator\u201d", "At five I was perfectly capable of distinguishing \u2018these people are polite\u2019 from \u2018these people are enthusiastic and actually like me\u2019 and people not meeting me where I was (like the neighbours who insisted on a visit from Santa when I didn\u2019t believe in Santa) made me uncomfortable. (In retrospect, I can see the kindness. At five, I didn\u2019t.) \n\nAnd none of those people can be a substitute for Mom and Dad, for being sent away at Christmas. Ex needs to step up and give his daughter a good Christmas. The spirit of the season is making sure she has time and memories with her mom, over Skype if necessary; and bonding time with dad.", "Oh 100%  but this little girl isn't JUST OP's ex's kid. It's her daughter's family and this poor little girl is in a shitstorm before they can tie their shoes. While OP isn't necessarily in the wrong, this is a young child that is important to the daughter we're talking about..", "I hope you didn't pull your hamstring with that stretch.\n\nWe're talking spending Christmas Day with her sister not OP adopting her.", "I meant for the child to do with her mom if her mom is trapped in the hospital without visiting options. I think that OP should consider getting the girls together during the Christmas holidays if ex is not up to hosting, but the trouble is, it sets an expectation. The ex sounds like someone who will impose as much as he\u2019s able, and once there is a precedence, he\u2019ll keep pushing OP to take on a parental role/responsibility for his child with another woman because it\u2019s more convenient for him. I know that\u2019s a jump, but the man did try to get OP to agree to host his daughter and assumed he would be there as well.", "People on this subreddit don't give a shit about stuff like that. \n\nI swear (I apparently have too much time on my hands) in every thread about half-siblings... people are like: \"They're not blood, they mean nothing to you!!\".\n\nAnd every time it's like: \"But even if they're not your direct family, they're still family to your kid/grandkid\". \n\nAdults shouldn't ever be the issue putting things inbetween child siblings.", "Yes. Any activities should be at the 5yos home or the hospital. OP should not be hosting anything.\n\nHelping the 13yo to make some memories would be kind especially since it seems like the father is not going to do anything."]}
