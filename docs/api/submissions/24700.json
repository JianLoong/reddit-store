Sometimes I feel like my actions are justified while at other times I feel like I\u2019m just plain wrong.\n\nMy brothers, sisters, and I do not have a great relationship. We\u2019re all low or no contact with each other. I have a great job that pays very well while they\u2019re barely making minimum wage or living of their spouses. During our parents last years, I was the only one in a position to help them. I paid for whatever care they needed and made sure they were comfortable. My siblings sometimes visited our parents but none contributed to their care. I also paid the taxes and maintenance of their house. We never discussed their wills beyond them letting me know they existed. When our dad passed, he left everything to our mom. When she passed, I was shocked.\n\nI thought the estate would be divided equally between the children but instead, the bulk of the estate (almost all of it is in the house) was left to my siblings. My portion was a minority (5%) ownership in their house. Mom wrote letters to all of us and in her letter to me, she thanked me for taking care of her and explained that she left me so little because I didn\u2019t really need it while my siblings need all of the help she could give them.\n\nThe shock turned into hurt as I did more for my parents than everyone else. My siblings immediately wanted to sell the house to cash out . I don\u2019t know the market value but the tax value is about $750,000. My siblings are begging me to agree to sell or buy them out because they can\u2019t afford their portion of the taxes (including their huge estate tax bills coming up) and maintenance, and they can\u2019t afford to buy me out. I\u2019ve done fine before the measly inheritance so I won\u2019t miss it. On the other hand, my siblings want to move out of their apartments or pay for their kid\u2019s braces or some other sappy excuse. One even said his wife\u2019s car is dying and they currently can\u2019t afford a new car.\n\nMy wife understand my hurt but she said I\u2019m taking it too far. My siblings alternate between begging and cussing at me. \n\nYou decide.\n\nEdit to answer questions:\n\nIt\u2019s not about the money. If my mom left me the entire estate, it still wouldn\u2019t be enough to cover the cost of what I spent on their health care, groceries, funeral costs, and not to mention all of the bills related to the house. I spent that money with the full understanding that none of it was coming back because they were my parents. The hurt comes from the nominal amount.\n\nMy end game? On good days I don\u2019t know what my end game is. On bad days I\u2019m willing to go scorch earth and let the city auction off the house for unpaid taxes. Before my mom passed, the roof was leaking and I got estimates that ranged from $25,000-30,000 to fix the rotted wood then replace the shingles. She went downhill so I just forgot about it but now I\u2019m willing to let it collapse into itself. There\u2019s no way my siblings can come up with the money to fix the roof much less pay the taxes.", "created_utc": 1692109216, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ru355/aita_for_causing_my_siblings_to_lose_massive/", "score": 2541, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You might be able to challenge the estate to pay back the bills for your parents care. Nobody could blame you for that. You should definitely be able to get your tax money back from the house. But IANAL and do not know where you live to know that for sure. This is going to ruin your relationship with your siblings but it doesn't sound like you actually care that much. You might even be able to challenge the whole will. From being in this sub I've learned that certain countries it doesn't matter what's in the will, their laws overrule it.\n\nThe thing is no matter what you do, you're never going to be able to look at your mother and say this is unfair... Why did you do this to me? Why does me caring for you put me at the bottom of the totem pole? \n\nYeah what she did was really messed up! Hell what they did was really messed up by not helping you care for your parents even if it was only physically & not monetarily. But what is your end game here? Are you hoping the house gets taken for taxes because your siblings can't pay their portion? Are you hoping to put them into debt over taxes so when they finally sell the house they hardly get anything out of it? At some point you need to give up and walk away just to save your own sanity! \n\nI don't even know that I can pass judgment here because as the one who does the most for my mom and stepdad and also the one that makes the most money, I would still be hurt! I absolutely get what you're going through, because it's the point and the snub not the money. Good luck to you.", "Nta you have every right to be upset. Your parents used you as an atm to finance their retirement and didn\u2019t have the decency to even pay you back in their death. Your nothing but an atm for them, \n\nNow your siblings have the financial means to make this up. But instead they are just as bad. Because why the hell should they pay you back you can afford the loss. You can but it\u2019s the lack of respect that they care so little to do the right thing.\n\nI would talk to a lawyer. Take all the tax receipts, anything you have record of buying for your parents and put it against the estate to get paid back for the financial help you gave them. Then take your 5 percent. From the sale and cut ties.\n\nYou deserve to at least recover the amount of financial aid you gave your parents. You should not cover the blunt of the financial burden when they had 3 kids. So take the money out of the estate with putting a claim in. \n\nWhen your siblings come knocking at your door tell them your no longer the family bank. You will not be providing any financial aid to anyone else. You refuse to be used and discarded like trash.\n\n\nBefore you decide to do anything speak to your own attorney. See if there is a way you can recoup your losses. You should not take a financial hit. Make sure your getting as much back as you possibly can before you agree to do anything. Your own attorney is the best way to start.", "I was in the same situation- I felt they stole from my kids  and gave it to my siblings and their kids. But at the end of the day, we are more than fine financially compared to my siblings families. So my best advice is let it go. In fact, refuse the 5% and give it to them and wash your hands of the whole thing. Move forward -and seek out therapy to let go of your hurt feelings and resentments.", "The question here isn't \"Is your Mom an asshole for her terrible inheritance plan\" but \"AITA for \\~checks notes\\~ blocking the cash-out of your mom's house out of pettiness.\n\nYes, YTA. \n\nYou have every right to be angry about the situation from your mom, and perhaps your siblings don't deserve the income.

Your mom is where your anger should be pointed, not your siblings.", "So what's your objective in refusing to sell?  Why are you doing it?

OK, you're angry, and you've got a right to be.  So now what?  Do you just screw your siblings, with little or no benefit to yourself?  It's too late to express your hurt to your mother.  Just lashing out at your siblings with no purpose beyond \"I'm hurt so now I want other people to hurt, too\" is an AH move.", "YTA- I\u2019m sorry man, this sucks. But for what you are asking you are. You have a 5% stake in the house, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019ll be easy for them to get the executor to force the sale of the house. \n\nWhat is your plan? If you want to live there you\u2019ll have to pay them rent anyways or buy them out. 95% of the house owners want to sell- they\u2019ll get it sold but with a lot of bad blood. \n\nYour mom left a poor thanks for all your help, but it\u2019s not their fault.

Taxes, insurance whatever. Have your siblings sign a contract to pay you back from the sale proceeds. Plus you 5%.", "YTA \n\nBut mainly to yourself. It doesn't sound like you want or need an ongoing relationship with your siblings. It doesn't sound like it's a great relationship.

It's understandable why your parents made the choice they did, it's also understandable that you feel hurt an let down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBUT - it's your mum, not your siblings, that caused this. Don't punish them for her failure to talk to you or to consider how this would make you feel.\n\n\\- get some advice .

I'd be pissed too if I had financially supported my parents and then basically got told \"sucks to be you\"", "This is a situation where I feel you are justifiably the asshole... and that's okay. What your parents did to you was shameful. You are being punished for working hard, and for taking care of them. That is a slap in the face. If your siblings want to sell it quicker, they can offer you more percentage, or spend the money on lawyers to force the sale. Either way, I wouldn't bend because they want. Hell, not one of them seems to be acknowledging how unfair it was to you. They only care about themselves, so I wouldn't lift a finger for them if I were you.

However, the rest of the fam is not to blame for this. And their reasons for needing money are totally legit. Sorry to say, boo, you need to sell the house.

It sounds like your siblings couldn\u2019t help out not because they didn\u2019t want to, but because they couldn\u2019t afford to, and you can\u2019t expect them to contribute what you can if they\u2019re in a lower income bracket. Now you\u2019re trying to screw them over just because you\u2019re bitter.

I understand wanting to explore some kind of compensation for all you did, but don't just block it to be petty. If you don't care, then don't care.

I\u2019ve done fine before the measly inheritance so I won\u2019t miss it. On the other hand, my siblings want to move out of their apartments or pay for their kid\u2019s braces or some other sappy excuse. One even said his wife\u2019s car is dying and they currently can\u2019t afford a new car.\n\nMy wife understand my hurt but she said I\u2019m taking it too far.
