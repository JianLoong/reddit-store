We never discussed their wills beyond them letting me know they existed. When our dad passed, he left everything to our mom. When she passed, I was shocked.\n\nI thought the estate would be divided equally between the children but instead, the bulk of the estate (almost all of it is in the house) was left to my siblings. My portion was a minority (5%) ownership in their house.

You might be able to challenge the estate to pay back the bills for your parents care. Nobody could blame you for that. You should definitely be able to get your tax money back from the house. But IANAL and do not know where you live to know that for sure. This is going to ruin your relationship with your siblings but it doesn't sound like you actually care that much. You might even be able to challenge the whole will. From being in this sub I've learned that certain countries it doesn't matter what's in the will, their laws overrule it.\n\nThe thing is no matter what you do, you're never going to be able to look at your mother and say this is unfair... Why did you do this to me? Why does me caring for you put me at the bottom of the totem pole? \n\nYeah what she did was really messed up! Hell what they did was really messed up by not helping you care for your parents even if it was only physically & not monetarily. But what is your end game here? Are you hoping the house gets taken for taxes because your siblings can't pay their portion? Are you hoping to put them into debt over taxes so when they finally sell the house they hardly get anything out of it? At some point you need to give up and walk away just to save your own sanity! \n\nI don't even know that I can pass judgment here because as the one who does the most for my mom and stepdad and also the one that makes the most money, I would still be hurt! I absolutely get what you're going through, because it's the point and the snub not the money. Good luck to you.", "Nta you have every right to be upset. Your parents used you as an atm to finance their retirement and didn\u2019t have the decency to even pay you back in their death. Your nothing but an atm for them, \n\nNow your siblings have the financial means to make this up. But instead they are just as bad. Because why the hell should they pay you back you can afford the loss. You can but it\u2019s the lack of respect that they care so little to do the right thing.\n\nI would talk to a lawyer. Take all the tax receipts, anything you have record of buying for your parents and put it against the estate to get paid back for the financial help you gave them. Then take your 5 percent. From the sale and cut ties.\n\nYou deserve to at least recover the amount of financial aid you gave your parents. You should not cover the blunt of the financial burden when they had 3 kids. So take the money out of the estate with putting a claim in. \n\nWhen your siblings come knocking at your door tell them your no longer the family bank. You will not be providing any financial aid to anyone else. You refuse to be used and discarded like trash.\n\n\nBefore you decide to do anything speak to your own attorney. See if there is a way you can recoup your losses. You should not take a financial hit. Make sure your getting as much back as you possibly can before you agree to do anything. Your own attorney is the best way to start.", "I was in the same situation- I felt they stole from my kids  and gave it to my siblings and their kids. But at the end of the day, we are more than fine financially compared to my siblings families. So my best advice is let it go. In fact, refuse the 5% and give it to them and wash your hands of the whole thing. Move forward -and seek out therapy to let go of your hurt feelings and resentments.", "The question here isn't \"Is your Mom an asshole for her terrible inheritance plan\" but \"AITA for \\~checks notes\\~ blocking the cash-out of your mom's house out of pettiness.\n\nYes, YTA. \n\nYou have every right to be angry about the situation from your mom, and perhaps your siblings don't deserve the income.

OK, you're angry, and you've got a right to be.  So now what?  Do you just screw your siblings, with little or no benefit to yourself?  It's too late to express your hurt to your mother.  Just lashing out at your siblings with no purpose beyond \"I'm hurt so now I want other people to hurt, too\" is an AH move.", "YTA- I\u2019m sorry man, this sucks. But for what you are asking you are. You have a 5% stake in the house, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019ll be easy for them to get the executor to force the sale of the house. \n\nWhat is your plan? If you want to live there you\u2019ll have to pay them rent anyways or buy them out. 95% of the house owners want to sell- they\u2019ll get it sold but with a lot of bad blood. \n\nYour mom left a poor thanks for all your help, but it\u2019s not their fault.

It doesn't sound like you want or need an ongoing relationship with your siblings. It doesn't sound like it's a great relationship.

What your parents did to you was shameful. You are being punished for working hard, and for taking care of them. That is a slap in the face. If your siblings want to sell it quicker, they can offer you more percentage, or spend the money on lawyers to force the sale. Either way, I wouldn't bend because they want. Hell, not one of them seems to be acknowledging how unfair it was to you. They only care about themselves, so I wouldn't lift a finger for them if I were you.

However, the rest of the fam is not to blame for this. And their reasons for needing money are totally legit. Sorry to say, boo, you need to sell the house.

Sure your parents could\u2019ve (and should\u2019ve) rewarded you more for helping them, but as you said, you don\u2019t really need it. It sounds like your siblings couldn\u2019t help out not because they didn\u2019t want to, but because they couldn\u2019t afford to, and you can\u2019t expect them to contribute what you can if they\u2019re in a lower income bracket. Now you\u2019re trying to screw them over just because you\u2019re bitter.

I understand wanting to explore some kind of compensation for all you did, but don't just block it to be petty. If you don't care, then don't care.

YTA", "But trying to contest the will to take money that now belongs to the siblings (who seem to be in a position where they really need it) is the bigger asshole move really.\n\nOP doesn't need the money, and didn't expect it to be repaid until he found out his share of the inheritance.\n\nRemember, this is r/amitheasshole, not r/legaladvice\n\nAnd OP is definitely TA, even if he got stiffed by his parents.", "I would. If I took a thousand dollar lose! They would not profit from it. I take a total loss so could they. \n\nBut I know I am petty asshole! I can live with being a petty asshole. The absolute best part of being a petty asshole is no one screws you over including family because you would not show them any mercy.", "They have to go to court. \n\nVerbal agreements exist. There are 3 people who agreed to this 2 can\u2019t testify. He has proof he paid the taxes for years. In some states paying taxes on property\u2019s enough for you to take ownership.\n\nHe could drag this in court.", "Proof it. As someone said it wasn\u2019t written. And I am sure he has bank receipts.\n\n\nPlus in some states. Adverse procession laws exists. He could take owner ship by proving he paid the taxes. \n\nEither way he doesn\u2019t need the money. He can afford to wait them out.", "He can contest the will. But mom made her feeling quite clear.", "Yeah avoiding it all together is a headache. This way he gets to recover some of the financial loss of helping his ungrateful parents. \nJust in taxes alone op probably spent $100,000. If it wasn\u2019t for him. There be no house to inherit.\n\n\nThen he can cut contact with the siblings. It be done and over.", "I am a house wife. But if my family was needing the money I go to work tomorrow. \n\nBeing a sham is a luxury not a right. If you can\u2019t afford to don\u2019t expect other to finance. And don\u2019t come at me and say well child care cost ,\nMore. Find a job and you and your husband work different shirts. That away someone is always with the kids.", "Or househusband - yeah probably.. but if the kids are at braces age then they could prob work for what they need to pay for.\nOP shouldn\u2019t be penalised financially or, more importantly, emotionally, because his siblings didn\u2019t make choices that they could afford", "Or 3 he can tie this up.  Seek a lawyer. If he has proof he paid the taxes. Money from his bank account. His mommy\u2019s nice little letter. He can force the, to reimburse him from the estate. My guess giving how much the house is worth. Between maintenance and taxes. Op could sue the estate easy $200,000. Plus still get his whopping 5 percent.\n\nMy guess his siblings don\u2019t have money to fight the suit. If they do fight it it will eat away at their inheritance.\n\nPlus some states and country\u2019s their is a little law of adverse position where if you paid property taxes, and unkept the property you can file for ownership of the property. Each state is different in some states paying the property tax could be enough.\n\nBut he should seek legal advice!", "What did his siblings do? Being poor while wanting a child to have orthodontic treatment hardly qualifies as suck behavior. Frankly, from how petty and vindictive OP is, I\u2019d think the poor sibling relationship is at least partly (if not entirely) on OP.", "\"What was OP doing through childhood\"\n\nIf you think that arguments gonna fly in this website of all places you are funny. \n\nOne last time for the ones in the back, parents are not owed for your upbringing, they choose to bring a life to this world, it is only fair they give said life the best they have.", "Yup. He knew there was a will but never asked about it. Just pretended to be the noble son helping out- when really it sounds like he was expecting his pay day.", "Why would you punish your siblings for being poor because mom favoured them in the will?", " Verbal agreements related to real property are generally not enforceable.   His paying the taxes does not entitle him to ownership.  Acquiring property through a delinquent tax sale and waiting out the redemption period is entirely different than a child voluntarily paying property taxes on their parents\u2019 home and then throwing a fit afterwards. \n\nHe won\u2019t even get past a motion to dismiss.", "What states would those be? Because that doesn't exist in the US anywhere that I know of. I worked mortgages at a national level.", "Yes he can prove he helped his mom out. And that may help him if he contests. \n\nBut the sibs with the majority stake can also force the sale anyways.  The question though is- AITA for screwing over his siblings who need the money from the sale of the house by using his mini stake to try and stall it. \n\nAnd yes, he is pissed at his dead mother and being a dick. He could also TALK to them about getting a more decent stake in the house. Or he could cause them to loose it all to a tax sale.", "Well then you should stop living off of your husband. Because the OP thinks that's what you're doing. \n\nYou can diminish the role all you want and talk about it being a luxury but there's nothing luxurious about being a housewife unless you have a bunch of cleaners, cooks, gardeners and a live in nanny. \n\nChildcare is the tip of the iceberg.", ">Being a sham is a luxury not a right\n\nTotally depends on the situation. I've known multiple people who did the match and realized that the costs of daycare would be more than they were making at their job, so they couldn't afford NOT to be a SAHM. The sibling in question most likely isn't choosing staying at home over a $100k per year job, it's very possible that they'd be making minimum wage", "His mother is the one who made that insult and unfortunately for the OP her word is law in that will.\n\nMy point is the OP is being an elitist to his siblings by diminishing their worth in these ways. So he is an unreliable narrator. \n\nThe probate court will solve this and unfortunately for him he might end up paying their legal fees in the end. \ud83d\ude2c", "Okay we don't have enough info on the siblings to know if they suck or not.  However, I know that if my sibling had financially assisted my parents a lot more than I could, and they left me the greater inheritance, I'd probably talk to them and try to make it right.", "Because the siblings know he saved the house. They don\u2019t have any respect or decency to pay him back for the taxes and maintenances! They expect him to take hundreds of thousand dollar loss!\n\nIf they over to take what he spent just in taxes and maintenance and split it 3 ways. Pay their share. Then moms just the asshole that used him. \n\nBut since they haven\u2019t offered that and expect him to take the loss. They are now the greedy assholes. If it wasn\u2019t for op there would not be a house. Instead of being appreciative and offering to help op recoup. \n\nThen they can loose too.", "I am not diminishing the roll. I have been sahm for 30 plus years. But at any point if I had to I would have went back to work.\n\nI still stay at home but I don\u2019t work. I take care of my husbands parents.", "Well as others have pointed out in this thread, OP has options to contest this will and also possibly redeem expenses they paid for the parents when they were alive.", "I agree but the siblings do have options to right that wrong..", "He isn\u2019t asking them to pay taxes- he\u2019s saying they can\u2019t pay the current taxes on the property. If they don\u2019t sell they have no money. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t even say if he asked them to split the house more equally. OP says he got a crap 5% from his mother. The others want to sell because they can\u2019t afford the up keep and they need the money. \n\nSo OP wants to be a dick and refuse the sale. Well he can\u2019t. And he is the asshole for screwing his siblings because he\u2019s mad at mommy.", "Perhaps but if he spends his time purposefully reducing the value of the asset this can seriously turn around on him. He needs legal counsel immediately if he wants to play games.\n\nAlso it's not stated if there is a no contest clause in the will that could actually lose him everything and then some. Those are becoming more common as people are getting more vulture-y about inheritance.", "Yeah but at this point he shooting himself in the foot. Because probate courts will often make the contesting party who loses pay for the others legal fees. \ud83d\ude10", "I\u2019ve no idea about probate law, my judgement is based on who is the asshole not who is legally covered", "We disagree on who's the a****** in this situation. But He's just adding potential injury to insult, he needs a lawyer if he's going to play this game.", "Well I hope he gets a good one and it works out in his favour as best it can"]}
