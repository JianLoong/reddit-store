In the early days of our relationship, most of his sleep talk involved talking with his co-workers (I say co-workers, but they were being paid to study for their career). He always woke me up (light sleeper), and while he always apologised for keeping me awake and I knew he couldn't control it, it still would piss me off, especially when I had already been having trouble sleeping cause of health issues. Instead of being pissed at hubby, i decided that if his work colleagues were pissing him off during the day enough for him to be reliving the day in his sleep, then I was going to have some fun and talk back to him as his co workers and make him more pissed off at them. \n\nAfter a few weeks of everyone thinking they were going crazy because hubby was pissed over conversations none of them could remember having, I came clean at a BBQ (they all got together with partners for a birthday BBQ and drinks). When I told them what was happening and why I did it, everyone cracked up laughing cause they found it funny and fair. Plus, they were all impressed that I turned it into a game rather than being pissed at hubby because he was verbally abusing me in his sleep (the first night he told me to f off dreaming I was someone else).\n\nI think anyone who shares a room with a sleep talker/walker needs to be prepared for it to happen, just like snoring, and if the \"culprit\" is aware they need to tell the person before going to sleep. Basically, the first couple of times you share a room with anyone, be wary, don't take anything too personally and if something does happen let the \"sleeper\" know in the morning so that they are aware.

I have to shake her awake. NTA, but maybe next time grab a blanket out before going to bed and putting in on the floor or a chair in your room so if your friend wants another one they can grab it.", "NTA. At least you didn\u2019t bite her while having a dream about eating watermelon\u2026", "My partner is so proficient at sleeptalking and walking that he seems to advance over time. He's done exactly that and worse (kicked a blanket off me then threw it off the bed because he was hot) and while I give him a hard time when he's awake jokingly about how unloved I must be, it really just gets treated like a separate personality. \n\nI've found that I can make requests for him to give blankets back if I push a little harder rather than ask nicely. He can verbally say no, but he really doesn't fight back much if it's between me asking him repeatedly or letting him sleep deeper.\n\nUltimately, that's someone over a decade older than you in a committed relationship, so please understand that it is not a huge deal in the slightest. You were asleep. It's a little funny. Should have been over with a laugh and a half-assed sorry because you're basically not the same person. If there's a next time, keep an extra blanket in your room when someone is over now that you know sleepy you has a mission. \n\nAs a quick side note, over the years sleeping in the same bed as my partner, his asleep personality did get slightly more considerate. So if you think it'll be much of an issue in the future, it really won't. The creepy laughter is definitely more of one.", "You did a poor job at being a host. One of the most standard things to do when having someone stay overnight is to show them where the extra blankets are should they wind up needing them, because they may need a lot more than you. Being hard to wake up doesn't make you an asshole, but laughing at your guest over the fact that you didn't provide enough blankets does.", "When you sleep with someone else, there are bound to be times when someone else hogs the blankets.

You really don't have control over what you do in your sleep unless you can actually do lucid dreaming.\n\nA personal example (not to take away from your experience but to relate): My ex suffered from PTSD, and in their sleep once had a freakout and landed an uppercut on me - I was fast asleep. I was PISSED (and in pain - she's a former MMA competitor) but I didn't hold it against her because I knew she couldn't help the PTSD freakouts.\n\nFollowing up on others and bad moods following dreams: I occasionally have nightmares and night terrors put me into a dreadful mood for the entire day, but acknowledging that the foul mood comes from events in a dream which never happened, helps a great deal in avoiding reflecting/redirecting that anger toward others.", "INFO why did you not already give her a blanket?", "NTA.
