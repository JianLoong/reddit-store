She should have been able to a) find another blanket, or b) find a substitute like some extra clothes or a towel or something.\n\nI understand her thinking in the moment you were being rude, but after you explained you were talking in your sleep, she needed to get over it.", "NTA - maybe she thought you were being rude by laughing? you say crazy stuff when sleep talking it does not come filtered from personal experience\u2026 no further comment on that one\u2026", "not enough info. did you provide her a blanket to sleep with before you fell asleep? did you apologise to her for being unintentionally rude/leaving her to be cold overnight or just explain why it wasn't a problem because you didn't mean it? the impact on her from you being inconsiderate before you were asleep would still make you TA as a host", "NTA.  I say the most random things in my sleep.  Not long ago my partner told me I woke up and asked him why he hurt the butterflies.  I have zero idea what that means.  You weren't awake, had no idea what was going on, and weren't being intentionally rude.", "Wtf? Your friends are weird. NTA.", "If you were honestly asleep with no memory of it and didnt do it intentionally , NTA\n\nthat is funny as all heck though. i would have laughed", "Lol conversations in your sleep don't count. You could've been responding to Godzilla asking for your blanket. There's no telling what was going on in your dream. I've slept through alarms before because the tune became part of the dream.\n\nNta.", "Is she bad tho? If you deny a baddie the right to comfortable sleeping, especially in your own bed (gay or not), you are liable for harsh criticism, negative mood swings, and death. I appreciate the consideration for your friend. NTA", "Assuming you gave her minimal blankets and pillows, NTA. I always find it insane when people try to blame people for sleep actions.", "Nta. If she really needed the blacket she should have asked you after making sure you are actually awake. Some people just will do very random things asleep or even answer to questions so calling you an ah is not something that is in any way sensible thing at that point. She didn't wake you up properly -> not your fault for sleep answering weirdly", "NAH\n\nI can understand her being a little frustrated in being cold given the circumstances, but in the end you were half asleep and obviously didn't understand what was going on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She nursed that grumpiness all day at work because of something that didn't actually happen. \n\nPeople be strange.", "Yes, she was provided with a comforter and a sheet, the same that I had. I was fine all night as well. I did have my fan on, but she did not express being cold before we went to sleep.

In OP's dreamland, they could have been saying no to a talking tree on Planet Zeeboo. Definitely NTA, and the friend should not be upset. Only the tree on Planet Zeeboo should be.", "Show her this thread full of other people who talk in their sleep.

I was fine all night as well.\n\nThat doesn't mean she wasn't cold, though.  I can sleep with twice the number of blankets as my husband because I stay cold, but he overheats, despite the same room temperature.", "fair enough. it probably would have helped to apologise for unintentionally offending her once you knew what happened still, it's not a good reaction to respond to someone being upset/hurt to \"explain\" why their feelings are wrong."]}
