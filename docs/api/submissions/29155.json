I say the most random things in my sleep.  Not long ago my partner told me I woke up and asked him why he hurt the butterflies.  I have zero idea what that means.

If she really needed the blacket she should have asked you after making sure you are actually awake. Some people just will do very random things asleep or even answer to questions so calling you an ah is not something that is in any way sensible thing at that point.

I was fine all night as well. I did have my fan on, but she did not express being cold before we went to sleep. I also gave her a blanket after I explained that I was asleep and therefore did not know both what I was saying or what she was saying.", "I have nonsensical conversations with my husband while he sleeps all the time, he never remembers it.

In OP's dreamland, they could have been saying no to a talking tree on Planet Zeeboo. Definitely NTA, and the friend should not be upset.

I can sleep with twice the number of blankets as my husband because I stay cold, but he overheats, despite the same room temperature.", "fair enough. it probably would have helped to apologise for unintentionally offending her once you knew what happened still, it's not a good reaction to respond to someone being upset/hurt to \"explain\" why their feelings are wrong.", "Ahhh to be 17 again.", "Info: Did you not give them a blanket before you guys went to sleep?", "Obviously not the ahole , maybe your friends are just sensitive and cannot just accept what you told them.

I once stayed at a friend's home for a night and apparently her dog (a huge boxer) came and jumped on top of me during the night and I was pushing him away and saying 'Get off, Buck' over and over again to him. My friend came and dragged him away. She told me about it all in the morning and I was completely unaware of any of it.", "I have full conversations in my sleep with my SO. Sometimes eyes open, Sometimes not.  He's since sent a recap text in the morning so there's a literal record as I have NO recollection of these conversations. \n\nNTA op.

I yelled at her how I knew she had it in the trunk of her car, despite it literally sitting in the corner of my room. In the morning she told me all about it while laughing and asked me what I had been dreaming about. THAT'S how a person reacts to weird sleep-talking...not holding it against you!", "When I was young I fell asleep at church once and started sleep whispering to my mum.

Instead of apologising. I would have apologised, how embarrassing that a guest was cold because I rudely told them no in my sleep. I'd be embarrassed I actually said anything in my sleep but that's just me.", "YTA who doesn\u2019t give a blanket to someone staying the night or making sure there accommodated. If you pulled the blanket to yourself and she tried 5 times, you\u2019re just a terrible sleeper or just didn\u2019t care. Either way I hope you learn from this for future bed shares.", "My partner woke up once asking me to hand him his starfish and was angry when I didn\u2019t understand he really meant his phone. Never held it against him. His new nickname is, however, starfish. \n\nTldr: nta and your friend needs to learn how to wake people up properly", "NTA but my tip for the day is one blanket/duvet per person makes for a more comfortable night.", "Question?\n\nAre Opie's friend serious because this is ridiculous\n\nA clear NTA", "I\u2019m no stranger to people being an AH in their sleep but nowhere does OP mention that they apologized for it and that makes them a bit of an AH.", "My hubby had a sleep over with a friend and hubby's sister also got to have a friend over, hubby's parents heard talking and went to tell them to be quiet and go to sleep only to find out that hubby and my SILs friend were having a conversation across the hall in their sleep.\n\nYears later, and hubby still talks in his sleep (we have been together 14 years). In the early days of our relationship, most of his sleep talk involved talking with his co-workers (I say co-workers, but they were being paid to study for their career). He always woke me up (light sleeper), and while he always apologised for keeping me awake and I knew he couldn't control it, it still would piss me off, especially when I had already been having trouble sleeping cause of health issues. Instead of being pissed at hubby, i decided that if his work colleagues were pissing him off during the day enough for him to be reliving the day in his sleep, then I was going to have some fun and talk back to him as his co workers and make him more pissed off at them. \n\nAfter a few weeks of everyone thinking they were going crazy because hubby was pissed over conversations none of them could remember having, I came clean at a BBQ (they all got together with partners for a birthday BBQ and drinks). When I told them what was happening and why I did it, everyone cracked up laughing cause they found it funny and fair. Plus, they were all impressed that I turned it into a game rather than being pissed at hubby because he was verbally abusing me in his sleep (the first night he told me to f off dreaming I was someone else).\n\nI think anyone who shares a room with a sleep talker/walker needs to be prepared for it to happen, just like snoring, and if the \"culprit\" is aware they need to tell the person before going to sleep. Basically, the first couple of times you share a room with anyone, be wary, don't take anything too personally and if something does happen let the \"sleeper\" know in the morning so that they are aware. (Obviously, this is within reason, I'm not condoning illegal activity like SA). NTA", "I know it seems like a nonsenseto feel this way, but I had a dream like this this week and the emotions and feelings that comes from this are strong and real. You rationally know that it's not reality, but it doesn't make the feelings go away.", "Was it a thick nice comforter or one of those comforters that are fluffy but that weird material thats not really warm?", "If you are upset about someone saying no while sleeping then you should go get checked."]}
