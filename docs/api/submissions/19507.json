Sure. But unless she\u2019s asking for them to change their return policy to accommodate her over $1.25 and she\u2019s just using the return option to return something, you were rude. Wait your turn patiently next time. It doesn\u2019t matter what she\u2019s returning. Mind your own purchase.", "NTA", "YTA. \nThere\u2019s such a thing as common courtesy and being polite.  \nIf she wanted a refund she\u2019s well entitled to a refund. We all get slightly annoyed my minor inconveniences in life but most of us have developed the social skills to not let that annoyance show. \n\nGrow up.", "YTA... leave the old lady alone.  Whenever you go to a store, there is always a chance that someone will return something or slow things down for some reason or another. Why stress everyone out?", "YTA - why is your time more valuable than her money AND time??? It isn\u2019t\u2026. You also have no clue what she\u2019s going through, don\u2019t be rude to people!

This situation sounds annoying, and I might have tempted to roll my eyes if I were in your shoes. Can't imagine why it's necessary to return a $1.00 greeting card. Just the same, it would have been better, more civil, to keep your mouth shut and just suck up the couple of minutes of your life that were being wasted.", "YTA.

She did nothing wrong. You were rude. Don\u2019t want to wait? Put your candy back, and go to another store. As others have pointed out, she may have needed that money for something else.

We all have to wait in line behind people, and if we are carrying heavy things we either get a cart or deal with it. \n\nIt's her dollar and she can go and get in line to get it back if she wants to. Maybe she needs every penny for her budget. Or maybe she doesn't want to waste a it on a card she isn't going to use.

Muahaha!\"", "You wait your turn in line, regardless of what the transaction is ahead of you.  If you were in such a hurry that you couldn't wait for her transaction to be completed, then you could have offered to buy the card off of her for $2 - give her a little profit, get your candy faster, everyone's a winner.

It costs me nothing to prepare, why so many people can't do this is beyond me, they get there and can't find anything so they need their hands held, don't bother to read pricing signs so need their hands held, don't bother to figure their banking out so need to hold the line up figuring shit out, or recklessly impulse buying so returning shit left and right.\n\nCan't wait for digital stores.", "Give her the dollar, or stfu and wait.

People like this annoy me, too. Its unnecessary. I'm not going to hide it. You didnt say anthing rude to her, you just didn't hide your contempt. Maybe if they realised how petty they are being they might stop. Maybe not.", "YTA. Frankly, as some who is in a management position for their job where I DO have to do returns, know this OP: Our job isn't to handle returns. It's to run the store. Sometimes that takes a moment of our times and cannot just immediately drop what we are doing to run to the front to handle a return so you can spend your $5 on candy you yourself admit was an impulse buy as it is. And we are timed on our response to it as well in most settings because the customer is our business. We can't have a job if we don't have customers. So I VERY much doubt you were waiting for very long, leading me to believe that you just didn't want to wait and were, in fact, being rude. Both in regards to your body language (unless you were shifting the weight in your arms to prevent from dropping your things, in which case that is a different story) and the snide, unwarranted comment you made in response to her. Be lucky she chose to disengage from you-you did that in my store and she pressed the matter with me, harassing a guest in the manner you did would result in my asking you to leave my store-without the candy.", "YTA, you don't know her circumstances, some people have to count their money to the penny to make it last.", "YTA - you have no awareness of her financial situation and you don\u2019t know why she changed her mind. Maybe she desperately needed that dollar. We don\u2019t know. Be mindful of other people\u2019s situations.", "YTA.  You had no need to yell at anyone.", "I think YTA i'm afraid. I would never take to another person like this because I'm annoyed I have to wait a bit longer to buy something. You don't know her situation.", "YTA. \n\nPeople generally make a fuss about getting a dollar back when they either think they can\u2019t afford it or are frightened about someone else\u2019s reaction to their spending it. \n\nWhatever it is, a little patience and good manners wasn\u2019t gonna hurt you was it?", "YTA op grow up", "YTA. You were in line to buy candy, not standing in line for the ER, you could wait a few minutes. \n\nIf someone is willing to go through that hassle for a dollar and some change, they probably need that money and deserve some compassion.", "You are indeed the AH. Wait your turn.", "YTA. You have no idea why she was returning the card.  Did you possibly think that maybe the person she bought it for unexpectedly passed away? No? Didn't think so.  I wouldn't want a reminder like that sitting around. Just be nice! You have no idea what anyone else is going through!", "YTA:  we all know times are rough, and we all know seniors are on a fixed income with an even more difficult time of it.  What was the need to shame her for needing her dollar back.  How lucky you are to not need to worry about a single dollar.  Poverty sucks, you don\u2019t need to make it worse.", "OP didn\u2019t say anything until the lady called him rude", "Well said. Also it is a dollar store and maybe that dollar was needed for something else. Some people shop there for monetary convenience and some shop there bc it\u2019s what they can afford.

We never know what another person is going through in life.", "You mean the old lady should leave her alone, right?\n\nOP didn\u2019t say anything until this idiot lady opened her mouth.\n\nNTA.", "OP didn\u2019t say anything until the lady called them rude.

How is that not rude?\n\nDo you live in a strange unreality where rolling your eyes at people and gesticulating like a lunatic over a minor inconvenience is somehow an acceptable way to act like an adult?\n\nBecause it's not. It's how children and teenagers act when they don't get their way.", "OP's 'arms were angry' which (besides being a ridiculous thing to say) likely means she was gesticulating her displeasure, which is in fact rude. If OP made a show of her displeasure with the old lady existing (as op admits to doing), then the old woman was well within her rights to comment on it.\n\nYTA, OP. Maybe if you don't want strangers to call you out you shouldn't behave like a pompous, entitled windbag next time someone dares to be in line in front of you.", "But she admits to indicating her annoyance in her body movement. OP didn\u2019t need to say anything to be rude.", "Non verbal communication is still communication. OP didn't need to do that in the first place. It's immature and selfish. It's dollar store candy. Be patient. Wait your turn. Try some kindness.", "Not sure why you keep commenting the same thing under different people\u2019s comments when you\u2019re getting pretty much the same response every time.", "lol have you ever been in public before???", "Yeah, who cares?", "I read it as being exhausted by having to hold the bags of candy. Which doesn't change the verdict of course.", "If you aren't aware that that's rude, you missed an important part of upbringing.", "Most people.", "I\u2019m aware it\u2019s mildly rude it\u2019s just so fucking minor, every day must be horrific for people being upset by someone rolling their eyes in public"]}
