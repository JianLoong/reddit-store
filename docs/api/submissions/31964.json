Your boss is lucky that things didn\u2019t get worse. \n\nAnd if it\u2019s brought up I would make it clear that he was escalating and insisting on getting your private information.

Bosses that hang their employees out to dry like that and don\u2019t step in are not bosses you should be aiming to please and work for long term. So dust off your resume and give yourself some respect by protecting your boundaries. And once you find a job put in a notice or just quit on the spot. That\u2019s up to you.

Your boss has a duty of care to ensure that their staff are safe and they enabled an antisemitic bigoted AH to spew hate towards you. That is absolutely not OK. I'm a British Jew myself and the fact that antisemitism has increased in only a few weeks by 1353% in this country is alarming and your boss is an AH for encouraging those statistics. You need a new job with a decent boss.\n\nAlso to add on a side note... it's ironic an antisemite is ordering fish and chips when fish and chips as a meal in the UK was invented by Jewish immigrants who arrived in the UK from Spain and Portugal. So, to every antisemite in the UK... if you truly hate Jews so much, then you don't get to enjoy our delicious foods.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I could hear him through the headset without him being on speaker yelling over the top of her, not letting her speak and berating her for our \u2018terrible service technician\u2019 who had gone to site at the appointed time, waited for 20 minutes, tried to call and finally left a note that the customer was a no-show, he had to go to his next job and we would charge him for the second attendance. I couldn\u2019t get there before he had reduced her to tears because I was on another call but I took the headset from her and told him that I could not allow him to treat my staff like this and he was going to have to get someone else to do the work because we would no longer work for him.\n\nGave the receptionist an extra half hour for lunch and went to my boss (I manage the office) and they backed me up and said to put a note on the customer\u2019s file that blacklisted him.\n\nHe rang again a year later pleading for us to do the job (it\u2019s a periodical inspection job) because he apparently had pissed off all the other contractors in town and nobody wanted to work for him now.
