I was informed when I adopted him that he cannot go to a home with small children because he bit two kids. One of the children bit was 2 years old and the other was 4. He has not bitten anyone since, but I am always careful around kids still. I always ask that parents watch their small children when they bring them into his space. We don\u2019t approach children. I also will ask parents to not let small children pet him for safety. I do this because although I don\u2019t believe he will bite them, he is an animal. I don\u2019t want something to happen to anyone\u2019s child. More often than not the parents don\u2019t listen. \n\nWe have a park downtown that has fenced off areas separating a basketball court, kids playground, and a dog park with a side for small dogs and another for large dogs. Parents for some unfathomable reason think it\u2019s okay to lot only bring toddlers into the dog park, but they also bring food and toys with them. We have had several incidents like this but here is the one today. A man brought a ball, a toddler, and a five year old into the dog park to play catch. I asked him if he can take his children to the playground to toss the ball so that my dog can come inside. He insisted that it\u2019s okay and that his children love dogs. I said that it\u2019s not safe and I would prefer if he went to the other area. The man starts to argue with me and get mad because \u201cthey are good with dogs\u201d.  I said this is a dog park and it\u2019s not safe for you to put your kids with dogs they have never been around with toys and expect it to go well. So he gets further mad and continues to toss the ball. So we packed up and left to go somewhere else. This is the only dog park in this neighborhood that is off leash. There are spaces that he could go literally less than 20 feet away that are fenced and made for children to play in that was empty. \n\nAITA for asking the man to leave the dog park? I maybe TA because he can be in the park even though he had no dog with him.", "created_utc": 1691718497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15nv97p/aita_for_asking_a_man_to_leave/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He probably interpreted your initial request as you just being someone who hates kids.", "NTA I think your thinking is reasonable. Toys can make a dogs prey drive activate and they may try to get the ball. I also think it\u2019s quite reasonable that you don\u2019t want your dog to accidentally hurt someone\u2019s kids. If something was to happen he\u2019d trying to get the dog killed. I\u2019m really trying to figure out why he couldn\u2019t just go to the kids park with the kids.", "NTA. Dog parks are for dog play, hes got plenty of options without taking up space like that. You saying something and leaving is the best you can do.", "NTA - it's a DOG park.", "NTA. You need to be more clear and tell him this is a Dog Park and I am bringing my dog in to play. My dog does not like children and has already bitten two. Since this is a Dog Park, you will not be able to hold me or my dog liable for any injuries to your children. Quite honestly, I\u2019m surprised that there isn\u2019t a sign telling people not to bring children, food and toys into the Dog Park. I run into the same problem at a dog park. And I would simply point to the sign and tell them they should not be in here and if their children were injured, I wouldn\u2019t take any responsibility. I also told the kids NO, loudly and  firmly every time the children tried to touch my dog.", "NTA and if your dog had come in and the kids made him nervous, and they got bit, then he\u2019d be blaming you. It isn\u2019t always about if someone is \u201cgood with dogs\u201d or not and you are being a good dog owner by recognizing your dogs needs.

Nope nope nope NTA.", "I think dog parks need to have the equivalent of a lifeguard on duty, but, for dogs and to throw people without dogs out. Why are there people without dogs in a dog park? It makes no sense.", "NTA, but that guy sure is.", "NTA.\n\nI'd have said \"My dog has bitten children before, and you being here without a dog is putting your kids in danger.

Owners will collect solid waste and dispose of it but I would NEVER allow a child to touch the ground in a dog park.  Oh gross my brain just remembered the parasite risk as well.  I have specific boots for the dog park because I dont want to cross contaminate our yard.  Playing ball and eating in the dogs toileting space is a parenting fail.", "I explained to him that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe.

Not \"I don't think it's safe\" but \"It's NOTsafe. Your kids might be dog friendly but the dogs might not be kid friendly. You're going to feel awful if your child is bitten and you could have prevented it by merely playing in the playground rather than the dog park.\"", "The man isn't too bright. I can see what would happen if a kid picked up the wrong dog's toy.  The kids may have been around dogs, but the dogs may not have been around kids.", "Based on her description of this guy, it sounds like he views her dog\u2019s existence only as an inconvenience for himself/his kids, so I can easily see him retaliating by saying that her dog should be put down if it might bite children. He might have called animal control on her if she\u2019d said something like that."]}
