She doesn\u2019t know how to drive and this was a party where we don\u2019t know many people attending, so she asked me for a ride. I agreed. \n\nAt 1 AM or so, I was tired and wanted to go home. Alice didn\u2019t and wanted to keep partying, I pointed out I was her ride so we should get home before I\u2019m so sleepy I fall asleep at the wheel or something. She agrees but is quite upset about it. As we\u2019re in the car and Im driving, she keeps screaming at me about it. That freaks me out because it breaks my focus\u2014 I\u2019m not a super experienced driver, especially during nighttime, and so when my focus is being broken it could very well cause cause an accident. She also keeps nudging me, which again can fuck up my steering and cause an accident. I decided I didn\u2019t want to take any chances and told her I would stop the car so she could call another ride she wasn\u2019t mad at, and wait for them to arrive. She gets out of the car and keeps screaming at me, so I decide fuck this and drive away.\n\nThe next morning, I get texts from people  saying it was terrible of me to leave a woman by the side of the road because I was putting her in danger. I see it as, a) she was quite literally putting the both of us in danger inside the car and b) I know she was sober since I was with her all night, so she deliberately decided to put us at risk of a crash and then scream at me completely sober.

If she wanted a safe ride home, she had some responsibility to be a reasonable passenger. This \u201cyou left a woman by the side of the road and put her in danger\u201d reeks of misogyny, implying you\u2019re more responsible for an adult woman than she is for herself.", "NTA. She was sober doing all this? Pushing and screaming while you drove. Not okay. She was putting you both in danger and made her choices. Yes actions have consequences for sure.", "I was ready to say Y T A based on the title but after reading NTA. I wouldn\u2019t let someone yell at and nudge while I\u2019m tired and driving at night. Maybe you could have stayed with until an Uber arrived to make sure she was safe but I probably wouldn\u2019t have dealt with her at that point either.", "NTA - if she wants to be that way she can call a damn Uber", "NTA if it was me, I would\u2019ve left her to lol", "NTA  She could have caused an accident.", "Screaming and nudging you? Really? This reads pretty made up to me.", "NTA, she was being super bratty, as you said her behaviour while you tried to drive endangered you", "NTA but how would you feel if someone left one of your family members on the side of a road at night. I would be very angry. You probably could have handled that better.", "NTA - but it\u2019s a close call. My .02 find better friends", "ESH. She was being inappropriate but you should have waited for the Uber to get there.", "ESH. She is an ass for not allowing you to focus on driving, but that does not excuse your actions, OP. You should have moved her to the back seat, dropped her off and cut off your friendship.", "ESH", "ESH.\n\nYour friend was being bratty, she was acting ungrateful and endangering the both of you -- I don't think you're an asshole for leaving her.\n\nHowever, you need to know that by doing this you also put her in a very vulnerable position. She was a young woman all alone on the side of a road at 1 am AND she was drunk. It's a miracle she reached home safely. \n\nWhat I think you should've done instead was drop her off at a nearby gas station, or someplace where she wouldn't have been that exposed -- because at the end of the day, she was an AH and was putting both of you in danger. \n\nWhile you're not explicitly an AH and your friend most definitely is, I think you could've handled it a bit better.   \nYou're 18, you're young, and you still have a lot to learn about the world...let this be a lesson in maturity and being the bigger person if not anything.", "YTA. It's not a good idea to leave her beside the road. You said you both didn't know a lot of people at the party. Who's she gonna call? The best scenario might have been to tell her to get in the back, and you'll take her home or back to the party.", "ESH", "NTA. Put out or get out", "Your both assholes.", "Both assholes. She's a brat for sure. She needs to learn to drive her self.", "I think ESH, though Alice is the worst.\n\nObviously Alice was disruptive and dangerous so I agree with stopping the car and booting her out. Driving off before the alternate ride arrived because she was shouting sounds AH-ish. \n\nDid you plan with Alice what time you'd need to leave the party?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can be extremely responsible as a woman and still be more susceptible to danger in certain situations. It\u2019s more about just not being alone rather than some \u201cneed man to protect\u201d nonsense. I\u2019d say OP should have waited even if he was a woman too.", "I was initially going to wait but at that point I just didn\u2019t have the patience or the energy to deal with it", "Yeah, the whole thing freaked me out", "If they were putting both themselves and the person driving at risk, I\u2019d consider kicking them out of the car the safer option for both of them", "definitely true", "She refused to call one and just kept screaming at me instead, and I was already feeling tired and wanted to get home before I fell asleep at the wheel", "I don\u2019t know.

Back or not, she could still scream and nudge me", "[removed]", "Yep. Totally different if passenger were intoxicated, regardless of gender.", "It\u2019s misogyny because OP stopped the car and the passenger made the choice to get out rather than stop being an asshole. Passenger put herself in danger. Sure, OP could have waited and continued to take the abuse, but passenger is an adult who is capable of being responsible for her own decisions. OP didn\u2019t \u201cput her in danger\u201d because OP isn\u2019t responsible for keeping a sober adult safe when that sober adult isn\u2019t participating in that plan.", "I get that.", "So how did she get home?", "Put them in the back or wait for a different ride to show. That way you know they are safe. What if she got raped that night or worse.Would you still feel the same way?", "I must've overlooked that, thanks for pointing it out. \n\nI agree. You shouldn't have to put yourself in danger in order to be the bigger person, but there are other things that you could have done. \n\nMaybe kick her out of the car but not drive away until someone is there to pick her up. Lock the car doors so she can't enter but also make sure she doesn't get kidnapped.\n\nIt is hard to think straight or come up with viable solutions in the heat of the moment or while you're on edge and panicking.

I would be more forgiving if that was the case", "But your argument removes the fact that she\u2019s a woman and is more susceptible to danger alone. Sure, she\u2019s being an idiot but he\u2019s leaving her alone on the side of the road and anything could happen once he leaves (because it\u2019s safer for women in travel in pairs or be in company with someone out at night). It\u2019s not misogyny to point that out. I also disagree, he has a bit of ethical responsibility not to leave someone on the side of the road when the odds are higher that something will happen to them if he leaves.", "The misogyny part is the implication she can\u2019t make her own choices. Maybe she assumed OP would stay with her after she left his car and continued abusing him? I guess if that were the case, maybe it\u2019s not misogyny. But seems like she was acting like she didn\u2019t want OP around.", "walked probably", "Well, even if she was in the back, she could still scream at me and nudge me to the point she distracted me and caused us to crash. \n\nAs for her being raped or something, of course that would be terrible, but as far as getting kicked out, that was her own doing", "That\u2019s a fair suggestion, if something like this ever happens again (not with Alice since I\u2019m not letting her in my car again, more speaking generally) I will do so. Thank you", "I think it\u2019s fair to assume that any person of any gender might not be in the right capacity to make choices in their best interest if they\u2019re raving mad at the time, which is why I don\u2019t think it\u2019s misogyny specifically. But I can see what you mean!", "So put her in the back and WAIT for her ride to show. Or call her an Uber.

Why post if you\u2019re just going to argue with everyone who comments?", "i\u2019m correcting a misconception. \n\nas for being in danger, she\u2019d be in more danger in the car than out of it because if she kept screaming and touching me we would have crashed", "You\u2019re agreeing with everyone who says NTA and arguing with those who are saying YTA. \n\nAlso, I said WAIT in the car, as in pull over and wait for her ride to show up or an Uber. That way everyone is safe.", "You could stop the car, call someone, wait for them to show up. Don\u2019t leave people on the street in the middle of the night. It\u2019s dangerous.", "regardless, in your case you made a misconception and corrected it. \n\nand I didn\u2019t feel safe having her in my car, or within vicinity of it because she was screaming at me. so in that case not everybody is safe, no.", "I didn\u2019t feel safe being in her presence at this point"]}
