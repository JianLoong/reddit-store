Tbh, I think guys with long hair look way better.\n\nI love to play with my guy friends hair (I'm not attracted to him and he's ok with me playing with it) but is a strawberry blonde color and midway down his back and he loves the attention(theater kid lol). Idk, my whole friend group is obsessed with it, and like I said, he's a theater kid, so he doesn't mind the attention.", ">There are literally millions of men out there with short hair.

He changes his age by a year so his girlfriend doesn't get suspicious that this extremely specific scenario isn't about him and her? Like is she gonna find this post and say \"Oh my boyfriend has waist length hair and a moustache and refuses to cut it despite me constantly pushing him to. He also told me I'm free to leave and he'll have his hair long after I'm gone. Is this about me? WAIT the ages don't match up. This can't be about us!\"", "Wait he wanted her to cut it?", "No, he expressed no opinion about it according to the post, but she was convinced it would break his heart. She wanted to cut it. It was super weird.", "NTA. Imagine that you'd said that women should only wear dresses and insisted that's all she did - it would make you a huge AH, and rightly so. The answer's still the same when you flip the script. That wouldn't be the last thing she tried to change about you, by a long shot.", "Boooooooo. Maybe just a trim or an undercut or something? Especially since you mentioned you wear your hair up. \n\nNAH", "NTA. Something tells me you would\u2019ve woken up sans hair one day if you hadn\u2019t.", "NTA. Its your hair, man.", "NTA\nYour body/hair is part of who you are, and if she doesn't like it she's welcome to get with a guy with shorter hair.", "NTA\n\nShe asked, you answered \u2014 and then she kept pushing and pushing.\n\nYou are correct \u2014 she has the option to choose someone else to date, if she hates long hair that much.", "But seriously, who are all these people that just have rando people texting the other party in their squabbles?!?! Why is this a thing? Can we make this not a thing? \n\nNTA op. Keep your hair, your hair care products, your porn stach, and sashay away.", "NTA but can you recommend some good healthy long hair products? Help a long haired friend out?", "NTA. If a man was this determined to cut a woman\u2019s hair, or be adamant she shouldn\u2019t cut it for him, he would be a sexist asshole.\n\nWhich is why, your girlfriend, is a sexist asshole.\n\nI think it\u2019s okay, to express as a partner your preferences when a partner asks. I think it\u2019s even okay, to express your preferences and request them occasionally if it\u2019s reasonable.\n\nBut you should not make your partner feel bad or unattractive due to your preferences. And they should not be BIG changes that take months to grow back. And your partner should always feel comfortable saying no and the other person should love and like them enough to accept those choices.\n\nI guess my example is, my husband has fairly average shorter guy hair. He knows *I like it* extra short and sometimes he gets it cut extra short. But it\u2019s not an expectation and it certainly doesn\u2019t affect my overall attraction to him. When he does cut it short, it grows back fast. So it\u2019s sort of a fruitful back and forth for both of us. Plus he likes that when he cuts it a little extra short he doesn\u2019t have to pay to get it cut as soon. Downside is sometimes they really screw up  the short cut and he dislikes the shaved edges when they go ham on the cut if you know what I mean.\n\nThe outlier I suppose is sometimes he tries to grow a shortish beard. I don\u2019t really like it because, partially I\u2019m not a fan of how it looks, but overall I really don\u2019t notice it one way or another and I love and am attracted to him both ways. What does bother me is his beard hair is SO scratchy and it actually makes me breaks out and it hurts my face when he kisses me. So sometimes he\u2019ll grow it out for a short period but I admittedly kiss him less and he doesn\u2019t like that. So he doesn\u2019t do that often. I don\u2019t try to pressure him out of it, it just really does irritate my sensitive skin, and it hurts my nose if the weather is cold and my nose is chapped.\n\nAnyways, partners should find their partners attractive enough to not make weird big asks like huge feature changes I think. Like if my husband decided to die his hair blonde. If I\u2019m being honest, I don\u2019t think it would look good on him. But I\u2019d be perfectly happy for him to give it a go. I love him and he is always handsome in my eyes. It\u2019s not my choice and it\u2019s not my business.", "Dump her faster than you can read this Reddit post!\n\nShe's extremely manipulative and controlling----Christ, how could you have put up with this behavior for this long?!\n\nNo more warnings, just leave now.\n\nOh yeah, obviously NTA, but your girlfriend had better be toast, otherwise you might wake-up one day with a cleanly shaved head.  \ud83e\udd23", "Nta", "NTA.

If she's THIS obsessed about it (despite meeting you when it was already long), I wouldn't put it past her to cut it in the night.", "NTA. In fact, she\u2019s a RED FLAG. If I were you I\u2019d head out. She sounds incredibly controlling, telling you how you should have your hair and guilt tripping you because you won\u2019t drastically alter your appearance for her. As a woman I personally love long hair on men, they look great with it and it\u2019s gorgeous. No idea what she\u2019s talking about\u2026 I think she\u2019s just trying to control you.

She doesn't find your hair attractive (per her own words and her trying to get you to get rid of it) and you have no issues with her leaving you because of it.\n\nSo why not just break up with her?

My hair is a bit shorter now as I just donated 10 inches about a month ago but fit a few years I had my hair a little past my waist. It was a love hate relationship.

She doesn't respect you, and that's not going to change anytime soon. If she did respect you, she would have stopped asking you to cut your hair after the very first time you said no.", "NTA. I\u2019m not a fan of men with long hair but that\u2019s my preference. There are people out there who love men with long hair and there are people who don\u2019t give a shit about the length of their partners hair. Everyone is entitled to their own preferences.

Forcing you to cut your hair (which you\u2019re clearly attached to) is messed up and toxic", "That's basically how control in a relationship builds - very gradually. She tells him to do something he doesn't want to do, he says 'no', she guilts him into doing it. She makes enough noise about this and makes him out to be the bad guy because \"it's just this little thing\" to the point where he gives up (or tries to \"make it up to her\"). Next time it's going to be something else where she doesn't take no for an answer, and again it's \"just this little thing\".

You've gotten a lot of good responses here. To sum it up:\n\n1.) It's your hair, and your bodily autonomy. She has no right to dictate it.\n\n2.) It's highly manipulative to tell someone \"If you love me, you'll...\". That is a huge, glaring red flag right there.\n\n3.) It's not about the hair. It's about control. She's trying to see how much control she has over you, and how far you will go to make her happy. It won't stop with the hair.

Be watchful, she may try to cut your hair off when you're sleeping or something. She sounds that unhinged.\n\n5.) All of this should be a deal breaker for you.

As a woman who has had long hair all my life, and have always had people demanding I cut it off, I understand just how hurtful and damaging that is.

It's like an attack on who you *ARE*. It's hard to ignore, but that is exactly what you need to do. You need to disregard those asshats and do what is right for you and you alone.\n\nAnd finally, I like guys with long hair. It looks awesome, and it is totally my thing.
