Already sounds like you might spend more money on it than you do her anyway \ud83e\udd23", "This right here!!! I think NTA but saying you'd choose your hairstyle over your significant other feels.... Harsh. But ultimately it does seem like if this is something she just can't let go you're not compatible.", "Exactly. She can\u2019t accept him the way he is.", "I\u2019d consider it a healthy obsession, yea I spend a good amount of money and time on my hair, but it\u2019s not to the point of being detrimental, I just really love my hair. I never really felt like myself with shorter hairstyles and I also never really got compliments or noticed, but once I grew it out I started standing out, I mean a ginger with hair damn near 4 feet long and a porn stache draws some eyes, and I like the attention and compliments so I take really good care of it", "Probably the toxic 'i can change him' mentality some ladies have...", "He's weird for setting a boundary that he doesn't want to cut his hair short?\n\nYour definition of \"super weird\" is super weird.", "Look, I tell my girlfriends almost everything. I\u2019m 100% the type of person that needs to vent about situations, because talking them out helps me realize I\u2019m either right or wrong. I make it clear to any partner that I\u2019m a big mouth, unless it\u2019s genuinely not my story to tell, (like their family issues, I only vent about MY arguments and shit that directly involved ME) my friends are gonna hear about it. If they don\u2019t like that: we aren\u2019t compatible, and that\u2019s completely okay. HOWEVER. I have never asked a friend to get involved in my situations. I\u2019m literally just blowing off steam or getting advice, because I\u2019m also ND and I don\u2019t always see everything correctly \n\nIf my friends contacted my SO and said literally anything, even if I\u2019m 100% in the right, I\u2019d be livid. I have never asked someone to chew out my boyfriend for me, or fix my relationship like that. That\u2019s the most childish thing I\u2019ve ever heard", "This!! If my SO's friends ever messaged or contacted me about our relationship I would just start cussing. Why would I have to justify myself to anyone I'm not in a relationship with? Like really? I'm not about to relive high school.", "He's not choosing his hair over her. He's choosing his own body autonomy over her.", "Not for the boundary. Dude can do what he likes with his body, and nobody gets to tell him otherwise. More for how much it appears to define him, by the way he talks about it in this post and to his girlfriend.", "Alright. That makes sense. In terms of this specific situation you're NTA. Body autonomy is important and no one else really gets a say in your hairstyle.\n\nI still think there's more going on here based on your post history. You need to do some reflection on what you want from your relationships and have a real  and respectful conversation with your girlfriend.", "He did try a kinder way. He said, \u201cLook, it\u2019s not gonna happen, let\u2019s drop it.\u201d\n\nHe unambiguously laid out his boundary. She continued to push it. She is no longer owed any consideration.", "Lol, I'm just saying when you show people the door, they tend to take it. But hell, even if he went about it the nicer way, it would be up to her to fix her shit, good luck to him!", "Many women (me included) love men with long hair. Find one of those and be happy.", "NTA. My husband grew his hair during covid and now its about the same length as mine. Did it look a bit dodgy while it was growing out? Yes, but currently it looks pretty good and I'd rather have a husband who's happy with how he looks.", "NTA but I think your obsession with your own hair is kinda weird.", "NTA you have had long hair the whole time you were dating, so why is she insisting that you cut it? There are men and women who seem to seek out someone and then destroy whatever it is that gives them joy. I was a hairdresser for over ten years until I became allergic to products, so I have seen the results of female friends getting together to commit hair assault. Usually it is on a woman accused of homewrecking, boyfriend stealing, or whatever, but I have seen the aftermath in the salon. Just because you are a man doesn't make you immune, because she is obsessed with cutting your hair off and has already enlisted friends to her side. Don't cut your hair to make it up to her, that is just giving into her unreasonable demands.", "NTA. I love guys with long hair, and it\u2019s up to you what you do with it", "NTA\n\nI like clean-shaven men. I married a man who keeps a beard most of the time. I love him to absolute pieces, beard and all. (It\u2019s actually weird to me to see him clean-shaven the occasional times he does it!)\n\nHe\u2019s told me that I get an opinion on his hair, but it\u2019s his body. I don\u2019t care, and it\u2019s something so inconsequential.\n\nI can understand her feeling hurt over this, but she\u2019s chosen her hill to die on.", "She doesn't love u. She's trying to change u. Y should u love someone who sees u as a project? NTA", "if you loved me you would xyz is never healthy\n\ntime to really exit the relationship\n\nNTA", "NTA - you are not choosing your hair over her.   You are choosing you over her.\n\nTell the flying monkeys this:\n\n You are not choosing your hair over her.  \n\nYou are dumping her for her lack of respect over your bodily autonomy and her attempts to control you and her refusal to accept no as an answer.  \n\nYou are choosing to not be nagged and harassed.   \n\nYou are choosing to dump someone who does not like you as you are and go find someone who will.", "NTA ewww.... \n\nI honestly don't know how you lasted 4 years?  I wouldn't have put up with that more than like twice.", "NTA\n\n\"No, she chose hair over me.\"", "NTA long hair on guys is hot. break up with her and find somebody who appreciates your style.", "NTA. Once someone brings others into an argument they\u2019ve proven they have the emotional intelligence of an 8 year old.", "NTA, I don't have super long hair but I do regularly dye my hair different colors (blue, green, purple, etc). I wouldn't stick to a natural color if my partner demanded it. My personal confidence and self expression is way more important than any relationship", "When I dated a guy, he asked me how I preferred his hair. I said how his hair looked was up to him, because it was his face, and he should cut it the way that made him happy with the way he looked. \n\nNTA", "NTA and if I may, you need a better girlfriend. Ask her to get a boob job to make it up to you. See how that pans out", "NTA", "NTA. She's well within her rights to dislike your hair. She's definitely crossing a line constantly asking you to cut it when you've already said no.   \n\n\nYou've given her plenty of opportunities to drop the subject.", "Nah bro, leave your hair as it is my long hair brother, let that woman make her choice \ud83d\udc4d", "Dude, it's a power-play. Don't even think of doing it.", "I prefer short hair and no facial hair and chose to date and marry someone who looked that way. She should do the same. You are NTA but she is to want to change you. Huge red flags.", "NTA. If she loved you she wouldn\u2019t demand you change to suit her aesthetic", "nta - she was attacted to u and started a relationship when u had already this long hair etc and now suddenly she wants to change you?", "Lol if you had the hair before you two even met and she thinks \"men look better with short hair,\" WHY IN THE FUCK DID SHE GET WITH A GUY WITH LONG HAIR?! The mind truly boggles at the stupidity on display here. NTA.", "NTA. Why would you have to cut your hair to make it up to her, She is the one who keeps pushing the issue after you have made yourself perfectly clear on the matter.", "I got this impression too. It's not even about the hair, she's probably just 'testing' him to see how willing he is to change for her/do what she wants.\n\n Especially since he had long hair when the met, she should have just not dated him if that was actually a deal breaker.", "His hair is her competition.", "The only AH move on his part is the combination of man bun plus porn stache.", "How is it weird to take care and pride in your hair?", "Is her name Delilah?", "100% this!!! My mom, my friends... they all know sometimes you just need to ven or talk it out. Advice on what I say is given to me. I would not tolerate a friend that felt like they needed to be my flying monkey.", "I was gonna say Samson she will cut your hair!", "Exactly...as another person with waist-length hair, if my husband demanded I cut it all off I would laugh in his face. Your hair is part of your body."]}
