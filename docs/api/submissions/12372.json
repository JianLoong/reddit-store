If she really loved you, it wouldn't be an issue.  \n2. She shouldn't have gotten involved/stayed involved with you with the thought that she could change you.  That is not reasonable.  Growing and changing together over time is inevitable, but asking someone to just change because you don't like something about them--find someone else that does match what you want.", "NTA.\n\nAnd uh, if I were you, I would be worried about her coming after you with scissors in the middle of the night while you're sleeping.", "NTA.

I'm just not changing myself for you or anyone else. If I don't meet your standards of beauty, then feel free to go out there and find someone who does. \n\nThis reminds me of when I was in my early 20's.

I'd say you don't have a future with her.\n\n(And you can be sure there are plenty of women out there who like dudes with long hair.  The last time I got any kind of haircut, the year started with a \"1\", and my wife of 27 years still loves it.  The last person who tried to get me to cut it was my dad, but even he eventually gave up when he kept seeing me get compliments when we would run errands together.)", "NTA, obviously\n\nBut you asked the wrong question.\n\nYou asked:\n\n>Am I the asshole for choosing my hair over my partner?\n\nBut that's not what you did.\n\nThe more appropriate (to the situation) question would be:\n\n>Am I the asshole for choosing to give my partner the choice of leaving if she can't accept my boundaries?\n\nYou chose not to cut your hair.

You tried being firm. And it's not like you went raging and insulting her. In this case, stating the facts is entirely appropriate.\n\nAs for her friends... your hair is even *less* their business than it is hers. \n\nAlso... I would immediately dump her, and definitely stop sleeping anywhere in the same vicinity.

But you choose to escalate the situation by issuing such a harshly worded ultimatum, it was the asshole way to do it. The more reasonable step of being  honest and vulnerable, something like \"it's hurtful that you won't stop asking me to cut my hair, are you able to let this go or not?\" would of been the better way to go.
