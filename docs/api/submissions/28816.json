I call her my bonus mom. But I figure stepmom is the more wider known term and wanted to use it here to make things easier.\n\nSo I (22F) am the middle child of my full siblings. My older brother is 25 and my younger brother is 21. We lost our mom at 2, 3 and 6 and our stepmom came into our lives 3 years later. My younger brother and I call her \"Mama Jane\" and we love her. My older brother calls her Jane and doesn't really have a great relationship with her. He said no to being adopted when it was brought up 6 months after our parents got married. My younger brother and I said okay after being talked to about the adoption. Though I never felt like I wanted it.\n\nSo my younger brother and I were adopted and I even read the little speech thing my dad wrote for me to say during the adoption, that told my stepmom it was my dream to be adopted by her, etc, which were dad's words and not mine. My older brother was not, though the offer was extended multiple times when he was still a kid. I honestly lost count of how often it came up and how many times we were asked.\n\nIn my teens I started to struggle with the adoption. It made me sad. I struggled to put it into words and still do to a point. I never brought it up because I was worried my dad would be mad or my stepmom would be hurt. At 18 I started seeing a therapist. Therapy helped. We talked about a lot from my feelings on the adoption, to reasons I felt that way and also about my mom and how dad no longer talked about her after he met my stepmom and how he removed all mom's photos after he started dating my stepmom. It was suggested some of my feelings could be connected to that and how it was like mom vanished, and was only brought up when dad told my older brother she would be ashamed of him rejecting our stepmom.\n\nI never planned on expressing my regret to my parents. But then last weekend my grandparents were visiting and we were all together. My parents were using my younger brother and I to say my older brother made a mistake and look how happy and glad we are to be adopted. My younger brother said it wasn't that big of a deal and he didn't care about the adoption one way or the other. But it didn't make him happier. My stepmom looked really shocked by that. Then dad tried to say I was happier and so I admitted to wishing she hadn't. I said I still loved my stepmom. But I wish she hadn't felt like she needed to adopt me. My stepmom was heartbroken to realize neither of us were glad she adopted us. My dad was pissed and he started to yell at my younger brother and I but my older brother told him it was his fault for not checking we actually wanted the adoption.\n\nMy dad was still mad I said that to him and my stepmom and my stepmom hasn't answered any of my calls or texts since.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697189080, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176upp5/aita_for_telling_my_parents_i_wish_my_stepmom/", "score": 371, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I never said anything before because I knew it would hurt my stepmom and anger my dad. I knew there would be consequences to voicing it.

Your father is. \n\nYour older brother probably feels like your dad is trying to erase his mom. I would certainly feel that way. From where I sit, your dad has tried to force his entire family into just being the original family he had all along without considering that you all might have feelings about your first mom and that not want to feel disconnected from her. You, and your bonus mom, are caught up in all this. \n\nThat speech he made you make is really infuriating to me for some reason. \n\nI would give it some time to cool off before offering to talk to bonus mom, alone, about how complicated your feelings are on this.", "NTA. I\u2019m beginning to think that step parent adoptions should be banned before the age of 15 or so, because the child really can\u2019t understand what\u2019s involved under they\u2019re older.", "NTA i think its hilarious how you father wanted to humiliate your brother and make him regret his decision in front of your grandparents but it went the other way", "NTA. They erased your mother.", "Why don't they care at all about your feelings? I don't understand all the parents on here forcing step relationships and living in some self-created fantasy of a new family. As if your mom stops being your mom when she dies. She doesn't. Good parents care about what their kids truly feel and about their kids being happy. These two don't even seem to have been interested to ask. Your dad's anger at you and forcing you to read that speech at the adoption is disgusting. NTA.", "Nta. I hate how manipulative your dad and stepmom are. Is there a way to still reverse the adoption? Or get your maternal relatives to adopt you instead so you can cut ties with your manipulative stepmom and dad?", "NTA. You weren't being mean when you said it. You're also really young when \"you made\" the decision. It's not like you confronted them about it and blamed them disrespectfully.\n\nThat being said, I think, you should give your stepmom some space. The first person you have to talk to is your dad. Because he's the one who brought stepmom into your lives and kinda forced the situation.\n\nI don't know if it will help or if you're comfortable of telling him about your therapy. To him, it may be coming out of nowhere. As a father, he also needs to understand what he did and how it affected you. From his perspective, maybe he's trying to give you and your siblings a mother's love by introducing your stepmom or being considerate of how stepmom will feel if there are pictures of your mom everywhere. I think, he tried to be considerate but also failed to do so at the end.\n\nI hope your father will try to understand you. Ultimately, it's the case of adults overlooking the feelings of their children. I think, he should be the one to talk to your stepmom so they can think about how they should've handled the situation better. And how they have to deal with it now.", "NTA- You should be able to express your feelings and your dad shouldn't have strong armes you and your little brother in being adopted by your stepmom, he's definitely and AH. The jury is still out with your stepmom though.

I wonder how many lies your dad been feeding your stepmother", "NTA (your dad is) but your poor, poor stepmom. She must feel like every bit of love she thought she had from you guys was a total lie. \n\nOut of all of you, she\u2019s the one I feel the worst for.", "NAH at least not to you. You were 6 you likely didn\u2019t take much convincing to be adopted . It\u2019s also so boring in general. Who cares like if you don\u2019t want to be adopted all you really have to do is rip up that paper and to yourself and whoever matters you weren\u2019t adopted. Who cares what some document says it changes literally 0 about your life. If you want to learn more about your mom go visit her siblings or friends and gather photos of her and talk to your dad one on one about her. That\u2019s what\u2019s important. People just do what they think it best and it doesn\u2019t always work out, oh well that\u2019s life.", "Not really sure if this is a thing of moral judgement? The whole stuff is complicated, and i guess especially your father is to blame. However, I can also understand if his only way to move foward was to seemingly \"erase\" her, even if it is heartbreaking. The adoption itself has benefits, and it is logical i guess? And your stepmom does not seem to be evil, right? \nAnyway, I dont think your feelings are wring, but i guess you should reach out to your stepmother and have a calm serious talk to reassure that you do not resent her or anything. She seems entirely blameless from what you tell us. \n\nI guess at some pount, someone took unwillingly one or two wring turns while arriving at the destination refardless? \n\nGoing with NAH. But you should mend things woth your stepmom, i would guess she is heartbroken and this might kill the relationship when it festers.", "NAH. \nYour dad was a widowed father of 3 kids trying to do his best. He wants to believe it was the best decision in light of a horrible situation. \nYour stepmother sounds like a great bonus mom. \nYou and your bros have the right to feel complicated about the whole thing. \n\nLife isn\u2019t perfect and it sounds like everyone did their best, just cause they felt short of expectations doesn\u2019t make them an asshole.", "thats what you get for strong arming children \"pre consciousness\" into such decisions. NTA", "NTA\nYour Dad tried to replace your Mom with Jane.\nHe got rid of her pictures and wanted to act like she never existed because he wanted to seem like a \"normal, loving family\" with your Bonus-Mom.\n\nHe is angry because you destroyed his fantasies.\nSadly, he doesn't seem to care about your or your brothers feelings and wants you to play along.\n\nHe will likely try to pressure you more to \"accept her as your real mom because she raised you\". Even if you love her, he won't be happy you still think about your mom.\n\nDoes he treat your older brother worse because of it? How often do you see family of your mothers side?", "He already sees my older brother rarely. Their relationship has been strained for so long.

None of it was my own words and it was almost entirely none of my actual feelings. But I knew dad would be angry if I said I didn't want to read it.", "I think even at that age there could be pressure to say yes. Honestly, I think a therapist should be assigned to talk to the kids and help make the decision. At the very least they could make sure the kids are actually on board and it wouldn't be more harmful to go ahead.", "It needs to be a conscious decision made by the child for it to happen, not something brought up by parents/step-parents.", "There are some very valid reasons especially when one parent is dead. There is a girl I grew up with who's dad died when she was a baby and mom died from cancer when she was in middle school. She always said that she was thankful that her stepdad adopted her before her mom got sick because it saved her from foster care and her crazy abusive aunts and uncles. But they always treated it as nothing more than a legal document that allowed her stepdad to keep looking after her. It didn't change who he was in her life. That's the real problem here. Dad erased mom and put words into OPs mouth. The kids are also now adults why is he still even bringing the adoption up anymore.", ">I can also understand if his only way to move foward was to seemingly \"erase\" her,\n\n\nOnly way forward is to erase the mother of your children? \n\nOnly way forward?? \n\n\n>She seems entirely blameless from what you tell us.\n\nEntirely blameless? So adopting the kids were thrust upon her same way it was to the children? \n\n\n>i would guess she is heartbroken and this might kill the relationship when it festers.\n\n\nOp better hurry to erase her hurt like they erased her mother and very nearly erased her elder brother's feelings on the matter.", "Ignoring the feelings of your 3 kids in order to appease your new wife is hardly doing his best.", "I have a feeling your older brother had a sense of...satisfaction when the truth came out.", "I\u2019m sorry. He shouldn\u2019t have done that. Children aren\u2019t props in someone else\u2019s story.", "That speech IS the problem. You should have never had to make a choice between making your father angry and saying something that you don\u2019t mean.", "Also, it doesn't help that they erased your mother from the house and forced you into doing and saying things you didn't want. Not cool of them. They dug the grave, now they have to live in it. \n\nNTA", "Its horrible when we feel pressured to compromise our feelings due to fear of a parent lashing out. It trains us to dismiss our feelings adulthood.", "I feel bad for all of you kids.\n\nI also feel a bit sad for your stepmum.\n\nYour dad manipulated everyone into trying to get his own way but actually all that he's done is upset you all.", "As he should. The oldest watched all this go down when he was too young to resist for his siblings and now vindication finally came almost two decades later. Can't inagine how he feels to have confirmation dad and stepmom were even more in the wrong than he thought."]}
