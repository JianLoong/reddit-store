The delusion.\nYou could expect it from a 15 year old, but her father? Really? When she mentioned her hurt feelings, it would have been a good time for him to teach her about empathy for others going through difficult situations, not jump on the bandwagon and uphold her understandable immaturity.\n\nI am shocked. A loved one spending a month in hospital is a very long time. A very scary time. As your family, you would expect support, not recriminations. And if they have an issue about the grandparents, they should bring that up with the grandparents, not with you. I am disgusted.", "NTA what an awful family.", "Yeah no. NTA.

NTA, obviously. Sounds like your niece takes after her dad.  For your BIL to be upset and say it's your fault the grandpa missed her birthday is so outrageously out of line.  You weren't forcing your dad to be anywhere, and you certainly aren't responsible for him remembering/not remembering a birthday.", "NTA.

It could have been an opportunity to acknowledge the hurt feelings, but also give a chance for niece to learn that sometimes in life, focus must shift to accommodate extenuating circumstances. A gentle conversation about that, could be instrumental in helping her gain some compassion. \n\nMaybe pull aside sis and BIL for a similar conversation. \n\nTo be clear, I think NTA. But left to the sole guidance of her father (& I can't tell if your sister behaves similarly), niece might turn out just like him.

It sounds like you were being too proud to apologize, and that never really helps anything. \n\nOn the other hand, her father was being a huge AH. He had zero sensitivity for your situation with your son. A sick or injured child is a miserable thing, and he's not considering how hard it is for a few days, let alone a month.

Given her father\u2019s participation in the exchange, it\u2019s no mystery whence that philosophy came. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable for her to have been disappointed and even upset by your absence, but her demand (obviously emboldened by her father) that you apologize to her for it is an act of extreme entitlement, and it displays frightening lacks of awareness and empathy.

And yes, a 15 yo can and do understand extenuating circumstances, but extenuating circumstances isn't a rug to sweep everything under either. Also all teenagers are rather psychopathic in nature, thinking only of their own survival.  \n\nNow your BIL does seem to have egged it on with his comment specifically \"taking everyone's attention for a month\" and \"making her grandfather miss her BDay\". Those are selfish and untrue statements and is very saddening that a full grown man of at least 30 years would make such comments especially with his teenage daughter present. Now we could say maybe he was just playing the over protective dad card and really wanted to show his daughter he was on her side but to say inherently untrue statements isn't an effective way to do that. Because no one can \"take\" our attention, we give it for the better or worse, also no one can make anyone do anything. Granddad missing the party was his choice and while it had to do with the circumstances you were in, it was his choice to make, and he made it on his own. \n\nNow on to why I think you're YTA here. Imaging being in her shoes. I don't need to image very hard as I've been in close proximity to it many times.

Validating someone's feelings is important at every age, but especially to those who have not reached the age of majority. \n\nNot wishing her a happy birthday was a mistake, an unintentional mistake but a mistake none the less. And it hurts no one, by your own admittance you agree, to apologize to say \"I'm sorry\" and no \" I'm sorry, but...\" \"I'm sorry, but\"s are not apologizes they are excuses. No human is infallible, we all stumble and fall and error, and this error hurt her feelings. I thinks she says it the most eloquently;\n\n>so you would rather us leave than acknowledge you hurt my feelings?\n\nThink about that. Think about what she is really saying. She understands you didn't forget her birthday with malicious intent or with a depraved heart, your mind was simply preoccupied by a rather unfortunate situation. However, now that the situation has calmed down some, it isn't going to cost you anything to say, \"hey I errored, and I'm sorry my error resulted in your feelings being hurt.\" In fact, admitting you made a mistake might just give you something, a closer relationship with your niece, or merely the returning of a lost piece of humanity.", "NTA, what is she, like five?

Instead you got pissy that your niece said you hurt her and that she was upset and tried to have open and honest conversation with her uncle. YTA for that. Your BiL is an AH for inistigating it to go further but they are clearly hurt that her and her birthday were forgotten by everyone for you and your son and that in an entire month she couldn\u2019t be remembered on one day, her birthday.

She sounds indulged and I don't think she's realised yet that she isn't automatically everyone's top priority on her birthday. Maybe because this was the first time something like this happened. \n\nUnfortunately, her main takeaway from the row is probably that her uncle was unsympathetic and dismissive when she voiced something that was important to her, rather than \"Oh, I understand now how seriously ill my cousin was, that hurting my feelings wasn't deliberate, and why my grandad needed to be at the hospital rather than my party on my birthday\". \n\nDon't beat yourself up for not responding in a saint-like fashion though.

He can express his feelings and experience a little too, in an age appropriate way. she doesn\u2019t sound like some massive brat, the BIL does, but the niece not so much.", "This is the answer OP. It's not her fault that she doesn't understand what you've been going through. I would never wish that on anyone! And it's a sign of trust that she opened up to share her feelings. You dismissed them, though and I think it's worth having a heart to heart about it later. She needs to be empathetic to you and the whole situation, but let's face it. You do too, when you have the bandwidth. She likely also spent a month worrying about her cousin, without really knowing what to do with all those emotions, and her mom's attention was likely pretty split between trying to care for her family and help with yours. No one is at their best in that scenario and this sounds like a pretty sad birthday for her, and coming on the backs of multiple years of COVID birthdays? We need every celebration we can get. Life is precious. \n\nMy best friend lost his 5 year battle with leukemia the day before my mom's birthday. Safe to say that none of us were in a celebratory mood that year, or even the next few. While my mom would never complain about it, or center herself, I can still recognize that it must have been hard for her, and when I was able, I tried to spend intentional time with her to celebrate belatedly. Idk. I think there's room for you to do that too, when you can.", ">Again she's a teenager\n\nexactly. She should be old enough for the nostalgia of a birthday party to wear off. it's *normal* to not have everyone show up to a b-day party. growing up it, was always my parents, brother and a cake. maybe a card from the grandparents.", "so you want him to acknowledge that he hurt her feelings by making her grandpa miss her birthday? that isn't something that should be validated, because its bullshit. BIL was guilt tripping OP for his son being in the hospital. nobody in this scenario validated OPs feelings of....being upset because his kid was just in the hospital for a month. what world are you in that the person being piled onto in a situation like this is the AH?", "Amen! Validating others emotions is a habit of highly successful people, so obviously by doing so gives something back.", "You\u2019re very welcome, of course! I wouldn\u2019t insult someone like that who is a genuinely kind person. My apologies for the confusing wording and thanks for giving me a chance to correct how it sounded. I didn\u2019t realize how it came across as if I was including everyone when that wasn\u2019t how I intended it to be.\n\nI hope you have a great night, and know that you\u2019re not in the wrong here either and have nothing to apologize for! \n\n\ud83d\udc9a", "It's not that they didn't show up. It's that no one from a full side of her family even texted her. That'll hurt most 15 year olds feelings, as someone who works with 15 year olds lol. That's why apologizing first and explaining simply what happened after helps. Her feelings are validated and she actually understands what happened. Here all she took away from this was that she is not important to that side of her family. That's it.", "Not that he hurt her feelings. That her feelings are hurt. It's not about blame", "No, they're not. But what does OP lose by validating her that 'yes, it sucks to feel ignored on your birthday \"", "what do you want the OP to say?\n\"I'm sorry that my son was in the hospital for a month and didn't have the time, the energy or the mental faculty to stroke your ego, and i still don't.\"\n\nif the teenager had the presence of mind to understand any reasonable apology... they'd ever have asked, and the OP can't be held responsible for how somebody *feels*.\n\n\nyeah, i can understand how it might hurt their feelings, doesn't mean the OP did anything wrong. reality being harsh, it's entirely possible op's son may not have lived much longer (i don't know what they were in for... but a month-long stay is rarely a pleasant matter, to say the least.)\n\nthe BiL is the full on asshole, here.\n\nthe niece isn't an asshole because her feelings were hurt.,, rather because she was pretty freaking clueless to say something when they were visiting a kid who just got out of the hospital. still not a large one, enough i'd just move on.", "I don\u2019t think it shows she\u2019s less important. There was extenuating circumstances, her father took it too far. He told her it slipped her mind, like I said. Obviously, he would only be thinking about his son", "Yes he should have only been thinking of his son. She's still only 15. I know that doesn't seem young but trust me we do a lot of growing up in those years. Her father clearly isn't helping by telling her no one cares either. This would've been a great time to clear the air between him and his niece and just explain what happened and why. Everyone said she's old enough to understand but she hasn't been taught to do that yet (assuming from her father's reaction at least)"]}
