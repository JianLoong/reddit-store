If she was still hurt- maybe they could have thrown her a half birthday party in 6 months when your son was hopefully feeling better!!!", "NTA.\n\nEntitled and absolutely rude to put a birthday over caring for your son in the hospital.\n\nInsufferable AHs especially for the \"took everyone's attention\" remark.

The delusion.\nYou could expect it from a 15 year old, but her father? Really? When she mentioned her hurt feelings, it would have been a good time for him to teach her about empathy for others going through difficult situations, not jump on the bandwagon and uphold her understandable immaturity.\n\nI am shocked. A loved one spending a month in hospital is a very long time. A very scary time. As your family, you would expect support, not recriminations. And if they have an issue about the grandparents, they should bring that up with the grandparents, not with you. I am disgusted.", "NTA what an awful family.", "Yeah no. NTA.

NTA, obviously. Sounds like your niece takes after her dad.  For your BIL to be upset and say it's your fault the grandpa missed her birthday is so outrageously out of line.  You weren't forcing your dad to be anywhere, and you certainly aren't responsible for him remembering/not remembering a birthday.", "NTA.

It could have been an opportunity to acknowledge the hurt feelings, but also give a chance for niece to learn that sometimes in life, focus must shift to accommodate extenuating circumstances. A gentle conversation about that, could be instrumental in helping her gain some compassion. \n\nMaybe pull aside sis and BIL for a similar conversation. \n\nTo be clear, I think NTA. But left to the sole guidance of her father (& I can't tell if your sister behaves similarly), niece might turn out just like him.

It sounds like you were being too proud to apologize, and that never really helps anything. \n\nOn the other hand, her father was being a huge AH. He had zero sensitivity for your situation with your son. A sick or injured child is a miserable thing, and he's not considering how hard it is for a few days, let alone a month.

Given her father\u2019s participation in the exchange, it\u2019s no mystery whence that philosophy came. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable for her to have been disappointed and even upset by your absence, but her demand (obviously emboldened by her father) that you apologize to her for it is an act of extreme entitlement, and it displays frightening lacks of awareness and empathy.

And yes, a 15 yo can and do understand extenuating circumstances, but extenuating circumstances isn't a rug to sweep everything under either. Also all teenagers are rather psychopathic in nature, thinking only of their own survival.  \n\nNow your BIL does seem to have egged it on with his comment specifically \"taking everyone's attention for a month\" and \"making her grandfather miss her BDay\". Those are selfish and untrue statements and is very saddening that a full grown man of at least 30 years would make such comments especially with his teenage daughter present. Now we could say maybe he was just playing the over protective dad card and really wanted to show his daughter he was on her side but to say inherently untrue statements isn't an effective way to do that. Because no one can \"take\" our attention, we give it for the better or worse, also no one can make anyone do anything. Granddad missing the party was his choice and while it had to do with the circumstances you were in, it was his choice to make, and he made it on his own. \n\nNow on to why I think you're YTA here. Imaging being in her shoes. I don't need to image very hard as I've been in close proximity to it many times.

Validating someone's feelings is important at every age, but especially to those who have not reached the age of majority. \n\nNot wishing her a happy birthday was a mistake, an unintentional mistake but a mistake none the less. And it hurts no one, by your own admittance you agree, to apologize to say \"I'm sorry\" and no \" I'm sorry, but...\" \"I'm sorry, but\"s are not apologizes they are excuses. No human is infallible, we all stumble and fall and error, and this error hurt her feelings. I thinks she says it the most eloquently;\n\n>so you would rather us leave than acknowledge you hurt my feelings?\n\nThink about that. Think about what she is really saying. She understands you didn't forget her birthday with malicious intent or with a depraved heart, your mind was simply preoccupied by a rather unfortunate situation. However, now that the situation has calmed down some, it isn't going to cost you anything to say, \"hey I errored, and I'm sorry my error resulted in your feelings being hurt.\" In fact, admitting you made a mistake might just give you something, a closer relationship with your niece, or merely the returning of a lost piece of humanity.", "NTA, what is she, like five?

Instead you got pissy that your niece said you hurt her and that she was upset and tried to have open and honest conversation with her uncle. YTA for that. Your BiL is an AH for inistigating it to go further but they are clearly hurt that her and her birthday were forgotten by everyone for you and your son and that in an entire month she couldn\u2019t be remembered on one day, her birthday.

She sounds indulged and I don't think she's realised yet that she isn't automatically everyone's top priority on her birthday. Maybe because this was the first time something like this happened. \n\nUnfortunately, her main takeaway from the row is probably that her uncle was unsympathetic and dismissive when she voiced something that was important to her, rather than \"Oh, I understand now how seriously ill my cousin was, that hurting my feelings wasn't deliberate, and why my grandad needed to be at the hospital rather than my party on my birthday\". \n\nDon't beat yourself up for not responding in a saint-like fashion though.

You do too, when you have the bandwidth. She likely also spent a month worrying about her cousin, without really knowing what to do with all those emotions, and her mom's attention was likely pretty split between trying to care for her family and help with yours.

She didn't make a fuss when it happened. She waited till she saw him in person and his son was out of the hospital. I think she showed alot of maturity for a 15 yr old girl", "Haha what?? Psychotic for trying to have a healthy conversation instead of making a fuss when it happened?? The 15 yr old girl waited until she saw him in person and his son was no longer in the hospital. Everyone forgot about her for her birthday. Her feelings are valid. What is wrong with you people making all these assumptions?", "I feel like the 15 year old thinks the OP is capable of multitasking and sending a text from the hospital", "She probably did talk to her dad about it. Seeing how he reacted here, I don't think her reaction is all that bad. Could've been better, yes. But could've gone a lot worse. (Probably mom's influence that lessened it)", "Hell bent? She said something twice...", "Oh, OP's niece is behaving the most mature for their years of all three here. No question about it.", "Agree, it seems reasonable for the niece to bring it up now that it's a later date and the son is out of hospital. She's allowed to have feelings, and to be sad that her family forgot her birthday.", "Agreed. This is not an \u201capology required\u201d situation, because while the niece I\u2019m sure has genuine hurt feelings, the forgetting of the birthday was caused by EXTREME EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES that remove any \u201cfault\u201d or \u201cthoughtlessness\u201d from OP\u2019s account.", "Agree. If I were the OP I might get my niece a belated birthday card/gift. My her dad is an epic AH", "I agree with you. I find people a bit heartless towards the niece here. OP has a good reason to forget her on her birthday and to spend time with son in the hospital. But they are home now. Why is so hard to say \"I had to care for my son in the hospital, so couldn't make it. I would still happily celebrate with you another time though. I am not busy with son's health from date X. Maybe my son and your grandfather can join as well!\"\n\nThey definitely need to talk to BIL though, without niece. Pretty gross behaviour."]}
