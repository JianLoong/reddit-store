The delusion.\nYou could expect it from a 15 year old, but her father? Really? When she mentioned her hurt feelings, it would have been a good time for him to teach her about empathy for others going through difficult situations, not jump on the bandwagon and uphold her understandable immaturity.\n\nI am shocked. A loved one spending a month in hospital is a very long time. A very scary time. As your family, you would expect support, not recriminations. And if they have an issue about the grandparents, they should bring that up with the grandparents, not with you. I am disgusted.", "NTA what an awful family.", "Yeah no. NTA.

NTA, obviously. Sounds like your niece takes after her dad.  For your BIL to be upset and say it's your fault the grandpa missed her birthday is so outrageously out of line.  You weren't forcing your dad to be anywhere, and you certainly aren't responsible for him remembering/not remembering a birthday.", "NTA.

It could have been an opportunity to acknowledge the hurt feelings, but also give a chance for niece to learn that sometimes in life, focus must shift to accommodate extenuating circumstances. A gentle conversation about that, could be instrumental in helping her gain some compassion. \n\nMaybe pull aside sis and BIL for a similar conversation. \n\nTo be clear, I think NTA. But left to the sole guidance of her father (& I can't tell if your sister behaves similarly), niece might turn out just like him.

It sounds like you were being too proud to apologize, and that never really helps anything. \n\nOn the other hand, her father was being a huge AH. He had zero sensitivity for your situation with your son. A sick or injured child is a miserable thing, and he's not considering how hard it is for a few days, let alone a month.

Given her father\u2019s participation in the exchange, it\u2019s no mystery whence that philosophy came. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable for her to have been disappointed and even upset by your absence, but her demand (obviously emboldened by her father) that you apologize to her for it is an act of extreme entitlement, and it displays frightening lacks of awareness and empathy.

And yes, a 15 yo can and do understand extenuating circumstances, but extenuating circumstances isn't a rug to sweep everything under either. Also all teenagers are rather psychopathic in nature, thinking only of their own survival.  \n\nNow your BIL does seem to have egged it on with his comment specifically \"taking everyone's attention for a month\" and \"making her grandfather miss her BDay\". Those are selfish and untrue statements and is very saddening that a full grown man of at least 30 years would make such comments especially with his teenage daughter present. Now we could say maybe he was just playing the over protective dad card and really wanted to show his daughter he was on her side but to say inherently untrue statements isn't an effective way to do that. Because no one can \"take\" our attention, we give it for the better or worse, also no one can make anyone do anything. Granddad missing the party was his choice and while it had to do with the circumstances you were in, it was his choice to make, and he made it on his own. \n\nNow on to why I think you're YTA here. Imaging being in her shoes. I don't need to image very hard as I've been in close proximity to it many times.

Validating someone's feelings is important at every age, but especially to those who have not reached the age of majority. \n\nNot wishing her a happy birthday was a mistake, an unintentional mistake but a mistake none the less. And it hurts no one, by your own admittance you agree, to apologize to say \"I'm sorry\" and no \" I'm sorry, but...\" \"I'm sorry, but\"s are not apologizes they are excuses. No human is infallible, we all stumble and fall and error, and this error hurt her feelings. I thinks she says it the most eloquently;\n\n>so you would rather us leave than acknowledge you hurt my feelings?\n\nThink about that. Think about what she is really saying. She understands you didn't forget her birthday with malicious intent or with a depraved heart, your mind was simply preoccupied by a rather unfortunate situation. However, now that the situation has calmed down some, it isn't going to cost you anything to say, \"hey I errored, and I'm sorry my error resulted in your feelings being hurt.\" In fact, admitting you made a mistake might just give you something, a closer relationship with your niece, or merely the returning of a lost piece of humanity.", "NTA, what is she, like five?

Instead you got pissy that your niece said you hurt her and that she was upset and tried to have open and honest conversation with her uncle. YTA for that. Your BiL is an AH for inistigating it to go further but they are clearly hurt that her and her birthday were forgotten by everyone for you and your son and that in an entire month she couldn\u2019t be remembered on one day, her birthday.

She sounds indulged and I don't think she's realised yet that she isn't automatically everyone's top priority on her birthday. Maybe because this was the first time something like this happened. \n\nUnfortunately, her main takeaway from the row is probably that her uncle was unsympathetic and dismissive when she voiced something that was important to her, rather than \"Oh, I understand now how seriously ill my cousin was, that hurting my feelings wasn't deliberate, and why my grandad needed to be at the hospital rather than my party on my birthday\". \n\nDon't beat yourself up for not responding in a saint-like fashion though.

You do too, when you have the bandwidth. She likely also spent a month worrying about her cousin, without really knowing what to do with all those emotions, and her mom's attention was likely pretty split between trying to care for her family and help with yours.

She clearly does not blame the child for being sick otherwise it would have been more of an outburst when he was around. They had a game plan for the daughter to stand up for herself to OP about how it made her feel and asked for an apology. Is it a understandable that they forgot about it yes.

His sister did so much for him and his son, why is it ok for him to be a complete selfish jerk to her and not ok for the sister who\u2019s been sacrificing herself for a month to get upset when her kid doesn\u2019t even get a spare thought for three seconds?", "I think people are really over reacting and being defensive on this post.

It was honestly immature for her to bring this up to OP at all.\n\nThere's a concept I've seen in psychology called circles of impact (I think). It basically describes who you can go to for support in the case of an emergency. For example, if someone is hospitalized, it would be inappropriate for their second cousin to start telling the person's spouse about how upset they are about the illness, but the cousin might talk to their own spouse about it. In this case everyone was affected by the tragedy of OP's son's car crash, but OP and her son were at the epicenter of the tragedy, so they should not have been responsible for supporting people who were less effected by the tragedy. OP's niece was much less affected, so she should have gone to someone else (her parents, friends, etc.) to express her emotions.\n\nOf course this is all a little high concept for a 15 year old, but I'm not saying she should have known about this psychological concept.
