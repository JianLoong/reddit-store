{"id": 6589, "submission_id": "104f97g", "title": "AITA for not wanting to engage with my niece about her birthday?", "selftext": "My niece's birthday is in mid-December. My son was in the hospital almost the entire month of December. During that time I rarely went anywhere except for work and occasionally home to get clean clothes. My dad and sister also frequently came over to help with things, bring food, sit with him while I took a shower, things like that.\n\nI did not attend my niece's birthday, wasn't even thinking about it at all. I also forgot to text her happy birthday. My dad also missed her birthday because he was helping with stuff at the hospital. So no one from her mom's side of the family was there, except for her mom.\n\nNow that my son is back home, my sister and her husband brought my niece to visit. At one point after my son fell asleep, my niece said to me \"just so you know, it really hurt my feelings that you didn't wish me a happy birthday, not even a text.\" I was a little miffed that she would hold onto something like that when my son and I just went through something horrible, but birthdays are a big deal when you are fifteen. So I just said \"It slipped my mind. Happy birthday.\"\n\nMy brother-in-law said \"she was pretty upset no one from your side of the family was there.\" I just stared at him for a second. \"Yeah, I was at the hospital, with my son. Kind of weird that you forgot that.\"\n\nHe said \"I didn't forget, but you took over everyone's attention for a month. I don't think it's too much to ask that you apologize to my daughter for making her grandfather miss her birthday.\" My sister said that we should talk about something else, but I said I thought it would be better to cut the visit short, since my son was already asleep anyway.\n\nMy niece said \"so you would rather us leave than acknowledge you hurt my feelings?\" I said yes. My sister gave me a hug and said they would visit at a better time, but her husband said \"don't worry, honey, your uncle is just a jerk. It's nothing to do with you.\" Then they left.\n\nNow, could I have apologized for missing her birthday and technically being the reason my dad did? Sure. Should I have? She's fifteen. One would think she's old enough to understand extenuating circumstances. Is that an unrealistic expectation?\n\nUpdate: Thanks to all the people that weighed in and gave me perspective on this situation. Between caring for my son and work, I haven't been able to read every comment. However, I have read a decent sampling, and all the diverse opinions helped me to sort through my thoughts. I'll address a few common statements and then tell you what I decided to do.\n\nI know it is difficult to comprehend what a situation like this entails if you've never been in it. Several people have told me to take my niece out to dinner and this will all blow over. I am now the primary caretaker of a disabled child alongside working a full-time job. I am in massive medical debt and will probably be filing bankruptcy in the near future. Taking people out to dinner is not in any sense a realistic proposal. I have a time deficit and a money deficit.\n\nA lot of commentors also made mention of my sister and her parenting in a negative light. My sister is an amazing person and mother. Despite what I might be feeling towards her husband right now, she is the world's greatest big sister, and I am blessed to have her in my life. She came through for me in so many ways during all of this, as she has many times before in my life. That brings me to my decision.\n\nI made the difficult judgement call that I didn't have the appropriate emotional resources right now to handle this conflict without potentially causing further rifts in the family. I wrote my sister an email expressing my gratitude to and love for her. I then explained that I am going to be limiting contact with her husband and daughter temporarily while I handle the situation with my son. I don't have the emotional strength right now to address the issue with them and be 100% confident that I won't say something I might later regret. I told her that however she needs to handle my decision I will accept and respect.\n\nI just sent the email, and I am nervous. Even with everything going on right now, I am scared of possibly losing my closeness with my sister. My son is my main priority though, and I have to focus on him. Thank you to everyone for your perspectives. The wide variety of responses helped balanced me, and some of you might be the reason I didn't make a big mistake like calling up my brother-in-law and cussing him out. Things will be difficult moving forward, but I have hope that they will improve with time.", "created_utc": 1672964668, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104f97g/aita_for_not_wanting_to_engage_with_my_niece/", "score": 5134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She doesn't have the life experience to truly understand what you and your family have gone through. In her head you weren't the one sick so why did you forget about her?\n\nHer parents on the other hand are HUGE assholes for not correcting her when she brought it up and then not explaining to her the reason why people were busy was someone was very sick. If she was still hurt- maybe they could have thrown her a half birthday party in 6 months when your son was hopefully feeling better!!!", "NTA.\n\nEntitled and absolutely rude to put a birthday over caring for your son in the hospital.\n\nInsufferable AHs especially for the \"took everyone's attention\" remark.

Bringing it to your house like that without talking to you first was ridiculous. And immature.", "NTA. For gods sake, your son was in the hospital. She is completely entitled and so is BIL. Her emotions don\u2019t need to be validated, she needs to learn some empathy and that she isn\u2019t the center of the universe. She is gonna have a hard time as an adult if she continues to act like this.", "NTA- wow, just wow. \nThe entitlement. The self-importance. The delusion.\nYou could expect it from a 15 year old, but her father? Really? When she mentioned her hurt feelings, it would have been a good time for him to teach her about empathy for others going through difficult situations, not jump on the bandwagon and uphold her understandable immaturity.\n\nI am shocked. A loved one spending a month in hospital is a very long time. A very scary time. As your family, you would expect support, not recriminations. And if they have an issue about the grandparents, they should bring that up with the grandparents, not with you. I am disgusted.", "NTA what an awful family.", "Yeah no. NTA. Your own child being in the hospital trumps everything else. I can see where the niece gets it from with her father\u2019s response.", "This is why YTA. You couldn't even validate her feelings that her grandpa didn't remember her birthday.\n\n\n>\"so you would rather us leave than acknowledge you hurt my feelings?\" I said yes.", "first I'm glad your son is home and I hope he is doing well. being 15 and being able to understand situations doesn't prevent them from getting their feelings hurt by not being acknowledged on their birthday.  as you said you could have said you were sorry, but you chose not to, that alone makes you YTA. you  were there, they were there, it would been nice if you thought of their feelings a bit now that your emergency was over.", "yikes. NTA, obviously. Sounds like your niece takes after her dad.  For your BIL to be upset and say it's your fault the grandpa missed her birthday is so outrageously out of line.  You weren't forcing your dad to be anywhere, and you certainly aren't responsible for him remembering/not remembering a birthday.", "NTA.  I'd have a very serious conversation with your sister about how you'll continue a relationship with her, but you'll never be in the same room with her asshole of a husband again.  \n\nAlso, how old is your niece??", "While you're not the parent, 15 is a highly impressionable age. It could have been an opportunity to acknowledge the hurt feelings, but also give a chance for niece to learn that sometimes in life, focus must shift to accommodate extenuating circumstances. A gentle conversation about that, could be instrumental in helping her gain some compassion. \n\nMaybe pull aside sis and BIL for a similar conversation. \n\nTo be clear, I think NTA. But left to the sole guidance of her father (& I can't tell if your sister behaves similarly), niece might turn out just like him.

This is awful behavior from him and it's not your fault your dad didn't remember. \n\n\n>My niece said \"so you would rather us leave than acknowledge you hurt my feelings?\" I said yes.\n\nQuit taking out your anger on your niece.

One would think she's old enough to understand extenuating circumstances. Is that an unrealistic expectation\n\nIt wouldn't have hurt you to say \"sorry I forgot your bday. I have a lot going on right now and it's not about you, I'm sorry.\" She's fifteen and you're an adult. Quit projecting your issues and deal with them like an adult. \nYou're not TA for having them leave because BIL was being a jerk. \nyou need to learn to keep your arguments with BIL between you and him and not drag a child into it. \nI'm sure you're hurting right now but that's nobody's fault and taking it out on everyone isn't going to encourage anyone to support you.", "Your BIL/niece are WAY out of line and very callous.

And yes, a 15 yo can and do understand extenuating circumstances, but extenuating circumstances isn't a rug to sweep everything under either. Also all teenagers are rather psychopathic in nature, thinking only of their own survival.  \n\nNow your BIL does seem to have egged it on with his comment specifically \"taking everyone's attention for a month\" and \"making her grandfather miss her BDay\". Those are selfish and untrue statements and is very saddening that a full grown man of at least 30 years would make such comments especially with his teenage daughter present. Now we could say maybe he was just playing the over protective dad card and really wanted to show his daughter he was on her side but to say inherently untrue statements isn't an effective way to do that. Because no one can \"take\" our attention, we give it for the better or worse, also no one can make anyone do anything. Granddad missing the party was his choice and while it had to do with the circumstances you were in, it was his choice to make, and he made it on his own. \n\nNow on to why I think you're YTA here. Imaging being in her shoes. I don't need to image very hard as I've been in close proximity to it many times.

Validating someone's feelings is important at every age, but especially to those who have not reached the age of majority. \n\nNot wishing her a happy birthday was a mistake, an unintentional mistake but a mistake none the less. And it hurts no one, by your own admittance you agree, to apologize to say \"I'm sorry\" and no \" I'm sorry, but...\" \"I'm sorry, but\"s are not apologizes they are excuses. No human is infallible, we all stumble and fall and error, and this error hurt her feelings. I thinks she says it the most eloquently;\n\n>so you would rather us leave than acknowledge you hurt my feelings?\n\nThink about that. Think about what she is really saying. She understands you didn't forget her birthday with malicious intent or with a depraved heart, your mind was simply preoccupied by a rather unfortunate situation. However, now that the situation has calmed down some, it isn't going to cost you anything to say, \"hey I errored, and I'm sorry my error resulted in your feelings being hurt.\" In fact, admitting you made a mistake might just give you something, a closer relationship with your niece, or merely the returning of a lost piece of humanity.", "NTA, what is she, like five?

Instead you got pissy that your niece said you hurt her and that she was upset and tried to have open and honest conversation with her uncle. YTA for that. Your BiL is an AH for inistigating it to go further but they are clearly hurt that her and her birthday were forgotten by everyone for you and your son and that in an entire month she couldn\u2019t be remembered on one day, her birthday.

She sounds indulged and I don't think she's realised yet that she isn't automatically everyone's top priority on her birthday.

You do too, when you have the bandwidth. She likely also spent a month worrying about her cousin, without really knowing what to do with all those emotions, and her mom's attention was likely pretty split between trying to care for her family and help with yours.

So this probably feels like a harder blow with that context than it who\u2019d have otherwise. \n\nYour BIL was definitely out of line, but do I think you could have offered a more compassionate response to your niece? Yes, you could have. She tried to be honest with you and let you know she was upset, and you were dismissive of that. It\u2019s ironic that you won\u2019t validate your nieces feelings but yours were hurt enough to kick them out. \n\nI hope your father has been more compassionate to her. \n\nI\u2019m glad your son is doing better, I wish him and you well. \nBut would it really be so terrible to send your niece a text explaining you do care about her, but your worry about your son overwhelmed you?", "It would have cost him nothing to acknowledge and verbalise that to the niece, though.

Reassuring her that her moms side of the family being absent during something that is important to her at that point in her life was not personal and that you guys still cared for her would have gone a long way and you could have avoided the entire argument.\n\nYour niece is completely innocent in this, yet the fact that you allow random anonymous people on the internet berate her like this does not reflect well on you as an uncle at all, and kind of gives away the fact that you want people to enable your own sense of righteousness rather than a genuine inquiry into who was wrong in this situation.", "My daughter was super jealous of all the attention her brother got when he was repeatedly admitted to hospital and had all the fun tubes and machines attached to him. *But she was 3.*", "You'd think.

Psychotic for trying to have a healthy conversation instead of making a fuss when it happened?? The 15 yr old girl waited until she saw him in person and his son was no longer in the hospital. Everyone forgot about her for her birthday. Her feelings are valid. What is wrong with you people making all these assumptions?", "I feel like the 15 year old thinks the OP is capable of multitasking and sending a text from the hospital", "She probably did talk to her dad about it.

She said something twice...", "Oh, OP's niece is behaving the most mature for their years of all three here. No question about it.", "Agree, it seems reasonable for the niece to bring it up now that it's a later date and the son is out of hospital.

This is not an \u201capology required\u201d situation, because while the niece I\u2019m sure has genuine hurt feelings, the forgetting of the birthday was caused by EXTREME EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES that remove any \u201cfault\u201d or \u201cthoughtlessness\u201d from OP\u2019s account.", "Agree. If I were the OP I might get my niece a belated birthday card/gift. her dad is an epic AH", "I agree with you. I find people a bit heartless towards the niece here.

Its hard, and the first time is especially traumatizing. But im guessing at some point between your nieces birthday and them visiting you had to remember it and still never texted her. She didn't harass you with messages while you were in the hospital with your son. She didn't call you an AH. She straight up told you you hurt her feelings and instead of acknowledging her feelings you got \"miffed\" and gave her a pathetic Happy Birthday. Cuz honestly, you sound entitled as hell. The whole \"I don't have to be responsible for anything else cuz MY SON was in the hospital and everyone else needs to understand and get over it.\"  You forgetting her birthday might seem trivial to you and I'm sure you forgetting the day off was understandable to her too, but you never even reached out. How hard is it to say \"dear niece I'm sorry about your birthday but I know you understand considering the circumstances and I'll try to make it up to you in the future.\" You had like what, 3 weeks to reach out?

I genuinely recommend you seek counseling before you destroy your relationship with your niece or any other family member. You have a lot going on and something terrible happened to THE most dearest person to you. However, you were one of the lucky ones and I say that only because your child was able to come home in the end. People have walked in your shoes and lost their child. People have lost everything. Your pain does not give you the right to disregard and be cruelly indifferent to your loved ones (that is assuming you actually love your niece). Your BIL was incredibly rude but your niece deserved better than that. She\u2019s still a child too.

She didn\u2019t throw a fit or even confront you during the time your son was sick, but wanted to let you know you hurt her. As an adult you should be mature enough to say you are sorry, you were afraid your son was going to die (I hope he is doing better), but you\u2019ll take her to the movies or something to celebrate her. \n\nShe was probably an entitled little shit but younger family members tend to be little shits. I don\u2019t know the way you wrote this is very problematic. Writing 10+ \u201cmy\u201d 10+ \u201cI\u201d makes me think your centring December and the players around yourself in your head.

She didn't get hurt because you were prioritizing your son, she was hurt because you missed her birthday and didn't acknowledge her feelings. This could be easy be solved if you didn't get defensive at first and just talked like a grown adult and said that you were focusing all of your time with your son and you didn't have time to remember it, that that doesn't mean you don't love her and you didn't want to hurt her feelings", "I'll go against the grain but ESH your BIL mostly, but you too. \n\nYour niece is 15 and she explained her feelings very well. You could have said sorry, it was free, and then you could have proceed with reminded her why you forgot. She would have feel better, and she would have been open to understand your point of view.

Your niece might not understand how her cousin was in the hospital, or understand the seriousness, etc. A lot of teenagers have very little or no situational awareness. DO NOT undermine your apology by saying, \u201coh it slipped my mind because my son was in the hospital\u2019 because your niece might take that very personally. \nKids do pick up a lot of things from their parents.

Instead of being \u201cmiffed\u201d genuinely apologize and talk about her hurt feelings. She\u2019s IS allowed to hold on to you forgetting and hurting her feelings. You do not get to dictate what others are feeling are more important or hold more weight compared to your own and situations. That\u2019s actually quite mature of her to want to talk to you about how she is feeling. She even waited for your son to be asleep as to not overhear.  We often forget that life keeps moving outside the hospital. And that others still need us to listen and care about them as well. It\u2019s hard to do. It feels like nothing can compare to what you are going through. But it\u2019s the truth. You, however, are not responsible for your dad/ her grandfather and her dad was definitely adding fuel to the flame. \nTalk to your niece. Away from her parents. Listen to her.

However,  as a grown ass adult, you can't hear a teenager telling you that you hurt her feelings and be big enough to say sorry? Obviously your child was your priority at the time but you can still say \"sorry, I know it sucks that you got forgotten during all of that\" - it's really not hard. That teenager is more emotionally mature than you are.", "YTA. I understand why you forgot her birthday but you came across like you didn\u2019t give a shit about her. I\u2019ve been in the hospital a lot from multiple chronic illnesses so this is a world I\u2019m familiar with. I don\u2019t think your son being in the hospital means you get to act like everyone else is just dirt on the ground you walk on. You hurt her feelings and you should have apologized. Unless she doesn\u2019t really matter you to. Which it doesn\u2019t seem like you do. Her dad should be helping her understand why things may have been overlooked but you are acting like the whole world revolves around you and only your feelings matter. I would be embarrassed if my family treated each other this way while I was sick.", "YTA it's not so difficult to say 'sorry I was a little bit preoccupied' instead you keep insisting that she is old enough to understand. Of course she is, doesn't mean you don't have to apologize though. 15 is smack middle in puberty and you can have some crazy thoughts at that age, certainly if no-one from a certain group is showing up for your birthday or even acknowledging the birthday, for whatever valid reason. \n\nAnd yes your BIL was a jerk too but he is also a parent. He was probably hurt by seeing his child being mentally hurt and stood up for her when he saw that you weren't acknowledging her hurt.

Your BIL was also an AH for escalating the situation, mainly because that did nothing to help his child.

That feeling she had was definitely one of those.", "I believe he could have them leave because they were getting rude. Yes, she communicated her feelings, that's good and he answered her.

It still upsets me and it's been at least 10 years, probably more. \n\nShe doesn't hold a grudge about it. She's upset that she forgot us, of course, but she had so much more on her mind and she made sure that we knew that, that it wasn't about us, that she still loves us. She wants to be able to take it back, but she also needed us to understand why she couldn't. \n\n*Thats* the correct response. And through all that, my mother listened to me being hurt and angry and upset, and she protected my grandmother. She told us that we were loved, that grandmom was busy, that we were capable of walking home because sometimes things get messed up. \n\n\nBoth responses from OP and BIL were messed up, because they hurt a child, but BIL absolutely handled this the worst way possible.

Sometimes things come up and as she gets older she'll realize it, but she's still a kid (Hell, I didn't even celebrate my 30th because I was out of town for a month for work). The BIL though is a real piece of work for instead trying to push things rather than making this a teaching moment for his daughter (that she can be upset, but in life some things do have to take priority but it doesn't mean she matters less, and they can always celebrate her birthday another time with everyone when things smooth over).", "I'm going to disagree with everyone here and say YTA. \n\nNow, you're not an asshole for forgetting, what you were going through makes that understandable, but you still hurt someone's feelings.

Everyone should be considerate about what your son is going through AND yes you should have apologized for missing her party and forgetting to send her a simple text to let her n is you were thinking of her.\n\nThe only person who isn\u2019t an A here is your son, your sister and her child.", "I\u2019m gonna get downvoted to bell for this, but soft ESH, except your niece. Your niece is okay for feeling hurt at being forgotten, but your BIL is an AH for instigating, and you\u2019re an AH very gently for forgetting. At the end of the day there were extenuating circumstances, but this sub isn\u2019t for whether you were in the right or not, but whether what you did sucked, and I don\u2019t think you can deny that it did suck. Maybe just apologise, wish her a happy birthday, and put it in your calendar so you don\u2019t forget again, or get her something nice or do something to show her that you haven\u2019t forgotten her. \n\nI understand you were with your son, and I\u2019m really sorry about his hospitalisation, but I think every child deserves to be recognised and validated, even if it requires a little attention and energy on your part.", "YTA, I get everything you\u2019re saying but sending a literal 30 sec text isn\u2019t hard to do. Also she\u2019s a child, you could have said sorry with your cousin being in the hospital everything was hectic instead of it slipped my mind. You\u2019re being rude and childish but expecting a child to be the nature adult. She didn\u2019t seem mad at you but like she said it hurt her feelings. How hard is it to acknowledge that? Especially when it was an entire side of a family and not just cousins parents.", "> I do have to say, you kinda suck for saying \"shes old enough to understand\" you never get too old to get hurt over being forgotten.\n\nUm. What?\n\nNo. Whether you are 5, 15 or 55 you are old enough to understand that your uncle\u2019s priority is taking care of your cousin when he is sick enough to be hospitalized. \n\nYou completed a revolution around the sun, not vice versa. JFC.", "his sister tried to change the subject but BIL kept pushing.", ">>My niece said \"so you would rather us leave than acknowledge you hurt my feelings?\" I said yes.\n\n>Quit taking out your anger on your niece.\n\n\nGet the fuck out of here with this bullshit. That was clearly an attempt to emotionally manipulate OP. OP was not in the wrong to answer the way he did to that question. If niece wants to play that game then she can get the fuck out too.", "Someone's going to say, \"But they were at home, no longer in the hospital! Crisis averted!\"\n\nAfter a traumatic experience you just don't bounce back to normalcy. For the BIL and niece to visit and say 'Now that you're not in a place of extreme worry and distr3ss, let me tell how I hurt I was that you ignored me while you were...in a state of extreme distress.\" Its in very poor taste and extremely self centered.", "I truly don\u2019t understand everyone shitting on the niece. She expressed her feelings more maturely than any of these so-called adults. OP can offer an apology for hurting her feelings even while acknowledging he couldn\u2019t have done anything differently while so over capacity with his son.", "I don\u2019t think the kid did anything wrong here, she was communicating about how she felt. Dad was def TA and mom wasn\u2019t TA but she should\u2019ve told the daughter that her uncle had a lot going on and it isn\u2019t because that she wanted to hurt him, he just had a really rough time.", "What audacity?? She literally just expressed some very valid feelings for a child to have, she doesn\u2019t sound angry, she just wants her feelings to be acknowledged. Which takes literally nothing from OP who is supposedly an adult to just say \u201cI\u2019m sorry I hurt your feelings. I was so over capacity but I really love you\u201d", "\"I'm sorry my son was hurt and that your birthday was ruined because my son almost died.  Next time I will make sure he is in the hospital at a time that does not conflict with your special day.\" \n\nWould that work?", "Everyone seems to be reacting like she said this while the kid was still in the hospital fighting for his life. Like you said, she waited until an appropriate moment. I think BIL came in a little hot, but we don't know OP's tone.", "Poor OP probably has PTSD from his son being in hospital for so long.  It's going to take a while for him to get back to normal. \nHis BIL has no idea of what hes just been through - zero empathy .\n\nI have to wonder if the niece visited her cousin in hospital or sent a card or gift?  If not, holy hell is she selfish.\n\nNTA.", "He doesn\u2019t need to apologize. He has no reason to. He had a legit reason to forget.", "Neice needs to apologize to OP for making tgings abput her when OP's son was dying. What a brat.", "He didn\u2019t have the emotional bandwidth to remember to call. You\u2019re insensitive and petty. She wasn\u2019t ignored by everyone just the person who was in crisis. I hope you\u2019re never in such a situation to learn how off base you are.", "I mean it wouldve been a bit better but he didn't even add the last part there lol. He just said \"it slipped my mind. Happy birthday.\" I doubt she heard that as \"my kid was dying and I couldn't focus on anything else\" but more as \"I didn't care and still don't\" cause that's what it sounds like to a kid/teen.", "That's not maturity. I was in a similar situation at that age and I couldn't imagine confronting my relatives like that. It's selfish.", "Totally agree, I also think it would of been fine for OP\u2019s sister to made text her and say I know you\u2019re overwhelmed in hospital but can you drop a HB text to your niece. \n\nMy niece\u2019s think the world of me so even a little text would of made their birthday even if I was going through something that OP was with their son.", "Yes and he acknowledged by saying it slipped my mind happy Birthday. An apology isn\u2019t necessary when you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. It\u2019s not OPs fault his niece could not understand extenuating circumstances and that her father made it worse. Sounds like OPs sister is the only one with any sense.", "Disagree. Her cousin was in the hospital for a MONTH? That means he must have been severely ill or injured. If she, at 15, still thinks her birthday, which comes around every year, should be more important than her cousin's life, she's terribly self centered and her parents are equally out of line centering her birthday over their nephew's illness. \n\nOP is NTA--but he's got a passel of AH relatives.", "She\u2019s doing amazing now thank you! And yeah. Sadly that\u2019s what it seems like. Like I said at first I thought maybe it was anxiety at first. It wasn\u2019t until she was doing things like calling her doctor saying she hadn\u2019t felt movement in over 24 hrs (when she actually had) just so she could get an ultrasound that I started to question things. And it kinda sealed the deal for me when she was pregnant with her last and admitted to getting pregnant so soon so she could have a c section. She was pretty bummed when I said since all of hers were vaginal that she wasn\u2019t going to have one just because her last two are a year apart. My two kids are a year (accident) apart and my second was completely healthy but since I just had a c section a year ago, it was my best option for my second to avoid major complications.", "Some people were never taught the difference between positive and negative attention when they were children and it shows.\n\nI recall only one teacher ever bringing it up and calling out negative attention for what it was. Others would minimize, ignore, deflect, victim blame. All I can assume is that a majority of people go through life never introspecting the difference until or unless they hit some kind of rock bottom and it finally clicks", "Not everyone. Just the people who were preoccupied with a hospitalized child.", "Bringing it up when OPs son was literally just out of the hospital, most likely still not fully recovered from his injuries and still trying to process everything that had happened and is still happening was *not* the best time to bring it up at all. OP has only just got his son home after a month long stay in hospital while not knowing whether or not his son would leave the hospital alive, so mentally and emotionally he's not in a good place at all and I don't blame him for his reaction, especially when he's being accused of \"hogging all the family attention\" and being blamed for his father, who was helping OP while he was going through an extremely traumatic event in his life for also missing the niece's birthday.\n\nUnless \"maybe when son is more recovered and you're mentally in a better place we can have a belated celebration\" was added it shouldn't have been mentioned at all at that time.\n\nThat was not the time or the place for such a confrontation.", "It\u2019s really super fucking easy to forget to send a text when you\u2019re busy, or, you know, completely overwhelmed by the near death and recovery of your child.", "Let's not forget she also has a mid december birthday, which means her birthday is probably overlooked by her friends so half the family not being present for the celebration has greater significance for her.  \n\n\nAlso I think niece's behavior of waiting for an appropriate moment and letting OP know how she felt is far healthier than her walking around with hurt feelings and possibly coming to resent OP and his son.", "Exactly, thank you. Jfc the way some people are acting here you'd think OP missed his niece birthday because he went on an annual 3 week bender, not because his child was in the hospital on the brink of death.\n\nNo doubt her father has been filling her head with bs too, but this is something that didn't even need to be brought up. It's not like OP misses her birthday every year or that he ignored it intentionally ffs.", "I agree with this. Parents failed in this instance. OP isn't TA.", "Girl: \u201cIt hurt my feelings that you son was in the hospital and you were so concerned about and drained by keeping him alive that you forgot to make me feel special.

Maybe, I dunno, the niece's parents should have modeled that long before the visit happened.", "At 15, I understood enough that some people can't celebrate my birthday and that's ok.  The year I turned 14, my mom was in a year long deep depression where she didn't leave her bedroom.  I didn't think I was going to get a party because we were on 1 income and my mom was lost in her own head.  A friend ended up sharing her birthday bash with me and I said nothing to my parents because I knew it wasn't malicious and they were trying their best.", "But were you the parent in that situation? I have also been in this situation many times with different family members, but the worst would be my child. I wouldn't have the capacity to do anything else but hope and obsess over what got us here, if id ever see her walk or even open her eyes again. It would be the darkest time of any parents life.

He is also a main character in this story.", "I agree with everything you\u2019ve said here. If he really values this relationship with his niece, OP could have been a little kinder and responded more like you suggest. \n\nBut I also think that OP is NTA for not having the energy to be that gracious after his ordeal. I also think the kid is NTA for not understanding. Her parents should be the ones that are explaining to her what a hard time OP is going through and how to give people grace in these situations. Nieces parents are the AHs.", "God that\u2019s even worse. A birthday doesn\u2019t trump my child sick in the hospital.

People are mistaking being narcissistic with emotional intelligence and it\u2019s baffling!", "It would cost nothing to just say \"I'm sorry, that must have felt really bad. I didn't forget because I don't love you, life has just been very hard recently.\" Remember, the niece didn't even ask outright for an apology. She was just trying to be open and honest. She wasn't even allowed to visit them in the hospital-- I'm sure she was worried and missing her cousin too. OP went straight into passive-aggressive defensive mode. Not a full blown ah, but kind of crappy. Kids are weird. Be willing to acknowledge if they're hurt and help them unpack those feelings.", "Yes she actually sounds great.", "Well, she certainly expected something more from OP.  That manipulative comment she made at the end was not needed.  If it had ended after OP kicked them out for niece just expressing her hurt, then yea, maybe I'd call OP the a h, but OP kicked them out after BIL went on a crazy rant blaming OP and their kid for other people's actions. Niece oversimplifying the situation as 'OP doesn't care about my feelings!' instead of 'OP was very stressed about their kid and forgot my birthday, but wished me one once they saw me' was very manipulative.", "Right, I'm soooooo upset that YOUR'RE the one in the hospital!  It should be me!  WTF?", "I feel like the major issue is the BIL has been egging on and possibly even started the comments to OPs niece regarding her birthday and was definitely instigating things. If he was decent he would have explained to OP's niece the situation' validated her feelings and moved on without bothering OP. But he probably did the complete opposite and pherhaps even remarked oh wow your grandfather and your uncle didn't even acknowledge ypur birthday and probably bitched all the time about \"the attention\". BIL is absolutely the asshole, the biggest asshole.", "I would add probably  op is completely  exhausted  if not depressed/I'm a very bad mental  state  still and probably  hasn't  yet had time to process  everything  that happened  emotionally  so to expect  'normal ' behavior  from op at this time makes whoever  does an ah.\nI bet he's still functioning  on automatic  settings  =just does what is needed  without  being  able to think at this time.

OP acknowledged that they forgot.  The reason they finally asked the family to leave was because BIL blamed a stressed out parent and an almost dead kid for their grandfather's decisions.  I was in this position at 14, except it was my mom who was in a year long depression stint (suicidal and isolated in her room)  and my dad was working like crazy to keep the bills paid.

But both of you had a good reason.\n\n*At one point after my son fell asleep, my niece said to me \"just so you know, it really hurt my feelings that you didn't wish me a happy birthday, not even a text.\" My brother-in-law said \"she was pretty upset no one from your side of the family was there.\" I just stared at him for a second. \"Yeah, I was at the hospital, with my son. Kind of weird that you forgot that.\"*  \n*He said \"I didn't forget, but you took over everyone's attention for a month. I don't think it's too much to ask that you apologize to my daughter for making her grandfather miss her birthday.  My niece said \"so you would rather us leave than acknowledge you hurt my feelings?\" I said yes.*\n\nI would get your sister and her family together and say \"I'm sorry that I missed your birthday and didn't go to your party. As you may have forgotten, my son was in the hospital fighting for his life and I was primarily focused on taking care of my son. I'm sorry that I didn't find the time to text you as I was going back and forth to the hospital, dealing with doctors and other medical things while trying to hold it together. I'm sorry that you feel that my son's illness held everyone's attention for a month. Do you think that I planned it that way? I can't speak for my father- maybe he should have gone to your birthday party. I could have come as well but then you'd probably would have berated me for not being happy for you or spending too much time worrying about my son. I only hope that you never have to spend a month in the hospital and your father never has to think about anything more than hoping that you get well. Now where is my acknowledgement that you hurt my feelings by insinuating that my focus on caring for my ill son somehow means that I care less for you?\"\n\nYour niece and her father need to know that sometimes, even when it is your special day, that things may happen that overshadow it. Your child's illness was one of those situations. Instead of being understanding, she was put out by that. You might also want to point out to your BIL that if the situations were reversed, you would not expect him to attend a party for your son.", "NTA at all.", "NTA. Yeah, it's upsetting but they have to realize that you can't leave your son at the hospital just to not hurt your niece's feelings.", "Your BIL is the AH, and is training your niece to be one too. Even a teenager should be more concerned about their hospitalized cousin than their birthday.", "NTA", "NTA for none of it. she's 15 and beyond old enough to realize the world doesn't revolve around her. she got her \"happy birthday\" in the end. won't be surprised when she ends up like her loser of a father", "NTA because you've got a valid reason for ditching that party.", "I think BIL is the biggest AH. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear he\u2019s fueling his daughter\u2019s feelings about it. Niece is a bit of an AH, but she is acting her age tbh. Hopefully she\u2019ll be better as she gets older. BIL needs to grow up though and learn some damn empathy.", "NTA\n\nShe's 15, time for her to realize her birthday isn't an important day to people not her.  And to understand that sick child trumps Birfmass stuff.", "NTA and as a parent I would be horrified if my 15yo said that. If your son was in the hospital that long,it must have been serious, hope things are going well. Next time, tell them your feelings were hurt they had a party while he was in the hospital.", "NTA.\n\nBIL is raising niece to be a pampered brat, which is NOT going to help her in the long run.", "She is a teenager who at this moment highlighted her lack\nOf emotional intelligence . She will grow out of it. Not sure what the uncles major malfunction is", "NTA.  15 is more than old enough to understand that she's not going to be the center of your attention when you son is in the hospital for a MONTH!  And how dare you for MAKING her grandfather miss her birthday.  How does the world keep spinning.  This was awesome time for her parents to reinforce that not everything is about her but...oh yeah...her dad at least is just as entitled and self-centered as she is.", "NTA \n\nYour sister and BIL have some work to do with that one. Not allowing a 15 year old to antagonize you into an apology or a confrontation doesn't make you an a-holes. BIL is pretty much teaching her that her feelings and getting attention supercedes other people's priorities.", "BIL saying \u201cmaking her grandfather miss her birthday\u201d\u2026 OP didn\u2019t MAKE her dad miss the birthday. Her son, his grandson, was in the hospital. Unless she\u2019s the reason he was in the hospital, she didn\u2019t MAKE it happen. Priorities. What an AH (BIL, not OP!)", "NTA, your BIL is.", "That kid is in for a rude awakening as she enters the real world and realizes no gives gives AF about her precious feelings", "NTA.\n\n Hopefully BIL and niece will become disabled soon so they can get all of the attention too./s", "NTAH- op \u201cmade\u201d grandpa miss the birthday? No he was stepping up to help family in a time of need.. that language should make anyone tipped off to the entitlement being thrown around.", "OP, you are not the AH.  Had my BIL made the same remark to me in that position, he'd have left my home with a broken nose.  I hope all does work out with your relationship with your sister.  Best of luck to you and your son...", "NTA\n\nMy biological dad died on the day of my step sister's birthday party.  We all lived together Brady Bunch style and were only 18 months different in age.  My parents had a family friend handle her party.  She was turning 13.  I never even THOUGHT of this until now and my bio dad died in 1979.  Life happens.  There are things that are more important than a party.", "NTA. Your BIL and your niece are though.", "Wow, your BIL is an angry dude. I'd have told him that I hope he gets just as much attention when his kid is in the hospital. Before he opened his mouth I would definitely have apologized, but after he said that I would be done with him.", "NTA and my sincere sympathies that on top of these huge and difficult problems there is the petty BS drama.  Your niece was ok to say her feelings were hurt and you didn\u2019t say it here but presumably you said oh shoot sorry before \u2018it slipped my mind\u2019.  This is incredibly unfamilial behavior, good luck with it all.", "\u201cYou took over everyone\u2019s attention for a month\u201d\n\nExcuse me, WHAT? Like you were a whiny crybaby who sucked up everyone\u2019s resources because you had a cold or something?\n\nBIL is completely TA and his daughter isn\u2019t far behind. You\u2019re a single father of a disabled child who was sick enough to have an extended hospitalization. They can fuck themselves right off and I wouldn\u2019t bother acknowledging anything of your niece\u2019s in the future. They weren\u2019t understanding or nice, you need to return the favor.", "She's 15, but she's a kid and deserves the benefit of the doubt that she doesn't understand how \"my son is in the hospital\" can translate to \"expect to be forgotten by me for a while.\" The right thing to do for your niece would have been to apologize, not for your actions, but to express sympathy for her being affected by the situation, and to use it as a teachable moment on how her priorities will not always be important to the people around her no matter how much they love her. Yes, she's old enough to understand, but not old enough to be held responsible for knowing without having it explained.\n\nBut you're not her parent and it was reasonable to expect her parents would have already done this and be blindsided by her words. I think NAH between you and your niece. Your BIL though is another story. Kids need to learn that they are not the center of attention and they do not control other people's actions. He is trying to make his kid the center of the universe and use her feelings to manipulate you. Even if you were not treating her well, it's a terrible example to demand different treatment when he had the option of just removing her from the situation. There has to be more going on between him and your sister or between him and you.", "NTA, Here was a perfect time for the BIL to school his daughter about not being a spoiled brat.  And he decided to waste it. Too many people out there that think everyone should give a rip about their birthday. Birthdays\u2026.we all have one, get over yourself.", "So if the roles were reversed, would your BIL be the same way with his daughter? Yes, he would\u2019ve done the same thing. What a jerk. Sorry but he is and he\u2019s raising your niece to think the same way. Good grief. Your son was priority and that\u2019s that.", "NTA. You hurt your niece's feelings by... \\*checks notes\\* caring for your critically ill child. Yeah, that's on her. You were legitimately busy with more important things.", "Just to comment on the update, I think you made the best choice you could given the circumstances. I think your sister will understand, she sounds like the kind of person that will. From one mom to another who\u2019s has a child in a car accident, I feel some of your heartbreak, although more than likely not to your extent. I truly wish the best for you and for your son moving forward.", "Nta. Your BIL is the biggest entitled jerk and is teaching his daughter and giving the bad example of everything should be about her, as how you describe your sister I don't think you would loose your relationship with her and she would understand. But if there of your family knows about this they are going to eat your bil and niece, and honestly yhey deserve a reality check. World doesn't revolve around them, not even on birthdays, specially if theres an emergency you can't control, life happens, and they need to deal with whatever are the consequences for them. I hope the best for you and your son in the future.", "NTA. \"You stole all the attention\" is a weird way of talking about someone who was hospitalized for a month.", "They want an apology: \"I'm sorry my son's hospitalization and near death experience inconvenienced ***you***.\"", "NTA. They're the assholes for making you feel shit about prioritizing your son.", "NTA. Your son is your priority. Full stop. Your BIL needs to be a better father and explain to his kid that sometimes, nothing matters except someone's child.", "Idk I think the niece is more emotionally mature than OP and BIL", "Nobody is saying he should apologize for prioritizing the son. After his son was discharged, he could have texted her; \"Good news- (son's name) is able to leave the hospital. Happy late birthday- I'm sorry we weren't able to come.\"\nShe wasn't upset they didn't come. She was hurt that she didn't hear from them at all, not even after her birthday and after the ill son was discharged. And OP couldn't even have said \"I know, it was a shitty time for us all. I'm sorry you felt hurt.\"\nSaying sorry isn't an admission of guilt or regret. It's just saying sorry.", "Kids sometimes gotta learn their birthday isn't always gonna be a hit"]}
