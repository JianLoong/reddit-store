Obviously, the country is unstable and those have been incredibly stressful times for me. It was not safe for me to leave the house, so I was often inside with his sisters for the entire duration of the trip.\n\nPlease don't get me wrong, I love his sisters and his family, but the country is not very safe and Westerners face a very high risk of kidnapping. I learnt to speak Arabic so I could communicate with my husband's family, but at the end of the day, I look and sound German.\n\nNow his parents (M68 and F66) are getting older and his dad just had a heart attack. My husband desperately wants to go back as he is worried that he is running out of time. His dad had surgery, and my husband is very, very concerned that we might lose his dad. He wants to see him again before he passes.\n\nNow the challenge comes in the fact that I am four months pregnant with our first, and I am terrified of going and something happening to either one of us. I totally understand my husband's fear of losing his dad, as I have already lost my mom, but it feels so risky with our baby now on the way. Even if he goes by himself, I honestly don't know what I would do if he didn't come back.\n\nMy husband's mom, please forgive her as she is going through a hard time, phoned us the other day and called me selfish because I am standing in the way. She told me that her son will always listen to me, but that I am going to be the reason that my father-in-law passes away without seeing either my husband or I again. I totally understand where she is coming from, I really do, but I am terrified for my own little family and our safety.\n\nMy husband is absolutely wracked with guilt either way and I am wondering if I am being the AH.

If he can't travel back bc he is (gonna be) a dad now, how could he ever see his family again in the next 16 - 20 yrs if the country stays unstable?
