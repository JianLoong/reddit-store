Its got a lot of space in the front, with a big fruit garden in the back, but its not completely separated, its got a fence on a few sides, but the other one next to the woods is free. We also have a few house dogs (cane corso and a husky) that are really well trained, they are often in the garden because they need that space to move around, but they never pass our territory and that being said, they are protective of it. They arent agressive, they just start barking and basically never stop. \nSo, the issue is this kid from the neighborhood. We dont know where does he live, but he keeps walking his tiny beagle around here. There is no issue when he walks him through the woods, but he keeps going to our garden which is right in front of our window and i always feel uncomfortable when i see him there, and i get annoyed. But when someone goes out to tell him to move, he runs to the woods and starts saying we cant do anything since he isnt on our property. Even that wouldnt be an issue, but he keeps calling and chasing our dogs and im really scared something bad is going to happen since im not always home and my parents might not notice him since only my window sees that part. So today he kept calling them to go with him to the woods after i told him to go away, and i got annoyed and told him i have pictures and will call the police on him if he keeps doing it. And now everyone is saying i probably traumatized him and that i didn\u2019t have to be so rough, but im also only 19 so hes not much younger than me, and as a girl i feel very humiliated when a teenage boy is walking by my window almost everyday. \nSo AITA? Should i have been gentler?\n\nEdit: Id like to mention, we cant put the last fence up since our other neighboor wont allow it since he uses that space to park his car. We dont mind that since he is not bothering us, and our dogs ARE properly trained and no, no one is capable of luring them out, they just get scared and stressed. And we wont ruin our relationship with a good neighbor with a sick mother that needs that space, for an immature kid that knows no boundaries, so yeah fence IS smart and it would help but would never have been needed if that kid didnt peep through my window and harrass my dogs so i dont know, i just want him to stop coming around my property.", "created_utc": 1672664230, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101c021/aita_for_telling_a_kid_from_our_neighborhood_i/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Take pics of him on your property. Call police. Tell police you would like him trespassed from your property. They will have to make contact with this person to trespass him. Once he is trespassed by police, he will be arrested whenever he trespasses against you in the future. \n\nHe sounds like a dumb annoying kid. But for safety you should probably record the whole thing and bring a male friend with you when you do this.

This is an excellent deterrent for trespassers, as no one likes to get wet.", "NTA\u2026.

That is a 100+ lb dog. \n\nUnless he\u2019s directly on your property there\u2019s not much the police will do. I don\u2019t think you were too harsh by saying you would call them but perhaps you should send your parents outside to confront the kid. It definitely sounds like it has the potential to be a dangerous situation. No matter how \u201ctrained\u201d your dogs are, if they are barking they are giving a warning & it sounds like this kid is ignoring that. Very strange. Personally, I would walk around the neighborhood & find out where he lives. Maybe someone should speak to his parents. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n**That's your property, not his**. *And how old does he look like? Is he very young or somewhere in his teenage years?* If I was in your situation, I'd be more worried if my dogs suddenly attacked/bit that kid because he keeps on annoying them. You said your dogs aren't agressive, but still, they're animals who have instincts and they can attack someone or defend themselves anytime. Who would want to get sued just because a kid keeps on going to someone's property and annoys their dog?\n\n**REPORT IT AND FIND THE PARENTS SO THEY'LL BE THE ONE TO DISCIPLINE HIM, SINCE HE WON'T LISTEN TO YOU.**", "NTA but I definitely think you need to fence your property. What if one of your dogs decides to make a stand and protect your property? You could be liable", "NTA insurance agent here, if he gets hurt on your property your screwed so I would put up a security camera like ring and show that to the police. Also go get a no trespassing sign. That can save your ass in most US states. I totally get not being able to put up a fence.

Hopefully he'll stay off your property.", "NTA as it is private property and he has been verbally told not to be on said property. Next step if behavior continues is to alert authorities of trespass and harassment.\n\nThat being said, if I am understanding this correctly, there is a fence along the front yard and along both sides, but no fence along the back, making it kind of U shaped? My best suggestion would be temporary fencing between the sides of the house and the fences along the sides. Use the same materials as current fencing and these could be repurposed to the back once you have the go ahead to close the gap. At the very least, it would reduce the chance of contact between this kid, his dog, and your dogs. It may also help your dogs by providing a boundary around the area they consider their territory and their family. I would also suggest No Trespassing signs on all three fences facing out, and a standing No Trespassing facing the gap in the fence. A motion activated light and new camera facing the gap would also be a good idea, but would def prioritize the fencing and signs.", "\"cane corso\"  Enough said.  You will be on the hook when your dogs go after the kid.  Be realistic.", "NTA  but put the fencing up.... doesn't matter if your neighbor doesn't like it, it's a liability with having animals regardless of how well they're trained. I have a Corso, having a neighbor kid taunt that breed, crossing into their territory and bringing a dog that's small enough to be considered prey is asking for an accident and a law suit. Your setting your dog up for failure. No amount of training can remove that guardian mentality and someone WILLINGLY crossing onto your property and taunting him will cause him to react eventually. Your dog will be find at fault and sentenced to death. \n\nMark off 1ft into the property line and put up the fencing... also, mount cameras and no trespassing signs.", "Esh \n\nGet a proper fence up for your dogs.

If someone can lure your dogs out of your yard that\u2019s a problem. Good fences make good neighbors", "YTA. Yeah the kids being a jerk here but it\u2019s incredibly irresponsible to just let your dogs out in an unfenced yard. Some of my neighbors do that and I\u2019ve had their dogs charge mine more than once. And when it happens they always a. Claim it\u2019s never happened before and b. Try to blame me for the incident since their dog \u201cKnows not to leave the yard.\u201d  So given how familiar your story sounds to that I really question if the kids even doing what you say.

Next time, film yourself telling him to get off the property and start it before you ever confront him so that it shows him on the property. Start a written log showing date, time, and a note of where you caught him (by the west fence, by your bedroom window, etc). And start calling the cops with no notification to him (after filming him at least once so you can show the cops). \n\nAlso, if you have photos, ask people in your neighborhood and on social media. Feel free to tell him he's been trying to coax your dogs off the property (since I think I remember you saying that), that he's been hanging around your bedroom window and you're worried he's a peeping Tom or trying to rob the place. \n\nI'm seriously worried about this and you. He sounds malicious and you should absolutely take steps to protect yourself. If he does do something or scares your dogs enough to defend themselves/the property, those records are going to be *very* important in protecting your dogs and making sure he's held accountable.

If your dogs attack the kid because the yard isn\u2019t fenced, you will be at fault.

Also, the kid is looking to get a pretty bad bite. Corsos are estate guardians. It's a miracle he hasn't needed stitches yet. There are some neighborhood watch communities, since OP doesn't know who he is, I'd say looking into that and posting a picture asking if anyone knows who he is and explain what's been happening.

Why on earth would he try to lure out a breed that is considered extremely agressive?", "They told him not to walk his dog here multiple times, he just runs to the other area when he hears them and starts telling them not to bother him since he is no longer on our property, i once told him to go away from my window but he just ran to hide and returned later\ud83e\udd72", "My parents tried talking to him multiple times, and i am scared FOR him on top of all since i dont doubt my dogs but still they are dogs and something could put them over the edge, and the cane corso is a big scaredy cat but he was abused before we got him, i usually just pull them inside when i see him but he does get shaky after the bothering, so i think he just enjoys seeing us all panicked i dont know.", "Yes thats exactly what im scared of, they are big dogs after all and are capable of hurting him if he scares hem enough. He is a teenager for sure, around 16 so definitely not a little kid, he is 100% taller than me though so im also scared for me too lol, but i have been trying to find his parents and get pics", "Thats why we always pull them inside when we notice him, but we might be too late one time, and until we are able to put the fence itll be really stressful, like i genuinely wanted to scare him off even though thats bad because how else am i supposed to protect him and my dogs until we are able to complete the fence??", "Exactly, we are trying to get around to it but it is not instant, and i need a quick solution really. Because who knows when the dogs will get annoyed enough to do something. They are just dogs really.

They just get stressed and scared shitless.", "As i said, the fence is not complete, i didnt specify it but the opening is big enough for a car to pass to accomodate our neighbor, he enters through there, my dogs have no business going there since they are always in front of the house, he is trying to lure them from behind our house where they dont go.", "He is not, but the land was owned by two brothers before we bought it and its not on the flat area so its really weird and hard to define, so he uses that issue we have with the fence to enter our property. My dogs arent allowed in the back near the fence and they know that, but he keeps calling them there", "Why do you assume they bark all day? They bark and we get them inside and they stop. Why do you all keep assuming stuff i dont even mention? And who said other neighbors are okay with it? He just keeps returning to our place because thats what he decided to do. Its not that weird.", "I never said my dogs wont bite, i know they will if they are provocated enough, thats exactly why i am worried and trying to hurry up the fencing but we moved here fairly recently and otjer stuff is getting done too. Dogs are dogs and i know they will bite but they wont be able to if he is not coming to our garden and calling them. I am just trying to prevent that until the gate is placed.", "The well trained bit was about not leaving, not not biting so yeah you are completely right since you cant teach a dog not to be a dog", "NTA and this comment & suggestion should be higher", "I get not having enough info to go to the cops, they likely wouldn't care much anyway.

He is casing your property and assessing the risk, figuring out how to bypass the dogs.\n\nMy dad had a watchdog for his business.

I do think that you need to tell his parents. Hopefully that will stop him from doing it. He shouldn\u2019t be doing that to you and your dogs. As a girl I understand why you wouldn\u2019t want him walking by your bedroom and looking in. That is a little creepy.", "So weird & annoying. Maybe you should call the police just to ask what you can do. Especially if the kid is looking in your windows. Ugh... Creepy!! It may also be a good idea to have a report or something on record in case he does somehow lure your dogs off your property. \n\nSide note \u2014 the more you get stressed & anxious the more your dogs will be fearful of this situation. Frightened dogs are the most unpredictable dogs... if you can\u2019t stop the kid maybe try training your dogs to go inside & get a treat when the kid shows up. It may help them to be less stressed about the situation. Good luck!!", "Seems to me that he's old enough to understand that that's your property and he has no right to annoy other people and their dogs. And those people who tell you that you traumatised him for asking him to stay away are wrong! Telling someone that you'd call the police because they won't respect your property is traumatising \u2014 *ridiculous*! **I'm 100% sure he's just trying to annoy you.** He may be a minor, but at that age he should know what is right from wrong! People around you need to stop babying people like him.", "Yeah a dog can only be pushed so far before they feel threatened. Get the police involved once you have proof of him on your property.

An easy first step is putting up No Trespassing signs. Probably won't deter the kid, but it's an easy legal step.", "Get pepper spray. Next time he shows up, don't yell at him, just pepper spray him straight away. He will never, ever come back. \n\nIf he decides to go to the police, then he's just identifying himself and you can press charges against him. \n\nAlso, you can just call the police now and tell them a man keeps coming around and you've repeatedly notified him that he is trespassing and that he you believe he is pepping on you in your bedroom, and that you are afraid for your safety, BECAUSE YOU ARE! They may take it seriously, they may not, but you can get a record going so if you do pepper spray him later, you have more evidence that it was self defense.", "So he really has no business going anywhere near there.

I get why you are so upset by this.", "Totally understand that! Both your dogs a very smart breeds (cane corso is stubborn & slobbery but a wonderful breed) I bet it wouldn\u2019t take them too long to learn to retreat when they see the other dog. The annoying kid does not sound like a smart pet owner. I would be concerned too.\n\nMy dogs (3 labs) are all off-leash trained & I trained them to go sit on our deck when they see my neighbors dogs outside (our yards are wooded & there\u2019s a fence between our property so they don\u2019t see each other often). They sit & wait for treats. My dogs just want to play but the neighbors dogs are timid & not socialized that much with other dogs so I don\u2019t want them to get stressed by my pack. It\u2019s annoying as hell that this kid would intentionally upset your pack.", "The reason I suggest that is because if you have a camera and he cuts through it it is considered destruction of property. Police are more likely to get involved. Kid is for sure just being a dick but honestly I would get the police involved because fuck that kid. He needs to learn to respect other peoples space and property", "Doesn\u2019t sound like a safe space. Putting up fences would be the responsible thing to do so your dogs are safe.

Like really, im not scared that they might do something stupid, im scared he will do something that might push them over and im not there to protect all three of them, especially since i know how much of a scaredy cat my cane is, the husky is more hard headed but still stays in her spot and just barks when she notices him, so i am very lucky with them, just that kid\u2026. Is stressing me out real bad haha", "I actually didnt think of that, good point, thank you a lot!!!", "Good assumption but there is no wildlife here, and we tried to talk about the fence, but if we move it closer to us that it should be, it wont be able to connect, so we cant do it until we have enough resources which cant be anytime soon, so its not an immediate solution, and im scared that by the time we can put it up something bad might happen because he refuses to stop.", "Do you own that house or your parents? If you don\u2019t own it and they do. They should be putting  up the other fence. Not you. He is old enough to know better. Especially after telling him not to. Obviously he isn\u2019t stupid if he is running and saying he isn\u2019t on your property when you all tell him something. He knows right from from. Then for him to keep coming back after being told multiple times not to. Get a camera. He isn\u2019t a toddler.", "Wish you & your pack all the best. Hopefully, you successfully \u201cscared\u201d the kid off & he won\u2019t be back!", "They know not to get close to unfamiliar things and to call us when they notice something, but one day he might pass their boundaries and they attack him because they are puppies after all, plus they always do everything together so if he gets one\u2026 well he will get both of them and two big dogs are haaard to keep off", "There\u2019s wildlife everywhere", "I hope so too!! Thank you!!", "Its literally a settlement, a lot of houses just in the woods, the only wild life around here is miles away up in the mountains and they never come down, plus my dogs arent unsupervised when out so there are my parents to worry about too if we are talking about that. You cant compare an arrogant kid to the wildlife.", "It is up to you and your parents to keep the dogs safe. Whether the predator is a small child, other animal or adult dog napper, you need to keep them safe. If they aren\u2019t safe unsupervised then you need to supervise. Don\u2019t let them out without a leash if it\u2019s that bad. You need to be responsible pet owners. You are naive if you think you don\u2019t have wildlife too", "As i said, multiple times already, they are supervised, they dont go back, when he is noticed they are called inside, someone is always watching them, my dad is deaf and cant hear him calling them, im worried for HIS safety because he will be in danger if we dont notice quick enough once and i dont want that on my back.", "My dogs are genuinely the most important things in our lives and i wont lock them up when theyre good behaved until we have a fence for some arrogant kid with no boundaries. No one had the right to call my dogs"]}
