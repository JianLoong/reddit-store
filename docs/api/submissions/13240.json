About four months ago, we found out that I was pregnant with our first child. \n\nWe were overjoyed, and told most of our family about it early on. My husband didn't want to reveal it to our friends yet, and so I didn't. It was incredibly hard for me, especially because I couldn't tell JJ (30F). \nJJ and I have been best friends since we were 14. I love her to death, and we tell each other every single thing. But I decided to respect my husband's wishes this time. JJ also moved 3 hours away from us earlier this year, so she doesn't visit as much either. \n\nNaturally, over the past month, more and more of our friends have gotten to know about it. But I couldn't find the right time to tell JJ, and my husband didn't insist much either. \n\nYesterday, JJ visited us and I revealed the pregnancy through a small box that said \"You're an aunty now!\" with a baby onesie. Now, JJ's a little goofy. Which is what I love the most about her, she doesn't care what others think and is just a very entertaining person in general. When she saw the text, she immediately started screaming and then cried and hugged me. It was a very emotional moment for both us. \n\nMy husband seemed pretty happy about it too, although he's known to not adore JJ's amusing behavior sometimes. She's a huge jokester, and loves roasting him. After the reveal, she gave him a huge hug, then a pat on the back and said \"Damn Mike, didn't know you could do that.\" \nThis was clearly a joke, and everyone in the room let out a laugh.\n\nMy husband was not very happy. He responded with \"You know, this is why you were the last one to know about this\" in a very passive aggressive tone. JJ was taken aback and confused. She asked me if that was true, and when I responded with an explanation, she said she was kinda hurt, but was happy for us.  \n\nThe excitement died down in the room after that, and everybody left soon after. I got really mad at my husband for saying that to JJ, but he says that he is tired of her cracking jokes and not taking things seriously. And most of all, he hates that I never \"take his side.\"\n\nKnowing JJ, she's really just kidding most of the time and I don't think there's anything to be that offended over.

It doesn't matter if JJ likes roasting him; if he doesn't also like it (and he clearly doesn't), then it isn't roasting - it's bullying. And, like many who have been bullied continuously, he had finally had enough and clapped back. Was it mean? Yes. But so was her bullying.\n\nIf you don't have the awareness to see how her bullying affects your husband, that's a you problem, and you don't get to blame him when he stands up for himself.\n\nYTA, and you need to talk to JJ about her bullying your husband.

It\u2019s also exhausting to be around someone who constantly insults (that\u2019s what roasting is) them while their SO stands by and laughs at them too. Your friend is not nice and you don\u2019t seem to get that. It\u2019s the same as when a person says that they\u2019re brutally honest. They\u2019re just being an asshole, like your friend. The fact that you are okay with someone putting down your partner makes you the asshole.", "YTA Not everyone has to appreciate your friend's humor. If she finds joy in making derogatory remarks about people, that doesn't sound like a good person. I hate people who make rude, snide remarks about people for their own amusement. \n\nYour friend should not be making jokes about your husband's ability to sexually perform. It is in extremely bad taste. It isn't cute or funny. I don't know how you don't see that your friend is  rude.", "YTA. \n\nI think what your friend said was 100% uncalled for. Especially since it seems to be a habit she has that he doesn\u2019t find funny. Some people enjoy a good ribbing, but if it bothers him and you\u2019re not supporting him that\u2019s pretty shitty. It makes it worse that all this happened in front of a crowd.

When pushed, people push back. \n\nFrom here I\u2019d suggest having a conversation with JJ and just saying, \u201chey I know it\u2019s your sense of humor but Mike does not appreciate it and it hurts his feelings so if you could not make jokes at his expense I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d And if she\u2019s a good friend she should accept that.
