About four months ago, we found out that I was pregnant with our first child. \n\nWe were overjoyed, and told most of our family about it early on. My husband didn't want to reveal it to our friends yet, and so I didn't. It was incredibly hard for me, especially because I couldn't tell JJ (30F). \nJJ and I have been best friends since we were 14. I love her to death, and we tell each other every single thing. But I decided to respect my husband's wishes this time. JJ also moved 3 hours away from us earlier this year, so she doesn't visit as much either. \n\nNaturally, over the past month, more and more of our friends have gotten to know about it. But I couldn't find the right time to tell JJ, and my husband didn't insist much either. \n\nYesterday, JJ visited us and I revealed the pregnancy through a small box that said \"You're an aunty now!\" with a baby onesie. Now, JJ's a little goofy. Which is what I love the most about her, she doesn't care what others think and is just a very entertaining person in general. When she saw the text, she immediately started screaming and then cried and hugged me. It was a very emotional moment for both us. \n\nMy husband seemed pretty happy about it too, although he's known to not adore JJ's amusing behavior sometimes. She's a huge jokester, and loves roasting him. After the reveal, she gave him a huge hug, then a pat on the back and said \"Damn Mike, didn't know you could do that.\" \nThis was clearly a joke, and everyone in the room let out a laugh.\n\nMy husband was not very happy. He responded with \"You know, this is why you were the last one to know about this\" in a very passive aggressive tone. JJ was taken aback and confused. She asked me if that was true, and when I responded with an explanation, she said she was kinda hurt, but was happy for us.  \n\nThe excitement died down in the room after that, and everybody left soon after. I got really mad at my husband for saying that to JJ, but he says that he is tired of her cracking jokes and not taking things seriously. And most of all, he hates that I never \"take his side.\"\n\nKnowing JJ, she's really just kidding most of the time and I don't think there's anything to be that offended over.

And, like many who have been bullied continuously, he had finally had enough and clapped back. Was it mean? Yes. But so was her bullying.\n\nIf you don't have the awareness to see how her bullying affects your husband, that's a you problem, and you don't get to blame him when he stands up for himself.\n\nYTA, and you need to talk to JJ about her bullying your husband.

And his wife laughs at the jokes too, which probably makes it worse.

It\u2019s also exhausting to be around someone who constantly insults (that\u2019s what roasting is) them while their SO stands by and laughs at them too. Your friend is not nice and you don\u2019t seem to get that. It\u2019s the same as when a person says that they\u2019re brutally honest. They\u2019re just being an asshole, like your friend. The fact that you are okay with someone putting down your partner makes you the asshole.", "YTA Not everyone has to appreciate your friend's humor. If she finds joy in making derogatory remarks about people, that doesn't sound like a good person. I hate people who make rude, snide remarks about people for their own amusement. \n\nYour friend should not be making jokes about your husband's ability to sexually perform. It is in extremely bad taste. It isn't cute or funny. I don't know how you don't see that your friend is  rude.", "YTA. \n\nI think what your friend said was 100% uncalled for. Especially since it seems to be a habit she has that he doesn\u2019t find funny. Some people enjoy a good ribbing, but if it bothers him and you\u2019re not supporting him that\u2019s pretty shitty. It makes it worse that all this happened in front of a crowd.

When pushed, people push back. \n\nFrom here I\u2019d suggest having a conversation with JJ and just saying, \u201chey I know it\u2019s your sense of humor but Mike does not appreciate it and it hurts his feelings so if you could not make jokes at his expense I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d And if she\u2019s a good friend she should accept that.

Sometimes we simply agree to disagree. \n(I apologise for any mistakes, English is not my first language)", "Still a joke get some humor", "I'm not standing up for my husband who's got a mouth in a silly situation like this, this isn't a situation that requires his to defend his honor.  Who could've said something years ago. I didn't say JJ wasn't wrong. Cuz she was. She could've made a different joke or not one at all. But I hate to say it, ops husband is beyond sensitive if something this requires his wife to stand up for him and that the way he has to defend himself hurts his wife. He could've said anything to JJ that didn't put his wife in a situation also. Homeboy needs a pair and I c why JJ was surprised op is pregnant. Cuz frankly so am I. ETA: words to finish a sentence.", "Naw. He should've stood up awhile ago. It's silly to me when ppl do that im gunna tell you in private stuff. There is no reason this situation shouldve happened. If they've been friends for so long and he's had an issue with her actions and jokes for that long, he should've nipped it in the bud years ago. He shouldn't have needed defending from this cuz he can speak. And I hate to tell you but that you tell her/him stuff don't work and it don't help. Not for kids, not for husbands or wives. If you dont stand up for yourself the first time, it's gunna make them(JJ or whomever) take you as a joke. You should b defending those who tried and failed. He didn't even try. Don't even got enough sense to recognize the issue is with JJ and he shouldn't b arguing with his wife.", "Not trying to argue, just giving more context. I do understand everyone's judgement here and I'm trying to find the right way to fix the situation with all the input I'm getting here. Sorry if it came off as arguing.", "But clearly he is capable of impregnating his wife. So why would he be insulted by the insinuation that he can't. The proof is there. Unless he thinks his wife cheated on him? I don't understand people. Especially not men with fragile masculinity.", "If someone needs advance notice of my life changes to avoid insulting my spouse, they will not be my friend.", "What makes you think this?? She specifically said life got busy and she hadn\u2019t found the right time to tell her even after her husband was okay with it and took an extra month to do it. Op wasn\u2019t forced to hide things from her specifically for a long time, her friends were all finding out over the month but she states that JJ had moved away and she hadn\u2019t found the right time because they don\u2019t visit frequently. OP could have texted her at any given point considering most of her other friends had found out by then, but she chose to wait to be in person because she literally prepared an announcement box for \u201cauntie.\u201d \n\nThere is absolutely zero reason to blame the husband for this? OP is the one that wanted to do the box and in person thing and it\u2019s not like her husband was targeting JJ, plenty of their friends knew first solely because they lived closer.", "I think the mood was killed by the expression of incredulity that OP's spouse could impregnate her, not the spouse's reaction to it.", "Just by reading this I can tell you're too dumb to get pregnant.\n\nCourse I'm just joking aren't I.", "Your archaic views represent everything that is wrong with feminism. Men are allowed to be sensitive. Doesn\u2019t make them any less of a man.", "No worries. I guess the best comparison I have is all the AITA posts about pranksters. Inevitably the pranksters try to defend themselves by saying to the victim, \u201cit\u2019s just a prank!\u201d \u201cLighten up, you\u2019re too upright!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just who (prankster) is!\u201dEssentially blaming the victim of the prank for not forgiving them and taking it. But when we read these, the prankster is almost always in the wrong. AITA responses are almost unanimous on that. \n\nObviously JJ isn\u2019t that extreme but it\u2019s the same idea. Her jokes are hurtful to your husband, and both you and her are expecting him to just put up with it because \u201cit\u2019s just a joke!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just who JJ is!\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s too uptight!\u201d If he doesn\u2019t like the jokes, your husband shouldn\u2019t have to put up them, plain and simple. It sounds like no one\u2019s told JJ this, so you\u2019ve got to. Maybe show her this post or explain the prank analogy. \n\nIt\u2019s also about knowing who you can make those jokes around. Know your audience. Obviously a lot of people like her humor and don\u2019t mind being the butt of her Jokes. But if she\u2019s aware someone doesn\u2019t like it, she should take care not to do it to them. (For example, I make a lot of inappropriate would-get-me-canceled-if-I-had-a-following jokes. But ONLY to my sister, who rolls her eyes since she knows I don\u2019t mean a word of it. I would NEVER say such things to anyone else)", "You start by apologizing to your husband for not having his back.\n\n_Clearly_ he doesn't like your friend's jokes at his expense, and has expressed that to you before.\n\nYou can either choose acknowledge this as valid (which it is), or else he will inevitably start to have contempt for you, too.\n\nGrow the fuck up, you're about to be a parent.  That means it's time to be an adult, too.", "You fix the situation by apologizing to your husband and having a serious conversation with your friend. It's really easy actually. Instead of laughing at him defend him. She owes him an apology too.", "Question, if she starts pulling this shit on your kid and then says they don't like it, what are you gonna do then?", "Best way to fix things is to apologise to your husband and tell your friend to back off with the continued roasting of him. You need to start supporting him in social situations more. Husband\u2019s comfort trumps friend\u2019s.", "If it\u2019s not an insult, you shouldn\u2019t have much trouble explaining why it\u2019s humorous.", "Again, this may be a cultural thing but in the US where I think OP might be), it's considered impolite to tell a man that you're skeptical about his masculinity. Even men who aren't fragile in their masculinity might take offense to this because it's a rude thing to say.\n\nIf you're not on close terms with someone, insulting jokes can still be upsetting. Not because you secretly agree with them, but because it's rude and people choosing to be rude to you can be hurtful to some people, especially if your spouse doesn't care.", "Lol. I'm not offended easily. And have bigger balls they ops husband. Joke all you want. The kids I have prove that joke wrong. But I can tell you're one of those sensitive crusaders who expects everything to wrapped in bubble wrap. Wrong is wrong. And all of them were. For different reasons. JJ shouldn't have said what she said, ops husband should've have taken a shot at JJ that hit his wife on the way, and op is silly for thinking that she shouldn't have told the both of them to grow up and leave her out of it and that she's also not guilty for deferring to her husband about when she disclosed something about her body to anyone she chose. She insists they're so close but she decided to just hush up and say nothing-to her husband and JJ. If she felt that it was important she could've discussed it with her husband about telling JJ. She needs to stand on it and not make excuses. There is no reason that all of these supposed adults are acting like this. There is no reason that JJ and ops husband couldn't figure out how to interact for ops sake and that op couldn't have taken the reins and made them figure it out for the sake of those 2 relationships. JJ is clearly rude and ops husband is soft.", "What does this have to do with feminism?", "Naw. Men are allowed to b sensitive everyday of the week. Men shouldn't b sensitive and hurt their wives and then stomp their feet. That's my issue. He said what he said to JJ tryin to hurt JJ but also hurt his wife, which clearly didn't occur to him and then had the gall to say you should've stood up for me. That's not sensitivity, that's entitlement. Regardless of what someone says or does, he shouldn't have responded in a way that negatively affected or impacted his wife. That's why he's soft in my mind. Men can b defended by their wives but this situation he deserves to sink on his own.", "\"wrong is wrong except when it's directed at a guy who I think isn't manly enough\" gotcha", "Yea I'm sure your kids think you're great\ud83d\ude44. They probably fear what will happen if they don't. I'm also not offended easily but I'll be damned if some outsider comes in and disrespects mine.", "I would much rather surround myself with \u201csoft\u201d people like OPs husband than people who take pride in being cold and uncaring.", "Personally I\u2019m doing the whole if genders were reversed angle here. There are double standards when it comes to \u201cjokes\u201d about fertility. If a man reacts badly, he is soft or too sensitive. If a woman reacts badly she is beyond justified. Feminism promotes these ideals. Or I should say, some brands of feminism I\u2019ve come across these days. It would just be nice if everyone was subject to the same standards. Most feminists understand this, but the radical ones do not.", "But imagine if genders were reversed and the comment had been along the lines of... I assumed you were infertile or haven\u2019t your eggs all dried up. There would be understandable outrage. He shouldn\u2019t just have to suck up these comments because he is a man. The wife and her friend were massively in the wrong here. They are both bullies.", "Lol. Naw. Wrong is wrong, whether the man is soft or not. But you're so busy tryin to focus on the fact that I pointed out his wrongs after hers that you refuse to see that. There are so many options that didn't splatter is wife. He is soft in my mind for a simple reason. How do you look at someone and say defend me after you said or did something to someone else that blew back on your wife. That's why he's wrong. Becuz instead of him knocked JJ down a peg or two he knocked JJ down 4 and his wife 2. You cannot expect your wife to treat you a certain way when you won't do the same. If he had called JJ out in a way that didn't put his pregnant wife in the crossfire and then said I don't like it when you don't stand up for me or tell her to stop, it wouldn't b wrong.", "Feminism promotes nothing of the sort. Nothing about feminism suggests that men should not be able to have emotions about jokes like these or that they're not justified in asking them to stop.", "As I said about 50 times I feel like, JJ was wrong. Should've never brought his manhood into it. This isn't about sex or gender. This is about a spouse negatively impacting their spouse and expecting them to defend them after the fact. Ops husband shouldn't have brought his wives relationship with JJ into it and created problems for the pregnant lady. And op should've been told the both of them to act like adults.  I can find her wrong, him wrong, and op wrong. I amazingly can manage to have multiple thoughts."]}
