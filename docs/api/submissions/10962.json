Apparently he was usure about this. Then why not try it for 2 consecutive weekends first?\n\nAlso OP and the wife are a bit T A because 12 hours babysitting a week is a whole damn lot and to expect that for free - even from grandparents - was a stupid idea in the first place. \n\nStill nothing of that would've happened if the grandparents admitted upfront that it's too much.

Other than her kids, mine was the only one she watched so far. I paid her extra on top of what she charged every day. Then about a month in, she posted on her Facebook that her daycare would be closing indefinitely in about a week. She never bothered to say anything to me about it. So I had to rush to find another babysitter. \n\nNext lady I talked to said she never cancelled unless she was sick, and she never got sick. We much preferred the quality of this one, in that she actually taught him stuff, played games, stuff like that. He liked going there. But she cancelled a few days in because she had court. Then the next day for the same reason. He went for a day or two then she canceled a couple days for being sick. Two weeks in, she messaged me while I was at work, and told me I needed to come pick him up ASAP, that she was closing her daycare.", "Oh, I agree with you. But this is happening to folks paying $25-35/hr. In our area, it seems to be a resource issue - waaaay to many jobs, not enough babysitters. If someone is set up to pay $25/hr, but another person says they need you and they\u2019ll pay $30 instead, people jump. Hence the complaints, hence the issue.", "As a SAHM to an almost 10 month old, ya. Work would absolutely be a break. He's exhausting.", "It was honestly such an insanely huge ask to begin with, like EVERY WEEKEND?", "OP and his wife just don't want to pay.", "It\u2019s not true for everywhere though.", "I think OP and the wife were not smart in thinking that the grandparents would be okay with taking care of two young kids EVERY WEEKEND even when they, themselves, work full-time jobs all week. Did OP and wife REALLY think that was a sustainable plan? \n\nOP is NTA for \"siding\" with his parents but is TA for poor planning.", "Assuming she is talented enough to garner such prices. Just because someone started doing something out of their home, doesn\u2019t mean they do it very well", "The most I've seen nails cost is $50, and that took close to 40 mins of work.", "Crazy that we live in a world where someone's nails are worth more to them than their kids", "She had childcare when she booked these appointments. Her childcare backed out.", "He wasn't working when she started her business.", "The husband wasn't the breadwinner - she started working when he was laid off. If anyone made a poor decision about working hours, the dad did.", "So pay 30.", "i know. What im saying is her husband should give her an actual break", "I'm gonna assume someone fully booked up to end of April + someone who could keep the household afloat while husband was not working is probably doing it well.. The starting prices for nails are already pretty high atm regardless of skill.", "I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s what that price difference means\u2026. I see how you drew the conclusion but it\u2019s still a pretty weird conclusion to draw. Most nail techs use higher quality stuff than you or I are buying off Amazon and usually have gadgets the average person does like a UV thing or one of those machines that grinds your nail and stuff. I know the Amazon ones are cheap but also they\u2019re crappy I say this from experience. \n\nBabysitters, as a former child carer, are not providing equipment usually and the skills involved don\u2019t take nearly as long to learn imo. Maybe that\u2019s just me because I did professional childcare and find nails hard, but I definitely understand why nail techs can charge more than babysitters. \n\n\nI DEFINITELY agree that babysitters are undervalued in society, but the conclusion you drew is not the best way to communicate that thought.", "volunteer free childcare tends to not be reliable", "I'm fully aware of that lol. Where did I say they did?", "So when someone else has the situation why would you che in it's different for you? Everyone is different", "I think its awful to expect that from the grandparents.  They get no weekend after working all their lives? I wish I could understand why its expected in today's world.  Grandparents should never be babysitters. They can pick and choose when they want time with grandchildren.", "Depends on the area I would say. And getting booked up on weekends for 6hrs at a time again doesn\u2019t necessarily mean talent or skill. If it takes her an hour to do nails it\u2019s not the business opportunity it could be in other places. She could be busy because she\u2019s cheaper than other places", "I have never had MY PARENTS do that to me. Or heck, even other family members. It isn\u2019t like it\u2019s some random guy off the street.", "What?", "Cool. My parents did. Even after my gran provided free childcare my whole childhood. Grandparents want their own lives now, take a trip over the parenting sub and youll see.", "What help was your comment?", "It\u2019s fine to not want to be the childcare. It is not fine to insist on it, and then back out last second. They should be keeping the kids for the times she already has appointments. They agreed to it, and she made plans based on their offer. Past that, if they don\u2019t want to babysit, that\u2019s their business.", "Maybe they didn't think to check fb group pages? Maybe they don't know that rural areas have options other than using your neighbor's kid? \n\nWhat help was yours?"]}
