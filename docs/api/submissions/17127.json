I do still have bad days, months where I start to lose control and I take all the booze out of the house until trigger/ situation is stabilized or until I feel I can handle it (after some real self heart to hearts). Alcohol is a cultural thing for me/ my family so it'll never really be gone from my life, but you can get better.  She has to WANT TO GET BETTER.  No amount of AA or anti-buse (sp?) Will make her stop.  She needs to grow up and realize this isn't okay.

They should be keeping watch of her and looking after her when she gets into a bit of a state, not continuing to feed her drink until she is so incapacitated she cannot even make it to the bathroom to vomit.\n\nAnd all of this is not only bad for your girlfriend, but abusive towards you - the one left dealing with the consequences during the night.\n\nHonestly, people will always drink, they will always drink to some level of excess, and a night spent with their head in the toilet is going to happen more than once for most people. The point it is happening with some regulatory, the point it is putting their own health at risk, and the point it is causing problems for those around them is the point it is an issue, and needs to curtailed. \n\nWhether that means her gaining the confidence to say no, avoiding events like this, or ditching the asshole friend group is up to her, but she s definitely needs to do something - I wouldn't be sticking around a relationship for long if it meant dealing with this multiple times a month.", "Your gf has a problem with alcohol and you need to decide if you now want it to be your problem.
