I, assistant manager (ASM), put in for a family vacation that my parents had booked for all of our family for a trip for Christmas. My general manager (GM) raised a stink about it because GM had supposedly put in for some time similarly years ago and it was denied. \n\nGM proceeded to tell me to get ahold of corporate as the time fell during \"blackout periods\" and that GM could not approve it without their approval. I called our district manager (DM) who was an interm DM for us at the time. DM approved it as it was a family trip and not me taking time to just take time and it was a special occasion. DM said that theyd call the GM and let GM know to approve the time. Fast forward 15 minutes, I receive a call fromt the DM saying that DM cannot approve the full time and can only approve a week because DM was not aware the the GM had tried something similarly in the past and was denied. Meanwhile, I had called my parents to go ahead and book the plane tickets as they were waiting on the checkout page for an answer and I called and let them know it was ok'd to do so. I told the DM that it was booked and that it was already approved so I was planning on going and I was not going to put the company ahead of the time I was going to be spending with my family. DM said they'd have to figure it out and will let me know. I put it in our planner at work and documented that I was not going to be there. \n\nFast forward another 3-4 months. GM and I had a disagreement and had to get corporate involved because of said arguments, but that is another story. So we were on bad terms. In all of this, I had spoken to our new DM about said vacation time and DM said that they were aware of the situation. I reinforced the I was not going to put the company over my family and I would be out. DM said ok, we will cross this bridge when it came time to do so. I had to figure out where to use all my PTO I had banked and had set aside a full week to use in the New Year for the rest of vacation. I was told by GM that I'd have to call corporate to find out if it rolls over to the New Year. I found out it does not, so I put in the week that I was going to be out at unpaid time off. Our new DM, no longer the interm and a different person, apparently denied it with no call or explanation why. I did not see that until last week when GM started to make the schedule for the New Year. I reminded GM that I was going to be out, and that I will not be back until such and such date.\n\nWell, turns out another associate has something going on the weekend that I fly back and had told GM and was approved over a month ago to take off. Now, GM has made plans to go out of town after GM knew that I and another associate will be be out and that leaves only one associate to run the store. GM has only had these plans for like 2 weeks. GM is in a stink because I won't be there and they may have to leave the store short staffed/miss out on the weekend.

Clearly your company was never intending on approving your full holiday period and were going to try and force you to work it anyway.

As long as you are fine with being terminated enjoy you\u2019re trip\n\nHell, you might even be able to get unemployment when you return to hold you over when you return\n\nMight be worth reaching out to recruiters, let them know you may very well be looking for a new job come the new year. Make sure to let them know what date you will be home. Personally I always give myself an extra day off when I return. Gives me a chance to unpack, decompress and figure shit out. Might as well have someone scouting out a new job for you while on vacation. And if you don\u2019t get fired but the recruiter finds you a job?

You followed standard protocol by giving a lot of advanced notice and you were approved thats that plus they wont carry over your pto so you will lose it.
