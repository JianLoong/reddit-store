He is a mutual friend with all your friends. If he\u2019s only moving in for selfish reasons, def decline him. It is sad he ignored you while posting to strangers on social media while his friend is suffering and his family is trapped in a war torn area. \n\nI hope you and your family get to a better place. I\u2019m sorry this is happening. Being abandoned by a friend in such a rough time is seriously a low point.", "ETA Don\u2019t you think that he may have been handling the civil war differently to you hence not responding. Everyone responds to this sort of thing differently. You reached out he may have been trying to get his family through it and was unable to respond to you. Or simply didn\u2019t have the same number anymore. \n\nI remember when my compound and school was bombed in Riyadh ( Yes I grew up during the bombs and have been had my car bombed twice, compound bombed 3 times and was at the British school when that was bombed. Saudi has been on the brink of civil war for the last 30 years. It was a matter of time. I also remember when Arabs cheered and were shooting guns in victory over 9/11. That was a very strange night in Riyadh as petrol bombs were being thrown over compound walls for days continuously for a week after that. ). Some people went to ground. I was like you checking on everyone. I didn\u2019t take it personally if they didn\u2019t respond we all deal differently.", "You have no coping skills and people like you are exhausting.", "Wait. So your 'friend' was stuck in a war zone, and the college where he was is destroyed. And you were out of the country on a vacation to luxurious Saudi for 6 months? Did I get that right? And you want sympathy from him? Did you complain about your situation to him? If so, learn to read a room, and YTA.", "NTA he ghosted you in a time when you needed support and since per comments he's only speaking to people who are doing him favours, this guy isn't your friend and I wouldn't want him as a roommate either.", "To make it clear every time there is a university holiday, me and the rest of the boys always hang out and text each other\n\nHowever he\u2019s always known as the one who during holidays and when he is far away he never texts  and always ignores\nTo the point it\u2019s become a joke\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t wait till the holiday so M can ignore all my texts and calls! Haha\u201d\n\n This time it\u2019s different though. A war has literally happened and me being one of his closest friend I expected some support from him given that my parents could die at any moment. \nAnd not only does he know all this and refuses to reach out, he also ignores all my efforts to contact him!\n\nWhile I know he\u2019s active on social media cuz he is always texting the guys I live with and his gf who also studies with us here etc!", "I truly don\u2019t know why he\u2019s been completely ignoring me and honestly I feel like he just doesn\u2019t care", "OP was not trapped in a war-torn area. He was on vacation in Saudi.", "The thing is he has been contacting and talking to our mutual friends.\n\nInterestingly, he\u2019s only talking to the ones he can get smth out of (for example he as been in contact with one of our mutual friends who\u2019s trying to convince us to let him stay in our apartment, and another mutual friend who helped him out with the transferring credits so he can be accepted in uni)", "No\n\nHe at the time was in Saudi Arabia (his parents live there)\n\nSorry for the confusion.", "He may not. If you think he is merely using you, def stand your ground.", "I didn\u2019t mention he was trapped. I\u2019m wishing his parents can eventually get to a safe place so they can reunite.", "This hurts me so much tbh.", "You literally posted: \u201c\u2026while posting to strangers on social media while his friend is trapped in a war torn area.\u201d\n\nSo yes, you did mention it.", "It\u2019s fixed.
