She was always a \u201cnormal\u201d child, in the sense that her only communication issues were caused by her social anxiety, she had normal interests, & she didn\u2019t have meltdowns.\n\nHowever, her best friend, Ts, recently got diagnosed with autism & I wish she didn\u2019t. After Ts\u2019 diagnosis, Hj looked into autism & came to the conclusion that she has it, too. Hj is easily influenced by this kid, I could tell ever since she decided she was trans. She was always so feminine until Ts came out as non binary, then she turned on all things cutesy and told me she was a boy. I\u2019m an ally and was very supportive of her being bi, but this has gone too far. She\u2019s lying to herself about who she is, she\u2019s becoming a clone of Ts. \n\nI found out when I was looking through her browser history and found her looking up a LOT of things about autism, she was being weirdly obsessive about this whole idea of being autistic. When I confronted her about it, she told me about her \u201cspecial interests\u201d, which were all interests I remember her having but didn\u2019t obsess over. I\u2019ve seen special interests, my ex-husband had ADHD & he was OBSESSED with Dragon Ball, it was his only personality trait. \n\nShe binges shows & gets into the online fandoms, but she has other interests & only has a healthy obsession with them. Most of her \u201cspecial interests\u201d aren\u2019t even things autistic people fixate on, it\u2019s just normal things like shows & science. She also claimed to have sensory issues, but I\u2019ve never seen her have a meltdown. She claims she had meltdowns but I find it suspicious that I can\u2019t recall a single one, seeing as I\u2019ve always been very attentive of my daughter. \n\nShe said she stims, which I\u2019ve never seen her do. She told me about things that I\u2019m pretty sure are not stims, like singing and blinking repetitively. This seems like a huge stretch to me.\n\nShe got upset whenever I\u2019d say she doesn\u2019t have autism & said she wanted a diagnosis, to which I said absolutely not. We\u2019re not going to waste our time just to find out she\u2019s not autistic. If she does get diagnosed, she\u2019s going to regret it. She\u2019ll get picked on at school worse than she already does. \n\nShe cried & ran to her room when I told her this. Ever since, she\u2019s been acting more autistic, probably trying to convince me that she needs a diagnosis. It\u2019s downright embarrassing, her faking meltdowns in public. She\u2019s too devoted to this fantasy of her having autism like Ts. \n\nOne night during dinner she brought up her sensory issues & I got annoyed, she never complained about this stuff until Ts got diagnosed. I told her I wouldn\u2019t have introduced her to Ts if I had known she was going to be such a bad influence. She got really upset & called me ableist, which I assured her I\u2019m not, then left her dinner behind & hid in her room.\n\nI just wish my daughter would feel comfortable in her own skin, I don\u2019t want a diagnosis to confirm her fantasies she\u2019ll regret later on.

If you're right, then the doctor will confirm it. If you're wrong, tough luck. \n\nSecondly, you don't sound like you know much about how special interests or hyperfixations (the more accepted term for if the person in question has ADHD instead of being autistic, afaik) work. It can be \"normal\" things. You say your child has \"healthy obsessions\", but have you considered that some people keep things to themselves to try and avoid annoying people? Again, get that second opinion.\n\nLastly, I can't imagine how you wrote out that your child came out to you as trans and that you're a supportive ally and all, but that it's \"gone too far\" and really thought comments would agree with you. Sounds like your son is figuring out who he is, and you dictating and keeping him from getting doctor's opinions about potential medical diagnoses sucks.\n\nYTA.", "I assume that your ex-husband is her father. ADHD is often hereditary; and about 1/5 of its sufferers also have ASD. So there\u2019s a good chance that your daughter has at least ADHD. \n\nIf nothing else, I think she should see a therapist and take it from there.  This is beyond Reddit.", "YTA YTA YTA YTA\n\n\\-Misgendering your SON. \n\n\\-Ignoring your SON's cry for help.\n\n\\-Denying your SON healthcare. \n\n\\-Being ableist about your SON's possible condition. \n\nYour SON is going to leave you the second HE turns 18, which tbh, with how much you seem to hate HIM may make you happy. \n\n\"I'm an ally\" bullshit. Take that tag off yourself and call yourself what you really are, a bigoted ableist. If you're going to act that way, wipe off the fa\u00e7ade.

If your kid is autistic, you need the resources to help take of it and you are actively denying that help. If they are not autistic then you have a tool to dismiss it. You literally cannot lose if you get them tested.\n\nFYI, obsession is a sign of autism. Do your job as a parent.\n\nSide note: Class A act of not respecting your trans child wish.", "YTA. It's incredibly difficult and expensive for adults to get tested for autism. Everything revolves around testing and catering to children. You're not a professional. It's horrific to rob her of an official diagnosis based on who you want her to be and your stereotypes about autistic people. Especially without an understanding of how autism operates in girls and women\n\nGet her tested and do your research. Going undiagnosed as a girl can lead to serious longterm consequences for her. Not the least of which involves her being victimized more often. If she doesn't have it, that's fine but if she does she's *suffering* regardless of whether or not you can see it. Pretending like she's not going to get teased in school if she doesn't have a diagnosis is also absurd. Autistic kids struggle to socialize. That causes bullying regardless of what doctor you take them to", "YTA YTA YTA omg\n\nFirst of all, being trans isn't contagious. Your son opened up to you about his gender and you refuse to take him seriously? YTA\n\nSecond of all, a lot of people with autism mask it very well. Only your child knows what his own subjective experience is and if he relates to descriptions of autism, it's worth testing him to find out. It's really valuable to have a diagnosis as it can help someone get therapies and accommodations. \n\nIf you really think he doesn't have autism, why are you so against sending him to be evaluated to put this issue to rest?\n\nYou're a huge AH for dismisding your own child's experience and not listening to him when he tells you who he is. He gets to define his reality, not you. It is so arrogant and gaslighty to tell someone that they are wrong about their own identity and you know best. There is no way you could know who they are better than they do.\n\nIf you want your child to go non-contact with you as soon as he turns 18, you're right on track. Congrats.", "get her tested and when she doesn\u2019t have autism it can be laid to rest.", "YTA if your child goes to an expert and is diagnosed with autism, it's not \"fulfilling fantasies\", it's getting a diagnosis from a professional. There's an equal chance they could say \"you know, I don't think you're autistic\" and it would be a learning experience. Also you're a huge A for not respecting your child's identity, you seem to dismiss everything about Hj in this post.

Just because he's not having meltdowns or whatever, doesn't necessarily mean he isn't autistic.\n\nAlso, with a test, he can have the necessary modifications made, funding made available. Intervention is necessary and the earlier the better.\n\nYTA for completely dismissing it and thinking it's some fantasy.", "NTA imo.\n\nAs a parent to two autistic kids there would have been a lot of signs as she grew up.

Even if you didn\u2019t many teachers in schools are on the lookout for this sort of thing also.\n\nHowever you may be best off humouring  her if it doesn\u2019t put you out much financially. Once an expert rules one way or another it puts it to bed hopefully.\n\nIt\u2019s not wise to send signals to her that if she comes to you seeking support for something she thinks is wrong that she won\u2019t be believed.

I just existed in discomfort because I thought everyone did. \n\nThe moment I learned that NOT everyone feels that way I completely changed. I stopped putting up with it. I'm not going to torture myself anymore. \n\nAnd my meltdowns don't look like meltdowns either. Mine are shutdowns. I go silent and withdraw entirely. I hide until i can escape.

I never had meltdowns, I don't stim. My mother still denies I might be autistic and even said the same stuff you said about your child about her grandchild (My sister's eldest) who they constantly say is a carbon copy of me except AFAB not AMAB.", "Let's put away the idea that you need to figure out if she is autistic. Your child is telling you they think something is fundamentally wrong with them. Even if it's attention seeking or easily influenced, why does she seek it? What's going on that she wants professional help? \n\nSome of this could just be normal teenage behavior like lying or lack of empathy. But when it's consistent then we need to focus on the why not the what. See past the parental need to prove that you're right and things are ok. (This is typical coping mechanisms when we respond to our kid's stress). Look into your child to find out what they need to feel stabilized.\n\nIf she's not autistic, the medical professionals that spent 8+ years in school will tell you. But even if your kid is wrong, there will be a bigger issue if she feels ignored or not heard.", "YTA. You can't know whether your kid is autistic or not, because you won't do the assessment. Get the assessment. If your child is autistic, they deserve to know that. (And if your child is trans, or isn't trans and is just experimenting with a different gender presentation, they deserve space to figure that out, without you being invested in them being a certain gender.)", "YTA, good gawd. Let me count the ways:\n1. It\u2019s neurotypical and neurodivergent, not \u201cnormal\u201d in quotes. \n2.

I think that's more harmful then getting a professional autism test done.\n\nI totally get kids are impressionable. My own stepdaughter self-diagnoses herself and has changed her self-identity numerous times and it can be scary and even frustrating for us as adults. The thing is, it's all been pretty harmless. What is harmful is how we react. We chose to show her we *do* believe her and are allowing her to explore herself. Her doctor and therapist help provide professional input and facts to dissuade any unrealistic concerns of hers. We just keep telling her we love her, whoever she ends up being and with whatever medical diagnosis.", "YTA.\n\nIs it possible he's pretending because he wants to be like his friend? Possibly. Is is also possible he's genuinely realising things about himself that he's been taught to hide and didn't have words to explain? Also yes.\n\nAllowing him to explore these things isn't going to do him any harm if he changes his mind later. Not allowing him to explore these things is likely to do serious damage, cause him to struggle, and damage your relationship. \n\nAnd can have further effects beyond even that. You're basically teaching him, right now, that you won't listen to him or take him seriously about important things. Think of all the important things that might happen to him and his friends as he grows up, things you really, really would want him to come to you with, and ask yourself why he'd trust you with them after this.", "YTA you are being transphobic. Let\u2019s for a moment play into your transphobic assumptions and say that your son is faking being trans. He is 13, if you go along with it and treat him the same as normal then if it\u2019s not real he will grow out of it. If you fight it and tell him no you aren\u2019t then it will just reinforce it.\n\nAnd yes you are also the AH for not letting him get tested for autism, you are not a doctor and they will be able to tell whether or not it is autism. Perhaps they say yes, in which case you both need to know that information. Perhaps they say no, but he does have some other condition which is also useful information.

She was always a \u201cnormal\u201d child, in the sense that her only communication issues were caused by her social anxiety, she had normal interests, & she didn\u2019t have meltdowns.\n\nHowever, her best friend, Ts, recently got diagnosed with autism & I wish she didn\u2019t. After Ts\u2019 diagnosis, Hj looked into autism & came to the conclusion that she has it, too. Hj is easily influenced by this kid, I could tell ever since she decided she was trans. She was always so feminine until Ts came out as non binary, then she turned on all things cutesy and told me she was a boy. I\u2019m an ally and was very supportive of her being bi, but this has gone too far. She\u2019s lying to herself about who she is, she\u2019s becoming a clone of Ts. \n\nI found out when I was looking through her browser history and found her looking up a LOT of things about autism, she was being weirdly obsessive about this whole idea of being autistic. When I confronted her about it, she told me about her \u201cspecial interests\u201d, which were all interests I remember her having but didn\u2019t obsess over. I\u2019ve seen special interests, my ex-husband had ADHD & he was OBSESSED with Dragon Ball, it was his only personality trait. \n\nShe binges shows & gets into the online fandoms, but she has other interests & only has a healthy obsession with them. Most of her \u201cspecial interests\u201d aren\u2019t even things autistic people fixate on, it\u2019s just normal things like shows & science. She also claimed to have sensory issues, but I\u2019ve never seen her have a meltdown. She claims she had meltdowns but I find it suspicious that I can\u2019t recall a single one, seeing as I\u2019ve always been very attentive of my daughter. \n\nShe said she stims, which I\u2019ve never seen her do. She told me about things that I\u2019m pretty sure are not stims, like singing and blinking repetitively. This seems like a huge stretch to me.\n\nShe got upset whenever I\u2019d say she doesn\u2019t have autism & said she wanted a diagnosis, to which I said absolutely not. We\u2019re not going to waste our time just to find out she\u2019s not autistic. If she does get diagnosed, she\u2019s going to regret it. She\u2019ll get picked on at school worse than she already does. \n\nShe cried & ran to her room when I told her this. Ever since, she\u2019s been acting more autistic, probably trying to convince me that she needs a diagnosis. It\u2019s downright embarrassing, her faking meltdowns in public. She\u2019s too devoted to this fantasy of her having autism like Ts. \n\nOne night during dinner she brought up her sensory issues & I got annoyed, she never complained about this stuff until Ts got diagnosed. I told her I wouldn\u2019t have introduced her to Ts if I had known she was going to be such a bad influence. She got really upset & called me ableist, which I assured her I\u2019m not, then left her dinner behind & hid in her room.\n\nI just wish my daughter would feel comfortable in her own skin, I don\u2019t want a diagnosis to confirm her fantasies she\u2019ll regret later on. But seeing how upset she is I wonder, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also speak to your child's teachers one on one and see what they have noticed.\n\nAlso your child wont get a diagnosis if you brief the assessors about the research and personality copying - they will look at it all together and make their assessment.  The assessment for autism is not an easy or quick thing. They'd also take into consideration school reports and see if this just cropped up after the date the friend was diagnosed or if your kid has been genuinely struggling for years.\n\nMaybe speak to the friends mother about their kids diagnosis and what led them to get an assessment and then you can compare or atleast be better informed about the diagnosis process and your involvement in it and if there were signs you missed.", "NTA.

First off, I doubt he has autism, but he definitely has a disorder or extremely disordered thoughts that needs to be addressed ASAP. No kid should be putting that much effort into convincing themself they have a debilitating life long disorder. It reminds me of when I was younger and I wanted to get really sick or break an arm. I wanted to do that because I was being emotionally neglected and constantly dealing with my emotions never being considered and if I physically was hurt, people around me would have to be forced to care for me. This, along with a plethora of other shit, led me to being suicidal at age 14. This pattern of thinking was one of the first manifestations of it. Take him to see some doctor. Maybe tell him it is for autism, but it\u2019s really an evaluation. This can 100% just be me projecting, but there\u2019s a very real possibility this is a lot deeper than you realize and can have severe consequences. And catching it before it manifests into more severe moods and behaviors can do a lot. Ages 12-14 are insanely critical in a person\u2019s development and having them plagued by mentally ill thoughts, speaking from experience, really does a lot of damage. I\u2019m not a doctor, once again this is all my own experience, but it just sounds very familiar and I wouldn\u2019t wish what I went through mentally in my early teens on my worst enemy. \n\n\nThere\u2019s also a real chance this is just teen hormones and wanting to find an identity as well. At 13, you become aware that you\u2019re a person and you know nothing about anything about yourself. Having a label like \u201cautistic\u201d can be very grounding and a source of identity. I realized I was gay when I was 12 and I made that the majority of my identity my early teens because that\u2019s all I knew about myself. It\u2019s scary to exist and not have a label. \n\nOr it could be both. In my experience, it was both. But I wouldn\u2019t take a chance because that amount of dedication with a goal of it being confirmed you have an awful illness is not right. It can be a wide range of things, from identity crisis to mental illness. I really would just get a professional opinion\n\nI definitely do think you could\u2019ve handled this way better though. If he is experiencing the feeling of invalidation, this definitely hurt even more than you realize. \n\nSincerely, a mentally ill girl who had an actual serious autistic brother", ">If she does get diagnosed, she\u2019s going to regret it.

They don\u2019t care if you are diagnosed or not, they will hone in on you and target you.\nHowever, if your child *is* autistic, then refusing to get them a diagnosis is **actively harming them.** It is taking away potential resources they could use as an autistic person, resources they NEED. I was lucky to get my diagnosis at 12, but so many autistic children go through their childhoods not realizing they have autism and are unable to get proper care for their needs. It\u2019s awful.\n\nIf you want your child to feel comfortable in their own skin, SUPPORT THEM. Let them figure themself out, listen to their concerns about potential medical issues they may have. Don\u2019t talk down to them and talk about how they\u2019re \u201cembarrassing\u201d. Is it possible they don\u2019t have autism? Yes. It is. But not only is your child not a medical professional, but you aren\u2019t. *I\u2019m* not, I can\u2019t diagnose them through the screen.

Is there a different form of neurodiversity going on here? Is she a hypochondriac? Is she acting out in such extreme ways for other reasons?\n\nI'd go to the doctor with your concerns about the changes in her behavior since her friend was diagnosed.\n\nEither way, I don't think brushing this under the rug and refusing to address the big emotions she's feeling right now is serving anyone in the long run.", "NAH.

They were just things that made my life *harder* and I kept blaming myself for that.\n\nHonestly in a perfect world everyone would get tested for everything. I know this isn't realistic across the board, especially when it costs money, but you should do what you can.\n\nI think of it very much like when I first got my eyesight tested at school when I was about 13 and found out I needed glasses. Up until I got glasses, I had NO IDEA my eyesight wasn't perfect. I couldn't see writing on the blackboard from the back of the room but I assumed neither could anyone else. Getting glasses pure melted my brain, I couldn't believe it, it was like getting a superpower.\n\nThere aren't any glasses for autism, but what there is, is knowing that so many of the things you've been beating yourself up for aren't a moral failure. Don't ever think that's a small thing to learn, especially for a child.\n\nConsider too that autism and being trans have been thought by many in those communities to have a lot of crossover - I don't know anything about the details of that, or if there are any studies, but I'm just mentioning it in case you're thinking these are two completely random things that your kid couldn't have BOTH of.\n\nIn both cases, there's no loss or longterm negative consequences to accepting these things might be true of your child.

Then I would take her in for a diagnosis. \n\nIt sounds like she doesn't have autism and just wants the attention that T is getting. Especiallynif she has been \"normal\" her whole life until the last few months. \n\nIf she has not exhibited any autism, signs or symptoms until very recently then I'd have a hard time believing shes autistic. \n\nBut before anything happens, you need to cut her off from T.

A diagnosis helped me greatly, never hurt. I always knew I was different. A diagnosis just helped me understand how and why and access resources and useful information. \n\nYour daughter may have always felt this way, but now she's learning the vocabulary to express what she's experiencing because of her friend. As a child, I called my socks 'itchy' because I didn't have a word for sensory overstimulation, and it baffled my parents. Now I have a word to describe these sensations and can more accurately identify when it's happening and do something about it. I turn my socks inside out so the seams don't touch me. I wear tank tops instead of tshirts. I wear headphones and sunglasses to the grocery store. Etc etc etc which I'm able to do because I better understand what I'm experiencing.\n\nIt's not uncommon for autistic women and girls especially to be misdiagnosed or just missed entirely. Before my autism diagnosis, I had been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. Anxiety and depression are often comorbid or even caused by living as an autistic person with no support. Bipolar is a fairly common misdiagnosis. With how dismissive you come off in this post, I wouldn't be surprised if your daughter didn't come to you with her special interests and her struggles. \n\nMaybe try just talking to her about this. Do some research about autism (especially autism in women). Ask her why she thinks she's autistic and what benefits she hopes would come from a diagnosis. Are there areas where she's struggling? Oftentimes looking at \"problem areas\" can help narrow down a diagnosis or just help identify what additional skills or coping mechanisms she may need your help with. If a professional assessment is inaccessible to you because of finances or anything else, help her get information from reliable sources. I recommend ASAN (Autistic Self Advocacy Network). Help her find autistic support groups, even just here on Reddit, to talk to. It can help to see other people's experiences and talk about your own. \n\nAnd honestly, even if this is just a \"phase,\" even if she does just want to be like her friend, consider what that means. Maybe she's not autistic, but what could be causing this? Is she struggling to fit in at school and make friends? Does she feel insufficient and is trying to figure out what's \"wrong\" with her? My younger sister thought she might be trans, and it ended up being more about gender/sex related trauma that she was struggling to work through. She needed help, not dismissal.

You can accept that this is part of your child's very normal exploration of their identity. Exploring identity is developmentally appropriate at your child's age. You can educate yourself to be a stable and safe influence to make sure your child isn't doing anything that permanently hurts their long term health.

But, not getting them support and good information would be harmful and a failure in parenting. If your child is not ASD or trans, support just gives them a safe chance to explore those possibilities and then move on to other identity elements that fit them better.

They can also be horrifically toxic places and a 13-year old may not be able to tell the difference. We have no idea what kind of fandom spaces she is in. You can all downvote me all you want, I\u2019m just sharing my experiences with it and voicing my concern.", "Nah because you continuously post it every single time.

I was also being seen for gender dysphoria though.", "It's completely possible the entire reason he identifies as a boy is because of how much easier autistic boys have it socially than girls. Being trans as an autistic person is not like being trans as an allistic person. Especially if the person is identifying as a child after extensive research on autism. Autistic boys and girls are treated drastically differently with drastically different social expectations\n\nI understand that gender is extremely important to a certain section of society but you're actually oversimplifying this. Gender is a *purely* social construct. He's not being hurt by a stranger on the internet misgendering him on a post he'll never read. Folks seriously need to start making a distinction between first person intentional and third person incidental misgendering because this has gotten out of hand. This is not about gender identity. It's about autism, socialization and gender assigned at birth. Full stop.", "Oh ok.", "I specifically mentioned a parent and their daughter. None of these people in your situation are your 13-year-old children.  Not a good comparison.", "Yes, it actually is.

And trust me, we don't tend to hate people who have a hard time but show that they're at least TRYING to correctly gender us.\n\nBut OP also just blew past that and continued to misgender him.

I suggest OP actually talk to their child because it seems like they don't know each other at all.", "Do you understand words like neurotypical and what that means, or do you need an in-depth explanation as to how sound logic works? Because it's not a coincidence. It's studied, documented, recorded fact.", "So the answer is no. You\u2019re showing how immensely ignorant & uneducated you are on the topic being discussed.

What I do is irrelevant to your child, but what's best practices for parenting is not irrelevant to your child.\n\nAlso, the clothing issue is a fake and you know it. Unless you were already forcing your child to wear things he hates without giving him a choice in the matter, totally unrelated to gender, you have already built in the correct mechanism for handling clothes: as your child outgrows or wears out former pieces, get his input in selecting the new ones and don't buy anything he didn't okay. That doesn't mean you have to buy anything new before you would be doing so anyhow. The fact that you're trying to use this as an excuse for refusing to acknowledge your child's gender identity tells me that you aren't being serious about your reasons -- you just don't like the fact that your child identifies as a boy, and you're inventing false obstacles so you don't have to acknowledge him.", "Women actually have to fight for a lot of very obvious and common diagnoses in America\u2026", "How many times have you been diagnosed with autism?
