If the babies started screaming it was understood one of the parents was to take the child into a bedroom and close the door so the rest of the family wouldn't have to endure the noise. With the exception of one sister (who only had to be told, there was no argument) there was never any debate about it. It was considered simple courtesy to the rest of the family. \n\nYou are under no obligation to adjust your life to accommodate your sister's offspring. I suspect a hint of jealousy on her part.", "NTA\n\nColic can be crazy nonstop. My aunt ended up in the hospital after birth and hired me to watch my cousin. \n\nDefinitely the worst babysitting experience I ever had. Obviously no one\u2019s fault but still.

Colic is horrible, a baby screaming his head off because of it, is equally horrible. I can understand you can't stand it when it goes on and on. You did not scold her, you just left the room.

My kid had it.  It was TOUGH.  I don't know HOW I got through it, but I had peace doing the best I could with her.  My husband on the other hand, he couldn't deal.  I told him to just go for a walk, a drink, anything.  It stressed him out.  I was stressed the first few times, but then I had a peace about it.  I knew I did everything I could.  She just had to cry.  NOT having a kid you are DEFINITELY unprepared to deal with that.  It is STRESSFUL to hear a baby cry for many people.  There is nothing wrong with leaving the room.", "NTA he's not your kid so you're under no obligation to deal with his screaming and crying nor do you owe your sister or her kid any of your free time.", "NTA. One of my twins had colic and the sound was just absolutely awful. I felt terrible for their pain, obviously, but I would never willingly be in a room with a child with colic unless it was *MY* child. It\u2019s a horrible sound from horrible pain. Andy isn\u2019t your child. What did she want you to do that she wasn\u2019t already doing? A colicky child wants their parent and wants to be comforted and for their pain to go away. They don\u2019t need a family member hovering and doing nothing. \n\nHer personal jab was most likely out of frustration and exhaustion, but it is still uncalled for.", "NTA, my 10 week old is colicky, sometimes I wish I could leave the room too.\n\nOn a serious note, it\u2019s not your child, nor your obligation to be help or even be present when the kiddo is singing the song of his people at the top of his lungs.

Look, I adore my niblings but what is your sister even talking about - at 6mo, there isn't much *to* spend time with, it's a baby.\n\nAlso, just because *she* is used to the screaming (which, being the parent, makes sense), doesn't mean everyone else should be.\n\nLast party I was at, my nephew started playing his goddamn iPad too loud - you're damn right I grabbed my drink and went outside by myself for a while.

The only reason I stayed in the room and didn't leave with my own child was because he was, well, MINE.\n\nEven so, his crying sent me through the freaking roof.

My son is 5 now, and his crying can still send me through the roof some days.\n\nYour sister is probably just miserable and wants you to be miserable with her.", "NTA\nI have a kid and at least once I had to leave the room because her crying was driving me insane. And this is from someone who is used to hearing her cry. For someone who is not used to this, it makes sense the sound would be grating. Especially with colic because there is nothing you can do to calm the baby, you just have to wait until they cry it out, and that can take hours. Who expects someone to sit there and listen to their baby cry for hours!?!? That's insane. And then to equate a perfectly reasonable desire to not be accosted in that way to not caring about the baby is ridiculous.", "Does she really think her kid is sooooo special and important you should stay to listen to its colicky cries?

Excuse yourself? Fine. But do you think anyone likes the sound of a colicky baby? Give you a hint. They don't. It's horrible. Your sister is exhausted, sleep deprived, anxious from being around that 24/7, and for you to stand up and say that you couldn't stand the sound had to feel like an ignorant slap in the face.

Do you have a history of making snide comments about your nephew and/or children in general, or do you just keep your opinions to yourself and try to keep the peace?  Are aunts and uncles expected to help out with or dote over their niblings by default in your family, or is it a more hands-off affair in general?", "ESH. You could have gotten up and left the room without the commentary which started the whole thing. Your sister was dealing with a colicky baby, it\u2019s unlikely she would have even noticed your empty seat. By announcing that the sound was bothering you, you were telling your sister \u201cyour child is annoying me.\u201d That\u2019s a horrible thing to do, *especially* when there\u2019s a child in pain. If you *had* to excuse yourself because that\u2019s the custom in your family, just say, \u201cexcuse me\u201d as you pass someone so it can be taken as excusing yourself from the room OR for maybe bumping someone. I\u2019ve never heard of anyone asking to be excused with a reason why. \u201cMay I be excused from the table?\u201d Not \u201cmay I be excused from the table because the Turkey is dry and I just don\u2019t like it?\u201d It makes you the rude one here. \n\nYour sister may have a valid point about you ignoring your nephew. The overall tone of your post suggests that to me, and she wasn\u2019t wrong for mentioning it. She *was* wrong for being judgmental and bringing any other part of your life into the situation and the name calling. \n\nIf your parents are anything like mine, they call you and agree with her and call her and agree with you, and then push both of you to be sorry. I get what my parents tried to do, but man alive, it was annoying when they did it! Whether your parents are reaching out to her as well or not, it doesn\u2019t really matter. They shouldn\u2019t be in this. \n\n\u201cParent, I understand what you are saying, and what Amy is saying about be spending more time with Andy. I recognize that she would like me to spend more time with him, and I appreciate that. My assumption has always been that she would like me to spend quality time with Andy, and me getting a splitting migraine from listening to him cry is not quality time, it\u2019s just sitting there, *not* spending time with him because she needs to tend to him, while I get an increasingly bad migraine during our family Christmas time. When I explained this to her, she attacked me work life and my personal life and my choices. I was not passing judgement on her, I was temporarily removing myself from a situation that was physically causing me pain. In response, she judged me unfairly and was attacking me. I recognize that I don\u2019t have a lot of time to spend with Andy because of work and my personal life, but that does not excuse her attacking my life choices loudly and unprovoked because her child was crying, and now I am being guilted by you because I left a room to avoid a migraine. Thank you for your input, but as you can see, I already understand everything that happened, and I am truly hurt by Amy\u2019s attack and your insistence on telling me I\u2019m wrong for not just letting her attack me. I have to get ready for [pick something even if it\u2019s not true] and I don\u2019t want to feel the way I feel right now when I get there. I love you, gotta go.

You are not responsible for or to her child. She has no right to tell you how an aunt must behave.  This is her child. Not yours.
