NTA.", "NTA. Not your kid, not your problem. Though you should know that colic is air in the bowels and it leaves the kid in excruciating pain. You still shouldn't be forced to listening to the ensuing crying, but a bit of empathy might sit well.", "NTA, you don't have to stay to hear the cry of a baby that isn't yours. But maybe you sounded too harsh, I can't know.", "NTA...you tried to politely excuse yourself. They made it a personal attack. You're not obligated to share in the baby's discomfort,  and it doesn't mean that you don't care.", "Colic is essentially a very painful stomachache that lots of infants get. He was crying like that because he was hurting.\n\nYou're NTA for wanting to distance yourself, though. Some people just don't get along well with babies/children. There's nothing wrong with that. I can understand why your sister might want you to be more involved in your nephew's life, but that's your choice to make, not hers. It doesn't make you an asshole if you decide not to.", "NTA. A crying baby is evolutionarily designed to be distressing so the adults can help the baby. Except with colic there ain't much to do so kid keeps screaming (sucks for everyone). You as not the parent are perfectly reasonable in removing yourself. Her personal attacks and your parents agreeing were way outta line.\n\nWonder if this was also some sexist \"you are a woman and therefore should love children\" nonsense since her attack was the work and slut shaming combo.", "NTA.\n\nYou wouldve been if you told them to leave the room with the kid or something, but you getting away from a situation where you are close to getting headaches is no where near being an AH", "NTA at least you didn't insist she leave with him.", "NTA\n\nYou excused yourself from an irritating situation and that was the proper way to handle yourself.", "NTA. Some cries of babys can bring headachs, so it is completly normal that you want to leave the room.\n\nIt is not your child. And the positive site of being a aunt and not a mother is, that you can give a crying baby back to its parents.", "Lol NTA\n\nNot your monkeys, not your circus", "NTA - if you niece has colic - your sis is probably majorly sleep deprived, going crazy, angry, and frankly jealous of the silence.   \n\nI have kids- crying babies is such a difficult sound. It gets straight into the nerves. You are N T AH for leaving the room.   \n\nSome kids cry a lot. Your sister hopefully has decent medical help. Things like the football hold, different ways to feed the baby, and even getting tested for allergies to formulas are super important. But... some babies just cry a lot.", "NTA, the screaming was bothering you, there was nothing you could do about it, so you left the room so you wouldn't have to hear it. It was not like you could play with the kid when he was like that, so what was their real problem, they couldn't leave the room?", "Nta", "NTA I had 2 babies and still can\u2019t stand listening to other\u2019s cry. I would have left too.", "I hate it when people are all \"well they're just kid duh you were one duh\"\nYeah and that doesn't make any freaking difference about the inconvenience you're experiencing. You didn't do anything to the kid nor criticised the mom.

While house rules are slightly more relaxed, the same principle exists: while her child having colic is neither her fault nor the child\u2019s, that awful crying should not be imposed on other people. By taking yourself out of the room, you were actually being polite.\n\nYour sister is the asshole here and your parents are enabling it. She clearly resents your single life and that you are either having fun and/or making good choices about not dating people long term if you are not compatible with them. I do get that she\u2019s probably exhausted and irritable, but that\u2019s no reason to be rude to you.", "YTA but not for being unwilling or unable to tolerate the crying/screaming.  YTA because you juuuuust HAD to say something snarky instead of just excusing yourself.  \n\u201cSomething called colic\u201d ????!

So I have to stay & be in pain because they are? Um, nope, not happening. \n\nI absolutely sympathize with the kid. That kind of pain is awful.

It probably makes for quality family time if all choose to suffer collectively.", "NTA. Removing yourself from noise overload isn't a bad thing.

But as someone who has had a baby with colic your sister is probably extremely stressed. It\u2019s one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever been through and makes you very irritable.
