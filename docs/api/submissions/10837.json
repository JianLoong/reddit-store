For context, my family and I live with James\u2019 family (mom, Justine 43, brother, Liam 19, and grandmother, Kris 59), after we had some major financial struggles back in 2022. They offered for us to live with them, to help us build our money back up and also help us raise our two children. We took the offer, and since then, everything has been very amazing since we moved in.\n\nLiam has a girlfriend, Laura 18, and since she found out we were having our second child, has been very overbearing. We\u2019ve had many issues in the past when it comes to her and our first child, and now, James and I are anticipating that it\u2019ll be that way again. I understand the excitement of a new baby, but the way she shows it\u2026 I\u2019ll be the first to say, is a little stalker-ish/weird. She constantly messages me with one of the following: wanting bump photos to show random people I do NOT know (her teachers, friends, etc), updates on how many days till my planned c-section, or asking me intimate details about DR appointments (many of which I never told her about). In person, she will talk to my stomach, saying \u201cauntie\u2019s baby\u201d, \u201cmy gorgeous little baby\u201d, or something similar. When we told everyone that we weren\u2019t doing a gender reveal/baby shower, she was the most upset over the entire thing, saying that \u201cshe wanted to plan it\u201d and that \u201cshe was so excited to have people together\u201d.\n\nRecently, Laura and I had an argument that led in a fallout between everyone. The event that caused this, was when Laura forced my daughter to come with her from Justine\u2019s room (when my daughter wanted to stay with her nana) and my daughter had a breath-holding spell (started because she was forced to do something she didn\u2019t want to), leading to Laura holding her in a hug and blowing in her face to try and get her to breathe. My daughter didn\u2019t breathe for over 15 seconds, and the reason myself and James were so upset was because Laura refused to bring my daughter to me like I asked; Laura claimed she wanted to \u201cshow my daughter that she was kind\u201d and that \u201cauntie cares about HER baby\u201d, which this was absolutely not how to attempt that. Like I said, this led to an argument that caused me to tell Laura to get the f- out, and to stop using our children as her little \u201csurrogate babies\u201d, as she has no kids of her own.\n\nLiam and Justine are upset with me and James for \u201coverreacting\u201d, on top of some members of her family messaging me to say that I am an a-hole for treating her the way I did. Kris is 100% supportive of what I did and says she would have done the same thing if she was in my position.

There IS financial support for young couples trying to buy their first home, if that helps.  Or consider shifting rooms if there's enough space, to physically keep Liam's GF blocked from access. Everyone has to be on board for a parent to protect oneself and one's children in a group living situation.  NTA and YWNBTA to insist on a family meeting about this - what happened, why it is upsetting, and how to prevent this in the future.  Good luck!", "Deep breath, Mama. You got this. \n\nNTA for setting boundaries for your children. Any family member should return your children to you immediately when you ask. \n\nOne of the issues with a communal living situation is that the \"help\" comes with a lot of issues. One of those is everyone's input into your child rearing strategies. Which sucks. I've been there, done that. \n\nAs the mom of a now grown \"expert\" level breath holder. I understand the panic and concern. I really do. I vividly recall the first time my oldest passed out. I was about your age, pregnant with a toddler, and I was a bit of a mess. But it's not damaging to the child. As hard as it is to watch. \n\nSince moving out is not an option at this point. I think you will need to have a conversation with Laura with someone else present as well maybe a family meeting?. Explain to her that you feel like she is treating you like a uterus not a person with privacy needs. Or a parent with the final say on your children. \n\nAnd your daughter is not a doll.

My stepdaughter is from young teen parents, her boyfriend from generational young parents, so no surprise she got knocked up at 20. The babyshower had greatgrandmas in their 50s ffs..yikes!

Laura definitely needs stronger boundaries set.\n\nI'd suggest that consider making your next step be to shut down the whole \"auntie\" thing. And I say that as a parent whose spouse has two close friends that we use that term when referring to them with our kids. But that was a title that we bestowed. They did not claim it themselves.\n\nWhere here, you don't say it, but it sounds like she bestowed it upon herself. It so, shut it down. Go full \"All the garbage compactors on the detention level\" shut down.\n\nShe is not their \"auntie\", she's BILs GF. He may think this relationship is serious and long term, but you don't have to put up with her claiming a kinship that isn't there. He may not like it. She definitely won't like it. But it's not up to them.\n\nOne reason I suggest this is that this whole \"auntie\" business is likely part and parcel with the root of the boundary stomping. She's claimed the title, and probably has a whole exagerated notion of what it means.\n\nDisabusing her of her claim will help emphasize that she is, in the eyes of you and your husband, nothing mors or less than the girl BIL happens to be dating. Get ger straightened out there and it should become easier to straighten her out on other issues.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that even if she does end up marrying BIL, that will make her your kids aunt. Doesn't mean she'll have earned being an \"auntie\". They are, imo, not the same.\n\n\"Aunt\" is the formal relationship of family connection. \"Auntie\" is an indicator of a close personal bond, as much between the parents and the \"auntie\" as anything with the child (more really). That latter relationship is clearly not there.", "Girl, Laura seems crazy. I honestly would not let her anywhere near my family", "NTA - but, general life advice, stop reproducing until you can financially afford to not be living with your in-laws (and their girlfriends).", "NTA.\nThe fact that you have members of HER family texting you calling you an a-hole already tell us all we need to know about her.\nAnyway, the fact that your mother in law agree with you is good enough. It\u2019s her house, and we\u2019ll\u2026 your brother in law obviously think you\u2019re overreacting because he\u2019s immature, just as his girlfriend.\nAnd it\u2019s your daughter, a little human, with feelings, needs, fears, not a doll that can be held anytime whenever she wants.", "Nta", "NTA", "Nta I\u2019d be livid my one twin has breathe hold spells and I\u2019m the only one to calm him down.

She doesn't have to be where you live because she doesn't live there.  Sure Liam does, but perhaps he might want to go live with her at her house?\n\nHow soon before you can move out?  That will be the best way to get yourself away from her because you don't have have ultimate say whether she can be there or not because it's not your house.", "NTA.

I started teaching my daughter about boundary consent at 7 months old, and she is very expressive even to us (her parents and family) on when she is okay with something (ex: I ask for a hug, kiss, or high-five and she decides which one she would rather do). You are never too young to learn about consent of your own body! :)", "Agreed! It\u2019s why we have a small circle in the first place.

It is so frustrating to us.", "I appreciate the support. Husband and I have been stressed over the entire thing, and we are just trying to find some type of common ground with everyone, but if it doesn\u2019t work the way where it is safe for our child, we will happily leave the home!", "Go mom protect your baby", "NTA - based on this, it sounds as if you have support from all of your husband's family that matters except his brother. His opinion really doesn't count here. He needs to tell his GF to keep her hands and creepy behaviors away from you and his niece. Frankly this woman should not be allowed back in the house or anywhere near your daughter until she has confirmed in writing that she will respect all boundaries laid out. One strike and she never comes near your child again. This is just too bizarre and too dangerous to be tolerated. If your BIL wants to hang out with this chick, that's his issue but he has no right to endanger your daughter thru any further interaction.", "IMO, she is very entitled. The behavior doesn\u2019t shock me, but it isn\u2019t going to happen when it comes to my kids", "She hasn\u2019t come back since it happened (thank god). Husband\u2019s grandmother says it is up to us what happens next, which is great and well appreciated"]}
