For context, my family and I live with James\u2019 family (mom, Justine 43, brother, Liam 19, and grandmother, Kris 59), after we had some major financial struggles back in 2022. They offered for us to live with them, to help us build our money back up and also help us raise our two children. We took the offer, and since then, everything has been very amazing since we moved in.\n\nLiam has a girlfriend, Laura 18, and since she found out we were having our second child, has been very overbearing. We\u2019ve had many issues in the past when it comes to her and our first child, and now, James and I are anticipating that it\u2019ll be that way again. I understand the excitement of a new baby, but the way she shows it\u2026 I\u2019ll be the first to say, is a little stalker-ish/weird. She constantly messages me with one of the following: wanting bump photos to show random people I do NOT know (her teachers, friends, etc), updates on how many days till my planned c-section, or asking me intimate details about DR appointments (many of which I never told her about). In person, she will talk to my stomach, saying \u201cauntie\u2019s baby\u201d, \u201cmy gorgeous little baby\u201d, or something similar. When we told everyone that we weren\u2019t doing a gender reveal/baby shower, she was the most upset over the entire thing, saying that \u201cshe wanted to plan it\u201d and that \u201cshe was so excited to have people together\u201d.\n\nRecently, Laura and I had an argument that led in a fallout between everyone. The event that caused this, was when Laura forced my daughter to come with her from Justine\u2019s room (when my daughter wanted to stay with her nana) and my daughter had a breath-holding spell (started because she was forced to do something she didn\u2019t want to), leading to Laura holding her in a hug and blowing in her face to try and get her to breathe. My daughter didn\u2019t breathe for over 15 seconds, and the reason myself and James were so upset was because Laura refused to bring my daughter to me like I asked; Laura claimed she wanted to \u201cshow my daughter that she was kind\u201d and that \u201cauntie cares about HER baby\u201d, which this was absolutely not how to attempt that. Like I said, this led to an argument that caused me to tell Laura to get the f- out, and to stop using our children as her little \u201csurrogate babies\u201d, as she has no kids of her own.\n\nLiam and Justine are upset with me and James for \u201coverreacting\u201d, on top of some members of her family messaging me to say that I am an a-hole for treating her the way I did. Kris is 100% supportive of what I did and says she would have done the same thing if she was in my position. I have not spoken to her since the incident, and we both are trying to figure out a way to address this. \n\nAITA for this?

This is just weird behaviour.", "If Liam and Justine are 'upset with\" OP for \"overreacting\", OP and Husband need to think very carefully about MOVING OUT.  By taking the side of Liam's GF, the child's grandmother isn't respecting the parents' rules, this would be a terrible situation to stay in, let alone bring another child into the mix.  Husband's grandmother understands, but is waiting for OP to make a move.\n\nThat should literally be the case.  There IS financial support for young couples trying to buy their first home, if that helps.  Or consider shifting rooms if there's enough space, to physically keep Liam's GF blocked from access. Everyone has to be on board for a parent to protect oneself and one's children in a group living situation.  NTA and YWNBTA to insist on a family meeting about this - what happened, why it is upsetting, and how to prevent this in the future.  Good luck!", "Deep breath, Mama. You got this. \n\nNTA for setting boundaries for your children. Any family member should return your children to you immediately when you ask. \n\nOne of the issues with a communal living situation is that the \"help\" comes with a lot of issues. One of those is everyone's input into your child rearing strategies. Which sucks. I've been there, done that. \n\nAs the mom of a now grown \"expert\" level breath holder. I understand the panic and concern. I really do. I vividly recall the first time my oldest passed out. I was about your age, pregnant with a toddler, and I was a bit of a mess. But it's not damaging to the child. As hard as it is to watch. \n\nSince moving out is not an option at this point. I think you will need to have a conversation with Laura with someone else present as well maybe a family meeting?. Explain to her that you feel like she is treating you like a uterus not a person with privacy needs. Or a parent with the final say on your children. \n\nAnd your daughter is not a doll. Relationships take time to build. You expect her to return your child to you as soon as you ask. No exceptions. \n\nGood luck mama\ud83d\udc95", "NTA\n\nWhen i had my first son last year my older sister who doesnt have access to her kids because shes a drunk. Started referring to my son in msgs etc as \"MY baby\" so msgs like \"hows MY baby?\" It lasted two weeks before i asked her to stop saying it because it made me extremely uncomfortable cause i never once did that with her kids id always ask how my niece or nephew was. So i can understand why you snapped cause i cannot explain hearing someone else refer to ur child as \"my baby\" is iky", "op=NTA\n\nBut I wouldn't be leaving my kid alone with her(and don't send her baby bump pix, and keep her on low info diet).  \n\nYou should try to find out who's giving her dr appt info(maybe give false dates to different people and see which one she finds out about?)", "Yikes. NTA. I have no advice that would mend this as the only words I have for your SIL are not G rated lol seriously she needs to back off she\u2019s being creepy!", "NTA", "NTA. This person sounds dangerous. I'm worried that her behavior might escalate. My biggest concern would be her taking one or both of your children or potentially causing you bodily harm. Maybe I'm just paranoid but, I'd be terrified to let my kids out of my sight or be in a room alone with her. She sounds incredibly unstable", "We have had a lot of boundary problems with her, and we have expressed to her multiple times about following them, but that lasts like 2 seconds before she goes back to being disrespectful.

It\u2019s just an all around garbage situation.", "That\u2019s what it seemed like she did, honestly.

When BIL went to get my daughter from her, she got mad about it, which what makes me believe she was in a refusal mode about giving her back", "We have addressed it multiple times as my daughter got older. Not only us, but MIL has done it too on different occasions. We\u2019ve even gone as far as to give SIL tips on what can help her make my daughter comfortable, and she just disregards everything every time she comes over", "I don\u2019t have much experience with babies but the one fundamental rule I know in my bones is that if a child is upset or having any sort of tantrum when the parent is nearby, you immediately hand them back to a parent (unless the parent has asked for a break). It\u2019s not complicated at all, just let the parents comfort their child. Laura\u2019s behaviour is seriously concerning, and I think you and your child would benefit from a bit of time away from her", "NTA - but maybe don't let her be around your kiddo until she can behave. Lol", "She hasn\u2019t been back since it happened, but everyone knows that her father and I are her safe place; if she is freaking out, give her back. We just don\u2019t get why she can\u2019t understand that", "Absolutely! She hasn\u2019t been back since, and my husbands grandmother says it is up to us what happens next.", "So she\u2019s fully aware of this rule and still can\u2019t understand why she was wrong.
