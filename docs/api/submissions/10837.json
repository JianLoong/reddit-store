You got this. \n\nNTA for setting boundaries for your children.

One of those is everyone's input into your child rearing strategies. Which sucks. I've been there, done that. \n\nAs the mom of a now grown \"expert\" level breath holder. I understand the panic and concern. I really do. I vividly recall the first time my oldest passed out. I was about your age, pregnant with a toddler, and I was a bit of a mess.

My stepdaughter is from young teen parents, her boyfriend from generational young parents, so no surprise she got knocked up at 20. The babyshower had greatgrandmas in their 50s ffs..yikes!

Laura definitely needs stronger boundaries set.\n\nI'd suggest that consider making your next step be to shut down the whole \"auntie\" thing. And I say that as a parent whose spouse has two close friends that we use that term when referring to them with our kids. But that was a title that we bestowed. They did not claim it themselves.\n\nWhere here, you don't say it, but it sounds like she bestowed it upon herself. It so, shut it down. Go full \"All the garbage compactors on the detention level\" shut down.\n\nShe is not their \"auntie\", she's BILs GF. He may think this relationship is serious and long term, but you don't have to put up with her claiming a kinship that isn't there. He may not like it. She definitely won't like it. But it's not up to them.\n\nOne reason I suggest this is that this whole \"auntie\" business is likely part and parcel with the root of the boundary stomping. She's claimed the title, and probably has a whole exagerated notion of what it means.\n\nDisabusing her of her claim will help emphasize that she is, in the eyes of you and your husband, nothing mors or less than the girl BIL happens to be dating. Get ger straightened out there and it should become easier to straighten her out on other issues.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that even if she does end up marrying BIL, that will make her your kids aunt. Doesn't mean she'll have earned being an \"auntie\". They are, imo, not the same.\n\n\"Aunt\" is the formal relationship of family connection. \"Auntie\" is an indicator of a close personal bond, as much between the parents and the \"auntie\" as anything with the child (more really).

His opinion really doesn't count here. He needs to tell his GF to keep her hands and creepy behaviors away from you and his niece. Frankly this woman should not be allowed back in the house or anywhere near your daughter until she has confirmed in writing that she will respect all boundaries laid out. One strike and she never comes near your child again. This is just too bizarre and too dangerous to be tolerated. If your BIL wants to hang out with this chick, that's his issue but he has no right to endanger your daughter thru any further interaction.", "IMO, she is very entitled.

Neither of us try to force our affection on the little one, nor do we call them our baby. We do not step in to parent the little one or cross any lines what so ever. This in my opinion is the way an aunt and uncle should be. We love the little one with all our hearts but we are not their parents. She needs to get that through her thick skull.\n\nForcing a hug and blowing on the child\u2019s face is a great way to become the least favorite person in that child\u2019s life.

Mom of three and frankly if anything you're all underreacting.\n\nLaura is not a safe person to be around your children. Anyone who refuses to give you your child when you tell them to (asking isn't even necessary, it's YOUR child) is not a safe person. Anyone who uses physical force on your child, especially without your consent, is not a safe person.\n\n(Yes, there are exceptions. Laura's behavior fits into no sane exceptions.)\n\nLaura is at best immature and entitled, but she has had the rules explained to her multiple times and continues to choose to think she should be an exception to them. Seeing as she is not four years old, that means she is not a safe person to be around your children.\n\nShift things a little. If this were a fifty year old man instead of an eighteen year old woman, would you be less horrified? More horrified? Just as horrified? If this were someone you didn't know at all, would it be suddenly okay behavior?\n\nWhat I'm trying to point out is, Laura has a pattern of behavior which is not acceptable and is not safe - physically or emotionally - for your child, and she is being enabled by Liam and Justine. All of them are in the wrong. You are not. They need to not be around your child (and definitely not without you being quite literally within arms' reach of your child) until they get with the program.", "NTA that\u2019s very alarming when she wouldn\u2019t give you your baby back, especially when your baby was crying and holding her breath", "ESH\n\nLaura sucks, but you and yout husband also suck for not putting your foot down immediately, grow some\nspines and protect your children more viciously next time.", "but when babies/toddlers/young kids do this, it\u2019s usually a way of trying to cope when they\u2019re extremely distressed. it means they\u2019re having difficulty calming down and someone they think is safe needs to help calm them down", "This is great! It should be enough that you're the parent and get to set rules, but clearly, that's not sticking with Laura. Have you talked to Laura about this and why it's important?  If you haven't yet, it might be worth a shot to sit down with her and explain some things. It kind of sounds like she's having some pretty intense \"main character syndrome,\" and she needs a discussion about how her actions are impacting others, and the ways that makes it so she won't get what she wants. For example, in the situation you described, it's honestly kind of clear to me that the reason your daughter doesn't seem to want to interact with Laura and Laura feels the need to \"show she's nice\" is that your daughter doesn't trust her. Presumably, everyone else in her life respects your daughter's wishes except Laura, so why the hell would your daughter trust and want to spend time with her?\n\nHere's an example:\n\n\"Laura, I understand that you're excited and want to spend time with [daughter], but [daughter] isn't a doll. She's a person with thoughts, feelings, and ideas of her own. As her parents, it's our job to set boundaries that make sure she feels safe, and when you don't follow our rules and respect her boundaries, it makes her feel unsafe. How would you feel if you were doing something and someone just picked you up and moved you because they wanted to? Kids have the same kinds of feelings that adults do; they just don't have the language to express them. That's why when they get frustrated, they cry, scream, or hold their breath. That's also why it's important to give them the space to express themselves in ways they can *before* putting them in a situation where they don't have the language. \n\nRight now, [daughter] doesn't trust you because she knows you don't respect her boundaries. If you want her to see you as fun and kind, you need to earn that trust back with her.\"\n\n\nI'd also use similar discussions about boundaries, feelings, trust, etc, to talk about why her behavior towars you and your pregnancy needs to change"]}
