Your are not responsible for her feelings. She is having a temper tantrum right now so apologising and trying to make it up to her would be a very bad idea.  It is like giving in to a child's temper tantrum and giving her the go ahead for her to continue her behaviour. You have to concentrate on correcting her behaviour and not caring about her feelings.

It\u2019s a tough age with being in college though but maybe just keep your personal life more personal and on a \u201cneed to know\u201d basis - which is also more of an adult thing.

Not sure where you are but that's a pretty extreme view in the US... mostly) and the silent treatment IS an established manipulation tactic, though she may not realize she's using it, tbf. Still, some therapy to find the best solution for the situation. My go to is to play the game back and stand your ground. Establish you're an adult and it won't work anymore.
