I attend university in another city (it's a two hour ride from my hometown), I work a part time job so that I can afford some of my expenses, but my mother sends me some extra allowance every month. I also visit her every now and then whenever I can find the time.\n\nI had a few days off from work and I decided to visit her. The thing is I've been online-dating this guy (21M) for five months, and together we made plans so that he can visit me in my place and spend a couple of days here. I live in a pretty touristic spot so I thought I could show him around and we could have a good time together. When I told my mom about this, she got visibly upset, and said: \"I don't want him to stay with you.\" She met my boyfriend before through facetime and phone calls, so I didn't get her reasoning for that. We argued over it for a bit and then she asked me flatly whether I will have sex with him or not. That made me really uncomfortable, she then proceeded to explain how it was \"too early for me\", and that I should wait at least I'm about 24-25 before even getting a boyfriend. She was also upset about me having a boyfriend from the get go, but I hadn't paid much attention to it before.\n\nI then told her I needed some boundaries, and that she can't interfere with my life like that, and that I was sick of her controlling attitude. I didn't insult her or anything but I was pretty angry, so she got upset (again) and gave me the silent treatment afterwards (she does this whenever we have an argument). She hasn't talked to me much since yesterday and I'm a bit worried I might have hurt her. I really didn't know how else to word this so I just went with what I felt was right. I'm thinking about how I can make it up to her but I can't give up on meeting my boyfriend, I really like him and I was genuinely looking forward to this.\n\nSo AITA for telling my mom off?", "created_utc": 1679050734, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11tntaq/aita_for_telling_my_mom_off_because_of_her/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand a mothers worry but she wasn't expressing that, she basically trying to tell you what to do.", "NTA and you don't need to make it up to your mom, you did nothing wrong.

Your mom needs to understand that.", "NTA\n\nYou're an adult, you can decide what you want. I feel like your mom was upset cause you would spend time with your bf and not with her as much.\n\nBe the adult and talk it out.", "NTA even slightly. Parents are uncomfortable that their adult children have sex, I get it, but they have absolutely no right to be telling them when to have sex. \n\nThis is an incredibly reasonable boundary. It seems like your mum is having a hard time with the reality that you're a grown person. But every parent has to come to terms with that. It's not your job to make her feel better about it.", "NTAH  but when we react with anger we do tend to be pretty harsh and then people can't really hear us through their defense reaction.  You are 20. Old enough to decide for yourself but a talk with her when you're both calm would help. She's worried.  She's your mom that's always going to happen when you grow up and away from her baby.  Just assure her that she taught you well, you'll be careful about pregnancy and everything else that comes with sex.\nRemember you'll probably have a few boyfriends in your life, just one mom.\nGood luck \ud83e\udd1e\u270c", "This is 100% controlling behavior, sprinkled with drops of \"silent treatment\" manipulation.\n\nYour mother is manipulating you and wants to control your life, and thinks she has right for it just because you are her daughter.\n\nRegardless if she's your mother or a total stranger, do not give in and let them dictate how you live your life, especially the harmless one, like your situation at the moment.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

You are an adult and can certainly have a boyfriend and have sex if you choose to.

Your mother's feelings on this matter are not your concern. By my maths, she had you at 17, and she may be afraid that you too would become a young mother. This is still none of her business, and you have nothing to make up for. She is overstepping.", "NTA ,but thats your mama. Find out why she has a problem with you having sex. If she can articulate why and you still dont agree, so be it, but dont dismiss your mom simply because she has different views.

Better to start putting boundaries in place and keep telling her no you are an adult now. \n\nSilent treatment is an abusive tactic to keep someone in line and agree for the sake of peace.

My daughter (20f) was uninvited to Christmas by her mom (my ex - divorced 12 years ago) because she did not approve of her boyfriend. It was the final straw that exposed her control game. \n\nKeep you space. Be prepared to get your monthly stipend withdrawn and create a life that allows you to be happy.
