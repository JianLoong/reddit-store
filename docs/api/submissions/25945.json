To say the least the relationship has always been kinder rocky. He has two young boys 7 and 9. My partner works FIFO 2on/2off. We only have his kids over when he is off work on the weekends and holidays. I have no kids. \n\nHis salary is above 200k, I myself work and my salary is around 130k. He pays child support of $1200 a month, plus all other expenses that the kids needs, and i mean everything. Which i understand that is his duty to do so. Where I am completely divided with this is he makes comments on how I spend my income... that i spend to much on clothes, I have a package coming every other week, that I am too much and too high maintenance because I can afford these things for myself. I rarely spend on him and he rarely spends on me. \n\nWe have taken the kids on countless holidays and the biggest being Tokyo which i paid half the trip for! Approx 10K \n\nThe mother lives a lavish lifestyle but because the kids always come over and tell us that they rarely do any activities with their mum, they are constantly asking us to buy them this and that because mum doesn't... my partner hates it and therefor spends everything on the kids. I refuse to believe that she can't afford to pay 50/50 for the kids expenses. And because of this situation I can't help but feel that I am just the other woman in this situation because he supports her lifestyle, pays her rent plus all kids expenses but complains about mine. That it's his family and then there's me. Him and I split the rent but he doesn't pay any of the bills except the internet. \n\nSo with saying all of that, I have decided that I want nothing to do  about their ever changing child support arrangements, and that I won't be assisting covering any expense whenever the kids are with us or at all. She works and is able to pay for kids expenses too.

NTA. And to complain that you are frivolous with your earnings while seeking financial assistance from you is really nervy of him.\n\nAgain, NTA. Renegotiate your household contract with him and stop paying for everything so that he can give more to someone else while criticizing your commitment.\n\n(His kids deserve HIS support. But, when did the court say anyone is allowed to attach yours?)", "I just think this isn't the relationship for you.", "NTA. You are clearly a second class participant in this relationship.  If that is okay for you, then your position is fine but I would expect him to pay more for the expenses as he is another adult living in the home.  \nMy concern is you selling yourself short.  Do you really believe that you are only entitled to leftovers.  Another woman's children based on his schedule.  What's left over from his income. What are you getting out of this. Decide your value and then look at what you have", "If I am understanding correctly - NTA. You should not have a say in how he spends his money on his children and he should have no say in how you spend your money. You in no way should EVER be expected to pay toward the children's expenses. I do wonder - when he makes a comment about you spending too much on clothes, do you ever give him a hard shut down? Something like, \"I don't see why this is a concern of yours. I pay my bills and I have spending money.\" Don't let resentment simmer - establish boundaries.\n\n   Having said this - I think you would do well to move on from this relationship. You do not sound like a priority.", "NTA, but if you plan to stay with this man forever this is going to be an issue you should sit down and solve now before he resents you for not funding the kids, or you resent him for making you fund the kids. If your relationship has already been rocky already I'd consider if staying is worth it to you, because money will only make it rockier.", "NTA. \n\n>  my partner thinks I\u2019m an asshole for wanting no part in it.\n\nInteresting because it sounds like he tells you basically what he provides for over and above calculated child support is none of your business.\n\nYou two split the rent but the only utility he pays for is internet?  Doesn\u2019t seem fair when you both live there as well as his kids some of the time. \nIf his kids are asking to be taken on lavish trips etc, you should pay your cost only, he should pay his and theirs.", "NTA but it sounds to me like he\u2019s using you to support HIM. Can he afford the rent and expenses on his own?  As it stands now,I doubt it. Step back and take a deep breath. Your arrangement is not equitable.", "NTA, not your kids, not your responsability, his parents are the ones who need to support them and you have no part in that", "NTA but it's time to find a new boyfriend. Those are his kids and his responsibility, if you don't want the baggage that he comes with, it is time to move on.", ">Where I am completely divided with this is he makes comments on how I spend my income... that i spend to much on clothes, I have a package coming every other week, that I am too much and too high maintenance because I can afford these things for myself.\n\nThis begs the question of why he is engaged to you then.\n\n>he supports her lifestyle, pays her rent plus all kids expenses but complains about mine.\n\n>I have decided that I want nothing to do about their ever changing child support arrangements, and that I won't be assisting covering any expense whenever the kids are with us or at all.\n\nYou two should definitely reconsider getting married.\n\nESH", "I think it\u2019s time for you to get out of this relationship. If you think it\u2019s going to get any better after being with him for three years, you are sadly mistaken. It\u2019s only going to get worse because kids get more expensive not less. It\u2019s time for you to seek out someone to have your own children with. If you have children with him, the situation will be exponentially more complicated. And when it comes crashing down, then your kids will have to split their time with him and there will be stepchildren in the fall and it will be a big mess. Cut your losses and move on. You are not the AH in this.", "INFO: \n\nHave the courts been involved in determining child support payments? On average, how much would you say he is paying when you include the $1200 and the rent and stuff? Not including the \u201cthis and that\u201d that he decides to buy them for their enjoyment. \n\nBecause not including the rent and expenses\u2014the amount of outright child support he is paying is 1200 a month. That\u2019s $600 a kid per month. \n\nThat\u2019s how much my dad paid in child support and he made nowhere near 200k.", "NTA, your husband can spend his money which ever way he chooses but has no right to comment on your finances.\nIt would be ridiculous of you not being able to spend money, that you earn, on yourself.", "NTA This isn\u2019t a step problem. This is a bf problem. He\u2019s expecting you to be equally financially for the kids. He is already dipping out of paying his 50% share of the house hold expenses. Just the rent and internet isn\u2019t enough. \n\nIf you think there\u2019s a future with this guy, go one step further and request he pays 50% of the utilities and food and start insisting that the kids\u2019 needs are taken out of the equation when looking at your partnership with him. \n\nBut if he refuses, time to leave.", "NTA he shouldn\u2019t criticize how you spend your money. Those are your lifestyle choices just like having kids was his lifestyle choice. The fact that you pay all the bills except the internet, yikes. You\u2019re subsidizing this guy.", "NTA he shouldn't tell you how to spend your money, but it sounds like you need to think if he is really worth it.", "NTA but you're being used.", "NTA.  Just get out - he is still financially under his ex's thumb and will just drain you for her.", "NTA. Get gone. You are always going to play second fiddle to the original family.", "ESH\n\nI think your point was fine, but your stand of I will never contribute EVER is completely wrong. \n\nI do that shit when I think I\u2019m taking some kind of moral stand, but you just don\u2019t see how odd you look. It\u2019s not reasonable to have children in your life, which you consciously chose, and not contribute. It can\u2019t be zero.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
