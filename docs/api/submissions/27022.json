{"id": 27022, "submission_id": "16kn673", "title": "AITA for wanting my mentally ill stepdaughter to move out because she doesn't work?", "selftext": "Me (43M) and my wife (45) have lived together for 12 years. My stepdaughter Kat (24) does not work and lives with us. I work full time, my wife sometimes part time.\r  \nKat suffers from severe social anxiety, and has written a note to her mother about not wanting to live anymore when she was only 14; reason being that she was too afraid to go to school. She's been through three therapists since and has been with the fourth for over a year now. She would leave therapy for a while, then 'relapse' and return a few months/years later. \r  \n\r  \nThis might sound callous, but even though she has been officially diagnosed, Kat's disorder is not very visible. She's very introverted and dislikes family gatherings, prefers staying at home over doing any activity and even going on vacation with us, but that aside she's normal. She can hold a conversation fine, and has plenty of online friends that she talks to daily. It never seemed like a huge issue, as she did graduate just fine, but it's become a problem ever since said graduation.  \n\r  \nKat went to university and even moved out to do so for a year, but came back home after not attending classes after the first month and then obviously failing them. She claims it was because classes were too difficult to keep up with while also having to be among people all day, so she stopped going and shut herself in her dorm room.   \nI know she's not stupid, but she is also not very ambitious. This is another problem, as she has had severe difficulty finding work after she's come home. She worked for a few weeks after we found her a job working in a school kitchen, but was fired. Her work ethic as a whole was reportedly okay - again, not stupid, just little effort.   \nSince then, she's applied to very few jobs and gotten no interviews. She specifies her disorder in every job application. I believe this is a stupid idea, as employers would probably skip over any applicants that have issues from the get go, especially because she doesn't outwardly show that she has a disorder anyway. I think Kat knows this as well, and does it on purpose.\r  \n\r  \nAfter so many years of being in and out of therapy for something that she has always lived/managed with, I can't help but feel like she has just weaponized it to not have to work.   \nMy wife supports her daughter fully, and has even taken on to working herself so that she doesn't feel guilty about me supporting her daughter. She doesn't have to do this; I make enough money for all three of us and Kat doesn't cause any expenses beyond food and affordable clothing. Kat feels guilty in turn because of this, but nothing has changed with her behavior.   \nI think it would be better if Kat just worked and moved out to learn some independence. My wife thinks this would only make Kat miserable and that we should support her since she is 'working on it' in therapy. I don't know how long we have to wait until Kat will be done 'working on it' - it's been over 10 years.  \n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694911609, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16kn673/aita_for_wanting_my_mentally_ill_stepdaughter_to/", "score": 421, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like her issues are fairly severe. Therapy alone can\u2019t help everyone especially someone with past depressive issues. Have any of her therapists suggested medication because if not, I would be very surprised. A few years ago, at my very first visit with a therapist, she suggested anxiety medication and I\u2019m a very functional person, I just had really bad sleep issues.", "NAH just a young adult with a mental health problem that she isn't managing well enough to function as an adult, and a stepparent who has reason to believe she's malingering.\n\nI do question why, after so many years, she doesn't have an official diagnosis from a psychiatrist or someone else qualified to do it. If she is truly unable to work, she will need disability income in case you're hit by a bus one day. Clearly she needs more structure than the average person, yet that doesn't mean you are obligated to provide it for her well into adulthood. You married her mom, not her.\n\nGiven that she's not in crisis I'd say you have done your moral duty and need not be held hostage to her self-sabotaging behavior. That being said, you need an exit strategy because the current situation isn't going to serve her long-term. Start by getting her an appointment with a real shrink, to help provide her with either a disability income or a path to independent life.", "NAH. Could she work on an online degree? That would open up her potential for job opportunities that include working from home.", "I don\u2019t know if YTA, but considering she failed college because she couldn\u2019t go outside, it sounds like the real issue is you just don\u2019t think she\u2019s actually as ill as she, your wife, and her therapist say she is", "when i read the title i was expecting something big. Like shes abusing your kindness or demanding expensive things and not going to therapy ans not trying to get any jobw or anything. That she didnt care\n\nall i got? Oh its more food and **affordable** clothing. SHe does therwpy. She tried college, she keeps trying jobs. She feels so guilty over this. She Wants to move out. She doesnt want to feel like a god damn burden to you.\n\nYTA. just because its not visable doesnt make it any less a disability. You keep treating her like she is just a burden rather then your kid. Like what the f?:", "> Kat's disorder is not very visible. She's very introverted and dislikes family gatherings, prefers staying at home over doing any activity and even going on vacation with us, \n\nThats pretty fucking visible dude, thats what social anxiety is.\n\nIt sounds like she's barely functioning as it is. \n\nYTA.", "She needs smaller goals to work on, not you kicking her out.\n\nCommunity college? Volunteering somewhere with her mom at the same time? Weekly visits to stores. Responsibilities at home like grocery shopping online or housework?", "Yep, YTA. She is barely holding by the thread not to unalive herself, and your reaction is \"Oh, it's all in your head, you are just lazy\"? Because that's how it sounds. Her disability is very real, and she is actively working on managing it. You are basically just suggesting abandoning her because she is \"defective\".", "YTA majorly\n\nI can absolutely guarantee that this is 10000x worse for her to experience than you to \"wait\" on. Mental health struggles can be completely debilitating, and just because people are able to mask their symptoms, doesn't mean they aren't real. If you have a broken rib but you're wearing a shirt, that doesn't mean that you're overreacting to the pain just because no one can see it. Visibility does not equal validity. I highly recommend that you have meetings with her therapist/group sessions as a family because otherwise it will be impossible for you to truly understand what is going on.\n\nIf you force her out on her own when she needs support, you may as well say you'd rather pay funeral expenses than her food costs. YTA\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI seriously don't understand how people are looking at someone who, by OP's admission, is too anxious to even do fun things, won't go on vacations, says they want to move out as well, and thinks \"ah yes, this is someone running a scam for food and clothing\" ?? Like what in the world.   \nALSO: having done things historically doesn't mean she's not ill. Like you can be high functioning and push through periods of time where you do things like graduate high school or start uni, but mental health flares up. It's like having an autoimmune disease or any other type of illness. \n\n* **\"Your don't really have arthritis, you were using your phone fine earlier\"**\n* **\"Sorry Jerry, you weren't in debilitating pain last week, how could you be having an MS flare up now? Are you faking your disease so you can eat?\"** \n* **\"you weren't diabetic when your blood sugar was in balance\"** \n* **\"oh what's that? Chemo was working for a while but you've had new cell growth? Will you ever stop using your cancer to get out of things? Stop being lazy\"** \n\nIllness is illness for god's sake.", "Going to university obviously caused too much anxiety for Kat.  She can still get a college education through community college.  Encourage her to try one or two classes to begin.  It\u2019s a step toward employment.  I also recommend vocational rehabilitation.", "NTA she, of course, needs to grow and become independent. Even with an anxiety disorder, she needs to face the world. Sounds like she is milking in. She cannot hide.", "YTA.\n\nAs someone who went through something very similar to your stepdaughter at that age, I'm going to ask you, for just a second, to think about how *she* feels. I want you to imagine what it's like to be afraid to leave your house, to be an adult but completely reliant on other people, and to be so young but feel like this terror (that likely still exists every waking moment for her and is just less when she stays home) and reliance on others is all she has to look forward to for the next sixty-odd years of her life. Imagine what it would be like to be so completely isolated from other people. Imagine what it would feel like, at the time you're supposed to be young and stupid and carefree and having fun, to struggle even to walk down the street without having panic attacks, let alone make friends, date, or hold regular employment. How much of a failure you would feel like. How demoralizing that would be.\n\nIf it were you in your stepdaughter's shoes, would tough love make you less afraid? Would being kicked out do anything to help? Because as someone who went through good phases and bad phases as a kid I want to be clear - I never \"lived with it\" or \"managed it\". There were times through happenstance I would get a few months or even a year's break, but it would always come back, and I was always in a state of hyper-vigilance against it. I spent my entire childhood the way most kids who are aware they have something wrong with their brain do: living in fear that I couldn't tell any adults in my life exactly how bad it was or I'd be sent away, locked up, or have any semblance of normalcy and love taken from me. I did not get breaks from it. I did not get vacations where I got to feel \"normal\" or relax. Whatever you think she's experiencing, however hard it is for you to live in proximity to it, in her head I can promise you it feels a hundred times worse than anything you can imagine.\n\nYour stepdaughter is seriously ill. It is an invisible illness, it is a treatable illness, but it is a chronic and debilitating illness. You do not stop being a parent when someone turns 18, and you especially don't when that young adult is still suffering with an illness that traps them in a state of reliance on you. She needs therapy (I would suggest CBT therapy) and better medication. She needs to be checked for underlying issues (lots of common mental illnesses like ADHD, depression, sensory processing issues, being somewhere on the autism spectrum, OCD, etc etc etc piggyback or co-exist with anxiety, and managing anxiety gets even more difficult if these aren't identified and also treated), and she needs you and her mother to encourage her to slowly, one step at a time and under the advice of a professional, become exposed to the world around her so she can manage to find her way through it. You need to help her figure out remote work or things she can do from home. You need to above all else *listen to how she feels and not act like it's a moral failure to have these feelings*. She has been alone with these feelings for her entire life, trapped in the terror that letting you or her mother know how bad it is will cause you to reject her, to the point where as a *middle schooler* she thought it would be easier for everyone if she just died. She is no more in control of what her body and brain are putting her through than someone is in control of if they do or don't have allergic reactions. You right now are not only making your stepdaughter feel like crap by confirming all her worst fears, you're making your wife feel like crap or that she \"owes\" you in some way, and you are both treating this poor girl like she's a burden and not what she is, which is someone who is very young and very sick and who has done nothing wrong but need help from her parents.  \n\n\nEdit: I should add - I am now in my mid-thirties, my symptoms are almost entirely managed and have been for about 10 years, and I have a stable, 40-hour a week job that I'm really happy at. I'm lucky enough to say this both because I worked extremely hard to get better and because my parents supported me every step of the way. There is a very real light at the end of this tunnel, but none of you are going to get to it by saying \"well, kiddo, you're legally an adult now so figure it out I guess\" and just hoping for the best.", "NTA. Why should you have to support her?", "YTA  \nYou're not a clinical psychiatrist, I assume? You are very dismissive of her condition, but -- forgive me -- you probably don't really understand the first thing about it. There are thousands of people who commit suicide due to problems such as these every year.   \n\n\nYes, there are people who only pretend or use their relatively mild condition as a pretext, but that's what expert opinion is for. If they say she has it, you shouldn't doubt it. Getting a second opinion is the only sensible thing if you have real doubts based on facts -- which you haven't.   \n\n\nIf you want to help her build a way forward and alleviate the situation at home, try to support her to find to do something she can do from home. There are hundreds of jobs you can do via PC. She can also get a degree online.   \n\n\nBut telling her to 'man up' is just you beint TA.", ">\"She doesn't have to do this; I make enough money for all three of us...\"  \n>  \n>\"... it would be better if Kat just worked and moved out\"\n\nI've never been diagnosed since my parents were against me seeking therapy at 14, but I *definitely* had social anxiety. There are some things in your story that stick out to me.\n\nYou say she's very introverted, disliked family gatherings and prefers to stay home. It \"never seemed like a huge issue\" since she graduated just fine, but she wanted to *DIE* at 14. Do you not consider this a huge issue?!\n\n>\"After so many years of being in and out of therapy for something that she has always lived/managed with, I can't help but feel like she has just weaponized it to not have to work.\"\n\nHave you ever heard of the DSM-5? Every therapist has to follow this manual *to the letter* to ensure that a patient meets a disorder's specific requirements before they can get an official diagnosis.\n\n>*\"E.  The avoidance, anxious anticipation, or distress in the feared social or performance situation(s)* ***interferes significantly*** *with the person's normal routine, occupational (academic) functioning, or social activities or relationships, or there is marked distress about having the phobia.\"*\n\nOne criterion that lays grounds for just about *every* disorder is that it has to interfere with one's life. You said Kat has severe social anxiety disorder. To be frank: if she was able to live life like any regular person, she wouldn't have had social anxiety disorder.\n\nPersonally, I have ADHD. People sometimes tell me to \"just\" do what I should do. *Just* sit down and focus; *just* don't get distracted. If I *could*, I wouldn't have ADHD. If a blind person could see, they wouldn't be blind.\n\nKat needs help. You want to throw her out to teach her independence, but that won't work. Some people are scared of the world and when even those who loved them don't want them anymore, then that must mean there really *is* no hope.\n\n>It never seemed like a huge issue  \nShe specifies her disorder in every job application. I believe this is a stupid idea  \nI think Kat knows this as well, and does it on purpose.  \nI can't help but feel like she has just weaponized it  \nI think it would be better if Kat just worked and moved out\n\nYou think a lot but seem to *know* very little...\n\n>but that aside she's normal.  \nShe can hold a conversation fine  \nit's become a problem ever since said graduation.  \nshe doesn't outwardly show that she has a disorder\n\nWhat is she like in social settings where she doesn't know anyone? Does she start conversations? Is she open to them? How does she behave?\n\nMy social anxiety would sometimes make me so sick, I'd throw up. School lunches were spent on the toilet or walking around the building, pretending I had somewhere to be. I didn't. My online friends were easier to talk to because I felt like they wouldn't judge me as much. I didn't know what to say when I was put on the spot in face-to-face conversation.\n\nYou don't know everything about Kat. You don't know everything about her disorder. You don't know what she's going through yet think you know the answer. If the answer was that simple, psychologists and therapists wouldn't exist. You are *not* qualified.  \n\n\nEdit: Obvious YTA.", "NAH I have empathy as someone who has anxiety, general and social, has panic attacks, and has experienced depression. I have never been suicidal though so I can\u2019t provide insight on how that deepens those feelings. It can feel like the world is ending and it\u2019s a crushing overwhelming experience sometimes. \n\nI\u2019ve skipped a lot of classes in college due to anxiety or depression and I\u2019ve lost a lot of sleep which caused me to be less attentive in the classes I did attend or sleep through them. But I never skipped any high school classes because I couldn\u2019t without getting in trouble, I didn\u2019t skip any of my thesis classes because I would have had steep repercussions. \n\nI did extend my graduation due to depression, I couldn\u2019t finish my thesis on time (mostly independent study so I didn\u2019t have as much structured accountability). But I knew I\u2019d still be able to graduate and keep my scholarships even if I extended so it was only my pride that hurt. My professor was incredibly understanding after I broke down in his office and extended my deadline, asked me how often I wanted him to check in with me without overwhelming me, and said take your time I know you will get there. That was life changing empathy. I graduated the next semester. I just needed some space. \n\nAlso for one class I did skip many many times in the depth of my depression even tho the syllabus said I\u2019d fail cause at point I gave up and I didn\u2019t care. This is where I see empathy, because kat might be at that point. My professor gave me an A at the end, I didn\u2019t have consequences. To be fair I did great on tests and projects and participated wholeheartedly when I was there, which I could tell she appreciated. But I easily could have experienced justified grade lowering due to my attendance and it would have been my fault.  but I\u2019ve always been a hard worker, I just couldn\u2019t do it at that state of mind, I was sick. \n\nI always showed up to work because I needed to eat and pay rent. I flake on friends because I feel like shit but I knew they would forgive me, I have intense physical symptoms when I have to do anything performative, but I\u2019ve mustered up to do many things that were nevcesary and important and it\u2019s made me soooo much better in recent years. I\u2019ve never had therapy but I know I\u2019d benefit even more if I did that. I don\u2019t like the \u201cI had it tough so you should too\u201d mentality but there\u2019s also the concept of requiring someone to do everything they are capable of doing. People with mental illness can\npull it out of their pocket if they are required to. I don\u2019t think infantilizing someone will enable them to make progress. I also believe empathy and patience is required. I always knew my parents would welcome me with open arms if I truly couldn\u2019t handle it. I made myself sick but I never got to the point where I wanted to die, so I stuck it out alone to prove I could do it. In my case it worked out and helped me become an independent strong person, but I can also very clearly see the other side of the paper. It\u2019s a toughie for me", "Me F56, have a daughter 25, in a similar situation. With her approval, that is important, I got her a flat so she can be more independent of me. I help her financially and of course psychologically. I am always there if she needs me. Being on her own and facing some of her issues by herself is making her grow. She also feels very proud being able to manage her life to some degree. Should she want to move back home, I would support that too. But right now I believe her being more independent was a positive move. NAH", "Maybe she needs to be reassessed. I was diagnosed with anxiety as a teen and personally did not find my therapy helpful but since adulthood and getting my daughter diagnosed as AuDHD I've found my anxiety diagnosis was incorrect (it was a symptom, not a full diagnosis) and I am also on the spectrum. It's made some things a lot easier as well as understanding myself. I don't feel as much a failure at life, but also if I'd been diagnosed properly earlier I would have received better/more appropriate therapies that would have helped. \n\nIf she is indeed Autistic she may benefit from supports in school or the workplace. I think these things are becoming more commonplace.", "NTA. I have fairly severe social anxiety and ADHD. I know for certain for me, and my kids, if I don\u2019t HAVE to do something, I won\u2019t do it. She has an infinite cushion right now; it\u2019s one thing to be a safety net, and another to be a perpetual enabler. Have a talk with your wife first and then with wife and SD- propose that you want to HELP her find her footing. Propose a move out date 6 months out. Ideally with roommates, not alone. Help her find a job that would offer her room for personal growth AND fulfillment. I swear, the validation that comes from doing a job I love motivated me so much. She\u2019ll have 6 months to save for independent living. If things don\u2019t work? She can come home, but the expectation is that she\u2019ll work 15 hours a week and pay rent or something. There HAS to be an expectation of her or she will have none for herself. This is not me being judgmental\u2014 this is my own life lessons from my own anxiety/depression.", "These comments are a little wild to be honest. I have three very very major mental health disabilities. I\u2019ve gone through times in my life when I couldn\u2019t get out of bed for work, when I couldn\u2019t drive myself, whatever. Believe me when I say that I completely understand and sympathize with Kat. \n\nThat said, NAH, and certainty not OP. Two things can be true at once. Kat can have a very real and very difficult disability, and at the same time be using it as an excuse to not have to make progress in her life. A disability is not a life sentence to a room in her parents house, and therapy alone is almost never the whole answer. Services such as vocational rehabilitation, work and school accommodations, and disability benefits can help her to set and meet some goals. Sitting in her room indefinitely (her parents won\u2019t live forever) is not treatment, nor is it a solution to the issue. \n\nOP, you would be the AH if you wanted to kick her out today. It seems like you are more interested in seeing some progress with her independence. That\u2019s not unreasonable and I don\u2019t know why these comments are pretending it is honestly. It\u2019s not in Kat\u2019s interest to continue as she is either. I know how much easier and more comfortable it would be to just say \u201cthis is how it is, nothing I can do\u201d, and I understand the temptation. It\u2019s difficult and scary to pursue treatment, but it sounds like Kat wants more than her current situation as well, and it\u2019s good to set some goals and pursue some options. Social anxiety is hard, but treatable and manageable. She\u2019s not currently doing that, and a small amount of pressure to do so, with professional guidance and support, is a good first step.", "YTA\n\nThe reality is that \u2018working on it\u2019 doesn\u2019t guarantee a particular outcome. Chronic illnesses persist. That\u2019s what they do.

I got married 4 times as a means of support and, hopefully, stability. Not to people I would have chosen to marry had I been independent and able to support myself. Had I had a healthy, understanding family that I could have stayed with, my life would have been much better. You have a child with a disability. You need to take care of her. With a lot of support, she may be able to attend online college and eventually get a WFH job. Or she may have to go on disability. Trust me, she will not land on her feet if you kick her out because she CAN'T, not because she's lazy.", "NAH I think you just don't understand her mental illness fully. But I also think that she should have a goal of at least getting a part-time job doing something outside of the house. Because staying in is never going to help her. But I can understand that it does feel like going outside is the end of the world it feels like you're dying stepping out of the door. Or sometimes it's just plain paralyzing you're actually feeling anything but you're just paralyzed. It's like you can't make a choice you can't decide to go out the door. So you lose your job. You lose your therapist. You lose friends. \n\nI think she needs more support. It could be small things like you offering to take her for a walk. You guys can drive to a wooded path or something and just go for a walk away from people. That used to help me sometimes. \nBut overall a professional is what's best. You guys helping her maintain her therapist and even potentially medication will be most important in the long run.", "Can she work from. Home? People are kess intimidating behind a screen and or phone.", "Can she not go on government benefits like long term disability if she is diagnosed?", "NTA-Kat doesn\u2019t to be mollycoddled, she needs a harsh reality check. I call bs on the social anxiety and if it is real, the only way she is going to get over it is by interacting with people. Now, I think it\u2019s all too easy to use the excuse of anxiety for selfish behaviour. I wonder if her \u2018social anxiety\u2019 would affect her so much if she didn\u2019t have a roof over her head and lots of food. Kat is lazy and she is a leech on you-I would offer to get her treatment but at the same time give her a deadline to get a job and if she doesn\u2019t have one, she needs to move out.", "YTA. I have diagnosed social anxiety disorder and it very much is debilitating. Without medication, I cannot talk to anyone outside of my family. I cannot leave my apartment to even buy groceries because the thought of being around strangers causes so much panic I cannot breathe. Thankfully, I am on medicine. But I\u2019d be just like your stepdaughter if I weren\u2019t. \n\nAnd yes, at one point, I did have to go on disability because of my social anxiety disorder as it prevented me from being able to leave my apartment to go to work. The amount was not enough to live on, and if I wasn\u2019t staying with my mom I would have been homeless. Disability barely was enough for me to eat (and I wouldn\u2019t have eaten if my mom wasn\u2019t kind enough to get groceries for me as I couldn\u2019t leave the apartment).\n\nFrom my experience, social anxiety is the worst in the mid twenties as a woman because our bodies go through hormone changes that exasperate the condition. Anxiety is caused by specific hormones and chemicals in the brain. It\u2019s a disorder when the brain produces too much all the time. Hormone changes mess that up further. I was on meds since I was a teenager, but because of my hormones changing, they stopped working for a year. That\u2019s a year of my life I lost. Thankfully doctors found a new combination that worked, but again it took a year. And not everyone responds to medication the same way. I\u2019m lucky that my parents have a medication history doctors can use to better guess which prescriptions will work. Your stepdaughter does not have that.\n\nLong story short, your stepdaughter very much does have a disability whether you believe it or not. Kicking her out will only make her homeless or dead. What you should do is wait as the professionals do their job to help your stepdaughter. It takes time to find the right treatment let alone for it to actually work.

The poor girl is doing her best to function in a society that doesn\u2019t always have the best supports for such disorders.\n\nShe might need to speak with a psychiatrist to get on medications. And she might benefit from trying to find a stay at home or remote job. Or perhaps something that doesn\u2019t require her to be around people much. Maybe a food delivery job? Or some freelance work of some kind?\n\nStill if the disorder is preventing her from being able to work maybe she can get disability, and if so then get someone to help her through the process.\n\nKudos to your wife for so willingly supporting her daughter.

I agree that something needs to change here, but you have to remember that she has a severe mental illness which is a disability.

Your stepdaughter\u2019s disability might not be very obvious *to you* in normal conversation, because she has lived with you since she was a kid and presumably is comfortable with you. Except that it clearly is obvious to you - all of the things you\u2019re describing, dropping out of college, relapsing, having a legitimate diagnosis, suicidality, not finding work that suits - are impacts of her disability on her life. That said, yes, declaring it upfront is probably stopping her from getting a chance with places and might be a self-defence mechanism.

I know a young person who couldn\u2019t finish school due to the severity of their anxiety disorder. They worked with an occupational therapist to get an interview in an international retail store (Primark in case there\u2019s one near you) - the therapist coached her through the interview, was able to attend to interview, went to work with her the first while, and coached her through issues that arose that triggered the anxiety. Now, that person works there on their own, is getting great feedback, is making progress in handling issues that come up by themselves, and is hoping to receive an offer of a permanent job after Christmas. The store has a programme specifically to work with disabled people - I think a lot of the big chains have something like that in place. It pays the same as any other job this kid would have gotten, and has great career options for the future if they decided to stay.

I don\u2019t know what kind of work she is putting in to work on her social anxiety with the therapist either but saying that if she isn\u2019t working than she needs to structure a way to work on her self towards getting better. E.g., since she\u2019s living with you guys and don\u2019t have a job, she could have exposure therapy for herself as her job, go for a walk in the morning, going to the shop for you guys, taking the bus to a city center as if going to work. Avoiding uncomfortable situations is an evil circle it\u2019s very hard to get out of and making sure every day contains exposure is a lot more helpful than moving from sitting inside gaming in one place to another.

Work from home jobs, disability, a psychiatrist, medication, maybe a new therapist, online college, etcetc. She sounds like she wants to get better but it\u2019s hard when your head tells you otherwise.\n\nThe brain is an organ that needs tending to too. You don\u2019t tell someone who broke their leg to just walk it off. A person with mental illness can\u2019t just get over it in the same way.\n\nI suggest you try therapy as well.

Food, shelter, basic clothes and necessities, and internet for study and job hunt will be there. Fancier clothes, internet for leisure and money to spend on hobbies/non-essentials will be conditional to her going to therapy and being open to why a certain therapist doesn't work for her (there are many therapy methods and finding a therapist that works can be hard, so her benefits shouldn't be suspended as long as she is trying and being honest). Yes, this is treating her like a child, but transitioning into adulthood without a mental illness is hard enough as it is.

My stepdaughter Kat (24) does not work and lives with us. I work full time, my wife sometimes part time.\r  \nKat suffers from severe social anxiety, and has written a note to her mother about not wanting to live anymore when she was only 14; reason being that she was too afraid to go to school. She's been through three therapists since and has been with the fourth for over a year now. She would leave therapy for a while, then 'relapse' and return a few months/years later. \r  \n\r  \nThis might sound callous, but even though she has been officially diagnosed, Kat's disorder is not very visible. She's very introverted and dislikes family gatherings, prefers staying at home over doing any activity and even going on vacation with us, but that aside she's normal. She can hold a conversation fine, and has plenty of online friends that she talks to daily. It never seemed like a huge issue, as she did graduate just fine, but it's become a problem ever since said graduation.  \n\r  \nKat went to university and even moved out to do so for a year, but came back home after not attending classes after the first month and then obviously failing them. She claims it was because classes were too difficult to keep up with while also having to be among people all day, so she stopped going and shut herself in her dorm room.   \nI know she's not stupid, but she is also not very ambitious. This is another problem, as she has had severe difficulty finding work after she's come home. She worked for a few weeks after we found her a job working in a school kitchen, but was fired. Her work ethic as a whole was reportedly okay - again, not stupid, just little effort.   \nSince then, she's applied to very few jobs and gotten no interviews. She specifies her disorder in every job application. I believe this is a stupid idea, as employers would probably skip over any applicants that have issues from the get go, especially because she doesn't outwardly show that she has a disorder anyway. I think Kat knows this as well, and does it on purpose.\r  \n\r  \nAfter so many years of being in and out of therapy for something that she has always lived/managed with, I can't help but feel like she has just weaponized it to not have to work.   \nMy wife supports her daughter fully, and has even taken on to working herself so that she doesn't feel guilty about me supporting her daughter. She doesn't have to do this; I make enough money for all three of us and Kat doesn't cause any expenses beyond food and affordable clothing. Kat feels guilty in turn because of this, but nothing has changed with her behavior.   \nI think it would be better if Kat just worked and moved out to learn some independence. My wife thinks this would only make Kat miserable and that we should support her since she is 'working on it' in therapy. I don't know how long we have to wait until Kat will be done 'working on it' - it's been over 10 years.  \n\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The program directors insisted I go to a therapist. I had been dating a girl and the relationship ending, why and how it ended was why I was at the therapist. During the first session the therapist kept insisting that I had NOT been in a lesbian relationship but that my ex and I had just been good friends.

Autistic people are not all the same, you should know. Idk what therapists the OP's stepdaughter has been going to, but just any therapist isn't going to have the right qualifications to disgnose autism in women.\n\nEven if it is \"just\" social anxiety, it is still clearly a disability.

And yet not one single one of them caught that I was autistic, though now everyone is like \u201coh yeah I see it.

She needs an aggressive psych + therapy treatment plan that is regularly managed.  \n\n\nI think the point is really to help her get started on a strategy to slowly build her independence.

If she handles it well, increase the stimuli. \n\nNo one is saying she should stay like this forever doing nothing. The point is to help her help herself.
