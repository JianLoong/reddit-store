I loved my cat so, so, so very much. He was there for me through everything I in my life, and had a long healthy future ahead of him.\n\nMonths ago, Mary, my boyfriend's mother, came to me and asked to borrow my car for a road trip and a concert she and her BF wanted to go to.  Now, I was reluctant because thr last time she borrowed a car from me, she puncture a tire and somehow completely destroyed thr brakes. (She also gave me 0 explanation). \n\nBut she begged, BEGGED to take the car. She promised to pay $200, or cost to fix if she damaged anything or made a mess, and that she and her bf wouldn't do anything \"unsavory\" or \"illegal\" (she rolled her eyes while saying this as though i was being stupid).\n\nI finally relented, with thr condition that if anything went wrong she would be financially accountable, and that she would have my car back to me in three days, as i would need it for work. I gave her the keys and told her to pick up rhe car from my place in the morning, as I would be sleeping in. \n\nThe next morning at 8am, I wake up, confused that my cat hadn't yet started bugging me for food. However, I didn't think too much of it until I stepped out onto my front porch. My precious baby was laying there, mangled, in the driveway!\n\nI completely broke down, calling my bf and sobbing. I was so confused; I don't even let my cat outside! I said this to my bf, who got quiet and said he'd call me back in a minute.\n\nTurns out, Mary had decided she was hungry and, using the spare house key on my car keys, had let herself in and left the door open! Then, because it was dark, she had backed over my cat without noticing. My bf called me back and told me this. I was heartbroken, and angry. I called and demanded that they turn around and return my car, but his mom hung up and refused to answer calls and texts after that. \n\nAfter they returned, three days later, I told Mary that she was never, EVER going to borrow anything of mine again. She rolled her eyes. Later, I opened my car door and saw they had completely trashed it. Food, soda, BEER, and cigarette ash were spilled all over the front and back seat. I asked Mary to either clean the car or pay up. She refused. \n\nYesterday, Mary called, hysterically crying over her father's health. Doctors are giving him two weeks, and mary doesn't have a car. (My bf is out of town for work and she cannot use his) she asked me if she could please borrow my car, just for an 8 hour trip. \n\nI said no. And I didn't care.  She screamed I was a c*** and heartless. She said her own father could pass away without being able to say goodbye. And I casually suggested a zoom call. She, understandably, didn't take it well.\n\nLater, my bf and her husband tried to get me to change my mind but I haven't. Every time I start feeling guilty, i replay it all in my mind and get angry about my cat all over again.

Never, ever, ever, loan or give anything to your bf\u2019s mother again.", "She can\u2019t rent a car because of the last time she rented a car she returned it in poor condition. If her driving to say goodbye to her dad, is so important, she can borrow her sons car and he can rent one to use for work.\n\nNTA\nEdit: add to comment", "NTA. She killed your cat. She took away your ability to ever see it again, and she lost the privilege of your kindness. \n\nShe can catch a bus.", "NTA. I hate what it cost you to see that you cannot give in to her relentless demands, abuse of what you hold dear/value/worked hard for, and her empty promises. If your BF is not willing to say 'no' to his mom or uphold boundaries, or cut her off if necessary; you may want to rethink tying your life to his, when she is part of his ongoing baggage.", "Most definitely NTA and she sounds like a real treat to be around! These are the consequences of her own actions though! She\u2019s ridiculously entitled and doesn\u2019t respect you or your car! And how you bf thinks that your wrong after she has trashed you car twice, did pay to have fixed or cleaned or clean it herself, snuck in your house to eat your food, left your cat out and then killed the poor baby, not even apologizing and bring your car back like you told her told  (I personally would of reported it stolen!) is mind blowing.!!! You\u2019re not stopping her from seeing her dying father your just putting you foot down, creating a very much deserved boundary and not letting her take advantage of you! I wouldn\u2019t help this woman out with anything ever again!! So sorry about your baby!", "[deleted]", "Can she though? She sounds like the kind of person who doesn't keep a valid credit card or a clean driving record. \n\nPerhaps BF could rent one for her, and take personal responsibility for his mother's behavior.", "Maybe she can't. Does she even have a license? Just more risk for OP. Sounds like a her problem and if the boyfriend wants to get involved it's his problem. Not hers.", "\"You owe her nothing but your silence.\"\n\nThis part. Do it. Say nothing and go on with your life.", "All of this. But OP also has a boyfriend problem, because after all this, he's still supporting her and pressuring OP to give her the car. The fact that he got quiet after OP's cat got killed means he knew it was her. She's done stuff like this before, and the people around her have simply enabled it.\n\nOP, you need to change all your locks. And maybe don't give bf a key, either. NTA.", "Also, given her history, I\u2019m expecting that her father will make a miraculous recovery and she\u2019ll be driving off to god knows where while blocking OP\u2019s phone calls", "None of this is your problem. Don't give her any more chances to destroy things that are important to you. Cut her out of your life.", "Nta I'm a very plus sized women and I was on a bus for almost 12 hrs one way just for a fun trip. She obviously doesn't care for her dad enough if that's what's stopping her. If she calls again maybe suggest plane. Otherwise tell her to fuck off", "Why can't MIL's husband drive her or help her get to her dad?", "Do not ever co-sign anything for her again.  It\u2019s not your problem to figure out how she gets there.   She\u2019s lost your trust.  It\u2019s fair to tell her no given all of the context.  She can gaslight and project on you all she wants for her own failure to be trustworthy enough be worthy of lending or renting a car.  I\u2019m so sorry this woman is in your life.", "Yeah so all of this, \u201cI don\u2019t have a car\u201d,  is her doing. She\u2019s reaping what she sows. She\u2019s sounds like a real piece of work. NTA.", "I would say that it's not your problem to solve. She is a grown woman with a transportation issue. She burned the bridge that connected her to you for help solving this type of problem. I wouldn't take her calls any more during this crisis of hers. I would also tell my boyfriend in no uncertain terms that he needs to support my decision, which is clearly backed by a history with his mother.\n\nIf boyfriend's mother wanted to maintain an open line of communication for transportation assistance, then she shouldn't have been such as asshole the previous times you helped her out. You are NTA. You are just refusing to let an ungrateful, lying, disrespectful asshole take advantage of you.", "Why didn\u2019t you file a police report against her when she ran over your cat? Surely her actions need to be met with heavily punitive consequences?", "NTA\n\nDon't ask her about options. It's her job to figure out how to get there, not your job to figure out her options for her. That's just going to make her think you're still considering lending your car.\n\nAlso - if her credit is to bad that she can't rent a car, or she's banned from car rental places, then obviously she's not trustworthy. As many problems there are with the US Credit score system, it's often pretty accurate.", "As a larger woman, If the bus seats are uncomfortable... and my FATHER IS DYING\n\nI am taking that bus. \n\nI am very sorry about Puddin'. I am glad your bf got your something to remember your kitty by.   \n\n\nKeep your boundaries, she doesnt deserve anything from you anymore. (never did in the first place but even less so now)", "You don't need credit to rent a car so don't lie about that. You don't even need a credit card anymore to rent one.", "Dude. Respect yourself. Never talk to her again. Dump your boyfriend. Call the cops. Sue her. There is literally no reason to every deal or spend time with these shit people.", "Same actually, but omfg. Someone send help.", " in what universe??", "Did you read the post? The title is a bit inflammatory.", "I love my boyfriend but if my mother in law (or anyone) killed my cat I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be able to get over it. What the hell is wrong with her??\n\nOP, I am so sorry for your loss.", "I normally don\u2019t got for this option, but he\u2019s not doing anything to deter this insane woman from all of her shenanigans and frankly what kind of future do they have as a couple? That\u2019s one MIL I definitely wouldn\u2019t want!", "Even if she can\u2019t it isn\u2019t OPs problem. Like you said BF can sort something out. It\u2019s his mother after all.", "Yeah there are lots of options here \u2014 car rental, Greyhound, plane, road trip with other family members, etc etc etc. But dysfunctional mom wants to pretend that using OP\u2019s car is the only option on earth because she\u2019s manipulative and narcissistic.", "This was my thought. The BF obviously enables his highly dysfunctional mother. Someone\u2019s likely middle aged mother should not be begging to borrow a car, trashing said car, et et.  If the bf won\u2019t support OP in going no contact with his mother I\u2019d suggest that she\u2019d be better off leaving the relationship.", "Yeah, I was thinking there's a reason she can't rent a car and nobody else is willing to lend her theirs. I'm not surprised at all. So bus it is, or nothing.", "You do if your bank account doesn't have enough for their $200 or w/e deposit. She doesn't have any $  so no debit card option.", "Why can't her husband rent a car?", "I would be screaming at the top of my lungs for years at this person if she killed my cat - let alone everything else. I\u2019d never stop screaming. Honestly I\u2019d  probably end up in jail because I would physically attack her. NTA.", "This woman would use you up until you all ended up on the street if you'd let her. She is an unimaginably shitty entitled person. You have to set this boundary and refuse to hear of it again. NTA", "And people in hell want ice water.", "Thought so too but didn't want to sound rude so kept it out of the comment.", "[removed]", "I can only hope his suffering was short. May he reach the Rainbow Bridge.", "Haha thank you! \ud83e\udde1", "You\u2019re not over reacting AT ALL.  A grown woman should not be begging to borrow your car.. Never mind trashing your car.  And killing your cat with zero remorse?? Your bf too is obviously enabling his mothers behavior.  He should not be allowing his mother around you. Instead he\u2019s telling you to give her another chance with the car. This situation is not going to get any better.", "[deleted]", "When I was in the states they let me use a debit card.\n\nAlthough they said at the 3rd time that they shouldn't be doing it because I was foreign - but they let me do it once again because I mentioned how they'd let me do so twice already.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

In 2022, a credit card is required for a US citizen to rent a car from any major company.", "\nBut if you don't have enough $ for a down payment, you can't really ... well, make the down payment without a credit card. Which she doesn't have. ):\nI also helped her rent a car before and she returned it in subpar condition, so the place in her town has actually blacklisted us BOTH.", "Interesting. With enterprise back in 2014/15 I was told that anyone with a US license could use a debit card, but people on foreign licenses had to use a credit card."]}
