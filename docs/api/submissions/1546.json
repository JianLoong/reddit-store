I loved my cat so, so, so very much. He was there for me through everything I in my life, and had a long healthy future ahead of him.\n\nMonths ago, Mary, my boyfriend's mother, came to me and asked to borrow my car for a road trip and a concert she and her BF wanted to go to.  Now, I was reluctant because thr last time she borrowed a car from me, she puncture a tire and somehow completely destroyed thr brakes. (She also gave me 0 explanation). \n\nBut she begged, BEGGED to take the car. She promised to pay $200, or cost to fix if she damaged anything or made a mess, and that she and her bf wouldn't do anything \"unsavory\" or \"illegal\" (she rolled her eyes while saying this as though i was being stupid).\n\nI finally relented, with thr condition that if anything went wrong she would be financially accountable, and that she would have my car back to me in three days, as i would need it for work. I gave her the keys and told her to pick up rhe car from my place in the morning, as I would be sleeping in. \n\nThe next morning at 8am, I wake up, confused that my cat hadn't yet started bugging me for food. However, I didn't think too much of it until I stepped out onto my front porch. My precious baby was laying there, mangled, in the driveway!\n\nI completely broke down, calling my bf and sobbing. I was so confused; I don't even let my cat outside! I said this to my bf, who got quiet and said he'd call me back in a minute.\n\nTurns out, Mary had decided she was hungry and, using the spare house key on my car keys, had let herself in and left the door open! Then, because it was dark, she had backed over my cat without noticing. My bf called me back and told me this. I was heartbroken, and angry. I called and demanded that they turn around and return my car, but his mom hung up and refused to answer calls and texts after that. \n\nAfter they returned, three days later, I told Mary that she was never, EVER going to borrow anything of mine again. She rolled her eyes. Later, I opened my car door and saw they had completely trashed it. Food, soda, BEER, and cigarette ash were spilled all over the front and back seat. I asked Mary to either clean the car or pay up. She refused. \n\nYesterday, Mary called, hysterically crying over her father's health. Doctors are giving him two weeks, and mary doesn't have a car. (My bf is out of town for work and she cannot use his) she asked me if she could please borrow my car, just for an 8 hour trip. \n\nI said no. And I didn't care.  She screamed I was a c*** and heartless. She said her own father could pass away without being able to say goodbye. And I casually suggested a zoom call. She, understandably, didn't take it well.\n\nLater, my bf and her husband tried to get me to change my mind but I haven't. Every time I start feeling guilty, i replay it all in my mind and get angry about my cat all over again.

Him apologizing for her behavior is him trying to keep the door open to let her back inside after she murdered your pet and stole your car. \n\nIf he actually wanted to make this right and actually had any intention of kicking her out of his life, he wouldn't be apologizing for her. You're going to keep dealing with the woman who murdered your cat if you stay with this guy", "I mean the only way she can assure that is getting rid of the guy who keeps letting her back into their life. They should no longer have a life together since he is choosing his thieving mother over keeping her safe, and now her cat has been killed because of it", "This! OPs car isn't the only option. She could take a bus as well. So many other options.", "Not with me on the jury you wouldn\u2019t have!!! I gotchu.", "Heck, she could walk that far in two weeks.", "Right?! Like damn I am at work rn and I can't leave but I want to because I just want to snuggle my own kitty baby rn after reading that. Also I would not be surprised if she killed the cat on purpose", "Exactly that. I'm trying to imagine myself in this situation but prison just keeps popping up. Idk how she's still able to ask for the car. Like breathing and stuff lol", "His mom is the bigger TA. The apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree.", "What do you want to bet that she doesn't have a valid license and *can't* rent a car.", "Agreed with the NTA. \n\nIf my partner\u2019s parent borrowed my car and killed my pet with no remorse I would be in prison, with him defending my actions.\n\nMary is the type of person who wouldn\u2019t deserve a glass of water from OP if she was on fire.\n\nIf OP\u2019s boyfriend isn\u2019t on their side on this one that\u2019s messed up and she should reconsider her relationship with him. \n\nMary did this to herself by being such a vile human being.", "No, he had no idea. When I called him about my kitty he was 5 states away on thr road. He hung up, called his mom and hounded her for 20 minutes to get thr full story, and then called and related it to me.\n\nAnd I'm going LC or NC with Mary, and if he's not okay with that, well, its my name on the lease and we have separate bills and accounts so  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f he can respectfully take a hike. Maybe that sounds childish but so be it. \n\nAnd omg I didn't even think she'd try to steal it... \ud83d\ude2c \ud83d\ude2c \ud83d\ude2c  oh no....", "Greyhounds go all over the US, it\u2019s not a good experience but neither is waking up to your beloved cat dead in your driveway. \n\nNTA OP. I\u2019m really sorry about your cat and your mils shitty behavior. Set boundaries now and don\u2019t go back on them, she seems like an awful and entitled person and I\u2019d question if my relationship with bf was worth the shit his mother puts you through.", "He was already gone. Auuugh \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d my poor Puddin'.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\nYou win internet for me today", "My bf paid for the repairs and cleaned out the car. To be honest I was so upset I could barely even think about having to clean that mess. Ughh again, I know I may be childish here but...I mean, we had an agreement???!!! Idk :(", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

There are many other ways to get to see her father that does not involve Op's car", "Put spaces in Y. T. A or it counts as her judgement", "Seriously.

You're not being childish. She killed your cat. \n\nYou don't find it suspicious that your bf immediately knew his mum killed your cat? You get how insane that is right? The man didn't even have to ask any other questions, he knew his mum did it.\n\nI know it's not the answer you want to hear, but get these people out of your life. I can't believe your boyfriend, who knew his mother killed your cat, is asking you to help her. Did he hate your cat or something? All absolutely insane.", "I was asking because I wanted to know what judgement your boyfriend should receive for his part in this. \n\nNTA. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. She's proven that she's irresponsible with your belongings by constantly damaging them, and she even killed your cat (and didn't express any remorse for it!). If you let her borrow your car again, you'd be the fool. \n\nShe's acting like there are no alternatives... If she needs a car so badly, she can rent one. I assume she doesn't want to rent a car because she knows they'll hold her liable for damages: when she borrows your car she knows she'll get away with it. She's using you. \n\nWhile your boyfriend at least takes some responsibility by paying for the damages, he's still letting her get away with her destruction, her disrespect to your property, and the way she treats you. It's unacceptable that he's trying to convince you to let her borrow it again, instead of telling her to eat dirt and go rent a car. He's enabling her. \n\nLike other people are saying, I would urge you to greatly consider your boyfriend's role in this as well. Do you want to stay with someone who lets his mother treat you like this? What future do you see attached to this family?", "I never said she was an AH for not lending the car, i said she\u2019s was an ah for saying she didn\u2019t care her dad was dying because the dad has done nothing wrong and again it\u2019s also her boyfriends relative", "This, like him trying to hold her and apologize for his mother's behavior is him trying to get her to move past this and bring his mother back in as soon as possible. She needs to leave this guy because he is okay with his mom killing her cat", "She can also pay for a flight and an Uber. Since it\u2019s 12 hours away. If no airport. Then that\u2019s gonna be an expensive taxi. She lost her privileges to be picky about getting places."]}
