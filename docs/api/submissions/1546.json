I loved my cat so, so, so very much. He was there for me through everything I in my life, and had a long healthy future ahead of him.\n\nMonths ago, Mary, my boyfriend's mother, came to me and asked to borrow my car for a road trip and a concert she and her BF wanted to go to.  Now, I was reluctant because thr last time she borrowed a car from me, she puncture a tire and somehow completely destroyed thr brakes. (She also gave me 0 explanation). \n\nBut she begged, BEGGED to take the car. She promised to pay $200, or cost to fix if she damaged anything or made a mess, and that she and her bf wouldn't do anything \"unsavory\" or \"illegal\" (she rolled her eyes while saying this as though i was being stupid).\n\nI finally relented, with thr condition that if anything went wrong she would be financially accountable, and that she would have my car back to me in three days, as i would need it for work. I gave her the keys and told her to pick up rhe car from my place in the morning, as I would be sleeping in. \n\nThe next morning at 8am, I wake up, confused that my cat hadn't yet started bugging me for food. However, I didn't think too much of it until I stepped out onto my front porch. My precious baby was laying there, mangled, in the driveway!\n\nI completely broke down, calling my bf and sobbing. I was so confused; I don't even let my cat outside! I said this to my bf, who got quiet and said he'd call me back in a minute.\n\nTurns out, Mary had decided she was hungry and, using the spare house key on my car keys, had let herself in and left the door open! Then, because it was dark, she had backed over my cat without noticing. My bf called me back and told me this. I was heartbroken, and angry. I called and demanded that they turn around and return my car, but his mom hung up and refused to answer calls and texts after that. \n\nAfter they returned, three days later, I told Mary that she was never, EVER going to borrow anything of mine again. She rolled her eyes. Later, I opened my car door and saw they had completely trashed it. Food, soda, BEER, and cigarette ash were spilled all over the front and back seat. I asked Mary to either clean the car or pay up. She refused. \n\nYesterday, Mary called, hysterically crying over her father's health. Doctors are giving him two weeks, and mary doesn't have a car. (My bf is out of town for work and she cannot use his) she asked me if she could please borrow my car, just for an 8 hour trip. \n\nI said no. And I didn't care.  She screamed I was a c*** and heartless. She said her own father could pass away without being able to say goodbye. And I casually suggested a zoom call. She, understandably, didn't take it well.\n\nLater, my bf and her husband tried to get me to change my mind but I haven't. Every time I start feeling guilty, i replay it all in my mind and get angry about my cat all over again.

It\u2019s easier to emphasise with people you don\u2019t know but OPs other comments made me loose that emphatic view real quick", "Stand your ground, OP. Don\u2019t let her borrow your car. She\u2019s shown you that she\u2019s untrustworthy, cruel, entitled, & irresponsible. She\u2019s trashed your twice and killed your cat and has shown zero remorse. Who knows that she won\u2019t run kill a pedestrian if you let her take it again. \n\nI\u2019m not usually this much of a hard-ass but I strongly think it would be a huge mistake for you to let her take your car.", "NTA and please never help this piece of absolute trash ever again. You need to cut her out of your life.", "She could take a bus, flight or possibly a train. There are other methods of travel. NTA", "All the more reason she can\u2019t use your car. She\u2019s obviously very irresponsible", "Well, that would be a her problem not a you problem. NTA", "If my father was dying I'd move hell and highwater to get to him, not haggle over the cost to get there.", "Yeah, definitely NTA.  Your BF will be back in 4 days.  He can lend her his car then.", "Yeah, she needs to get out.  These people are just awful.  If my guy accidentally ran over an animal he would be devastated.  He wouldn't just be, \"Oh well.  I'll just continue my road trip and shrug when my GF finds it and is destroyed.\" What an A H.", "It\u2019s not just a car. It\u2019s a series of actions and her indifference to killing her pet. Her bf\u2019s mom is a grown ass woman. If she broke up with her bf how would his mom manage? That should be what the mom does now - she burned her bridge. \n\nNTA", "This isn\u2019t the time to stand your ground? After she killed her cat, really? I wouldn\u2019t look the woman in the face again. I would do anything for my boyfriend/husband, but forget this woman. If it\u2019s that big a deal to her boyfriend, he can takeoff of work and take his mom there. Why should she?", "I agree that it's easier to sympathize because we want to do the right thing, but people like the mom make that really difficult", "Exactly. And I sure wouldn\u2019t blame me not getting there on anyone else."]}
