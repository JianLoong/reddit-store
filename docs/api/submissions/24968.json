I don\u2019t know how else to put it & I have no idea what might have caused it. No matter what we try, Abby is relentlessly unkind to me when we\u2019re in the house together.\n\nAt first it was immature kid stuff, like telling me I was ugly and fat and smelly.

She makes specific comments about my flaws every day now, like \u201cyou can see your cellulite through those pants mom.\u201d She\u2019ll tell me I\u2019m getting older and I should be worried her dad will leave me for a younger woman.

She has hidden and damaged my work materials more than once.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t behave like this towards her dad or brother.\n\nI feel like I should be \"strong\" enough to not care but this behavior has really impacted my life. I feel incredibly self-conscious of my appearance and it\u2019s hard to get dressed in the morning. I\u2019m less confident at work and around our friends.  I find myself dreading being in my own house if Abby is going to be there, staying longer at work, going to the gym after work and asking my husband to cook, going right to our room when I\u2019m home to avoid her.

If you're being genuine that you've tried everything (punishment, family therapy, separate therapy, investigating school environments, psychiatric and psychological evaluations, etc.), then it sounds like you're in over your head and can no longer adequately be the parent she needs. Abby is not going to get the help she needs if you have a mental break and your husband and son are now responsible for both your care and Abby.\n\nIf you make the decision for boarding school, consult with a therapist on how to break the news to her, and then keep abreast of her progress so that you can alter her schooling and living situation if and when she or yourself improve so it's less a punishment and more a thing that needs to be done for mental health reasons.", "NTA, sounds like you really tried everything. Your daughter's behavior is very much not normal, but if you took her to various psychiatrists and none of them prescribed anything helpful, there's not much else you can do - maybe try visiting one more while looking into other options (boarding schools etc.)\uff1fIt looks like she is stuck in the \"wanna marry my dad\" period but with teenager's brains and hormones, so your husband can probably influence her more than you can. But he needs to be very strict and authorative making his personal feelings towards her behavior very clear. Is that's how it already is and nothing helps - well, you did your best.\n\nChoosing between your moving out and a boarding school, don't forget about your son, he deserves a family too, living with his mom and dad who love him and each other is definitely better than living with dad and mentally unstable sister with abusive tendencies.", "Info: what KIND of boarding school? There are a lot of \u201ctroubled teen\u201d institutions that are absolutely unconscionable and this is absolutely not ok. \n\nAlso info: in trying therapy, was family therapy ever tried? Or therapy that was for the two of you? Or was it always more like individual therapy? Did anything there work? Are you continuing therapy?\n\nI totally get where you\u2019re coming from and this feels super complicated and overwhelming and I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d do in the situation either (moving out for a while would probably be my suggestion to my partner too!)", "You mentioned therapy but did no elaborate.  Has she been seen by a psychiatrist?  Her behavior is not normal for a 14 year old.  Talk to her pediatrician and ask for a recommendation so she can be medically/emotionally evaluated.  I am so sorry that you are going through this.  I hope that you have your very own therapist.  I can't imagine how hard it must be living with what is going on.  Good luck to you and your family.", "YWNBTA, however I think you and your husband should talk to your daughter about this with a counselor present. She needs to know how deeply her behavior is impacting you - to the point that you've considered moving out.\n\nI'd then ask for a behavior contract with specific rules and boundaries, but also a discussion of attitude in general, and let her know that during her \"probationary period\" you all will be visiting boarding schools and making plans for her to go there if the probationary period doesn't go well.\n\nYou deserve to be happy and comfortable in your own home, and if your daughter doesn't agree, she truly needs to go.", "The thing is. it's horrific to hear that you're having that experience with your own daughter but with any adolescence, there's always a reason. you say you tried everything but it seems there's something going on inside her that she's acting out on you. how does your son and husband treat you? do they treat you with respect? Do you keep a diary with your secrets that your daughter may have stumbled upon? Do you ridicule her passive aggressively? Or did you mention anything in the lines of \"she wasn't a planned baby\" to someone to where she might have heard it.\n\nThe reason why I ask all those questions is because I knew this little girl who had an older sister. she wasn't even in her teens yet and she would act up. For reference, I used to volunteer and teach children at a after school program. She just did not want to go home when her mom would pick her up. When she finally gives in to go home, she would call her mom all kinds of names. So one day, I pulled her mother to the side while her daughter was playing with the other kids and she told me that she was at her wits end. She was close to sending her to a boarding school. I asked what led her to behave that way. \n\nHer mother was very forthcoming. She said her daughter misheard her and her dad talking and how she was a \"mistake\" baby. Then she started to act out. Then her mother would make empty threats as to sending her to boarding school but this made the daughter to strongly believe she wasn't wanted and had her act out more. She played favoritism to her older daughter and would give hand me downs to her youngest. I'm sure you get the picture.\n\nSince I was only volunteering, I had the actual staff talk to her with options. \n\nI know the situation is different with you\n\nSo before I pass on any judgement, I think it's fair for me to say continue with therapy for both you and your daughter SEPARATELY and as a mother, don't give up on your daughter just yet if you truly love her.", "NTA, if you've truly tried everything, it just doesn't seem sustainable to have you and Abby in the same house anymore.", "NTA - Before you ship her off to boarding school, when just the two of you, I'd ask her point blank if someone in the family is SA'ing her or otherwise abusing her.  Seriously ask the question and tell her if so that you will believe her and try to help.\n\nIf she says no and is still really mean (she is horrifically mean, and makes me worried she might be a sociopath, have any pets gone missing in your area?) then you can send her off to boarding school.  Honestly, if she is this bad to you, she might be abusive to her brother where you and her father cannot see it.", "Most kids don't just start acting up for no reason. I saw behaviour like this once, turned out the dad raped her from age 4 to 16 and the mum knew about it. \n\nStraight up, kids don't just become massive pains in the arse because one day they feel like it. Maybe the relationship slowly becomes toxic but something is going on there and I'd need more information. The internet isn't going to answer it for you unfortunately.", "This is a complex and challenging situation, and it's clear that you're struggling with your daughter's behavior and its impact on your well-being. While I can't make a definitive judgment for you, I hope I can provide some insights and considerations to help you make the best decision for your family.\n\nCommunication and Professional Help: It's important to continue seeking professional help, both for your daughter and for your family as a whole. If you haven't already, consider involving a family therapist or counselor to work through the dynamics and underlying issues causing her behavior.\n\nParenting Strategies: Instead of immediately resorting to sending your daughter to boarding school, explore different parenting strategies and interventions. Understanding the reasons behind her behavior and addressing those root causes can be crucial in improving the situation.\n\nImpact on Your Daughter: Sending your daughter to boarding school may feel like a solution to restore peace, but it's important to consider the emotional impact it might have on her. She might interpret it as a rejection and it could strain your relationship further.\n\nOpen Communication: Have open and honest conversations with your daughter about how her behavior is affecting you and the family. Encourage her to express her feelings and concerns as well. Try to find common ground and understanding.\n\nSupport System: Lean on your support system, including your husband and other family members, as you navigate this challenging situation. It's important to work together as a family to find a resolution.\n\nPersonal Well-Being: Your well-being matters too. If you feel that you need some space to cope and gain perspective, taking a temporary break might be beneficial. However, make sure this decision is communicated clearly and with the intention of seeking healing, not avoiding the issue.\n\nLong-Term Impact: Consider the potential long-term effects of the choices you make. Will sending your daughter to boarding school truly address the root causes of her behavior, or will it be a temporary fix?\n\nBalancing Priorities: Balancing the needs of both your daughter and yourself is important. While you need to prioritize your well-being, finding a solution that supports her growth and development is also crucial.\n\nUltimately, it's important to approach this situation with empathy and compassion for your daughter, while also considering your own mental and emotional well-being. Consulting with professionals, including therapists, counselors, and educators, can provide valuable guidance in making an informed decision that is best for your family's overall health and happiness.", "You really can\u2019t just ship your problems away. There is a reason she is acting out and until you can find the root cause, you will have the symptoms. Sounds like you\u2019ve already taken things away from her ( she has a flip phone,etc) and she is still acting out. Sounds like you\u2019ve made her aware how the things she says and does hurts you. Does your husband or son allow her to talk or act that way towards you openly? Has any of the therapist talk to you about her behavior? Like if she shows signs of lacking complete empathy, etc?", "INFO: What have you done so far to figure out the cause of these behavioral changes? A lot of this sounds like just a bad case of being 14, unfortunately sometimes kids really do start to bully one of their parents around this age. But her cutting your hair and breaking stuff seems age inappropriate, have you had her evaluated?", "If you\u2019ve truly tried everything, it\u2019s time to send her to boarding school.  Otherwise, keep trying.\n\nINFO", "NTA\n\nPuberty does strange things to girls.  The pranks are awful, she is mean.  You have done everything you know to do.  Does she want to go to boarding school?  Is she on drugs?  Is she a mean girl at school too?  Does your husband stand up for you?  There has to be something that makes her think it's ok, but like I said, puberty does contribute to big changes in behavior.  Has she seen a dr. about her hormones?", "Not enough information for me to judge, however, research conduct disorder.\n\nDo not over react to it.  Research.  Is there any traumatizing effects in her childhood, or potential that perhaps maybe slipped under your radar?  Not to be accusatory, but do you have any NPD traits(narcissistic).  You don\u2019t have to answer me that, just yourself.  NPD parents can trigger CD in younger folks.\n\nTalk to your therapist, provided they are either a psychologist or psychiatrist.  If it\u2019s just Betty sue with some weekend course, way above her level\n\nSource.  My name is more a statement of fact.  I never went thru CD, as I was born perfect.

I\u2019m wondering if your therapists (or at least your family therapist) is equipped to appropriately assess the situation though. If you\u2019re still going and nothing is improving, and they haven\u2019t given the family any tools resources or info to help figure this out, I worry they may not be.

I ran out of room in the post but wrote more about therapy in another comment.  \n\n\nWe have family therapy & my husband & I also do couples' therapy with that therapist. I also have an individual therapist and so does my daughter. My daughter's therapist is a psychiatrist but has not put her on any medication, we are cautious about medicating her, especially because her behavior seems to be only with me (& sometimes arguments with her school friends, but she doesn't seem to be waging a campaign of hatred against any single other student, just friend group drama) and not all the time.", "She was a planned pregnancy (my son was a surprise in our first year of marriage, but a happy surprise!) and before these changes started, there was nothing I loved more than spending time together. She's a beautiful and capable young woman-- a good student, a talented athlete, and I know moms are biased but I think she's very pretty. I tell her all the time that I'm proud of her and I believe in her.\n\nNo one makes snotty comments in the house except for her-- my son has an attitude sometimes about his chores etc but nothing like this. He's more shy (my daughter is very outgoing) and a good kid. I almost think he's extra nice to me because of my daughter's comments, but maybe he'd have been considerate anyway. \n\nMy husband and I are lucky to have a loving relationship. We speak to each other respectfully (mutual respect and kindness is the foundation of our relationship, which is part of why it hurts that my daughter isn't picking up these values.) He called me beautiful often, and my therapist has wondered if this was part of the problem (since my daughter and I don't look very similar) so now we have a rule that no one comments on anyone's appearance in our household. \n\nI don't have a diary.\n\nI think that answered all the questions -- it does seem weird that there's \"no\" reason but I feel like I've tried everything to find the reason.\n\nWe did worry about the influence of social media (part of why she has a flip phone now) or other kids at school (can't control that.)", "I have asked both of our kids privately before, and have also had grandparents, her aunt, and a teacher ask her if anything was bothering her. She hasn't ever shared anything.

They were close as little kids and now they just seem to find each other a bit annoying but no active conflict.\n\nWe've never had pets at home but she doesn't have a history of physically hurting other kids or anything like that. Her therapist hasn't told us any specific diagnosis for her, the sociopath idea is worrying but it's hard to picture my daughter that way.", "I could never imagine my husband doing that, but I do have the fear that something happened to her which is why I tried to have other adults talk to her to ask if anything happened. More than anything I hope it isn't this. I would much prefer that she just finds me intolerable for whatever reason and dislikes me vs. something happened to her.", "I wish I could find the root cause, we have really tried. My husband, her therapist, our family therapist, and I have all tried to explain how these comments make me feel. She says she didn't mean to hurt my feelings and says sorry (doesn't look sad if that makes sense? but says sorry) and then continues to do it. My husband tells her to knock it off if she does it in front of him, or sends her to her room.  \n\n\nIn terms of empathy, I don't know. She has other friends and doesn't do this to my husband or her brother. She seems to think it's funny when she hurts my feelings but she's not out there torturing animals or anything to my knowledge.", "I couldn't fit all this in the original post, it was removed for being over character limits, but here's what we've tried:\n\n1. Talking to her, as noted above\n2. Consequences: we have tried taking away her allowance, electronics, or grounding her for being unkind. She was grounded from her phone so often that now she permanently just has a flip phone (also because we worried this might be the influence of social media.) We still want her to have a good life and opportunities so we have kept her in her sports & activities & she\u2019s currently allowed to go see friends because honestly, she does this so often and was grounded so often for a few months we were worried about her social life and gave up on the groundings.\n3. So much therapy! I\u2019m in individual therapy, couples\u2019 therapy with my husband, family therapy with my daughter, individual therapy for my daughter\u2026she has not been diagnosed with anything specific and has never given a deeper reason for why she does this. (My therapist has wondered if it\u2019s because she and I are so different in appearance, I am a small, short, slim woman with dark hair and she is taller, broader, and has lighter hair like her father\u2026but she has never mentioned it in family therapy.) We have all lost our temper and yelled at her at least once for this behavior (me when she cut my hair, our son once called her an evil bitch when she said to me in front of him that \u201cstatistically dad will die first and then no one will love or want you mom and you will die alone\u201d and my husband has yelled at her probably 3-4 times.) But we always apologized for yelling. Our family therapist has confirmed to me that while we shouldn\u2019t have yelled, we don\u2019t have an abusive or traumatizing home\u2014 there is no physical violence in our home, and none of us are belittling or insulting each other like my daughter.\n4. Talking to the school, like I mentioned in the post. It doesn\u2019t seem like she's being bullied, and she does have friends, though she gets in arguments with them sometimes it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone is a \u201cbully.\u201d\n5.

She has a regular doctor & annual checkups but we haven't taken her to a specialist for hormones. \n\nI don't believe she's on drugs but have never drug tested her. She's young enough that she hangs out with her friends in public places and is otherwise at activities or at home-- none of her friends are driving yet or out late at night. \n\nWe haven't spoken to her about boarding school yet, I am worried that it would be hurtful to bring it up so we are trying to make that decision first.", "It might be time to change and find another psychiatrist for your daughter, because this is not normal behavior at all and goes way beyond bullying. This also sounds like it's impacting your teenage son (you said he snapped and called her an evil bitch at one point).", "Im 13, this is not normal behaviour. Obviously don't listen to reddit and jump to conclusions that your husband is a predator but something is wrong.", "I was once told that a child will make you feel how they feel. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how to help you find the cause. What I would say is don\u2019t abandon your family. Your daughter needs to learn respect in the way that she talks to you. Anytime she makes a comment I would set that boundary that she should not talk to you like that and send her to her room if she continues. Same for your husband if he\u2019s present, don\u2019t yell, just stay calm and firm united that her behavior is unacceptable. If she apologizes, I would thank her for her apology and let her know that you will talk to your husband about how your daughter will make it right (ideas below). Ignoring/avoiding what\u2019s happening isn\u2019t going to make things better. If you haven\u2019t already, I would express to her how much the things she says and does hurts you and express that you really just don\u2019t understand what\u2019s changed, but offer your support that she can talk about whatever is going on with you and you will hear her. \n\nIdeas:\nThere are always consequences to behavior and saying sorry isn\u2019t enough to change character.

Sometimes friends know but might be afraid to break the trust of the friend by going to the parents. However, when asked, especially out of concern, they might open up or give you hints. Maybe the brother can also ask so it's not an adult asking, which could be intimidating for teens sometimes.", "NTA - though please make sure you don\u2019t send her to some fly by troubled teen boarding school.

Are you sure you didn't do something to her for her to act this way? Do you tell her to change her clothes for any reason ? Do you tell her she needs to take a shower cause she smells ? Have you done anything shes done or said around her?", "Thank you, her therapist is a psychiatrist but hasn't thought medication is appropriate. So far her behavior is just towards me, not 24/7.", "I was like 10 when I got mine and for a bunch of the year before I was just FILLED WITH RAGE constantly. Hated it. It levelled out eventually, but I was also diagnosed with a hormone disorder by 15. A hormone panel would be a good idea.\n\nAlso just talking to her GP. A severe personality change is a big thing and it's worth doing a full physical to make sure nothing's going on, like a brain tumour or something.\n\nIf all those come up clean... something's gotta give imo.", "Im curios, what happens in that series?", "Oh 12 year olds 100% know what cellulite is. I'm 31 and I knew what it was and that it was undesirable by the time I was 10.\n\n\nBut I do agree that the old and unwanted by men stuff is very manosphere adjacent.", "We did have that concern which is why we took her phone away but of course she could be using friends\u2019 devices and we have a family computer she uses for homework\u2014 I have no doubt she\u2019s more tech savvy than I am & uses the internet, but at least with the flip phone she\u2019s not scrolling social media all day.\n\nThe cellulite comment was more recently at 14 and sadly that could be from magazines or TV or anywhere. But her insults have gotten very creative.\n\nI hope she\u2019s not on TikTok! \n\nMy therapist does think she may be comparing herself to me, but she doesn\u2019t do that openly. I", "Your comment really touched me, I'm so sorry you had to go through that. I do think it's possible that something similar is going on with my daughter. \n\nWe have all this therapy exactly for that kind of thing-- self-esteem issues & navigating being a teen, I hope it's something she feels she can talk to her therapist about. Her therapist has certainly never come to me and said \"aha, this is the answer!\" While we want to respect the privacy of therapy (the therapist certainly doesn't report back everything they talk about) her therapist knows how serious these issues have become in our family & I hope she'd tell us if she found the explanation...\n\nWe did tell her she was beautiful growing up & I genuinely believe it. She sadly has never shared with me who any of her crushes were, I think because she became so antagonistic towards me right around that age when crushes might be beginning. We did give her \"the talk\" about a year ago and to my knowledge she has not dated anyone. If her friends are dating, she hasn't shared that with me-- at that age, I'm sure some are, I had my first \"boyfriend\" at 13. I'll talk to her therapist about it (I doubt she'd want to talk about it in front of all of us at family therapy!)\n\nI have definitely told her she can tell me anything and if anything happened to her I'd support her 100%, other trusted adults have done the same. She mostly just gave a lot of attitude in those conversations-- she told me to fuck off, told her dad that was a gross question, kind of gave the eyeroll/brush off to her aunt and grandparents like \"okkkk thank you\" & ended the conversation etc. I really really hope it's not that.", "Thank you!", "No, but if she doesn\u2019t like her therapist she\u2019ll start refusing to go. At least liking her therapist she goes and hopefully is getting something out of it.", "I would try another psychiatrist who is not her therapist. Just to get another opinion, since her behavior is quite challenging.", "I guess I was pretty blessed as a child then. I didn't understand cellulite or stretch marks til I was like 17. \n\nYeah her insults reminded me of what right wing dudes say to put down women. It makes no sense for a teenage girl to come up with this on her own. But then again andrew tate is popular with some teenage boys so maybe shes overhearing it in class...", "If shes sneaking a device in, its likely an old phone that no longer has a sim card. It will be connected to your wifi at home. I would check to see if theres any unknown devices on your network, because then you can confirm she does have a device. I imagine if shes on the family computer she might be erasing her history but maybe monitor when shes on the computer too.\n\nA lot of her insults are what manosphere guys say... Shes either picking it up online or listening to male classmates who idolize Andrew Tate or something. Teenage girls can be mean, but I've never seen a teenage girl insult women for getting too old and unable to find a boyfriend/husband. Thats a very odd thing, usually comes from men.\n\n The fact she also joked her brother will likely die alone or end up unmarried because \"statistics\" is another manosphere idea.", "I'm glad she's got people to talk to and you and your husband are doing so much.\n\nI've been reading more of your comments... has she been evaluated by a psychiatrist? One of my cousins has borderline personality disorder. And the way your daughter acts kind of reminds me of that. Not trying to diagnose your daughter at all, just saying that while therapists are great for a lot of things, they don't have the experience with big psycological issues that psychologist and psychiatrists are trained to diagnose and treat.", "You could ask r/parenting too.", "My concern is that she likes the therapist because he\u2019s easy to snow and doesn\u2019t call her on her bullshit the way she needs to be. \n\nNTA, op. You\u2019re worried that she\u2019d feel unwelcome at home, but the truth is that as long as her behavior remains unchanged, she needs to feel that way. Her actions have consequences."]}
