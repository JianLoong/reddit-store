I do not know how strict you are about having men around but you should know, so you can make a decision whether you want to be in the same place or not. \n\nAssuming you have discussed your religious requirements and she has agreed, at the very least she should notify you, because it could easily be the equivalent of blocking you from your own home to have a man there with no chaperone.

She can get him to the right people to get him shelter, benefits for free food, healthcare.  You are not running a shelter and you don't know what this man will bring into your home. For example, when I lived in a women's shelter, the men's shelter on the opposite end of the property frequently had issues with scabies and bedbugs.\n\nI suggest this because even if you're evicting her, you'll likely be stuck with her as a roommate for another 30 days (or whatever duration is legally required to give her). Her giving him free reign is absolutely unacceptable and like another person said, this is only what you CAUGHT. Who knows what goes on when you're not home. Safeguard yourself with preventative measures (locks and a camera), check for theft, and launder everything that was used immediately.\n\nYou definitely don't know the full story about the guy, how often he's there, or even WHY she has taken a huge interest in him. It could be benign, or he could possibly be a connect (drugs). Regardless, the roommate needs to go, you need to protect yourself, and you shouldn't have to worry about strangers appearing in your bed. If you get her to move, hopefully you can make the time between now and her departure as safe and tolerable as possible. \n\nGood luck!", "If she wants help, she should share her own bed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You still for the reasons about but less than I originally thought.

For instance, substance abuse disorder or untreated mental illness. An unpredictable strange *man* should not be invited into OPs home, the home of two young single women.

Take inventory, if anything is missing, notify police and press charges.  Place all bedding in a bag, disinfect your room and charge your roommate. If utilities are in her name, don't pay your portion until it equals the costs you incurred due to her actions.\n\n-Immediately notify your landlord about a HEALTH and SAFETY issue.  The homeless in the US have high rates of tuberculosis and as others have stated, potentially fleas and bedbugs on their clothing.  I imagine your landlord doesn't want an infestation and costs s/he would incur. Also is he left unattended at your apt when neither of you are home?  Does he have access to a hidden key or maybe memorized the code on a keypad? Your roommate violated your trust and boundaries but roommate conflicts in themselves are not something landlords normally want to get involved with.  More reason to emphasize health and safety.  The landlord is in a better position to possibly terminate the lease immediately for one or both of you, change locks, use her deposit, etc.  Negotiating with your roommate will get you nowhere by the sounds of it.\n\n-There  are other issues such as how often he is around and whether that violates the terms of the lease on an additional roommate, higher utilities, does he bring substances, potential for violence, etc. But these are maybes, you haven't observed yet.  \n\n- Again, get the landlord/property manager involved, document with dates and times of all incidents on paper and submit to landlord, any paperwork from police if they become involved due to any theft,drugs or acts of violence.", "NTA.

I thought they had the *real* problems since I didn't do drugs *every* day. \n\nI had to take a big step back and see I was *not* ok, I had just gotten way too comfortable surrounding myself with dysfunctional people.

I just can't live with anyone who makes that decision for me. I wouldn't feel comfortable relying on my roommates ability to judge how safe someone is.

I'll go organise you a ticker-tape parade for such a high achievement.", "Direct quote from OP \u201cI was mad that Erin had Sam over before as she didn\u2019t tell me about it. When we have people over (especially males as I wear a hijab), we tell the other housemate, but she didn\u2019t\u201d OPs fine with her bringing people over but not without her knowledge and ESPECIALLY not an unknown man due to her wearing a hijab and the risk of being seen not wearing it by a strange man", "No, NTA. It's reasonable to be upset with your housemate for allowing a homeless man into your home without your knowledge or consent. It's a breach of trust and a potential safety concern. \n\nYou have the right to feel uncomfortable with someone you don't know having access to your living space, especially when you explicitly expressed your concerns. \n\nYour reaction to finding him in your bed was justified, and you have the right to establish boundaries for your personal space.", "Nah fam, crabs, them shits don't just live in pubes but beards as well", "This story oozes everything wrong with SF", "I'd feel comfortable sleeping anywhere a resident of the house told me I could sleep. As a guest, you take cues from the host.\n\nFor me, This whole situation comes down on the AH roommate.", "You don\u2019t think Erin\u2019s overall judgement is sus when she puts Sam in OPs bed? \n\nOP doesn\u2019t have enough of a relationship with Erin to trust her judgement in lieu of own and she has no relationship to Sam to trust him at all. Erin has broken all trust. OP has no reason to be examining  her personal bias of the homeless when she and her  home are not secure. Everyone virtue signaling here are sitting tight in front of a screen. \n\nI\u2019ve volunteered at a hypothermia shelter. There are strict rules in place for how we interact with the residents. Giving them things that are not shelter provided is a no. Too much personally identifying info is also a bad idea. Focus attention and conversation on them if they\u2019re eager to talk", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s harsh but the reality is homeless people are carriers of diseases and parasites. You might think I\u2019m just hating but it\u2019s the truth. If you work in a hospital or around children you\u2019re not allowed to do homeless outreach.\n\nHe was in your bed? That is\u2026disgusting.", "NTA. U need to call your landlord and get her kicked out. If he was sleeping in her room and is only around when she is, thats mostly her business; especially if she claims that is her friend. But she let him sleep on your bed! Wtf? No way.", "NTA get out of there as fast as possible", "That is just *wrong*. Sleeping on your bed? EWWWWWWWW. I don't care if he's homeless or not, you don't let someone use someone else's bed without permission.\n\nNTA. But sounds like Erin has a big case of Saviour Complex. You should look for somewhere else to live (or a new roommate, whichever is easier).", "Honestly. How well do you know someone after a few months? \nLet's for the fun of it, say 2-3 months. \n\nHow much do they sit and talk based on she cooks some food and drops it off. An hours worth of talk pr meeting? \nAnd we assume what he tells her is truthful. \n\nThis statement goes for everyone you come in contact with, online, at work, a bar, a cafe you both use in lunch break. \nHow well do you know them? \nHow often have we heard some family member, or super close friend, who has known a person for 20+ years, say, \"I can't believe he/she did,\"insert a big crime\" that!!. They are so nice and well loved!\" \nSomeone starts dating someone at work, and they turn out to be like the guy from \"you\" but he was so nice and polite at work? \n\nNow I'm not saying you should fear every single person in the world. \nBut to state, \"but he is not a stranger to her after a few months\" is not a safety guarantee. \nespecially when he is a stranger to OP still. \nHomeless or multi millionaire. He is still a stranger/beginning friend after a few months.", "Yes. The fact that he's homeless is a red herring. The roommate shouldn't be letting anyone sleep in OP's bed without OP's permission, full stop.\n\nThis happened to me once in a shared house - I returned after some time away, and it was clear someone had slept in my bed. It was a visiting friend of one of my housemates. Still a complete violation of trust, as I wasn't asked and they didn't even change the damn bedding.", "I\u2019m just saying he\u2019s not inherently dangerous just because he\u2019s homeless. The roommate is clearly friends with him, for months. She likely has a vibe on his danger level.\n\nMy cousin is just a see the best in everyone person who works with the homeless so she was easily manipulated by one guy. Doesn\u2019t mean all homeless people are like that, that\u2019s just a human thing. I can name more non-homeless people who have committed acts of poisoning that homeless people.", "It's a classic reddit technique for when wrong, \"I'm done arguing not because I don't have anymore coherent arguments but rather because I'm so right it's pointless\". Seen it many times", "I average 300 likes a day for my comments, even though I'm being \"overly abrasive\". That doesn't make sense"]}
