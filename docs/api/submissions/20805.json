Erin and I aren't very close and will only talk if I run into her in our shared spaces, living room/kitchen. Erin told me a while back she befriended a homeless man, Sam. She used to give him spare change and started to cook for him, so he would have something to eat. That is completely her business.\n\nHowever, last month she gave him our address and told him he can come pick up food from ours. She didn't tell me this until I found out as we have a ring doorbell, which has a camera that alerts your phone if someone comes over. I normally don't check as I am at work most days and most the alerts are just someone walking by. I am only in the house to sleep or my one day off. Erin knows if I have 2+ days off I usually go see my parents who live in the same city, but it is a long commute so not feasible everyday.\n\nI had a parcel coming last week, so did check the phone alert, and saw Sam at our door. She has shown me pictures of him, so I knew it was him and I was angry she had given our location to a stranger. I confronted her over this as I feel that this is unsafe and uncomfortable that he know knows our address? She told me that he was only there to eat food and stays in the kitchen. Erin argued that I have friends over all the time too, and I am judging him for being homeless. I let it go, but told her that I don't want him to be anywhere near my room.\n\nI went home for 3 days and usually I go straight from my parents to work, but I came last night around 11pm instead as I was scheduled to come in earlier. I found Sam was sleeping in my bed. We have a single bed each and I screamed, waking up both Erin and Sam. I told him if he didn't get out now I would call the police for trespassing. Sam left and Erin is now angry at me and will not speak to me.\n\neta- I was mad that Erin had Sam over before as she didn't tell me about it.

You have no idea what she is up to for the rest of your time away from the house and what other liberties she is taking and allowing others to take with your privacy.\n\nIf your landlord fails to act, I would seriously consider moving yourself as your current housemate has absolutely no respect for you.", "NTA\n\nI'll be honest, my judgement was going a different way until\n\n> I came last night around 11pm instead as I was scheduled to come in earlier. I found Sam was sleeping in my bed\n\nThis is absolutely not OK. Sure, judging a homeless person because they are homeless is very much a violation of rule 1 but your housemate absolutely fucked up here. \n\nYou have every right to be angry, and Erin has no right to be anything other than apologetic. That is a huge violation of privacy by letting him sleep in your bed.", "NTA - he was sleeping in your bed?! Nope.", ">Erin is now angry at me and will not speak to me.\n\nOMG! She is blatant idiot. I would seriously consider breaking lease with her and separate completely. This is not just complete disrespect of your privacy and boundaries, but clearly dangerous behavior. Don't forget to clean your room thoroughly or hire deep cleaning team (and hand her a bill) and wash all your things in very hot water as there might be flees and lice and god knows what other infections.\n\nNTA", "NTA, your housemate is an idiot and placed you in potential danger.", "NTA- getting upset with someone invading your privacy (both your space and religion) is completely justified.", "Nta\n\nShe had him sleeping IN Your bed.\n\nI do feel sorry for Sam because I doubt she made situation clear-- that you did not know nor gave permission.", "NTA.", "NTA \n\nIt was already wayyyyy over the line to let Sam know where two single girls live alone and completely ridiculous, off the cliff, to let him sleep in your bed!!\n\nRoommate is living in her own world and no regard for safety\n\nAnd also if you wear hijab it is common courtesy for her to inform you if any man might be in your living area, not just Sam. I do not know how strict you are about having men around but you should know, so you can make a decision whether you want to be in the same place or not. \n\nAssuming you have discussed your religious requirements and she has agreed, at the very least she should notify you, because it could easily be the equivalent of blocking you from your own home to have a man there with no chaperone. Or, if you are not so strict, you might automatically remove hijab when you get home because why would you think a man would be there?", "NTA - He shouldn\u2019t be in your room. I would look to find another place to live and definitely call the police if you find him there again.", "NTA - Ok, you were judgmental about him being homeless and coming around just to pick up food, especially in the light of the fact you also have guests in the place you share with another person.\n\nSam sleeping in your bed is a big no-no. I would report your housemate's behaviour to your landlord and ask for the termination of her letting agreement since there's a severe breach of trust. Your room is your private space; no one should enter it without your express consent. Erin fucked up big time since she allowed someone who's a stranger to you to invade your privacy and even sleep in your bed without you knowing.", "I was headed a completely different direction until the bed plot twist. Nope. NTA.\n\nI can't believe your roommate thought that would be remotely okay. I wonder if this is the first times she's allowed this?", "NTA. It\u2019s already bad that she didn\u2019t talk with you about sharing your address with a stranger. But it\u2019s completely unacceptable for Erin to allow Sam to sleep in your bed directly after you told her not to allow him anywhere near your room.", "NTA and Erin needs to deep clean your bed spread", "Nta get a new roommate", "NTA.\n\nYou are right, it is indeed unsafe to give your address and have someone else sleep on your bed?! HELL NO. She crossed boundaries when she let a stranger sleep on your bed.", "NTA\n\nI don't know how receptive Erin is with things, but maybe try to tell her about local resources for the homeless and explain that aside from her generosity OUTSIDE of your home, this is the best way to help him, if that's her goal. She can get him to the right people to get him shelter, benefits for free food, healthcare.  You are not running a shelter and you don't know what this man will bring into your home. For example, when I lived in a women's shelter, the men's shelter on the opposite end of the property frequently had issues with scabies and bedbugs.\n\nI suggest this because even if you're evicting her, you'll likely be stuck with her as a roommate for another 30 days (or whatever duration is legally required to give her). Her giving him free reign is absolutely unacceptable and like another person said, this is only what you CAUGHT. Who knows what goes on when you're not home. Safeguard yourself with preventative measures (locks and a camera), check for theft, and launder everything that was used immediately.\n\nYou definitely don't know the full story about the guy, how often he's there, or even WHY she has taken a huge interest in him. It could be benign, or he could possibly be a connect (drugs). Regardless, the roommate needs to go, you need to protect yourself, and you shouldn't have to worry about strangers appearing in your bed. If you get her to move, hopefully you can make the time between now and her departure as safe and tolerable as possible. \n\nGood luck!", "If she wants help, she should share her own bed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Plenty of ways she can help homeless people, this isn\u2019t 1 that is safe, giving your address to him was bad enough then letting him sleep in your bed?!

Then both of you are. She is not discussing giving your address out and telling him to come by whenever with zero thought to you and your feelings. You still for the reasons about but less than I originally thought. To you aren't what so ever because she never discussed him coming over at all or the biggest thing her letting him sleep in YOUR bed. That's completely disrespectful and jumped miles over the line of ok. See how you can go about breaking the lease or removing yourself and get a new place without this roommate. She can have this homeless person move in and room with her and take care of him all she wants then.", "Nothing like volunteering someone else's stuff.", "This honestly is such a dangerous situation. The roomate is not only an asshole but also short-sighted.

I had roommates do this with family and hookups and it was awful. she also does not respect your boundaries considering that you wear hijab. it would be the same if she gave a significant other a key without telling you, too. you should have a written roommate agreement that says people can\u2019t have guests while they aren\u2019t there unless it has been discussed beforehand.", "NTA.

What he has told her may not be accurate. \n\nIt is nice that she cooks for him and takes him food, but she should not have brought him to a  home she shares with others.", "ESH. You are being an asshole because you absolutely are judging someone for being homeless as a risk to you and your stuff when, at least so far, it doesn\u2019t sound like they have given you any reason to be concerned. Your roommate is an asshole for not respecting your boundaries. When you asked them to keep him out of your room and stuff, they allowed him to sleep in your bed and that is not acceptable. Regardless of whether he is homeless or not.", "NTA. Your roommate is. One of you has to have, either her or you.", "NTA and what your flatmate is doing is totally insane and naive. Putting aside the outrage of her letting him use your personal space (I'm a guy and I probably would have gotten violent over this and physically removed him, it's unbelievable) you still have the fact she's giving access, to the home of two young women, to a strange desperate man she doesn't really know.

I don\u2019t really agree with the comment you replied to but it\u2019s slightly more complicated", "I\u2019m sorry, but people that have been unhoused for long periods of time are almost always in that situation due to very unfortunate circumstances. For instance, substance abuse disorder or untreated mental illness. An unpredictable strange *man* should not be invited into OPs home, the home of two young single women. Pretending this is just like inviting over a friend or coworker is so obtuse and it doesn\u2019t make you seem more righteous to ignore the glaring the reality of what is most likely Sam\u2019s situation- it\u2019s ignorant."]}
