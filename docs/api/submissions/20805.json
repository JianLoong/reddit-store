That is completely her business.\n\nHowever, last month she gave him our address and told him he can come pick up food from ours. She didn't tell me this until I found out as we have a ring doorbell, which has a camera that alerts your phone if someone comes over.

She has shown me pictures of him, so I knew it was him and I was angry she had given our location to a stranger. I confronted her over this as I feel that this is unsafe and uncomfortable that he know knows our address? She told me that he was only there to eat food and stays in the kitchen.

I do not know how strict you are about having men around but you should know, so you can make a decision whether you want to be in the same place or not. \n\nAssuming you have discussed your religious requirements and she has agreed, at the very least she should notify you, because it could easily be the equivalent of blocking you from your own home to have a man there with no chaperone. Or, if you are not so strict, you might automatically remove hijab when you get home because why would you think a man would be there?", "NTA - He shouldn\u2019t be in your room.

She can get him to the right people to get him shelter, benefits for free food, healthcare.  You are not running a shelter and you don't know what this man will bring into your home. For example, when I lived in a women's shelter, the men's shelter on the opposite end of the property frequently had issues with scabies and bedbugs.\n\nI suggest this because even if you're evicting her, you'll likely be stuck with her as a roommate for another 30 days (or whatever duration is legally required to give her). Her giving him free reign is absolutely unacceptable and like another person said, this is only what you CAUGHT. Who knows what goes on when you're not home. Safeguard yourself with preventative measures (locks and a camera), check for theft, and launder everything that was used immediately.\n\nYou definitely don't know the full story about the guy, how often he's there, or even WHY she has taken a huge interest in him. It could be benign, or he could possibly be a connect (drugs). Regardless, the roommate needs to go, you need to protect yourself, and you shouldn't have to worry about strangers appearing in your bed.

For instance, substance abuse disorder or untreated mental illness. An unpredictable strange *man* should not be invited into OPs home, the home of two young single women.

If utilities are in her name, don't pay your portion until it equals the costs you incurred due to her actions.\n\n-Immediately notify your landlord about a HEALTH and SAFETY issue.  The homeless in the US have high rates of tuberculosis and as others have stated, potentially fleas and bedbugs on their clothing.  I imagine your landlord doesn't want an infestation and costs s/he would incur. Also is he left unattended at your apt when neither of you are home?  Does he have access to a hidden key or maybe memorized the code on a keypad? Your roommate violated your trust and boundaries but roommate conflicts in themselves are not something landlords normally want to get involved with.  More reason to emphasize health and safety.  The landlord is in a better position to possibly terminate the lease immediately for one or both of you, change locks, use her deposit, etc.  Negotiating with your roommate will get you nowhere by the sounds of it.\n\n-There  are other issues such as how often he is around and whether that violates the terms of the lease on an additional roommate, higher utilities, does he bring substances, potential for violence, etc. But these are maybes, you haven't observed yet.  \n\n- Again, get the landlord/property manager involved, document with dates and times of all incidents on paper and submit to landlord, any paperwork from police if they become involved due to any theft,drugs or acts of violence.", "NTA.

The only difference is this guy is homeless, which doesn\u2019t make him automatically dangerous. \n\nThe issue is they agreed to tell each other when inviting people over and OP expressly instructed her roommate to keep him out of her bedroom - those are the boundaries that were crossed and that\u2019s what makes OP NTA.", "you shouldn't give your room mates bad to a blood relation without her knowing, never mind a homeless man.", "and their food too", "I\u2019d say ESH. She\u2019s still an AH for all the stuff before. Just because the roommate was doing/ended up doing worse doesn\u2019t rid her of the judgement.", "What is wrong with you?", "My parents helped one. My mom helped a homeless guy when I was a kid. His name was \u201cdoc\u201d. He was a veteran. \n\nShe took him in, fed him and I played with him as a child etc. Set him up with a home and got him back on his feet. So, one. Wasn\u2019t the basement though. I don\u2019t live with my mom anymore. She died about 10 years ago. I recognize this is hard to fathom, but homeless people are also people. They sometimes just need some help. The issue here was that the roommate was volunteered to help and that isn\u2019t right.\n\nWhere I grew up, (DC), there were a lot of homeless people. I guess I just never stopped seeing them as human beings who are worse/more risky than other human beings.", "Also, I was briefly without a home (few months) and a friend put me up until I was able to get back on my feet so, I guess I am biased.", "For context, I work in the Emergency Department of a hospital in a city with a very high homeless population. A good amount of that population are fairly harmless which is why I didn't have anything against Erin making food for Sam. If anything, it's pretty cool of her to do so. Certainly not every one is harmless; we definitely have a fair amount who have various psychiatric concerns and are considered to be a \"staff safety\" issue, but not every homeless person should be treated like a crazy person.\n\nHowever, I do 100% draw the line at letting Sam sleep in OP's bed (and well before that to be perfectly honest). It's one thing to feed someone or give them your address, it's another to let them fuckin' invade another person's private living space. I mean, fuck, Sam shouldn't have been allowed in OP's room for any reason, let alone sleep in her fucking bed. I would've said NTA if Sam used OP's private bathroom cause that wouldn't have been cool either.", "She wasn't giving away OP's food though.", "Don\u2019t forget bedbugs!! \ud83e\udee3\ud83e\udee3", "We live in a world where the majority of homeless are unpredictable and dangerous.

It\u2019s not really their fault and there are exceptions on both sides, but that is irrelevant when it\u2019s your safety at risk", "She was allowing a homeless man full access to her kitchen and bedroom.", "A lot of our homeless were put up in cheap motels occasionally and yes, bedbugs were rampant, and roaches in their belongings. It's a shame, but the unmitigated gall of this person's room mate just thinking she can do that would lead me to be...not a nice person.", "Ps you have been reported for being hostile / rude and blocked.", "That\u2019s another time you read poorly and made a general and inaccurate statement about what I am or what I said.\n\nI think perhaps you are the delusional one. \n\nYour general statements about \u201cthe world we live in\u201d make me think you have a lot more to learn about it than you currently think you know. \n\nBest of luck. \n\nMaybe one day you\u2019ll be in a position where you are able to learn a few new things about \u201cthe world\u201d you think we live in versus the world we all actually live in.\n\nCheers.", "Which for me begs the question: how long has Erin been letting Sam use OP's bed?\n\n\nCause if she only found out because she came home *early*, then I get the sinking suspicion that this wasn't a one-time thing. Not only that, but while a good amount of homeless folks are indeed harmless, I have had to get in a bunny suit to help decontaminate a few with lice, bed bugs, and other creepy-crawlies.", "Clearly you don't know many homeless people", "How were they hostile?", "Tell the landlord that your roommate let a homeless person stay in your room and you don't feel safe anymore.

Except for Sam. \n\nYou call him a stranger but also say she befriended him over time. You may not know him but as stated ur roomie doesnt know your friends whom u bring over without discussion...\n\nYou accetped him being around and set the boundary of not allowing him in ur room but he was in ur bed. Your roomie seems to not want to inform him of ur didcomfort. Which puts Sam in a uncomfy spot, at risk of having police called on him when he may not have been aware of said boundary.\n\nI would take the chance to get to know sam if possible. Tell him directly of your boundaries, cause honestly ur roomie doesnt seem to want to do it herself. Him being homeless doesnt make him a criminal or unresonable person. And having him on security footage is already insurance if anything goes sideway, i dont see it being wrong to discuss with him directly again given that ur roomie is not following thru.\n\nSorry ur in this situation. Seems so damn stressful.", "NTA\n\nComing over and eating in the kitchen...okay, she's got a fair point about you having friends over in your shared spaces as well. \n\nSleeping in your bed...no.  That's not even a discussion.  I'd be looking to terminate the lease.  That's a huge invasion of your personal space.", "They are friends. Yes, friends stop by sometimes, but to invite him to sleep in your bed is not ok.", "NTA. She let a guest sleep IN YOUR BED. Would she even have told you if you hadn\u2019t found him?! That\u2019s gross!", "NTA. I was thinking you are 100% TA right up until the sleeping in your bed thing.

How else were you supposed to react to a stranger sleeping in your bed. Ask her why she didnt let him sleep in her bed. She needs to go, that'd be a deal breaker for me. She's the huge A.", "NTA. Burn your bedding and GTFO of there ASAP. Your roommate is beyond inconsiderate to the point of narcissism or even maliciousness. No good can come of living with such an individual.", "NTA, OP. \n\nI deal with a lot of homeless here in my home city and sometimes they don't wash, they can have bugs, or skin related issues. Its time to go to the Landlord because this could become a greater issue.", "NTA! This wouldn\u2019t have been okay even if it was Erin\u2019s twin sister, someone with a home that she had known her whole life, because it\u2019s your bed. It\u2019s not okay to share your bed without your permission. It\u2019s extra worse, in my opinion, to allow a man to sleep in your bed when you\u2019re a hijabi. You need to escalate this to your landlord immediately, because she will continue to stomp all over your safety and boundaries.", "NTA. The only person who has a right to allow someone to sleep in your bed is YOU. This is a breach of trust and completely disrespectful.", "NTA. To anyone who doesn't see a problem with the roommate giving out her address without asking first, is completely oblivious to the massive boundary that was crossed. Yes, homeless people are human beings that deserve to be treated with respect and have the same rights that we all do. However, it's very fair to have concerns that there may be mental illness that you're unaware of because it's either episodic or currently managed with medication. If you live alone and are comfortable with inviting the unknown into your house, that's your business. You don't get to make that decision for others. If you want to help, do it safely.

OP was shitty for multiple reasons including the judgmental attitude of homeless man bad and getting mad at roommate for inviting him over at all. Acting like he\u2019s a stranger was odd too. Stranger to her sure, but not the roommate at this point. Being controlling about who can come over based on her not having met the person is AH behavior unless they agreed on mutual meetings elsewhere first (didn\u2019t see that anywhere). Roommate definitely should not have let the person sleep in her bed and should have said she had someone coming over. Hence my ESH.
