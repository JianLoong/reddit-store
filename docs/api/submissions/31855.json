She's depressed and needs to deal with her feelings and issues. You cannot and should not stop living your life because of this. The best you can do for her is to acknowledge the fact that it's hard for her and help her to get help.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I had a fun night and so did my friends but my gf was upset with me that I had decided to do this while she was feeling sad and depressed and told me I should have canceled my hangout night with my friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh fuck that. She shouldn't be taking it out on you. And she was asleep anyway, so it looks like another circumstance where a person is dealing with something they can't directly grapple with, so they project the source of their misery onto the closest target they feel comfortable attacking *because then they are directly grappling with something*.", "NTA. As someone who's struggled with depression - misery loves company, but if you cancel the things that bring you joy, that just makes for two miserable people. There's a balance here ofc - I'm sure she just wants to feel supported, and maybe you can find other ways to do that, based on a conversation around the support she currently needs. But I don't think you did anything wrong here.", "Info:\n\nDoes she have a habit of cancelling her own plans and then expecting you to cancel your own to hang out with her?", "NTA, she changed all her plans, she went to sleep within 30 minutes, what is her problem, did you have to go to bed with her?", "NTA but you need to stand up for yourself. Not just because it's unfair to you, but because giving in and apologising simply because you don't want fight is not a solution and can absolutely ruin a relationship.\n\nYou also need to find better ways to communicate. Let her know that you are there for her, but she needs to communicate what she needs.", "NTA, You had prior commitments and she should understand that she can't ruin your plans cause shes sad. The only thing I could've suggested is to express that she is important to you and you are concerned about her and want to address that after your commitment.", "NTA. This is a miscommunication, mainly owing to her not expressing what she wanted. I'm guessing you're not a mind-reader, so it is up to her to tell you if she is feeling something and wanting something. I'd ask whether this is already a well-established dynamic in which she expects you to spend time with her when she is feeling sad and depressed, to the exclusion of others. \n\nThat said, she's NTA either. She's depressed and she needs help. Does she get counseling? Have you suggested that she do so? You should. And also maybe have a talk about what each of you should do when this situation or a similar one arises.", "NAH, but she does need to communicate needs or expectations better. Depression is suffocating and lonely and feeling like a partner is dismissing your needs/wants to hangout with friends hurts, but unless she clearly asked if you would spend time with her since she\u2019s in such a rough spot this is an unreasonable expectation on her part. Does she have a therapist? What other support is she getting? Do her friends know why she cancelled? You should not be her only support system that will put a huge strain on you both as well as the relationship.", "NTAH.\n\nDepression sucks, and you're there for her offering help.\n\nHowever this doesn't mean you should jeopardize your life and happiness. Especially your social life. Then you're both depressed and that does no-one any good.\n\nShe needs to speak to a professional if she genuinely thinks she is depressed. It's a complicated subject that only she can talk about how/why she feels the way she does.", "Apparently I'm the only one who sees this as a deliberate attempt at manipulation on girlfriend's part. She planned a fun night out with pals, OP was supposed to languish at home, lonely and missing her. But he decided to have fun too, so she was suddenly too depressed to go out, so, \"No, No, You have Your Fun...I'll Be Fine\": translation, you're supposed to drop everything to massage my feet and murmur words of sympathy and devotion.\n\nI think she's a controlling, manipulating, selfish person. He's only allowed fun on her terms, and if not, he better grovel for a month.\n\nYou're NTA, rethink the relationship.", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry, you probably don't want to hear this but she's straight up communicated to you that she's struggling. \n\nYour response is a response I'd expect from a friend. 'Feeling down buddy? Come to the skate park? Nope? Cool well I'm going.... bye'\n\n\nOr how about... 'feeling down mate? Play some halo, kill some people with me and talk trash? Nope... your loss'\n\n\nIf I was your gf I'd be pretty pissed too. You're walking a fine line between having a girlfriend and not if you keep it up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Depressed people will often isolate themselves and will often not want your attention either. I'm not saying she's not depressed, I'm not a professional and depression can have a different shape for any single one of us, but she surely sounds like she's trying to put some of her issues on your shoulders, which is never ok. Dealing with her mental issues is not some divine task imposed on you.", "NTA....I would understand her being upset if you went out, but this was online so you were home.  \nYou invited her to join you and your friends. Tried helping her during the week. You still deserve some time for you as well.", "NTA, it's important to have time to do things you enjoy too. You're there for your girlfriend and even offered to let her join. \n\nDepression just really sucks :(", "NTA. I\u2019m miserable so you should be too is toxic af.", "NTA.  She needs help that you cannot provide.  It seems her logic is:  If I am depressed, boyfriend needs to be depressed and by my side.\n\nYou need some soul searching to see if you can continue to love her unconditionally knowing she may be like this for an extended period of time.", "NTA\n\nSo she flaked out bc she was depressed and wanted you to sit and watch? Or am i missing something.", "Why do so many people feel compelled to apologize to AHs just to avoid confrontation? Do you have any idea how much more difficult your life is going to be if this is your typical response to issues like this? Stand up for yourself m8, you have feelings too. By doing this you turn yourself into someone that sets themselves on fire to keep others warm just to avoid a hard conversation. After a while this becomes a part of your personality and you begin to become placating and avoidant. \n\nDefinitely NTA", "NTA - it sounds like you do a lot to support her.  It\u2019s fine that you have some balance in your life by spending time with friends.\n\nBased on what is said, it appears that she is dragging you down rather than your support pulling her up so I find it hard to see what more you can do for her.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not a mind reader. If your gf needs something from you as far as support, she needs to say it plainly.\n\nFurthermore, up until X date, she had plans with her own friends. She knew you had plans. Just because she cancelled her plans because of her mental state and depression, that doesn't mean that your life and your plans are automatically over (unless there is an emergency, of course). To me, this would set a terrible precedent where everything in your life had to revolve around whatever she feels from moment to moment. And that's not a healthy partnership.\n\nAnd the last thing is that your gf needs to make sure that she is getting the support, therapy, and meds she needs to manage her mental health because doing so is a 'her responsibility'.", "This is the first time something like this has happened. She's been sad and depressed but it would be at times where we had nothing going on.", "Shes depressed my dude. That's her problem", "I wanted to tell her she was being unfair, but I thought I'd be in the wrong to start an argument with someone who is feeling depressed. \n\nI do see your point though because I often capitulate when I am actually mad or unhappy when we fight.", "> Depression is suffocating and lonely and feeling like a partner is dismissing your needs/wants to hangout with friends hurts, but unless she clearly asked if you would spend time with her since she\u2019s in such a rough spot this is an unreasonable expectation on her part.\n\nEven if she had, he wouldn't be an asshole for being being unwilling to drop his planned social event to be her emotional support *in that exact moment.* He should consider it, sure. And if it's truly an unusual request or she's in a *crisis*, he might feel compelled to cancel and attend to her. But overall, it's still his right to decide if he should break his social commitment to support her *right then.* OP is still a fully independent person and isn't *just* a tool to soothe his girlfriend when she needs it. It's reasonable for him to want to compromise on attending to the event he put effort into planning, and then carve out time for her later.\n\nDefinite NTA.", "She doesn't have a therapist. We've talked about her getting into therapy before but it's usually an issue with us affording one. She gets a lot of support from her parents but she has expressed being upset with her mom and dad for not giving her more support. I'm not sure what she told her friends so I don't know if they know. \n\nRight now i'm on the line with her mom to see if we can book her two sessions with a therapist.", "With zero sarcasm, what is he supposed to do? Earlier in the week he got her everything she asked for. At this point, is just sitting with her while she slept? My ex suffered from depression and I learned I can help when she asked for help but there were days where she didn\u2019t ask for anything and would be upset that I didn\u2019t provide something that she never actually asked for.", "What is he supposed to do? Carry her fireman style to the hospital and tell them she\u2019s in crisis when she\u2019s not indicated that in any way? \n\nPick her up and throw her at a therapist constantly? \n\nMental health is everyone\u2019s **personal** responsibility. It\u2019s great when people want to support you, but the onus is on you to do the work.", "I don't really think someone with a name like cugehock is giving out good advice.", "I don't fully understand this comment. She communicated with me that she was feeling sad and depressed but I always asked her what I can do for her and her answer was always \"I don't know\" \n\nI genuinely thought hanging out would have been nice and she initially expressed some interest. Now that I have more time to think about it, I think she backed out because she was too tired.", "NAH.   \nShe didn't communicate that she wanted him to not play until later.   \nHer mental health is not his sole responsibility. He is not her medical provider.   \nIt is on her to communicate what she needs. He is not a mind reader.", "Not having one sounds way better than dealing with her depression. Can't help someone that doesn't want to help themselves, sometimes they just want to pull everyone down instead.", "If that\u2019s the case I\u2019d vote NAH. \n\nWe aren\u2019t mind readers, we need to be given more than indirect suggestions to grasp the desires of other people. \n\nShe\u2019s struggling and that sucks, but she needs to be able to communicate that to you more effectively if she wants you to be able to support her in a meaningful way. \n\nIs she looking into supports like therapy or is she just trying to ride it out?", "Don't do that. If you let people walk all over you, they will.", "I understand the impulse, but you aren't either of you any favour by giving in. It will only encourage the behaviour if she gets used to winning every argument just by being upset. It will also likely lead to resentment over time as she may think the argument is done, but you may well still be angry about it.\n\nOverall it is just toxic dynamic to fall into.\n\nAnd in general, speaking as someone who has suffered from depression for over a decade, being depressed doesn't absolve you of responsibility and accountability. Even though she is going through hard times, she still needs to treat you and others with respect.", "She wants to do therapy but as it stands we can't afford it and she wont look into options.", "I know some people who\u2019ve found BetterHelp to be a cost effective support, but opinions seem to vary on experiences and the company itself. \n\nThere are other app/online options that come with more manageable price points than traditional office therapy, but one of the drawbacks can be that they can\u2019t prescribe medication and that\u2019s sometimes necessary for therapy to actually be meaningful. \n\nIt\u2019s understandable that she want support from you and that you want to give it to her, but if she isn\u2019t going to be actively involved in her own recovery it isn\u2019t going to get any better. \n\nOther people can help us, but we have to do the work ourselves to actually be in a better place."]}
