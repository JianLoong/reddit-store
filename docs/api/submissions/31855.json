She shouldn't be taking it out on you. And she was asleep anyway, so it looks like another circumstance where a person is dealing with something they can't directly grapple with, so they project the source of their misery onto the closest target they feel comfortable attacking *because then they are directly grappling with something*.", "NTA. As someone who's struggled with depression - misery loves company, but if you cancel the things that bring you joy, that just makes for two miserable people. There's a balance here ofc - I'm sure she just wants to feel supported, and maybe you can find other ways to do that, based on a conversation around the support she currently needs. But I don't think you did anything wrong here.", "Info:\n\nDoes she have a habit of cancelling her own plans and then expecting you to cancel your own to hang out with her?", "NTA, she changed all her plans, she went to sleep within 30 minutes, what is her problem, did you have to go to bed with her?", "NTA but you need to stand up for yourself. Not just because it's unfair to you, but because giving in and apologising simply because you don't want fight is not a solution and can absolutely ruin a relationship.\n\nYou also need to find better ways to communicate. Let her know that you are there for her, but she needs to communicate what she needs.", "NTA, You had prior commitments and she should understand that she can't ruin your plans cause shes sad. The only thing I could've suggested is to express that she is important to you and you are concerned about her and want to address that after your commitment.", "NTA. This is a miscommunication, mainly owing to her not expressing what she wanted. I'm guessing you're not a mind-reader, so it is up to her to tell you if she is feeling something and wanting something. I'd ask whether this is already a well-established dynamic in which she expects you to spend time with her when she is feeling sad and depressed, to the exclusion of others. \n\nThat said, she's NTA either. She's depressed and she needs help. Does she get counseling? Have you suggested that she do so? You should. And also maybe have a talk about what each of you should do when this situation or a similar one arises.", "NAH, but she does need to communicate needs or expectations better. Depression is suffocating and lonely and feeling like a partner is dismissing your needs/wants to hangout with friends hurts, but unless she clearly asked if you would spend time with her since she\u2019s in such a rough spot this is an unreasonable expectation on her part. Does she have a therapist? What other support is she getting? Do her friends know why she cancelled? You should not be her only support system that will put a huge strain on you both as well as the relationship.", "NTAH.\n\nDepression sucks, and you're there for her offering help.\n\nHowever this doesn't mean you should jeopardize your life and happiness. Especially your social life. Then you're both depressed and that does no-one any good.\n\nShe needs to speak to a professional if she genuinely thinks she is depressed. It's a complicated subject that only she can talk about how/why she feels the way she does.", "Apparently I'm the only one who sees this as a deliberate attempt at manipulation on girlfriend's part. She planned a fun night out with pals, OP was supposed to languish at home, lonely and missing her.

Depressed people will often isolate themselves and will often not want your attention either. I'm not saying she's not depressed, I'm not a professional and depression can have a different shape for any single one of us, but she surely sounds like she's trying to put some of her issues on your shoulders, which is never ok. Dealing with her mental issues is not some divine task imposed on you.", "NTA....I would understand her being upset if you went out, but this was online so you were home.  \nYou invited her to join you and your friends.

She needs help that you cannot provide.

Or am i missing something.", "Why do so many people feel compelled to apologize to AHs just to avoid confrontation? Do you have any idea how much more difficult your life is going to be if this is your typical response to issues like this? Stand up for yourself m8, you have feelings too. By doing this you turn yourself into someone that sets themselves on fire to keep others warm just to avoid a hard conversation.

It\u2019s fine that you have some balance in your life by spending time with friends.\n\nBased on what is said, it appears that she is dragging you down rather than your support pulling her up so I find it hard to see what more you can do for her.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not a mind reader. If your gf needs something from you as far as support, she needs to say it plainly.\n\nFurthermore, up until X date, she had plans with her own friends. She knew you had plans. Just because she cancelled her plans because of her mental state and depression, that doesn't mean that your life and your plans are automatically over (unless there is an emergency, of course). To me, this would set a terrible precedent where everything in your life had to revolve around whatever she feels from moment to moment. And that's not a healthy partnership.\n\nAnd the last thing is that your gf needs to make sure that she is getting the support, therapy, and meds she needs to manage her mental health because doing so is a 'her responsibility'.", "This is the first time something like this has happened. She's been sad and depressed but it would be at times where we had nothing going on.", "Shes depressed my dude.

And if it's truly an unusual request or she's in a *crisis*, he might feel compelled to cancel and attend to her. But overall, it's still his right to decide if he should break his social commitment to support her *right then.* OP is still a fully independent person and isn't *just* a tool to soothe his girlfriend when she needs it. It's reasonable for him to want to compromise on attending to the event he put effort into planning, and then carve out time for her later.\n\nDefinite NTA.", "She doesn't have a therapist. We've talked about her getting into therapy before but it's usually an issue with us affording one.

Earlier in the week he got her everything she asked for. At this point, is just sitting with her while she slept?

If you let people walk all over you, they will.", "I understand the impulse, but you aren't doing either of you any favour by giving in. It will only encourage the behaviour if she gets used to winning every argument just by being upset. It will also likely lead to resentment over time as she may think the argument is done, but you may well still be angry about it.\n\nOverall it is just toxic dynamic to fall into.\n\nAnd in general, speaking as someone who has suffered from depression for over a decade, being depressed doesn't absolve you of responsibility and accountability. Even though she is going through hard times, she still needs to treat you and others with respect.", "She wants to do therapy but as it stands we can't afford it and she wont look into options.", "I know some people who\u2019ve found BetterHelp to be a cost effective support, but opinions seem to vary on experiences and the company itself. \n\nThere are other app/online options that come with more manageable price points than traditional office therapy, but one of the drawbacks can be that they can\u2019t prescribe medication and that\u2019s sometimes necessary for therapy to actually be meaningful. \n\nIt\u2019s understandable that she want support from you and that you want to give it to her, but if she isn\u2019t going to be actively involved in her own recovery it isn\u2019t going to get any better. \n\nOther people can help us, but we have to do the work ourselves to actually be in a better place.", "NTA. What did she want you to do? Feel like shit because she\u2019s feeling like shit?", "I\u2019m assuming you are not a therapist therefore she needs to find one asap and you need to consider a break until she gets help.", "Depends. If your partner is going through a full on mental health crisis,  like suicidality, you have to drop everything to be there. If that's happening like every month, maybe it's time to rethink the relationship. She also didn't ask you to cancel and then got mad at you after, which isn't fair. But if she did say \"Hey I need you. Can you cancel game night?\" and this was a rare occasion, you're not a very a good bf if you chose game night over her mental well being.

There is also room for compromise, like moving gaming to tomorrow or cutting it short by a few hrs so you could spend time with her or check on her.\n\nA lot of the comments telling you you aren't the asshole seem like they are from gamer dudes who are likely single. While you might be \"in the right\", successful relationships aren't about being right all the time: they are about compromise and care, among other things.

She wants your life to revolve around hers, while ignoring your wants\\\\needs. things like that only get worse.", "From the title I was expecting some tactless behavior, or bare minimum well below my standards. My standards, by the way, skew admittedly into borderline unhealthy \"Bend over backwards for loved ones\" direction.\n\nBut honestly, you tried your damn best. You did everything you coudl think of, and communicated with her about how to possibly help. Been there, sucks when you can't help. But that never stops us from trying, right? \n\nAs for the evening, I expected that it was canceled and you still went along with yours. No, she just did not go. You also offered to have her join yours if she wants. You made sure she would not feel excluded. She then opted to go to bed.\n\nMy man, even by my standards that is best possible conduct. You made sure to do right by her at every step. That ain't your girlfriend talking, it is her depression. NTA, Whole heartedly", "NTA \nHer wanting you to be miserable because she is, is not ok or fair. You're allowed to have a good time when she's depressed. You being sad or happy doesn't help or worsen her depression. She's response for managing her own mental health, it's not on you to be a whipping boy because she's unhappy. \n\nI say this as someone with lifelong depression. I have to explain to partners it will be hard on them to not blame themselves for how I feel but it isn't their fault and it's not on them to try and fix how I feel. You did the things you could to make her feel loved. She should have tried to go out with friends and given herself permission to leave after 15 minutes if she's still miserable. Really, she should seek out a therapist to help her with better coping strategies.", "NTA.", "She wasn't owed an apology - but sometimes life is easier with one.\n\nIt was incredibly callous and rude to expect her mood to cancel your plans.

That's selfish.\n\nNTA", "NTA if she wanted you to cancel your thing she should have asked and even still you were under no obligation to.", "NTA \n\nI suffer from a major depression, sometimes have to cancel on friends because of it and it often ends up with me going to bed early. If my (at the moment theoretical) significant other had plans of their own on such a night, I'd be relieved if anything since I'd have one less reason to feel bad for not spending time with them. \n\nShe was sleeping, you would have been in another room anyway. Or did she expect you to stand at attention next to the bed in case she woke up and wanted something? \n\nYes, wanted something, not needed, because unless her depression is bad enough that she needs to be hospitalized, she's fully capable of getting herself a glass of water and/or a light snack. \n\nIf that wasn't the issue, did she simply want to make you as miserable as she felt? \n\nIn any case, don't make the fact that she lives with you turn her completely passive, that will only serve to make her slide even deeper into her depression. I know this from experience, I actually function better living on my own as I have no choice but to get up and do those little things myself, while when I was living with my ex it was easy to just bask in their wish to take care of me and cheer me up.", "Why ? So you can be sad too? No thanks", "NTA, your life doesn\u2019t revolve around when GF gets the feels.", "NTA - Your GF is projecting her emotions onto you, and trying to make you responsible for how \"she feels\" which is super unhealthy.  \n\nPlease have some healthy boundaries around her mental health issues, her depression etc.  You can be supportive and loving -- but the moment she uses her depression to \"control you\", \"berate you\" and \"isolate you\" it becomes unhealthy.    \n\n\nHer moods do not get to dictate YOUR social life, especially when you planned this out in advance and she changed her mind at the last minute.", "NTA.\n\nYou've mentioned leading up to the hangout that you made time and effort to make her feel better. If those one on one time didn't kick her out of her depression, cancelling on your friends on the day of your hangout to spend one on one time with her isn't going to magically knock her out of her depression. I have depression and I know what works for me is knowing someone cares and worries but time and effort is the best way to get rid of those random feelings and bouts of depression. You seem like a good bf, it just was bad luck that one of your plans happened to be during one of her depression days. The best part is you were hanging out with your friends while at home, so you were readily available to assist her as needed. Mind games are not fun so you did the best you could with the best of your efforts and knowledge.", "okay i\u2019ve seen your comments and while yes you don\u2019t wanna kick someone when they\u2019re down, dont let yourself be pushed around because someone else has mental problems. people who are depressed sometimes forget to look outside of their own perspective, so while it could be she\u2019s not realizing her selfishness she needs to understand that she\u2019s not being fair. i mean would she do the same for you? there\u2019s no excuse to not try and find help, there\u2019s cheap options, free options or things that are under healthcare, if not shit start a journal and go over it. there\u2019s no excuse to wallow when you have the resources", "NTA. Replace her with someone less selfish.\n\n\"I'm having a bad day, so EVERYBODY has to have a bad day\".", "Cancelling plans because she\u2019s sad would be a sweet thing to do but not your responsibility in the slightest.

This is a toxic manipulation.  Next comes  \"If you loved me you'd....\"", ">But if she did say \"Hey I need you. Can you cancel game night?\" and this was a rare occasion, you're not a very a good bf if you chose game night over her mental well being. If you can't count on your partner, they really aren't your partner.\n\nSo the days before where OP attended to her don't count as OP prioritizing her? What about the fact that he was able to spend time before and after his meet up with her? \n\nIt would be one thing if they only got to spend the weekend together and this took out a big chunk of their time when she needed him or something, but that's not the case. OP has spent the past few days doing his best to care for her *and* was able to pay attention to her for the rest of the day-it sounds like he had plenty of wiggle room to hang out with his friends for a bit. \n\nAlso, she didn't communicate that she wanted to spend time with him until *after* the hangout, so it's not like OP purposefully ignored her request or anything. Heck, he even says she was sleeping during it. \n\n>My ex ditched me for gaming weekend in a mental health crisis, I served him with a notice to move out of my house when he got home. No regrets.\n\nCongrats, and I mean that genuinely. I think it's important to recognize when a partner doesn't truly care about you and break things off when you deserve better. But I think it's also important to recognize that your partner can't always put you first 24/7, and sometimes they need *their* needs met too. OP taking a bit of time out of one day after spending multiple days doing what he could for his partner does not at all indicate that he doesn't care for her. \n\nAlso, OP never mentions playing any games, just that the hangout was online.", "But she didn't.  She went to sleep. She just doesn't want her partner having fun if she isn't doing something fun too. NTA", "They had one on one time.", "I think she was being unfair as well. While it\u2019s normal to expect some support from your partner when you\u2019re going through a rough patch, you were doing that and being a good partner from the sound of it. Being supportive doesn\u2019t mean cancelling all of your plans and becoming a hermit. You have been making time for her outside of a planned event. She shouldn\u2019t ask you to cancel \u2014 your emotional needs matter too. It sounds like her behaviors are somewhat toxic", "Her depression is not a reason or excuse to treat you badly. Being depressed may not be her fault but it is her responsibility to deal with. You are not her emotional support animal, therapist, or punching bag. And you should not have to cancel your plans just because she decided to cancel hers.", "LOL, simple but true.", "I don't think we have enough information to say that's what's going on.

Do you not see the problem with that?", "Affording one can definitely be tricky, but if you can make it work i would recommend it. Have you talked about what \u201csupport\u201d looks like for her? it can be different things for different people, maybe she isn\u2019t getting support in a way that works even if people are trying to help. It also sounds like she might be taking her depression out on people close to her because their support hasn\u2019t made it go away (it won\u2019t. it helps but it won\u2019t make it go away)", "We definitely have enough to know she was asked several times if she wanted him to do anything, but then she gets upset when he didn't read her mind and cancel something he was looking forward to.  That's straight up toxic, and it's not too much of a stretch to see what direction that leads.", "You don't have to go to therapy to get prescribed anti depressant.
