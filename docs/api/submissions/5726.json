I wouldn't even judge her if later on, when she and OP were alone, she'd said something like \"I'm so glad you loved the gift Sarah got you, and it was a really nice moment between you two. But honestly, I also felt a little sad because you've never reacted that way when I've given you a gift.\" This lady clearly never learned the toddler-level lesson of \"It's okay to be upset, it's not okay to hurt other people because you're upset.\"", "NTA but you need a new GF. Any woman who considers a mans daughter as competition, is not a good woman. She is literally stabbing you in the eyes with her red flags...\n\nI had a Dad who cared more about his GF/New Wife than his kids and it took her DYING (35 years later) for my dad to apologize for his behaviour and not being part of our lives.", "Dump her already, it's bound to happen.", "Your teenage daughter got you a gift and your adult girlfriend is jealous? \n\nAre you sure your girlfriend is an actual adult and not a 15 year old in a trench coat?\n\nNTA unless you don\u2019t have a talk with your girlfriend about basic common decency.", "NTA. Please break up with this woman. To be jealous of your daughter is appalling and it's compounded with the silent treatment and expectation that you \"fix\" it. The only way to fix this is to end the relationship before she starts hurting your daughter.", "Are you sure your daughter is the stroppy teenager in this situation? Because GF is certainly doing a brilliant impersonation of one! \n\nNTA. She's a grown woman jealous of a child. She's a grown woman who puts minimal effort into gift giving but expects maximum response and gratitude. Your bar is low, mate.", "NTA.   Your gf being that jealous of your daughter is a big concern. That is a major overreaction.   Red flag.", "INFO: I\u2019m really curious about the age difference because your girlfriend is acting very mature and like her and your daughter are contemporaries.", "NTA, red flag, get rid", "NTA she is jealous of your daughter which is a huge red flag \ud83d\udea9 don\u2019t let her around her because if you guys get married she will definitely bully your daughter", "Rethink this relationship. If she's already jealous of your daughter as your girlfriend what will she be like if you marry her? NTA", "NTA. But why is your girlfriend jealous of your daughter? That's gross.", "Congratulations OP, your gf is less emotionally mature than a teenager! \n\nNTA - but you will be if you don\u2019t address the issue of your GF being threatened by a healthy relationship between you and your daughter.", "NTA. I would ask your daughter if your GF has mistreated her. GF\u2019s reaction was not normal.", "NTA your gf is jealous of your daughter", "Right?\n\nLike\u2026how dare you be happy about a gift you got for Christmas- don\u2019t you know you\u2019re only allowed to actually like GFs gifts?/s\n\nGirlfriends got issues. She\u2019s acting like your freaking daughter is the \u2018other woman\u2019. Ugh\u2026\n\nNTA- you got a gift that you liked- you responded accordingly. Why your girlfriend  can only tolerate your happiness if it\u2019s specifically about her feels pretty red flag-ish to me.", "NTA I would absolutely disengage from this conversation. Grey roll all the way", "NTA, how will you fix her shity behavior?", "red flag alert. she's jealous of your daughter and expects you to fix... :checks notes: what exactly? that you had a bonding moment with your child?? no way  \n\n\nNTA", "For your daughter\u2019s sake, and your sanity\u2019s\u2026dump her. NTA, but you will be if you continue apologizing to her and potentially ruining this for your daughter.", "NTA\n\nBut I think, contrary to most people here, she **isn't** jealous of your daughter. She is jealous of **how you reacted and the excitement you showed** to her present and she feels you don't appreciate what she does because you were never that happy when she gives/makes you something. \n\nSome people have a hard time showing appreciation or excitement over a gift or am act of service, etc, I am one of those people. I've also realized that that show of emotion and excitement is very **valuable** to some people. I've talked about it with friends and most people can't really explain why and felt kind of bad for putting so much meaning in the reaction of a person because they do know they loved it, it's just nice to **see** their reaction and it makes people feel appreciated. Your gf is probably having a hard time expressing herself and she should work on that. \n\nHowever, I would like you to think if you usually show this much emotion and appreciation to things that she does or you don't because you kind of expect it because she always does it for you. She appears to be extremely hurt by that.", "NTA. Why is your girlfriend competing with your daughter in her head? That's weird.", "NTA", "You need to break up with your girlfriend if she\u2019s gonna act that entitled and jealous. 2 days of ignoring you because you got excited about an unexpected gift?? The fuck?", "NTA You were happy and touched by a gift your daughter got you for Christmas and your gf had a fit of jealousy and is arguing with you and not speaking to you for displaying happiness? You need to be very careful here. She can quickly isolate you from your family and that she gets mad that you display any positive feelings for anything not involving her. She will never make a decent step mother and she will be an exhausting partner. You will find yourself doing things you shouldn't just to not 'rock the boat' and 'keep the peace'.", "Exactly this!!", "This. If she is that put out because you were delighted with a very nice gift from your daughter, this will never end. She will compare herself to you daughter AT EVERY TURN. You and she need therapy. NTA", "He could fix it by dumping her jealous ass. Then she won't need to be jealous of any gifts he receives.\n\nI don't normally agree with just dumping people off the bat but this reeks of GF is going to be a vicious stepmother who attempts to separate op from his daughter.", "It's also a really beautiful sign of maturity from the daughter - a genuinely thoughtful gift. I bet OP is really proud as well as touched. I would be! And it's kind of baffling to me that gf doesn't get that.", "Yes, of course the surprise factor is important. But if he doesn't show appreciation to his gf efforts and had this explosive happiness and reaction over his daughter's gift, it may make her feel like he doesn't appreciate the things she does."]}
