INFO: are you normally dismissive of what your GF gets you?  I would be hurt if you were normally a jerk when you get a gift from me but then pull out a \"miracle\" when someone else gets you something. Not discounting what the daughter gave, but am saying if you are normally unappreciative it  shows that you are capable of more.", "NTA. Dump the gf. This is not the future you want.

I learned this one the hard way, after my former partner escalated.", "NTA \n\nIt's joyus when our children get us something unexpected. No matter what it is. It's just special because they chose it for us.\n\nYour girlfriend is an asshole for being jealous of your teen daughter.\n\nWhy in the world some people view their  SO's children as rivals or competition blows my mind.

Your relationship with your GF is kind of doomed, if you ask me.   Find a way to end it.", "NTA\n\nYour girlfriend being jealous of your daughter is concerning.

So much conflict over a supposedly family holiday\u2026\n\nBut, you\u2019re NTA. Of course you would be happy with a surprise gift from your teenager - and it was something that matches your interests showing she put thought into it, so double happies all round except of course for your GF who seems weirdly competitive with your daughter.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is being somewhat childish. Your reaction to your daughter's present is understandable.", "NAH - it's reasonable to be excited that your daughter got you a thoughtful gift, and your girlfriend may genuinely feel that you take her gifts for granted.\n\nYou two should discuss love languages.  I suspect that underlying this issue is that you appreciate the thought more than the actual gift.  Your daughter got you something thoughtful, whereas your girlfriend gets you things you ask for (no thought).  If you love receiving thoughtful gifts, tell your girlfriend that you would appreciate a thoughtful surprise, even if it's inexpensive, more than something you asked for.", "Light ESH, leaning towards NTA\n\nIn the actual situation, your aren\u2019t TA. You were excited because your kid got you a gift, and they usually don\u2019t. Your girlfriend always does, so you aren\u2019t going to be as surprised. People also tend to act more excited to younger people when receiving gifts because it\u2019s not as expected and because, well, they\u2019re kids.\n\nHowever, saying your girlfriend asks what you want and just says \u201chere you go\u201d is completely unnecessary. Most people ask their loved ones what they want as to not give them something they don\u2019t want. Give her options if you want a surprise.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your girlfriend got upset that you were excited and happy. Even worse, your gf was upset that YOUR DAUGHTER made you happy. Red flag city. Even if she's just upset at the lack of reaction to her past gifts, gifts aren't supposed to be about the reaction you get from giving them. And she's upset you didn't apologize/fix...what? Your emotions? Your happy emotions for your daughter? Yikes for her attitude", "NTA There is no issue to be solved here other than your gf's immaturity and jealousy of your kid.  Of course you were excited.  Your kid independently got you a gift and even better, a gift that shows she knows what you like. The real issue is you having a woman in your life that behaves like a jealous teen.  That is bad for you and very bad for your daughter.  This time she is giving you the silent treatment but sooner or later she is going to do the same thing to your daughter.  Are you going to allow that to happen?", "NTA. Getting jealous over a gift you loved from YOUR DAUGHTER is a huge problem. It started that way with my ex husband and our oldest 15 at the time. He did not talk to her for mo because of his gf. Tread forward careful.", "NTA, your gf is a petty jerk for being upset that you liked a gift from your kid!\n\nWhy are you with someone who will punish you for days over something so innocent?", "3) It\u2019s not only not a problem, it\u2019s not \u201cfixable\u201d. What does she want, him to call his daughter and be like \u201cjust kidding, I actually hate what you got me\u201d?", "> She needs help.\n\nI agree with this, but I think what *OP* needs is to get out of this relationship rather than sticking around to try to help. The silent treatment is abuse, particularly when the person didn't do anything wrong.", "Facts. The real problem is her."]}
