Your reaction to your daughter's present is understandable.", "NAH - it's reasonable to be excited that your daughter got you a thoughtful gift, and your girlfriend may genuinely feel that you take her gifts for granted.\n\nYou two should discuss love languages.  I suspect that underlying this issue is that you appreciate the thought more than the actual gift.  Your daughter got you something thoughtful, whereas your girlfriend gets you things you ask for (no thought).  If you love receiving thoughtful gifts, tell your girlfriend that you would appreciate a thoughtful surprise, even if it's inexpensive, more than something you asked for.", "Light ESH, leaning towards NTA\n\nIn the actual situation, your aren\u2019t TA. You were excited because your kid got you a gift, and they usually don\u2019t. Your girlfriend always does, so you aren\u2019t going to be as surprised. People also tend to act more excited to younger people when receiving gifts because it\u2019s not as expected and because, well, they\u2019re kids.\n\nHowever, saying your girlfriend asks what you want and just says \u201chere you go\u201d is completely unnecessary.
