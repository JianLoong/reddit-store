Let's call her Natalie (23F). Natalie and I have been friends for a while, but we haven't been able to hang out as much since she graduated last year and has been working. This was my first time seeing her new place, and our first time spending the night together (before anyone gets the wrong idea, there are absolutely no romantic or sexual feelings between us). \n\nNow, as a guy without a penis I am unable to enjoy the wonders of pissing standing up most of the time. STPs scare me and so I simply sit. However, when I shower I can pee however I'd like and it just goes down the drain and washes off my leg if I aim badly! I shower every night before bed and I basically always pee, it's just really satisfying for me. I don't really talk to my friends about my peeing habits, but my whole family pees in the shower as well and I just assumed it was normal.\n\nLast week, me and Natalie were hanging out with some of our friends. Somehow, we started talking about peeing, and so of course peeing in the shower came up. Many of my penisless friends agreed with me that it's so nice to be able to stand for once, and many of my penis-having friends even agreed as well. However, not everyone felt that way, and there was a bit of an awkward silence afterwards.\n\nNatalie approached me later and nervously asked me if I had peed in her shower, and I said yes. She got really quiet and the whole thing got really awkward. She kinda shuffled away and we sort of avoided each other the rest of the evening. Later, one of our mutual friends texted me to tell me Natalie was really uncomfortable to learn that I peed in her shower, and she was reconsidering whether she would ever let me stay with her again. I texted her about it directly and apologized, but she hasn't replied yet.\n\nSo AITA for peeing in her shower?", "created_utc": 1693179913, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16362zh/aita_for_peeing_in_my_friends_shower/", "score": 2202, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you pee in someone else's shower, they have to clean it.\n\nI'm gonna give a simple example. If you stayed at our place and peed in our shower, first of all all of it won't go down the drain and it'll gather bacteria in the shower. Ever seen that red stuff gathering around the drain and sides of the shower? That's bacteria. It usually doesn't come as fast if no one pees in there but it'll come anyway due to stuff being showered off bodies and moisture, but it becomes worse with pee.\n\nAdditionally we have a drain with a little bucket in it that gathers hair and such in the floor, our shower, sink and washer is connected to it. If someone pees, c\"ms, spits, sheds etc it'll collect in this bucket and eventually it smells like a septic tank if not cleaned in detail. I clean this bucket once every two weeks and I'll see and smell everything people have flushed down the sink and shower.\n\nSo personally I'd want people to not pee in the shower or sink especially since we have a functioning toilet for that.

Might not seem like a big deal now, but when you're 60 and experience pelvic floor dysfunction, like roughly half of biological females will, it's a nightmare to un-train. Is the relief of today worth decades of diapers later?\n\nSecond applies solely to those who are biologically female at birth. They can not physically fully relax the pelvic muscles while standing. Not even with a leg up. Many Americans pee wrong, and use accessory muscles to 'push' urine instead of letting the bladder relax and fold out like it it supposed to. It's the reason so many will suffer pelvic floor dysfunction. Using muscles to push out urine while standing is even worse, and never fully empties the bladder... which leads to all sorts of unfortunate annoyances like infection.", "Clearly there is a divide between those that do not pee in the shower and those that do.

It gets *visible,* and it's already problematic before it's visible, and putting other people in the position of walking bare-foot on your urine(/urinary residue) is disgusting. And by the way, for persons with female anatomy, there's also a physical health reason not to pee standing up: it weakens your pelvic floor, which can put you on a path to incontinence. Which is a hassle you should not want.  \n\nI want to give people the benefit of the doubt here because all children pee in the shower (warm water naturally inclines the human body toward that, same reason for the old sleeping-hand-in-the-bowl prank), and while many parents are knowledgable and responsible enough to teach their kids proper hygiene, some parents clearly lack either the knowledge or inclination to teach their kids rock-bottom-basics like \"don't pee in the shower\". But since it's coming up in a public forum... I'm sorry you guys, but your parents failed to teach you something that they SHOULD have taught you, and many people's parents did teach them and those other people WILL be grossed out about you if they realize you're violating this as an adult: Don't pee in the shower. It's like \"don't pee in the pool\".\n\nYuck.

Like just because you do something weird and it's normal in your family or whatever, doesn't mean everybody in the world does that specific weird thing.", "How is peeing in the shower gross but the very act of showering isn't?\n\nYour body is far dirtier than your piss.", "As opposed to poop particles?", "There are things people can control and things people can\u2019t control.  We clean up as best when using the bathroom. But to deliberately release a stream of pee that will mostly wash away but also splash on walls that don\u2019t necessarily get rinsed is gross. And to do this in someone else\u2019s home is unacceptable. I don\u2019t know why people can\u2019t pee before the shower or wait ten minutes until they are done.  Exercise some self control.", "Bro it's something OP's been doing ever since. It is something normal to OP. When you shower and feel it coming you just let go. There is no thinking it is muscle memory by then. OP even apologized for it. NTA. But the friend's reaction is also understandable.", "that legit makes no sense, it doesnt harm the shower or you, why should you not do it", "But, peeing is part of showering for most people, and most people don't change their showering habits when they use a different shower? \n\nIs it disgusting or \"straight up weird\" to wash your ass in someone else's shower? Cause that is just as \"unsanitary\" if not more. \n\nIt's a fucking shower. It cleans you.", "Shower is not always a clean place. You can be really dirty when you get in the shower. You place your dirty feet there, your period blood gets all over the shower making it look like a horror movie scene, you wash your ass there. Showers are not sterile, a little pee is not going to make any difference. Also, you pee in the beginning of your shower. Then you wash yourself with soap. There will be no pee left in the shower at the end. It's cool to pee in the shower because you are saving water (instead of peeing in the toilet and having to flush).", "Yeah\u2026 can OP shower after playing a game of football/sport covered in mud and sweat? That seems way grosser to me but I think most people would be fine with that. \n\nBut I also thought most people would be fine with peeing in the shower so idk anymore", "These are the same people who probably use toilet paper to smear their shit all over themselves and then seem repulsed by the idea of a <gasp> bidet.", "Go stick your feet into a urinal then, since the pee just get washed away anyways", "Why waste the extra water of flushing the loo when you can just let it wash down a drain while you\u2019re already showering? I\u2019d be more mad about people adding unnecessarily to my water bill.", "No one does. Literally no one here is talking about that. You have to take a shower, you also have to piss, so instead of using the toilet and then the shower you take care of it at the beginning of the shower you're taking anyway.", "same here, unless they're like, aiming up the walls or something lmao\n\n\naltho I'm one of the weirdos that gets out of the shower to pee in the toilet rather than just peeing in the shower \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "right? I'm actually in awe of just how many people have no problem peeing themselves \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nI think there would have to be some extreme circumstances for me to just pee down my leg \ud83d\ude06\n\nalthough, this comes second to the post from a while back where bunch of people claimed that 'everyone pees in pools' and that is normal.... sooo I'm not stepping in no pools or other people's showers any time soon", "No, because that dirt is definitely not as much as a whole bladderful of urine. Piss in your own shower, not someone else's. What the fuck why isn't this common decency.", "I'm with u 100", "You can't be this dense. The bias on this sub is very clear. If this was a biological male he would be ripped to shreds.", "Maybe not in this particular case, but on this sub yeah, they really do.", "Stupid there and stupid here", "Well then, she\u2019s also showering in her friend\u2019s hair, sweat, poop, and any dirt from her body. Except that\u2019s not how showers work - the dirt, etc., washes down the drain.", "It's a shower... It self cleans piss. You guys realize the stuff he is washing off his body is worse than piss right?", "I don't know about others, but I usually wipe the shower cabin clean after I use it - makes regular bathroom maintenance this much easier and quicker! (No real scrubbing, but make sure that soap residue etc. is gone, no hair in the drain of course, that kind of stuff.)", "How do we know it wasn\u2019t cleaned..? Friend never even knew u til the convo was brought up.", "What?! OP\u2019s friend never would\u2019ve known if it wasn\u2019t brought up in conversation. The pee literally washes away into the drain along with all the other soapy dirt and grim in the water. Any area that receives a constant flow of water from the shower head is self-cleaning. You\u2019re acting like OP left a puddle of piss in the tub that the friend stepped in.", "I've had showers with drainage issues and showers with uneven bases so water would sit in like a tiny pool.\n\nI'm not about to risk my friends shower being one of those by peeing in it.", "Ew, he put his dirty hands all over my nice clean soap!!", "I don't see the practicality of doing that, but if you have the habit of cleaning the toilet often and thoroughly (as you should) then there should be no harm if (for whatever very specific reason you think somebody would have to do it) you need to.\n\nAlso, can we simply try to have an intellectually honest discussion about this? No matter what you do, the surfaces of your shower receive all types of body fluids, and then they dilute in several gallons and water and soap, which normally contains antibacterial compounds. That's what showers do. And sweat, piss, feces, semen, vaginal fluid, menstruation... You are supposed to clean all of these fluids that your body naturally produces away, alongside other nasty external residues that come from simply existing indoors and outdoors. That's literally what you are doing every time you take a shower. You can try to think away from this fact as much as you want, but that won't change the fact that your body produces these substances and that your shower is full of these particles, whether you like it or not. To think otherwise is naive at best and delusional at worst.", "Wtf is wrong with you. It's pee literally pee, you're washing away dead skin, gems, dirt, sweat, literally everything you've come in contact with that day hell sometimes blood which is so much more unhygienic considering blood born illnesses exist but you're 100% okay with that, but you draw the line at pee....", "Because the friend is the one who has to clean it? I don't care about pissing in my shower because I'm the one who has to get on my knees and scrub it. But cleaning my shower after knowing my friend has pissed in it? I mean yeah, I'm obviously not cleaning straight piss, but it's still a nasty thought", "no chlorine gas is released unless you mix it with an acid such as vinegar.  which every bottle will warn you not to do.", "Post-COVID brain is a hell of a thing to witness", "When we know better, we do better. \n\nOr pee in the shower.", "And people say we don't need math after high school! \n\nI think you underestimate people's ability to multitask while peeing if their hands are free.", "Well I mean same thing when you flush a toilet? Do you offer to clean someone\u2019s bathroom every time you flush after using a toilet? Even if you close the lid before you flush there are some aerosolised particles floating around", "Flushing the toilet aerosolizes all *sorts* of stuff. Are you suggesting that he should just hold it until he goes home?", "Gah yeah I'm also freaked out about the pool thing! I can't trust humanity in anything anymore \ud83d\ude05", "Seems like a lot of people are agreeing it's gross though", "You know that you have to clean showers, right?", "Well here\u2019s the truth. It doesn\u2019t wash away. Ever shared a shower? The stink and slime of the previous occupant is splattered everywhere. You might as well be rolling in their dirty pubes.", "I\u2019m starting to think most of these people don\u2019t know how showers work.", "It's... a-me *sighs*, Mario...", "i understood that reference lol", "Then don't piss on yourself....", "You can take a shit on command? Tell me you're god's favourite without telling me you're god's favourite. I fucking wish with my IBS.", "Yes but not the majority. For the majority opinion, see top voted comment.", "Everytime someone uses it though?", "Your mother had people pee in her shower for years and never knew.", "Actually. A ton of soaps have antibacterial in them, and you actually want some good bacteria on your hands, so it\u2019s harder for invasive bacteria to colonize. Not going to cause issues to breath like some pretty heavy cleaning chemicals, but wanted to add this perspective", "So then wouldn\u2019t just washing your genitals in the shower spread this bacteria and not the actual pee? I don\u2019t have a horse in this race because I\u2019ve never peed in someone else\u2019s shower, but it is sorta funny to be grossed out by pee in the shower but not someone scrubbing their ass in the shower (which hopefully everyone is doing)", "So does your entire body. Do you wash your ass in the shower?\n\nThat has far more bacteria."]}
