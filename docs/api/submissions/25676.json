Let's call her Natalie (23F). Natalie and I have been friends for a while, but we haven't been able to hang out as much since she graduated last year and has been working. This was my first time seeing her new place, and our first time spending the night together (before anyone gets the wrong idea, there are absolutely no romantic or sexual feelings between us). \n\nNow, as a guy without a penis I am unable to enjoy the wonders of pissing standing up most of the time. STPs scare me and so I simply sit. However, when I shower I can pee however I'd like and it just goes down the drain and washes off my leg if I aim badly! I shower every night before bed and I basically always pee, it's just really satisfying for me. I don't really talk to my friends about my peeing habits, but my whole family pees in the shower as well and I just assumed it was normal.\n\nLast week, me and Natalie were hanging out with some of our friends. Somehow, we started talking about peeing, and so of course peeing in the shower came up. Many of my penisless friends agreed with me that it's so nice to be able to stand for once, and many of my penis-having friends even agreed as well. However, not everyone felt that way, and there was a bit of an awkward silence afterwards.\n\nNatalie approached me later and nervously asked me if I had peed in her shower, and I said yes. She got really quiet and the whole thing got really awkward. She kinda shuffled away and we sort of avoided each other the rest of the evening. Later, one of our mutual friends texted me to tell me Natalie was really uncomfortable to learn that I peed in her shower, and she was reconsidering whether she would ever let me stay with her again. I texted her about it directly and apologized, but she hasn't replied yet.\n\nSo AITA for peeing in her shower?", "created_utc": 1693179913, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16362zh/aita_for_peeing_in_my_friends_shower/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you pee in someone else's shower, they have to clean it.\n\nI'm gonna give a simple example. If you stayed at our place and peed in our shower, first of all all of it won't go down the drain and it'll gather bacteria in the shower. Ever seen that red stuff gathering around the drain and sides of the shower? That's bacteria. It usually doesn't come as fast if no one pees in there but it'll come anyway due to stuff being showered off bodies and moisture, but it becomes worse with pee.\n\nAdditionally we have a drain with a little bucket in it that gathers hair and such in the floor, our shower, sink and washer is connected to it. If someone pees, c\"ms, spits, sheds etc it'll collect in this bucket and eventually it smells like a septic tank if not cleaned in detail. I clean this bucket once every two weeks and I'll see and smell everything people have flushed down the sink and shower.\n\nSo personally I'd want people to not pee in the shower or sink especially since we have a functioning toilet for that.

Might not seem like a big deal now, but when you're 60 and experience pelvic floor dysfunction, like roughly half of biological females will, it's a nightmare to un-train. Is the relief of today worth decades of diapers later?\n\nSecond applies solely to those who are biologically female at birth. They can not physically fully relax the pelvic muscles while standing. Not even with a leg up. Many Americans pee wrong, and use accessory muscles to 'push' urine instead of letting the bladder relax and fold out like it it supposed to. It's the reason so many will suffer pelvic floor dysfunction. Using muscles to push out urine while standing is even worse, and never fully empties the bladder... which leads to all sorts of unfortunate annoyances like infection.", "Clearly there is a divide between those that do not pee in the shower and those that do.
