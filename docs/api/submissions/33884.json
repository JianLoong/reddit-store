Tim alternates one week with his dad and another with my brother and Kate.\n\nI agreed to babysit Olivia today while my brother and Kate run some errands for 5-6 hours. Tim was supposed to be with his dad. The night before, Kate called and asked me to watch Tim as well as there was some emergency at his dad\u2019s and he dropped Tim off at her place. Kate said Tim would be fine just watching some movies and then a nap. As long as I stick to this routine there should be no problem. She would provide the movies and the snacks he was comfortable to eat.\n\nThe thing was, I planned to take Kate to a cafe she told me she wanted to visit. It was supposed to be a surprise. Having to stay home with Tim would greatly change the flow of our day. In addition, I have met Tim like twice and don\u2019t know him well. I have no experience with special needs kids and didn\u2019t think I was equipped to look after one. Due to these reasons, I refused to babysit Tim. I told them I could only take Olivia as previously agreed.\n\nMy brother and Kate called me AH for not helping out. They told me an extra kid costed me almost nothing while their only other option was to bring Tim to Kate\u2019s mom who can\u2019t drive and lives almost an hour away.\n\n They still brought Olivia over and we had a great time. They picked up Olivia 2 hours later than they were supposed to and Tim was crying. My brother and Kate said all this could be prevented had I just help out because Tim would be relaxing at my place instead of stuck in traffic and getting cranky. \n\nI just told them emergencies happen and I really was not ready to be their plan B.

A whole host of things could\u2019ve gone wrong, and I\u2019m sure if they did your brother and his wife would be quick to point the finger at you despite it being their fault for pushing you into it.", "NTA - so satisfying that OP refused, had great boundaries and had a great day.  Really shady that Kate said OP was playing favorites when Olivia has been in her life for 10 years and she's met Tim twice.  Yes, people do play favorites with people they've known for ten years over someone they've barely met.  That's kind of a given.", "NTA. No, you are not in the wrong here. It was responsible of you to consider the potential risks and limitations of caring for a child with special needs, especially without any prior experience or preparation. Your concern for Tim's well-being and safety is valid, as a meltdown or a potentially dangerous situation could have arisen if you were unprepared. Your brother and Kate should have made alternate arrangements for Tim or communicated with you earlier about the change in plans. It is unfair for them to guilt-trip you and expect you to prioritize their needs over your own.", "You're NTA now, but you could be one if you don't take this opportunity to learn how to take care of Tim.", "You were unfamiliar with him or his needs, and he was unfamiliar with you. Emergencies happen, but they need to have pre-existing arrangements with people who are acquainted with and prepared to care for him. NTA", "NTA Tim isn't your problem. You agreed to take care of Olivia (Your NIECE) and had plans that didnt include staying home watching babyshows with a kid that isn't your problem", "NTA they should have cancelled their plans. You need to have the opportunity to spend more time with Tim so he gets to know you and is comfortable with you before they ever decide to leave him with you, if you agree to watch him in the future. Selfish on their part.", "NTA", "NTA\nYou had agreed on something, and while emergencies happen you had plans for some quality time with your niece. You weren't required to change that to just be stuck in the house with two kids for hours \n\nKate saying that is just trying to make you feel guilty - and we don't like manipulative in-laws. You literally basically don't know that child, of course your niece is your priority ! also you haven't interacted with him enough to be comfortable watching him for hours", "NTA - even if you were inclined to do child care for Tim, this instance wouldn't be the best way to do it for the first time, with no warning or prep, for several hours, with no backup in case it went wrong. For me, I'm gonna need that to be a real emergency along the lines of \"someone is in the hospital and it's serious please help\".\n\nBased on how they're acting, I'd be sus that a strange person having the kid in a strange place without having all his things or his safe foods wouldn't be as easy as just plopping him in front of the tv. They prob just prefer to think it's just that easy because they aren't there to see the meltdown you would've been dealing with, whereas being in the car with the crying child makes it their problem.", "NTA.  She had a plan B and it was inconvenient.  Plan C is that she cancels her errands.  Plan D  is she tells her kid\u2019s dad that she\u2019s unavailable to take him.  She has plenty of choices other than volunteering you without consent.  You agreed to watch one child, not two.  If your brother was so concerned he could have watched him but they decided that their plans are more important than yours.  I see a couple of assholes in this story and it\u2019s not you.", "I\u2019m sure Olivia really appreciated a day/activity just for her instead of always having to take a back seat to her brother. \n\nNTA", "If it was so bad for Tim to be in the car or whatever, why didn't they cancel their plans? Errands do not constitute an emergency.\n\nYou are not their employee.

You are not picking favourites and it is up to his parents to make alternative arrangements.", "Good for you -- you did exactly the right thing. Your brother and his wife clearly think you are an idiot pushover and they intend to use and abuse your good nature. \n\nThis was not your emergency, and it wasn't even theirs -- it doesn't take 2 people 5-6 hours to \"run errands\". One could stay home with the boy, or they could hire a qualified sitter experienced with special needs. For them to call you an A H when you are doing a treat for your niece should tell you everything you need to know about them. \n\nDo not be guilted into this. This is in no way your responsibility and can even be a disaster with a child you do not know. Also, you are under no obligation to get to know him. Their life choices do not become your burden, and this boy is no relation to you. \n\nA day with your niece is one thing. This was your brother trying to avoid his own responsibilities at your expense -- quite quite different. And the nerve of saying an extra child was no expense to you! \n\nHold your line.: you're proudly NTA.", "NTA in that you aren't obligated to take care of any children other than your own, but special needs children do have feelings too and eventually you'll either have to decide to single them out with a lack of equivalent attention or you'll need to learn how to deal with them.  So not knowing how to deal with him is definitely something you should make a decision about", "NTA.  Without the proper training/knowledge it would be dangerous for everyone if you watched Tim.  What if he had a meltdown?  What if he started hurting himself?  What if he panics and runs?  You're not able to care for him.  Fuck Kate and your brother for putting their convenience above his safety.  Fuck them for treating Olivia as a glass child.  Please stay in touch and keep insisting on doing things with just her.  Maybe you'll be able to get to know Tim better and spend time with him.  But don't let your brother and Kate always force you to take both of them if that happens.", "NTA. Autistic kids thrive on routine, and them trying to tell you that a major disruption in routine would be no big deal to him is disingenuous at best. Knowing what you\u2019re comfortable with and prepared for is wise here. Don\u2019t let them guilt you, it\u2019s entirely likely he would have been freaked out at your place, too.", "Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if they always planned to have you watch Tim and just were going to spring it on you when they figured you couldn't say no. If you barely know this kid you are not the right person to watch him. I would not watch a kid who was likely to have a meltdown due to being around a person he barely knows in a strange place, ever. NTA", "NTA. A special needs kid in a new place with someone they don't know well is a recipe for  disaster.  You did the right thing.", "NTA \n\n\u201cIf you stick to his routine he\u2019ll be fine\u201d \u201cif he\u2019d stay with you he\u2019d be relaxing and all of this could\u2019ve been avoided\u201d bullshit. He does not know you, he does not know your home. His distress at being in a car with his safe people (his parents) would\u2019ve paled in comparison to the distress of him being in an entirely new environment with a person he barely knows/doesn\u2019t know at all. Even if you decided to to purposefully ignore that fact there\u2019s no way you would\u2019ve been able to adhere to his routine to a T. You wouldn\u2019t have his favorite cup, plate, safe foods, etc. you also aren\u2019t a babysitter you would not have been able to manage his routine and caring for your niece the way his mom would have. She\u2019s lying through her teeth to get her way. She thinks you\u2019re too stupid to understand this, and that so long as she says it\u2019ll be okay that you\u2019ll believe her. \n\nThey had plenty of other options that didn\u2019t include you. Not taking him from her ex on his time was one of them, getting a babysitter they\u2019ve used in the past is another, going to her mother as they\u2019ve mentioned, or pushing back their plans another day. Which brings me to there\u2019s no errand that lasts 6 hours that requires 2 adults and no children around whatsoever. They made plans to spend the day together, and after accepting responsibility for her son for the day instead of planning accordingly she decided it would be better to be selfish distrupt her son, put him at risk, intrude on her daughters special time, and harass someone untrained and unaware of how to scare for a special needs child to do so and care for their other child as well at the same time so she can have mommy daddy time. Fuck that, you made the right decision. For you, for your niece, and for him. She just can\u2019t see it because she\u2019s so focused on what she wanted, fuck what it costed anyone else. \n\nHaving special needs kids is hard yes, but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to pawn that responsibility on to other people because you personally feel it\u2019s owed to you. This also has jack shit to do with biological connection, if they had a special needs child together you\u2019d have been in the same predicament and responded the same, because it\u2019s not blood that\u2019s the issue it\u2019s the extra needs, liability, and responsibility. I\u2019m also willing to bet she pushed for this as hard as she did because she knows once she can force you into it once, she can do it again and again. She doesn\u2019t see you as a person Independent from them with your own needs, responsibilities, and limitations. Maybe before, but now that you\u2019re close that\u2019s out the window. Because all she can see is someone she can drop her son with on a whim when it tickles her fancy. You handled this 100% correctly, she\u2019ll likely try again and continue to respond the same. She\u2019ll call names, guilt trip, gaslight, and emotionally manipulate to get her way. Let her, and if need be set stronger boundaries. \n\nShe\u2019ll eventually learn that she can\u2019t force her will on you, and that her wants don\u2019t supersede yours. She just has to try her luck enough times to learn you\u2019re not the one, and your living close changes nothing when it comes to her day to day or responsibilities. I\u2019d continue to try to spend time with your niece though, she needs the connection. Children who are siblings of special needs are forced to grow up quickly, they also tend to be emotionally neglected. Not always severely but enough that they need a safe person they can talk to freely and forget about it all. That said, I am going to warn you there\u2019s a possibility she may try to weaponize your niece to get her way. I know it\u2019s going to be hard but let her, do what you can to fill your time in the interim and do not break. Eventually she\u2019ll realize she\u2019s only making her life harder by doing so. Because instead of getting help with one, she\u2019s getting help with none in her greedy attempt to push for more than you can reasonably handle  (I don\u2019t mean emotionally btw, although that\u2019s absolutely true. There\u2019s a lot of issues than can and will arise that you will not know how to handle and that will leave you liable in every sense of the word.) So if that happens stay strong, reaffirm your boundaries, and force space if she grows volatile.", "NTA. And you were not the Plan B and he is not your family and I would not babysit an autistic child that I only met twice.", "NTA. \nYou had a special day planned with your niece... and no, you don't view a child you've met twice as family...", "Why didn\u2019t Tim\u2019s dad take him to one of his relatives?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"They picked up Olivia 2 hours later than they were supposed to and Tim was crying.

Depending on the kid, that could worse than him getting tired in the car.", "NTA for recognizing your limitations and not wanting to spoil the special outing you'd planned for the original kid. \n\nThat said, I encourage you to reconsider the use of the term \"special needs\" both in general and especially with regard to autistic people. \"Special needs\" has become a dysphemism - a phrase coined in an attempt to reduce stigma that has actually fallen out of favour itself (like \"retarded,\" which just means \"slowed down\" vs. \"utterly unable ever\", but the connotation has become negative nonetheless).  Importantly, this is not a term that was chosen by disabled people themselves. Additionally, it doesn't always apply to autistic people. If someone who's autistic requires near-constant care, that's very different from someone who is on the far end of the spectrum and just needs a few additional supports to deal with an allistic-dominated world.", "NTA... but only just.\n\nIt's reasonable to say that you can't look after a neurodiverse kid that you don't know and who doesn't know you.\n\nThis was an unexpected thing and not something that your brother likes to dump on you just because.  So in theory you couldn't rescheduled looking after just Olivia in a fortnight's time (when Tim would be at his dad's) and you could've all stayed home together.  Olivia didn't know about the cafe date.  It would've still be a nice thing to do whether you did it that day or later.\n\nWhat sort of special needs does Tim have?  It's usually a spectrum and some needs are easier to accommodate than others.  Some kids also react to strangers better than other kids so that's always something to bear in mind.\n\nThe other thing was that perhaps the errands they were doing for Kate's mother could've been rescheduled unless they were taking her to an appointment.  Food could be ordered online for her if that was one of the errands.  \n\nAnd why didn't your brother just stay home with Tim and Kate could've sorted her mother out on her own?", "NTA.

I speak from a place of knowledge. \n\nIf they really want to do this right for Tim, they need to have a couple regular babysitters who can come over to his, and maybe after he's comfortable with them, he can go to theirs.

I think the OP senses that, and so he's NTA for not taking Tim as well.", "This but also what \"errands\" take 5-6 hours and require 2 adults.

You're absolutely doing the right thing.", "NTA though I would suggest you ask your brother to let you spend time with your step nephew where he can teach you how he cares for him\u2026.. by you both watching him together. Start with an hour. Then when the kid and you feel comfortable spending all day with him you can try watching him for 15 minutes without your brother. Explain this process will take months and years. He must teach you how to handle melt downs and help prevent meltdowns. Then if you ever reach that point you can try babysitting solo for 2 hours and they better be back on the dot or you will never babysit again. \n\nOr if you are not up for that, explain to your brother honestly why you are not up for it. \n\nMy nephew is Autistic & has ADHD \u2026.. since they didn\u2019t diagnose him with autism until he was 11 I would say it is a milder case.

No. As I said, I understand your discomfort.

Now, I do have a couple of caveats. I'm assuming here that there was a good reason why Either your brother or Kate couldn't stay home to watch him while the other did the errands, and I'm assuming that Kate wasn't downplaying Tim's issues, that she was being truthful that he'd be fine.

It sounds like babysitting Tim is not a cinch and if anything happened it would be horribly stressful for someone inexperienced. They really do need a better backup plan for emergencies, and if you ever wanted to be included in that, you and he would need to know each other much better and you would need training and briefing.", "Did you bother to explain that you planned to take the girl out and staying inside was not on the plans. \nHaving a full pictures helps people.", "NTA.

Her father was fine with her treat day being spoiled so he could have his own. OP can do a lot of good by providing Olivia with special time of her own, one on one.

The 7 year old was crying because of and hour drive and being stuck in traffic.

What if the bathroom color doesn\u2019t work for the kid or the toilet paper is in the wrong place?
