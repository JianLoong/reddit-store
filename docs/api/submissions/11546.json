But she will buy 2 kid tables for our only child when I only agreed to one table", "We have joint and separate finances and we are still fully transparent with each other. We review credit scores, debt, savings etc together.", "They have a child together and live together... \ud83d\ude05", "They\u2019re living together, with their child\u2026", "Except for taking care of their child full time? Which, at least in my area, is worth 10k or more per year...", "If she\u2019s not working then presumably she\u2019s a SAHM caring for their child. That\u2019s not nothing and it\u2019s certainly contributing, even if she doesn\u2019t get paid. What if something happens to OP? She\u2019s going to need that information. Also, giving her access doesn\u2019t mean giving up control. If you\u2019re a team you both need to be informed. \n\nAnd I say this as someone in a similar situation. My husband and I moved 16 years ago when he got a new job. This required me to give up my job, although I planned to do some telecommuting until I could find another. However, that was the year the economy tanked and then I got pregnant. I still do a small bit of telecommuting but am basically a SAHM. \n\nHe\u2019s cautious about money. He pays the bills and still balances the checkbook on paper. But he does not deny me access to money or to information about it. I may only bring in a little income but I do/did all the things a SAHP does. Get the kids to and from school and appointments, handle food shopping, cooking, laundry, etc. \n\nI\u2019m contributing.  \n\nIn a partnership both people need to be equally informed and have access to things. It can be problematic otherwise especially in an emergency.", "She should be able to know where the money is going.", "She lives with him and they have a child together.", "Financial abuse is not a thing. They are not married and while they have a kid he is the only one working. And seems to be making financially sound decisions to decrease debt and save money. If we are to take his side of the story as truth she is the only blowing the money. \n\nNTA.", "She has free reign with my money, what ever she wants she gets regardless if she asks me about it. Half the time I ront even know what's been bought until after when i physically see it.", "She wants acess, joint account or password. And I do have a plan to pay ot back, we just had medical Bill's that got paid that pushed us over, she spends more on things we dont need more than I do", "[removed]", "She does work, full time, inside the home.", "It's not her money... if she wants to look at it then they need to discuss joint finances. It seems like she just wants to be looking at his money that she doesn't contribute to at all. I would say ESH but I really don't see how this is abusive.", "I could be wrong, but it sounds like OP doesn't even show her the accounts. The way OP words it sounds to me like what she wants is him to sit down with her and them go through the finances together.\n\nN T A for not giving her passwords/access but YTA for not even being willing to discuss finances and show your partner what your family finances are like OP.", "NTA because she\u2019s a girlfriend not a wife. 3 years is not that long. Wife is a different story but she\u2019s a girlfriend so I absolutely would not show her my finances.", "I don't agree that genders matter here.  Anyone trusting someone else to support them has a right to see finances.", "I agree with this Nta, just show her your accounts but dont give hwr access, god knows what she will do if you do. She has the right to know but OP also has the right to keep it private", "I don't think there is ever a guaranteed point in a relationship where you have to give someone your bank account information. I find it weird that he won't show all of his exact balances or statements or debts or whatever, but I don't think even Married couples should ever be expected to give full access to each other's bank accounts.", "Jesus, I didn't realise the 1950s had access to reddit", "[removed]", "Implication is she's taking care of the kid so they don't have to pay for childcare. She's a stay at home mom. This is her job.\n\nYTA OP", "Just to add, try to imagine how scary this could be if the situation is reversed. What if you didn't work (presumably because you are a SAHP) and your partner never tells you how much money you have or how much is being spent, then suddenly reveals that the house is thousands in debt? That's scary. \n\n\nThe amount of debt isn't terrible, and it's good you are working on it. Why are you trying to shoulder that stress alone, though? You should rely on your partner and work together.", "Because she's questioning the highly secretive and financially dubious man. How dare she?!", "You need to sit down together and talk about a budget and whether or not there is disposable income. Prioritize work equipment and reduction of credit card debt. I\u2019m not sure how old you both are or if you two want to be in a permanent relationship, but you should be building good financial habits now.", "I think that you need to add those instances to the post because right now, people might see it as you just trying to be shady.", "Well, from your post history it looks like you\u2019re spending quite a bit of money on legos and classic car parts for someone who is in debt \ud83d\ude44", "Are you aware that people can look at your other posts on different subreddits and see you talking about things that you spend money on?", "By legal standards, that doesn\u2019t matter.", "Taking care of their child is work, and work that could easily cost more than the paycheck she\u2019d bring in if she were to work outside the home.", "That makes it even more ridiculous she can\u2019t see the accounts. How is she supposed to make spending decisions?", "Well, is she spending it on essentials or bs? Because that could be the real issue, unlike you not showing her your financials under the false guise that somehow gives up your control. You get to choose which employer you have right? She\u2019s spending the money anyway, let her see how it affects the financials. You sound like you are already halfway out the door by not being transparent", "Do you think it\u2019s possible if she had a clearer picture of your finances she might make different - more careful - spending decisions?", "I\u2019m sorry but this is a pretty dysfunctional way to handle finances. She has no idea what the accounts look like so how does she know how much she can spend? Y\u2019all need a budget and you need to be on the same page about how to handle the money. If she\u2019s a SAHM, you effectively have joint finances and she should be involved. Whichever one of you is better at managing money should take the lead but you should both know what\u2019s going on. You can each have an allowance that the other person doesn\u2019t question how it\u2019s spent, but household finances shouldn\u2019t be a secret. YTA", "But it's important for her to know where you stand...either she would cut back and be more economical because she knows you need to save money, or you'll discover that she doesn't care about family finances and is selfish. Either way, she should very much be a part of the financial discussion.", "Does she know what your household income and expenses are?  It\u2019s not really fair to claim that she\u2019s overspending while also saying that you want to take care of all of the financial stuff yourself.  If you want her to make reasonable financial decisions she needs to know what the household finances are.", "Well, if you won't let her see all the finances, then of course she's going to spend more - she has no idea what your finances are and she knows you've been hiding it from her, so the natural assumption is that you're hiding money and can afford it.", "Then sit down and have a deep conversation about finances. Talk about it. Show her what's going on. Be fully transparent. Ask her what she's going to do to help the family. How would giving her access help the family? Let her explain why she wants it. This is the kind of mature, difficult conversation people have to have with their partners", "Does she do the majority of child care and domestic labor??", "Maybe she would spend less if she felt involved in the financials.", "How can she overspend when you won't let her know how much money there even is?", "If she is spending too much on things you don\u2019t need then transparency is important, how can she know what she\u2019s spending is detrimental if she doesn\u2019t know how much you have to spend?", "Hence the suggestion to talk.", "It\u2019s \u2019their\u2019 money, I don\u2019t get why Americans in particular have this extraordinarily ring fenced approach to all their affairs.", "\u201cIt seems like she wants to be looking at his money that she doesn\u2019t contribute to at all.\u201d \n\nShe provides full time care for his child. She absolutely contributes to his money. Sounds like he doesn\u2019t make much money, and her earning potential is likely the same. The daycare bill might be thousands a month depending on the area.", "Girlfriend and mother of his child who completely relies on OP and his finances. It\u2019s fair to show her the circumstances that she is depending on. NAH because everyone involved seems young and with little financial literacy and few resources.", "Not every couple gets married, commitment is what\u2019s important, not what the government says about your relationship", "If it were just a girlfriend, that would be one thing. But OP also has a child with her\u2014they are responsible for the child, and OP is the sole supporter/income for the family.\n\nEdit to add: this isn\u2019t a dating situation. They are living like a family\u2014together\u2014and caring for the child.", "if you trust someone enough to have a kid with them, you should trust them with finances, if you\u2019re living together.", "According to OP it is NOT about SEEING. It's about full-fledged financial control.", "The issue is lack of trust on both sides.", "Yeah that one has red flags all over the place.", "I think giving her your account passwords is a bit extreme, but I have a spreadsheet where I keep track of all my accounts that my wife has access to so she can see what's going on. Something like that might be a good way to go.", "But it doesn\u2019t make sense for her not to have any income when they\u2019re struggling financially. OP is in debt just to provide basics", "Yes it does, if they live in a common law state.", "I know this. I personally stay home with my 3 LOs for over 7 years. But was married and agreed to that with my husband. We also had an agreement to do things together. I never touched his money when we were dating and living together. And I never made the assumption I could. Assumptions are the mother of all f*ck ups. We are only getting one side. And this side paints her as the one making risky or bad financial decisions by paying for randomly online sites(as mention fans only). He seems to be the more reasonable one. Seems being the key word because we don\u2019t have her side.", "Why would she make spending decisions with his money in the first place?", "Yeah, I don't understand how she can make better choices or understand what their future options are without knowing their financial situation.  Right now it sounds like she can freely spend money, but is left in the dark about their debt situation and how much extra cash (if any) they have. That makes it almost impossible for her to make realistic spending decisions.", "Right because nobody ever faked a spreadsheet.", "OP won\u2019t even tell her their financial situation despite her asking. It\u2019s not her fault since she doesn\u2019t know just how much they are struggling financially and as OP said, he wants to do it all alone despite her trying to be involved.", "Daycare costs more than most low income jobs.   The only way this usually works is if the mom works a side job after the dad gets home", "Daycare is costly. In my town in the Midwest, we\u2019re saving money by me staying home between daycare costs, gas money, and car maintenance. When we priced it out it would have been my entire take home pay each month for full time daycare. In many places there are year+ long waitlists as well.", "They could work opposite shifts, so someone is always home for the child.", "He didn't write she was paying for Only Fans. He wrote that he suspects one reason she is wants to see his purchases is to determine if HE'S paying for Only Fans.", "So if you weren\u2019t married your unpaid work at home would somehow be worth less, and you\u2019d deserve less of a say in your own life and your family\u2019s finances?", "Can you read? Lol. All she wants to do is SEE HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE because whether you like it or not they constitute a family unit. \n\nJesus Christ.", "She provides full time care for their child. The other option would be for him to pay her the full amount they\u2019d have to pay in daycare if she weren\u2019t doing so, but I doubt he could afford it.", "If the relationship is at that stage then it's probably time to call it quits", "Never said she needed a physical job. She can do online jobs just to provide something, even if it\u2019s only a couple hundred a week.", "Ok so let\u2019s back up a bit. I never said stay at homework is worthless and you implying I said that is just an AH thing to do. This being the internet we have to judge things as given and hope we are getting the full truth. Contributing to family life whether financially or being a homemaker is all very important. I am saying he isn\u2019t the AH because it SEEMS they didn\u2019t make this arrangement before hand and she ASSUMES she has a right to it because they are together and have a kid. Did I say it was the nice and decent thing for him to do? No.", "Where would she find these online jobs where she could earn a couple of hundred a week?", "With a baby?  Watching a baby is a full-time job.  You can't just ignore the kid to get computer work done.  Like someone else said, the only option would be if she worked after dad got home to watch the baby."]}
