Confide in her about your fears.\n\nEdit to say and be clear: not sharing your finances with your partner and not being transparent, especially when she has not income of her own, leaves her in a constant state of vulnerability. She can't see how much money you have, where it's going, if you have any savings, etc. Worse yet, if something were to happen to you, she doesn't know if she'd have access or lose everything. She needs that access and transparency to feel safe. Not doing so is considered financial abuse. Don't do that to her.", "First: the fact that you specifically used \u201cadult related sites\u201d and \u201conly fans\u201d as the immediate example likely means that you have been using the money to buy that shit.

It\u2019s not exactly a difficult thing to do. Open a joint account, have your income go there, take out an agreed upon amount per pay period for Lego or whatever and then everything else is covered in the joint account. Being in an adult relationship means being partners in multiple ventures, not just having sex.

You get off your ass and work so that that stress isn\u2019t on just one person. \n\nChild care is a real issue, and yes I know that at times one partner will just be going to actually pay for the high cost of daycare. Get assistance. The government gives stipends for child care. They help those in need so that you can work. Lack of skills, well get some.  You can build skills for free.

She has a right to ask. But you also have a right to refuse. You don\u2019t always get what you want in this life. And she\u2019s for now just going to have to learn to be okay with that.

And the fact she insisted on buying the more expensive shelving shows she doesn\u2019t know their (see that- \u201cTHEIR\u201d) finances", "It looks like frivolous spending per his post history", "I'm gonna bet you \u20ac100 right now OP doesn't know the name of his kid's doctor or when his next appointment is", ">You trusted this woman enough to have a child with her\n\nAnd they got pregnant when they barely knew each other. They have a 1.5 y/o in a 3 year relationship so she got pregnant when they'd been dating for roughly 3 months. They're going to have a rough road considering they barely knew each other before having a kid.", "The lack of an answer is enough answer for me.", "I'm a stay at home mom and I have access to everything. I wonder if he gives her any money at all? I would want to know our finances. I wouldn't want to get married unless we were 100% together on finances. If he passed away she would have no idea about their financial status. I know couples who have seperate, but for me I need to know what we have since I'm the one grocery shoppings, handling stuff like oil changes, house repairs, clothes shopping, taking pets to the vet etc. If we were struggling I would get some type of job to help. Luckily we are very comfortable now since I was able to coupon, shop deals and reign in spending. We have 0 debt besides our house.", "OP will be paying child support if he continues to control his partner with money.", "Even if it was only small 'treats', those add up quickly.", "I missed the bit where she\u2019s a SAHM so I gotta change to YTA. It\u2019s not unusual for unmarried couples to have separate accounts and then a shared account for shared expenses, but if she doesn\u2019t have her own income there\u2019s absolutely no reason to do this.", "I only eat once a day but I have to buy a Lego star destroyer my family is starving please help", "His post history with how much he spends on his Lego collection is just the cherry on top. This man would rather skip meals and deprive his gf and baby of things they need, just to get more mini plastic bricks.\n\nOP you can't eat Legos", "I'm guessing you at least talk about them and have an idea so you can at the very least know what to expect in an emergency situation. This guy is saying he won't even talk to her about it. He just expects her to trust that he isn't spending money on useless things. The whole thing sounds really close to what an addict would tell his SO in order to cover up odd spending. I'm not saying that's what's happening, I'm just saying it sounds very suspicious.", "Not just that, it sounds like she doesn't even have access to money? If she has a debit card for an account, she is almost certainly able to get a balance check on an ATM. Who buys the food and household stuff? There is so much OP has to be leaving out.", "OP is spending his money on LEGO.", "I totally agree with this, but my judgment is ESH except for that poor kid. It sounds like I put more planning on what pair of socks I'm going to wear that day than they did about how they were going to raise this kid together.", "This place makes me so much more confident in my decision to NEVER have kids with a man.", "He should sell them to get out of debt", "That certainly puts things in a different light. He appears to be in an abusive relationship. They need couples counseling. Normally, I'd say to run, but there's a kid involved, which really complicated things.", "Yeah this is a big red flag for me. I'm currently on maternity leave and not married, my partner tells me all the time \"it's our money, anything I earn from work is for us, our family and our house because I just want the best for us\". The way we see it, I'm at home raising our child, taking care of the house and dealing with the bills while he goes to work and earns the money to make it all possible. You have to work as a team!", "And he went along with it, so he trusted her to have his child", "I think you misspelled prick-y?", "Where is that? I did not see that. That changes to YTA. My ex used to do that. Not enough money to eat but he paid 3K for a paint job on his car", "She\u2019s probably not working because they can\u2019t afford daycare. That\u2019s why most new moms stay at home now. Monthly daycare expenses cost more than rent in some places. Daycare has become unaffordable for a lot of people, even middle class people.", "Had a family member with a huge spending problem.  98% of his purchases were under $25 dollars, and they never realized they all added up to thousands a month.", "If he passed away, they don\u2019t have a financial status. They aren\u2019t married.", "Ew let\u2019s not shame her for wanting to stay home to take care of their child. Idk where OP is from, but I have a good paying job and we still think that childcare would be too expensive for us.", "Oh, yes, we discuss finances, and we don't shop big ticket items without being in agreement about them. We just don't share the day to day running of bank accounts, bill paying and such. We don't even have the same bank. We do have hard boundaries as to who pays which bills. Although they are hard boundaries, they are up for renegotioation, in case conditions change. It is a marriage, after all.", "The more I read the more it seems like no one's happy in this relationship.", "Does she know his Lego display shelves were $150 a piece or does she think they were a $30 set from Walmart?\n\nAlso, it's very easy to ignore small items bought occasionally when you don't see the monthly total on the credit card statement. Like when you get lazy about packing lunches for work and then you see the $$$ you spent on takeout for the month.", "Yeah, legally (in the US) she's a single mom who doesn't have a job. He could kick her out and stop paying for her basic necessities at any time. It's an extremely precarious situation for her to be in. I think that's why she's trying to get wife-level financial access, even though it still wouldn't come with legal rights. \n\nI hope she can get help with childcare and start herself out on a career. OP does not seem like husband material, either.", "Absolutely, he should be paying X amount into a joint account every pay cheque, he can keep his personal account but she needs to have immediate access to a certain cushion of money for emergencies etc\n\n\n(where X is an amount they both agree on after reviewing their finances - yes, *their* finances)", "Yeah except being actually married would give her more legal rights and protections", "Facts. And now they have a baby together and aren't married. It's easy to say peace out as a bf/gf but harder to leave when married. Unreliable. Never have a baby if you're just a bf/gf \ud83d\udc4e", "Where I live if you cohabitate and have a kid it\u2019s the same as marriage in the eyes of the law.", "Fucking hell this is cringe. Do people just forget that you can easily look at post history?", "Those Star Wars sets ain't cheap. Granted I'm working on a pricey build myself, but I have my priorities straight for the most part.", "The plural for Lego is Lego.", "This is an important point. After all the bills are paid, groceries and children\u2019s need are accounted for, every dime left over is split equally between my husband and I. \n\nWhere is the wife\u2019s portion of the money?", "My ex's and I would kinda do the opposite,  match amounts in a shared account that was enough to cover our monthly expenses (rounded to the next $100), and another smaller amount for shared things (like vacation or buying the empty lot next to our house when it came up for sale) thus leaving us the remainder of whatever me made as our money to do with as we please. \n\nYours feels simpler.

That is a fucking job!\n\nJESUS FUCKING CHRIST", "Lol I feel like we share an ex.", "According to OP in other posts, he gets accused of cheating or \u201cjacking off behind her back\u201d if he takes too long to orgasm, has to do ALL the cleaning after work (2 hours worth every day - she has OCD) or else he gets yelled at, has to let her go through his phone whenever she wants, is accused of cheating if his commute takes even five minutes longer than google maps says it should, gets in trouble if a project he\u2019s working on (cars) takes longer than her \u201cresearch\u201d suggests, and a shit ton of other stuff.", "Together for three years with a 1.5 year old means she got pregnant around 9 months of dating :l wild.", "Having a baby is the #1 biggest commitment you can make with someone.\n\nI know people who got married and divorced in their early 20s with no kids, and it was simple and they have no idea what their ex spouse is up to these days. It's the kids, homes, joint assets, etc that make divorce hard. Unmarried people can also have legal battles over child custody and joint assets, though. It's just that the person who cut back on work gets screwed if they weren't married. \n\nHave a kid with someone and they're in your life forever, unless they totally abandon their child and never come back. And then you still have their ghost to contend with if your child has emotional issues due to the abandonment.", "The number of women who think that is true in England is really worrying to me", "Yeah exactly. My bf and I started off long distance (moving soon to change that) but a few years ago his car broke down and I had helped him pay for rideshares to work while he paid for the repairs, bc he couldnt afford both. That's just what a partnership is.\n\nHe never asked me for help, infact ge insisted I Didnt pay for his ubers.
