There's no reason to allow their entitled behavior to continue.", "NTA. I am a lawyer. First, you should immediately stop letting them use the car. You could be exposed to significant liability if they continue to use and get into an accident. Second, the sister is definitely taking advantage of you and needs to go.", "NTA you are being taken advantage of. If they don't like the conditions you are setting for staying there well. That sucks? not really your problem this is your house and life and their car miles, electric bill, and housing are not your responsibility.", "NTA. They are taking advantage of your kindness. Be meaner and they will go. lol", ">The sister is saying how we let them stay so long before and what do we not like the girlfriend...\n\nYes. You were trusting and open and accommodating for them, and they took advantage of you. Had they been respectful and responsible you  probably would have let this continue, but they showed you that they don't respect you. They damaged your car. They're taking up your space and using your utilities without any consideration for you. Our boundaries are reasonable, and they know why you're putting them in place. Because they didn't act responsibly in the first place. You are NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Give them a timeframe to move out and stick to it-", "NTA\n\nThis line right says it all \n\n\"The girlfriend has her own fricken house and has said before it's nice not paying the pay as go electric bill\"\n\nOP they are using you! Period! End of Story! \n\nThey are staying at your place so much and solely using your car because then GF does not have to pay. They are moving the expenses of existing and traveling from the GF and Sis to you and your wife. Kick the moocher out!", "NTA, you're being taken advantage of and that's not fair in the slightest.\n\nTalk to your wife, make sure you put up a united front and both agree with whatever you decided to do. If the sister and her partner can't see how what they're doing is unfair then I'd be tempted to send them packing. Good luck.", "NTA. You\u2019re already letting the sister live with you. You should not allow the sister to use your car at all.  You\u2019re right, they can stay at the girlfriend\u2019s house.", "NTA\nI think you need to take her to court about your car, there is zero excuse as to why there's a dent in your car and she has no reason why, accidents do happen I had one the other day.\n    Next I think you need to sit down and have a conversation on boundaries, regardless of how long you've let someone stay before it doesn't mean you have to let them stay at all ever again. Also maybe consider giving SIL a 6-month notice time to get your stuff together and get out", "An hour? I\u2019m sorry, but my husband commutes that much for work EACH WAY, and he does it five days a week. It\u2019s one thing for a weekend, but this is going on far too long. Please set boundaries!", "This 100%", "This. Op needs to add sister to the insurance if he wants to let her keep using it but personally I'd just ban usage and maybe set up a security cam so if she takes it without pemission they can report it to the police.", "NTA- I would point to the dent on the car and say- this is why. It's not just that you have damaged my car, but failed to report it to me. You owe me for this damage. You may not use my car at all. And due to your lack of integrity, you cannot stay here any more, what is your time table for leaving. If you do not give me one with a very short time frame, then I will choose one for you.", "NTA. Sis has overstayed her welcome and needs to pay for the car damage, stop using your vehicle and move out. Bye bye sis.", "NTA. \"No, we don't like to be used as a hotel and as uber. You can spend time in her house.\"", "NTA. Why is she living with you?", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.  sister needs to pay to have your car fixed.  Is she working? She needs to be working on getting her own place and stop living off of yall", "NTA\n\nHow long are you going to allow your SIL to impose on you.  Moving in for a move in locale is one thing, but it needs an end date.  With the current issues, the end date needs to be like now.\n\nAlso, your car should be out of bounds totally, especially after she obviously hit something.  You will want to investigate this, as the owner of the vehicle you are legally liable for the damage your car caused.  A hit and run scenario, which it sounds like, may cause you a lot of issues and money in the near future.", "NTA\n\nShe's plain mooching off you. Time to set a date for her to be out I think.", "NTa. Time for her to move out.", "Even if the sister is added to the insurance, it doesn\u2019t fix the liability for OP because based on the dent, OP has reason to believe the sister and/or girlfriend are potentially dangerous drivers. Under a tort theory, negligent entrustment, OP could be held personally liable for continuing to allow the sister to use the car with the knowledge he has.", "Yes and liability is helped when the insurance will pay out the claim vs when its all on his shoulders.", "NTA. Time for an eviction she can go live with her girlfriend from now on. This is why you don't take in roommates if you want a peaceful life.", "NTA. I'm in a similar situation as your SIL, in that I had to move in with my sister and BIL 6 months ago after a lot of unfortunate life events, and will be here until I can buy a new place in about a year or so. They literally saved my life and I could never repay them, I would NEVER take advantage of their kindness by asking for and taking more - in fact, I try to stay as quiet and out of the way as much as possible. Your SIL is TA and if I were you, I'd put a limit on her time there, as she will continue to take advantage the more comfortable she gets.", "Sister needs to go. Give her a deadline and change the locks.", "NTA just say no and toss them out with the law if necessary. Not sure why you're continuing to put up with it.", "NTA No more car use at all.", "NTA I would honestly get her out she is overstayed her welcome", "Also may want to know more about that dent. If it was a hit and run, somebody may be looking for you.", "Don't let her use the car at all. She'll use it to go drive her girlfriend around. NTA", "It's time for sis to move in with her GF, since they wanna be together all the time."]}
