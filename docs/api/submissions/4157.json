We have simple rules like no people over just because we work overnight and we have jobs that are very sensitive and emotionally taxing, so we need sleep during the day as much as possible. We also nicely let the sister use our car since she cant get one at this time... now to this point...she met a girl who lives like a hour away and they were staying at the girlfriends over the weekend. Because of this we met the girlfriend and we thought she was nice and decided to come in and we will meet her. She came to us a while ago to ask if girlfriend could stay the night two nights and we decided okay since she lives an hour away. However unfortunately an event happen that the  family has pulled together and girlfriend has been here two weeks and they keep using my car when the girlfriend has a newer car, brand new tires etc, there's really no reason to use my car but out of pure don't want to put miles on the gfs car. The sister doesn't pay for maintence on my car or anything. We are pretty fed up and what made this breaking point was I normally don't use the car but as I was going to get into it I noticed a huge dent and when confronted she said she didn't know but my wife and I saw clearly there was paint that wasn't ours on it...\nSo my wife and I have decided no more car when the girlfriend is here, and down to two nights only. \nThe sister is saying how we let them stay so long before and what do we not like the girlfriend...\nThe girlfriend has her own fricken house and has said before it's nice not paying the pay as go electric bill...yet neither of them have even paid extra as the girlfriend has been here...", "created_utc": 1670407928, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zexim5/aita_for_telling_my_wifes_sister_no_more/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's no reason to allow their entitled behavior to continue.", "NTA. I am a lawyer. First, you should immediately stop letting them use the car. You could be exposed to significant liability if they continue to use and get into an accident. Second, the sister is definitely taking advantage of you and needs to go.", "NTA you are being taken advantage of. If they don't like the conditions you are setting for staying there well. That sucks? not really your problem this is your house and life and their car miles, electric bill, and housing are not your responsibility.", "NTA. They are taking advantage of your kindness. Be meaner and they will go. lol", ">The sister is saying how we let them stay so long before and what do we not like the girlfriend...\n\nYes. You were trusting and open and accommodating for them, and they took advantage of you. Had they been respectful and responsible you  probably would have let this continue, but they showed you that they don't respect you. They damaged your car. They're taking up your space and using your utilities without any consideration for you. Our boundaries are reasonable, and they know why you're putting them in place. Because they didn't act responsibly in the first place. You are NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
