I don\u2019t post that frequently and I do not pretend to be an expert. I just mainly post when there is a big update or change in my life. \n\nA friend of mine was having a small dinner party last night and one of the guests, Sam*, brought her 10 year old son, Jake*. Sam and I are only acquaintances. Before we ate, Sam and I were talking to another mutual friend when Sam interrupted and said \u201coh I almost forgot you need to tell Jake about your depression! I think it\u2019s so important to hear big truths at this age.\u201d\n\nI do think kids should be aware of mental health on a general level, but the way she said it really bothered me. It was just so out of the blue and such a weird bossy way to ask me to talk to her kid. Regardless, I told Sam I would be happy to talk with Jake about mental health sometime outside of the party and that it\u2019s a good thing to be aware of at any age. She said \u201cno, tell him about your depression. he needs to hear your honesty and I know you\u2019ve had plenty of struggles.\u201d I did not know what to say so I just told her a dinner party may not be the best time to relive trauma. I feel like this was a shitty thing to say and I must have came off very rude or blunt because she immediately changed her whole demeanor and said \u201coh so you only talk about it when loads of people can see and give you attention. I thought you wanted to actually help people.\u201d\n\nAt this point the mutual friend who was still standing with us started talking about school psychologists and asking Sam if Jake had ever talked to a counselor or anything. I was so goddamn grateful and just tucked my tail between my legs and gtfo of that room. \n\nI told my mom about it and she said it wouldn\u2019t have hurt to talk to the kid about paying attention to your feelings and knowing that it\u2019s ok to get help if you\u2019re struggling, just something general like that. She\u2019s right, I totally could have so that and Sam\u2019s reaction have made me feel like an AH. I do think she was being rude in how she brought it up, but I really try to be an advocate for mental health and I think I failed here in regards to the kid. \n\n*fake names", "created_utc": 1694726189, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16iu7gw/aita_for_refusing_to_talk_to_someones_child_about/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good for you!! I agree with your friend about the kid talking to a school counselor instead who has experience with talking about those things with kids (I work with mostly adults and some teens, not kids). There is a way to go about it and this mom was so silly. What if you HAD talked to the ten year old about depression and trauma. He wouldn\u2019t know how to process that much at his age and might have been really uncomfortable. And what if that discomfort about talking about depression followed him and he someday ends up with a mental health disorder. You could have done harm to the kid by doing what the mom asked you to.
