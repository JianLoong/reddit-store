Regardless, I told Sam I would be happy to talk with Jake about mental health sometime outside of the party and that it\u2019s a good thing to be aware of at any age. She said \u201cno, tell him about your depression. he needs to hear your honesty and I know you\u2019ve had plenty of struggles.\u201d I did not know what to say so I just told her a dinner party may not be the best time to relive trauma. I feel like this was a shitty thing to say and I must have came off very rude or blunt because she immediately changed her whole demeanor and said \u201coh so you only talk about it when loads of people can see and give you attention. I thought you wanted to actually help people.\u201d\n\nAt this point the mutual friend who was still standing with us started talking about school psychologists and asking Sam if Jake had ever talked to a counselor or anything. I was so goddamn grateful and just tucked my tail between my legs and gtfo of that room. \n\nI told my mom about it and she said it wouldn\u2019t have hurt to talk to the kid about paying attention to your feelings and knowing that it\u2019s ok to get help if you\u2019re struggling, just something general like that.
