Stole your property, and returned it to the store to buy what she wanted?  \n\n\nShe's lucky you haven't charged her with theft.  You and your wife need couple's counseling.", "NTA. Move out, screw the inheritance, make your own way in the world. A world filled with huge plush unicorns and rainbows, and no awful witches in it.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nAnd you are right to go back to the store and buy the unicorn for your daughter.\n\nBut that is just the tip of the iceberg here.  Your MIL practically forcing you all to move in, and then demanding gratitude and deference for \"allowing\" you to live there, is incredibly controlling.\n\nAnd of course, the silent treatment is just another method of control.  Your wife can apologize for marrying someone who owns their own backbone.  Nothing more.\n\nEDIT:  He can apologize for calling her a \"witch\" because she probably does not practice witchcraft.  But she IS controlling.", "NTA. You where completely right. F\\*cking with your birthday gift to your daugher is a very low blow. She could have just gotten the books as her own gift. Your wife needs to grow a spine and stop letting her mother own her life. \n\nLetting some one buy their way in to your life like that is pretty sick", "NTA\n\nThere is no doubt MIL is being controlling.  Moving in to get the inheritance is CLEARLY controlling because they are saying you can get it if you live here... oh btw we live here also.  Are they near their deathbeds?  Are their other siblings?  If the House and the loss of your identity as a person/individual important?  If your wife doesn't get the house, do you have a place to live?  If they are using the house as leverage, then you KNOW any time they want they can up the emotional price tag because that is a bill that is never paid.\n\nGood luck", "NTA\n\nIf you bought your daughter a present, your MIL had no right to return it. (In fact the police might have something to say about that since it is literal theft. That gift was your give to your minor daughter. But then there's this inheritance thing).\n\nYour MIL *is* controlling and *is* trying to dictate how you raise your child. And there could be no purpose other than control in that condition she put in the will.", "Nope NTA!\n\nYour MIL overstepped there. She had NO business taking a gift that YOU gave your own child and exchanging it! If she wanted your child to have books, she should have purchased the books, but to take away something you gave your child? Nope nope and NOPE.\n\nYou living with your MIL has nothing to do with her overstepping the boundaries. However, if your MIL feels she has the authority to do so, BECAUSE you are living there, then its time to sit down and have a candid discussion (as a family). \n\nIf the inheritance is THAT important to your wife, then you need to figure something out going forward, because unless your inlaws are at deaths door, its going to be a LONG line of years that your MIL is getting in your family business. \n\nAnd No, you have no need to apologize, but your MIL does.", "NTA. She could have got the books, and read them while cuddling her plushie. MIL is being controlling, dangling inheritance over people's heads is just so insanely toxic. Id call the bluff, move out, and go no contact. MIL won't stand not being in her granddaughter's life and will likely soften up. Sure it's toxic too, but there's a reason we have the saying fight fire with fire.", "NTA\u2014I have trouble believing the inheritance is worth this. \n\nYour MIL was manipulative and cruel in returning a gift YOU BOUGHT so she could pick out a gift she liked better. In fact, the more I think about her actions, the more insane it sounds! Why couldn\u2019t she just buy the gifts on her own? Why did she have to mess with your gift? It\u2019s manipulative and cruel all the way down! \n\nShe is absolutely controlling, and this situation can\u2019t stand. Your wife may not like conflict (I imagine she might have been brow beaten her whole life and thus doesn\u2019t have a toolkit to deal with her mom, but she needs one) but conflicts like this will keep occurring over and over until y\u2019all put a stop to it. \n\nYou and your wife need to get on the same page about dealing with MIL. If your wife can\u2019t commit to standing up to her mom when lines are crossed, or if she can\u2019t deliver when the time comes, you need to seek out couple\u2019s therapy because this will destroy your marriage from within. \n\nAnd I wasn\u2019t being jokey earlier: the inheritance isn\u2019t worth it. Get your wife to see that. Move out. If she really values the house over her marriage to you, that is very telling. \n\nStay strong.", "NTA.

You don't have to listen to her and she cannot punish you.\"", "YTA don\u2019t insult witches", "Nta, its sad your wife values her money more than your marriage and child. \n\nAre you gonna grow to resent her for it?
