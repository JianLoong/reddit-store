For the last 6 years he drinks a min of 1-2 beers every single day. Sometimes for money or other reasons he voluntarily wont drink for 1-3 days in row, but that only happens every few months. The 1st year we were married he drank almost a fifth a day until I gave him an ultimatum. He stopped for a brief period but quickly switched to beer. I\u2019ve asked him several times over the years to cut back on his drinking & it has never lasted for more than 2 weeks. \nA couple of weeks ago I asked him to completely stop drinking. He agreed. A few days into it he had a panic attack & lots of anxiety and drank a beer to calm down. I caught him & asked him to use his coping skills or take his medication rather than drink & reiterated that he needed to stop drinking completely. A couple of days after that he got a job offer & had a celebratory beer & drank the following day as well. Again I caught him. He tried to deny he was hiding it. He said he misunderstood our previous conversation & that he thought I asked him to cut back not stop completely. Both times I found hidden beer cans. I told him he was an alcoholic & gave him an ultimatum & said that the next time I caught him he could either go back to his home state alone or get immediate help for his addiction. He agreed. \nToday I found another hidden beer can. He swears it was from before our previous conversation. I don\u2019t know if I believe him. He used to do hide bottles when he was drinking heavily the 1st year of our marriage. I reminded him of this & asked him to explain why he was hiding it. He said it was because he didn\u2019t believe he had a problem. That he knew I would get mad if I saw him drink so he hid it. That I made him out to be this monster & he knew he didn\u2019t have a problem so when he felt like having a beer, he had one. I asked him to explain what he meant by \u201cmaking him out to be a monster\u201d because I didn\u2019t believe I had done that. He said it was the way I described his drinking. I asked him to clarify what exactly I said to make him feel this way. He said it was because I said he drank every day, started drinking too early, & drank into the night. He said I might think this but that it wasn\u2019t actually happening that often. \nWhen he\u2019s not working he starts drinking as soon as he\u2019s done with his \u201cchores\u201d; this is typically at 11am/12pm. He will drink throughout the day, at least 1 beer every two hours until about 9pm/10pm. When he\u2019s working he\u2019ll start drinking as soon as he gets home & will have at least 2-4 beers. When we\u2019re really broke he\u2019ll buy a couple of tall cans for the day. He says this is not accurate. That he\u2019s the one who consumes it & buys it & he knows he\u2019s not drinking that much.\nHe holds firm that he has not drunk since our conversation last week & is not an alcoholic & that I can\u2019t make him out to be \u201ca monster\u201d.

It sounds like he has a problem.  The lashing out, the hiding empties, counting days, and the inability to manage emotions without a drink all point to someone with addiction issues.  He's not a monster, but he does need help confronting this before things get worse.", "I was married to an alcoholic for longer than I should have been. Your husband is not married to you. He is married to booze. You are not in a relationship with the person beloved by his friends and family members. Being married to an alcoholic is like being married to Jekyll and Hyde. Unless he decides to get sober voluntarily, you are stuck with this guy forever. I feel terribly for you.", "NTA and I swear to God this could have been written by my mother 20 years ago.  The entire story is almost identical to what my father did.  \n\nPro tip:  check his personal closets.  Look in the shoe boxes for bottles of alcohol.  Check the trunk of his car where the spare tire or tool kit would be.  If you have a garage or shed, check there as well.  Check the trash the morning of trash day and look at the very bottom for cans or bottles.  That will tell you exactly what you are dealing with.  I also highly suggest in checking out Al-Anon for yourself.  They helped me a lot.", "I stopped reading somewhere in the middle. Yeah, he is an alcoholic and calling him that is the only favor you can do him. He has still a long way to go.\n\nYou gave him an ultimatum and he didn't comply.

He is an alcoholic. And I've never met one I want to spend 10 minutes with. He won't change until he admits he has a problem and he wants to change it. Otherwise, this is the rest of your entire life. Is that what you want?", "NTA.  Your husband is self medicating with alcohol.  He certainly sounds dependent on it even if he is not falling down drunk.  His medication might not be working if he is drinking.  For example, if he was on an antidepressant and drinking alcohol (which is a depressant), his medication won't work as well.  He definitely needs help with his anxiety other than the beers to relax him.  His doctor would be the best person to help him figure it out.", "You are NTA but he is not going to change. So you need to decide if this is how you want to live or not.", "NTA. I can tell your from experience that giving your husband ultimatums is not going to make him stop drinking. I tried it with mine and it never worked. You husband is an alcoholic and he won't stop drinking until he decides he want to and he won't get help until he decides he wants help.\n\nHaving no money for bills or food never mattered to my husband. As long as he had his beer everything was fine. That sounds the same for your husband.\n\nI suggest looking into Al Anon. You don't need to go to meetings if it makes you uncomfortable but their website is helpful. You can also get some books to read about it. You need to detach from him and live your own life and let him live his. It is hard but it is the only way to keep yourself half sane while going through this.\n\nI wish you the best!!", "NTA\n\nSounds like he has a problem. The challenge is that until *he* accepts he has a problem, nothing is going to change.", "NTA. Your husband has a serious health issue, and you were right to bring it to his attention. He agreed to get help and never did. How long are you supposed to deal with this? Again, NTA.", "NTA. Pack his bags and tell him to either move to his home state or accept your help, as you said you would.", "NTA. From your description, it sounds like he does have an alcohol addiction, and is in denial. Your later comment about finding hidden beer confirms it. \nMy husband is also an alcoholic and in denial. I feel for you.", "So your husband is an alcoholic,  plain and simple. Now it's on you to decide if you want to waste more years of your life on someone who will choose a bottle over you every time. Simple as that.", "NTA. OP, speaking from experience here, I strongly encourage you to participate in Al-Anon. It is a recovery group for friends and family members of alcoholics/other addictions. \n\nI can almost promise you that you will drive yourself crazy in dealing with his drinking. I learned so much in Al-Anon. The acceptance, the love, compassion and support were beyond compare. To finally make peace with the fact that there was not a dang thing I could do about his drinking was extremely difficult. To learn that I was not alone and that, in actuality, I was the one driving myself crazy from trying to reason with an alcoholic was powerful. Sadly, I didn't find Al-Anon until the last year of my husband's life when he died of alcoholic cirrhosis. I didn't understand that his drinking was actually killing him. Al-Anon not only helped me make my peace with him, it helped me make peace with myself.", "NTA. anyone who cant go without a drink every day is a flat out alcoholic", "NTA.  He is an alcoholic.

There is lots of help out there for you.", "NTA but you are never going to win this fight. He isn\u2019t going to admit he has a problem unless he wants to, and that day may never come. My mom is an alcoholic and has been one for my whole life. She has cirrhosis and alcohol induced dementia in her early 60s. She spent 8 weeks in the hospital and memory care earlier this year and it was a giant mess. Think about whether or not you want that for your future. Think about whether you want to have children with a person like that. Alcoholism is an ugly, brutal disease, and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone.", "1~2 beers dont seem alot. In europe its not uncommon to have a glass or two of wine during dinner. And wine has double the alcohol content than beer.", "Very gentle YTA. I'm an alcoholic and had similar behavior of hiding it. After a particularly bad night, my partner spoke to me calmly and without judgment when I was sober. He told me that he wants us to have a long healthy life together and he'll support me to stop drinking and not judge me if I slip. He recognized that I wanted to stop and I recognized that I hid it out of shame and then drank in excess out of some form of rebellion. That conversation changed me and made me fall even deeper in love with him. I've slipped a few times and he didn't call attention to it but when I don't drink, especially when I'm stressed he congratulates me. If he had given me an ultimatum the toxic part of my mind would've made me drink more. \nPerhaps you can take a more compassionate approach with your husband. If he doesn't want to quit obviously that won't work but maybe it's worth a try.", "Being a drunk and being an alcoholic are similar yet different. If he or she is drinking to the point of stupor everyday then that's an issue. 1 or 2 drinks per day i guess defines someone as an alcoholic but as long as they are fulfilling their obligations and responsibilities then i don't see a problem. But i'll go nta if he's spending money on it he doesn't have", "He sounds like a pretty low grade alcoholic to me. One can every hour or two. Two beers a night? He probably needs some sort of help. Alcoholism is usually a symptom of other problems. Stress, anxiety, depression, other emotional issues that require therapy to address. Treating him badly will likely exacerbate the issues and cause more drinking. Honestly, one beer an hour isn\u2019t even getting drunk. Two beers a night isn\u2019t drunk. There are people in marriages who would be thrilled to trade this for their spouse\u2019s problem. Are there real behaviors that his drinking is causing that harm the household? Violence would be the first to come to mind. ? Duties neglected? I\u2019d stay away from making you or him out to be an AH, but he likely needs therapy, maybe medication, maybe couples therapy.", "YTA for one simple reason: you expect an alcoholic to go cold turkey like it's nothing. He's not going to quit while you keep treating him that way. If he's going to get help you need to be supportive instead of belittling him.", "yta, grow up.", "1-2 beers a day isn't shit.

If this isn't what you want, nobody will blame you for leaving the marriage. You've had many conversations over the years and he's always side-stepped and made excuses. Now, he's shifting the blame and making you feel guilty for him being how bad he is. \n\nIt is NOT your fault. Addiction is a horrible disease and and the addict must want to get well. It's not on you to offer more than support. If you're at the end of your rope, it's better to end this.", "NTA except to yourself.", "NTA, from what you describe he obviously is an alcoholic. But you need to realise that you telling him that and giving him this challenge/ultimatum is going to do absolutely nothing to change the situation while he believes that he does not have a problem. As you have seen, he pretended to cut down his drinking by hiding it from you as a way to humour you and make you think he was taking you seriously. \n\nThe best thing to do, for you and for him, is to stick to your words and follow through with any boundaries you have set. Not an easy thing, by any measure, and it is so unfortunate that the people that care for addicts need to be in the position of making these choices. It's often said that until people hit \"rock bottom\" they won't be able or willing to admit that they have a problem and need help with it. If they never face consequences for the way they behave due to their addiction - whether that's the loss of relationships or health scares or anything else - they will never perceive their illness as a negative thing in their life that needs addressing. The important thing you need to remember, though, is that your ultimatum may not be enough for your husband to have that rock bottom epiphany. For some people, the disease of addiction has *so deep a hold* on them that even their own impending mortality or something like having their child removed from their care is enough to convince them that they should want to fight back against it. (Both examples from my own family.)  So if you take the action of issuing an ultimatum and intending to follow through, make sure to realise that it is only *your own* well being you can be assured of improving. You can hope for improvement for your husband too, but it's not guaranteed; and if he doesn't change *that is not your fault*. \n\nI wish you the best moving forward. Loving someone who is an alcoholic/addict is incredibly difficult, when you want so much to help them but they deny that there is even a problem.", "I don\u2019t understand.  You husband is obviously an alcoholic.  He knows it.  You know it.  You also know he isn\u2019t going to stop.  You know he\u2019s going to keep lying about it.    So what\u2019s the point here?\n\nYou also aren\u2019t an ah for saying he\u2019s an alcoholic.  It\u2019s obvious to everyone.", "NTA. He is an alcoholic and is not trying to help himself. Hiding bottles and cans is a huge red flag. Is this how you want to spend the rest of your life? It will only get worse.", "I mean, I don't see how OP is \"stuck with this guy forever\" - divorce is a thing. Did I miss a mention of kids or something?", "I\u2019ve found them in the car but hadn\u2019t thought about checking the trash. Ty", "I 100% agree on your point that he is self medicating because his depression meds might not be the right choice or the right strength, but there is common misunderstanding between mental depression and depressant drugs. \n\nDepression in terms of the mental disorder, describes low energy, loss of interests and lowered mood, to state it simply. A depressant drug is one that suppresses, or depresses, the central nervous system, typically through activation of of GABA receptors. GABA receptors are vital in cellular communications in that they facilitate the influx of negative ions into cells, thus reducing the activity of those cells. With issues like anxiety, this helps by reducing the overall excitability of the central nervous system, leading to less symptoms that accompany anxiety. I'm sure everyone is familiar with Xanax. Xanax is a depressant drug that is often paired with anti-depressants, due to the fact that depression and anxiety are usually present together and fuel each other (some people can get their depression under control by treating the underlying anxiety and vice versa). Alcohol works in a very similar way to benzodiazepines, like Xanax, so many people with uncontrolled anxiety will turn to alcohol due to its wide availability.\n\n\nAs someone who deals with these drugs and people with these conditions, I feel that it is important to point out the difference between the terms depressant and depression, because it is a very common and confusing misconception. It can be very frustrating to someone dealing with depression, who is also taking depressant drugs, for someone to point out that they are \"literally taking depressants\"", "Most people who say they are \u201ccutting down\u201d or that they can quit any time are alchies, too.", "Nope. Nope nope nope she is not responsible for his recovery.", "You're right that a couple drinks a day isn't shit, but that's only true if it's a choice. When you NEED a couple drinks a day, that's an addiction.", "It\u2019s a minimum of 1-2 beers, it quickly turns to a six pack during work days and a twelve pack on the weekends. Sorry I ran out of characters to elaborate more in the post.", "1-2 beers daily is alcoholism.", "He's hurting himself. A six pack a day, *every day*, and a twelve pack on weekends means that his liver will be damaged, especially if he's also on prescription medication that's taxing his system's ability to metabolize substances. Some prescriptions are metabolized only AFTER the body has finished metabolizing alcohol, which means that if you drink and then take those medications, the medication will hit you all at once and drastically alter both the immediate effects and the long-term impact on the body.\n\nIt's an asshole move to intentionally destroy your own organs because health care is a limited resource. In the US, because of the way the medical education system works, there's a hard limit on the number of new doctors every year-- so their time is limited and we can't just add more doctors to compensate for assholes INTENTIONALLY giving themselves medical problems. Other countries may have different systems, but very few places have a surplus of medical doctors. \n\nNote that when I say \"intentionally,\" I mean that alcoholism is a disease, but refusing to *treat* the disease is why it's intentional. Refusing to engage in preventative care until you need critical care is an intentional choice. Alcoholics who recognize the problem and get treatment BEFORE it gets worse are doing the right thing, of course.\n\nAlso, OP is this guy's *wife.* She's yoked to him for the rest of her life unless she very expensively and traumatically unyokes herself. If he chooses to destroy his own body and mind, it will affect her. He may decline to the point that he becomes violent, and she'll be the closest target. He may become seriously ill, and she'll end up sharing his medical debt and having to take care of him. If he destroys his own ability to function, he won't be able to be an equal partner to her, and will end up becoming dead weight who can't live up to his vows to her-- a parasite. Parasites harm their hosts.\n\nSo alcoholism DOES hurt people.", "Yeah because lying doesn't hurt anyone... Smh", "I hope that she will project herself into a future with this person and come to that conclusion on her own. I'm trying to be a bit more nuanced, but yes. Divorce. That's what worked for me.", "My uncle hid bottles in the toilet water tank, shoe boxes, decorative bottles on windowsills, etc. Anywhere he could think of.

Especially if it's effecting work and other responsibilities", "Nah, I honestly disagree. If you\u2019re really only drinking one beer a day when you get home from work or a glass of wine with dinner, that isn\u2019t alcoholism. Stopping at one (or even two on a special occasion) means you\u2019re in control. Plus, most folks who just like 1-2 drinks a day generally aren\u2019t destroying their relationships and their bodies. \n\nThat said, I doubt OP would be writing this post if her husband was just having a glass of wine with his dinner. It sounds more like he starts drinking the minute he completes his tasks for the day and then doesn\u2019t stop. He also likely behaves in a way that hurts his relationship with his wife when he\u2019s drinking. Furthermore, even when given an ultimatum by his wife, he continues to do it while hiding the evidence and then makes her the bad guy when he gets caught. He definitely is an addict, but I think it\u2019s a bit hyperbolic to claim that having a beer a day makes you an alcoholic.", "Lol ok nerd", "I mean, there is nothing she can actually do so she's got two options.

He just doesn\u2019t see the irony in him beginning to drink immediately after those things are done and how heavy it becomes when he\u2019s not working. Like weekends and periods of unemployment.", "Nothing is cool about having to drink 2+ beers a day.", "Experienced.\n\nAlcoholism isn't bound to a certain amount actually. Or being drunk. That's a total misconception. The \"daily\" part is the tricky part."]}
