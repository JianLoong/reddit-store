The b\u00e9chamel can be make with plain milk, but steeping it really kicks it up a notch.\n\nSteep a litre of milk overnight in chopped/grated onion, celery and carrot. Make a roux from 100g butter, enough flour to soak up the butter, then stir in the litre of steeped milk (after filtering out the veggies). Salt and pepper to taste, a small amount of crushed garlic optional. If I'm in a hurry and didn't prepare the night before, I steep and heat in the microwave for 5 min to accelerate the taste transfer. Steeping the milk really gives the b\u00e9chamel a richness and depth. \n\nThe rag\u00f9 is a large onion chopped fine, fried in olive oil until softened (or use a soffrito), add a heaped tsp of chopped garlic, saut\u00e9 for a minute, add minced beef (1kg 10-15% fat), salt and pepper to taste, brown off the mince, then add a dash of red wine and let it cook off for a minute. Add 400g finely chopped tomatoes (tinned if lazy!) and 400g passata, and a tablespoon or two of tomato pure\u00e9 if you have. We're South Africans so here we add 2-3 tablespoons of Mrs Balls Original Chutney (we add Mrs Balls to most things \ud83d\ude09). Add herbs to taste, eg oregano (I often just put an Italian herb blend in), then simmer gently stirring occasionally until the tomato sauce turns brown, about 10-15 minutes.\n\nAssemble the lasagna in a deep dish, meat sauce (thin layer - make sure the mince isn't clumpy), b\u00e9chamel, lasagna sheets, b\u00e9chamel, meat sauce etc, ending with lasagna then b\u00e9chamel. Top with grated mild cheese eg mozzarella or mozzarella/mild cheddar blend and ground black pepper, and oven cook at 180\u00b0C for 40m. Personally I don't like cheese in every layer as it becomes quite rich so I put plenty of b\u00e9chamel and leave the cheese for the top, but if you have finely grated grana padano parmesan you can dust a light layer on top of each layer of lasagna sheets. \n\nIt's fairly close to a traditional Italian recipe and I've only had good reviews \ud83d\ude09", "I love good stuffed cabbage.
