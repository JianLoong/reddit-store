I\u2019ve started baking since high school and have been making birthday cakes for my family. It was a good way to let people know I bake, to get feedback and to experiment. Thanks to that, I\u2019ve gotten a few cake orders from my relatives and friends. After high school, I\u2019ve gone to culinary school and have been working professionally since. \n\nI\u2019ve made birthday cakes for my sister, her husband, her 3 kids, my parents every year (excluding a couple years in between when I was abroad.) I didn\u2019t charge them anything as it was a present from me. These custom cakes normally cost around $200-250. This year on my birthday I didn\u2019t have anything planned, didn\u2019t remind anyone that it was coming up. I was hoping at least one of them would remember and surprise me with something, but when I asked my mom if she bought a cake for me, she thought I would bake a cake for myself, on my birthday. I was hurt. I didn\u2019t make cakes wanting to get anything in return, but I realised I was being taken for granted. \n\nAfter a few months it was my nephew\u2019s 7th birthday. This time I decided to not bring a cake and instead bought him a toy he wanted. When I got to my sister\u2019s house, she asked me where the cake was. I told her I didn\u2019t bring one. She got mad at me, saying that she expected me to bring a cake and didn\u2019t order one from a shop. I told her that it wasn\u2019t my problem, she could\u2019ve asked me and ordered one from my bakery. \nMy nephew was crying that he didn\u2019t have a cake and my sister blamed me for making him sad on his birthday. \n\nAfter the birthday party, I had numerous relatives making me seem like the bad guy and ruining the party. When I talked to my friends and coworkers about this, they were on my side.

If no one had even asked you to bring a cake i don't see how this is your fault. Sounds like a few people in your family are being entitled brats (not the nephew).   \n\n\nAlso that sucks that you were expected to produce your own birthday cake. Rough.", "NTA\n\nThey Assumed you would make a cake and didnt bother to confirm you were actually making one. I would stop all together baking for family unless asked and Paid. No more freebees. Tell your family that you are no longer baking for free.", "Do people communicate in your family? How does the topic of a birthday cake for a child not come up from your sister? Oh yeah, I know, entitlement. You were being taken for granted. Don't feel bad for other people's delusions. Your family doesn't reciprocate what you do for them.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit: I'm seeing people say OP is the AH because of the 'expectation' she set by making cakes for family members in the past, and also that she 'punished' her nephew by not making the cake. I disagree with this point because OP indicated that she takes orders for custom cakes for family, and in this case her sister did not request a cake (or even discuss it with OP). And OP did not punish her nephew, especially since she got her nephew a present he wanted, which is more than she got for her own birthday. OPs sister deserves all the blame for poor planning, 100%. If it were my kid and my sister usually brought the same thing year after year, I'd still ask if they were going to because that's the reasonable thing to do when planning an event. I'd feel differently if OP hinted at making a cake, but that isn't what it says in the post. Her family feels entitled to OPs hard work by suggesting either of these things. It confirmed all her suspicions.", "NTA. It\u2019s very weird to me that she just assumed you would bring the cake. Even if you are normally the family cake baker, I\u2019m assuming there is usually at least some conversation in advance to talk about what the person wants. Birthday cakes are really important to kids that age so his parents should have been on top of it.", "Nta. They're taking you for granted. They could have at least asked you about the cake beforehand. You don't owe em anything.", "NTA, they didn't even talk to you about what kind of cake he might like. Just tell them you brought the same kind of cake they all brought for your birthday... air cake. For real, though. You're a busy person. People suck, and they shouldn't assume.\n\nI once offered a month in advance to order a cake for my niece's birthday, since they were coming from out of town. My brother and SIL didn't answer, so I figured they made another plan. Then they told our sister 3 days before the party that I was bringing the cake. If my sister hadn't told me, I never would have known, and then who would look like the big jerk? Did I mention that people suck?", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure if ESP is a hereditary thing, but how on earth could your sister be upset with you not doing something that wasn\u2019t asked of you?\n\nBeing taken for granted is one thing, but to just expect it to happen without even asking is another.", "NTA.\n\nShe had no right to just assume you would be making one. Even if you normally do. It's not your responsibility to make sure he had a cake.\n\nThat was also not very nice for your parents to think you would make your own cake. Thats just lazy on their part. Why should you do all the work on your birthday? I would be upset, too. \n\nOne year on my birthday, my dad told me he had a BDay card for me and to drive over and just let myself in their house and grab it when they weren't home...like seriously? \n\nEveryone wants to feel special on their birthday! They should have put in effort!", "NTA - You don't have to gift a cake if you don't want to. Their assumption that you would, without any evidence or confirmation, certainly affirms that they are taking the cakes for granted. They made their son sad by not making sure there would be a cake. Any of the people complaining could have asked you or provided a cake themselves. You gave a gift. That it wasn't the gift they wanted you to give is not your problem. You gave the gift you wanted to give, a toy you knew he wanted.", "NTA it\u2019s not your duty to provide the cake, especially without being asked to do so. making cakes is hard work, so expecting one for free also isn\u2019t fair. how would they feel if they were expected to work for free all the time?", "NTA\u2026kind of. Sure seems like your family was taking you for granted, even if they didn\u2019t realize that\u2019s what they were doing. That is terrible and I\u2019m really sorry. \n\nHOWEVER, kinda sucks your nephew ended up in the middle of it. This could\u2019ve easily been avoided by communicating with your sister in advance that your approach to birthdays would be changing or by choosing an adult\u2019s birthday to make your statement. \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely your sister\u2019s responsibility to ensure and not just expect a cake will appear at her son\u2019s party, but regardless, I can understand her line of thinking, even if it\u2019s inconsiderate. But bottom line, your nephew got the short end of the stick on this one.", "Nta. However, I think this was a good lesson to learn. Keep giving free stuff, and it'll just be expected. Your family was absolutely taking advantage of you. So, going forward, I would send everyone a message that if they want a cake from you, they can pay you the normal rate, and if they don't like it, then that's their problem. Your time should never have been free, but, being a professional in the industry myself, I 100% understand your sentiment. I've had family friends ask me to help them cater parties and as soon as I tell them \"sure, my rate is $20/hr plus the cost of food and any extra hands I need\" they immediately drop it.", "NTA. You're not responsible for every cake for every function. Its great that you've been willing to do it but it shouldn't be expected. It also seems like your family doesn't contribute for ingredients which can be expensive. I'd set a boundary \"I'm willing to make it if you cover ingredients but after nobody wanted to get me a cake for my birthday, I refuse to give you my work for free.\"", "NTA, very entitled and stupid of them to just assume, they're definitely taking you for granted.", "NTA You're being taken advantage of by your own family. From now on tell them if they expect a cake they need to order in advance and pay for it.", "NTA. I cannot get behind the E S H votes.  Your sister NEVER ASKED FOR A  CAKE. As the parent, it is her responsibility to ensure cake happens. She didn't. She assumed you'd bring a cake, but instead, your brought your nephew a toy. It's really easy to just run out and buy a cake from a store. You didn't punish your nephew in any way, and he probably got a cool toy out of it.", "NTA\n\nThe very idea is ludicrous.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI think it was kinda spiteful to do this on your nephew's birthday. He was innocent in all this. They should have confirmed you were bringing a cake. It's weird they didn't have any requests on what kind they wanted. It's on the parents to make sure there is cake if their kid wants cake.", "NTA in anyway. They didn't seem to care about your own birthday in any way. I know birthdays are a bigger deal for kids, but your sister didn't even have the decency to ask.", "NTA - even if she assumed, she should have told you what she wanted. Most people have a theme for their kid's birthday nowadays.", "INFO - Since it seems to be your thing to bring a cake to all family birthdays did you mention to anyone after your birthday that you were no longer to be counted on for cakes?  Was there any other function between your birthday/nephew's birthday which you brought one too?\n\nHowever even if you had not I find it a bit entitled to just expect a cake.  If I have a family member who normally contributes X, Y or Z to a party/family function I always check beforehand it is still okay to do so.  Expecting someone to turn up with a $200-$250 contribution without even clarifying it beforehand is insane.\n\nDid your sister not even discuss this with you beforehand?  No discussion of what she was planning on/theme for the cake/numbers she was catering for?\n\nWhat would have happened if you turned up with a cake that was too small for the number of people she invited?", "soft ESH. You let your nephew get caught in the middle of shitty adult behavior. Perhaps you could have made the kid's cake and then showed up empty-handed at the next adult family members birthday gathering?", "NTA Honestly I find their behavior ungrateful, and selfish. Some people just here to take and take without ever thinking of others. The emotional labor, financial hardship you\u2019ve been putting into all of their birthdays and they couldn\u2019t come together for yours is mind boggling. \n\nMy advice set boundaries now, if they want cakes, they can either order it through your services or find another baker. I feel bad for your nephews though. I understand your stance, the anger and disappointment in your family, as a child he wasn\u2019t to blame for any of it. Maybe you can make him a mini cake just for him.", "Don't make any more cakes for ingrates.", "I think they were taking you for granted but I do think making a small child\u2019s (I\u2019m assuming you care about) birthday the hill you die on is weird. You punish a child for your hurt feelings and what the adults did. Seems like a AH move to me", "You\u2019re NTA but a general, \u201clet me know if you want a cake\u201d email or group message might not have gone astray. I do think your family were taking advantage of you, 100%, but I still feel sorry for your nephew - he wasn\u2019t to know that you\u2019d set boundaries. I mean, it\u2019s good you\u2019ve set them now, don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s well justified, he just happened to be the first person to have to deal with the consequences. Either way, I hope things improve going forward.", "[deleted]", "ESH.\n\nYour fam sucks for (basically) ignoring your bday.\n\nYou suck for choosing the 7 yo's bday to take a stand.\n\nYou've been making cakes (from the sound of it without being asked) for several times a year for years without saying anything so you contributed to that expectation.\n\nYou're mad at your fam but ruined the 7 yo's bday when the kids are the least culpable in your family not doing anything for your bday.\n\nA wiser choice would have been giving them a heads up in advance that you were no longer providing free cakes or sucked it up for the kid's bday and told them afterwards that was the last freebie.\n\nBdays mean a lot more when you're a kid", "ESH. You definitely are being taken advantage of. You go the extra mile for your family\u2019s birthdays and they don\u2019t even do the bare minimum for yours. \n\nThat being said, you set a precedent that you would bring a cake for these birthday parties. You knew that your sister was expecting you to bring one. You intentionally punished a 7 year old because of what his mom did. \n\nThere were much better ways to handle this that didn\u2019t involve intentionally hurting your nephew who you supposedly love.", "NTA sort of\n\nHOWEVER, you did set a precedence with your family by making cakes over the years. I understand why she\u2019d assume you\u2019d continue to do this. \n\nI\u2019d say maybe you could\u2019ve said something or she could\u2019ve asked.

There is nothing wrong with your decision to stop being responsible for the centerpiece of other people's birthday.  Your passive-aggressive move here, where you disappointed a child, was not the way to make your feelings known.   At the very least, you could have sent your a message to say that the family baking shop had closed and she needed to make plans for her son's birthday.  As it stands, the majority of your family doesn't understand why *they* were wrong and are blaming you for their own thoughtlessness.  \n\nI suggest writing your sister a note stating that you are sorry that the end date for being taking for granted fell on her son's birthday.  You need to tell your sister, your mom, and anyone who asks that your recent birthday, when on your birthday, you realized that it was time to stop baking cakes for others.", "ESH. Them for taking advantage of you and assuming that you will always provide cake free of charge. You because you didn\u2019t communicate your feelings to them, you just took action. Those actions left a disappointed child crying at his birthday party, you only person who is not an AH.", "ESH. I totally agree that your family has been taking you for granted. Your family are also not entitled to free professional-caliber cakes for every special occasion just because they happen to be related to a professional baker. It sounds like they have no concept of how much time and effort goes into these cakes and don't understand that this isn't some fun little hobby you do because you just love it so gosh-darn much (which is probably why your mom assumed you'd make your own birthday cake. 'Cause it's so fun for you, right?) \n\nI'm truly sorry they have so little regard for the work you do.

They're a lot of work and I usually charge $200-250 for them. Thanks for understanding\" sometime before nephew's birthday party. Proving a point at the expense of a 7-year-old wasn't your finest hour.", "ESH. You know they were taking you for granted so you should have told your sister that you no longer could supply cakes on birthdays. This for the sake of your nephew who ended up getting fucked.", "I think you may be the AH in this situation. Have you ever spoken to your family about this? If not its quite likely they assume you enjoy doing this. Also I'm sure none of them ever expected an extravagant cake worth hundreds, just something delicious and beautiful made with love. We aren't talking about a wedding here, just an innocent 7 year old birthday. They shouldn't have assumed you'd turn up with a cake but if you knew that may have been the expectation then you should have said something", "if all this cake-making was going on without any discussion over these many years, they were well within their rights to expect that to continue. you set yourself up for that like flowers every friday. on the bright side, you have an opportunity to redefine your boundaries now. you'll need to make it up to the kid regardless. he's just a kid and you owe it to him if nobody else.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sounds like you have been making the cake for your nephew for the past 5 or 6 years without being asked to do so, is that correct? If it is I'd say YTA because it became an expectation at that point spoken or not. Your problem is with your sibling, not the nephew, and he was upset as a result.

You really picked a shitty way to make a very valid point, ESH.", "YTA and I think you know it because you acted out of anger and spite.

Your actions were passive aggressive.", "ESH - They shouldn't have assumed, buuuut ... if you've been doing it regularly for every single birthday before this, giving a heads-up would have made sense.  Honestly?  The first birthday you decided not to do a cake for was a 7 year old's?  Really?", "ESH.  Yes, she should have checked, and you're being taken for granted.  From the comments, you've initiated offering the cakes in the past, asking details.  It would have been polite and the right thing to do for them to check that a cake was coming, yes, but I could see a parent knowing something was already taken care of and imagining it checked off the list.  Maybe sister had no preference for a special character this year so she was just trusting you to make something you think he'd like.  Since you'd offered them before, it was up to you to communicate that now if people wanted cakes, they needed to order them through the shop, or they needed to ask with whatever parameters you wanted.\n\nIf they forgot your birthday completely, no gifts from any family, no happy birthday, nothing, that really sucks.  Express that and move forward how you want to.  Being passive aggressive with a cake is not going to solve things because there's a sad kid involved and they're (rightfully) focused on his feelings, too. \n\n  \nThough 24, I think family celebration of birthdays is on the adult having the birthday, unless the family has already established a tradition, like \"we'll make sure to take you out to dinner during your birthday month\" or \"we get together for coffee and cake for every birthday.\"  It is nice you've been making cakes for adults celebrating birthdays, but yes, you're expecting something in return for your gifts.  Birthday traditions among adult family members vary widely; I'd say it's smart to just establish your own and invite your family if you want to celebrate.  Generally, I celebrate by doing whatever I want that year and inviting who I want to come, I thought that was pretty typical for adults instead of expecting others to plan it, except maybe a surprise party for a milestone birthday.  If I wanted cake, I'd provide it, but usually I just don't do cake.  I see these expectations happen a little more among families that everyone lives close by so there's an expectation to gather and celebrate at homes, but even then it's ok to communicate about it.  \"We've been hosting family birthdays at your house, do you want to keep doing that?  If not, I can always make plans at (restaurant/my place) and you can join if you want.\"", "I\u2019m going to go with ESH except the nephew. \n\nAbsolutely you shouldn\u2019t feel like you have to bake a cake for everyone\u2019s birthday and you\u2019re being taken for granted.

He's happy to help his friends and family. Just depending on who you are, there might be an additional cost.

Your needs should be communicated, you should not expect others to just know. It\u2019s certainly unfair that you pay much attention to everyone\u2019s birthdays and that\u2019s not reciprocated. Sadly, because you decided to express your dissatisfaction (rightfully so) during your nephew\u2019s 7th birthday, you look like the AH (although you are not). Even more so because you set a precedent, so it\u2019s not odd (and you knew this too) that your sister expected a cake.", "NTA, it sucks that the family has taken OP for granted.

Op states that they have made cakes for every occasion for that the last few years so I can see how it kind of became an expectation. Op was clearly salty that people didn\u2019t remember their birthday (and I don\u2019t blame them) and decided to get back at them. Op should have said something not only so sis would have had time to organize a cake but because I think its important to speak up in the moment otherwise ppl don\u2019t know that you are upset by their behaviour. Nephew was the innocent party and was the one who ended up without a cake for his party. Sister is an AH for not confirming with op that she was baking a cake and just assuming. \nAlso if I was the sister I would have checked in with op and been like \u201care you sure you want to bake this year\u2026you\u2019ve been baking for x number for years, do you want to take a break this year\u201d.  \nSo in summary op is AH for not communicating and sabotaging a kids bday party to make a point and op\u2019s family are AHs for assuming that op is their own personal baker", "ESH - if the person you punished was an adult it would have been N T A but you *knew* that your 7 year old nephew was expecting a cake from you. \n\nIf you have unspoken brought cakes to every family event and now you decided not to because you reached your limit. That sucks.\n\nObviously your family sucks and you should never bring a cake again unless paid in advance.", "YTA, tiny one, it's understandable, but still an AS.

Did you know they would expect a cake?  \n\nYou're not an ah for not making one, but if you knew your nephew would wind up cakeless on his 7th birthday if you neglected to mention it, you're an ah.  You can't expect a 7 year old to remember your birthday, and he shouldn't be the one affected.  It's his mom's responsibility to get the cake, and she should have checked in with you, but you had set a precedent.  A heads up to prevent the nephew being the one punished would have prevented the ah territory.", "Sort of YTA. Not for not baking the cake - you were absolutely justified about that. But for not telling your sister in advance that you were not bringing a cake, so she could make other arrangements. You punished a 7 year old for the deeds of his older relatives. That is cruel and not fair.", "NTA. All of y\u2019all saying OP is TA for \u201csetting expectations\u201d\u2026out of your minds. When I started taking art more seriously in hs, I did the same thing. I would do commissions even then, yes, but at the time I would give a a couple painted or charcoal pieces to family for free. I was \u201csetting\u201d up anything, I was a child still learning and feeling out my craft, and I felt that a lot of my pieces still weren\u2019t good enough to charge for (I didn\u2019t know my worth). Also, I just wanted exposure and support from my family.\n\nI\u2019m graduating from my art college in about 10 school days, and in the past 4 years I\u2019ve gone here, the family members who demand the most art from me, the ones who unfairly request things knowing I was busy or stressed with assignments and art projects of my own, barely checked up on me. Barely called, and if they did it was to talk about a personal family issue between me and my estranged parent that isn\u2019t any of their business. The first people to always treat you like this when it comes to your craft is your family, especially if you come across as a pushover. Good for you for standing up for yourself OP, family does not equate to free labor.", "NTA, I am sorry you had to find out you were being taken advantage of like this.", "NTA - My sister worked as a baker and still makes cakes when asked for family gatherings.

If we want them to help us with a cake, we'll ask, and won't expect a cake if we didn't communicate", "ESH, just because you set up the expectation by always bringing one. You should have casually slipped into the conversation that you bought him a toy instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut forgetting your birthday was a dick move.", "Nta. They should ask you next time.", "Nta they should ask you next time", "NAH.  If you had established a pattern of always (every single time) arriving with a cake, it\u2019s not completely surprising your sister expected one for your nephew. No, she shouldn\u2019t have assumed, but you appear to have established a pattern, and you didn\u2019t communicate ahead of time you were breaking the pattern. Unfortunately, a 7-year old was caught in the middle of the poor communication between adults.\n\nI suggest you send out a message to all family members that you will no longer be providing free cakes.  Make it clear that the previously established pattern is now permanently broken.  If you want to address the way in which they left you out on your own birthday, go ahead and throw that relevant information in, but be prepared to accept apologies while remaining firm on how you\u2019re choosing to end the practice of providing free cakes.  Those are expensive cakes.  It was generous of you to make them, but that really wasn\u2019t sustainable over the long term, anyway.  If you get a lot of entitled crap from anyone, refuse to discuss it, tell them your decision is final (and their entitled attitude is ensuring you won\u2019t change your mind), and hang up or don\u2019t read the messages.\n\nI almost judged you as N T A, but I think your lack of communication makes your sister a little more sympathetic.", "Nta", "NTA.

The ignoring of your birthday shows that you are a cake maker to them, not someone to be treated with dignity and respect.", "Sounds like your family has come to rely on you and it's made them selfish and entitled.  \n\n\nIt's time to communicate any new expectations you may have, such as notifying you of a need and paying for materials (if not time). You could give them a steep 'family discount' to any who sided with you! The rest pay the material costs to the cent.  \n\n\nNTA, she should have verified and was lax in not doing so.", "NTA. Nobody even talked to you about it beforehand and then were mad at you for their own lack of planning", "NTA. Even if you\u2019d brought cakes a billion times before, she still should have confirmed. One text would have been enough.", "NTA. They're mad that they couldn't take advantage of your good nature without at least talking to you about it first.  Maybe the 7 year old wasn't the best family member to make your stand on, but you deserve to make your stand.", "NTA. You were taken for granted of.  Your parents, your family, should've showed more gratitude but obviously were too selfish once the free cake stopped flowing.", "You\u2019re 90% in the right, you were doing a big service for them all and they had begun to take it for granted but YTA for pulling this on a child\u2019s birthday who was faultless and not giving a heads up. Your sister or parents would have deserved it but not the little boy whose party got spoiled.", "Your assessment of the situation is correct.

It\u2019s totally fine you don\u2019t want to bake for your entitled family anymore but you\u2019re 24 babe, use your words. Your family is TA bc they\u2019re entitled and dense but you\u2019re also TA bc regardless if it was said you knew they expected you to bring a cake. Refusing to communicate that you weren\u2019t only ended up hurting your nephew and making you look like the villain to the rest of the family. You clearly have feelings about how your family regards you and your baking (and rightfully so), so instead of just passive aggressively not engaging, you should tell them how you feel (and set some boundaries too). The way you\u2019re currently going about it is only causing more hurt feelings for you (and now your nephew by extension).", "NTA. It\u2019s really weird of OP\u2019s sister to just expect her to show up with a cake without forward planning regardless of whether or not OP has made them for her family previously. If she was expecting a cake why didn\u2019t she (OP\u2019s sister) call to coordinate flavor choices, size, decorations etc.?

Just remove the ambiguities with dialogue.\n\nYour sister should have asked you out loud to bake her son a cake, rather than just \"expect\" you'd accepted the role of providing labor and expense with no compensation whatsoever. And you should not have picked a small child's birthday party to throw the gauntlet back in adult faces. ESH - except the kid.", "Kinda the A H but not really.  I'm going with NTA.  Family has gotten entitled.  They are rude for not doing anything for your birthday.  But if you know they expect you to bring a cake, kind of rude not to have told them before hand, especially when it was for nephew's 7th birthday but at the same time they should have asked you to make the cake.  What flavor cake, flavor icing, theme all goes into it and you making a $200 to $250 cake for a 7 year old would be too expensive.  Hopefully the entitlement will stop but I feel you should have warned them.", "NTA", "Nta. When you're in the service industry,  family tends to expect your services or products for free. Thays unfair to you because it costs time and money out of your own pocket. I would just make it known that if they want your cakes from now on, they have to pay. Tell them you were doing it for free before, because you needed practice and experience. But you're a pro now and you expect payment.", "NTA-I work in a bakery. I don\u2019t make my own birthday cakes either. A friend/coworker just had her birthday and guess what? She didn\u2019t make her birthday cake. I did for her as an act of love and friendship. \n\nIt is a gift to give someone a cake-not an expectation. If they expected it they should\u2019ve clarified they wanted a cake from you.

Why not tell sister in advance that OP was bringing a toy instead so sis has the chance to buy a cake.\n\nWould OP have gotten grief from sis about no cake? Maybe - but then OP can stand up for herself and explain she is hurt by their lack of caring towards her. \n\nThis passive aggressive move just move just makes her look shitty and earns her grief from not only sis but the whole family.
