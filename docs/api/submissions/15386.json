I\u2019ve started baking since high school and have been making birthday cakes for my family. It was a good way to let people know I bake, to get feedback and to experiment.

This year on my birthday I didn\u2019t have anything planned, didn\u2019t remind anyone that it was coming up. I was hoping at least one of them would remember and surprise me with something, but when I asked my mom if she bought a cake for me, she thought I would bake a cake for myself, on my birthday. I was hurt. I didn\u2019t make cakes wanting to get anything in return, but I realised I was being taken for granted. \n\nAfter a few months it was my nephew\u2019s 7th birthday. This time I decided to not bring a cake and instead bought him a toy he wanted. When I got to my sister\u2019s house, she asked me where the cake was. I told her I didn\u2019t bring one. She got mad at me, saying that she expected me to bring a cake and didn\u2019t order one from a shop. I told her that it wasn\u2019t my problem, she could\u2019ve asked me and ordered one from my bakery. \nMy nephew was crying that he didn\u2019t have a cake and my sister blamed me for making him sad on his birthday. \n\nAfter the birthday party, I had numerous relatives making me seem like the bad guy and ruining the party.

If no one had even asked you to bring a cake i don't see how this is your fault. Sounds like a few people in your family are being entitled brats (not the nephew).   \n\n\nAlso that sucks that you were expected to produce your own birthday cake. Rough.", "NTA\n\nThey Assumed you would make a cake and didnt bother to confirm you were actually making one. I would stop all together baking for family unless asked and Paid. No more freebees. Tell your family that you are no longer baking for free.", "Do people communicate in your family? How does the topic of a birthday cake for a child not come up from your sister? Oh yeah, I know, entitlement. You were being taken for granted. Don't feel bad for other people's delusions. Your family doesn't reciprocate what you do for them.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit: I'm seeing people say OP is the AH because of the 'expectation' she set by making cakes for family members in the past, and also that she 'punished' her nephew by not making the cake. I disagree with this point because OP indicated that she takes orders for custom cakes for family, and in this case her sister did not request a cake (or even discuss it with OP). And OP did not punish her nephew, especially since she got her nephew a present he wanted, which is more than she got for her own birthday. OPs sister deserves all the blame for poor planning, 100%. If it were my kid and my sister usually brought the same thing year after year, I'd still ask if they were going to because that's the reasonable thing to do when planning an event. I'd feel differently if OP hinted at making a cake, but that isn't what it says in the post. Her family feels entitled to OPs hard work by suggesting either of these things. It confirmed all her suspicions.", "NTA. It\u2019s very weird to me that she just assumed you would bring the cake. Even if you are normally the family cake baker, I\u2019m assuming there is usually at least some conversation in advance to talk about what the person wants. Birthday cakes are really important to kids that age so his parents should have been on top of it.", "Nta. They're taking you for granted. They could have at least asked you about the cake beforehand. You don't owe em anything.", "NTA, they didn't even talk to you about what kind of cake he might like. Just tell them you brought the same kind of cake they all brought for your birthday... air cake. For real, though. You're a busy person. People suck, and they shouldn't assume.\n\nI once offered a month in advance to order a cake for my niece's birthday, since they were coming from out of town. My brother and SIL didn't answer, so I figured they made another plan. Then they told our sister 3 days before the party that I was bringing the cake. If my sister hadn't told me, I never would have known, and then who would look like the big jerk? Did I mention that people suck?", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure if ESP is a hereditary thing, but how on earth could your sister be upset with you not doing something that wasn\u2019t asked of you?\n\nBeing taken for granted is one thing, but to just expect it to happen without even asking is another.", "NTA.\n\nShe had no right to just assume you would be making one. Even if you normally do. It's not your responsibility to make sure he had a cake.\n\nThat was also not very nice for your parents to think you would make your own cake. Thats just lazy on their part. Why should you do all the work on your birthday? I would be upset, too. \n\nOne year on my birthday, my dad told me he had a BDay card for me and to drive over and just let myself in their house and grab it when they weren't home...like seriously? \n\nEveryone wants to feel special on their birthday! They should have put in effort!", "NTA - You don't have to gift a cake if you don't want to. Their assumption that you would, without any evidence or confirmation, certainly affirms that they are taking the cakes for granted. They made their son sad by not making sure there would be a cake. Any of the people complaining could have asked you or provided a cake themselves. You gave a gift. That it wasn't the gift they wanted you to give is not your problem. You gave the gift you wanted to give, a toy you knew he wanted.", "NTA it\u2019s not your duty to provide the cake, especially without being asked to do so. making cakes is hard work, so expecting one for free also isn\u2019t fair. how would they feel if they were expected to work for free all the time?", "NTA\u2026kind of. Sure seems like your family was taking you for granted, even if they didn\u2019t realize that\u2019s what they were doing. That is terrible and I\u2019m really sorry. \n\nHOWEVER, kinda sucks your nephew ended up in the middle of it. This could\u2019ve easily been avoided by communicating with your sister in advance that your approach to birthdays would be changing or by choosing an adult\u2019s birthday to make your statement. \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely your sister\u2019s responsibility to ensure and not just expect a cake will appear at her son\u2019s party, but regardless, I can understand her line of thinking, even if it\u2019s inconsiderate. But bottom line, your nephew got the short end of the stick on this one.", "Nta. However, I think this was a good lesson to learn. Keep giving free stuff, and it'll just be expected. Your family was absolutely taking advantage of you. So, going forward, I would send everyone a message that if they want a cake from you, they can pay you the normal rate, and if they don't like it, then that's their problem. Your time should never have been free, but, being a professional in the industry myself, I 100% understand your sentiment. I've had family friends ask me to help them cater parties and as soon as I tell them \"sure, my rate is $20/hr plus the cost of food and any extra hands I need\" they immediately drop it.", "NTA. You're not responsible for every cake for every function. Its great that you've been willing to do it but it shouldn't be expected. It also seems like your family doesn't contribute for ingredients which can be expensive. I'd set a boundary \"I'm willing to make it if you cover ingredients but after nobody wanted to get me a cake for my birthday, I refuse to give you my work for free.\"", "NTA, very entitled and stupid of them to just assume, they're definitely taking you for granted.", "NTA You're being taken advantage of by your own family. From now on tell them if they expect a cake they need to order in advance and pay for it.", "NTA. I cannot get behind the E S H votes.  Your sister NEVER ASKED FOR A  CAKE. As the parent, it is her responsibility to ensure cake happens. She didn't. She assumed you'd bring a cake, but instead, your brought your nephew a toy. It's really easy to just run out and buy a cake from a store. You didn't punish your nephew in any way, and he probably got a cool toy out of it.", "NTA\n\nThe very idea is ludicrous.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI think it was kinda spiteful to do this on your nephew's birthday. He was innocent in all this. They should have confirmed you were bringing a cake. It's weird they didn't have any requests on what kind they wanted. It's on the parents to make sure there is cake if their kid wants cake.", "NTA in anyway. They didn't seem to care about your own birthday in any way. I know birthdays are a bigger deal for kids, but your sister didn't even have the decency to ask.", "NTA - even if she assumed, she should have told you what she wanted. Most people have a theme for their kid's birthday nowadays.", "INFO - Since it seems to be your thing to bring a cake to all family birthdays did you mention to anyone after your birthday that you were no longer to be counted on for cakes?  Was there any other function between your birthday/nephew's birthday which you brought one too?\n\nHowever even if you had not I find it a bit entitled to just expect a cake.  If I have a family member who normally contributes X, Y or Z to a party/family function I always check beforehand it is still okay to do so.  Expecting someone to turn up with a $200-$250 contribution without even clarifying it beforehand is insane.\n\nDid your sister not even discuss this with you beforehand?  No discussion of what she was planning on/theme for the cake/numbers she was catering for?\n\nWhat would have happened if you turned up with a cake that was too small for the number of people she invited?", "soft ESH. You let your nephew get caught in the middle of shitty adult behavior. Perhaps you could have made the kid's cake and then showed up empty-handed at the next adult family members birthday gathering?", "NTA Honestly I find their behavior ungrateful, and selfish. Some people just here to take and take without ever thinking of others. The emotional labor, financial hardship you\u2019ve been putting into all of their birthdays and they couldn\u2019t come together for yours is mind boggling. \n\nMy advice set boundaries now, if they want cakes, they can either order it through your services or find another baker. I feel bad for your nephews though. I understand your stance, the anger and disappointment in your family, as a child he wasn\u2019t to blame for any of it. Maybe you can make him a mini cake just for him.", "Don't make any more cakes for ingrates.", "I think they were taking you for granted but I do think making a small child\u2019s (I\u2019m assuming you care about) birthday the hill you die on is weird. You punish a child for your hurt feelings and what the adults did. Seems like a AH move to me", "You\u2019re NTA but a general, \u201clet me know if you want a cake\u201d email or group message might not have gone astray. I do think your family were taking advantage of you, 100%, but I still feel sorry for your nephew - he wasn\u2019t to know that you\u2019d set boundaries. I mean, it\u2019s good you\u2019ve set them now, don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s well justified, he just happened to be the first person to have to deal with the consequences. Either way, I hope things improve going forward.", "possibly an unpopular opinion, but ESH\n\nI understand your stance, however your approach resulted in you punishing your 7 year old nephew for something he didn\u2019t do. \n\nit\u2019s clear that it\u2019s a well established expectation in your family that you will bring a cake to birthday celebrations. we have something similar in my family - she doesn\u2019t make the cakes, but my grandmother always brings the cake for birthdays from a bakery she likes. it\u2019s just an unspoken tradition/expectation, and if she didn\u2019t show up with one one day out of nowhere, there would be no cake at the party. \n\ni completely understand where you\u2019re coming from, and i agree with you about not making the cakes anymore, but you should have communicated that you weren\u2019t bringing one and explained why so that the disappointment didn\u2019t fall onto the shoulders of a child on his birthday. \n\nand your family is obviously TA for not appreciating you.", "ESH.\n\nYour fam sucks for (basically) ignoring your bday.\n\nYou suck for choosing the 7 yo's bday to take a stand.\n\nYou've been making cakes (from the sound of it without being asked) for several times a year for years without saying anything so you contributed to that expectation.\n\nYou're mad at your fam but ruined the 7 yo's bday when the kids are the least culpable in your family not doing anything for your bday.\n\nA wiser choice would have been giving them a heads up in advance that you were no longer providing free cakes or sucked it up for the kid's bday and told them afterwards that was the last freebie.\n\nBdays mean a lot more when you're a kid", "ESH. You definitely are being taken advantage of. You go the extra mile for your family\u2019s birthdays and they don\u2019t even do the bare minimum for yours. \n\nThat being said, you set a precedent that you would bring a cake for these birthday parties. You knew that your sister was expecting you to bring one. You intentionally punished a 7 year old because of what his mom did. \n\nThere were much better ways to handle this that didn\u2019t involve intentionally hurting your nephew who you supposedly love.", "NTA sort of\n\nHOWEVER, you did set a precedence with your family by making cakes over the years. I understand why she\u2019d assume you\u2019d continue to do this. \n\nI\u2019d say maybe you could\u2019ve said something or she could\u2019ve asked. Either way it\u2019s her sons party and she\u2019s responsible for making sure there was a cake\n\nIt does seem a little spiteful since everyone forgot your birthday \n\nBut overall I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH since they were taking you for granted which is a terrible feeling", "**ESH**  \n\n>my sister blamed me for making him sad on his birthday. \n\nDid you tell her that you were sad on your own birthday?  There is nothing wrong with your decision to stop being responsible for the centerpiece of other people's birthday.  Your passive-aggressive move here, where you disappointed a child, was not the way to make your feelings known.   At the very least, you could have sent your a message to say that the family baking shop had closed and she needed to make plans for her son's birthday.  As it stands, the majority of your family doesn't understand why *they* were wrong and are blaming you for their own thoughtlessness.  \n\nI suggest writing your sister a note stating that you are sorry that the end date for being taking for granted fell on her son's birthday.  You need to tell your sister, your mom, and anyone who asks that your recent birthday, when on your birthday, you realized that it was time to stop baking cakes for others.", "ESH. Them for taking advantage of you and assuming that you will always provide cake free of charge. You because you didn\u2019t communicate your feelings to them, you just took action. Those actions left a disappointed child crying at his birthday party, you only person who is not an AH.", "ESH. I totally agree that your family has been taking you for granted. Your family are also not entitled to free professional-caliber cakes for every special occasion just because they happen to be related to a professional baker. It sounds like they have no concept of how much time and effort goes into these cakes and don't understand that this isn't some fun little hobby you do because you just love it so gosh-darn much (which is probably why your mom assumed you'd make your own birthday cake. 'Cause it's so fun for you, right?) \n\nI'm truly sorry they have so little regard for the work you do. But it sounds like \"Princess Mipha brings the birthday cakes\" has been the unspoken assumption in your family for awhile, unfair as that was.

They're a lot of work and I usually charge $200-250 for them. Thanks for understanding\" sometime before nephew's birthday party. Proving a point at the expense of a 7-year-old wasn't your finest hour.", "ESH. You know they were taking you for granted so you should have told your sister that you no longer could supply cakes on birthdays. This for the sake of your nephew who ended up getting fucked.", "I think you may be the AH in this situation. Have you ever spoken to your family about this? If not its quite likely they assume you enjoy doing this. Also I'm sure none of them ever expected an extravagant cake worth hundreds, just something delicious and beautiful made with love. We aren't talking about a wedding here, just an innocent 7 year old birthday. They shouldn't have assumed you'd turn up with a cake but if you knew that may have been the expectation then you should have said something", "if all this cake-making was going on without any discussion over these many years, they were well within their rights to expect that to continue. you set yourself up for that like flowers every friday. on the bright side, you have an opportunity to redefine your boundaries now. you'll need to make it up to the kid regardless. he's just a kid and you owe it to him if nobody else.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds from your story like you deliberately didn't, because you wanted them to *just know* that they should love you in the same way you have been loving them.
