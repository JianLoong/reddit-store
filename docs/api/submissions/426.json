If you are concerned about the well-being of a friend, and inquire about them to another friend, that should be done **one-on-one, in person, in real life.**\n\nAnd you should be doing it in order to HELP the person, not because you \"need to know\" or \"need to let others know.\"", "Not going to give a judgment because in teenage drama like this everyone is an asshole and no one is.\n\nLong, dramatic farewell texts like that never end well. The hard truth is you will never obtain the closure you seek. The only way to truly \"turn the page to a new life\" is to block them.", "ESH. Your 'friends' aren't really friends, they sound like horrible people. But you should never tell someone else's secret. Even if you think that the secret will never get back to the person it's about, it still can. It sounds like a very upsetting secret for her too. Yeah, you messed up.", "ESH you made a mistake telling people someone else's secret. Next time you don't want to be friends with someone just don't be friends with them. You don't need to do a big break up text. Also, check who is in a group chat next time.  \nYou live, you learn.", "OK I'm getting 'fake friend' vibes on here. I see the signs even in your post and must urge you to slowly drift apart from them. \nBlock them when you're ready but distant yourself from them, and as for sharing private info it was wrong of you to do that but I'd say ESH because all of you are in a teenage drama and I think this is where you should learn to be better than those \"friends\".\nYou need to apologise to that friend, and I just think see how they behave around you. But I do feel this friendship won't last because it feels like they are not treating well. \nJust be careful with that one friend and offer to help them, they need to appreciate your offer/help and stuff to show they are your friend - of it escalates then suggest professional help like therapy or counselling.\nYou do however have the right to back out slowly and so you feel comfortable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
