They were all accepting, which is a huge relief. I\u2019ve been dating my boyfriend, Michael (28M) for about 2 years now, so he\u2019s been meeting the family.\n\nMy sister \u201cJen\u201d (35F) has a son, \u201cBrent\u201d (5M). When I first came out, Jen asked me how to explain it to him. She was genuinely (to me anyway) trying to be a good ally. Brent hasn\u2019t been exposed to anyone openly gay before (at least that my sister and her husband are aware of), so I understood it\u2019d be a learning curve. I recommended some books, offered to talk to Brent, etc. She took me up on the book recommendations and said she\u2019d talk to him.\n\nMichael came to a family party not long after and he met Brent. I thought it went well. Brent didn\u2019t ask any questions, outside if Michael would play Mario Kart with him. They did and I thought it was super adorable.\n\nShortly after, Jen kept coming to me saying that Brent didn\u2019t understand why his uncle is dating a man, but our brother is married to a woman. I told her to tell him everyone is different. He\u2019s  5. It\u2019s okay if he doesn\u2019t fully grasp it.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly gotten a little tiring hearing about it. Brent himself never seems confused when Michael and I are around. He loves playing with both of us. If he truly is consistently asking Jen about it, it\u2019s not showing. \n\nThe final straw for me was when it happened yet again. Jen told me \u201cit\u2019s so hard as a mom. I have to keep explaining this to him and he\u2019s just so confused. I wish I had more time to ease him into this.\u201d\n\nI told her that I simply don\u2019t have sympathy for her. Yes, I acknowledge it\u2019s hard to be a parent and explain things in a child appropriate way\u2026but I\u2019m the wrong person to vent about this to. What would she like me to do? She understandably wants to handle it herself but I can\u2019t magically make my nephew understand, even if I did step in. I told her that it makes me feel like she\u2019s upset with me for \u201cexposing\u201d her son to this before she was ready.\n\nShe said this was an overreaction of my end but also refused to acknowledge the last part. I ended the conversation. Most of my family agrees with me but some say that I should just let Jen vent and that I need to be sympathetic. I just don\u2019t understand why she keeps coming to me and not vent to any of them?", "created_utc": 1680056413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125aa8c/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_dont_want_to_hear/", "score": 881, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I was a kid there were two, TWO, lesbian couples on our street and honestly I didn\u2019t fucking realize it until I was like 14. One of them even had kids from donor sperm. Just never really thought about it. Because my mom treated them exactly like every other couple on the street. Never tried to explain it and I never cared enough to ask. I assumed they were just close lady friends who lived together and I thought it was cool that you could buy a house with your friends. Then one day I saw them out riding their bikes and it just clicked like \u201coooooOOOOOHHHhhh they\u2019re gay. Cool. \u201d That\u2019s it. Apparently other parents on the street were acting like your sister when the one couple got pregnant like \u201chow are we gonna explain this to our kids?\u201d (we were all probably <10 at the time) and my mom was just like do they even understand enough about how straight couples make babies to question it?

I knew plenty of gay people when I was Brent's age, and the way my parents explained it was that some people fall in love with men, some people fall in love with women, and it's all fine and natural.   \nIt wasn't some big revelation for me, it was just totally normal that anyone can fall in love with anyone.

How excited I was to eat waffles. It was breakfast time and the way syrup falls into the little waffle squares was all I could think about. \n\nNow I'm gay and have neices and I'm pretty sure they know but it's no big deal and not really a topic of conversation. They mostly want to talk to us about Harry Potter and whatever thing they most recently created. \n\nKids don't care.

I may have questioned more that my uncle wasn\u2019t married to my cousins mom anymore, but not that he had a bf. \n\nKids that age absorb how parents act and mimic them.

You can also love whoever makes your heart happy.\" If you can't enthusiastically say the second part, a 5 year old is going to catch you not being willing to accept them if they model Cousin Nick's behavior.", "She is missing step two of the process, she can identify OP's romantic partner as their person, but she isn't saying its okay.

She questioned it before, saying but they're both girls (or boys), and i said so? Conversation done lol. I was actually watching drag race earlier and we talked about what that is. She just thought it was really cool that they got to be queens lol.  This is the easiest age for explaining it in my opinion. She's not ready to know about the hate and struggles and all that. Just love is love, and everyone is unique in their own way.\n\nAll that to say NTA.

It's like in the same vein as explaining, \"some people have dark skin, some people have light skin, and some people are somewhere's in between.\" Reality reflects this, boom. Not complicated. \n\nHowever, for some reason it's too complex to say, \"some men prefer to have another man in their life like mommy and daddy are in eachothers lives, and some women prefer another woman the same way.\"\n\nHonestly, I get the feeling this isn't even Brendt's doing. He's 5, the above explanation I gave was the kind of foundational simplification you expect them to go, \"oh,\" and go about their day over. Your sister meanwhile may be beating the hell out of the subject because she herself doesn't grasp it. As an adult she probably suffers from a massive degree of projection, much as many do, and can't fathom that her experiences aren't completely universal. She's probably over complicating the simple fact that you like/love men in a way akin to her, and that you don't feel for women the same way she's experienced from men. Again, it's not at all complicated, but she's likely making it complicated for herself.\n\nNTA", "The best explanations come from kids.\n\nMy 6yr old's birthday party with the neighborhood kids. 7 yr old Joey asked my daughter \"why does your mom have a lady as the other person?\" he didn't have the words for partner or girlfriend.\n\nMy daughter explained in that authoritative certain way of children when they know things:\n\n\"Boys can love boys, and girls can love girls, they just can't make babies\"\n\nJoey gave that a thought, shrugged his shoulders and said \"OK\"\n\nI have no idea where my daughter came up with the explanation.

It's not the kid that's looking for an explanation, it's your sister who's struggling.", "NTA.  The explanation I used was to explain that it was like being right or left handed.  Some people are born one way or the other and some are even born both handed (I am amphitdextrous so this is helpful, I knit with both hands, write with my right and do things like throw pottery with my left).  Being left-handed isn't bad, just not right handed, and right handed is just fine too, just not left.  It is just the way they are. Now explain that who you like isn't tied to handedness so analogies don't get confused with facts.\n\n(Best part is that the handedness idea later explains bi and can explain antigay ideas as historical ideas on lefties.)", "NTA and I'm sorry, but I think your sister is exhibiting some kind of twisted thinking that if she keeps harping on how hard it is to explain your relationship to your nephew you'll give up on the relationship and suddenly decide to be straight.

She wants to be supportive, but maybe she can't grasp it herself, somewhere subconsciously?", "NTA and your sister is either weird or homophobic.\n\nMy kiddo does not even have any LGBTQ family members, but I made it a point from the very beginning to teach him that love is love, sometimes boys love girls and sometimes they love boys or both. When we played Game of Life together, and he came on the field where he gets married, I always asked him if he wanted a blue or a pink figure for his car; I never assumed one over the other. Just like I explained to him even when he was little that sometimes there are people whose brains are more \u201cgirl brains\u201d, but they are in \u201cboy bodies\u201d or the other way around, and they sometimes need some help when they are older to make their bodies match their brains so they are happier. \n\nYou can explain all of these things to a 5 years old, and most will take note and then go back to whatever they were playing before. And I think that it is really important to have those conversations early on with kids to normalize that those things exist, no matter if you currently have LGBTQ family members or not. You never know what kind of sexuality your own child might have later, and by normalizing it early on, hopefully it will lead to less mental health issues and more self love along the way, no matter who your kids will end up loving one day.", "I think your sister has a secret problem with it. 5 year old don't care.", "NTA I explained to our 5yr old that families looked different and not everyone has a mommy and a daddy and how some people have two daddy\u2019s or two mommy\u2019s. We explained that not everyone wants to have kids and that\u2019s ok that it\u2019s a personal choice and we told him that he can love anyone he wants. You know what he said?\u201d oh, that\u2019s cool mom. Wanna play a game?\u201d I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hard for her kid to understand and honestly I have a lot of doubts that he\u2019s asking any questions because most 5yr olds at this point would also be directly asking you questions especially if you\u2019re close to the kid and have a good relationship. Kids don\u2019t sugarcoat things hahah he would likely just straight out ask you. I think maybe she\u2019s just struggling and trying to put it off on her kid. No matter what though, you are NTA. It isn\u2019t hard to explain I\u2019ve had to do it multiple times.", "Literally at that age, I learned about gay couples. My mom's co-worker came with us to chucky cheese, and he brought his partner. I remember asking my mom and her co-worker & partner what they were. My mom explained to me that just like her and my dad were married b/c of love, that her co-worker and partner were together because of love. \n\nI took that and was content. No confusion.", "It's really not that complicated.  When my daughter was 5 or 6 we found ourselves in a situation where we had to explain to her.  My husband just told her \"you know how me and mommy love each other ?\" She says yes and he said \"sometimes two boys or two girls love each other the same way.\" She accepted that, she's 16 now, no further explanation has been required.", "No offense but it sounds like it\u2019s your sister that has a problem with it.", "Agreed. I call bullshit. My (almost) 5 year old has said at different points that he plans to marry me, his sister and his stuffies. They don't have a lot of preconceived notions about romantic relationships.", "What is there to explain?", "Yh his sister seems really off", "NTA.  Kids of 5 don\u2019t understand that what hetero marriage is either. They don\u2019t get concerned unless they pick up that their parents are uncomfortable .", "This. I have three gay friends, one of whom is a lesbian dating a woman and the other is gay dating a man (third is bi and single), and two children. My two (almost 3) year old understands her daddy's friend lives with his fiance, who just happens to be a man. She understands my friend has a girlfriend, and that's about it. I think I've been asked once if they were \"two mummy's\" and I just explained they weren't mother's because they didn't have kids, she went: \"Ok mummy\" and that was literally it. She doesn't care, she's 2. Why on earth would a literal child care about who someone is having sex with? They care about Paw Patrol and how many sweets they can sneak out of their grandparents before their parents catch them.", "oh lord, my heart\n\nThe band aids....", "I remember being 5 or 6 and hating to have only one word on a line in writing. I was also worried it'd be lonely.", "Lol I was gonna say this is just how children are and mom feeling exhausted at all the questioning isn't even a gay thing. My 5 year old nephew had his first pet fish die and the next week was trying to explain death followed by non stop questions \"but where do we go?\" \"Where's heaven?\" \"What street is heaven on?\" \"What's stopping me from visiting my fish?\"\n\nIt's just a joy of being a parent. Not on OP to explain. My grandma came as gay before I was born so as young as I can remember she had a \"close friend\" she lived with and it wasn't until I was like 7 or 8 it properly clicked and I could comprehend how relationships worked. But that was the same for straight couples in the family too.", "I mean.

Most recently, we went to a gay wedding in the family and my dad asked what to do if they asked us to wave the pride flags that were with every program. I asked if he seriously was considering not waving a price flag if the brides asked him to and he responded with \"well, not *enthusiastically*!\" And he was being honored with a place in the procession as a step grandfather at this wedding. \"Trying\" can be an excuse for microaggressions.", "> But good news is that because she's venting this to you and not others it indicates that she really is trying to be acceptive and understand...

It's likely the sister not the nephew feels blindsided and is struggling to wrap her head around this shift in her perception of her brother.

My son got angry, saying that I told him that wasn't possible and it wasn't ok to say that. I was aghast- I would never say or think that! Turns out, he was mad because he thought I had been lying to him about how babies were made -with genes from both a female and male person. Once I told him that babies were still made that way, but people could be married to the same sex, he said 'ok. That makes sense.'", "Yup. My then 3 year old saw two guys kissing on tv, asked me why.

They never married but it was kinda like they were just close friends that lived together. It wasn't even until I was older like 8 or so it clicked together. Nobody explained \"they're dating and different\" it was just a thing and how our family was. Nobody cared, I didn't care. They're still together and we treat them like any other couple in the family. There's also been other family members who've come home and brought a same gender partner to the family and everyone just carried on as normal. There was never a \"coming out\" or a big shock or gossip. It was just extremely normalised, the same way straight couples are. I feel really grateful I grew up in a family like that and not one where people feel a pressure to come out or make an announcement and scared they'll be rejected.", "> And storms have parents; \u201cgo away storm!

And super super common to say something like that when really young. My little sister wanted to marry our mom when she was 3 lol. The only kind of love kids know or understand at that point is the love you have for your family. It\u2019s so cute that he sees his sister as someone he loves and couldn\u2019t be without.
