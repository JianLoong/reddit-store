They were all accepting, which is a huge relief. I\u2019ve been dating my boyfriend, Michael (28M) for about 2 years now, so he\u2019s been meeting the family.\n\nMy sister \u201cJen\u201d (35F) has a son, \u201cBrent\u201d (5M). When I first came out, Jen asked me how to explain it to him. She was genuinely (to me anyway) trying to be a good ally. Brent hasn\u2019t been exposed to anyone openly gay before (at least that my sister and her husband are aware of), so I understood it\u2019d be a learning curve. I recommended some books, offered to talk to Brent, etc. She took me up on the book recommendations and said she\u2019d talk to him.\n\nMichael came to a family party not long after and he met Brent. I thought it went well. Brent didn\u2019t ask any questions, outside if Michael would play Mario Kart with him. They did and I thought it was super adorable.\n\nShortly after, Jen kept coming to me saying that Brent didn\u2019t understand why his uncle is dating a man, but our brother is married to a woman. I told her to tell him everyone is different. He\u2019s  5. It\u2019s okay if he doesn\u2019t fully grasp it.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly gotten a little tiring hearing about it. Brent himself never seems confused when Michael and I are around. He loves playing with both of us. If he truly is consistently asking Jen about it, it\u2019s not showing. \n\nThe final straw for me was when it happened yet again. Jen told me \u201cit\u2019s so hard as a mom. I have to keep explaining this to him and he\u2019s just so confused. I wish I had more time to ease him into this.\u201d\n\nI told her that I simply don\u2019t have sympathy for her. Yes, I acknowledge it\u2019s hard to be a parent and explain things in a child appropriate way\u2026but I\u2019m the wrong person to vent about this to. What would she like me to do? She understandably wants to handle it herself but I can\u2019t magically make my nephew understand, even if I did step in. I told her that it makes me feel like she\u2019s upset with me for \u201cexposing\u201d her son to this before she was ready.\n\nShe said this was an overreaction of my end but also refused to acknowledge the last part. I ended the conversation. Most of my family agrees with me but some say that I should just let Jen vent and that I need to be sympathetic. I just don\u2019t understand why she keeps coming to me and not vent to any of them?", "created_utc": 1680056413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125aa8c/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_dont_want_to_hear/", "score": 516, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I was a kid there were two, TWO, lesbian couples on our street and honestly I didn\u2019t fucking realize it until I was like 14. One of them even had kids from donor sperm. Just never really thought about it. Because my mom treated them exactly like every other couple on the street. Never tried to explain it and I never cared enough to ask. I assumed they were just close lady friends who lived together and I thought it was cool that you could buy a house with your friends. Then one day I saw them out riding their bikes and it just clicked like \u201coooooOOOOOHHHhhh they\u2019re gay. Cool. \u201d That\u2019s it. Apparently other parents on the street were acting like your sister when the one couple got pregnant like \u201chow are we gonna explain this to our kids?\u201d (we were all probably <10 at the time) and my mom was just like do they even understand enough about how straight couples make babies to question it?

I knew plenty of gay people when I was Brent's age, and the way my parents explained it was that some people fall in love with men, some people fall in love with women, and it's all fine and natural.   \nIt wasn't some big revelation for me, it was just totally normal that anyone can fall in love with anyone.

I may have questioned more that my uncle wasn\u2019t married to my cousins mom anymore, but not that he had a bf. \n\nKids that age absorb how parents act and mimic them.

You can also love whoever makes your heart happy.\" If you can't enthusiastically say the second part, a 5 year old is going to catch you not being willing to accept them if they model Cousin Nick's behavior.", "She is missing step two of the process, she can identify OP's romantic partner as their person, but she isn't saying its okay.

She questioned it before, saying but they're both girls (or boys), and i said so? Conversation done lol. I was actually watching drag race earlier and we talked about what that is. She just thought it was really cool that they got to be queens lol.  This is the easiest age for explaining it in my opinion. She's not ready to know about the hate and struggles and all that. Just love is love, and everyone is unique in their own way.\n\nAll that to say NTA.

It's like in the same vein as explaining, \"some people have dark skin, some people have light skin, and some people are somewhere's in between.\" Reality reflects this, boom. Not complicated. \n\nHowever, for some reason it's too complex to say, \"some men prefer to have another man in their life like mommy and daddy are in eachothers lives, and some women prefer another woman the same way.\"\n\nHonestly, I get the feeling this isn't even Brendt's doing. He's 5, the above explanation I gave was the kind of foundational simplification you expect them to go, \"oh,\" and go about their day over. Your sister meanwhile may be beating the hell out of the subject because she herself doesn't grasp it. As an adult she probably suffers from a massive degree of projection, much as many do, and can't fathom that her experiences aren't completely universal. She's probably over complicating the simple fact that you like/love men in a way akin to her, and that you don't feel for women the same way she's experienced from men. Again, it's not at all complicated, but she's likely making it complicated for herself.\n\nNTA", "The best explanations come from kids.\n\nMy 6yr old's birthday party with the neighborhood kids. 7 yr old Joey asked my daughter \"why does your mom have a lady as the other person?\" he didn't have the words for partner or girlfriend.\n\nMy daughter explained in that authoritative certain way of children when they know things:\n\n\"Boys can love boys, and girls can love girls, they just can't make babies\"\n\nJoey gave that a thought, shrugged his shoulders and said \"OK\"\n\nI have no idea where my daughter came up with the explanation.

It's not the kid that's looking for an explanation, it's your sister who's struggling.", "NTA.  The explanation I used was to explain that it was like being right or left handed.  Some people are born one way or the other and some are even born both handed (I am amphitdextrous so this is helpful, I knit with both hands, write with my right and do things like throw pottery with my left).  Being left-handed isn't bad, just not right handed, and right handed is just fine too, just not left.  It is just the way they are. Now explain that who you like isn't tied to handedness so analogies don't get confused with facts.\n\n(Best part is that the handedness idea later explains bi and can explain antigay ideas as historical ideas on lefties.)", "NTA and I'm sorry, but I think your sister is exhibiting some kind of twisted thinking that if she keeps harping on how hard it is to explain your relationship to your nephew you'll give up on the relationship and suddenly decide to be straight.

Tell her to vent to someone else!", "Jen is projecting herself onto her son. A 5 year old doesn't usually care. Your sister on the other hand seems to have a real problem and is using her son as a cat's paw to express it. Ask how you should have eased into it and how long you should have stayed in closet, unable to invite your BF over to meet the family, so she was comfortable? Wait until the nephew is 10,15?", "NTA.\nMy Uncle is gay and lives with His Partner since 30 years. I am 20. When i was 4 my mother explained to me that they live together because they love each other and i understood that perfectly fine. My ONLY Problem was, that my other Uncle lived with them for a Long Time, and didnt understood wich are the Partners and wich are the Brothers \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.\n(I found Out when i was 11 lol)", "NTA. I *think* she is using this to make it about herself. Talk yourself to your nephew. I don't think he is having that much of a hard time.", "NTA she has issues with it and is projecting it onto her son, kids aren't homophobic by nature there accepting. My neices and nephews have no issues understanding people love who they love. And my nephew's are 4+5.", "NTA\nShe's projecting and using the child as an excuse for her own homophobia. 5 year olds don't care unless they've been coached by parents to care.", "NTA\n\nWhat's hard to explain?\n\nWhen she tells her son that she's his mother, does she need to explain how many times she had sex to conceive him?! NO\n\nDoes she explain HOW every heterosexual couple they meet has sex? NO\n\nWhat's hard about two people being a couple? I bet she has no problem making marriage jokes about his fellow 5 y.o. girl friends.", "I'll never understand this. It's really super easy to explain to children. Some guys have a boyfriend and some have a girlfriend. Some ladies have a girlfriend and some have a boyfriend. \nSome families have a mummy and a daddy, and some have two mummies or two daddies. Every family is different. There's even people who are in between a girl and a boy! Isn't the world wonderful!\nNTA sorry your sister sux at explaining normal things to her child.", "Neither is wrong. She's venting to you because you are the one that could understand. Just let it go. The boy doesn't need anymore explaining done. She's just over thinking it. Congrats on your acceptance by your family!", "Nta ( no one likes being vented to unless they offer to be the sounding board) I would say from what I read it's not your nephew having the issues because I guarantee if he was he would be asking you himself. Kids aren't shy about asking questions. I think it's your sister having a hard time with it and is wanting to understand for herself using her son as the excuse to vent and ask questions. I would recommend asking her what she would like to know for herself to better explain it to her son. Just keep up the facade of the nephew being curious or not understanding.", "NTA. She doesn't get it.. the 5 year old understands just fine.", "NTA\n\nBut I have to say that I don't think it's your nephew who has a problem with it.", "NTA ease into what? \"Both your auntie and uncle have a boyfriend each.\" There, job done. That's as much as a five year old needs to know. No explanation of jiggery pokery necessary.", "NTA. I doubt the kid is putting a lot of thought into it. Around about when I was 5 one of my uncles got divorced and the other got married. I don\u2019t remember either being big events in my life (other than being jealous of not getting to be a flower girl \ud83d\ude1c) Another uncle was gay (shock horror in the 80s!) and I don\u2019t think we saw a difference between Uncle Peter bringing Uncle Rick to family bbqs and Uncle Stephen\u2019s multiple post divorc\u00e9 girlfriends or any of the other honorary aunts and uncles about the place (our parents friends) \nAs kids they were just other adults in the backyard at bbqs or Christmas lunch.", "Your nephew's not asking these questions no 5-year-old goes around asking why is my aunt married to this person why is my uncle married to this person no 5-year-old cares about that or even thinks about that this is all your sister asking all these questions it's all her and in her head all your nephew cares about is when you're around and your boyfriend's around is that you're playing with him and giving him attention love you nephew and you'll be good with him your sister on the other hand don't know how to help her", "From how he\u2019s not seeming confused around you and your bf, are you *sure* your sister spoke with him? \n\nKids that age are like sponges, they take everything in and ask if they\u2019re confused, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here.  \n\nOf course you\u2019re NTA, and your nephew obviously loves you.  Maybe suggest your sister has the chat with you there too, that way you can answer any questions he has", "Yeah, your nephew is not the one who is having a hard time with it, it is your sister. At 5, kids are completely accepting of things. My sister in law is a lesbian and my children have had zero difficulties with understanding the idea that she is married to a woman and just like mummy and daddy are married. It is your sister who is struggling with you being gay. It might not be because she has a problem with it, just that she didn't know for so long and is looking at all your experiences together and feels like she should have known or she wishes you could have told her sooner and maybe you not telling her means you guys aren't as close as she thought etc. I would have a chat with her about it.", "I\u2019m trans and when I came out my little nibblings had a few questions but overall they didn\u2019t care at all because little kids are fairly accepting. I think your sister is projecting", "NTA Been openly gay my entire life and I\u2019m trans never once has a kid struggled with this information your sister is homophobic and using her child as an excuse to be open about it with you.", "NTA. The conversation with my niece and nephew went like this: sometimes boys marry girls and sometimes girls marry each other. Like Auntie JoJo and Auntie (my wife). \n\nNephew - wanna see my pokemon cards? I got a\u2026.\n\nAlso. OMG do I hate pokemon. It\u2019s like crack for kids.", "NTA. My aunt is gay and in the 90s my mom sat me down to explain the relationship she has with her 'friend'. I was like 6, and I was like, oh ok. That was is it. My mom explained to me what being a lesbian or gay was and I went back to doing what I was doing. \n\nJen is making this more complicated. Brent doesn't care.", "NTA. My son was 5 when my sister told us all she was gay. My son asked what gay meant - we said a man who loves a man or a woman who loves a woman the way mummy and daddy love each other. His response, cool. He was never confused. Seems like your sister is the one with a problem.", "NTA! Your sister seems to be projecting. A 5-year old does not care or judge who is dating who (as in genders) unless he has been taught to do that by his parents (which doesn\u2019t even seem to be the case here because of the way he acts towards OP and his partner).", "If the child were confused he\u2019d ask you direct. He\u2019s 5. Your sister is not the ally you think she is.", "I thought the kid was going to be a teenager who was homophobic - when OP said that he was FIVE, I actually laughed. \n\nWhen I was five I thought my aunt was married to my grandfather (because she was single and lived with him). The entire world is confusing to five year olds, and for this reason, explaining same-sex marriage to them is no more complicated than explaining anything else! \n\nOP, for some reason your sister wants to make a big drama out of this. Ignore, ignore. NTA", "Damn, you made that explanation so easy to understand that I'm almost certain the sister is over explaining relationships to a 5 year old.", "Has she fully explained the birds and the bees to the five-year-old, no, because the child is too young, doesn't understand and doesn't care.", "NTA. And jumping onto this comment to add that if the child is not displaying any issues in your presence, he's not doing it in private. This is your sister's issue and she needs to stop projecting it onto her son. Now, I'm not saying she's doing this maliciously, she may very well be true unconscious projection causing her to read into behaviors things that aren't there", "Kids do get confused and ask a lot of questions about things they don't see as typical. The mom feels uncomfortable explaining this to her kid but she just needs to keep it simple instead of freaking out. \n\nShe's not making it complicated. It's a complicated world and explaining this stuff to kids is simple in theory but not in practice.\n\nHe needs to remind her to worry less about s - e - x and just focus on the relationship.", "Agreed, literally don't understand what the problem is. My step daughter was 4 when she attended my friend's lesbian wedding with us. It literally took one conversation of \"boys can love boys, girls can love girls the same way boys and girls can love each other. Just like daddy and [stepmom]\" and she was like oh okay then. That was the end of the conversation. I don't understand why it needs more than that? We also watch programs which represent lgbt characters too (Shout out to Neighbours, anyone?) Which helps the conversation sometimes", "This, and if she needs to vent her own issues, fine, but you're not the right person for her to vent to. NTA", "Yup. Gay relationships are really easy to explain *if you're not a homophobe*. Since they inject all sorts of weirdness and bigotry into their explanations, that's what makes it \"complicated\".", "The kid knows about opposite sex relationships. No one\u2019s suggesting they go into more sexual detail just because it\u2019s two men.", "You don\u2019t think kids should know about love?", "Basically what I told my kids and shockingly they got it immediately. I don't understand people acting like it is difficult to talk to kids about this. It's always the biased adults who have the difficulty, not the kids.", "Yeah, my 4year old has more problems understanding that he cannot marry various family members than that there are gay relationships, but he also wants to have 13 children and be a soccer player by day, firefighter at night so maybe he is just extra. Jen is projecting.", "Takeaways!", "Yeah. My daughter is 6 and homosexuality was easier to explain than racism.", "same in my family. but then this lead to me asking my mom if she\u2019ll marry me when i grow up and she shot me down hard :(", "Yep. \n\nMy 5yo: \u201cDaddy, what does being gay mean?\u201d\nMe: \u201cMostly, boys fall in love with girls and girls fall in love with boys. If a boy falls in love with another boy, or a girl falls in love with another girl, that\u2019s called being gay\u201d. \nMy 5yo:  \u201cok\u201d. \n\nAnd that was it.", "The age appropriate explanation for a 5 year old is really easy IMO.\n\nHere's your uncle, here's your uncle's BF. And explanation over.", "Uuugh. Trying to explain racism to a 4 or 5 year old (why are the tough questions at bedtime?) is not easy. My daughter really liked a picture book about [MLK](https://a.co/d/9WWV3HJ) but couldn't understand why POC were mistreated in the story. Love is easier to explain than hate.", "The hardest thing for me is getting my kid to understand that she can't marry her brother.", "That\u2019s basically exactly how I explained it to my 5 and 8 year olds. It took them 5 seconds to get it", "Lol. The hardest Thing for my mother to explain to me was, that im Not married to the 3 Boys and 1 Girl that Kissed me when i was 6 (one friend Kissed me and screamed now im married to you, and the others wanted to marry me too, lol)", "Yep that\u2019s how I explained it to my kids too. It\u2019s not difficult."]}
