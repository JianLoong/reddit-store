They were all accepting, which is a huge relief. I\u2019ve been dating my boyfriend, Michael (28M) for about 2 years now, so he\u2019s been meeting the family.\n\nMy sister \u201cJen\u201d (35F) has a son, \u201cBrent\u201d (5M). When I first came out, Jen asked me how to explain it to him. She was genuinely (to me anyway) trying to be a good ally. Brent hasn\u2019t been exposed to anyone openly gay before (at least that my sister and her husband are aware of), so I understood it\u2019d be a learning curve. I recommended some books, offered to talk to Brent, etc. She took me up on the book recommendations and said she\u2019d talk to him.\n\nMichael came to a family party not long after and he met Brent. I thought it went well. Brent didn\u2019t ask any questions, outside if Michael would play Mario Kart with him. They did and I thought it was super adorable.\n\nShortly after, Jen kept coming to me saying that Brent didn\u2019t understand why his uncle is dating a man, but our brother is married to a woman. I told her to tell him everyone is different. He\u2019s  5. It\u2019s okay if he doesn\u2019t fully grasp it.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly gotten a little tiring hearing about it. Brent himself never seems confused when Michael and I are around. He loves playing with both of us. If he truly is consistently asking Jen about it, it\u2019s not showing. \n\nThe final straw for me was when it happened yet again. Jen told me \u201cit\u2019s so hard as a mom. I have to keep explaining this to him and he\u2019s just so confused. I wish I had more time to ease him into this.\u201d\n\nI told her that I simply don\u2019t have sympathy for her. Yes, I acknowledge it\u2019s hard to be a parent and explain things in a child appropriate way\u2026but I\u2019m the wrong person to vent about this to. What would she like me to do? She understandably wants to handle it herself but I can\u2019t magically make my nephew understand, even if I did step in. I told her that it makes me feel like she\u2019s upset with me for \u201cexposing\u201d her son to this before she was ready.\n\nShe said this was an overreaction of my end but also refused to acknowledge the last part. I ended the conversation. Most of my family agrees with me but some say that I should just let Jen vent and that I need to be sympathetic. I just don\u2019t understand why she keeps coming to me and not vent to any of them?", "created_utc": 1680056413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125aa8c/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_dont_want_to_hear/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s being dramatic and obnoxious. Honestly I\u2019m so fucking tired of parents expecting the world to revolve around what they personally feel comfortable with and capable of explaining to their kids. The world doesn\u2019t care. Put on your big girl panties and teach your children how to cope with the world. Also, he\u2019s 5. He has NO concept of what is or is not \u201cnormal\u201d in the world.

When I was a kid there were two, TWO, lesbian couples on our street and honestly I didn\u2019t fucking realize it until I was like 14. One of them even had kids from donor sperm. Just never really thought about it. Because my mom treated them exactly like every other couple on the street. Never tried to explain it and I never cared enough to ask. I assumed they were just close lady friends who lived together and I thought it was cool that you could buy a house with your friends. Then one day I saw them out riding their bikes and it just clicked like \u201coooooOOOOOHHHhhh they\u2019re gay. Cool. \u201d That\u2019s it. Apparently other parents on the street were acting like your sister when the one couple got pregnant like \u201chow are we gonna explain this to our kids?\u201d (we were all probably <10 at the time) and my mom was just like do they even understand enough about how straight couples make babies to question it? All of us went to good colleges and are functional adults so as far as I can tell it didn\u2019t confuse us too much.", "NTA. If \"Jen\" keeps it up, just tell her to talk to a child psychologist or someone in that field. Maybe they can give some insight into how she can better explain it to her son. Other than that, just keep reiterating that you and Michael love each other the same way his mom and dad love each other (assuming they're married). As he gets older, he'll understand more. It's definitely an age thing. I wonder if your sister is the one who's actually struggling and just using your nephew as a shield.", "NTA. It's not that Brent is confused, it's that Jen isn't really an ally. Jen is probably the one confusing him, if anything.", "NTA- The kid might be confused genuinely, but right now all he needs to know is Uncle growleybear is with a nice man named Michael. He likes Mario Kart and Uncle growley so he's cool. I genuinely think that the more time he spends with you two will help him at least reach the conclusion that Mr. Michael loves Uncle growley and I might not understand it yet, but I'm happy for Uncle growley. He'll stop asking questions at some point.", "NTA. I knew plenty of gay people when I was Brent's age, and the way my parents explained it was that some people fall in love with men, some people fall in love with women, and it's all fine and natural.   \nIt wasn't some big revelation for me, it was just totally normal that anyone can fall in love with anyone. Honestly, I just remember being super jealous that some people got to have two mommies and I only had one.  \nYour sister is working herself up over absolutely nothing.", "I'm pretty sure I was about this kids age when I learned I had gay cousins. \n\nYou know what I remember from that conversation? How excited I was to eat waffles. It was breakfast time and the way syrup falls into the little waffle squares was all I could think about. \n\nNow I'm gay and have neices and I'm pretty sure they know but it's no big deal and not really a topic of conversation. They mostly want to talk to us about Harry Potter and whatever thing they most recently created. \n\nKids don't care. He was probably more concerned about Mario kart than anything else. \n\nYou're NTA. I'd also politely let her know that you're not a parent and thus have no advice on parenting her kid and if her kid is that dense, she should maybe revisit it at a later date.", "NTA. My son never had any confusion because I have queer friends and acknowledged from his birth that some people are straight, some are gay, some are bi/pan, and some are ace. He\u2019s never had a moment of confusion. \n\nDid your sister expect (edit typo) that her son would NEVER meet an LGBTQ person???", "OP you are NTA. I\u2019ve seen parents make things complicated when kids seem to grasp their versions of what was going on without confusion.\n\nI was 5 when I found out my uncle was gay. I also met his bf at the time and all I can remember from that time is that I thought he was super nice to me since he made me a Shirley Temple drink. My mom never had to explain anything to me since they acted like there was no difference to their relationship and my mom/stepdads relationship. I may have questioned more that my uncle wasn\u2019t married to my cousins mom anymore, but not that he had a bf. \n\nKids that age absorb how parents act and mimic them.

My wife and I have been together for 15 years, our relationship predates 4 out of 5 niblings.", "I would bet money that the kid understands just fine, a simple \u201cuncle Jim and Michael are together just like mommy and daddy are together\u201d is more than enough for a kid that age to comprehend. This feels more like Jen is the one not understanding or able to come to terms with it, but blaming her child to save face.", "It sounds like she's messing up the explanation, right? Too many details or too much hand wringing. Like she's trying to be tolerant *but not* accepting.\n\nMy kid has friends with gay parents, gay family friends and gay cousins. We say, \"Cousin Nick loves Matt like Mom loves Dad. You can also love whoever makes your heart happy.\" If you can't enthusiastically say the second part, a 5 year old is going to catch you not being willing to accept them if they model Cousin Nick's behavior.", "She is missing step two of the process, she can identify OP's romantic partner as their person, but she isn't saying its okay. That is why there are more questions. When she won't bring herself to be accepting and say \"love is love\" she is confusing the situation because now kiddo needs to know if this new relationship pattern is okay.", ">but she isn't saying its okay.\n\nI really think you're dead on here.  Explaining gayness was no big deal for us because we treated it like a normal thing. \n\n\"Why is Auntie E married to Auntie G and not to Uncle K?\"\n\n\"Because she loves Auntie G like mommy and daddy love each other. Also, Uncle K is her brother, and you can't marry your brother.\"\n\nHonestly, explaining homophobia was harder than explaining queerness, and it sucks that we even still have to."]}
