They were all accepting, which is a huge relief. I\u2019ve been dating my boyfriend, Michael (28M) for about 2 years now, so he\u2019s been meeting the family.\n\nMy sister \u201cJen\u201d (35F) has a son, \u201cBrent\u201d (5M). When I first came out, Jen asked me how to explain it to him. She was genuinely (to me anyway) trying to be a good ally. Brent hasn\u2019t been exposed to anyone openly gay before (at least that my sister and her husband are aware of), so I understood it\u2019d be a learning curve. I recommended some books, offered to talk to Brent, etc. She took me up on the book recommendations and said she\u2019d talk to him.\n\nMichael came to a family party not long after and he met Brent. I thought it went well. Brent didn\u2019t ask any questions, outside if Michael would play Mario Kart with him. They did and I thought it was super adorable.\n\nShortly after, Jen kept coming to me saying that Brent didn\u2019t understand why his uncle is dating a man, but our brother is married to a woman. I told her to tell him everyone is different. He\u2019s  5. It\u2019s okay if he doesn\u2019t fully grasp it.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly gotten a little tiring hearing about it. Brent himself never seems confused when Michael and I are around. He loves playing with both of us. If he truly is consistently asking Jen about it, it\u2019s not showing. \n\nThe final straw for me was when it happened yet again. Jen told me \u201cit\u2019s so hard as a mom. I have to keep explaining this to him and he\u2019s just so confused. I wish I had more time to ease him into this.\u201d\n\nI told her that I simply don\u2019t have sympathy for her. Yes, I acknowledge it\u2019s hard to be a parent and explain things in a child appropriate way\u2026but I\u2019m the wrong person to vent about this to. What would she like me to do? She understandably wants to handle it herself but I can\u2019t magically make my nephew understand, even if I did step in. I told her that it makes me feel like she\u2019s upset with me for \u201cexposing\u201d her son to this before she was ready.\n\nShe said this was an overreaction of my end but also refused to acknowledge the last part. I ended the conversation. Most of my family agrees with me but some say that I should just let Jen vent and that I need to be sympathetic. I just don\u2019t understand why she keeps coming to me and not vent to any of them?", "created_utc": 1680056413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125aa8c/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_dont_want_to_hear/", "score": 152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I was a kid there were two, TWO, lesbian couples on our street and honestly I didn\u2019t fucking realize it until I was like 14. One of them even had kids from donor sperm. Just never really thought about it. Because my mom treated them exactly like every other couple on the street. Never tried to explain it and I never cared enough to ask. I assumed they were just close lady friends who lived together and I thought it was cool that you could buy a house with your friends. Then one day I saw them out riding their bikes and it just clicked like \u201coooooOOOOOHHHhhh they\u2019re gay. Cool. \u201d That\u2019s it. Apparently other parents on the street were acting like your sister when the one couple got pregnant like \u201chow are we gonna explain this to our kids?\u201d (we were all probably <10 at the time) and my mom was just like do they even understand enough about how straight couples make babies to question it?

I knew plenty of gay people when I was Brent's age, and the way my parents explained it was that some people fall in love with men, some people fall in love with women, and it's all fine and natural.   \nIt wasn't some big revelation for me, it was just totally normal that anyone can fall in love with anyone.

How excited I was to eat waffles. It was breakfast time and the way syrup falls into the little waffle squares was all I could think about. \n\nNow I'm gay and have neices and I'm pretty sure they know but it's no big deal and not really a topic of conversation. They mostly want to talk to us about Harry Potter and whatever thing they most recently created. \n\nKids don't care.

I may have questioned more that my uncle wasn\u2019t married to my cousins mom anymore, but not that he had a bf. \n\nKids that age absorb how parents act and mimic them.

You can also love whoever makes your heart happy.\" If you can't enthusiastically say the second part, a 5 year old is going to catch you not being willing to accept them if they model Cousin Nick's behavior.", "She is missing step two of the process, she can identify OP's romantic partner as their person, but she isn't saying its okay.

She questioned it before, saying but they're both girls (or boys), and i said so? Conversation done lol. I was actually watching drag race earlier and we talked about what that is. She just thought it was really cool that they got to be queens lol.  This is the easiest age for explaining it in my opinion. She's not ready to know about the hate and struggles and all that. Just love is love, and everyone is unique in their own way.\n\nAll that to say NTA.

It's like in the same vein as explaining, \"some people have dark skin, some people have light skin, and some people are somewhere's in between.\" Reality reflects this, boom. Not complicated. \n\nHowever, for some reason it's too complex to say, \"some men prefer to have another man in their life like mommy and daddy are in eachothers lives, and some women prefer another woman the same way.\"\n\nHonestly, I get the feeling this isn't even Brendt's doing. He's 5, the above explanation I gave was the kind of foundational simplification you expect them to go, \"oh,\" and go about their day over. Your sister meanwhile may be beating the hell out of the subject because she herself doesn't grasp it. As an adult she probably suffers from a massive degree of projection, much as many do, and can't fathom that her experiences aren't completely universal. She's probably over complicating the simple fact that you like/love men in a way akin to her, and that you don't feel for women the same way she's experienced from men. Again, it's not at all complicated, but she's likely making it complicated for herself.\n\nNTA", "The best explanations come from kids.\n\nMy 6yr old's birthday party with the neighborhood kids. 7 yr old Joey asked my daughter \"why does your mom have a lady as the other person?\" he didn't have the words for partner or girlfriend.\n\nMy daughter explained in that authoritative certain way of children when they know things:\n\n\"Boys can love boys, and girls can love girls, they just can't make babies\"\n\nJoey gave that a thought, shrugged his shoulders and said \"OK\"\n\nI have no idea where my daughter came up with the explanation.

It's not the kid that's looking for an explanation, it's your sister who's struggling.", "NTA.  The explanation I used was to explain that it was like being right or left handed.  Some people are born one way or the other and some are even born both handed (I am amphitdextrous so this is helpful, I knit with both hands, write with my right and do things like throw pottery with my left).  Being left-handed isn't bad, just not right handed, and right handed is just fine too, just not left.  It is just the way they are. Now explain that who you like isn't tied to handedness so analogies don't get confused with facts.\n\n(Best part is that the handedness idea later explains bi and can explain antigay ideas as historical ideas on lefties.)", "NTA and I'm sorry, but I think your sister is exhibiting some kind of twisted thinking that if she keeps harping on how hard it is to explain your relationship to your nephew you'll give up on the relationship and suddenly decide to be straight.

Your sister is making it an issue/problem. \n\nMy 4yo understands just fine that \u201cpeople like who they like\u201d, and that \u201cuncle James has a boyfriend, just like auntie Ann has a girlfriend, and mommy has daddy\u201d.  \n\nI mean the questions have definitely exploded lately in general, and ofc always at bedtime, but never about that.

Or asking more questions? That onus is on me to explain and not complain about to my queer friends. (Mommy is bi.

My bf and I (M) met his cousin (6) for the first time recently and what she 'got' was that we were both family. She didn't ask or care about our relationship.

The sister sees it as a big thing, and the immediate \"ok\" from her kid makes her think he doesn't understand, rather than just being very accepting. He just wants to know if they can play MarioKart together. I'm guessing the sister has brought it up a few more times as an attempt to make him understand it from her point of view and degree of seriousness. He's 5, and he doesn't have any reason to care or contemplate what being gay means exactly.", "My buddy\u2019s 4-yo has a Daddy and a Papi. The kids at her school know she has a Daddy and a Papi and they know which is which. It is such a non-issue. Obviously the sister is the one that doesn\u2019t understand."]}
