They were all accepting, which is a huge relief. I\u2019ve been dating my boyfriend, Michael (28M) for about 2 years now, so he\u2019s been meeting the family.\n\nMy sister \u201cJen\u201d (35F) has a son, \u201cBrent\u201d (5M). When I first came out, Jen asked me how to explain it to him. She was genuinely (to me anyway) trying to be a good ally. Brent hasn\u2019t been exposed to anyone openly gay before (at least that my sister and her husband are aware of), so I understood it\u2019d be a learning curve. I recommended some books, offered to talk to Brent, etc. She took me up on the book recommendations and said she\u2019d talk to him.\n\nMichael came to a family party not long after and he met Brent. I thought it went well. Brent didn\u2019t ask any questions, outside if Michael would play Mario Kart with him. They did and I thought it was super adorable.\n\nShortly after, Jen kept coming to me saying that Brent didn\u2019t understand why his uncle is dating a man, but our brother is married to a woman. I told her to tell him everyone is different. He\u2019s  5. It\u2019s okay if he doesn\u2019t fully grasp it.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly gotten a little tiring hearing about it. Brent himself never seems confused when Michael and I are around. He loves playing with both of us. If he truly is consistently asking Jen about it, it\u2019s not showing. \n\nThe final straw for me was when it happened yet again. Jen told me \u201cit\u2019s so hard as a mom. I have to keep explaining this to him and he\u2019s just so confused. I wish I had more time to ease him into this.\u201d\n\nI told her that I simply don\u2019t have sympathy for her. Yes, I acknowledge it\u2019s hard to be a parent and explain things in a child appropriate way\u2026but I\u2019m the wrong person to vent about this to. What would she like me to do? She understandably wants to handle it herself but I can\u2019t magically make my nephew understand, even if I did step in. I told her that it makes me feel like she\u2019s upset with me for \u201cexposing\u201d her son to this before she was ready.\n\nShe said this was an overreaction of my end but also refused to acknowledge the last part. I ended the conversation. Most of my family agrees with me but some say that I should just let Jen vent and that I need to be sympathetic. I just don\u2019t understand why she keeps coming to me and not vent to any of them?", "created_utc": 1680056413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125aa8c/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_dont_want_to_hear/", "score": 2197, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I was a kid there were two, TWO, lesbian couples on our street and honestly I didn\u2019t fucking realize it until I was like 14. One of them even had kids from donor sperm. Just never really thought about it. Because my mom treated them exactly like every other couple on the street. Never tried to explain it and I never cared enough to ask. I assumed they were just close lady friends who lived together and I thought it was cool that you could buy a house with your friends. Then one day I saw them out riding their bikes and it just clicked like \u201coooooOOOOOHHHhhh they\u2019re gay. Cool. \u201d That\u2019s it. Apparently other parents on the street were acting like your sister when the one couple got pregnant like \u201chow are we gonna explain this to our kids?\u201d (we were all probably <10 at the time) and my mom was just like do they even understand enough about how straight couples make babies to question it?

I knew plenty of gay people when I was Brent's age, and the way my parents explained it was that some people fall in love with men, some people fall in love with women, and it's all fine and natural.   \nIt wasn't some big revelation for me, it was just totally normal that anyone can fall in love with anyone.

I may have questioned more that my uncle wasn\u2019t married to my cousins mom anymore, but not that he had a bf. \n\nKids that age absorb how parents act and mimic them.

You can also love whoever makes your heart happy.\" If you can't enthusiastically say the second part, a 5 year old is going to catch you not being willing to accept them if they model Cousin Nick's behavior.", "She is missing step two of the process, she can identify OP's romantic partner as their person, but she isn't saying its okay.

She questioned it before, saying but they're both girls (or boys), and i said so? Conversation done lol. I was actually watching drag race earlier and we talked about what that is. She just thought it was really cool that they got to be queens lol.  This is the easiest age for explaining it in my opinion. She's not ready to know about the hate and struggles and all that. Just love is love, and everyone is unique in their own way.\n\nAll that to say NTA.

It's like in the same vein as explaining, \"some people have dark skin, some people have light skin, and some people are somewhere's in between.\" Reality reflects this, boom. Not complicated. \n\nHowever, for some reason it's too complex to say, \"some men prefer to have another man in their life like mommy and daddy are in eachothers lives, and some women prefer another woman the same way.\"\n\nHonestly, I get the feeling this isn't even Brendt's doing. He's 5, the above explanation I gave was the kind of foundational simplification you expect them to go, \"oh,\" and go about their day over. Your sister meanwhile may be beating the hell out of the subject because she herself doesn't grasp it. As an adult she probably suffers from a massive degree of projection, much as many do, and can't fathom that her experiences aren't completely universal. She's probably over complicating the simple fact that you like/love men in a way akin to her, and that you don't feel for women the same way she's experienced from men. Again, it's not at all complicated, but she's likely making it complicated for herself.\n\nNTA", "The best explanations come from kids.\n\nMy 6yr old's birthday party with the neighborhood kids. 7 yr old Joey asked my daughter \"why does your mom have a lady as the other person?\" he didn't have the words for partner or girlfriend.\n\nMy daughter explained in that authoritative certain way of children when they know things:\n\n\"Boys can love boys, and girls can love girls, they just can't make babies\"\n\nJoey gave that a thought, shrugged his shoulders and said \"OK\"\n\nI have no idea where my daughter came up with the explanation.

It's not the kid that's looking for an explanation, it's your sister who's struggling.", "NTA.  The explanation I used was to explain that it was like being right or left handed.  Some people are born one way or the other and some are even born both handed (I am amphitdextrous so this is helpful, I knit with both hands, write with my right and do things like throw pottery with my left).  Being left-handed isn't bad, just not right handed, and right handed is just fine too, just not left.  It is just the way they are. Now explain that who you like isn't tied to handedness so analogies don't get confused with facts.\n\n(Best part is that the handedness idea later explains bi and can explain antigay ideas as historical ideas on lefties.)", "NTA and I'm sorry, but I think your sister is exhibiting some kind of twisted thinking that if she keeps harping on how hard it is to explain your relationship to your nephew you'll give up on the relationship and suddenly decide to be straight.

She wants to be supportive, but maybe she can't grasp it herself, somewhere subconsciously?", "NTA and your sister is either weird or homophobic.\n\nMy kiddo does not even have any LGBTQ family members, but I made it a point from the very beginning to teach him that love is love, sometimes boys love girls and sometimes they love boys or both. When we played Game of Life together, and he came on the field where he gets married, I always asked him if he wanted a blue or a pink figure for his car; I never assumed one over the other.

And I think that it is really important to have those conversations early on with kids to normalize that those things exist, no matter if you currently have LGBTQ family members or not.

When my little brother was 6 he watched a Disney tv show where one of the main characters was a kid being raised just by his mom (no dad was ever mentioned/showed up in the show). He was confused because he thought you had to be married to have kids. So I told him that kids came from a man and a woman having something called 'sex', and that a lot of the time a man and a woman will have sex because they want to be a mom and a dad, but that plenty of moms or dads might want to raise a kid on their own and will do that instead, and that sometimes two men or two women might adopt and raise a kid because they wanted to be moms or dads.\n\nHe just shrugged, said okay, and went on with his day. At 6 his day involved hunting for fossils outside, or sitting down in front of the tv to watch shows about the Jurassic/Triassic period and hold up his plastic dinosaurs to the screen and state their proper Latin names, when the equivalent dinosaur showed up on the screen. Most little kids don't really give a hoot about who the adults in their lives are dating as long as said significant others are nice, and will play with them.", "NTA. She\u2019s making drama out of nothing. The kid doesn\u2019t care. Parenting is difficult but telling a young kid that everyone is different is probably one of the easiest things I had to do.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that Jen does not find your relationship acceptable. She does not want her son to think that it is either. This is why Jen continues to have issues.", "NTA. So it's okay for her to share how she feels about the whole thing but when you express how you feel it's an overreaction? If she's struggling to explain two men together, I wish her luck explaining the more complicated things of life.", "My then 5 year old daughter came with me to pick out a dress to wear to a wedding and had a bunch of wedding questions. At the end she said \"I want to marry a girl. Can girls marry girls?\" I just said \"sure, as long as she's nice to you.\" And that was that. So now sometimes her pretend weddings have two brides, a bride and a groom or two grooms. Whatever she feels like at the time.", "Lol, my dad's was more along the lines of \"you know how you have a boyfriend? (I was maybe 6, but I informed everyone that my best friend was my forever boyfriend.) \"Some girls have boyfriends, some have girlfriends. Some boys have girlfriends, some have boyfriends. Sometimes it's forever, sometimes it's not.\" And that was that. It made perfect sense to me at the time.", "> why are the tough questions at bedtime?\n\nSo as not to have to go to sleep just yet. It's intentional, the diabolic little schemers.", "My mom's best friend is a lesbian, so it was always normal to me. I do remember learning that it was \"bad\" when I was like 8. I told my best friend I wanted to marry her so we could have play dates all the time.  Her mom never let me see her again. I had to ask my mom why she wasn't allowed to play with me anymore. She told me some people think same sex marriage is wrong.  I said \"that's stupid!\"", "I love when a little kid lets out a curse word, especially when it fits lol. I used to nanny for this one family and one day while we were getting out of the car a bee flew in as I was helping the little girl (she was 4) unbuckle. It came near her and she just yelled \u201cooooooooh fuuuuuuuuuck that\u201d and bolted out of the car. I remember talking to her about it later, how that was an adult word and she shouldn\u2019t use it yet. I told her she\u2019s not in trouble, props on using it in an appropriate situation, but that other parents won\u2019t want their kids to hear it and say it too so it\u2019s something she should wait until she\u2019s older to say. She didn\u2019t know any better, can\u2019t be upset about that, and honestly it was hilarious.", "I saw that one recently. It was good!\n\nIn the mid '80s I got \"married\" to my partner in a small ceremony in the woods by a creek. We had invited friends and one of my professors to the party after. I guess the prof had told her young daughter about it and later she told us she walked into her daughter's room to find her swinging her doll around, singing, \"She's going to marry a wooooomaaan!\" So cute."]}
