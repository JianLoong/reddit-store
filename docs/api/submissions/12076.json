We lost 2 pregnancies during that time, though we only told our families about the first. I\u2019m incredibly grateful to now be 13 weeks pregnant and have been looking forward to sharing that news with my family. \n\nOn Friday, we had dinner with my family - my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents - and we decided to share our news then. I decided to wait until dessert, so that we could leave shortly after telling everyone. Obviously, it\u2019s exciting news, but I was worried about all the emotions that could surface for myself and my husband.\n\nRight after we sat down to eat, my sister announced that she and her boyfriend are expecting their first child. I was thrilled for her and congratulated her, as did the rest of the family. Once things had settled down, I didn\u2019t want to waste the opportunity to have everyone together and thought it would be a good opportunity to keep the joy flowing, so I shared that I\u2019m pregnant as well.\n\nOur parents were so excited to be having two new grandbabies just a month apart and I was super happy that my kids would have a new cousin. My sister was happy for me but she left very soon after dinner and didn\u2019t stay for dessert.\n\nShe called me this afternoon and told me that as happy as she was for me, she felt that I\u2019d done a shitty thing by taking away \u201cher moment.\u201d She pointed out that this is my second baby and when I announced for the first time, I didn\u2019t have to \u201cshare\u201d with anyone. I didn\u2019t want to apologize because I didn\u2019t feel I\u2019d done anything wrong, but she finished out the phone call by saying that she didn\u2019t think I was really even happy for her, if I couldn\u2019t have let her have that moment and taken another for myself later on. That really stung.\n\nI truly didn\u2019t see it that way. I saw it as sharing joy, not stealing it. I also see each pregnancy as being unique, so I don\u2019t feel that it was right of her to say I shouldn\u2019t have said anything because it was my second baby. Honestly, I think she might be kind of hormonal. But I also want to understand my sister and I know I\u2019m not going to get anywhere asking her about it. So, I want to be enlightened. AITA for announcing my pregnancy immediately after my sister?\n\nETA: I\u2019m visiting from Los Angeles, my sister lives in New Jersey and our parents live in NYC.", "created_utc": 1678590812, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11p3oc5/aita_for_announcing_my_pregnancy_immediately/", "score": 8533, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You could have waited for a different day and I don\u2019t think it is bad that she wanted to be in the spotlight a little bit.

With that said disregarding her emotions as her just being hormonal is kinda mean.", "so OP, here's the real truth: it doesn't actually matter \"who's the asshole,\" because that's going to be an inherently subjective matter that depends on your personal views of how pregnancy announcements should go. what's important here is that your sister is upset, and you don't have to understand why. so swallow your pride and apologize to her.", "NAH. How often does your family get together for dinner or another event? You said you were out at dinner on a Friday so that means you are probably all local to each other. After your sister announced her pregnancy, you could have done the classy move of letting her have that night and just got the family together to tell them the following week or something. It\u2019s not \u201cwrong\u201d to announce the same night but it\u2019s not hard to see how she feels like her moment got overshadowed by you announcing at the same event.", "I'm going to go against most here to say NTA.\n\nI don't get a lot of the insanity regarding pregnancy announcements, the family was all together and you both had good news, especially you after having two miscarriages. Good grief, why do people get so weird when comes to these things?\n\nEven if you had waited to announce it the next day, she likely would have gotten her nose out of joint. I don't doubt that one bit. And the crack about you already having a kid...that shouldn't matter.\n\nLOL my mum got pregnant with me, her brother's wife and my dad's brother's wife all at the same time. Announcements came pretty much all at once (I was the first of the three to be born and I just asked mum about how she felt about all the announcements made together). Mum was over the moon for everyone and didn't care about having her moment, whatever that was supposed to mean, shared with her two sisters in law.\n\nI don't even find your comment about her being hormonal that bad. After her crack about you already having a kid, after you having at least one miscarriage she knew about was out of line. \n\nSo, nope, don't think you did anything wrong. Congrats on the new bambino/bambina and ignore sis. She was being ridiculous.", "NAH. Your sister has a right to her feelings and they're not unreasonable. But also, you had already planned to make this announcement, and you were traveling from across the country to do so. I assume you felt the need to go forward with your announcement because you wanted to do so in person and you don't always have that chance.", "Soft YTA. It definitely doesn\u2019t seem like you had ill intentions here, but you need to step back and walk in your sister\u2019s shoes. She\u2019s not wrong at all. It\u2019s NOT your first baby, but it is her first. You did steal the spotlight, even if inadvertently.

It is exciting that you're both pregnant at the same time. Your parents were probably overjoyed to hear the news. Maybe your sister is a little hormonal.

Second babies are not less important than first babies. You are going to be pregnant at the same time for the next several months. Your babies are going to be born close together. Is she going to expect you to take a back seat the entire time? Is she going to expect the family to give her child more attention than yours?

EVERY baby deserves to be celebrated but it sounds like you wanted to steal the spotlight from her.", "NTA. You\u2019re traveling and this may be the only chance you get to do it in person.

Is your sister going to blame you for stealing \"her moment\" every time you announce kids' milestones at the same time?  Because inevitably, they will develop at the same rate.  When does the madness end?

I do think you should apologize to your sister because I can see why she feels like you stole her spotlight but I also think the both of you were rude to each other, you reducing her very valid feelings down to hormones & her for insinuating your second pregnancy isn\u2019t as important as a first.", "Soft YTA, because you might not have bad intentions but you obviously upset your sister. \n\nTry to see where she's coming from. She announces her pregnancy and you announce yours right after, which makes it seem like you're trying to insert yourself in the conversation and make the moment about you. \n\nI can easily see how she took it the wrong way, and you should swallow your pride and apologize, because I'm sure there was a wealth of different times you could have announced your pregnancy.", "This greed for attention is getting way of hand. Your sister does not need or deserve an entire day of attention from everyone just because she managed to conceive a kid. Everyone is happy for her, that should be enough. Her jealousy of you also having a pregnancy to celebrate is childish, ridiculous, and narcissistic. You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA. Your sister is being ridiculous. You just have easily said she stole your plans for announcing.", "NTA. You had already planned to announce your pregnancy.  It\u2019s not your fault that she beat you to it.  There was no malicious intent here.  She is just as guilty for taking away your \u201cmoment\u201d.  Every pregnancy is unique, especially one with a long and painful path leading to it.  I am sure your sister was aware that you had been trying for a second child. One would think that she might have considered your feelings. It isn\u2019t a competition.", "YTA  By your own admission you wanted to 'keep the joy flowing' which means people were still celebrating your sister's news but you had to take the celebration away from your sister.

There's a big miscommunication that needs to be resolved.\n\nAlso, you should still apologize. Even though it wasn't your intention, your sister is upset and feels you took away her moment", "NTA.

Congratulations to you both.", "NAH", "NTA - since everyone lives so far a part and it sounds like y\u2019all don\u2019t get to see each other often.

You didn't intend to draw the focus away from her excitement and joy, but you did, due to timing. It split the family's focus and attention. No one got to stay savouring and reveling in the moment with her. The mindful and empathetic thing for you to have done would have been to just let the family focus on the joy and excitement of her pregnancy, and to hold off on your announcement. Your intention was honest but the effects of your actions didn't work out the way you anticipated. Next time don't rely on your intentions; consider more deeply how the others might be feeling.", "NTA. I can see you being slightly the AH if your sister was the one hosting and wanting to announce her pregnancy, but she wasn't the host. It was as you said, \"sharing the joy.\"", "YTA. Switch the roles and ask yourself if you'll be as chilled and calm as you're expecting her to be.

She's being absolutely reasonable.", "YTA. You should have waited for another time. You made her pregnancy announcement about you, when it should have been about her. I get that you were happy and wanted to share the joy, but most people would not be happy about sharing the limelight. My SIL was pregnant with her second baby at the same time as I was with my first, and I was not happy about it. If she had announced her pregnancy when I announced mine, we wouldn\u2019t have any relationship now. I think you were worried no one would be as excited about your second, so you hijacked your sister\u2019s big moment. Had you waited a week, no big deal, people still would have been happy. You should just apologize if it\u2019s not the hill you want to die on.", "Nah.

I don't see it myself, but emotional stuff is fairly often not amenable to any sort of logic.  at least tell her you never meant it that way, and you are happy for her and her bf.  can't hurt, might help.  and you do have my sympathy for your previous losses, so many people think nothing of it.  you meant well, though, so in my book, you are NTA!", "NTA your sister is wrong, but her childishness will punish her all her life.

That is a big announcement and moment. She deserved the spotlight for a bit. There is absolutely no reason you couldn\u2019t have done it at a later date or even over the phone another day. It\u2019s your second baby, you had your moment. So selfish.", "I'd say YTA.  You didn't tell anyone you had something to share over food.

Why couldnt she have one night about her first child?? \nI told my parents over the phone.

Sometimes people want to have their own special moments and bask in the happiness of their own milestones and important events, and they want their family and loved ones to appreciate those with them - without getting it 'undermined' by someone else's moment or having to have to share it. It's not self centered, it's human nature to want to feel important esp for something big like this, and a first baby is big. Your family's attention turned from her and her baby to both of you and made comments about how her baby is your baby's cousin instead of just being its own thing.

Is it that much of a issue to give them that space? \n\nThere\u2019s absolutely cases where people go overboard and take their need for the limelight too far, but a common refrain I see in these kinds of posts is \u201cugh, how shallow, can\u2019t we just SPREAD THE LOVE???\u201d which, you know, that\u2019s your attitude, but that\u2019s most probably going to lead to pissed off loved ones who feel like you\u2019re ignoring their emotional needs and denying them a special moment they may have dreamt of for a long time. It costs 0 dollars to uplift the people in your life by letting them have their shine for this one night/event, and then letting them uplift you next time when it\u2019s your turn to take center stage. if you don\u2019t care about that, ok, but some people really do, and it\u2019s genuinely not a big ask.", "I don\u2019t think the sister is angry just upset which I think she is justified.

Why do you consider one an engagement onto another's wedding?", "YTA still you could have done it the next day.", "Who planned the meal out, was it you with the intention of telling people your news? If so you're not the AH. If it was your sister, then YTA as after she announced her news then it should have been obvious that she planned the meal to reveal and celebrate her news and as you were spending the whole weekend with your family, you could have then suggested going out the next day for brunch and revealed your news then.", "Agree! Plus with sister being much closer to the parents she is even more likely to be fussed over than OP. \n\nOP could theoretically get pissed at her sister that she stole HER moment since OP traveled all the way there planning to share the news.

It\u2019s her sisters first baby and she couldn\u2019t let her have that moment. She always had her moment when it was the first child.", "Don't you know if someone doesn't get enough attention they will literally die. If you are at a wedding don't let anyone see your baby lest you steal attention from the bride. If someone says they're pregnant first you have to shut up and hide your pregnancy and put the kid up for adoption. \n\nNEVER STEAL SOMEONE'S ATTENTION. They will wither away to a wisp of smoke on the spot if you do.", "You had me until the last sentence.", "I agree she shouldn\u2019t have dismissed her feelings but you need to take inconsideration that she was already planning on telling her family the news so the only asshole thing she did was dismiss her sisters feelings", "If sister does not normally act entitled like this, then \"pregnancy hormones\" is a reasonable hypothesis.", "She\u2019s probably expected to wait until the next big family gathering in a few years. Sister can\u2019t complain about having the spotlight stolen from her then!", "Why can't two people be in the spotlight? Does everything have to be a solo? Can there be no duets?", "I somehow doubt the sister would have been less offended if she had waited till dessert to share the baby news.

I think the intention was good but I agree that it probably would\u2019ve been best to wait or at least privately ask the sister how she felt about it.

Some acts are just a solo and that\u2019s ok. Not every single last thing in life is meant to be shared.", "I agree, they live in different places and they both took the time to share the news.

It\u2019s a lovely sentiment, but unfortunately it wasn\u2019t a shared one. But instead of trying to give her sister some grace when sis told her she felt like she\u2019d been denied a special moment, OP decided her sister\u2019s emotions aren\u2019t valid, she\u2019s got nothing to apologize for and sis is just acting like a hormonal pregnant lady aka is being irrational when clearly, going by the responses in this post, a lot of people here agreed with her.

The videos where people get shown a pregnancy announcement and then share their own are beautiful, as it's the same thought process, they're sharing the love, they're happy for each other and themselves.

I'm wondering if your grandma's family was from a country along the Mediterranean Sea! Seems to be a thing in my mom's side of the family. You tick off one of the older members, and you are gonna get size 7 upside your head. \n\nMy mom has 2 sisters  and 2 brothers (the oldest 3 are 11 and 8.5 months apart). Within 9 months, my mom, my oldest aunt, my oldest uncle, AND my mom's step mom all had babies. That was just her immediate family. My mom's side is huge, and they were all close when my generation grew up. There was close to a dozen of us born that yr if I include all my mom's cousins kids. That cycle repeated itself every few yrs for my generation. And it happened again when my generation had kids. My grandparents have had years when they had to go to 4 graduation parties for their great grandkids. It's just a running joke now as far as announcements. We just talk amongst each other to make sure weddings and parties aren't on the same day. I guess growing up in such a big family, we never really got \"territorial\" as far as announcements and stuff go. It was kind of expected that someone else was going to have the same news as yourself.\n\nI would have to say ESH (just a little bit). Sister should consider that OP flew all the way across the country to see family and announce her news, and be excited that her child is going to have a cousin the same age. OP should have been more considerate of her sister's feelings and apologized for the hurt feelings and explained to her why it was important to announce her pregnancy that day. OP shouldn't have dismissed her sister's feelings. They both need to move on from it after they both apologize to each other and focus on the fact that their babies may grow up close due to their age, even if they do live across the country. Some of my best memories growing up were with my cousins (no matter how far away they lived) that were the same age as me. It was like having your own \"crew\" to support you, have your back, encourage you, and have fun with.\n\nEdit: Just to be clear, I do not think OP is esh for announcing the pregnancy. It was planned, she was from out of town and all the people she cared about were there to hear the news. I think that OP could have done better to not dismiss her sister's feelings. Frankly, if I lived away from most of my family and flew in to see them and announce my pregnancy (no more for me thankfully!), I still would have announced it at dinner, too. FaceTime is great, but it's not the same as in person, I think the majority of us discovered that fun fact during lockdowns.", "I had mentioned that in another comment as well!

But if she genuinely wanted to add to the joy then by that logic she may have been perfectly okay with that if that had been what happened.\n\nETA: op has PLANNED to announce but sister beat her to it. That should NOT derail her plans. And let\u2019s say she did wait til after dessert or the next day; sister would still have had an issue EVEN THOUGH sister lives CLOSER to the family and would definitely be getting more attention than OP who lives states away and wanted to be able to share the joy in person which is obviously why she PLANNED it for when she did.", "Your acting like conceiving is an easy thing and not something many, like OP, struggle with.

I think basking is allowed in that event.", "I agree with the term and it\u2019s usage for couples who have been trying for so long.  Some throw the term around like a scarf.  I feel for those who have a truly hard time conceiving and they\u2019re miracle/rainbow babies should be celebrated.  It just seems that OP wanted to steal her sisters thunder.  In the same vein I can see her using the term to get more attention on herself and continuing to steal her sisters glow.", "Only the parent comment matters; you can write whatever in response to one of them and it won't affect anything.", "The point of this is if OPs is an asshole or not, not if she can legally/physically do something.  General consensus is you usually don\u2019t overshadow people during big announcements or weddings it\u2019s rude.  As such the timing here matters.  While I personally hunk she should\u2019ve had another family dinner the next day, I could understand the arguments if they waited an hour or so.  But literally doing it right after gets into asshole territory.\n\nSo yeah the timing matters here.", "I get the feeling behind \"I don't have to apologize if I didn't do anything objectively wrong\" sentiment, but at the same time, I question whether it's a good idea in the real world. To me, some apologies are admissions of guilt, and some apologies are just acknowledging that your actions had unintended effects on people, whether you could have known that they would or not.\n\nI learned this lesson when, in elementary school, I apologized to a classmate for mentioning ghosts. The discussion of ghosts and death hurt her because her sister had recently passed away (like within the past week). It wasn't wrong of me to talk about ghosts, but it hurt her regardless, and so I apologized. Sometimes, an apology can just mean \"I didn't mean to hurt you, and it matters to me that I did.\"\n\nThat's why I think OP should apologize. She doesn't have to say that she was objectively wrong, just that she cares about her sister's feelings and that, if she had known her actions would have hurt her sister, she would have tried to avoid or mitigate that hurt.", "Lmao I think the sister would have been even more upset if OP managed to announce it first.", "OP was already planning to announce before the sister did", "FACTS!", "Right!", "I disagree wholeheartedly.

This was back in the early 50s, when they kept women in the hospital for a week or 2 after childbirth. We laughed a lot over the years about that and my brother and cousin were always close friends.", "This. I\u2019d be so excited that it was at the same time. \n\nAlso the sister might as well rip off the bandaid now..  it\u2019s not about you anymore. Ever again.", "My sister knew she was pregnant at my college graduation. Everyone was there. It would have been a great time for her to share her news. But she didn't and I was really grateful, especially since I knew (and she knew) even at that age I couldn't have kids.\n\nShe announced a few weeks later.\n\nI still think this is different though. The day wasn't set up for OPs sister. It was the same news - it wasn't like the sister said they were having a baby and OP tried to trump it by saying she was getting married or killed the mood by saying they were getting divorced.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m white af and the term la chancla! resonates with me so much! Growing up if my sister or I got in trouble grandma\u2019s house slipper came off so fricken fast. Luckily, we weren\u2019t smacked with it ever, but damn it made us straighten up and act right. WAY more than mom or dads belt ever did.", "Thwocka wocka!\n\nNTA, btw", "The way I cackled when I read this \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1s\u00ed!!!!", "That whole family sounds like a mess", "Okay but are people really like \u201cI just liked a baby, that other baby from 5 minutes ago is old news!\u201d I don\u2019t see how they diminish each other.", "This attitude predates the internet at all", "OP said she would have been happy and that pregnancy announcements are to share the joy, so I assume she would be unbothered.", "Ah.  Well, I\u2019m certainly not perfect, nor are all the important people in my life. Agree no room for perpetually dramatic, selfish individuals.  However, we all have our moments and my point of view definitely is not always correct.  Acknowledging feelings and trying to move forward seems to minimize future issues too!", "This.  It\u2019s just about wanting attention.  I think the sister would be pissed no matter what.  It\u2019s sad that the sister couldn\u2019t be happy that they will be having cousins extremely close in age.", "This should 100% be the top comment. This attention-seeking baby announcement thing sounds competitive and immature. More joy should make everyone happy! \n\nNTA OP", "Ahhh ok thanks for explaining to me, that makes sense. Yeah I still wouldn\u2019t be bothered but yeah different things bother different people haha", "That is my thought too. Sister is still going to have the family making a big fuss at all her baby related events and will likely have Mom around to go shopping with her, et.\n\nSis on the west coast? Not so much. With the cost of airfare her only moments with the family will likely be the announcement and maybe the birth if Mom and Dad come out then or right afterwards.", "100% this.\n\nIf I flew from the west coast to the east coast (or vice versa) at the cost of about $900/ticket right now (so for a family of 3 like OPs, $1800), you bet I'm not going to miss a single opportunity to have the important conversations and memories with distant family.\n\nSorry if Sister is angry but she can deal with it. She lives at most a couple of hours and a take of gas from her parents. she can see them and most of the family anytime and will be lavished with attention most of the pregnancy. Sis will have baby showers, and likely have Mom and Dad's support during the pregnancy.\n\nOP, she gets this moment and then likely someone will come out at the end of the pregnancy to help with child #1. That's it. Given how fleeting life is, you take EVERY moment you can to create special memories with family and one of those memories is the look on faces when you tell people you are pregnant. But that look doesn't change if you are the first or second person to announce. \n\nOP, you likely just gave more to talk about at dinner. As opposed to it simply being \"when are you due?\" \"How are you feeling?\" \"Congratuations\" Suddenly its also \"Oh my goodness! How far apart will the cousins be!?!\" And all sorts of things along those lines.", "My sister told multiple people about her engagement at my wedding. She got engaged two months after me to a guy she had just met while she was in Korea, so when she came home for my wedding it was the first time she had seen lots of family in almost a year. Anyone who wasn\u2019t friends with her on Facebook didn\u2019t know yet. I still didn\u2019t care. I was happy for her and it literally didn\u2019t take away from my day at all.", "some people are too self absorbed.", "ya don't know what your talking about my brother spent 60,000.00 in the 80's so do the inflation math lol", "I never understood the need to be in a spotlight, myself.  I'm not a shrinking wallflower, but I didn't need to be the big star of the show either.  I wonder how much of it is social media ... they're doing more, now, because they can put up posts of such happy stuff, and get an attention feeding from that too.", "I honestly think that my mom was disappointed I didn't make a bigger deal of my milestones. No graduation party, both baby announcements were just random conversation (the first was a little traumatic, but that's a whole story), no gender reveals, lackluster baby shower, no wedding events except the actual wedding, and that was tiny and in my backyard. Honestly was how I preferred it, being the center of the spotlight is the worst.", "I am so glad to see this sentiment in this thread. I feel crazy pants most of the time because all of this \"special day\" and having their \"moment\" stuff just seems selfish to me. I am pregnant myself at this time with my third. There was no special announcement with any of my three kids. I literally just told my family, and I personally wouldn't have cared if anyone else said they were pregnant too. Someone else being pregnant doesn't detract, actually I'd be excited to have a close family member having a kid that would be the same age as mine. Images of play dates dancong in my head and all that. Then I'd probably talk about baby stuff. I say this because my niece is ttc and that's what we do all the time.  Announcing via microphone at a wedding is tacky, but mentioning it without making a big deal isn't a AH move.  Why is there this idea we can only celebrate one thing at a time. Joy and love are not a pie.  I do not get less because you got some too.", "Everyone wants to be special. The more we eliminate old traditions of celebrating life milestones, and the more we withdraw from various community organizations, the fewer opportunities there are for people to feel special. I think that is why people get so bent out of shape about their special moments being exclusive. We feel like we won\u2019t have many opportunities to be validated.", "I can\u2019t tell, are you being sarcastic?", "NAH, but dismissing your sister's feelings calling her \"hormonal\" made it a close call.", "YTA, look i have been in her position twice and for once i am the only one in 2 different families pregnant. My first pregnancy, my sister found out she was pregnant 2 weeks after me with her 4th child. Just a few months later, my SIL gets pregnant for the 2nd time. For my second pregnancy, my other SIL is also pregnant, and we have the same due date now its a competition on who is bigger, what sex, who will come first. It sucks. For my third and final and due any day now. Got through a pregnancy without anyone else getting pregnant and people just happy for me because this is our last.", "YTA \n\nYou needed to shelve yours. This is her first pregnancy, and you both deserved your own announcements. \n\nYou effectively transferred the excitement to you at a time that she deserved to revel in the family\u2019s excitement and love. \n\nEven a day\u2019s difference would have been better.\n\nI have a hard time believing this was truly the only time you could share. You waited til the last dinner?", "Yta. It's exactly like she said, \nIt's the same when people propose at a wedding. It takes the attention away from the first one. \nThe fact you can't see it or even wanted to wait shows you feel it's about you.\nThe 'i think she may be hormonal' comment is extremely patronising. I don't blame her for being mad", "YTA\n\nI would have started with ESH but you dismissing her feelings because \"shes hormonal\" is very petty. You got the same thing going and its shunned if a man says it.\n\nWe all perceive these celebration differently. For my brother's wife, she didnt want a baby shower because she thought it was stupid and for my wife, we couldnt have one because of COVID and she cried like alot, felt like a special moment was robbed from her.\n\nYou cant judge how it impact your sister because you dont necessarily value these things the same.\n\nIts like if someone pop the question and right after they are done you turn around and pop the question also, it cast shadow on the first one, steal their thunder.\n\nYou got 9 months to find another date to announce it, i know you didnt want to be a dick, you thought it was harmless and just more joy to add but you wrongly read how others would react.\n\nGo and apologize, keeping in good term with family is more important then your ego", "NAH because you already had planned to announce your pregnancy. You flew across the country and had already in mind to announce it. Your sister beat you to it and I don't think it's appropriate for her to expect to drop everything that you planned. I would explain exactly that to her. You would-be the arsehole if she announced it and you just went along with it. But you already had planned to do it beforehand. \n\nBut I do understand that she feels like you stole her moment. I think even if you waited for dessert she would still have a moment for herself. Not so long but she would have her moment for herself. She was nice but left. She didn't do any drama and wrote to you her feelings after she cooled of a bit. So she's also not the arsehole.\n\nI don't know your family dynamics. But for me, no one is an arsehole here because from a neutral perspective, I understand both reactions.", "It doesn\u2019t matter what a bunch of internet strangers think. You hurt your sister\u2019s feelings, she\u2019s upset. Why don\u2019t you just talk to your sister and make things right between the two of you? Literally who cares if random strangers say you\u2019re not the AH in the grand scheme of things? Your sister thinks you\u2019re the AH and you hurt her feelings - that\u2019s the only opinion that should matter to you.", "My take on sisters mindset:  Perhaps it\u2019s not the sharing of the news in and of itself, but the resulting conversion from the news.  All the q&a that likely occurs.  I\u2019m pretty sure a baby isn\u2019t announced and then the topic goes back to the latest episode of The Voice.\nSo, technically that\u2019s what your sister feels she missed out on.  That one-on-one specifically about her baby.\n\nYes, it is a selfish mindset, but it\u2019s also very human to want to bring everyone in on YOUR excitement.  Now her excitement has been watered down to include your excitement.  \n\nYou\u2019re obviously of two different streams of thought in this situation, which implies a stark personality difference.  Have you seen this type of reaction from your sister before?  Could you have predicted her reaction?", "'Honestly, I think she might be kind of hormonal' nice internalised misogyny there with a big dose of hypocrite\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust apologise\n\nYTA", "YTA... you invalidated your sister's feeling as being \"hormonal\" and I'm guessing this is nothing new.", "I think you\u2019re both TA\u2026\u2026. \n\nI find the whole concept of ruining someone\u2019s moment mind boggling. Sure a wedding don\u2019t announce a pregnancy or engagement. But a family dinner where you all aren\u2019t usually together is an appropriate opportunity for you to both share. YTA for blaming her hormones instead of respecting and even trying to understand how she was feeling\u2026.. she\u2019s TA because the \u201cmoment\u201d is when the baby gets here\u2026.. you can both be pregnant and happy", "Ok, first of all it\u2019s her boyfriend, not her husband and we need to quit treating an out of wedlock baby like it\u2019s a great thing. It\u2019s not and it doesn\u2019t show a commitment to the relationship, but a \u201cdamn we forgot the condom\u201d, so screw her. The same thing happened to me 3 weeks after I announced my pregnancy, my brother\u2019s girlfriend. I never voiced my Opinion but I was pissed. If the relationship is important to bring a child,, then what was wrong with a marriage license. I love my niece, but I was disappointed in my brother, we weren\u2019t raised this way to think an illegitimate child was okay. \n\nI know I will get grief for this, but it\u2019s how I feel. If your sister had announced she was getting married and you announced your were pregnant, you still wouldn\u2019t be the asshole.", "NTA, you were visiting from across the country and get few chances to tell everyone in person. Also nobody gets to claim the spotlight on something like this. It doesn\u2019t matter who announced first, or that this is her first and your second. Your sister is being selfish and should apologize for making your shared joy less bright because of her own ego.", "NTA but I honestly want to know what would have happened if the tables were turned and OP had gotten her announcement out first at dinner. Would the sister have sat back and let OP \u201chave the attention\u201d for the remainder of the night, or would she have piggybacked onto the good news like OP did? Or would she have said nothing but then lashed out later because she didn\u2019t get \u201cher night\u201d and \u201cher news\u201d? And how many days would OP have had to wait to make the announcement so that sister would not have viewed it as stealing the spotlight? 1 days? 2 days? A week? A month? These \u201cwhat if?\u201d scenarios may be irrelevant, but I honestly get the sense that sister would have been upset no matter how things went down.", "Gotta go with YTA cause you could easily have waited a few days before telling your parents. My husband's brother and his wife waited an extra week to announce their second child was on the way because we announced we were engaged. They gave us that moment.", "YTA. Very selfish. I agree with your sister. This is her first baby, she shouldn\u2019t have to split the joy with you. \n\nYou should\u2019ve waited.", "I agree. I also have some issues with the sister\u2018s reaction. \n\nSure, it\u2019s possible she\u2019s just disappointed that she didn\u2019t get as much attention as she thought, but her behaviour is\u2026 odd\u2026 \n\nAdmittedly, I came after the edit so that might influence it, but I gotta wonder what the occasion for this family meal was. Was it maybe for OP, who visited literally from across the country? Does sis maybe think op stole her moment, cause she\u2019s projecting since that\u2019s what she wanted to do at a dinner hosted for op? \n\nCause since op, too saw this dinner as the right occasion to announce her pregnancy, even before her sister\u2019s announcement, it had to be a special occasion. \n\nIn any case, even if sis is just genuinely disappointed, op has to return home at some point and you can\u2019t keep a pregnancy secret forever anyways, so she had to announce it during her trip. Which would mean, it\u2019s still not too long after her sister\u2019s announcement. So yeah.. I also think op is NTA and if sis is genuine, then it\u2019s N A H", "Disagree. You don't just blanket apologise to every person that's upset with you, ever. \n\nHave some self respect", "This is the best answer I've seen on AITA in a long ass time. It doesn't matter who's right or who's wrong... your sister's hurt. Maybe irrationally, but... she's your sister. Tell her you're sorry, you just were so excited about you two having kids so close in age, and then redirect the focus onto how excited you are for her to become a mother. I've got multiple kids and it's true that the first one is just a little more exciting. All kids are loved equally, but the first time is just so much more heightened because you've never done it before. Your sister's brand new to this, she's probably terrified/scared/excited/elated all at once and indulge her in those feelings a little.\n\nAnd congrats on your rainbow baby. Those, like a first pregnancy, also come with their own set of unique emotions, joys, and fear.", "I'm upset that you think this way, where's My apology?", "I was hoping for the answer in your comment. I answered NTA but I have no idea what the etiquette is for this situation, plus she lives across the country and doesn't have many opportunities for an in-person announcement. Sometimes people just get their feelings hurt, intent has nothing to do with it.", "> This greed for attention is getting way of hand.\n\nTo an extent, I get it when it comes to weddings. If the bride and groom (or their parents) pay for a big party, I think it's pretty tacky for someone else to swan in and try to make the party about them.\n\nBut for everything else (including this case with a baby announcement), I totally agree with you. Life happens. And it's not always nicely spaced out, so that everyone gets to have their \"moment\".\n\nAnd on top of that, OP flew in for this announcement whereas the sister lives in easy driving distance.", "I was just thinking this. I haven't got kids yet but my partner and I are trying. My brother and SIL have a 5 year old boy. If I announced I was pregnant at a dinner with them and my parents and she happened to as well, I'd be excited to be pregnant alongside her! I couldn't imagine calling later to be salty at her \ud83d\ude15", "Yea this is definitely a thing that weirds me out when people get upset about being pregnant at the same time as someone else. Like, you don't want kids the same age? They could have playdates together? Be more relatable to each other? You don't want any of that??\n\n\nAll of my siblings are thrilled to have their kids in similar age groups because the cousins understand each other so well. You just don't get the same level of connection otherwise.", "I disagree. It wasn't a formal individual celebration, such as a birthday or a wedding. Every pregnancy and baby is something to be excited about, and it's not as if they discussed it prior. Had the sister told OP about her big announcement and knew she wanted it to be her \"big\" moment that would be different. \n\nI agree with OP. It sounds like the sister is hormonal, but there's no reason she should have felt the need to have all of the joy on her. OP was already planning to share her own news, so too bad. Her sister should be happy they will experience this together. \n\nI almost guarantee her sister is the baby of the family, is spoiled, and just used to her \"moments\".", "Or pulled her sister aside and say, \u201cI\u2019m pregnant, too! And I was just about to announce\u2026\u201d That would have given sis a minute to have emotions without people watching, and might have given her the time to relax about it and be happy for OP.", "People are so self centered it\u2019s insane to me.", "Same! I read things like this in disbelief that anyone thinks sharing news of a pregnancy is an event, and therefore can be \"stolen\" and shouldn't be \"shared\". I honestly think these things have become events so that they can be worthy of posting on social media and/or buying things related to them. Anything can be marketed now, and suddenly an event is born.", "Yes, this! I don't get why announcements has to be given spotlight. 'I need to have my moment'. Wth. Pregnancy, wedding, etc are all good news to be shared. Doesn't matter who did it first.", "Same, it\u2019s so dumb.", "My family is the same. Sharing pregnancy announcements was brief, there was a hug, then we continued our day. \n\nI do see the emotional jolt of having your moment interrupted. It's like someone hijacking a conversation when you weren't done speaking. That's a violation of the rule we learned as kids of \"wait your turn\". \n\nIn this case, it sounds like everyone traveled for the meetup so sharing the pregnancy at the same meetup was proper, but waiting until the end of the meal as planned would have worked out better.", "Yeah. \"Poor\" sister. Imagine having to share her first pregnancy with someone else. Boo hoo. I announced my 1st pregnancy. Then my sister announced her 2nd. My aunt her 4th. My cousin her first. And finally, my other sister her fist. Yes, we all had babies born months a part in the same year. It's so cool having them all grow up together. It reminded me of my cousins and  us growing up. \nAlthough for my 2nd one, my sister announced it on social media before I even had a chance to tell people. That bothered me. I told her it was uncool and she apologized. I got over it because you know, I was having a baby.", "lol I'd be even more upset if that's someone came back at me with. That's condescending as shit.", "Apologizing would just be setting the sister up to be upset at every milestone OP shares with her upcoming kid because \"she already had a kid.\" I don't understand why the sister feels it needs to be a competition rather than just be happy they will have children of similar age.", "While my engagement with this subreddit is mostly an exercise in self-harm, I do think there are situations where assigning blame is important. This just isn't one of them.", "I agree with this. Why is the sisters immediate reaction to be angry and hurt instead of happy and like \u201cyay twinsies!\u201d", "Your approach is completely valid, but it doesn\u2019t invalidate OP\u2019s sister\u2019s desire for her pregnancy announcement to go a certain way. It is completely normal to want to feel special. Of course, OP\u2019s sis needs to process these emotions and not blame OP for her disappointment. She is hurling accusations, which feels more cathartic, in lieu of sitting with those uncomfortable feelings of disappointment.", "Well unfortunately this story isn\u2019t about you", "I took that as she was excusing sister\u2019s poor behavior.", "This too!! I would\u2019ve felt really sad that we didn\u2019t get to celebrate together if my sister called me later to avoid \u201cstealing my spotlight\u201d.", "It's certainly not all Americans. I was super stoked when my bro told us they were having a baby when they came to visit for our wedding. I cannot imagine a scenario where I wouldn't be excited to hear about a new family member coming into the world. Especially from someone as close to me as my siblings.\n\nThe whole \"spotlight\" shit is incredibly weird to me. Especially when considering the context of an intimate dinner with immediate family. You have known these people your entire life. You have shared the best moments, the worst moments, and everything in between. The sister has had her spotlight a million times from every milestone. There shouldn't be some arbitrary cooling-off period for happy announcements in a normal family.  The sister is 1000% TA in this situation. How she could not be happy for her sibling in this situation baffles me and honestly, it sounds like she has some unresolved shit to work through.", "Not most Americans. Just some coddled entitled ones.", "Of course not. You just think for someone you care about you would at least let them know so they aren\u2019t blindsided and have some time to prepare mentally. It\u2019s not like OP and her SO had a meltdown or anything like that. It\u2019s just comes across like the sister hasn\u2019t considered how OP might feel at all. Also, they both had the same plan, and obviously it was fine. Idk, my sisters and I tell each other everything. We found out we were pregnant a couple weeks from each other. I was the first one she told and vise versa. I did end up miscarrying, and my sister always gave me the option to opt out of things like the gender reveal and baby shower, especially because they were things we originally planned to have joined. Sorry this is way too long.", "I'm also very weirded out by this strange mentality of having \"my moment\". Just the way it's phrased sounds very very self-centered and selfish. Honestly, whenever I read something like this I just check the post and the comments and laugh and I'm thankful that I don't have anyone like that in my life, it sounds exhausting.", "Exactly this. I really don't understand the advice of apologising. It will simply give the sister all rhyme and reason to act up and expect a passive response in the future.", "I was pregnant with my sister. Didn\u2019t enjoy that at all tbh. There were no fun stories. I didn\u2019t hate it but it wasn\u2019t fun. Two hormonal sisters, one of them being extra high risk (not me).

I think that's the difference -- close sisters vs. not-so-close.", "It sure has, but it\u2019s gotten exponentially worse because of how people combine it with social media.", "Exactly--it's a very human desire to want to feel special here and there, and assuming OP's sister hasn't tried to minimize any of OP's large moments in the past I don't think we can automatically write her off as shallow. \n\nI don't think I have enough info to make a judgement (plus as the current top comment says, this is more about the sisters' relationship than aita). \n\nI will say that I've witnessed this exact \"why can't we share vs why did they steal my moment\" thing come up a few times with people in my circle who have adult siblings...and it's almost never about a single \"spotlight.\" The actual source of angst is usually deeper and a reflection of something that's been going on in the family dynamic for a while. Iranian yogurt and all that.", "This is exactly what I wanted to express. There are few huge moments in life to celebrate big announcements. Pregnancy, engagements, big promotions. They don\u2019t happen often and some people really look forward to that moment of feeling special for a day. That may not be your inclinations and that\u2019s ok. Some people don\u2019t enjoy the spotlight. Some don\u2019t see these announcements as a big deal. But some people really long for these special days to bask in the positive attention. It doesn\u2019t make them bad or selfish people. If she was going mom-zilla and dictating how everyone else makes their announcements after this, then it\u2019s getting into selfish territory and you need to check yourself. But looking for a single day, or even a single meal to be able to bask in the positive attention of this special moment for yourself doesn\u2019t make you unreasonable.", "Yeah, I imagine it would make me a bit sad.

She\u2019ll live and she\u2019ll get past this first world problem that she\u2019s created \n\nCongratulations on your new little one!! Sending you love and positive energy.", "Absolutely cannot stand the immature attention whoring by people these days. It\u2019s pathetic and ugly.", "100% having a baby is not about getting attention or having a moment, it's about a new life brought into the family. \n\nThe idea of two new lives and two babies who will have the opportunity to share a family and stages of life is so beautiful and exciting. If that had been me and my siblings it would have quadrupled my excitement. \n\nExpecting your also pregnant sibling to continue to hide their pregnancy so you can get more *attention* is the height of childishness.", "So OP is 12/13 weeks\u2026. \nSister might be a month behind her or a month a head of her\u2026 she didn\u2019t say who is due first\u2026 \n\nBut OP is in town for the weekend, parents are probably paying attention to her. & her current child. \nAnnounces pregnancy.. to get some do icus back on her \nSister announces pregnancy \n\n*Pikachu face* \n\nSister states attention was stolen from her\u2026 \n\nNTA.", "op has the same hormones going on rn too, which is why she knows that her sister might be hormonal lol. she\u2019s speaking from experience", "She was hormonal and selfish. There are no backseats to pregnancies. Sorry", "I mean she planned to tell them already. She wasn\u2019t stealing her thunder. It isn\u2019t her fault her sister also was pregnant and announced hers first. Her sister is TA for making a big deal out of nothing. Especially since she lives MUCH closer than OP! OP is NTA!!", "I disagree. It is not like she made a spontanuosely thing out of it like: oh well she is pregnant then i can tell it now instead of later. No. She flew across the country and planned to tell then. \n\nAlso yes it is her sisters first pregnancy but she is (safely) pregnant after two losses, which is a huge thing (i lost two children as well and afterwards the pregnancy was a huge thing for me too!) \n\nAlso does her sister not have the prime on pregnancy. What will she do when both babies arrive at the same date (which is possible if one overtakes two weeks and the otherone comes two weeks early?! Had it with a friend actually!) does she say then, that she stole the birthday? \n\nEveryone should just grow up here and take it as something as it is: something special for everyone!", "Hard disagree. She planned that dinner explicitly to tell her parents. If anything, her sister stole her moment. Her sister couldn't have known though so NAH.", "Absolutely agreed. I am on my 4th pregnancy, and the only one to make it out of the first trimester. We waited to announce to family until we'd gotten a good scan with a strong heartbeat, and even then it was difficult. Waited til 20 weeks to announce publicly, and still worried it was too early. \n\nJust entered the third trimester, and I feel more reassurance with every kick. \n\nPregnancy after loss is so hard, and sister just made it harder. \n\nOP is NTA", "My favorite retort to \"the squeaky wheel gets the grease\": the squeaky wheel gets removed.", "There was no squeaky wheel. Sister congratulated her, and did not make a scene.  She left quietly when an opportunity came to not bring the dinner down.  She then brought up her hurt with OP in a private conversation.  I would have gone N  A  H  until OP added that sister doesn't have a right to her feelings.  OPs lack of empathy pushes me towards YTA.", "The sister is a squeaky wheel because she threw a tantrum at OP, even in private.", ">I'm sorry I caused you to feel less important for your big announcement by sharing my own news\n\nBut she didn't cause anything.", ">Honestly, I think she might be kind of hormonal.\n\nWell, she's already being condescending so might as well run with it, right? (/s just in case)", "Nah. Hormones definitely play a part in how I perceive things. PMDD makes my view of the world AWFUL because my body senses my hormones are out of wack and stimulates adrenaline and feelings of anxiety. Things I'd find bearable at other times send me spiraling during PMDD. \n\nSo yes, sister's feelings and reaction may have been influenced by her hormones.", "> I was pregnant with my sister.\n\nI was so confused haha", "It's more about how sharing banal minuta from our lives photographed with a pleasing filter has encouraged the sort of narcissism that makes a baby announcement more about getting attention and less about sharing happy news.People didn't used to casually debate about who was more entitled to the attention because getting attention wasn't supposed to be the focus of adult life", ">Oh, btw, husband died a couple of years ago....\n\nI can't believe you'd choose to bring that up now, when you know I was planning to go wedding dress shopping today. Now you've completely ruined the vibe."]}
