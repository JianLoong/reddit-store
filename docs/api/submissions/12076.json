We lost 2 pregnancies during that time, though we only told our families about the first. I\u2019m incredibly grateful to now be 13 weeks pregnant and have been looking forward to sharing that news with my family. \n\nOn Friday, we had dinner with my family - my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents - and we decided to share our news then. I decided to wait until dessert, so that we could leave shortly after telling everyone. Obviously, it\u2019s exciting news, but I was worried about all the emotions that could surface for myself and my husband.\n\nRight after we sat down to eat, my sister announced that she and her boyfriend are expecting their first child. I was thrilled for her and congratulated her, as did the rest of the family. Once things had settled down, I didn\u2019t want to waste the opportunity to have everyone together and thought it would be a good opportunity to keep the joy flowing, so I shared that I\u2019m pregnant as well.\n\nOur parents were so excited to be having two new grandbabies just a month apart and I was super happy that my kids would have a new cousin. My sister was happy for me but she left very soon after dinner and didn\u2019t stay for dessert.\n\nShe called me this afternoon and told me that as happy as she was for me, she felt that I\u2019d done a shitty thing by taking away \u201cher moment.\u201d She pointed out that this is my second baby and when I announced for the first time, I didn\u2019t have to \u201cshare\u201d with anyone. I didn\u2019t want to apologize because I didn\u2019t feel I\u2019d done anything wrong, but she finished out the phone call by saying that she didn\u2019t think I was really even happy for her, if I couldn\u2019t have let her have that moment and taken another for myself later on. That really stung.\n\nI truly didn\u2019t see it that way. I saw it as sharing joy, not stealing it. I also see each pregnancy as being unique, so I don\u2019t feel that it was right of her to say I shouldn\u2019t have said anything because it was my second baby. Honestly, I think she might be kind of hormonal. But I also want to understand my sister and I know I\u2019m not going to get anywhere asking her about it. So, I want to be enlightened. AITA for announcing my pregnancy immediately after my sister?\n\nETA: I\u2019m visiting from Los Angeles, my sister lives in New Jersey and our parents live in NYC.", "created_utc": 1678590812, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11p3oc5/aita_for_announcing_my_pregnancy_immediately/", "score": 297, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let her have her one night of feeling special. Have a family dinner the next weekend and announce.", "YTA, for exactly what she said. You could have waited for a different day and I don\u2019t think it is bad that she wanted to be in the spotlight a little bit. Like she said it was her first baby and she wanted people to be happy that they are having a kid. With that said disregarding her emotions as her just being hormonal is kinda mean.", "so OP, here's the real truth: it doesn't actually matter \"who's the asshole,\" because that's going to be an inherently subjective matter that depends on your personal views of how pregnancy announcements should go. what's important here is that your sister is upset, and you don't have to understand why. so swallow your pride and apologize to her.", "NAH. How often does your family get together for dinner or another event? You said you were out at dinner on a Friday so that means you are probably all local to each other. After your sister announced her pregnancy, you could have done the classy move of letting her have that night and just got the family together to tell them the following week or something. It\u2019s not \u201cwrong\u201d to announce the same night but it\u2019s not hard to see how she feels like her moment got overshadowed by you announcing at the same event.", "I'm going to go against most here to say NTA.\n\nI don't get a lot of the insanity regarding pregnancy announcements, the family was all together and you both had good news, especially you after having two miscarriages. Good grief, why do people get so weird when comes to these things?\n\nEven if you had waited to announce it the next day, she likely would have gotten her nose out of joint. I don't doubt that one bit. And the crack about you already having a kid...that shouldn't matter.\n\nLOL my mum got pregnant with me, her brother's wife and my dad's brother's wife all at the same time. Announcements came pretty much all at once (I was the first of the three to be born and I just asked mum about how she felt about all the announcements made together). Mum was over the moon for everyone and didn't care about having her moment, whatever that was supposed to mean, shared with her two sisters in law.\n\nI don't even find your comment about her being hormonal that bad. After her crack about you already having a kid, after you having at least one miscarriage she knew about was out of line. \n\nSo, nope, don't think you did anything wrong. Congrats on the new bambino/bambina and ignore sis. She was being ridiculous.", "NAH. Your sister has a right to her feelings and they're not unreasonable. But also, you had already planned to make this announcement, and you were traveling from across the country to do so. I assume you felt the need to go forward with your announcement because you wanted to do so in person and you don't always have that chance.", "Soft YTA. It definitely doesn\u2019t seem like you had ill intentions here, but you need to step back and walk in your sister\u2019s shoes. She\u2019s not wrong at all. It\u2019s NOT your first baby, but it is her first. You did steal the spotlight, even if inadvertently. I totally understand your joy, especially after what I\u2019m sure were devastating losses, but just swallow your pride show a little empathy for her.", "NTA. Are some of you insane? One sister doesn\u2019t own a pregnancy announcement", "NAH- You both were equally excited to share the news with family. You both spent time envisioning how\u2019d it go with everyone toasting you, being excited for you and spending the rest of the night talking about it. Both of your feelings are valid and real. \n\nHad you had time to think about it I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have wait till at least dessert or preferably another day to share your news allowing her the space to be the centre of attention for a bit before you shared your equally happy news.\n\nBut you got swept up in the happiness (and your own hormones) and shared right away. Hindsight is 20/20\u2026 your intention was good", "NTA, you already planned on telling at the dinner. You didn't know your sister was pregnant, too. It is exciting that you're both pregnant at the same time. Your parents were probably overjoyed to hear the news. Maybe your sister is a little hormonal. Surely she'll get over it and enjoy your pregnancies together. I hope so, and that this doesn't turn into some kind of weird sister competition.", "You are NTA. Second babies are not less important than first babies. You are going to be pregnant at the same time for the next several months. Your babies are going to be born close together. Is she going to expect you to take a back seat the entire time? Is she going to expect the family to give her child more attention than yours? You were right, this was an occasion for shared family joy. She wanted it to be all about her and she didn't get that so now she's acting out.", "Info\n\nWas this just a regular family dinner? Or was this dinner organized for the sole purpose of announcing her pregnancy?", "NTA she announced and so did you. You didn\u2019t do it \u201cto her\u201d you just announced to the family. Your sister is incredibly self centered and immature to react this way and make a fight out of it.", "Yeah, YTA. you could have done it at a different time. EVERY baby deserves to be celebrated but it sounds like you wanted to steal the spotlight from her.", "NTA. You\u2019re traveling and this may be the only chance you get to do it in person. She\u2019s just upset because she expected it to be all about her. It\u2019s not like you shouted it right after her.", "NTA your kids are going to be the same age.  Is your sister going to blame you for stealing \"her moment\" every time you announce kids' milestones at the same time?  Because inevitably, they will develop at the same rate.  When does the madness end?  A healthy family would see all of this good news as a blessing, not a competition.", "NAH, you were about to announce it & she said something first, that doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t also get to share your news especially considering you were only in town for a long weekend from across the country. I do think you should apologize to your sister because I can see why she feels like you stole her spotlight but I also think the both of you were rude to each other, you reducing her very valid feelings down to hormones & her for insinuating your second pregnancy isn\u2019t as important as a first.", "Soft YTA, because you might not have bad intentions but you obviously upset your sister. \n\nTry to see where she's coming from. She announces her pregnancy and you announce yours right after, which makes it seem like you're trying to insert yourself in the conversation and make the moment about you. \n\nI can easily see how she took it the wrong way, and you should swallow your pride and apologize, because I'm sure there was a wealth of different times you could have announced your pregnancy.", "This greed for attention is getting way of hand. Your sister does not need or deserve an entire day of attention from everyone just because she managed to conceive a kid. Everyone is happy for her, that should be enough. Her jealousy of you also having a pregnancy to celebrate is childish, ridiculous, and narcissistic. You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA. Your sister is being ridiculous. You just have easily said she stole your plans for announcing.", "NTA. You had already planned to announce your pregnancy.  It\u2019s not your fault that she beat you to it.  There was no malicious intent here.  She is just as guilty for taking away your \u201cmoment\u201d.  Every pregnancy is unique, especially one with a long and painful path leading to it.  I am sure your sister was aware that you had been trying for a second child. One would think that she might have considered your feelings. It isn\u2019t a competition.", "YTA  By your own admission you wanted to 'keep the joy flowing' which means people were still celebrating your sister's news but you had to take the celebration away from your sister.  You had planned on telling everyone during dessert and if you had your sister's celebration would have died down but you had to put yourself center of attention and take it away from your sister.", "NAH", "NTA. Your intentions were pure, to share in the moment of joy with your family. I could see how, in your shoes, it would be a bonding moment for you and your sister to share the joy of being pregnant together. \nI do think you should explain this to your sister, so she can she your pov. There's a big miscommunication that needs to be resolved.\n\nAlso, you should still apologize. Even though it wasn't your intention, your sister is upset and feels you took away her moment", "NTA. I feel like even if you would\u2019ve waited then your sister would of still said something. There is never a perfect time for these announcements to be honest. Congratulations to you both.", "NAH", "NTA - since everyone lives so far a part and it sounds like y\u2019all don\u2019t get to see each other often. To a certain point i could understand your sister frustration IF there were more in person opportunities but since it doesn\u2019t seem that way you didn\u2019t do anything maliciously", "IMO yta. Would have been no assholes if you didn't already have a kid, but you stepped on her first announcement in a big way, and aren't being kind about her reaction.", "NAH, you both had a plan to share your news and were both excited about your pregnancies. You didn't intend to draw the focus away from her excitement and joy, but you did, due to timing. It split the family's focus and attention. No one got to stay savouring and reveling in the moment with her. The mindful and empathetic thing for you to have done would have been to just let the family focus on the joy and excitement of her pregnancy, and to hold off on your announcement. Your intention was honest but the effects of your actions didn't work out the way you anticipated. Next time don't rely on your intentions; consider more deeply how the others might be feeling.", "NTA. I can see you being slightly the AH if your sister was the one hosting and wanting to announce her pregnancy, but she wasn't the host. It was as you said, \"sharing the joy.\"", "YTA. Switch the roles and ask yourself if you'll be as chilled and calm as you're expecting her to be. You could've shared at a different time. \n\n>Honestly, I think she might be kind of hormonal\n\nNot everything and every single mood revolves around pregnancy. She's not being hormonal. She's being absolutely reasonable.", "YTA. You should have waited for another time. You made her pregnancy announcement about you, when it should have been about her. I get that you were happy and wanted to share the joy, but most people would not be happy about sharing the limelight. My SIL was pregnant with her second baby at the same time as I was with my first, and I was not happy about it. If she had announced her pregnancy when I announced mine, we wouldn\u2019t have any relationship now. I think you were worried no one would be as excited about your second, so you hijacked your sister\u2019s big moment. Had you waited a week, no big deal, people still would have been happy. You should just apologize if it\u2019s not the hill you want to die on.", "Nah. It wasn\u2019t her event but at the same time, you could\u2019ve waited until next week since she had already made her announcement", "NTA -- but you might want to make a gesture of peace, since apparently she's feeling pretty bugged by what happened.  I don't see it myself, but emotional stuff is fairly often not amenable to any sort of logic.  at least tell her you never meant it that way, and you are happy for her and her bf.  can't hurt, might help.  and you do have my sympathy for your previous losses, so many people think nothing of it.  you meant well, though, so in my book, you are NTA!", "NTA your sister is wrong, but her childishness will punish her all her life. Tell her you're sorry the timing made her feel slighted, and get back to enjoying your pregnancies together.", "YTA. Wow you couldn\u2019t let her have this? It\u2019s her first kid! That is a big announcement and moment. She deserved the spotlight for a bit. There is absolutely no reason you couldn\u2019t have done it at a later date or even over the phone another day. It\u2019s your second baby, you had your moment. So selfish.", "I'd say YTA.  You didn't tell anyone you had something to share over food.  You had a child and she is right, she wanted the attention and you stole it.\n\nI advise letting her do a gender reveal party if she wants and just not doing a party for yours.", "1billion %YTA and if I were her I would go LC with you after this.", "Yes. \nYou literally said \u201cI didn\u2019t want to waste the opportunity\u201d \nBut that\u2019s their first baby and you have another child. Why couldnt she have one night about her first child?? \nI told my parents over the phone.

Sometimes people want to have their own special moments and bask in the happiness of their own milestones and important events, and they want their family and loved ones to appreciate those with them - without getting it 'undermined' by someone else's moment or having to have to share it. It's not self centered, it's human nature to want to feel important esp for something big like this, and a first baby is big. Your family's attention turned from her and her baby to both of you and made comments about how her baby is your baby's cousin instead of just being its own thing.

I might just have a different view on these things because of my family but it\u2019s very normal for people in my family to share what\u2019s going on in our lives whenever we get together because it\u2019s not something we do very often. \n\nIf sister wanted a day about her and the news she had to share than she should have organised one.", "No one sucks here/ ESH equally.   \nYou had plans.

Her first baby and your rainbow baby will be born within weeks of each other I feel like that\u2019s pretty special to be pregnant at the same time.

If as you said it's rare to have the whole family together, then this was clearly the night to announce it on. If anything, the fact you waited for the commotion to settle down before announcing your pregnancy too makes me think this is fine.

I'm not saying that towards your sister, she's likely just hormonal because of the pregnancy, which is understandable. But some of the people here on Reddit saying you're the AH. Like you people need to grow tf up and hop off the bandwagon of 'Boo Hoo they hurt my feelings WAAaaaa'. \n\nFrom your sisters perspective, it probably seems like you did it maliciously, but they key to resolving this conflict with your sister is to ensure she knows it wasn't with malicious intent. I'd say this to her if she was my sister: \"I freaking love you, I never intended to upstage you or your pregnancy. I never did it to be malicious. You know how the family things are, it's rare we can all be together. I had planned on sharing my pregnancy that evening before we even sat down. I don't want you to think I did this just to ruin your moment. I'm thrilled that you are pregnant, I'm thrilled that I am pregnant, we're in this together we can't be fighting over things like this.

You and your sister are both pregnant, and each pregnancy is special in its own right. Your sisters pregnancy is no more or no less as special and joyous than yours and vice versa.

That being said, you wanted to do it in person and there doesn't appear to be a lot of opportunities for that.\n\nI'm still a little baffled at why it's such a huge deal to have the spotlight alone.  If there are other issues(one sibling/friend is always outdoing the other) or they just plain don't get along, then it changes things a bit.

And then both furiously start planning matching cousin outfits and probably have a double up babyshower too with our side of the families, and maybe seperate ones with our friends. \n\nEither way, this is a joyous family moment.

It\u2019s not wrong or bad to want to be the center of attention for one dinner, honestly, and some people do want that. Is it that much of a issue to give them that space? \n\nThere\u2019s absolutely cases where people go overboard and take their need for the limelight too far, but a common refrain I see in these kinds of posts is \u201cugh, how shallow, can\u2019t we just SPREAD THE LOVE???\u201d which, you know, that\u2019s your attitude, but that\u2019s most probably going to lead to pissed off loved ones who feel like you\u2019re ignoring their emotional needs and denying them a special moment they may have dreamt of for a long time. It costs 0 dollars to uplift the people in your life by letting them have their shine for this one night/event, and then letting them uplift you next time when it\u2019s your turn to take center stage. if you don\u2019t care about that, ok, but some people really do, and it\u2019s genuinely not a big ask.", "I don\u2019t think the sister is angry just upset which I think she is justified. Nothing is saying the sister is unhappy for op jus that she felt op didn\u2019t need to say she was pregnant at the end of the dinner.\n\nI don\u2019t think op is a big asshole but a little one.", "Literally.", "Might I say the following\u2026 OP has already a kid\u2026 that is the first grandkid.\nI can tell you that kid has been doted on an been special on so many ways you won\u2019t believe it. \nThe sister is their to tell her parents and sisters that she is going to have her first which for them will already be the second. \n\nNow OP is the biggest YTA for announcing a rainbow baby. \nWe all know how much people gush and fuss about rainbow babies\u2026 so it\u2019s not a spotlight thing perse but this was not sharing a vibe thing this was an upstage thing and by call sister did to u/helomyo it was not the first time the sister felt that OP did not know the difference. \n\nAs for the oh but we live so far away we can\u2019t tell them any other time\u2026 boo f\u2026ing hoo that was your decision so don\u2019t take that into account when explaining it to yourself because that is bad.", "I still think she could have done it on a different day or time instead of during the dinner.\nAlso, personally and this is probably affecting my decision but I don\u2019t think it has to be in person. She should have let her sister have a moment in the spot light.", "She could of waited till dessert like originally planned\u2026", "Exactly they don\u2019t see her parents often or her sister", "Omgggg so much thissss!!!! Thank you", "The gathering was (unlike a wedding) not specifically for one of the couples. They just both happened to have the same news. Sis is TA for being entitled.", "What you're saying would be valid if sister had hosted that dinner especially to announce. As it was, it was a family dinner not anyone's special event. Both of them are entitled to share their news there.", "This was not a wedding. It was freaking dinner. Really? We're going to now chastise people who never see each other for announcing a pregnancy? The nerve.", "No it\u2019s not the sane because it wasn\u2019t someone\u2019s wedding, which they were invited to and it\u2019s the bride and grooms special day that they planned. This was a family dinner", "Both were having kids.  Why do you consider one an engagement onto another's wedding?", "YTA still you could have done it the next day.", "Who planned the meal out, was it you with the intention of telling people your news? If so you're not the AH. If it was your sister, then YTA as after she announced her news then it should have been obvious that she planned the meal to reveal and celebrate her news and as you were spending the whole weekend with your family, you could have then suggested going out the next day for brunch and revealed your news then.", "Agree! Plus with sister being much closer to the parents she is even more likely to be fussed over than OP. \n\nOP could theoretically get pissed at her sister that she stole HER moment since OP traveled all the way there planning to share the news.  Of course her sister didn't know in advance and neither did OP so it would be equally ridiculous.", "When sisters are pregnant at the same time you get fun stories like when my nine months pregnant mom went to visit my aunt in the hospital after my cousin was born and the hospital staff tried to check her in because they thought that she was there to give birth haha", "no, it's her second kid. they had two miscarriages while trying. it's still her second.", "Then I'm not understanding all these Y--TA judgements. My judgement is NTA.\n\nWho knows when the next reunion is supposed to be or how much longer OP was in town for. What were they supposed to do? Wait till the next reunion years later and be like surprise! I have a 4 year old btw.", "Cool story. My opinion is she\u2019s selfish. It\u2019s her sisters first baby and she couldn\u2019t let her have that moment. She always had her moment when it was the first child.", "Don't you know if someone doesn't get enough attention they will literally die. If you are at a wedding don't let anyone see your baby lest you steal attention from the bride. If someone says they're pregnant first you have to shut up and hide your pregnancy and put the kid up for adoption. \n\nNEVER STEAL SOMEONE'S ATTENTION. They will wither away to a wisp of smoke on the spot if you do.", "You had me until the last sentence.", "I agree she shouldn\u2019t have dismissed her feelings but you need to take inconsideration that she was already planning on telling her family the news so the only asshole thing she did was dismiss her sisters feelings", "If sister does not normally act entitled like this, then \"pregnancy hormones\" is a reasonable hypothesis.", "She\u2019s probably expected to wait until the next big family gathering in a few years. Sister can\u2019t complain about having the spotlight stolen from her then!", "Why can't two people be in the spotlight? Does everything have to be a solo? Can there be no duets?", "I somehow doubt the sister would have been less offended if she had waited till dessert to share the baby news. They both wanted to share the news with family and had clearly both planned on doing so at this event because of how rarely they can all be together due to distance, so asking her to completely abstain is just selfish.", "I\u2019m going with gentle YTA. I think the intention was good but I agree that it probably would\u2019ve been best to wait or at least privately ask the sister how she felt about it. I\u2019m hesitant with announcing on the same day as other people. I just feel it\u2019s rude. However, I do understand the distance concern with having everyone together which is why I\u2019m going with gentle YTA.", "If it\u2019s not important enough to need to be done in person, how is it too important to ruin the sisters moment by a second pregnancy?", "You think the sister would have been okay with that?", "Sister would have felt she was stealing attention either way.", "Hate this critique. If OP replies to those comments, OPs replies get taken as arguing with the judgment on this sub. Want it both ways", "This implies the second child is less special that the first.", "Sometimes, no. Some acts are just a solo and that\u2019s ok. Not every single last thing in life is meant to be shared.", "I agree, they live in different places and they both took the time to share the news. NTA, frankly the \"dibs\" on announcing baby news is just silly. If they got together every week maybe, but they live across the country. The sister is more upset she is just plain pregnant and it would not have mattered if she announced it next month.", "Better than immediately after \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Not for a second", "Surely pregnancy isn't one of those. Unless you view her boyfriend as irrelevant to her pregnancy.", "This wasn't a solo piece, they both had parts in this opera.", "We can agree to disagree then.", "Clearly I\u2019m just referring to the sisters since neither OP\u2019s husband or her sister\u2019s boyfriend are referenced heavily in this post.", "The pregnancy announcement certainly didn\u2019t involve OP until she came on the scene.\n\nOP wasn\u2019t even an asshole in my book by announcing their pregnancy - I do believe her when she said she just wanted to keep the good vibes flowing. It\u2019s a lovely sentiment, but unfortunately it wasn\u2019t a shared one. But instead of trying to give her sister some grace when sis told her she felt like she\u2019d been denied a special moment, OP decided her sister\u2019s emotions aren\u2019t valid, she\u2019s got nothing to apologize for and sis is just acting like a hormonal pregnant lady aka is being irrational when clearly, going by the responses in this post, a lot of people here agreed with her. Big yikes. Invalidating someone\u2019s genuine feelings is a great way to sour good relationships.", "Neither OP\u2019s husband or her sister\u2019s boyfriend are a part of the conflict so it's not exactly suprising they weren't mentioned as much as the two people who actually were.", "I love how you think!"]}
