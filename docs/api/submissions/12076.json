We lost 2 pregnancies during that time, though we only told our families about the first. I\u2019m incredibly grateful to now be 13 weeks pregnant and have been looking forward to sharing that news with my family. \n\nOn Friday, we had dinner with my family - my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents - and we decided to share our news then. I decided to wait until dessert, so that we could leave shortly after telling everyone. Obviously, it\u2019s exciting news, but I was worried about all the emotions that could surface for myself and my husband.\n\nRight after we sat down to eat, my sister announced that she and her boyfriend are expecting their first child. I was thrilled for her and congratulated her, as did the rest of the family. Once things had settled down, I didn\u2019t want to waste the opportunity to have everyone together and thought it would be a good opportunity to keep the joy flowing, so I shared that I\u2019m pregnant as well.\n\nOur parents were so excited to be having two new grandbabies just a month apart and I was super happy that my kids would have a new cousin. My sister was happy for me but she left very soon after dinner and didn\u2019t stay for dessert.\n\nShe called me this afternoon and told me that as happy as she was for me, she felt that I\u2019d done a shitty thing by taking away \u201cher moment.\u201d She pointed out that this is my second baby and when I announced for the first time, I didn\u2019t have to \u201cshare\u201d with anyone. I didn\u2019t want to apologize because I didn\u2019t feel I\u2019d done anything wrong, but she finished out the phone call by saying that she didn\u2019t think I was really even happy for her, if I couldn\u2019t have let her have that moment and taken another for myself later on. That really stung.\n\nI truly didn\u2019t see it that way. I saw it as sharing joy, not stealing it. I also see each pregnancy as being unique, so I don\u2019t feel that it was right of her to say I shouldn\u2019t have said anything because it was my second baby. Honestly, I think she might be kind of hormonal. But I also want to understand my sister and I know I\u2019m not going to get anywhere asking her about it. So, I want to be enlightened. AITA for announcing my pregnancy immediately after my sister?\n\nETA: I\u2019m visiting from Los Angeles, my sister lives in New Jersey and our parents live in NYC.", "created_utc": 1678590812, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11p3oc5/aita_for_announcing_my_pregnancy_immediately/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let her have her one night of feeling special. Have a family dinner the next weekend and announce.", "YTA, for exactly what she said. You could have waited for a different day and I don\u2019t think it is bad that she wanted to be in the spotlight a little bit. Like she said it was her first baby and she wanted people to be happy that they are having a kid. With that said disregarding her emotions as her just being hormonal is kinda mean.", "so OP, here's the real truth: it doesn't actually matter \"who's the asshole,\" because that's going to be an inherently subjective matter that depends on your personal views of how pregnancy announcements should go. what's important here is that your sister is upset, and you don't have to understand why. so swallow your pride and apologize to her.", "NAH. How often does your family get together for dinner or another event? You said you were out at dinner on a Friday so that means you are probably all local to each other. After your sister announced her pregnancy, you could have done the classy move of letting her have that night and just got the family together to tell them the following week or something. It\u2019s not \u201cwrong\u201d to announce the same night but it\u2019s not hard to see how she feels like her moment got overshadowed by you announcing at the same event.", "I'm going to go against most here to say NTA.\n\nI don't get a lot of the insanity regarding pregnancy announcements, the family was all together and you both had good news, especially you after having two miscarriages. Good grief, why do people get so weird when comes to these things?\n\nEven if you had waited to announce it the next day, she likely would have gotten her nose out of joint. I don't doubt that one bit. And the crack about you already having a kid...that shouldn't matter.\n\nLOL my mum got pregnant with me, her brother's wife and my dad's brother's wife all at the same time. Announcements came pretty much all at once (I was the first of the three to be born and I just asked mum about how she felt about all the announcements made together). Mum was over the moon for everyone and didn't care about having her moment, whatever that was supposed to mean, shared with her two sisters in law.\n\nI don't even find your comment about her being hormonal that bad. After her crack about you already having a kid, after you having at least one miscarriage she knew about was out of line. \n\nSo, nope, don't think you did anything wrong. Congrats on the new bambino/bambina and ignore sis. She was being ridiculous.", "NAH. Your sister has a right to her feelings and they're not unreasonable. But also, you had already planned to make this announcement, and you were traveling from across the country to do so. I assume you felt the need to go forward with your announcement because you wanted to do so in person and you don't always have that chance.", "Soft YTA. It definitely doesn\u2019t seem like you had ill intentions here, but you need to step back and walk in your sister\u2019s shoes. She\u2019s not wrong at all. It\u2019s NOT your first baby, but it is her first. You did steal the spotlight, even if inadvertently. I totally understand your joy, especially after what I\u2019m sure were devastating losses, but just swallow your pride show a little empathy for her.", "NTA. Are some of you insane? One sister doesn\u2019t own a pregnancy announcement", "NAH- You both were equally excited to share the news with family. You both spent time envisioning how\u2019d it go with everyone toasting you, being excited for you and spending the rest of the night talking about it. Both of your feelings are valid and real. \n\nHad you had time to think about it I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have wait till at least dessert or preferably another day to share your news allowing her the space to be the centre of attention for a bit before you shared your equally happy news.\n\nBut you got swept up in the happiness (and your own hormones) and shared right away. Hindsight is 20/20\u2026 your intention was good", "NTA, you already planned on telling at the dinner. You didn't know your sister was pregnant, too. It is exciting that you're both pregnant at the same time. Your parents were probably overjoyed to hear the news. Maybe your sister is a little hormonal. Surely she'll get over it and enjoy your pregnancies together. I hope so, and that this doesn't turn into some kind of weird sister competition.", "You are NTA. Second babies are not less important than first babies. You are going to be pregnant at the same time for the next several months. Your babies are going to be born close together. Is she going to expect you to take a back seat the entire time? Is she going to expect the family to give her child more attention than yours? You were right, this was an occasion for shared family joy. She wanted it to be all about her and she didn't get that so now she's acting out.", "Info\n\nWas this just a regular family dinner? Or was this dinner organized for the sole purpose of announcing her pregnancy?", "NTA she announced and so did you. You didn\u2019t do it \u201cto her\u201d you just announced to the family. Your sister is incredibly self centered and immature to react this way and make a fight out of it.", "Yeah, YTA. you could have done it at a different time. EVERY baby deserves to be celebrated but it sounds like you wanted to steal the spotlight from her.", "NTA. You\u2019re traveling and this may be the only chance you get to do it in person. She\u2019s just upset because she expected it to be all about her. It\u2019s not like you shouted it right after her.", "NTA your kids are going to be the same age.  Is your sister going to blame you for stealing \"her moment\" every time you announce kids' milestones at the same time?  Because inevitably, they will develop at the same rate.  When does the madness end?  A healthy family would see all of this good news as a blessing, not a competition.", "NAH, you were about to announce it & she said something first, that doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t also get to share your news especially considering you were only in town for a long weekend from across the country. I do think you should apologize to your sister because I can see why she feels like you stole her spotlight but I also think the both of you were rude to each other, you reducing her very valid feelings down to hormones & her for insinuating your second pregnancy isn\u2019t as important as a first.", "Soft YTA, because you might not have bad intentions but you obviously upset your sister. \n\nTry to see where she's coming from. She announces her pregnancy and you announce yours right after, which makes it seem like you're trying to insert yourself in the conversation and make the moment about you. \n\nI can easily see how she took it the wrong way, and you should swallow your pride and apologize, because I'm sure there was a wealth of different times you could have announced your pregnancy.", "This greed for attention is getting way of hand. Your sister does not need or deserve an entire day of attention from everyone just because she managed to conceive a kid. Everyone is happy for her, that should be enough. Her jealousy of you also having a pregnancy to celebrate is childish, ridiculous, and narcissistic. You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA. Your sister is being ridiculous. You just have easily said she stole your plans for announcing.", "NTA. You had already planned to announce your pregnancy.  It\u2019s not your fault that she beat you to it.  There was no malicious intent here.  She is just as guilty for taking away your \u201cmoment\u201d.  Every pregnancy is unique, especially one with a long and painful path leading to it.  I am sure your sister was aware that you had been trying for a second child. One would think that she might have considered your feelings. It isn\u2019t a competition.", "YTA  By your own admission you wanted to 'keep the joy flowing' which means people were still celebrating your sister's news but you had to take the celebration away from your sister.  You had planned on telling everyone during dessert and if you had your sister's celebration would have died down but you had to put yourself center of attention and take it away from your sister.", "NAH", "NTA. Your intentions were pure, to share in the moment of joy with your family. I could see how, in your shoes, it would be a bonding moment for you and your sister to share the joy of being pregnant together. \nI do think you should explain this to your sister, so she can she your pov. There's a big miscommunication that needs to be resolved.\n\nAlso, you should still apologize. Even though it wasn't your intention, your sister is upset and feels you took away her moment", "NTA. I feel like even if you would\u2019ve waited then your sister would of still said something. There is never a perfect time for these announcements to be honest. Congratulations to you both.", "NAH", "NTA - since everyone lives so far a part and it sounds like y\u2019all don\u2019t get to see each other often. To a certain point i could understand your sister frustration IF there were more in person opportunities but since it doesn\u2019t seem that way you didn\u2019t do anything maliciously", "IMO yta. Would have been no assholes if you didn't already have a kid, but you stepped on her first announcement in a big way, and aren't being kind about her reaction.", "NAH, you both had a plan to share your news and were both excited about your pregnancies. You didn't intend to draw the focus away from her excitement and joy, but you did, due to timing. It split the family's focus and attention. No one got to stay savouring and reveling in the moment with her. The mindful and empathetic thing for you to have done would have been to just let the family focus on the joy and excitement of her pregnancy, and to hold off on your announcement. Your intention was honest but the effects of your actions didn't work out the way you anticipated. Next time don't rely on your intentions; consider more deeply how the others might be feeling.", "NTA. I can see you being slightly the AH if your sister was the one hosting and wanting to announce her pregnancy, but she wasn't the host. It was as you said, \"sharing the joy.\"", "YTA. Switch the roles and ask yourself if you'll be as chilled and calm as you're expecting her to be. You could've shared at a different time. \n\n>Honestly, I think she might be kind of hormonal\n\nNot everything and every single mood revolves around pregnancy. She's not being hormonal. She's being absolutely reasonable.", "YTA. You should have waited for another time. You made her pregnancy announcement about you, when it should have been about her. I get that you were happy and wanted to share the joy, but most people would not be happy about sharing the limelight. My SIL was pregnant with her second baby at the same time as I was with my first, and I was not happy about it. If she had announced her pregnancy when I announced mine, we wouldn\u2019t have any relationship now. I think you were worried no one would be as excited about your second, so you hijacked your sister\u2019s big moment. Had you waited a week, no big deal, people still would have been happy. You should just apologize if it\u2019s not the hill you want to die on.", "Nah. It wasn\u2019t her event but at the same time, you could\u2019ve waited until next week since she had already made her announcement", "NTA -- but you might want to make a gesture of peace, since apparently she's feeling pretty bugged by what happened.  I don't see it myself, but emotional stuff is fairly often not amenable to any sort of logic.  at least tell her you never meant it that way, and you are happy for her and her bf.  can't hurt, might help.  and you do have my sympathy for your previous losses, so many people think nothing of it.  you meant well, though, so in my book, you are NTA!", "NTA your sister is wrong, but her childishness will punish her all her life. Tell her you're sorry the timing made her feel slighted, and get back to enjoying your pregnancies together.", "YTA. Wow you couldn\u2019t let her have this? It\u2019s her first kid! That is a big announcement and moment. She deserved the spotlight for a bit. There is absolutely no reason you couldn\u2019t have done it at a later date or even over the phone another day. It\u2019s your second baby, you had your moment. So selfish.", "I'd say YTA.  You didn't tell anyone you had something to share over food.  You had a child and she is right, she wanted the attention and you stole it.\n\nI advise letting her do a gender reveal party if she wants and just not doing a party for yours.", "1billion %YTA and if I were her I would go LC with you after this.", "Yes. \nYou literally said \u201cI didn\u2019t want to waste the opportunity\u201d \nBut that\u2019s their first baby and you have another child. Why couldnt she have one night about her first child?? \nI told my parents over the phone. And my husbands family in person when I was 12 weeks. \nWe came and let them see the belly grow but if it was someone\u2019s first vs my second", "Too many hormones here", "YTA", "NAH per se, but YTA for not understanding why she's upset. Sometimes people want to have their own special moments and bask in the happiness of their own milestones and important events, and they want their family and loved ones to appreciate those with them - without getting it 'undermined' by someone else's moment or having to have to share it. It's not self centered, it's human nature to want to feel important esp for something big like this, and a first baby is big. Your family's attention turned from her and her baby to both of you and made comments about how her baby is your baby's cousin instead of just being its own thing. You kind of stole her thunder and it's understandable she's a bit upset.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
