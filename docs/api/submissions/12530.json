My father pays my rent in my 1b1b loft. I got a part time job at a chain cheap mini market for some extra $. I began training a new hire (21f) We became work friends. She told me she was living in a shelter at the moment. She would tell me how awful & abusive the staff were. I offered to let her sleep on my couch since she just needed three months to get stable. We got her belongings from the shelter. At first everything was fun. It was great to have a roommate since I was getting lonely being on my own. \nThings started falling apart 2 months later. My parents didn\u2019t approve of her, she didn\u2019t pay rent and used 3.5x as much utilities as I did living alone. I defended her and said I was helping a friend out. My dad gave her a 1 month notice to leave which made her extremely angry and hostile with me even though it wasn\u2019t my decision. \nShe started talking to a man from another state. He had bought her a plane ticket and she was leaving the following Monday. On Wednesday before she left we were both at work. I was working until noon and she worked till close so I told her I would pick her up after work. (She didn\u2019t drive so I drove her everywhere. Sometimes to parties an hour away at early hours of the night in very bad locations where I didn\u2019t feel safe. No gas money ever.)\n\nI clocked out at work and walked to the McDonald\u2019s across the street to grab a coffee. 2 different customers from our store walked in after me. They said the \u201cmanager\u201d was making verbal threats and saying racist and graphic harassments about me and they feared for my safety. \nI got in my car and called my mom crying. My mom called my dad, who lived a state away at the time. I went home and quickly tried to clean the pigsty her side of the apartment had become. Drug paraphernalia, wig and eyelash remnants, takeout trash, alcohol bottles. \nI will also add that she had asked me to take my cat and stay at my moms that weekend so she could throw a going away party. She got aggressive and insisted that I couldn\u2019t be in my own apartment. \n\nMy dad drove in 3 hours.  I put her shit in trash bags. My parents had me stay at my sisters house a few minutes away in case she sent people to the house. My mom picked her up from work, drove her to her sisters house, got the keys from her, and gave her her belongings. \n\nThe whole time my parents told me to act like my dad was angry at me over grades and was making me live with him. She threatened me & also threatened to send my mom sexual photos of me that she had took the previous Valentine\u2019s Day. She called me a fake friend and really made me regret kicking her out. I felt like shit for months. This was a year ago now and I still feel like the biggest asshole in the world for kicking out a friend that was down on her luck 5 days before she was supposed to leave peacefully. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1679065661, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ttrho/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_less_than_a_week/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is not your responsibility to be the rescuer of another adult person. She is responsible for her own actions and she was awful to you, then she compounded it by making you feel unsafe.

You tried to be a good friend but it sucks that it was only one way", "NTA.  That was never your friend. What you described was a lot of abuse.", "NTA. Two different people reported her threats to you. Do not take that lightly. I hope your locks got changed.\n\nIt's good that you're kind to others but excess use of utilities, needing you to drive her everywhere and wanting you out for a going away party? You're lucky your dad threw her out, your loft wouldn't have survived.", "NTA, but please seek therapy for low self esteem and people pleasing issues. This person was NEVER your friend. She saw you from a mile away and took advantage of your generosity. Block her on everything if you haven't already and get the police involved if she is threatening you with pictures you never authorized for public consumption.", "NTA! Your parents did you a huge favor. She was totally taking advantage of you and was probably in a shelter for doing the same thing to someone else. Try not to allow people to take your kindness for a weakness. You sound like a very caring woman and thought what  you were doing was right. She owes you a HUGE apology!!!", "NTA - Love and cherish your parents, they\u2019re 100% keepers.", "Info: wait, you\u2019re 18 but moved out 2 years ago for college?", "Sigh. I am so sorry.

OP, you were exploited by someone who was not a good person.\n\nI am so glad that you have the kind of relationship with your parents that not only can you call for help, but that they will drop everything and drive 3 hours as well as setting up a story to protect you.\n\nIn some situations that kind of lie is the best thing to do to minimize the threat to your safety.\n\nDon\u2019t regret kicking her out.

He had bought her a plane ticket...\n\nI'm honestly concerned for her if this is what she's reduced to. In most circumstances this would be a stupid level of vulnerability, and it sounds like she had nobody to check up on her to make sure she is safe. \n\nHOWEVER...\n\nThe reason she doesn't have anybody to check up on her seems to be because she is a parasite who sucks everyone around her dry. If she's buying drugs before she contributes at all to rent or bills, and not even contributing at all to housework, she's just using you. Even without the threats of violence, it is clear that this friendship was very one sided.", "NTA She did all those terrible things to you and you feel guilty for kicking her out? She never cared about you, she was just using you. She was never going to leave peacefully because she didn't give a toss about you. You just fell for it hook, line and sinker. Please do not be so na\u00efve in future and allow people to treat you so badly. You deserve to be treated with respect and not be a total doormat.", "NTA but have your locks changed.", "NTA, \n\nYour parents rescued you from being taken advantage of.", "NTA but you have been an AH to yourself for letting this girl take advantage of you and walk all over you. \nThis is a valuable lesson: No good deed goes unpunished. You are generous and you have a good heart, but do not let yourself be a doormat again.", "ESH.  You are naive.  Drug paraphernalia, parties in sketchy areas late at night.  She had at least one or two probably illegal side businesses.  Firstly, your dad is paying your rent, so you don\u2019t get to move anyone in without his permission, ever.  He is responsible for what happens in that apartment and if you are in the US and she was dealing out of the apartment, the government can freeze and confiscate any money or property related to that location.  They may have to give it back later, but not after a long and expensive legal battle.  Do t put your parents in that position when they are doing you a huge favor.", "Her awful behaviour could also be the reason why she was kicked out of where she was previously living. I am sorry to say this but after reading all this, I am not even sure if she was abused at all.\n\nJust do yourself and your parents a favour.

You wanted to help someone down on their luck, but it turns out that person took advantage of you & you still feel bad. You have a tender heart, but please don't feel guilty about this. This girl did not have your best interests at heart & didn't care about you at all. I'm sorry it turned out this way.

She got free everything and all she had to do was pretend to care about you. She scammed you. She goes through life scamming people. First you. Then this rando dude. She shows up in a new place. Finds a mark. Tells a sob story. Lives the high life on someone else\u2019s dime. Then fucks off to find a new mark. Don\u2019t feel guilt cause you aren\u2019t letting someone rob you anymore. You need to let this go. Every time you start thinking about this stop and tell yourself \u201cI deserved better treatment then she gave me. She was not safe to be around.
