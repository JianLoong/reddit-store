He also learned to say \u201cAloha\u201d and found it fascinating that it sounds so similar to \u201cHola.\u201d He is very proud of his new bilingual greeting skills.

I was distracted searching the shelf for a particular item when another mom and boy about the same age, walked into the aisle.

Two in elementary school.  \n\nMy husband is originally from New Mexico and his mother and he both speak some Spanish. Our son is fluent.  Both of our daughters can speak it but only as well as my husband and their grandmother.  \n\nI am terrible with languages. Actually I am dyslexic and barely speak English.  If your son has an interest in languages encourage that.  Being somewhat bilingual has only helped my family.  What a better world we would have if we spoke and understood each other better.", "NTA\n\nit's actually adorable", "NTA. While I have compassion for POC who experience racism regularly and thus may jump to conclusions regarding an innocent child\u2019s excitement with a new word, you and your son did nothing wrong. Learning a new language is wonderful for many reasons. I would encourage you to let your son explore the Spanish language by reading bilingual books, playing Duolingo, and/or enrolling him in Spanish classes!", "NTA. I, too, great people with hola and aloha sometimes. Nothing wrong with it.", "My niece is in Spanish immersion and she's a Caucasian/indigenous kiddo. \n\nYour kid didn't do anything wrong and neither did you. Learning new languages is a good skill to have. \n\nBut prejudice is everywhere and it's possible that other kid had recently been made fun of for being Spanish speaking. So, he felt triggered. You never know. If he had enough time a simple \"hey I'm just learning\" probably would have fixed it. But the other one ran off too fast.", "One of my kids walked up to a little girl in Disney World and said \u201cHola, soy Dora\u201d the girl looked at her like\u2026you obviously aren\u2019t.  Same kid went up to a much older Asian teen at a park and said \u201cNi Hao\u201d. Both were obviously learned from popular shows at the time.  \n\nIn both cases I just had a chat with her and let her know that since she didn\u2019t actually speak the language, greeting in it was not a good idea as there was no path forward in the convo.  I also had a chat about how there are many languages and cultures in Asia so she probably shouldn\u2019t make assumptions.", "NTA \nSome little kid was overly defensive \nProbably got made fun of elsewhere and so he made a wrongful assumption about your young sons greeting.\nThat in no way makes you or your son an AH, it\u2019s actually a compliment to learn to say hello to people in their native language.  Let your son continue learning and being excited about his foreign language skills.", "NTA. I\u2019m Mexican and love when white people learn to speak Spanish.

I recommend Coco or Encanto to start off with because they show a bit of Mexican culture.", "As a Dominican that scans Black, I can tell you with certainty that there is no way to know by looking at a person if they are a Spanish speaker or not.

So far I have not seen him receive or discuss encountering a negative reaction. Most people either don't care or are thrilled when you try to communicate in their language.\n\nUnfortunately, as others have pointed out, some kids have bad experiences with bullying. Their experience of gringos using spanish may entirely consist of insults and stereotypes depending, e.g. where they go to school.\n\nSo NAH.\n\nEdit: One thing that might help in future situations would be to teach your son a bit more than just some isolated words. Learning how to greet someone more completely, maybe how say that they want to learn spanish, etc. so that there's more context than \"this person I don't know just used a spanish word at me\".", "NAH! That little boy has most likely been bullied for speaking Spanish.", "NTA I think that family is a one off experience. They may have had some type of issue in the past but that  doesn't mean you should discourage your son from saying hola. It's not that strange that he's learned that word either.

I think the other boy received mockeries and thought your son was doing the same. Not your fault, not your son's fault at all. An other time, maybe, he'll find a boy who will learn him more words ! That could be great for him ! \n\nI studied spanish at school for 6 years and I just remember \n\n Hola\n\nQue tal ? \n\nTe quierro mucho\n\nDonde esta la mama de Pedro ? \n\nI won't go to spain ! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NTA because intent matters, but keep in mind - white kids at my school DID used to do stuff like this to mock others. And people who have history like that? Might not first assume that he is just being friendly and showing an interest in language.", "NTA. It\u2019s cute that your son is interested in connecting with people who speak different languages and since he seems eager, I\u2019d see if some lessons are an option for him, either in person or an online service like Rosetta Stone.", "You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. NTA.", "NAH. \nIt's nice your kid got an interest in another language and it's definitely good for the future if he chooses, and you maybe help or encourage him as well, to follow this path down learning other languages. The other kid might have been mocked or is being mocked at school for his accent etc, so he most likely thought your son came to mock him as well. This is why I said earlier if you can also help or encourage him with learning a new language as probably his pronunciation of the word isn't right and can be percieved as mocking to other native speakers. \n\nSo honestly don't feel awful as both boys are young and both have different experiences. Maybe if you meet then again in a store you can apologize or your son could apologize. By then I hope you helped him on getting to know the language better, as he's currently interested in it, and has a better pronunciation.", "NTA. I have no idea what the other boy was talking about; why he'd say \"That's not funny.\" It seems a weird thing to get upset about. Maybe it was the tone with which your son said it. I wouldn't worry about it. Why should you feel guilty for someone else's crabby mood?", "NTA.", "NAH\n\nYour son did nothing wrong, and meant no ill intent.  Unfortunately, this other little boy who is about your son's age is nevertheless old enough to have been mocked in this manner by other children.  He didn't know your son's intent, but as he's only about 7 himself, he doesn't yet have the tools to assess in the moment that this may be something different than what he's used to experiencing.  It doesn't sound like the other mother reacted at all so she might not have even caught this interaction.\n\nNobody here did anything wrong, and while both little boys' feelings were hurt, it was ultimately just a misunderstanding between young children.", "When my sons were young, they picked up a lot of Spanish words from Dora. \n\nNAH.

And it's a really good thing that you support your son in learning other languages - the earlier you start, the better. Encourage him to learn more than just a greeting. Perhaps one day, when such a situation occurs again, he'll be able to explain in Spanish that what he said was not meant as a joke.", "NAH. I would take a guess that the other little boy has been harassed by other kids who said \u201chola\u201d mockingly. Think Dora the explorer, maybe kids bullied him and compared him to that, I don\u2019t know and we\u2019ll never know. Maybe it\u2019s time to have a talk with your son that even if you have no ill intent, sometimes the things you do hurt other people.\n\nWhat your kid did wasn\u2019t bad, saying hello isn\u2019t bad!! And I\u2019m sure in your experience everyone else was receptive to it. But maybe he can be a bit more sensitive to other people and be more perceptive with who he\u2019s greeting. He\u2019s old enough to understand that other people have feelings too. Sometimes people from other cultures are happy to be greeted in another language. Sometimes they feel offended because they were harassed in the past.\n\nEdit: wrong judgement", "NTA. There are many children tv shows and movies that are teaching children words in other languages. A lot of us grew up watching Dora the Explorer. That show was all about teaching us words in Spanish. Current shows like Peppa the Pig and Bluey are teaching kids words from the British and Australian languages. \n\nLearning other languages improves skills children are learning. Children want to learn new things and other languages can come easy to children while they are young. It's best to encourage it while they are young because I struggle as an adult to learn new words in different languages.", "NTA", "NTA, probably. But the other boy's reaction makes me wonder if your son is badly mispronouncing \"hola\"? Other than that, I can't think of any reason your kid shouldn't be using his new word in the right contexts.", "NTA.

He's a kid, so clearly NTA here, but being able to say more than \"hola\" could prevent situations like this from happening in the future. Also, what if he says hola and they reply in Spanish? It might be embarrassing/overwhelming for him not to understand or be able to reply back in Spanish. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust a thought!", "NAH. Your son did nothing wrong, but the other child is likely used to other kids making fun of him.", "I do not see the problem, since your kid i\nWasn\u2019t making fun of anybody.

It's great he wants to learn. Get him on some programs. Meanwhile I have people assume I'm Spanish speaking and just start talking Spanish to me. I don't get all angry.

They would then reply in very fast Spanish and my parents remember laughing with other kids' parents about how immediately confused I looked. Apparently that's a communication that spans language barriers.", "Yeah I had the same thought, OP isn't even sure, they \"didn't know at the time\" so I don't know how they could definitively know afterwards. The family could have been speaking Portuguese, which would make the response much more understandable. (But OP would still not be an asshole, obviously)", "When I was in college our neighbor was another student who happened to be Hispanic. A bunch of white dude lived further down the block and would yell out \u201cBurrito!\u201d Or \u201cChimichanga\u201d if we were all hanging out on the patio together. Gross", "N T A suggests the other little boy, *also* only about 7, is an asshole for this.", "I think there are a few possible reasons. All of what I\u2019m saying is coming from my own personal experience as a POC who lived in a place where, growing up, I was literally the only East Asian kid in the class, and I got bullied relentlessly for it by kids of every group that lived in my town, even though many of them were also POC. The below explanations might not be right, but they\u2019re still possible explanations that might shed a little insight as to why the other child was so defensive.\n\nThe first is that the other little boy might be used to being made fun of in Spanish, which might be his native tongue. I know that growing up, as soon as people found out I was Chinese, they would bastardize Mandarin and say \u201cChing Chong Ching, I just said hello to you!\u201d which is\u2026 well, majorly fucked up. But basically the kid might have been on the defensive because he\u2019s so used to being made fun of with his own language that he was trying to preemptively protect himself from a threat where there wasn\u2019t one. I know I\u2019ve been there before.\n\nAnother possibility might be that the kid and his family aren\u2019t even Spanish-speakers. They might have been speaking Portuguese, for example, which sounds similar to Spanish in a great many ways. To people unfamiliar with the languages, they could be confused. It may well be that OP\u2019s son thought that he heard Spanish when it was Portuguese, and the other boy might have gotten angry because he thought OP\u2019s boy was making assumptions about his heritage. I\u2019ve been in this boat as well; so many people have said \u201cKonichiwa!\u201d to me or called me \u201cKorea Girl\u201d; I\u2019m neither Japanese nor Korean. For me, it was insulting. The other boy also might have felt insulted that he was being lumped in with Spanish-speakers or felt that OP\u2019s kid was trying to be racist. It\u2019s another situation in which he\u2019s probably used to ignorant or malicious people and is learning to protect himself early.\n\nAll this to say, it\u2019s possible the kid was seeing mockery where there wasn\u2019t any, because when people do that sort of stuff to you, it\u2019s sometimes out of mockery. And when it happens often, you get used to being on your toes. That might be his situation. I staunchly don\u2019t believe OP or OP\u2019s son were in the wrong; that said, I also don\u2019t believe that the other little boy was acting with malicious intent. I think he was trying to protect himself from perceived mockery, and that\u2019s just really bloody sad to me, because I\u2019ve been there too. My vote on this situation is NAH.\n\nAnd OP, I second other commenters who have said that maybe getting your kid enrolled in some language classes might be fun. He might really enjoy it and maybe even have a new skill (language) he can use in life!!", "i\u2019m curious why this would make the other boy an AH then?", "why would this make the other party an asshole though?", "British and Australian dialects. It's still the English language, in fact it's even named after England!", "NTA and i totally agree with this. \n\nYou don't have to be an AH to offend people (unfortunately) but knowing only a greeting and some silly sentence can be genuinely annoying and a bit supremacist.\n\nThe adult version would be 'a cerveha por favor' (fyi i spelled it bad on purpose) which i have heard in the UK a bazillion times until it made me genuinely disgusted... Especially while knowing that I don't even speak Spanish, i speak Italian and Portuguese -_-\n\nYour kid is super sweet and adorable, I am sure, but it's excellent parenting to expose him to more than just greeting words. It will serve him well in the future, there is absolutely no age to start learning languages, ask any immigrant, and it will help avoid such disappointing experiences in the future.", "He\u2019s also at an age where learning a second language, even just parts of it, is the easiest it will ever be for him, and will happen more quickly and more effectively than if he only gets around it in around high school (which is when most kids in the US do). Obviously it\u2019s an extrapolation but if his interest holds and he pursues it, that\u2019s a lifelong skill.", "It\u2019s not their fault but doesn\u2019t mean to not alter behavior going forward", "why would this not be NAH?", "By the same token, how did the other child know OP's kid did not speak Spanish himself and wasn't just saying hello?", "That thought definitely came to me.

I\u2019m Chinese, born in China, but I can barely say my own name and I\u2019ve had people try to have full-on conversations with me in Mandarin. I usually understand some of what they\u2019re saying, but I don\u2019t have confidence in my grasp of the language enough to really respond. It\u2019s very awkward. I\u2019m going to try to re-teach myself the language again this year but we\u2019ll see how successful I am, as I also am going to try to learn Korean since that\u2019s my boyfriend\u2019s native tongue \ud83e\udee0", "Yeah, I've noticed a lot of Americans talk about Spanish as if it isn't a white/European language.

Did you really say only knowing a smattering of a language makes you a bit of a supremacist?", "Yeah he is too little to understand cultural appropriation and unfortunately it affects both boys but the Latino boy way more.

Colonialism culture at its best.\n\nYeah i am probably exaggerating, but that's a genuine feeling non native English speakers have. Probably kind of what that kid felt too.", "You cannot culturally appropriate language", "It's just a question based on your reasoning. It's not clear who you think the AH is here.", "He's also technically about the same age as OP's kid.", "NTA - As a Brazilian, we sometimes speak some words in spanish in a humorous way with friends, coworkers, etc, like the classic \"Hola que tal?\" and mixing spanish with portuguese like \"E a\u00ed muchacho\" or \"Buenas tardes pessoal\". Our hermanos from the surrounding countries just don't care about it, I know a few of them who do the same in portuguese among their friends. So, if anyone would find it offensive it would be Latinos born/raised in US or Canada most probably. We born an raised down here would only find offensive if some gringo were to offend, mock, etc, not if they try to speak in our language, try our costumes and do something from our culture.\n\nAnyway, trying to speak in other languages is really nice for him and specially considering his age. Try to fuel this interest buying him some books or resources in spanish so he can learn ileven more.

People will always get upset. That boy may have things going on that we will never learn about. \n\nEncourage your sons love of languages. I\u2019ve picked up little bits of so many languages and I just think it\u2019s gorgeous. Your son may very well learn multiple or parts of many.

Portuguese is probably the most similar but other romance languages are too, plus a few odd ball ones.\n2. Not everyone wants to make small talk with strangers, in any language. Little boy was not interested in making a friend today/wanted to be left alone.\n3. Small differences in pronunciation matter a lot, and your kid accidentally did not say Hello.

The other child has clearly been robbed of his own innocence, and mocked in the past, otherwise why respond that way?", "But he was also 7, and more than likely basing it off experience, the only paradigm he has at that point in life.", "Right, and ferventlotus said NTA which means that OP isn't the AH but someone is.", "That you should learn geography", "The weird fact that you equate Spanish with non-white people, I would guess.", "It's like you work off the assumption that all white people are racists.", "I am not American. Speaking Spanish (a white language) its not culture appropriation because it is not a culture and you can't appropriate a language. There is literally no race involved in speaking other languages.", "You're the one that sounds racist.", "Y? OP puede decir misa que el castellano sigue sin tener nada que ver con raza. As\u00ed que habla con propiedad al menos.", "Yeah. If only I could go back in time, I'd word the post differently to be more condescending about the assumptions others made.", "Yeah, that\u2019s exactly my point, they don\u2019t sound alike in Spanish, but specially for a kid, if it has the same kind of letters then they surely sound alike", "7 year olds aren't exempt from being assholes.", "I was on desktop and thought they were responding to someone else who\u2019d said NAH- my bad. On mobile now it\u2019s clear who was responding to who", "Ah so you are trying to say they are in Spain and that means white privilege doesn\u2019t exist? Technically Hispanic or Latino Americans are white as well, but their ethnicity is Hispanic or Latino. Their race is white. However white  privilege and xenophobia affect a lot of Americans because the general population is ignorant AF and tries to place people below them based on skin color or language alone.", "She mentioned Aloha which is a Hawaiian greeting, and Hawaii is in the US. The US has a huge issue with prejudice against Mexican Americans and Latin American in our country.  There is also a huge anti immigrant movement and using other languages in public, esp Spanish, can cause the ignorance to explode from the far right or just ignorant fucks. I doubt this took place in Europe but maybe?Here in the US people treat others like shit if they are a different color or use any other language than English. It\u2019s weird that you are up in arms by me bringing prejudice into this. Always seems to hit a nerve when it\u2019s brought up almost like people want to pretend it doesn\u2019t exist because it doesn\u2019t affect them.", "Omg no one said speaking Spanish was cultural appropriation. I said that could be the perception and why the other little boy got upset,  so have a talk with the kid now.", "But your assumptions are valid? Ok, mate.", "No, a 7 yr old hitting someone or teasing someone is being an ah. A 7yr old being hurt, NOT lashing out but expressing their hurt, and then leaving the situation, is not an AH.", "Mexican = non-white? You\u2019re really not looking good here, mate.", "But why are you talking about race?? What does race have to do with any of it? Spanish is a white language and OP is white. Race doesn't come into it at all. *Maybe* you'd have a point if the language in question were a non-European language", "Way to still not understand \n\nI'll be a bit more explicit. My assumptions were wrong, so we're the other ones. \n\nDoes that help?", "Of course it is being TA, that kid didn't know OP's kid, and assumed malicious intent when none was present.  That is textbook AH behavior.  Newsflash, 7 year olds can be assholes.  Just because the kid might have been dealing with some things and assumed based on his personal experience something about OP's kid that wasn't true, and just because he might have had good reasons for that assumption, does not mean the assumption was not still false and unwarranted, and his young age and emotional immaturity does not absolve him of AH status nor does it turn textbook AH behavior into something other than textbook AH behavior, and it certainly does not absolve me from AH status for this abomination of a run on sentence.", "No Mexican people are white. Never said they were not. Why are you so upset that I\u2019m talking about American racism? Don\u2019t take it personally", "I don\u2019t consider Spanish a European language despite the Spanish colonizing a huge chunk of non European countries. In the US, if someone is speaking Spanish they are less likely to be from Spain than a closer country to the US. I\u2019m talking about race because I believe this took place in the US where Spanish speakers are perceived as immigrants or not white, despite them being white. Racists don\u2019t care about the difference between race and ethnicity they just see a different skin color and harass accordingly here. It is very possible that if this occurred in the US (likely due to Aloha mentioned) the other boy\u2019s experience causing his neg reaction was linked to being mocked or harassed for using Spanish, being part of an immigrant family, etc. everything is about fucking race and if you deny it there\u2019s no point in continuing a conversation. Wake up", "That\u2019s what I\u2019d understood originally and then you made the comment about \u201cassumptions others made\u201d\u2026\n\nEdit: wait, no- \u201cwrong\u201d? How do we know the veracity of any of the assumptions?", "Doesn\u2019t matter if it affects me personally or not- prejudice and ignorance like yours will always upset me.", "I\u2019m not reading any further than \u201cI don\u2019t consider Spanish a European language\u201d\u2026 please, give me a link to the research you have published that gives you any sort of authority to decide things like that. \n\nHonestly, you don\u2019t really strike me as a linguist\u2026", "NTA. The other young boy was unfortunately sensitive having probably been mocked before by jerks. I think it's sweet that your son is learning new languages, and hope he continues... it will broaden his world and open up other cultures to him. \n\nLearning a new language is *so much easier* when his age than mine, ha! I'm in my 50s and trying to learn Italian as my husband is native Italian, and it's a challenge! ;-)", "NAH. The other kid has probably been mocked for whatever their ethnicity, which might or might not actually have been Spanish. But your son is literally a seven year old being excited about a new skill, and his intentions were not mean. It's just one of those unfortunate situations just because we live in an unfortunate world.", "Do people forget Spanish people are white though?", "I'd say NAH. Your son didn't act with malicious intent, and the boy's reaction was probably because of previous experiences of being mocked for speaking Spanish. I don't think either were in the wrong.\n\nHaving said that, I hope he can keep learning Spanish! I'm learning Spanish right now (English is my first language), and it's quite easy and very useful in the US if that's where y'all live. He's young, so it'll be easier for him to pick up languages, and he clearly likes it. I bet some bilingual or Spanish-only kids books, movies/TV in Spanish or with Spanish subtitles, and/or Duolingo could help him!", "Learn hello in every language!", "NTA My family says Hola all the time. Lota of Americans say Hola. The boy probably thought he was being teased because your son isn't Hispanic, but you and your son did nothing wrong.", "I'm not sure but... would that other person e..racist because of your son speaking a non-english language? \n\nThe boy is 7, he isn't aware of what Spanish sounds like in casual conversation. \n\nNTA", "They probably weren\u2019t speaking Spanish.\n\nDuolingo has a children\u2019s app that can help him learn Spanish. I suggest introducing him to that. NAH.", "I was thinking the same thing. Society is absolutely insane and there is no hope for us. truly. We're the dinosaurs looking up at the meteor and thinking, \"Oh, pretty star!\"", "the other kid was probably also 7 lmao, keep your weird ideology to yourself", "It\u2019s, uh, not a hard word to pronounce.", "Yes we\u2019re in the US. I get that, my husband speaks essentially 0 Spanish because he was told at school to \u201cnot speak that devil language\u201d which combined with my MIL putting exactly 0 effort into speaking it at home lead to him losing it completely despite it technically being his first language. Hes essentially receptively bilingual which is just so sad to me and a big part of why I\u2019m trying to be intentional about my child being able to speak it", "Hola", "In Europe, it\u2019s common to be a polyglot. \n\nIn the US, it\u2019s most common to just speak one language. Then everyone regrets the loss of language classes in elementary and middle school. Apparently, if a kid does learn another language, and tries to use it, that\u2019s offensive, too. \n\nYou\u2019re assuming, that she assumed, that based on your skin tone you could not speak English. \n\nOr, maybe she was excited that you might understand Spanish and she could practice. \n\nI\u2019ve worked with people of many different nationalities. I love languages, and would learn as many phrases as possible. If I learned a tiny bit of Mandarin, I\u2019d surprise my office mate with it. Then he\u2019d teach me some more. \n\nIf someone is being friendly to you, why be offended? Why think the worst of a stranger?\n\nThere are people out there deliberately being unkind, or even preying on others. If someone\u2019s actually being friendly, I\u2019d never slap a hand extended in friendship away.", "Nonono, if they dare to allow their kid to use Duolingo now, and he doesn't grow up to be an interpreter/translator, it was totally not worth it!\n\n\nLike, since when is a kid learning... anything actually, specially if he likes it, wrong?", "This is the best comment, hope OP takes the advice.\n\nLearning another language would helpful later and direct the kid in a productive direction!", "Yeah, but that wasn't the OPs question. \n\nHowever, DNA does present itself in physiological ways through features. My family told my and my bro all while we grew up we were of Italian heritage by our father. Upon doing DNA review for kicks, turns out, none presented at all. Which might just be why anytime I ever said I was growing up all the people I knew from Italian families said \"no way. You don't look it.\""]}
