He also learned to say \u201cAloha\u201d and found it fascinating that it sounds so similar to \u201cHola.\u201d He is very proud of his new bilingual greeting skills. When our in public, shopping or at restaurants, he frequently greets people in Spanish instead of English to show off. \n\nLast week, we were out shopping. I was distracted searching the shelf for a particular item when another mom and boy about the same age, walked into the aisle.

However, perception vs. reality. It\u2019s just like saying ni hao to a Chinese people or of any Asian descent.", "NTA", "NAH\n\nOut of the 5 states my kids went to school in they learned Spanish in 3 of them. Two in elementary school.  \n\nMy husband is originally from New Mexico and his mother and he both speak some Spanish. Our son is fluent.  Both of our daughters can speak it but only as well as my husband and their grandmother.  \n\nI am terrible with languages. Actually I am dyslexic and barely speak English.  If your son has an interest in languages encourage that.  Being somewhat bilingual has only helped my family.  What a better world we would have if we spoke and understood each other better.", "NTA\n\nit's actually adorable", "NTA. While I have compassion for POC who experience racism regularly and thus may jump to conclusions regarding an innocent child\u2019s excitement with a new word, you and your son did nothing wrong. Learning a new language is wonderful for many reasons. I would encourage you to let your son explore the Spanish language by reading bilingual books, playing Duolingo, and/or enrolling him in Spanish classes!", "NTA. I, too, great people with hola and aloha sometimes. Nothing wrong with it.", "My niece is in Spanish immersion and she's a Caucasian/indigenous kiddo. \n\nYour kid didn't do anything wrong and neither did you. Learning new languages is a good skill to have. \n\nBut prejudice is everywhere and it's possible that other kid had recently been made fun of for being Spanish speaking. So, he felt triggered. You never know. If he had enough time a simple \"hey I'm just learning\" probably would have fixed it. But the other one ran off too fast.", "One of my kids walked up to a little girl in Disney World and said \u201cHola, soy Dora\u201d the girl looked at her like\u2026you obviously aren\u2019t.  Same kid went up to a much older Asian teen at a park and said \u201cNi Hao\u201d. Both were obviously learned from popular shows at the time.  \n\nIn both cases I just had a chat with her and let her know that since she didn\u2019t actually speak the language, greeting in it was not a good idea as there was no path forward in the convo.  I also had a chat about how there are many languages and cultures in Asia so she probably shouldn\u2019t make assumptions.", "NTA \nSome little kid was overly defensive \nProbably got made fun of elsewhere and so he made a wrongful assumption about your young sons greeting.\nThat in no way makes you or your son an AH, it\u2019s actually a compliment to learn to say hello to people in their native language.  Let your son continue learning and being excited about his foreign language skills.", "NTA. I\u2019m Mexican and love when white people learn to speak Spanish. Like others have mentioned, get your son duolingo or simply switch the language to Spanish  on his favorite movies or cartoons. I recommend Coco or Encanto to start off with because they show a bit of Mexican culture.", "As a Dominican that scans Black, I can tell you with certainty that there is no way to know by looking at a person if they are a Spanish speaker or not. That kid had no way of knowing if your family speaks Spanish. NTA at all.", "I think you'll find most people will have a positive reaction when your son makes an effort to communicate in their language. Don't take this example as representative.\n\nI started learning Spanish this month and one of the youtubers I watch, [Spanish With Nate](https://www.youtube.com/@SpanishWithNate.), is as white as they come. So far I have not seen him receive or discuss encountering a negative reaction. Most people either don't care or are thrilled when you try to communicate in their language.\n\nUnfortunately, as others have pointed out, some kids have bad experiences with bullying. Their experience of gringos using spanish may entirely consist of insults and stereotypes depending, e.g. where they go to school.\n\nSo NAH.\n\nEdit: One thing that might help in future situations would be to teach your son a bit more than just some isolated words. Learning how to greet someone more completely, maybe how say that they want to learn spanish, etc. so that there's more context than \"this person I don't know just used a spanish word at me\".", "NAH! That little boy has most likely been bullied for speaking Spanish.", "NTA I think that family is a one off experience. They may have had some type of issue in the past but that  doesn't mean you should discourage your son from saying hola. It's not that strange that he's learned that word either. Lots of kids shows teach a few Spanish words. Sesame Street has been teaching Spanish words for over 50 years.", "NAH\n\nIt\u2019s ok for your son to greet people in different languages, and it\u2019s possible the other boy has gotten teased before so he\u2019s just guarded about other kids approaching him. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really any behavior you need to change on your side.", "NAH but I wonder if the family was actually speaking Spanish.

I'm mexican and work mostly with people from the USA and I love it when we talk and they add into our conversation the few Spanish phrases they know \"Hi' \"How are you?\" and \"Have a nice day\"", "That was a weird response on their part. \n\nNormally if you speak Spanish with a Spanish speaker, you have the same kind of conversation as you would if you said hello to an English speaker. \n \nDid he pronounce hola correctly, with the silent h, or did he mispronounce it so it sounded rude?\n\nNTA. Kids should be encouraged to learn other languages. This was just an innocent misunderstanding.", "NTA\n\ngoogle seems to think hola is hello, the other kid was probably trying to learn engleesh", "NTA\n\nIts a 7 year old who didnt mean to be offensive. Those parents have issues or maybe they have been insulted in the past. But I would consider talking to him about what happened, maybe get him to learn more spanish so his enthusiasm can been seen as genuine", "NTA he just wanted to say hello. \n\nHe should be encouraged to learn other languages because its a useful skill.", "NTA. I think the other boy received mockeries and thought your son was doing the same. Not your fault, not your son's fault at all. An other time, maybe, he'll find a boy who will learn him more words ! That could be great for him ! \n\nI studied spanish at school for 6 years and I just remember \n\n Hola\n\nQue tal ? \n\nTe quierro mucho\n\nDonde esta la mama de Pedro ? \n\nI won't go to spain ! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NTA because intent matters, but keep in mind - white kids at my school DID used to do stuff like this to mock others. And people who have history like that? Might not first assume that he is just being friendly and showing an interest in language.", "NTA. It\u2019s cute that your son is interested in connecting with people who speak different languages and since he seems eager, I\u2019d see if some lessons are an option for him, either in person or an online service like Rosetta Stone.", "You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. NTA.", "NAH. \nIt's nice your kid got an interest in another language and it's definitely good for the future if he chooses, and you maybe help or encourage him as well, to follow this path down learning other languages. The other kid might have been mocked or is being mocked at school for his accent etc, so he most likely thought your son came to mock him as well. This is why I said earlier if you can also help or encourage him with learning a new language as probably his pronunciation of the word isn't right and can be percieved as mocking to other native speakers. \n\nSo honestly don't feel awful as both boys are young and both have different experiences. Maybe if you meet then again in a store you can apologize or your son could apologize. By then I hope you helped him on getting to know the language better, as he's currently interested in it, and has a better pronunciation.", "NTA. I have no idea what the other boy was talking about; why he'd say \"That's not funny.\" It seems a weird thing to get upset about. Maybe it was the tone with which your son said it. I wouldn't worry about it. Why should you feel guilty for someone else's crabby mood?", "NTA.", "NAH\n\nYour son did nothing wrong, and meant no ill intent.  Unfortunately, this other little boy who is about your son's age is nevertheless old enough to have been mocked in this manner by other children.  He didn't know your son's intent, but as he's only about 7 himself, he doesn't yet have the tools to assess in the moment that this may be something different than what he's used to experiencing.  It doesn't sound like the other mother reacted at all so she might not have even caught this interaction.\n\nNobody here did anything wrong, and while both little boys' feelings were hurt, it was ultimately just a misunderstanding between young children.", "When my sons were young, they picked up a lot of Spanish words from Dora. \n\nNAH.

And it's a really good thing that you support your son in learning other languages - the earlier you start, the better. Encourage him to learn more than just a greeting. Perhaps one day, when such a situation occurs again, he'll be able to explain in Spanish that what he said was not meant as a joke.", "NAH. I would take a guess that the other little boy has been harassed by other kids who said \u201chola\u201d mockingly. Think Dora the explorer, maybe kids bullied him and compared him to that, I don\u2019t know and we\u2019ll never know. Maybe it\u2019s time to have a talk with your son that even if you have no ill intent, sometimes the things you do hurt other people.\n\nWhat your kid did wasn\u2019t bad, saying hello isn\u2019t bad!! And I\u2019m sure in your experience everyone else was receptive to it. But maybe he can be a bit more sensitive to other people and be more perceptive with who he\u2019s greeting. He\u2019s old enough to understand that other people have feelings too. Sometimes people from other cultures are happy to be greeted in another language. Sometimes they feel offended because they were harassed in the past.\n\nEdit: wrong judgement", "NTA. There are many children tv shows and movies that are teaching children words in other languages. A lot of us grew up watching Dora the Explorer. That show was all about teaching us words in Spanish. Current shows like Peppa the Pig and Bluey are teaching kids words from the British and Australian languages. \n\nLearning other languages improves skills children are learning. Children want to learn new things and other languages can come easy to children while they are young. It's best to encourage it while they are young because I struggle as an adult to learn new words in different languages.", "NTA", "NTA, probably. But the other boy's reaction makes me wonder if your son is badly mispronouncing \"hola\"? Other than that, I can't think of any reason your kid shouldn't be using his new word in the right contexts.", "NTA. I lived in Los Angeles my whole life and say \u201chola\u201d a lot, regardless of what the person looks or sounds like. It\u2019s just as natural to me as hello or hi.", "Nta", "Idea: If your son has an interest in languages have you considered giving him resources (duolingo, etc) to help him expand his vocabulary? He's a kid, so clearly NTA here, but being able to say more than \"hola\" could prevent situations like this from happening in the future. Also, what if he says hola and they reply in Spanish? It might be embarrassing/overwhelming for him not to understand or be able to reply back in Spanish. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust a thought!", "NAH. Your son did nothing wrong, but the other child is likely used to other kids making fun of him.", "I do not see the problem, since your kid i\nWasn\u2019t making fun of anybody. Tell him to start saying \u201cpree-vyet\u201d ( hi in Russian) or \u201cbonjour\u201d (French) and encourage his interest in language!", "NTA. That Spanish boy is probably mocked and mistreated by peers his age and likely assumed your son's kind greeting in his language was bullying him, which means that's all that the boy knows about his world of peers.

It's great he wants to learn. Get him on some programs. Meanwhile I have people assume I'm Spanish speaking and just start talking Spanish to me. I don't get all angry.

It's exhausting)", "This might be a stupid question but are you sure they were speaking spanish?", "NTA", "ESH because your kids shouldn't assume that other people speak spanish . The other kid might have been from the middle east, or maybe his family was already there a hundred years ago and they haven't spoken spanish for many generations. \nDefinitely you and your kid should understand that not every brown person speak spanish or is from latinamerica. \nAnd that there are many white, blonde , people who ARE latinamerican and have been for many generations", "No it's not. \n\n1) They were speaking Spanish.  \n2) for all we know they are talking trash about the OP or her son, and hearing the sun say Hola scared them.

We Spanish are white (mostly)", "Spanish is a great language. I wish I knew it, but my pea sized brain can only learn one language at a time, and I'm already learning Danish because I have Danish ancestry.", "have you ever heard of Spain, the country", "Pues cuando veas que en Espa\u00f1a somos todos blancos te vas a cagar", "I used to introduce myself to kids speaking Spanish on the playground with my Saturday Morning Special Spanish and that's all I knew. They would then reply in very fast Spanish and my parents remember laughing with other kids' parents about how immediately confused I looked. Apparently that's a communication that spans language barriers.", "Yeah I had the same thought, OP isn't even sure, they \"didn't know at the time\" so I don't know how they could definitively know afterwards. The family could have been speaking Portuguese, which would make the response much more understandable. (But OP would still not be an asshole, obviously)", "When I was in college our neighbor was another student who happened to be Hispanic. A bunch of white dude lived further down the block and would yell out \u201cBurrito!\u201d Or \u201cChimichanga\u201d if we were all hanging out on the patio together. Gross", "N T A suggests the other little boy, *also* only about 7, is an asshole for this.", "I think there are a few possible reasons. All of what I\u2019m saying is coming from my own personal experience as a POC who lived in a place where, growing up, I was literally the only East Asian kid in the class, and I got bullied relentlessly for it by kids of every group that lived in my town, even though many of them were also POC. The below explanations might not be right, but they\u2019re still possible explanations that might shed a little insight as to why the other child was so defensive.\n\nThe first is that the other little boy might be used to being made fun of in Spanish, which might be his native tongue. I know that growing up, as soon as people found out I was Chinese, they would bastardize Mandarin and say \u201cChing Chong Ching, I just said hello to you!\u201d which is\u2026 well, majorly fucked up. But basically the kid might have been on the defensive because he\u2019s so used to being made fun of with his own language that he was trying to preemptively protect himself from a threat where there wasn\u2019t one. I know I\u2019ve been there before.\n\nAnother possibility might be that the kid and his family aren\u2019t even Spanish-speakers. They might have been speaking Portuguese, for example, which sounds similar to Spanish in a great many ways. To people unfamiliar with the languages, they could be confused. It may well be that OP\u2019s son thought that he heard Spanish when it was Portuguese, and the other boy might have gotten angry because he thought OP\u2019s boy was making assumptions about his heritage. I\u2019ve been in this boat as well; so many people have said \u201cKonichiwa!\u201d to me or called me \u201cKorea Girl\u201d; I\u2019m neither Japanese nor Korean. For me, it was insulting. The other boy also might have felt insulted that he was being lumped in with Spanish-speakers or felt that OP\u2019s kid was trying to be racist. It\u2019s another situation in which he\u2019s probably used to ignorant or malicious people and is learning to protect himself early.\n\nAll this to say, it\u2019s possible the kid was seeing mockery where there wasn\u2019t any, because when people do that sort of stuff to you, it\u2019s sometimes out of mockery. And when it happens often, you get used to being on your toes. That might be his situation. I staunchly don\u2019t believe OP or OP\u2019s son were in the wrong; that said, I also don\u2019t believe that the other little boy was acting with malicious intent. I think he was trying to protect himself from perceived mockery, and that\u2019s just really bloody sad to me, because I\u2019ve been there too. My vote on this situation is NAH.\n\nAnd OP, I second other commenters who have said that maybe getting your kid enrolled in some language classes might be fun. He might really enjoy it and maybe even have a new skill (language) he can use in life!!", "i\u2019m curious why this would make the other boy an AH then?", "why would this make the other party an asshole though?", "British and Australian dialects. It's still the English language, in fact it's even named after England!", "NTA and i totally agree with this. \n\nYou don't have to be an AH to offend people (unfortunately) but knowing only a greeting and some silly sentence can be genuinely annoying and a bit supremacist.\n\nThe adult version would be 'a cerveha por favor' (fyi i spelled it bad on purpose) which i have heard in the UK a bazillion times until it made me genuinely disgusted... Especially while knowing that I don't even speak Spanish, i speak Italian and Portuguese -_-\n\nYour kid is super sweet and adorable, I am sure, but it's excellent parenting to expose him to more than just greeting words. It will serve him well in the future, there is absolutely no age to start learning languages, ask any immigrant, and it will help avoid such disappointing experiences in the future.", "He\u2019s also at an age where learning a second language, even just parts of it, is the easiest it will ever be for him, and will happen more quickly and more effectively than if he only gets around it in around high school (which is when most kids in the US do). Obviously it\u2019s an extrapolation but if his interest holds and he pursues it, that\u2019s a lifelong skill.", "It\u2019s not their fault but doesn\u2019t mean to not alter behavior going forward", "why would this not be NAH?", "By the same token, how did the other child know OP's kid did not speak Spanish himself and wasn't just saying hello?", "That thought definitely came to me. It could be another reason to explain the reaction", ">I didn\u2019t realize it at the time but the other family was speaking Spanish.\n\nI'm just going to leave this here", "Hard same. I\u2019m Chinese, born in China, but I can barely say my own name and I\u2019ve had people try to have full-on conversations with me in Mandarin. I usually understand some of what they\u2019re saying, but I don\u2019t have confidence in my grasp of the language enough to really respond. It\u2019s very awkward. I\u2019m going to try to re-teach myself the language again this year but we\u2019ll see how successful I am, as I also am going to try to learn Korean since that\u2019s my boyfriend\u2019s native tongue \ud83e\udee0", "Yeah, I've noticed a lot of Americans talk about Spanish as if it isn't a white/European language.

Does one have to learn all of the languages to not be \u201cannoying and supremacist\u201d? Just some? How many? Or is it the specific ones you\u2019ve decided \u201ccount\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s fine to know very few words, or none at all, of other languages. Unless you\u2019re going to, say, China, and don\u2019t bother to learn at least basic communication in Chinese.", "What the heck did I just read? Did you really say only knowing a smattering of a language makes you a bit of a supremacist?", "Yeah he is too little to understand cultural appropriation and unfortunately it affects both boys but the Latino boy way more. OP needs to have a white privilege convo to help him understand why the other boy may have been upset instead of just leaving it to hang in the air", "Why would you NOT just post your own judgment, sweetie?

These were 2 little boys of about the same age.", "I am super biased about this, I got tons of shit in UK by native speakers for my English accent, but then loads of them would come with these dumb sentences at me without giving a shit about what language they were even trying to speak.\n\nSomehow, in their head I had to be grateful for people saying a dumb sentence in a language they couldn't even identify, but those same people would correct the most miniscule bits of my English pronunciation.\n\nI found that racist AF. Colonialism culture at its best.\n\nYeah i am probably exaggerating, but that's a genuine feeling non native English speakers have. Probably kind of what that kid felt too.", "You cannot culturally appropriate language", "It's just a question based on your reasoning.
