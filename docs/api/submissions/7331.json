Also the silent treatment is very much not an okay way to treat your spouse.", "I think I\u2019m confused at all the NTA verdicts here.  I read this as doing a game *night* as in kids are in bed when mom and dad have some time to themselves?", "Oh hell no, you would end up hosting, prepping, and cleaning up after.  plus game nights can pretty boisterous, and you have sleeping kids.\n\nNow, if you bargain him into giving you a weekly day out by yourself or with friends while he takes care of his own children (NOT babysitting, it\u2019s parenting) you could decide if it\u2019s worth it to you.\n\nIdeally, you should start leaving the kids at home with their father for a few hours at a time while you shop or run errands or see a new movie or go to a spa whether or not you agree to a game night.  Right now you are his full time nanny/bangmaid. That\u2019s no way to live.\n\nNTA", "NTA and you need to not take the kids on errands with you so he starts doing more parenting to appreciate how hard being the main carer is.\n\nETA or go out on those nights so that he has to parent as well as host! And that means going out before bedtime.", "NTA. My husband has a game night every week (not at our house) but I also have a girls night out every week. I think if you both had the opportunity to have a night without kiddos it would be fair, but expecting you to do everything and not having any time for yourself is unfair.", "He needs to start contributing more if he wants a weekly game night. Get yourself a night off too at least. Nta for sure here though", "YTA\n\nWeekly is not that big of a deal. If you played it right, you could have a weekly break as well for trade off, everyone wins.\n\nTo compare saying he does nothing while you clean the house all day, work out, and take care of the kids. The flip side can be said to you while he leaves the home to work all day. You don't have to work out and you don't have to clean to whatever extent. That's a choice. The assumption that he will automatically take over 100% when he comes home is b.s.\n\nThe way it could be looked at, the way you have worked it out- you chose the duties (your daily job) to take care of the kids/clean/manage the home.  His (daily job) takes him away from the home. \"After work hours\" is a team effort with both parents not just one because the one stays home all day. He doesn't get a break either. Both parties are in the wrong on this across the board.", "You alternate weeks and you go first. If he bails, doesn't feed/bathe the kids and have them in bed at the usual time with the house tidy then he forfeits his next playdate, er, game night (sorry, but he's not acting like an adult here). Same if he doesn't clean up everything after his friends leave so you wake up to a reasonably clean home. NTA", "So, he gets a game night, a church night, and a couple of working out nights. You know what he\u2019s missing? A kid night!", "I think it also makes a massive difference whether he's at a game night in a pub or somebody else's house or if he's hosting it, adding the stress of preparing the house for guests.", "What if there was an emergency like OP was in hospital and it was up to him to look after the kids?", "THIS.", "You know that\u2019s not happening.

No problem I\u2019ll stay home with the kiddos. \n\nHer \u201cjob\u201d is more demanding than mine, and I treat it as such.

I bet she\u2019d give almost anything to have just other adults for company so she can talk properly. He gets that at work, and clearly takes it for granted.", "This is what my husband said. As long as the kids were alive, I\u2019d done a good job. If the the house was clean then that was a bonus!", "My husband and I had to figure it out. I thought that because I was home, it would be no problem for me to do all of the chores and cook and clean because babies sleep all of the time. I didn\u2019t realize (and he didn\u2019t either) that just because some babies sleep all of the time in their cribs from birth, that didn\u2019t mean ours would. And he didn\u2019t; he had acid reflux and allergies and would projectile vomit when I ate something he couldn\u2019t have that passed into my milk. I didn\u2019t know what to do. Initially he dropped so much weight after we brought him home from the hospital that they told me if I didn\u2019t figure out how to breastfeed, they were going to take him into the NICU. (Very, very hard days then\u2026) So we were both stressed and running on minimal sleep and then once we figured out how to breastfeed, I told my husband that I would be able to do the rest now that our son was thriving. My husband never actually expressed disappointment in me if he came home and the house wasn\u2019t clean, but I felt disappointed in myself whenever that happened because I thought I could do it all and that I should do it all. It took me almost 4 months to figure out that I couldn\u2019t and then my breakdown and then a bit after that to swallow my pride and my feelings of failure to ask for the help when I needed it and then TO LET HIM HELP. That was probably the hardest. I grew up around younger kids and was in childcare for years so I knew a lot of the \u201cbasics\u201d (how to change a diaper, how to give baby a bath, etc.) but he didn\u2019t. So I had to let him actually have the opportunity to learn how to do those things and not step in because I knew I could do it. It was a definite learning curve for us but I\u2019m grateful that we both now do more to support each other. We both have our own daily chores (dishes, folding laundry, etc.), but if one of us had a rough day or whatever, the other person will step in to do it. Then we try and switch off other weekly type chores (bathrooms, mopping, etc.). And childcare, while I still do the bulk since I\u2019m taking a year off work to be home with our youngest, he contributes more than he did with our first in that first 6 months and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m drowning even though we now have 3 kids. Thank you so much for being there for your wife; I know it doesn\u2019t have to be said, but I am certain she appreciates it as I have grown to appreciate how my husband is now versus how we were at the beginning.", "You nailed it, \u201cthought I could do it\u201d.  Then instead of asking for help you passively aggressively assume they know you need help. Men are dumb we don\u2019t pick up on subtleties.\n\nWe\u2019ve been together for 20 years and there are still tasks I suck at so bad she won\u2019t let me do lol but I can build or fix things so I\u2019ll take the loss on a couple things.", "You are NTA.

Only fair.", "NTA because it seems like he is not doing an equal amount around the house or with the children or making sure you have equal time to yourself. I bet when you see your friends it is with children along.\n\nI suspect him hosting a game night would mean you cleaning the house in preparation, making sure there are drinks and snacks, trying to keep the kids out of the way, he and his friends making noise and waking kids up, having to clean up after, him sleeping in the next day, etc. Maybe he should invite his friends to the gym that he already goes to regularly or church or give up one of those things in favor of a weekly game night.", "\u201cYou get breaks when you clean the house.

So fed up of men thinking their stay at home wives isn't doing enough. Honestly he needs to step up on his duties. Your comprimise was way more than reasonable. If he do his duties he can have his time. Really cheeky of him to give you the silent treatment.", "YTA. If you're getting time to work out and see your friends then he should also get some time to himself.  Work breaks don't count - you can't do anything meaningful on a work break.", "NTA the only way you should agree to this is if you also get a weekly night off where he is 100% responsible for the kids and house.
