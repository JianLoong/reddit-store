They are rejecting him and in his low state, he believes that means they are better than him. \n\nIn you come- supportive and caring. Instead of realizing that\u2019s what a good relationship looks like, he thinks that means your value is even lower than his. In a Groucho Marx mindset (\u201cI refuse to join any club that would have me as a member\u201d) he keeps seeking validation from the people who rejected him and devaluing the one person who accepts him.", "You should not always expect to be the top priority, but you should also expect to not to be the bottom. He's not that into you, and is probably complaining similarly about you to them. Choose accordingly.

The friends he \u201chates\u201d, the friends he badmouths\u2026the friends he keeps going back to.", "ESH. You know he's like this. Either accept it or dump him, but don't complain that he's exactly who he always was.", "YTA\n\nBen can have the normal ups and downs that come with friendships, without being \"helped to reduce contact\" with his other friends.\n\nHe's big enough to not be told who he is and isn't allowed to make up with.\n\nAnd in your example you weren't able to reach him because he was in a different location already talking to somebody, do you have examples of him avoiding you, or choosing someone else over you?\n\nIt's great that you are so supportive of Ben breaking up with friends. But consider how being told that if you make up, you can't talk about them with me again, feels?", "You should give him an ultimatum. You\u2019re his \u201csafe\u201d person so he treats you badly and tries to win the affection of everyone else. If you can get him to understand that you have a chance.

Why would you want to stay with someone who doesn't prioritize your needs?  This is not a partner relationship.  You want to be with someone who knows what you need & is there for you when you need it.  Not someone who's so worried about what others think of him that he allows himself to be taken advantage of by said ppl, ignoring you in the process.", "Exactly this.\n\nSeems like Ben is likely just very emotionally immature and when he doesn't feel \"prioritized\" in a relationship ( friend or romantic) he villainized that person and talks badly about them and how badly he is treated. Then like magic, they are the greatest again as soon as they give him the attention he feels he deserves. \n\nI'd bet anything that he speaks just as badly about OP to all these friends.", "I suppose you're right. He apologizes and says he'll do better each time, but I suppose this is just how it is.

But why are you so offended by my logical approach?", "The 1st paragraph:\n\n\"Ben has a variety of male and female friends, but has admitted *with each one* he feels disrespected or the butt of the joke.\"\n\nI don't want to speculate why he needed to \"admit\" how he feels about friends. But when the OP is asking if they are an asshole for telling her boyfriend to either stop being friends with these people, or not talk about them around her anymore, the goal of the sub is to judge whether or not she is indeed an asshole for this.\n\nSpeculations about weather there are factual actions the boyfriend has ever taken to justify her feelings aside (I asked- giving the oppurtunity to specify an actual action that is wrong beyond being with a friend during a specific time she tried to call him). If I were to speculate, it sounds like she is intentionally trying to isolate him, maybe she feels alone after losing her parents.\n\nBut all guesses aside, telling someone they have to lose friends, simultaneously because they spend too much time with them and yet supposedly don't actually want to spend time with them, is an asshole thing to do.", "I'm sorry but you are adding stuff to the post. OP never said they want their partner to stop seeing the friends, they said they don't want to hear complaints anymore, which is fair, considering their history.\nAlso, OP was clearly in need of their partner and had previously asked if they could talk later in the day, but was ditched bc of a friend who Ben had been wanting to end the friendship.\nSorry, but your approach wasn't logical.", "She didn't tell him to lose friends.", "Okay, I see I was making assumptions. I have adjusted the comment accordingly.", "But she \"supported\" him breaking up with a friend, and according to her, him making up with that friend is why she told him to not talk about his friends with her anymore. Ergo why we're here.", "That does not answer the question, ergo, your paragraphs have no value.", "\"The question\" was a factual claim, and you cannot answer those. But feel free to start responding to whoever's comments you're reading.", "Please copy and paste where OP tells him to \"stop seeing\" all his friends?  Remember?", "Do you regularly make up information not provided in the post?", "I remember. Are you aware that this isn't that comment?
