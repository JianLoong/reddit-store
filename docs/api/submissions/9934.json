Their guesses were white, red and black. We thought that this guessing game was quite funny and When it was time to send out the invitations (6 months in advance) we decided on a dress code which stated that the event is semi-formal and the only two colors we don\u2019t want them to wear are white and red. Therefore they can choose any other color (and before anyone mentions pink and orange: those are okay. We\u2019re only talking about bright red and bordeaux). In addition: as we\u2019re getting married in March, there\u2019s a big possibility of it still having snow as well as all our florals are green I don\u2019t want there to be a \u201cChristmas-y\u201d Vibe. \n\nI got in an argument with our Best Mans GF (full disclosure: I don\u2019t like her. I tried multiple times to find any redeeming qualities in her but as it seems we just can\u2019t stand esch other) twice: First when she asked me if she could wear a floor length white lace gown and second when she got herself a Bordeaux Velvet gown. At first I kindly asked her not to wear those dresses as the dress code states and it would be disrespectful to the other guests that are dressing according to it and to us as hosts.\n\nAfter a while she got her BF involved and made him confront me about being unreasonable and that her, as his GF, should hold a \u201cspecial position\u201d in our wedding and therefore be exempt from the dress code. I became really stubborn and told them again, that there are multiple other colors available, that it\u2019s not a big deal for her not to wear those two colors and I even offered her one of my dresses or even to sew her the exact same dress in a different color. They got angry and stormed off.\n\nAm I the Asshole here?\n\nAdditional Information: \n- She bought the red dress, she already owned the white one. She\u2019s well in the financial situation to buy a new dress. \n- I myself offered her to go through my closet and choose a dress (I have a lot of formal and semi-formal dresses). I even would have made alterations to it to fit her. \n- in case it matters: We\u2019re paying for everything which includes an open bar and a four-course-meal. They don\u2019t pay for anything on the wedding. We don\u2019t have a registry.\n\nEDIT: \n- The \u201cNo white\u201d rule of course doesn\u2019t count for mens dress shirts (as a white shirt is kind of a default staple for a suit)! It\u2019s for dresses and suits (the red as well)\n- As the question got asked: My fianc\u00e9 agrees with me. \n- uninviting her/choosing a different BM (all tough IMO he did a bad job until now aka nearly nothing) is difficult as the BM is my fianc\u00e9s cousin.

I mean should the maid of honors dog groomer be allowed to attend and wear a wedding gown?", "> she asked me if she could wear a floor length white lace gown\n\nA floor length white lace gown. At *your* wedding. \n\nNTA, wtf lol. \n\nI get in some cultures the bride doesn't wear white, and this would be perfectly fine. Reading your post, I feel like that's not the case tho. I mean, I'm starting to understand why you don't like her. \n\nInsisting on the two colors you asked guests not to wear (not always ideal, but it's your wedding and nobody *has* to attend if they don't like the dress code.) Throwing the fit, saying she should be exempt from the dress code...because she's just that special. Please. Lmao. Nope, nta.", "In my opinion you are NTA you had two reasonable requests don't wear white or red that went for all the guests including her. It is your wedding and YOUR special day NOT hers. You even tried to compromise with her to settle this and she was not willing to. Again NTA", "NTA. Someone needs to explain her that \u201cspecial positions\u201d in a wedding are only reserved for the bride and groom. Being the best man\u2019s gf makes her nothing but the +1 of the best man.

It\u2019s definitely an AH move to be like, \u201csurely this doesn\u2019t apply to me.\u201d And then for her to be argumentative over it\u2026 she sounds like a peach.", "NTA, people not wearing white to a wedding is a given and should not come as a shock to people. She shouldn\u2019t of even asked about a damn white lace gown \ud83d\ude05 As for demanding she\u2019s special and, therefore, should be allowed to be the only one in red is just laughable, the audacity! \n\nMake sure to hire some bouncers for the wedding so they can turn away the guests not following the dress code.", "She\u2019s seriously thinks she\u2019s entitled to special treatment because she\u2019s the best man\u2019s girlfriend??? It\u2019s like the military wife meme, \u201cyou will address me by my husband\u2019s rank.\u201d  I\u2019m not a big fan of dictating what colors guests wear (other than not wearing whatever the traditional bride color is), but apparently you had some kind of game about it, so NTA.", "Never been to a wedding, but dress code sounds like a fairly basic thing to adhere to. It also sounds like the GF bought the red gown after receiving the invitation. At that point you're not just ignoring the dress code, you're outright and very purposefully challenging it. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. First of all, it\u2019s your wedding, not theirs. I\u2019m not overly familiar with western wedding traditions but I\u2019m pretty sure it is not uncommon for the couple to set a dress code that everyone follows. That sounds pretty normal.\n\nSecond, it isn\u2019t like you made last minute demands that the best man\u2019s gf choose a different dress on the morning of the wedding. I think you\u2019re being very reasonable, and going above and beyond by offering to help her pick a dress.\n\nThird, Christ that best man is an AH. The wedding is about you and your fianc\u00e9, and he is making it about himself. That is some entitled shit right there and if my best man said that to my fianc\u00e9e I\u2019d be reconsidering having him as my best man. \n\nOP I think you did nothing wrong. Maybe your dress code is a tad on the strict side for me (like with the no red), but it\u2019s your right to have it that way and I think you were being extra reasonable to accommodate best man\u2019s gf.\n\nInfo: what does your fianc\u00e9 think?", "NTA \n\nFirst, it\u2019s common courtesy not to wear white to a wedding that is not your own\u2026so that question was ridiculous from the start (especially lace, what is she trying to do? Look like a bride?). Second, you said no red\u2026that\u2019s also not an unreasonable request. More importantly, you also offered her a compromise. \n\nShe has no right to request special treatment on the day of YOUR wedding (not hers) just because she is the best man\u2019s gf! That\u2019s utterly freaking ridiculous in all honesty, and speaks volumes to her entitlement. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d talk to your fianc\u00e9 since this is his best man, and he should be the one backing you up and taking care of this. I would also let your fianc\u00e9 know that if she chooses not to follow dress code she will either be uninvited or asked to leave day of (and I would make sure security or a family member knows this and takes care of it day of so you don\u2019t have to). \n\nYour day is not about her. End of story. She\u2019s a guest only, and holds no special privileges\u2026regardless of who she\u2019s dating! \n\nBest of luck! And congratulations on your impending nuptials.", "NTA\nFor all the reasons above. You're eliminating 2 colors, one of which is totally forbidden.\nThe best man's GF doesn't want a splash of red on her dress, she wants a dress that's entirely a forbidden color. Come on, there's no way this isn't intentional.", "You aren\u2019t TA, it is your wedding and gave guests a lot of notice of the dress code before the wedding and made it very clear not white or red. You tried to help her with a solution to her dress situation which none were taken and explained how it would be rude if she was the only one aloud to go against the very clear dress code. She is TA and especially for getting the best man involved. Solution uninvited her", "NTA. It is your day. If people can't wrap their head around the fact that it is an honour and privilege to be invited to a wedding. They need go check themselves. \n\nI have seen this become a big issue for my friends currently and I'm dumbfounded how people are so fucking petty that they can't understand that it's not their day. Yeah NTA.", "NTA.  It's your wedding. If you ask people ahead of time to not wear 2 colors, then that is your right.  Good news is that she has many other colors to choose from.\n\nAlso, I don't understand why his girlfriend should be special to you. Regardless of how you feel about her, there are only 2 special people that matter that day and she ain't one.", "NTA.\n\nFirst, if you're in a western country the default position is \"don't wear white unless specifically told it's ok\" - she didn't need to ask, it's simply a known fact. \n\nLimiting other colors is fine, particularly since you only requested they not wear one. That's really easy to accommodate and not uncommon. She might not like it (which is fine, she doesn't have to), but it's normal courtesy to abide by it. It's simply not a big deal.\n\nWhere she gets ridiculous is asking for some sort of exception - if she really thinks she holds a \"special position\" as being the girlfriend of someone in the wedding party (hint: that's not a special position, at all), then that's actually MORE reason that she need to adhere to your requests. Is your maid of honor following your requests? Other bridesmaids? Your mother?  Of course they are! Those are people with actual special positions.\n\nYou and your partner need to be on the same page on this - she is out of line and needs to stop being an asshole. What I worry about is that this will have an effect on your partner's relationship with the best man. I hate to see the best man's petty and entitled girlfriend come between them, but that very well might be the case here. Hopefully this doesn't lead to a strain in your relationship with your partner.", "NTA, \n\nIt\u2019s your wedding, realistically what you say goes.\n\nYou even went to lengths to accommodate her which you didn\u2019t have to do..\n\nNot sure why she thinks it\u2019s okay to make YOUR wedding about HER lol.", "sounds like she is deliberately going out of her way to get special treatment by throwing a tantrum. seriously, not allowed to wear ONLY TWO COLORS? then choose, idk, literally anything else. give yourself the gift of uninviting her AND the best man. NTA.", "NTA, it seems like you\u2019ve offered a *ton* of alternatives. She wants special treatment and that\u2019s honestly a little absurd", "As much as I personally find asking guests to avoid wearing certain colors annoying, NTA.\n\nIt is very clear you two aren't exactly the best of friends and her being the gf of the best man doesn't entitle her to special treatment. You have offered her a lot of alternatives that she can choose from, and guess what she chose? She chose being difficult. \n\nLet it go OP, just enjoy your day without having to worry about someone you don't even like. Put your foot down with her, if she agrees fine, if she doesn't, uninvite her,", "Nta your wedding your rules. \n\nAlso like there's a million colors and she wants to be an ass and want to wear the two colors you said no too. \n\nAnd what special position does she have? Not maid of honor or brides maid. You don't even like her. I'm pretty sure she's only there cause her bf is the best man.", "NTA. She\u2019s an entitled jackass and best man is going to have problems if he marries her.", "NTA, This girl has big I AM THE MAIN CHARACTER vibes going for her. Please stop this right in it's track and dont invite this evil hag, the best man is pretty shitty as well, it's your wedding at the end of the day not her special day wtf", "NTA you have asked your guest to follow two simple instructions. Your request is not \u201cplease wear neon green and hot pink\u201d it\u2019s do not wear white which is easily recognized as the color brides wear. Now, on to the red, this one is unique because wearing red to a wedding indicates that the person has slept with the groom. Both colors should be avoided unless it is requested as appropriate attire in the invitation. \n\nShe is trying start some shit where there should be no shit. This is your wedding. It\u2019s simple, tell her and her boyfriend this is not up for discussion or negotiation if she shows up and either color she\u2019s will be removed, it won\u2019t be done quietly and discreetly as it was put in the invitation. If Dude decides to back his girlfriend on this, have a backup plan for his spot, like two brides maids to one groomsmen.", "NTA. \n\nNot wearing a white gown to a wedding where white is traditionally the colour the bride wears is pretty self explanatory. \n\nI think where perhaps you messed up a bit is in saying \"don't wear red\". Some people may have assumed you only meant a true red, others may have interpreted it as any shade of red. \n\nI can see why this girl *might* have felt some frustration if the red portion wasn't clarified. Bordeaux as a colour can skew a bit more of a reddish purple and depending on her eye she may have seen more purple than red.", "ESH. Not wearing white to a wedding is sort of a given, so she was being difficult on purpose. But I have also NEVER been to a wedding with a specified dress code. That sounds immature and annoying. Most guests will wear something nice without being told.  But dictating colors, that's just you being superficial.\n\nHonestly, you should just be happy your guests have come to celebrate and revel in the joy with your fiance. Who cares what anyone wears?!

It looks to be a deep red wine color on velvet fabric.", "I wondered if it was a special velvet as opposed to a certain color.\n\nThank you for doing the leg work lol", "I am not at all an expert on fabrics, LOL.  For all I know it could be special velvet. To me, the fact that it is velvet would stand out from other dresses at the wedding. Which this gal is wanting to do.", "Fair and same lol", "NTA. First off, I\u2019m not too well versed on wedding etiquette but I feel like asking for there to be a color/theme is pretty standard in general. Aside from that, who the fuck wears a floor length white lace gown to a wedding that isn\u2019t theirs? Sounds like attention seeking issues.", "[removed]", "NTA, and she deserves some kind of award for occupying your time and attention. She's obviously someone who craves it. Hard to understand how her BF can stand being around her, but maybe for him it's evidence that he's special. Relax though, once the wedding is past you can avoid being in close contact.", "OP, have you and FH discussed this with his parents and family? It seems to me that going through the channels of the older generation should calm this chick down. The groom's aunt or uncle is the parent of the best man---surely some family pressure can be applied? Does grandma know that her other grandson's GF is behaving this way?\n\nIf family relationships are so close that the groom's best man is his cousin, I would think there are roads for pressure here. If my son's GF was behaving this was about going to my nephew's wedding, I'd like to know about it.", "Your best man is going to propose at your wedding. Or worse, she'll come anyways and toss your demands or the window.\n\nFire your disrespectful cousin-in-laws as the power couple AT YOUR WEDDING. Show your fiance this post. Find a new BM. You will regret letting her come to your *once in a lifetime* event. NTA unless you let that woman try to control you.", "The weirdest thing is these are already colours against etiquette to wear at a wedding. White is supposed to be bride only, red means you slept with the groom, and black is bad luck (though most people don't care about this one much.) OP has another post were they specifically mention the white floor length gown being a wtf thing, so it's obviously a western wedding were these rules are well known. The only \"new\" thing is the slightly more policing on the men's clothing.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
