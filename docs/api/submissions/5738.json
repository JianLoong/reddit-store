Most of you agreed that I was NTA but many pointed out that the punishment did not fit the offense and was just meant to hurt. After thinking it over I agree.  \n\nI decided to sit Pam down and ask her why she had made the video. She kept saying she didn't know and crying. I explained how this could ruin her future, the bullying that people who are LGBTQ+ face and the consequences of said bullying, and how terrible it is that she would do this to someone who has treated her very well for as long as he's known her.  \n\nPam said that several members of the soccer team had used the f-slur to refer to Bruce after they saw how he was always baking and cooking for fun. She didn't like it but felt if she didn't agree, then she would be ostracized.  \n\nShe agreed to delete the video and apologized to Bruce for her actions. He accepted her apology.  \n\nMany people suggested that I make Pam and her friends cook for the next team dinner. Soccer season is over, so there are no team dinners until next year. However, Annie's gymnastic class had their family dinner/holiday party on the 16th, which happened to be the same night as the Holiday dance at the high school.  \n\nI contacted the parents of the girls who appeared in the video. A few asked to see the video, and all were deeply embarrassed and ashamed. I told them that we were willing to delete the video and would not refer it to the school as long as the girls apologized to Bruce, helped to prepare the food for the gymnastics dinner, and gave up the dance to volunteer at the party and serve meals. Every parent I spoke with was very grateful and agreed it was a fair consequence of their actions.  \n\nSo every day after school from Monday - Thursday the girls came over and worked in our kitchen, cutting up vegetables, boiling pasta, breading chicken, layering lasagna, making buttercream, mixing up cake batter, rolling out cookie dough, cutting cookies, washing dishes, and just about anything else we could find for them.  \n\nAt the end of Thursday, I asked the girls what part of what they did this week was gay. None of them had an answer. All of them approached Bruce at some point and apologized for being a part of the video.  \n\nAt the end of the party on Friday, two of the girls asked Bruce if he could teach them how to prepare a few of the meals he made for team dinners in the past, and he agreed. I realize not every girl who made fun of Bruce may have been in the video but a very clear message was sent. We have decided to still hold the sweet sixteen.  \n\nAfter sitting down with Marco, he explained he'd never heard anything said by the team before, didn't realize it was a team-wide issue, apologized for not having my back, and agreed that it was a fair punishment. He also promised if he heard any slurs from anyone, it would be the end of their time on the team.", "created_utc": 1672111511, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zw5brg/update_aita_for_canceling_my_daughters_16th/", "score": 4021, "replies": ["Wow. This is a great update!\n\nSeems like all the parents got onboard to show silly teenagers that their words hurt. \n\nTeenagers do lots of dumb stuff because they are dumb and testing all the boundaries in life. \n\nHaving all the adults onboard to basically band together and explain how this language is hurtful and that is not Ok is the absolute best result. \n\nThese type of conversations along with working with the person they were being hurtful to will go a long way into making them empathetic adults who understand why you don\u2019t do things rather than a simple punishment!\n\nGood parenting", "You're a really good mom.

I'm glad you realized the punishment didn't fit the time and then pushed for more information.  \n\n\nKnowing teenage life (and, sadly, sometimes adult life), kids often feel pushed to do negative things because someone else starts it.  It's very hard to be the one standing up, so I don't blame her for not.  Girls are especially good at emotional hurting.  \n\n\nExcellent overall solution.", "I wish we had more updates like this. I really hope your daughter and her friends learned from their mistakes and realized that their words and actions have consequences. Life gets a lot more serious when you're caught bullying outside of the protection of school and extra curriculars. Something like that as an adult could have cost them all their jobs, school scholarships or even admission, and so much more. I hope that you took the time to go over some of those consequences too.

You are a great Mum, and hearing how the other parents had your back made me tear up!\n\nI'm a bisexual woman and grew up in the late 80s to early 90s, when 'gay' was used as a casual way to say something wasn't approved of.

This is ABSOLUTELY parenting done right. I love love love that you actually sat her down and explained it all to her.

It\u2019s the new peer pressure and it\u2019s BAD. Just look at the school shooter/bomb threat \u201cpranks\u201d. \n\nKids are so easily influenced. I fucking hate TikTok. And it\u2019s so toxic that maybe I\u2019m jaded but I cannot liken it to the way MySpace or Facebook hit its generation. The fact that Facebook actively posts the reals from TikTok really pisses me off. It makes me want to delete fb all together.", "This makes me warm inside.\n\n\nYou don't know it but this was definitely a pivotal moment in all of the girls lives.

I wouldn\u2019t have the level of restraint you had at all if I found out that my teenager and their friends made a tiktok about a family member calling them a slur. \n\nI\u2019d talk to the parents and get them to do community service projects every weekend for at least a month. Soup kitchens, clean up work, volunteering somewhere. \n\nThey have no clue how lucky they are that they get to create relationships with adults and what that will do for them in the future. There are decades of studies and my assumption is that she goes to a good school, has a good life, doesn\u2019t worry about not having enough, has parents, has friends, and will do fine in life. And yet she CHOSE to do this with her teammates. \n\nNot only that she disrespected someone who doesn\u2019t have to do any of those things for those girls. \n\nIt\u2019s honestly disgusting. I hope that they learned a valuable lesson from this experience, and that it changes their lives. Somehow I still have serious doubts. \n\nWhen these girls grow up, their boyfriends and husbands will likely cook anyway. Maybe they\u2019ll call them slurs as well.", "Fuckin wholesome update.

There are actually two professions here; chef and cook. Cooks tend to work in lower end facilities while chefs tend to work in high end facilities.

I\u2019m not a parent, but I can honestly say I think I would have reacted the way you did in the original post after you heard your daughter say such an awful thing on the phone, but I wouldn\u2019t have done anything else. Which is why it\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m not a parent, because nothing would have been learned if I had gone that route. \n\nYou taught your daughter and her teammates an invaluable lesson that they will likely carry with them for the rest of their lives.

The school needs to know because the horrific group-think needs to be exposed and dealt with on that level as well. A lot of permanent homophobic attitudes are learned from organized school sports.\n\nOne of the real issues here is that Bruce is not gay. Granted, he got singled out because of his interests by rather ignorant teenagers, but what they did is probably not the first or last time they will do this. They got 'embarrassed' by their parents, missed a single dance, got forced to spend time together doing project cooking, and some are even going to receive cooking lessons. Those girls did not suffer any real consequences for their actions. I cannot see how this will lead to any lasting change in their behavior since they wound up getting rewarded in the end.\n\nI'm sorry, and I know a lot of people will disagree, but the 'punishment' was not a punishment at all for bullying another human being.
