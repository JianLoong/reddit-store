Most of you agreed that I was NTA but many pointed out that the punishment did not fit the offense and was just meant to hurt. After thinking it over I agree.  \n\nI decided to sit Pam down and ask her why she had made the video. She kept saying she didn't know and crying. I explained how this could ruin her future, the bullying that people who are LGBTQ+ face and the consequences of said bullying, and how terrible it is that she would do this to someone who has treated her very well for as long as he's known her.  \n\nPam said that several members of the soccer team had used the f-slur to refer to Bruce after they saw how he was always baking and cooking for fun. She didn't like it but felt if she didn't agree, then she would be ostracized.  \n\nShe agreed to delete the video and apologized to Bruce for her actions. He accepted her apology.  \n\nMany people suggested that I make Pam and her friends cook for the next team dinner. Soccer season is over, so there are no team dinners until next year. However, Annie's gymnastic class had their family dinner/holiday party on the 16th, which happened to be the same night as the Holiday dance at the high school.  \n\nI contacted the parents of the girls who appeared in the video. A few asked to see the video, and all were deeply embarrassed and ashamed. I told them that we were willing to delete the video and would not refer it to the school as long as the girls apologized to Bruce, helped to prepare the food for the gymnastics dinner, and gave up the dance to volunteer at the party and serve meals. Every parent I spoke with was very grateful and agreed it was a fair consequence of their actions.  \n\nSo every day after school from Monday - Thursday the girls came over and worked in our kitchen, cutting up vegetables, boiling pasta, breading chicken, layering lasagna, making buttercream, mixing up cake batter, rolling out cookie dough, cutting cookies, washing dishes, and just about anything else we could find for them.  \n\nAt the end of Thursday, I asked the girls what part of what they did this week was gay. None of them had an answer. All of them approached Bruce at some point and apologized for being a part of the video.  \n\nAt the end of the party on Friday, two of the girls asked Bruce if he could teach them how to prepare a few of the meals he made for team dinners in the past, and he agreed. I realize not every girl who made fun of Bruce may have been in the video but a very clear message was sent. We have decided to still hold the sweet sixteen.  \n\nAfter sitting down with Marco, he explained he'd never heard anything said by the team before, didn't realize it was a team-wide issue, apologized for not having my back, and agreed that it was a fair punishment. He also promised if he heard any slurs from anyone, it would be the end of their time on the team.", "created_utc": 1672111511, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zw5brg/update_aita_for_canceling_my_daughters_16th/", "score": 10183, "replies": ["Wow.

They got 'embarrassed' by their parents, missed a single dance, got forced to spend time together doing project cooking, and some are even going to receive cooking lessons.

Some to the point of even ending their life\u2026 it\u2019s a serious matter. Not sure forcing girls to cook/bake is going to make them stop using such hateful, derogatory language. Any school worth a grain of salt would\u2019ve handled this. I may even be inclined to think suspension is appropriate, because this is bullying/harassment on social media.\n\nETA: thank you for the award kind stranger :)", "it gives more of a \u201ccooking is not gay \ud83d\ude20\u201d vibe than actually promoting that it\u2019s okay to be gay", "Low effort 1/10.", ">Half of regular line cooks look like they've shanked people in dark alleys just for being inconvenient.\n\nYou're not wrong.", "Same, I think it was 100 hours. And another 150 for graduating college.", "That is exactly what it is, work.  Parents had to get on-board with their part of the punishment and probably deal with some unhappy whining about the dance Yada Yada.\n\nMy son was harassed and actually followed (stalked) in 8th grade on their early out day; the kids all went to Starbucks or a tea shop after school since they were out 2 hours early.  A group of kids followed him and his friends (theater kids) and threw shit at them and physically intimidated them.  We went to the principal and informed him of our position, mine was that I would go to the sheriff have the kids arrested for stalking and harassment, file a civil harassment restraining order, and let the school deal with the fallout, stating that we both knew the likely lifetime outcome once a child is involved in the juvenile justice system.  My husband sat there and said, I've been to jail before and I'm not afraid to go back for defending my kid (stepkid).\n\nThe principal finally contacted the parents and these kids were no longer allowed to stay after school on early out days.", "There's fire and heat. It's a lot of physical work.", "Based on my understanding the word has been used in a perjorative slang way since the 1990s (which is when I was in school). I guess I believe the slang kids use sort of shifts and moves on through each generation. Kids don't really say \"da bomb\" or \"as if!\" anymore. Right? Right?!", "I dated a sous chef that use to work in Vegas. The amount of abuse he endured from head chefs there was ridiculous.

I understand if the 12-year-olds don't really think about the words they use and how they affect others. I totally get the allure of using \"forbidden\" words and all that. But when we've had those kids for three or four years, seen them grow and develop and talked to them A LOT about how our actions affect others, I get disappointed when the older kids still use those words.", "I think u/gavrielkay and u/ceddya together have illuminated the full absurdity of the situation. Ceddya was pointing out the ridiculousness of gender stereotypes and how they are usually very contradictory and inconsistent, depending on the context. Gavrielkay rightly points out the self-defeating nature of using ignorant/bigoted people's flawed logic to debunk their hurtful stereotypes \u2014 without careful wording and proper context, our attempts at breaking down harmful belief systems are capable of unintentionally reinforcing them instead.\n\nIdeas are often abstract shapes in darkness.

I can\u2019t imagine anyone in the world who wouldn\u2019t consider themselves incredibly lucky to have a Dad who cooks, bakes, makes music, and cares so much about what would make his kids happy. I think the girls who mocked Bruce are really just wildly jealous of your daughter. She has two Dads who are so very there for her in such a great range of ways. She is the kid equivalent of a billionaire. They don\u2019t want to mock Coach to his own kid because they want to be on the team, but they can use this cheap ugly mockery of Bruce to keep your daughter from enjoying the treasure she has in him. Please tell her this if you haven\u2019t already. And I think, if she feels up to it, your daughter should consider composing a little speech to read to the whole team, with Marco standing right by her side, about what she\u2019s learned from this situation. Not as a punishment, but as a way of standing up to bullies, stamping out bigotry, and becoming the hero of her own life. It will feel so good and I bet a lot of kids on the team will be so grateful to see that this kind of nonsense can be shut down by another kid.", "Thank you for the update. It sounds like you and the parents communicated well. I also appreciate that they got to see what it took for Bruce to prepare those meals. Kitchen work is no joke and people that are good at it make it look easy! I can't imagine how hard this was for you and your husband. Sending you some love.", "I don\u2019t have many words.

Thanks for the update.", "All I have to say is well done OP. You seem like a great parent and I'm glad this all worked out in a way that at least allowed a few young folks to grow up a bit without having to face any real, life-changing punishment.", "While I don\u2019t condone her actions, I can understand where the daughter is coming from. When I was 12 years old growing up in New Orleans, there was a deadly fire at a French Quarter gay bar, the deadliest fire in the city\u2019s history (and the deadliest crime against GLBT people until the Pulse Nightclub massacre). The fire wasn\u2019t a hate crime; it was a disgruntled patron who\u2019d been bounced earlier who had no idea the place was such a tinderbox. No, the hate crime was the city\u2019s response. The mayor wouldn\u2019t come home from vacation. Churches refused to bury the dead. The Archbishop didn\u2019t even send thoughts and prayers. Radio DJs told puerile jokes that got repeated on school playgrounds, and in my desperation to be accepted I may have laughed at some of them. (Full disclosure: I\u2019m gay.) It was even worse for a high school classmate who\u2014I learned decades later\u2014lost his father in that fire.\n\nPeer pressure can be a very powerful thing.", "Bruce seems like such a good guy \ud83d\udc97", "She still wouldn\u2019t get a party and I still wouldn\u2019t cook for them.

The number of people who genuinely want to do the evil thing is small and sometimes zero, but it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nYou get small-scale devilry like this, but you also get lynchings and genocides the same way.", "Kudos for the time you've committed to the character I guess.", "I am crying. This is such a great update. \n\nI am impressed with how you handled it, as well as the support from the other parents, Bruce, and Marco. \n\nYour daughter will remember this, her friends will, and hopefully they will all come out better from this lesson. \n\nEdit to add additional thought: I agree with another poster in that more needs to be done for your daughter and the rest of the team regarding the hateful speech and the anti-LGBTQ sentiments, as well as using peer pressure as an excuse. This is a good start, I believe you handled it well because missing the party would be a punishment,  but without the reflection.  Moving forward,  the entire group needs lessons on empathy and acceptance,  as well as doing what is right despite social pressure.", "I mean if you don't want your husband associated with Gay imagery maybe don't make his fake name Bruce when the first post mentions family guy lol", "My husband is a 6' tall welder and he's the one who bakes around here.

It's really bizarre and I don't get it.\n\nOh except Pastry Chefs or Bakers. The industry is okay with women having THOSE jobs because baking is apparently always feminine or some stupid shit.", "The 'traditional' roles at the moment are generally:\n\n* Women do the domestic baking and cooking, men cook for family barbecues and high-end restaurants.\n\n* Women do the cleaning and house care, but men mow the lawn every couple weeks and take out the garbage when it's full.\n\n* Women take care of the laundry, and should know how to sew so they can repair or modify clothes, but if a man wants a high-end suit made, he finds a prestigious male tailor.\n\n* Mothers spend time with their children and raise them at home, but fathers 'give away' their girls at weddings and take boys on fishing trips and such.\n\nAnd if you boil it down, it basically ends up as:\n\n* Women do the everyday, unseen, thankless chores.
