Most of you agreed that I was NTA but many pointed out that the punishment did not fit the offense and was just meant to hurt. After thinking it over I agree.  \n\nI decided to sit Pam down and ask her why she had made the video. She kept saying she didn't know and crying. I explained how this could ruin her future, the bullying that people who are LGBTQ+ face and the consequences of said bullying, and how terrible it is that she would do this to someone who has treated her very well for as long as he's known her.  \n\nPam said that several members of the soccer team had used the f-slur to refer to Bruce after they saw how he was always baking and cooking for fun. She didn't like it but felt if she didn't agree, then she would be ostracized.  \n\nShe agreed to delete the video and apologized to Bruce for her actions. He accepted her apology.  \n\nMany people suggested that I make Pam and her friends cook for the next team dinner. Soccer season is over, so there are no team dinners until next year. However, Annie's gymnastic class had their family dinner/holiday party on the 16th, which happened to be the same night as the Holiday dance at the high school.  \n\nI contacted the parents of the girls who appeared in the video. A few asked to see the video, and all were deeply embarrassed and ashamed. I told them that we were willing to delete the video and would not refer it to the school as long as the girls apologized to Bruce, helped to prepare the food for the gymnastics dinner, and gave up the dance to volunteer at the party and serve meals. Every parent I spoke with was very grateful and agreed it was a fair consequence of their actions.  \n\nSo every day after school from Monday - Thursday the girls came over and worked in our kitchen, cutting up vegetables, boiling pasta, breading chicken, layering lasagna, making buttercream, mixing up cake batter, rolling out cookie dough, cutting cookies, washing dishes, and just about anything else we could find for them.  \n\nAt the end of Thursday, I asked the girls what part of what they did this week was gay. None of them had an answer. All of them approached Bruce at some point and apologized for being a part of the video.  \n\nAt the end of the party on Friday, two of the girls asked Bruce if he could teach them how to prepare a few of the meals he made for team dinners in the past, and he agreed. I realize not every girl who made fun of Bruce may have been in the video but a very clear message was sent. We have decided to still hold the sweet sixteen.  \n\nAfter sitting down with Marco, he explained he'd never heard anything said by the team before, didn't realize it was a team-wide issue, apologized for not having my back, and agreed that it was a fair punishment. He also promised if he heard any slurs from anyone, it would be the end of their time on the team.", "created_utc": 1672111511, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zw5brg/update_aita_for_canceling_my_daughters_16th/", "score": 662, "replies": ["Wow. This is a great update!\n\nSeems like all the parents got onboard to show silly teenagers that their words hurt. \n\nTeenagers do lots of dumb stuff because they are dumb and testing all the boundaries in life. \n\nHaving all the adults onboard to basically band together and explain how this language is hurtful and that is not Ok is the absolute best result. \n\nThese type of conversations along with working with the person they were being hurtful to will go a long way into making them empathetic adults who understand why you don\u2019t do things rather than a simple punishment!\n\nGood parenting", "You're a really good mom. I'm not sure what I would have done.", "Thank you OP!!!!! This is A+ parenting. When I see posts like this it reminds me of that quote from greys anatomy \u201cthe world changes by good people raising their babies right\u201d", "Wholesome update, great parenting, hopefully everyone learned a valuable lesson.  10/10", "Its tough to realize that you went overboard and to back off on a punishment, so you should be proud that you were able to do that. I think the best part is that the punishment may have started off as one, but I bet all of those girls are going to remember cooking with their friends as a positive experience, even if they missed the dance. They learned their lesson about all of it but everyone comes out ahead.", "I missed your initial edits and I\u2019m really glad to see this update. I wish more people parented like you these days", "Great parenting. I'm so glad all the parents supported their kids consequences. Hopefully, this has taught them all a good lesson.", "Nice update.  As a 6'2\" 200+ lb biker who teaches martial arts....I have to say I love to bake.  Not sure why people equate cooking/baking as feminine in the modern age.", "Beautiful resolution. \n\nPutting them on the job, and making them see how hard he works for them, is a perfect way to deal with this.", "Perfect way to handle everything in this situation. Way to go!", "A proper life lesson that can change the world, one person at a time. Well done.", "\"I asked the girls what part of what they did this week was gay.\"  \nI love this", "Wonderful!  I'm glad you realized the punishment didn't fit the time and then pushed for more information.  \n\n\nKnowing teenage life (and, sadly, sometimes adult life), kids often feel pushed to do negative things because someone else starts it.  It's very hard to be the one standing up, so I don't blame her for not.  Girls are especially good at emotional hurting.  \n\n\nExcellent overall solution.", "I wish we had more updates like this. I really hope your daughter and her friends learned from their mistakes and realized that their words and actions have consequences. Life gets a lot more serious when you're caught bullying outside of the protection of school and extra curriculars. Something like that as an adult could have cost them all their jobs, school scholarships or even admission, and so much more. I hope that you took the time to go over some of those consequences too. Seems to be a lot of TikToking happening just for clout these days.", "Best update I have ever seen! You are a great Mum, and hearing how the other parents had your back made me tear up!\n\nI'm a bisexual woman and grew up in the late 80s to early 90s, when 'gay' was used as a casual way to say something wasn't approved of. I've had that f-word thrown at me, too, despite being female. The way you handled this was wonderful, rather than simple punishment you gave the girls an opportunity to learn.\n\nI hope I can be your type of parent as my daughter grows up!", "yea you are bro", "I love this update. This is ABSOLUTELY parenting done right. I love love love that you actually sat her down and explained it all to her. It's also wonderful that she felt comfortable enough to actually open up to you about why she was doing this. You and the other parents, amazing job on the punishment. You rock and if I had any awards to give you I would so take my lame emojis lol \ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc6\ud83e\udd47", "Cooking is weird in this way because it's only considered feminine if you're not getting paid to do it, like 90% of high end chefs and celebrity chefs you see are guys and no one calls them feminine.", "My brother is a former Marine and current cop of over 20 years. He makes a killer lemon meringue pie, and does most of the cooking in his house.", "I interned at a country club kitchen. High end establishment, I was one of four women on the kitchen staff. My executive chef was a misogynistic piece of work, and refused to accept any advice or ideas from any on the women on the team. But God forbid a man cooks at home \ud83e\udd74", "Nice to see grown ups being grown ups. Doesn\u2019t often happen in this sub", "Saying slurs = testing all the boundaries in life? You\u2019re wild for that one.", "I\u2019m pretty sure they meant that teens typically test the waters to see what they can(t) get away with. No, it wasn\u2019t okay to call the boy slurs to test those waters, but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what the commenter is saying."]}
