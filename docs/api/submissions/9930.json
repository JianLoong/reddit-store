While the adjustment was hard at first Reina is a great kid and we are extremely proud of her. She's (too) smart, kind, gets along great with my other children. I would say its gone as well as it possibly could.\n\nThe issue is, Reina recently talked to my wife about adoption. Apparently she wanted some advice before she asked me to adopt her on her birthday. Obviously Sarah brought it up with me privately afterwards. However I don't think it would be appropriate. We have the same parents, I know they loved her. Our parents were amazing, and I've tried to tell Reina about them and keep some connection. I love Reina, but I'm her brother, not her father. It wouldn't be right to do this. Sarah did not take it well. She took it the worst way possible and was basically disgusted. She thinks that I have no right to refuse Reina at this point, and thinks it's selfish and cruel for me to 'choose your dead parents' over Reina. \n\nI think she's being unfair. I still love Reina, and as her brother and guardian I do treat her the same as my other children. I just don't think adoption is appropriate. But Sarah is acting like I'm heartless and says I have no choice but to do it and like it. I can't help but feel it would be a mistake to allow it, but Sarah is insisting that I'm being a complete asshole.", "created_utc": 1676382798, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1125w3y/aita_not_wanting_to_adopt_my_sister/", "score": 485, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn\u2019t have to diminish your father in any way. Your sister is telling you something about how she views you and her new family.  She can still hold her old family dear as well. You\u2019re not an asshole for having the feelings you do, but do try to consider this from your sisters perspective, and try to understand that the way you are thinking about this may not be the only reality. NAH.", "INFO:\n\nWhy do you see adoption as \u201creplacing\u201d your parents? I\u2019m not trying to be glib, I genuinely don\u2019t understand how adopting Reina has anything to do with her memories of her birth parents. She knows you\u2019re her brother and that her parents have passed.\n\nYou seem to be functioning as her father anyway, I don\u2019t understand how making that \u201cofficial\u201d will change anything.", "NAH, but you will be when you tell her you aren\u2019t adopting her. Shove your internal conflict aside. Your parents would want you to bring their daughter up in the healthiest way possible, not honor them by withholding the mom and dad that actually raised her. This is hard for you because you loved your parents, but this has nothing to do with what they would have wanted. Also your wife clearly wants to adopt her. Also, you\u2019re about to mess up your relationship with her long term.", "OP, my mom passed away when I was a sophomore in high school and I had to be a parent to my younger sister because dad had to work 80 hours a week to make ends meet with the medical debt. \n\nI completely see where you are coming from. Have you taken the time to speak with a counselor about how you're processing your grief? I'm now 30 and I'm still finding behaviors or opinions stemming from losing my mom. I genuinely think it would benefit you to speak to someone about this specific situation even if you've done counseling in the past. \n\nIf nothing else, be up front with your sister and tell her how you feel and reaffirm your love for her and her place in your life. Best of luck.\n\nEdit: NAH", "NAH, but you should really think about the fact that your sister was orphaned when she was too young to remember. She has likely always felt like an \u201coutsider\u201d, and having a piece of paper saying you\u2019re her parents would be incredibly meaningful to say she belongs. \n\nYou see her as your sister and remember your parents, but she doesn\u2019t remember that family. She wants to belong, and you should do it for her.", "INFO: are you attempting to have a sibling- like relationship? \n\nI understand that you are her guardian and there is a 22 year age gap but I would think you should be treating her uniquely to your own children as you have a sibling relationship. \n\nIf that age gap was smaller say 25 (&with kids) and 16 you certainly wouldn't be the AH because the sibling relationship would be prominent.", "INFO: Do you think your parents would have been more concerned about being replaced to some extent in her eyes, or making sure she has a sense of family who love her?", "NAH - I understand why you are hesitant. You grew up with your parents. Your sister didn\u2019t. She sees you as her parent. Both of your feelings are valid. This isn\u2019t an AH situation. This is an opportunity to talk. Your sister needs to feel like she is a part of your family.", "NAH. \n\nI understand how you feel. You don\u2019t want to replace your parents. BUT, how does your wife feel? She raised this child for nine years since she was four.\n\nFour years old is so young. All your sister wants is a mom and dad. Don\u2019t dismiss that because you can clearly remember yours, and she can\u2019t. \n\nTalk to your wife about your parents and your feelings.", "Consider this,  you adopting Reina gives her security that she can't be removed from your home. If God forbid something happens to you does your wife have authority to keep Reina or is there a chance she would go into the system?  She's already lost her family once, there's probably a lot of fear of it happening again.  If you and your wife adopt her and something happens to you, Reina has the security of knowing she can stay with your wife. You aren't replacing your parents, your giving your sister the security of a permanent home if the worst happens again.", "This one is hard. I was adopted by my grandmother when I was 13. I was raised by my grandparents since I was a baby. I knew they were my grandparents, and I knew my mother, but really, thought of her as my older sister most of my childhood. She wasn't able to raise a child at that time. \n\nYour sister looks to you as her father, and your wife as her mother, and your children as her siblings. As a family unit, she is the one standing out, the one that is different. And she now wants to be included fully. Adoption is very much appropriate in this situation. It doesn't make your relationship with her any less or any more. She knows you are her brother and her guardian. She wants to be included in your family unit. Don't reject her. I don't think that YTA, but you need to be more open.", "NTA.  But are there other options?\n\nBack before same-sex marriages were legal, many couples had commitment ceremonies.  Could you do something similar to that?  Make a big deal of it, but leave the legal adoption aside?  Think through some different options before Reina approaches you.\n\nThen, when she does, ask her - what does she want out of adoption?  Is it security? Is it an expression of love/respect? \n\nDon't say \"no\" \\*, but talk about your concerns.  How you love your parents, they loved her, your concerns about her forgetting them or not getting a change to really know them, etc.  Talk through the pros and cons with her and decide how you move forward in a way that works for both of you (and Sarah).  \n\n\\*Now that Sarah warned you, you can honestly tell Reina that you have \"thought about it\" without telling her it was as a result of her bringing it up to Sarah.  That, I think will go a long way in reassuring her that you love her and think about her as a daughter, and your concerns have been given a lot of thought.", "INFO: are there any benefits to Reina in being legally adopted as opposed to just you and your wife being her legal guardians? \n\nAs of right now I\u2019m leaning towards NAH. I do not think legally adopting her means you have to take on a \u201cfather\u201d role in any way. You could still treat her like your sister. I\u2019m just wondering if maybe certain things would be easier if she was legally adopted by you.", "NAH - the factor not being discussed here is how you\u2019re processing your own parents\u2019 departure. You\u2019re not exactly speaking to it, but it\u2019s clear by how you call it \u201cinappropriate\u201d and emphasize how great your parents were that this major loss is something you might understandably still be grappling with. I\u2019m sure they were great, by the way :) So, i\u2019d wager that accepting this role would feel like you\u2019re replacing your parents in ways you\u2019re not comfortable with. I think that\u2019s fair. It\u2019s ultimately up to you, not Sarah, despite her good intentions. But i think you need to have an honest heart to heart with Reina, and tell her how you truly feel. It\u2019s important she hears whether or not you call yourself her brother or her father, that it doesn\u2019t change how much you love and care for her. Feelings may shift in the future and it might be something you\u2019re more open to. For now, it sounds like you\u2019re not, so just be honest and sincere.", "There was a post quite similar to this recently, and a comment on that post really stuck with me: you\u2019re so concentrated on honoring someone who is no longer here, that you forgot to honor the person right in front of you (paraphrased). You have no way of knowing what your parents would think of this situation (though I have a hard time believing they would be against the adoption), but in either case they are no longer here. On the other hand, your little sister is actively interested in you adopting her. This isn\u2019t some trivial whim. What would it mean to her if you declined? If you don\u2019t think she will view this as an absolute rejection you are beyond na\u00efve. Stop thinking of the past, look in front of you.", "Gently, **YTA**\n\nI hear what you're saying, and I understand why you're saying it. Your parents were everything to you, truly wonderful parents whom you grieve the loss of (and I promise you, Reina does as well), and the idea of \"erasing\" them as parents from Reina's life and mind feels like a betrayal to you. And you are NOT an AH for that part of this. You are a loving son.\n\nBut you got to experience a childhood with your parents. You got to HAVE the full experience of being parented by them until you were ready to go out into the world as an adult. That is the beautiful legacy they left you, raising you to be a good man so that you could now take care of Reina when they are gone.\n\nReina doesn't get to have that. And in a sense you are right. You shouldn't ever replace them, and you won't. Even if you and Sarah adopt her and become her legal parents, you should always, always tell her about your shared parents, how much they loved her, what kind of parents they were, how proud they would have been of her, etc. Make them a part of her heart and her every day. Make them real to her as much as you can. BUT . . .\n\n**Reina is telling you what SHE needs to have the kind of healthy, happy childhood that your parents gave you**. She is begging you for it. She doesn't just need you to love her as her big brother or \"treat her the same as \\[your\\] other children. She needs to feel like she has a father and mother *right here, right now*. That doesn't erase that she *also* has a father and mother who loved her endlessly and died, who you will keep alive in her memory. But she needs *another set of parents* now, you and Sarah, to be PRESENT in her life, to give her the childhood that your parents gave you, that only you can give her. Not as her brother, but as her dad. \n\nI promise you, I know it hurts your heart but you are NOT dishonouring your parents by doing this. You are HONOURING them, and the way they raised you. They would be so, so proud of you for giving your sister what they are not here to give her. Please, as difficult as it is, do this for her and for them. Make it official. Be her dad. And then, as her father, tell her about her OTHER mother and father, the ones you shared. I promise you won't regret it.\n\nSending you all so much love and strength. YTA right now, but only because you are struggling. You can still turn this around.", "YTA his comments display little to no emotional intelligence. It\u2019s coming off as \u2018No I won\u2019t adopt her because I miss our dad\u2019 so now she doesn\u2019t get a father figure at all?\nAnd his insistence that \u2018she\u2019s my sister we\u2019ll always have a bond\u2019 is tone deaf. That is not guaranteed. If you reject her she may shut you off, cut contact when she can because she knows where she\u2019s not wanted.\nA lot of people pointing out that \u2018legally\u2019 he doesn\u2019t have to. Yeah obviously. This isn\u2019t a legal sub, it\u2019s a morality question, and morally? YTA", "NAH, I understand where you are coming from, BUT I would encourage you to be open-minded. Have a discussion with Reina on why she wants to be adopted and go from there.", "Is Reina in therapy to help deal with the loss of her parents?  If so, I would suggest this be a therapy subject and maybe help dig deeper to find out why she wants you to adopt her.", "Info\u2014 does your sister receive benefits from the government (social security or health care )? Would there be any legal ramifications to the adoption?", "I feel like this is a very difficult emotion to navigate. Obviously you love and care for your sister and had amazing parents who did everything for the both of you. It sounds like they were wonderful people. I bet it\u2019s hard to see her grow up and feel like she\u2019s missing out on them. You are essentially her parent though. She obviously wants a more \u201cpermanent\u201d or \u201ccloser\u201d connection to you and your family and for her that feels like adoption. I don\u2019t think your reasonings are necessarily wrong but I wouldn\u2019t phrase it how you did here. I agree with a lot of the other commenters that therapy would be a good choice for you and her. Counselors can help with tricky situations like this where neither party can feel rejected. If you refuse to adopt your sister that will hurt her, even if you have good reasons, she also has good reasons for wanting to be adopted.  If therapy is not an option I would say talk to her about the situation gently and honestly. \u201cSarah told me you were thinking about being adopted by us, tell me more about it\u2026 how are you feeling\u2026 what reasons\u2026 I hear you\u2026 Let me think about this for a while because it\u2019s a very serious matter/decision and I care about you and want to make the best choice for both of us\u2026 love you etc\u2026\u201d and then you as the adult look into what adoption could do for the situation of everyone involved. LOOK INTO IT AND DO RESEARCH. Your answer might change or it might stay the same but at least you can be informed and can give your sis assurance that you\u2019re taking her feelings and concerns seriously too. Whatever decision you come to I hope for the best for you and your family. NAH.", "YTA.... You've been the one to raise her all this time. If this is what she wants, I don't see the issue. Your parents would understand that you're not trying to replace their them or disrespect their memory. She's lost them and I think if you denied her this request, she would feel like she lost you too. If it's the title of father that bothers you, tell her that it might take you some time to get used to it, but to be patient with you.", "If Reina gets married would you refuse to walk her down the aisle because your not her dad? Your relationship has already been irrevocably altered. You might not be her \u201creal\u201d dad, but you\u2019re obviously more than just a brother to her. Since she\u2019s the child you should put her feelings before your own. You\u2019re only going to hurt a girl whose already gone through enough.", "Sounds like she is asking for permanence. Probably getting to the age where she is realizing/processing the passing of her parents in a different way. And while you have a whole life you remember of your parents I bet she has little to none. She just wants the finality of adoption . NTA, but I really encourage you to reconsider and offer her the permanence she is craving . She\u2019s a kid so she isn\u2019t going to ever see the situation in the way you are describing. She knows you\u2019re her brother", "INFO: Does she actually remember your parents? \n\nI can imagine that those memories are really hazy for her and if that's the case, you and your wife are the only parents she's ever known. \n\nIf it means this much to her to help her feel like she's truly part of your family and that she belongs somewhere would it be such a hardship to give this to her? \n\nI get your feelings on it as you were a grown adult when you lost them but they are gone. Denying her this doesn't actually benefit your parents because they're sadly not here anymore, but it sounds like it would make a hugely positive impact on her mental health and well-being. \n\nI suppose the question here is what's more important in the long run?", "NAH....\n\nThis is a bit of a doozy. Your her brother and you don't want to be a replacement for the parents she lost...

Not saying you won't but these are understandable doubts for a teen. \nEspecially if you had children after you took her in... She can see tha perminent nature of that bond and thinks she's missing out.\n\nYour wife didn't handle your choice well... But you need to talk it out and get on the same page.

Odds are your parents would have been happy that you and your wife became the parents that your sister needed.", "I think the YTA comments here are quick to judge. Yes of course what many said is likely correct - she wants a better connection to the nuclear family. You're feeling that this erases the nuclear family you once had with your parents? That you lose a sister and gain a daughter? Perhaps, while you are her guardian anyway, you don't want the brother sister dynamic to be erased with her? I don't know about any legal issues but are these the issues running through your head? 1. It doesn't erase the family that was. Adopting her will cement it. The one concern every parent has after their days is that their kids are well taken care of and belong. She will be daughter in name only but is still your sister. 2. If you reject her now, as a 13 year old girl she will feel like she doesn't belong anywhere and that's a very dangerous place to be. 3. Seek legal advice - I get that you don't just want to make an emotional decision - do it properly. Get it done mate don't let her feel as if this is something you're being forced into.", "Have you, your wife and Reina had any family therapy? This might be helpful, plus individual counselling for yourself to help work out your feelings towards this decision before coming to Reina with an answer.", "I really wanted to go Y T A but the more I thought about it, I have to vote NAH.  However, the thought of Reina taking this huge step of asking you to adopt her, then being rejected, is absolutely heartbreaking and I really think that will stay with her for the rest of her life.  OP, I wonder what your parents would want if they could communicate that to you?  Don't you think they would want your sister to not suffer this second trauma in her life?  I don't know them, but just wonder if you have asked yourself this.  I hope this all works out for the best for everyone involved.\n\nEdit:  put spaces in my Y T A", "No asshole here BUT...\n\nConsider this, you lost your parents as an adult, where she lost hers as a very young child. What you have now is a young person at about the most vulnerable age there is, who is reaching out for some support and belonging that she obviously strongly feels she needs.\n\nYour logic and reasoning as to why you wouldn't want to do that are impeccable, but these are emotional tides, matters of the heart - they aren't subject to logic and reasoning. Put everything else aside for a moment and ask yourself what your sister needs right now.

But to Reina, they are barely a memory and you and your wife are her parents. \n\nI get that for you it feels like replacing your parents and that is a whole new layer of grief.

It might sort out everyone's feelings and concerns.", "Sounds like OP is stuck on it meaning his is father to his sister. He thinks the title is weird and he's worried he'sreplacing his actual dad (which is farther from the truth). Like let that go it's more important that your sister has told your wife she feels safe and secure with the both of you. If that ain't special, I dont know what is.. You're the only father figure she grew up with. Adopt her. It's what she wants the most. It means something to her and of you dont see how important that is, title aside, then you will be pushing her away for a long time.", "Awwww Man, I see what you're saying but I can't help thinking that she clearly looks at you guys as her parents.She's looking for stability and so she can be like her friends and say 'mom or dad' \nI can't really say that YTA as it's a tough position. \nI personally think it's a real shame as she loves you both like parents.\nall the best and I hope it all works out", "~~NAH.~~ Edit: **YTA**\n\nYou're the only parent Reina knows and with that age gap, its not shocking that she sees you more as a father figure rather than her brother. Clearly she is feeling like she wants some kind of legal recognition of you being her parent, not just her guardian. Therefore, she is not an AH. \n\nAnd to you, she's your baby sister, you love her as someone you've seen grow and have raised for the large majority of her life. I'm sure it would feel weird to step in as a formally identified parent because it would feel like perhaps erasing your parents as well. Therefore, you are not an AH. \n\nAnd while Sarah was harsh, she is watching a child she considers a daughter struggling and wanting a firmer place in your life, which doesn't make her an AH. \n\nI think the best thing here really is two things. \n\n1) Family therapy. Reina is old enough that she understands how complex her situation is but is still feeling on the outs. Therapy might be a good place to allow her to express herself and for you to respond in kind. Chances are Reina *is* going to see this as a rejection of sorts and you need to mitigate that. \n\n2) Be honest but gentle with how you're feeling when you tell Reina. You lost your parents tragically, but you got 25 years with them. You knew them as an adult. She only really has one set of parents and that is you and Sarah. For as much as you don't want to replace your parents you need to recognise that a situation beyond your control *has* made it so that you replace them. You are her brother but you are also her Dad. Don't allow this little girl to feel rejected.\n\n**Edit to add: I'm changing my answer to YTA because of OP's responses. OP, all I'm reading from you is \"me, me, me\" and I get it, you have complicated mixed up feelings in all of this. But nowhere in this post do I read you take a moment to reflect on why a 13 year old kid, who lost her bio parents, would want to formalize a relationship with the only parents she has had for the past 9 years. Nowhere do I read you take a step back to consider why she wants this and I suspect this is where Sarah called you an AH because you are not taking the moment to look at the girl you raised and understand why she wants to be formally recognised as your child, something that she clearly feels she is.** \n\n**You both need some therapy here. You need to realise that being a Dad to Reina does not take away the role your own Dad and Mum had. And she needs to understand that your struggle to formalize does not have anything to do with her.**\n\n**A sister** *is* **important, it** *is* **a permanent position in someone's life but she clearly needs more security and you need to understand why that is.**", "Your sister lost her parents when she was 4. You and your wife are the only parental figures she has in her life. I\u2019m sure for the past 9 years you have been actively keeping your parents\u2019 memories alive in her and she will not forget them. While your children are technically her nieces/nephews they are more like siblings to her. \n\nI\u2019m not going to call you an AH because I don\u2019t believe you are doing this maliciously, but stop to think about Reina. 13 is a tough age, especially for girls. She is going through a lot and she doesn\u2019t have her mother here to help her. If you and your wife adopt her, she will have that comfort and support that she needs. Puberty, boys, school dances, prom, graduation, etc. I\u2019m sure it will be much easier for her to navigate these things feeling like she has loving parents helping her along the way. \n\nAnd if you tell her no after she mustered up the courage to ask, you can be assured that she will be heart broken and feel alone. Please reconsider.", "Soft YTA. This is a tough one. I see where you are coming from. You're her brother, and you don't want to replace your dad. But, it seems like your sister is missing having actual parents with the title and all. Have you thought about therapy for your family? It might help settle this situation.\n\nAlso, there are alternatives to adoption.  Have you heard about symbolic adoption? It's used sometimes in therapy (for example, adults who had bad parents can be symbolically adopted by parents of their choosing later in life). \n\nWhile adoption is a great option, there are some downsides. If you are receiving federal/ local aid for caring for your sister, that would likely cease if you adopt her. In the US, some states will pay for college for kids in custodial arrangements, but if you adopt your sister, they won't pay for college.\n\nFinally, I say soft YTA because while you're a very good brother, you don't seem to see the situation from your sisters perspective. You're likely the only parents she remembers, and she doesn't want to be treated differently from your other children. Put yourself in her shoes for a bit. Best of luck!", "I recently saw something that resonated with me.  In short, we should forget about trying to make our ancestors proud and focus on making sure we can be someone our children will be proud of.  \n\nI think this applies here.  Your parents are gone, and you are now in their place.  It is your decision and you should adopt your sister.

Reina is likely saying something through this request, I\u2019m assuming bc obviously I\u2019m filling in my own gaps but maybe she saying;\n\n-I recognize you as a caretaker, more than a brother but less than a father.

Grief is not \u2018oh I lost them, I\u2019m sad, time goes by and I\u2019m fine\u2019\u2026no it\u2019s years of acceptance and then one morning for no reason you wake up in a flood of tears like it just happened right then. \n\n-Maybe she sees your kids and identifies w them and yearns to be more like them in the respect that adoption would give her a sense of self. \n\nI think you get the point, there\u2019s only one way to know, talk to her. I do think though in an effort to protect her heart and so she doesn\u2019t misunderstand you as \u201cnot wanting her\u201d that perhaps a grief specialist could help you both thru this conversation. Maybe at the end of it you might find that you feel adoption is a great step and you feel better about it.

She wants what she already feels in her heart to be legal and on paper.   \n\n\nI am sorry that she will not know your parents like you did, and that she won't remember them the same way, regardless of how much you teach her. But she just won't. She isn't old enough. It's like how my generation gets mad at Gen Z for not being properly reverential of the 9/11 attacks. They weren't there.

Don't let the linear nature of time destroy something as good as what you have with Reina.\n\nShe loves you, and wants you to be the parent you already are to her.

Losing them so young was probably very traumatic for her and having her second father figure reject her is a recipe for abandonment issues. She probably has few memories of your parents, and you the only father she has really known, will be telling her that she is unwanted.

Curious what they think.", "YTA - And your reasoning sucks, she does not and never will have the same connection to your biological parents as you do because you had over twenty years before they died to form connections with them.

I get you want to stay her brother and adoption will not change that. My father and his wife legally adopted her granddaughter, they're still grandma and grandpa. A legal adoption made her my little sister and gave her more legal protection, her crappy mom is still alive and horrible but she has no legal rights to her or her college fund. I would do the adoption, it will make your sister feel more like a part of your family and not the odd man out.", "Soft YTA\n\nFrom what you are saying, to you, adopting her would feel like replacing your dead parents, and erasing the memory of how much they loved your sister and you. It would be painful. It would mean stepping away from how you've seen yourself: as a brother and sister who have survived the terrible tragic loss of your parents. \n\nTo Reina, being adopted by you would mean something different, something really important, that probably means being secure, feeling like she belongs, honoring you. You'd have to ask her to find out. At any rate, when a teen makes a bold move towards trying to connect with the adults in their life, it's a rare and precious thing, and a moment of extreme emotional vulnerability for that teen. Mess this up, and it could mess Reina up for years. \n\nYou both have strong emotional needs. Those need to be explored and honored. I think Reina deserves the opportunity to have this honest and painful conversation and for you to come to the conversation from a place of vulnerability and openness and respectful listening. If you can set aside your defensive feelings (\"of course I love her as much as the others\" and \"this is a mistake\"), and LISTEN to her, that is the right thing to do.  \n\nI think you need to really consider the teen's needs very strongly. I think you need to take the time to really examine your own motivations and to process your own grief. Dismissing her request out of hand is not okay. Maybe you aren't emotionally ready to do the adoption now. Maybe this birthday deadline is just too much, too fast for you. That's fine. But she deserves for you to take her request seriously and for you to be honest and open with her about why it makes you so sad to contemplate adoption. Then you need to do the emotional work to find a way to meet her emotional needs as well as finding a way for you to feel like you are honoring your shared parents.", "So you need your sister to remain parentless?\n\nAsshole.

In your own words, you repeatedly refer to her and \"your other children\". You recognize her as one of your children. You are her parents. Adoptees, especially orphans, are capable of recognizing more than one set of parents in their life. She is not asking you to pretend your parents didn't exist, didn't want her, or didn't love her. She ks asking for acknowledgement that your parental bond with her exists too, that you want her as much as they did, and you love her not just as a brother but as a parent. You can fill both roles. You already have. Formalizing it on paper doesn't make your parents any less real or important. It just gives her stability, reassurance, and permanency. As an adult who has those things from a spouse, I don't think you are appreciating how much more alone in the world your sister must feel without anyone who is permanently sworn to commit to ushering her through this world. Even if you have legal guardianship over her, it's not the same as the stability your other children have of being guaranteed a lifetime of being parented. You age out of guardianship. You don't age out of being adopted. She's telling you she needs formalization of the existing parental relationship that you already have. Please consider what it would do to her if you refuse.

You've raised her since she was 4 years old. You are basically the only parent that she knows and remembers. Your parents will still be her parents if you adopt her. This isn't taking away that fact. You obviously treat her as one of your own if she is the one wanting to come to you for this. Maybe she just wants to feel closer to you, feel more like one or you own, or even so she doesn't have to explain her situation to others anymore. Maybe she needs that connection of \"truly having a parent\" that is able to be physically with her.

She's not asking for a kidney or the keys to your car. And, it's not about YOU! Suck it up. YTA!", "YTA. My parents both died when I was a teenager. (But legally an adult. Dad died when I was 18, mom when I was 19.) My brother is only 2 years younger than me so we've always just had a sibling relationship. However, I went through a rough patch in my early 20s and my mom's sister and bil really stepped in and did the most to help me get back on track. Then when I got pregnant with my oldest child at 23, they took me out to dinner and asked if they could be her grandparents. I was touched, but hesitant. They have 2 grown kids of their own and have a bunch of bio grandkids and I didn't want to step on toes. I expressed this to them and a week or so later, we had a second dinner with my cousins and they asked me to officially become part of their family. My cousins welcomed me into a sibling role and as an auntie to their children and my aunt and uncle offered to not only take on a grandparent role with my kids, but told me they already considered me one of their kids and wanted to \"make it official.\" Nobody was trying to replace my parents, just fill in the vacant roles, ya know? When I was 25, they \"adopted\" me. I was already a legal adult, but (at least in my state adult adoption is a thing) we went to the local courthouse and we all signed paperwork and on paper, I'm now legally recognized as their child just as much as their own kids. It doesn't change much aside from things like if I'm in the hospital unable to make decisions for myself, they can jump in as next of kin or when they both die one day their estate will be divided between myself and their bio kids. Stuff like that. But I cannot describe the feeling of knowing you're wanted. Of being a part of their immediate family by choice, not just part of their extended family. It was something I didn't know I needed until I had it. I still tear up a bit when I'm at the store or something with my uncle and he runs into an old coworker and introduces me as his daughter. I don't call them \"mom and dad,\" just \"aunt (name) and uncle (name)\" like I always have. But they're grandma and grandpa to my kids and that's the part that brings me the most joy. As a mother, it means SO much to me that my kids have grandparents who genuinely and authentically love them and treat them as their own. I'm sure your parents wouldn't take it as a jab if you *really* took on the parental role of your sister, you're already doing that.\n\nAt this point, it's not for you and it's not about your parents. It's for your sister. It's about making your sister feel less like an orphan you took in out of obligation and more like a real, important, crucial part of your family. She doesn't have to start calling you and your wife mom and dad. But it will do wonders for her mental health to know that, 100% without a doubt you love her and will always be there to care for her and she IS part of your family. \n\nAs it is, you've already raised her. The two of you will never have a typical sibling relationship and she will always see you as a parental figure or mentor more than just her brother. She wants this. Your wife wants this. Your own children already see her as a sibling more than an aunt. If she approaches you with this and you reject her, you'll cause irreparable damage to your relationship with her, her relationships with the rest of your family and the way she views herself. \n\nI've still not seen you elaborate on why exactly you don't think it's appropriate. If it's about you honoring your parents feelings, respectfully, they don't have feelings anymore and will never know about it. But I can almost guarantee that theu would be on board with you adopting her. Most parents would want their young children to feel part of a family and have genuine parental figures after they've passed. I know I would want my own kids to have that if I die while they're still young.

While the adjustment was hard at first Reina is a great kid and we are extremely proud of her. She's (too) smart, kind, gets along great with my other children. I would say its gone as well as it possibly could.\n\nThe issue is, Reina recently talked to my wife about adoption. Apparently she wanted some advice before she asked me to adopt her on her birthday. Obviously Sarah brought it up with me privately afterwards. However I don't think it would be appropriate. We have the same parents, I know they loved her. Our parents were amazing, and I've tried to tell Reina about them and keep some connection. I love Reina, but I'm her brother, not her father. It wouldn't be right to do this. Sarah did not take it well. She took it the worst way possible and was basically disgusted. She thinks that I have no right to refuse Reina at this point, and thinks it's selfish and cruel for me to 'choose your dead parents' over Reina. \n\nI think she's being unfair. I still love Reina, and as her brother and guardian I do treat her the same as my other children. I just don't think adoption is appropriate. But Sarah is acting like I'm heartless and says I have no choice but to do it and like it. I can't help but feel it would be a mistake to allow it, but Sarah is insisting that I'm being a complete asshole.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It somehow seems like you think it is wrong going from being her brother to adopting her to become her adopted father.  It is not. It is the kindest and most loving thing you can do. If you haven't seemed out therapy to sort out how you feel I would do that before choosing to say no to her. \n\nNow for your sister. In her eyes, you are her brother and her father. The person who has raised her. You are more a father to her than a brother. (Where in your eyes you see her as your sister only)...  You are everything a father does. Just biologically you are her brother. She wants to feel like your daughters are her sisters. Cause they essentially are just not by title. And she wants the title. To fully feel part of the family. If you tell her no all she will feel and hear is he doesn't love me as much as them, I lost my bio parent, and the only other parent I thought I had doesn't want to be my dad.

Your parents are dead, and if they were the good parents you claim they would WANT her to be happy.", "I don't think you should be calling the child \"unfair.\"  She just wants to make her connection with you official in the way she sees it.\n\nIf you don't want to do it, that's fine, but you should definitely treat her with kindness and explain your reasoning.  She may get upset and I'd encourage you to maintain your cool and work through it.  \n\nThe problem is that you've also been raising her, so it's kind of hard to say \"hey Lil sis, now we're siblings, forget about all the parental stuff I've been doing during your formative years.\"", "The adoptee is the requesting the adoption here, so clearly she is not advocating for permanent guardianship.", "I think you need to get into therapy. You\u2019re obsessed with the idea that you\u2019re replacing your dad and that is not at all what\u2019s happening. Your sister just wants to belong.", "This is the BIGGEST situation of all.  You are not willing to commit to her.  You can tell yourself that it's out of respect for your parents, but you're only lying to yourself.\n\nIf your parents loved their child and wanted her to have a safe and secure future, they'd be standing there handing you the pen to sign those papers, knowing that if something happened to you, she'd have more protection because she'd be your legal child and entitled to equal benefits.\n\nThere's no law that says you have to commit to your sister.  There's no legal requirement to adopt her.   But don't pretend you are not hurting her terribly, and don't pretend that her best interests, or your parents', are the reason for your decision.  Nobody can force you to do what you don't want to do, but be honest about it.   You do NOT see her as equal to your children.", "I have a question OP, 6hink into the future. How do you handle things like guys, boys, etc in the future. Forget about the sappy stuff. You're going to tell this girl \"no, i am your brother, not your father.\" That brother role is going to bite you hard in the ass in a couple of years. You will struggle with her. It very well may happen anyway, but trust, you're fueling the fire for future pains for the whole family. Words matter, so of you're rejecting her do it smart. She will through it back in your face some day if this breaks her", "You adopted her when you were 26 and she was 4. She's been your child for more than twice as long as she was your parents'. \n\nYou're never going to be a brother figure to her, and refusing adoption will always feel like a rejection from the only father she really knows.", "That could be a valid point, but it doesn\u2019t seem like OP actually has practical concerns like that.", "But you did replace her parents. They are dead. You can keep the memory alive all you want but she doesn\u2019t remember them they died when she was 3 and didn\u2019t get to have them as parents.

It will give her a sense of stability and belonging. The question to ask her is what are her expectations? Does she want to call you mom and dad? I can get how that wouldn\u2019t feel right.

Find a way to respond compassionately to that and use it as your guide with her.", "They won\u2019t stop being her parents, but you could take on that role.

She\u2019s not trying to replace your father with you, she\u2019s trying to be connected to family like every other kid her age is.

YOU are her PARENT. Get a grip.", "Adoption can mean a lot of different things for different people. It's time to look into it as a family, perhaps through family therapy.

Consult a lawyer as well to make sure you're all working with factual information about adoption and its legal pros and cons.", "But she sees you and knows you as a father YTA", "Most unfortunate as it will likely strain all the relationships involved.", "By asking you to adopt her, she\u2019s telling you she needs to belong more in your family. You adopting her doesn\u2019t change who her dad is. She can still call you by name and know you are her brother, but it makes her place in your family more permanent. She\u2019s a teenager with a lot of thoughts and feelings happening right now. This rejection will sit with her forever and shape her future relationships. You lose nothing by adopting her (and the connection with your parents loses nothing) but you may lose everything by rejecting her. \nDo your parents have siblings? Close friends who knew them well? Ask what your parents would have wanted. I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019d want their daughter to feel the way she does. She likely feels like she isn\u2019t a whole member of your nuclear family. This issue is a bigger turning point in both your marriage and your relationship with your sister than you realize. Give it the real consideration it deserves.", "My man, your parents don\u2019t care anymore. Believe me when I say, they would want their daughter to feel secure in her life, rather than have you cling to the fact that she already has parents. She doesn\u2019t. They\u2019re dead and she\u2019s 13. Have some goddamn compassion.", "NAH, I get where you\u2019re both coming from. But adopting her doesn\u2019t erase your parents in any way!! You\u2019re choosing to keep their memory alive for her. It\u2019s like a step parent; your parents will always be her mom and dad, but now she gets a bonus family with her brother, and that\u2019s a beautiful thing", "Dude, I get it, this is a hard choice that you're not comfortable with, but you'll have to be aware if what will happen if you refuse. Put yourself in your sister's shoes. She has been raised by you since she was 4! In her eyes and memories, you're the only father figure she knows (and im sorry she can't remember your parents beyond photos). Remember that 13 is a very awkward stage in life where people start trying to define who they are and where they belong in the world, her asking this to you is because she needs the reassurance to know that she is loved and truly a part of your family. Clearly she is nervous and being very vulnerable here, and the answer means a lot to her since she went to your wife for help first since she does not want to get rejected. If you say \"No\" to her, she will not take it well. You may be saying that she already is part of your family and that she is loved and that you are connected, but for a 13 year old none of that will matter since your actions will say something else in her eyes. This will definitely hurt her and potentially scar her for life. It will absolutely impact your relationship with her negatively and she might leave as soon as she is 18.\nAs I said this is though situation, but my advise is that you make the choice that will help your family be stronger. Maybe you can set some boundaries like her not calling you \"dad\", but you can still adopt her. It will mean the world to her. And doing this will not disrespect the memories of your parents, obviously they just want both of their children to be happy and in a loving family.\nGood luck to you all.", "That won\u2019t change if you adopt her. You\u2019ll never be her father and I don\u2019t think adopting her will change you into that. She just wants the security of knowing she belongs to your family. Your parents would probably want what is best for her, and that sense of security and permanence is probably best for her.", "Bro, she was 4 if I'm reading that right.  You're her father now, like it or not.  You still have parents.  You got a lifetime of that love and remember it fondly.  She does not.  She'd barely remember any of that, all she remembers is YOU!

If you don't do it at this stage in her life, you're literally going to fuck up her entire adult life.  Daddy issues, drugs, alcohol, endless strings of shitty boyfriends using and abusing her.", "Adopting her won\u2019t change that.  Maybe she needs to know she\u2019s there permanently.  She lost her parents and wants some stability (I\u2019m guessing).  If you\u2019re truly opposed to adoption, is there some other legal means by which you can show her you are not going anywhere?", "Gently, you and she don't have the same memories. He was your dad, but you are hers.", ">Dad will always be our father.\n\nThis is going to sound harsh and it's not intended to be but a father is not the same thing as a Dad. \n\nA father is someone who participated in making you, a Dad is the person who shows up. \n\nA tragic event has prevented your Dad from being her Dad, that mantle has now fallen to you. You are the parent she knows and the one she has that paternal instinct toward. \n\nIt doesn't take away from your Dad to recognise that you're also Reina's parent now. \n\nYou have all the right in the world to not want to go through this adoption but you need to find the right words to explain that this isn't a rejection of her but rather an internal struggle about losing your own parents.", "What will change if you formally adopt her other than the paperwork?", "The thing is, you're really the only father Reina's known. It's great to share stories about your parents with her, but she won't have the same connection you had. That doesn't negate the fact that your parents loved Reina. Adopting her will not erase that. If anything she'll be doubly lucky because she's had two sets of parents love her. Seriously, please have a talk with your sister. Hear her out.", "He will  always be your father. But he died when she was 4. She doesn't even know the guy.", "But she doesn\u2019t remember them. She wants a mom and dad. Do you really think your parents would want her to parent less? She\u2019s 13. She wants a mom and dad. You adopting her doesn\u2019t erase your parents. You seem more concerned about them then you do your living sister who doesn\u2019t feel like she belongs.", "Legal benefits, if she ever spent time in foster care before OP took her in then she'll get college tuition in her state, and then there's the mental health aspect.", "She wants to be adopted. She wants you to be her dad. Let that sink in. That is the absolute highest compliment an adoptive parent can have. You raised her, she's your child. Are you really OK with looking her in the face and telling her you don't consider her your child?", "But you need to understand that the \\*only\\* thing your sister is going to hear from you not adopting her is REJECTION. She is a teenager, and is instinctively going to write herself a little story in her head about not being lovable enough or something being wrong with her that you wouldn't \\*want\\* her to be part of your family, officially. \n\nBy asking to be adopted she is saying, \"I love you like a parent, can I be part of your family forever?\" and you are saying, \"No, I would be uncomfortable with that but don't worry I'll always be your brother.\" Don't you understand that she doesn't even know what that means, what that brother-sister relationship looks like? That reassurance means nothing to her. She's only ever known you as a parent figure, and all she knows now is that you don't want to commit to being her parent. \n\nI mean obviously it's your choice, but I would really think about whether this arbitrary line in the sand you're drawing on family titles is worth literally traumatizing your sister. She will 1000% be going to therapy for many years about this exact conversation you're planning to have with her. YTA if you reject her in such a core way... and also to your wife, who has a very valid point of view on this.", "I think you are making a mistake as well. If Reina told you about adoption, it means she feels a NEED to experience the same childhood as other kids and be raised by a mom and a dad. She probably sees you as a dad already anyway. This would not be a betrayal to your parents. They would just be happy to know that she is safe and loved.", "So my mom couldn\u2019t take care of me anymore when I was 14 (she had drug addiction issues). I spent the next four years spending time at various aunts and uncles. One set for the school year, one set in the summers. \n\nIt really hurt me that I was never a daughter to them. Even though they loved me and I was their niece, I wanted parents. I needed parents. \n\nI recently talked to my aunt and told her \u2018I\u2019ve always kind of hated myself because I think I\u2019m unloveable.

There are frequent posts from people who were raised by step-parents who say over and over that being formally adopted would have been irrelevant to the love an connection they feel for the person who raised them.\n\nI really think the problem here is between the OP and his wife and my remark about the *potiential* for an awful result was more reflective of what might happen if Reina were set up by her sister-in-law to think adoption is the only answer to whatever motivated Reina her request.    That's why it needs to be headed off before a big birthday scene.   OP should talk directly to his sister now.\nneeds to address that directly with his *sister* now.\n\nAnd  yes, I think the wife's idea about what the OP should feel about his own sister should be secondary -- which is why I think that some couples counseling might be needed.", "What implications to the family dynamic? How would that change in any way? He already acts like her father in every way. He's not a replacement for their dad, but he's everything this girl has ever known. I would hope a formal adoption would change absolutely nothing in the family dynamic in this case, but just make her feel more loved and accepted.\n\nAdoption might actually make it easier when she goes to get a learner's permit, wants to travel out of state/country with the rest of the family on vacation, applies for college, etc. I'm a foster parent and this stuff is a nightmare at times.", "What are the implications?", "... ... you are the one being werid.

And again, maybe talk with your wife too on why she is so hellbent on this.", "Is it possible that your wife sees Reina as her daughter and that she wants to adopt her? Maybe you can adopt her and she would still call you by name to keep your sibling relationship but Sarah by \u201cmom\u201d? Idk. Just a thought.

It's only OP who keeps that boundary between them.", "I agree with this.

You can\u2019t have it both ways. You can\u2019t incessantly say SHES A SISTER NOT A DAUGHTER and say I DONT TREAT HER DIFFERENTLY. That\u2019s speaking out of both sides of your mouth.", "YOU are treating her different. All she wants is to belong.", "So what exactly would change in your family dynamic if she were adopted?", "OP, adopting her won\u2019t change your status as her brother who is raising her. But it will have legal benefits for her. Please reconsider.", "It will sure as hell help.", "Yet you won't commit to her with adoption.  Guardianship is much more easily reversible, it is NOT the same commitment, it doesn't provide the same security, and it won't give her the same feeling of belonging, as she has already indicated by wanting to ask for adoption.  \n\nAnd you remain in this thread, just repeatedly saying you think she is equal but making it clear that you refuse to actually put pen to paper and commit to that equality.  As I said, your choice.  Nobody can make you do it.  You don't have any legal obligation to it.  And maybe there are other reasons for not doing it that you haven't considered.    But just stop pretending that at this point it's about your parents or anything other than you and your unwillingness to take that last step in commitment.     And understand that it is an AH move that will almost certainly impact your sister's sense of security and mental health, and possibly your wife's as well, because she clearly sees this child she has raised since the age of 4 as a daughter herself.", "You can\u2019t say they\u2019re equal if you\u2019re not willing to make her equal to your children.", ">Sister is NOT less than daughter. They're equal to me, and I treat them equal.\n\nBut does Reina know that?", "What's going to happen when she becomes a legal adult. Are you going to abandon your fatherly role all together and insist on just being her brother? I promise you Reina sees you as her parent. Why else would she ask for adoption? Sure you're raising her now? What about at 18? 20? She'd already lost her parents once. Is she going to lose them again just because she went from 17 to 18?", "I think the point people are trying to make here is that there are legal protections that Reina would have if she's legally your daughter vs. legally your sister/ dependent.\n\nI think you need to see this from Reina's perspective. She's likely seeing all of her friends do activities with her legal parents and she doesn't have any. That can be incredibly isolating. While my parents are alive, they were largely absent and that shit hurt! I can't imagine what it would be like to be that age and going through this. Even if you're absolutely present and going to all the games and whatever else, you're making a clear deliniation that you're not her father. It's extremely difficult to process that as a pre-teen. She may feel like she's missing out on an essential part of life. I know you also lost your parents, but your emotional maturity was much different when they passed.\n\nI'm reserving my judgment, but it might be wise not to jump into things. Seek family therapy before making any major decisions.", "That\u2019s what I think as well. OP had almost 30 years with his parents. Reina had 4, and at MOST she probably remembers one of those. Their parents will never be as real to Reina as they are to OP and he needs to accept that and accept that in her eyes, he and his wife ARE her new parents. Parents are the people who raise you and love you unconditionally. If OP says \u201cno\u201d tot he adoption, he\u2019s telling Reina not to think of him that way, whether that\u2019s what he thinks he\u2019s doing or not. This isn\u2019t about you, OP.", "OP, the thing you're glazing over here is that you see her as your sister and are holding tightly to the fact that you are her brother. \n\nReina very clearly does not see it this way. She sees you as a Dad and wants security in your family as such. \n\nYou are entitled to feeling that your role as being her guardian and brother is valid, but Reina's feelings about wanting to recognize the man that has raised her as her Dad is *also* valid. \n\nPlease for all that is good, take this girl to some family therapy.", "I don\u2019t understand how you don\u2019t see how hurtful and cruel this is to her. Your parents are dead. You are the only family she has known for 9 years and this is a rejection of her to your family.", "What\u2019s nonsense is refusing paperwork to make a 13 year old orphan feel more secure in the family she\u2019s been raised with for 9 years.", "By all accounts you are her parents. That doesn\u2019t erase your actual parents but she doesn\u2019t remember or know your parents the way you do. This is 100% your choice but all your comments and reasoning seem to be wrapped in your own grief and guilt for replacing your parents. This is going to devastate and cause major harm to your sister. As in something she will be in therapy about as an adult. She doesn\u2019t understand your reasoning at 13 especially because it doesn\u2019t actually make sense to anyone else either. She is essentially feeling abandoned again and you are telling her she isn\u2019t your kid and she isn\u2019t part of your family. Logic and reasoning won\u2019t well here You are viewing this through your view vs the view of a scared 13 year old. The kid will assume the worst about herself. Is that worth protecting the memory of your parents over? Is it worth giving Sarah more trauma and angst and heartbreak to keep the memory of parents she doesn\u2019t remember alive? Is your grief more important than hers right now?", "You seem very concerned about honouring your parents. Unfortunately they have passed away, your sister should be more important than honouring people who are no longer with you.", "I agree with her.\n\n\"I'm raising a child who loves me and is wholly dependent on me \u2014 and I really need to keep some barriers between us.\" *is* a pretty cold position.", "No but it sure as hell should make sense to the kid he\u2019s raising but won\u2019t do paperwork for.", "She wants love and security man.  You adopting her does not take a single thing away from her relationship with  anyone else.", "Clearly that\u2019s how you feel, but not how she feels.", "But, to my limited understanding, guardianship is a one-way street. That is your legal responsibility and authority to make decisions regarding her. Would adopting her make her on-par with your biological children in terms of inheritance? If you and your wife were killed in car accident tomorrow, where does your sister stand in terms of life insurance beneficiary, estate inheritance, etc? Wouldn\u2019t it all go to your biological children by default, unless you\u2019ve specifically designated her in your will? Or, years in the future let\u2019s say you are incapacitated, who gets to make decisions? Your bio-children or your sister? What if there is a falling out between your sister and your kids. Could she be shut out from the same financial and legal benefits they would enjoy? There can be lots of scenarios we don\u2019t anticipate and the default legal preference is usually in favor of children over siblings, with little to no consideration for guardianships. (Varies by state, etc. etc\u2026I know).", "Case by case", "No, birth certificates don't have to be changed with a legal adoption.", "I wouldn't say parent, I would say guardian because (at least where I am) a guardian to do the same things as a parent within the legal boundaries. He views himself as a guardian, and that's it for her, which is fair enough, she is his little sister and does not actually view her as his own child but try's to treat her on equal terms as one of his children, I guess almost like treating a nibbling like one of your own. I don't think he's an asshole for not wanting to actually become her legal father due to his own boundaries, he should sit down with her and communicate with her about it and remind her he does love her but not in the fatherly way but a brotherly way.", "No, you're wanting to tell the child that you've raised for the past 9 years that you don't consider her to be your daughter. Look, I understand your reasoning for the most part. But this girl was orphaned at a very young age. That can absolutely cause abandonment issues. Have you ever stopped to consider her feelings? She lost her family once. She wants to be part of your family. Not your sister looking in at your family, but an actual part of your family.", "You're acting like it's the most simple thing to make a sister equal to a child. \n\nIt's a fucking tough situation, and you're acting like OP is just being a cop out.", "And likely OP & his wife are the only parents his sister ever remembers having.\n\nAnd 13 is a tough age for kids. For her to feel untethered to the only family she knows, there's a primal part of her that maybe fears that she's not really 'one of the family.' She doesn't have a real place, because she's just someone her brother HAS to care fore, but she has no real family, her sibling isn't really a sibling because he's her dad, it's heartbreaking.\n\nOP, I say gently, YTA for thinking only of your feelings, not hers. And please, please, please look into counseling for the both of you. Yes, it's been 9 years, but a lot has happened in that 9 years, I bet.  \n\n\nEdit to add: I have to wonder if this isn't the last bit of a wall OP has put up around his feelings about his parent's deaths. Like, if he adopts his sister, it's FINAL. The last bit of that wall comes all the way down, and that deep, dark part of him will have to accept that his parents are well and truly gone, this isn't temporary, and they aren't coming back. I know logically OP knows this, but subconsciously...well, nobody really wants to let go all the way to people we love.", "How cruel can you possibly be. He's not comfortable with this at all, why force it on him when he doesn't even feel ready or comfortable to even consider it.", "The paperwork means something that OP is not ready to accept. And given his post, I'm certain that if the girl really, really hurts about this, even after having the talk about his reservations, he will do it.\n\nThe point is the SO being super judgmental about this.", "I think they both have trauma from the parental loss. That makes his sister want this adoption to feel like she\u2019s not going to be abandoned, while OP is terrified to tarnish the memory of his parents in any way, so he thinks this is replacing them or disrespecting them.", "Thank you!", "And she is a part of OP's family. Just not as a daughter and that should be okay."]}
