If your brother is autistic it's possible that you are too, because it's genetic. It makes perfect sense that you'd be trying to find out more information about your own childhood symptoms.", "Your father is definitely the AH here. He apparently feels that his life is a secret and the fact that he didn't want to talk to you. He should be happy that you went to your mom. You didn't go asking his neighbors or anyone else. And if he claims he doesn't remember you talking, I call BS on his statement. \n\nNTA\n\nEdit: Continue to talk to your mom. You did nothing wrong!", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like there's more to this story tho with the way your dad reacted", "NTA. This is a situation where you have learned a potential new fact about your family's medical history. Your mom would need to know since it could affect your medical care too.", "NTA. It\u2019s natural to share family information (I know that\u2019s \u201cgossipy\u201d but it happens) and you absolutely should be able to confide in your mom.\n\nShould she have contacted your dad about it? Probably not.\n\nBear in mind too, your dad and his wife are probably pretty raw and sensitive about this issue right now, but that will probably change. I doubt they\u2019ll stay angry for long.\n\nYou sound like a caring kid, and that\u2019s a good thing. Don\u2019t get too in your head about this or worry about being an asshole.", "It seems like your dad wants to keep private info about his other child from your mom and didn't even want to share with you until you pushed. It's fine for him not to involve your mom with his other child. I'm guessing they don't have a good relationship. It's fine that you want to ask your mom about something from your childhood she's brought up before and your dad has contradicted. You're NTA unless you're purposefully looking to start problems between them. I do think it's important to be mindful of how info you're sharing comes across and to examine what your goals are from this conversation. I'm not sure what your goal is here. Are you looking for a diagnosis for yourself? Are you concerned about your brother? Either way, it's a good idea to ask about those things clearly.", "NTA at all.\n\nAs a mother, I always encourage my children to tell me everything they are comfortable sharing with me, no matter their age. If anything happens to or around them that makes them want to talk to me for any reason then they can do that. Regardless of the topic or if anyone else involved wants them to tell me. If my child wants to confide in me, then that is only their decision. They do that on a regular basis, basically whenever something confuses them or bothers them. \n\nThe difference is, I know how to keep my mouth shut. If I even have the slightest suspicion that whatever my child shared with me was not supposed to be shared, then I will make sure my child will never be in an uncomfortable situation because of it.\n\nSo, the AH here is your father for expecting you to keep things to yourself and also your mother for getting involved in a situation that is none of your business and exposing you for confiding in her. Not you. At all.", "You're NTA but your Mum should have kept her mouth shut about it and your Dad should be more understanding of the situation you're in. NTA at all. Parents need to grow up a bit though, I'd say.", "NTA (but your mom is). That\u2019s not gossiping, but your mom should have stayed out of it. It\u2019s not her business. It\u2019s 100% fine to talk to her about stuff related to your sibling, but she shouldn\u2019t then turn around and call your dad. It does sound like it\u2019s a little weird on dad\u2019s side, but mom should have known better than to butt in.", "NAH only bc there's no response for just your mom. She should never have called your dad about his child's medical issues. You can discuss things with your mom, of course, but if she's going to do things like that, I would be more selective with what you share with her.", "Kind of YTA. You don't talk about other people's medical stuff like this. Your dad and stepmother are right in that this was none of your mother's business.", "Very soft YTA\nYou are only 17. That is still a child. Your father  understandably, didn't want to discuss his son's medical condition with you in detail, and that is very logical. You should not have pushed or started questioning your father's actions. While it is OK for you to discuss things that worry you (in all aspects of life) with your mother,  she is also the AH for calling your dad and getting involved. It is not her son and his condition is not her business. \nI understand your concern for both your brother and also maybe for yourself, but you need to stay out of it.  Leave the diagnosis to professionals.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

If he doesn\u2019t want you sharing information about things with your mother, he needs to specify that. It isn\u2019t that hard to say \u201cI am not ready to talk further about this and I would appreciate you keeping this matter to yourself.\u201d OP is a young adult, had no I\u2019ll will, and it\u2019s certainly still dad\u2019s responsibility to continue teaching OP about appropriate boundaries.\n\nDo I think dad is TA? No. He\u2019s probably going through a lot because people are petrified of Autism (not saying that it is anything to be afraid of, but they are).", "NTA. You were looking out for yourself and your half-brother. If speaking late is a shared trait, than it is possible that it is genetic. That might be a piece of information that the pediatrician might take into account when evaluating whether your half-brother has autism. On the other hand, you might yourself consider checking if you are in the autism spectrum, if your brother is diagnosed.\n\nYour parents do not have to like each other, but they should try harder to not burden you with their conflicts. You should be able to go to both of them with your medical concerns, and they should not expect you to keep your brothers medical details a secret when they are connected to yours.", "NTA. However, when your dad calms down, please tell him that while you did not mean to upset him and your stepmother, you have a right to know if you're also autistic, because it is genetic. Please ask him to set up an appointment with your pediatrician and get a confirmation.", "NTA", "Autism can run in families and I'd be willing to bet that you have it, your half-brother has it and your father has it. Denial of medical reality is always a mistake.\n\nNTA", "Yep, YTA, don\u2019t go talking about other peoples medical conditions ever. Even among family, lesson learned about manners :/", "Honestly this is what I was thinking too. \n\nIf it\u2019s true that op didn\u2019t speak really at all until almost 5, it doesn\u2019t look too good for dad \u201cnot remembering,\u201d and \u201cmom making it up.\u201d I\u2019m a little suspicious of the dad here. The fact that he\u2019s shutting down further conversation with op is a little concerning.", "Part of me feels the dad is ashamed of the possible diagnosis. The fact that he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it makes it seem like he doesn\u2019t want to confront the reality of it.", "I think it reads as the dad not remembering OP not speaking until 5 and then generating full sentences. I'm guessing these parents are distrustful of one another and they shouldn't involve OP in fights. They both need to sit down and answer questions that OP has together but that seems unlikely.", "This is a really good point.", "Yes you do talk about other people's medical stuff when it directly affects you. If OP's brother is autistic it's very possible that OP might be as well, hence why OP's trying to find out more information about his own childhood behaviour. OP's NTA at all and his father is extremely inconsiderate.", "How will OP \"leave the diagnosis to professionals\" if OP is underage and needs either his father or mother to take him to professionals in the first place, to be diagnosed??\n\nNo, it's not understandable that OP's father would not want to discuss his son's medical condition with OP, because that particular medical condition is genetic and one son being autistic makes it very likely that his other children might be as well. \n\nOP questioned his father and mother about OP themselves, because OP wants to find out whether they also had developmental delays. And his father didn't want to answer that, which makes him TA for omitting such important information, or claiming not to remember. It makes perfect sense that OP would then question his mother about it, because it's their right to know if there's a possibilitythat they might be autistic as well. OP is NTA in any way.", "You probably hit it right on the nail. Pretty sad that they have to involve their kid in their back and forth.", "But OP is not being diagnosed. The younger brother is. OP need to stay out of THAT issue and not question father's actions.\nIf OP has concerns about themselves (I thought so too but I am not sure the original post actually suggested that directly, it was more like  \"I was the same and am not autistic so younger brother must not be either\"), OP can ask to be diagnosed, again,  by professionals. Going online to self diagnose and comparing one's self to the brother isn't a good idea. Questioning the mother about yourself is fine.  Using that info to compare to younger brother is not."]}
