He apparently feels that his life is a secret and the fact that he didn't want to talk to you. He should be happy that you went to your mom. You didn't go asking his neighbors or anyone else.

It's fine that you want to ask your mom about something from your childhood she's brought up before and your dad has contradicted. You're NTA unless you're purposefully looking to start problems between them. I do think it's important to be mindful of how info you're sharing comes across and to examine what your goals are from this conversation. I'm not sure what your goal is here. Are you looking for a diagnosis for yourself? Are you concerned about your brother? Either way, it's a good idea to ask about those things clearly.", "NTA at all.\n\nAs a mother, I always encourage my children to tell me everything they are comfortable sharing with me, no matter their age. If anything happens to or around them that makes them want to talk to me for any reason then they can do that. Regardless of the topic or if anyone else involved wants them to tell me. If my child wants to confide in me, then that is only their decision. They do that on a regular basis, basically whenever something confuses them or bothers them. \n\nThe difference is, I know how to keep my mouth shut. If I even have the slightest suspicion that whatever my child shared with me was not supposed to be shared, then I will make sure my child will never be in an uncomfortable situation because of it.\n\nSo, the AH here is your father for expecting you to keep things to yourself and also your mother for getting involved in a situation that is none of your business and exposing you for confiding in her. Not you. At all.", "You're NTA but your Mum should have kept her mouth shut about it and your Dad should be more understanding of the situation you're in. NTA at all.

You can discuss things with your mom, of course, but if she's going to do things like that, I would be more selective with what you share with her.", "Kind of YTA. You don't talk about other people's medical stuff like this. Your dad and stepmother are right in that this was none of your mother's business.", "Very soft YTA\nYou are only 17. That is still a child. Your father  understandably, didn't want to discuss his son's medical condition with you in detail, and that is very logical. You should not have pushed or started questioning your father's actions. While it is OK for you to discuss things that worry you (in all aspects of life) with your mother,  she is also the AH for calling your dad and getting involved. It is not her son and his condition is not her business. \nI understand your concern for both your brother and also maybe for yourself, but you need to stay out of it.

If he doesn\u2019t want you sharing information about things with your mother, he needs to specify that. It isn\u2019t that hard to say \u201cI am not ready to talk further about this and I would appreciate you keeping this matter to yourself.\u201d OP is a young adult, had no I\u2019ll will, and it\u2019s certainly still dad\u2019s responsibility to continue teaching OP about appropriate boundaries.\n\nDo I think dad is TA? No. He\u2019s probably going through a lot because people are petrified of Autism (not saying that it is anything to be afraid of, but they are).", "NTA. You were looking out for yourself and your half-brother. If speaking late is a shared trait, than it is possible that it is genetic. That might be a piece of information that the pediatrician might take into account when evaluating whether your half-brother has autism. On the other hand, you might yourself consider checking if you are in the autism spectrum, if your brother is diagnosed.\n\nYour parents do not have to like each other, but they should try harder to not burden you with their conflicts. You should be able to go to both of them with your medical concerns, and they should not expect you to keep your brothers medical details a secret when they are connected to yours.", "NTA. However, when your dad calms down, please tell him that while you did not mean to upset him and your stepmother, you have a right to know if you're also autistic, because it is genetic. Please ask him to set up an appointment with your pediatrician and get a confirmation.", "NTA", "Autism can run in families and I'd be willing to bet that you have it, your half-brother has it and your father has it.

Even among family, lesson learned about manners :/", "Honestly this is what I was thinking too. \n\nIf it\u2019s true that op didn\u2019t speak really at all until almost 5, it doesn\u2019t look too good for dad \u201cnot remembering,\u201d and \u201cmom making it up.\u201d I\u2019m a little suspicious of the dad here. The fact that he\u2019s shutting down further conversation with op is a little concerning.", "Part of me feels the dad is ashamed of the possible diagnosis. The fact that he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it makes it seem like he doesn\u2019t want to confront the reality of it.", "I think it reads as the dad not remembering OP not speaking until 5 and then generating full sentences. I'm guessing these parents are distrustful of one another and they shouldn't involve OP in fights. They both need to sit down and answer questions that OP has together but that seems unlikely.", "This is a really good point.", "Yes you do talk about other people's medical stuff when it directly affects you. If OP's brother is autistic it's very possible that OP might be as well, hence why OP's trying to find out more information about his own childhood behaviour. OP's NTA at all and his father is extremely inconsiderate.", "How will OP \"leave the diagnosis to professionals\" if OP is underage and needs either his father or mother to take him to professionals in the first place, to be diagnosed??\n\nNo, it's not understandable that OP's father would not want to discuss his son's medical condition with OP, because that particular medical condition is genetic and one son being autistic makes it very likely that his other children might be as well. \n\nOP questioned his father and mother about OP themselves, because OP wants to find out whether they also had developmental delays. And his father didn't want to answer that, which makes him TA for omitting such important information, or claiming not to remember. It makes perfect sense that OP would then question his mother about it, because it's their right to know if there's a possibilitythat they might be autistic as well. OP is NTA in any way.", "You probably hit it right on the nail. Pretty sad that they have to involve their kid in their back and forth.", "But OP is not being diagnosed. The younger brother is. OP need to stay out of THAT issue and not question father's actions.\nIf OP has concerns about themselves (I thought so too but I am not sure the original post actually suggested that directly, it was more like  \"I was the same and am not autistic so younger brother must not be either\"), OP can ask to be diagnosed, again,  by professionals. Going online to self diagnose and comparing one's self to the brother isn't a good idea. Questioning the mother about yourself is fine.  Using that info to compare to younger brother is not.", "NTA. You can talk to your parents about everything you want, and everyone telling you not to do this is wrong.\n\nBut I think your mom shouldn't have called your dad, as his young kid is really none of her business.", "NTA. It\u2019s ok to talk to your mom. But! Your mom should not have called him. Not her business.", "NTA, and to answer your question yes, being non-verbal for five years and then coming out in full competent sentences is quite common amongst those of us on the spectrum. My sister was diagnosed when she was 4, I'm 25 and masked severely as a child in order to provide support to my family and have only recently been referred for diagnosis (officially diagnosed ADHD last year). This is definitely something that you should get into with your mother, your dad shouldn't be discouraging this discussion and also he's a bit of an AH for treating a potential autism diagnosis like it's the end of the world.", "You are NTA. Your mom overstepped her boundaries. She might be TA", "Did you mean harm? Probably not. But...Your dad may not have wanted to tell you much out of fear you'd tell your mom. And let's be fair, it really isn't your mother's business what happens in your dad's home unless it directly affects you.", "There is a good chance dad has autism as well and is sensitive about it because autism makes understanding emotions harder and emotions are amplified", "ESH. You didn\u2019t think maybe you could have given a different story to your mom? Like, Suzy (or fake name) from class mentioned this and it sounded like something I grew up with, so I wanted to ask you if this was a thing. \n\nI think your Dad was probably a bit overwhelmed by what was going on and didn\u2019t know how to handle it. You don\u2019t want to put something out there and have people worry for nothing and checking for updates every 5 minutes (this gets exhausting). I also understand your Dad not wanting your Mom to know about this because it\u2019s not her business (not her child) and she shouldn\u2019t have brought it up to him.\n\nAs for your half-sibling\u2026 I would be so upset at having my medical history discussed with people that didn\u2019t need to know. My dad told one of his friends about a diagnosis of mine a few years ago (he was asking for advice) and I wanted to crawl under a rock because his friend came up and talked to me about it later. It put me in an awful spot and now I don\u2019t even want to look at the guy when I run into him. Family will talk and your half-sibling will eventually pick up on things and have feelings one way or the other.", "Your mom has no right to your brothers medical stuff PERIOD...it's wrong yiu told her and YTA", "NTA\n\nI think it\u2019s more about not wanting his new wife or anyone else to realise you are autistic too and he never once paid enough attention to notice major signs like not talking until five. He doesn\u2019t want to be shown as a sh dad so is a worse one by trying to hide it from you and everyone and turning it all on you. It wasn\u2019t about disclosing your half brothers info it was about realising he knew you have the same difficulties and decided to hide important information from you.", "NTA. I think your dad and stepmom are feeling pretty stressed right now and have taken a bit of that stress out on you. Your questions are reasonable, but I can see how they might be feeling upset about your mom being involved in something they are very worried about and is so personal for them.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of this has to do with what kind of relationship your mom/dad/stepmom have and whether your mom was being helpful or nosey. Clearly, her call wasn't helpful even if she intended it to be. Consider apologizing for talking about the situation with your mom because it clearly upset them, but that you were worried and your dad didn't want to talk to you about it. \n\nIt may offer an opportunity for a much better discussion with your dad and stepmom about how you'll work together as a family to get your little brother whatever he needs going forward, but that talking openly would help you a lot.", "NTA. I wonder if stepmom might get understanding of things if she spoke to the main caregiver of the older kid. Share some information. Plus OP needs to know what\u2019s going on with a younger sibling. What if he needs to care for his brother one day.", "NTA, you should be able to talk to your mom with out her repeating what you said. She is the TA here.", "Sounds like you had similar symptoms as a kid, your mom noticed and your dad brushed it off.\n\nNow that the same thing is going on with your half brother and he's actually following through with medical care, it puts him in a bad light with how he handled your situation.\n\nNTA.", "NTA you were not gossiping. Your father is being defensive. My cousin did not speak until he was three, and then it was a full sentence. Don't know if he is autistic, but his son certainly is (he has been assessed.) You might want to get assessed, but only if you think you have autistic traits which are negatively affecting your life.", "NTA but I guarantee there is much more going on than just a speaking delay if the Ped has suggested evaluation. If your dad doesn't remember you having a delay, then he likely isn't noticing everything that can be going on with your brother. A similar thing happened with my spouse- as the say at home mom, I noticed issues far before she did (regressive speech, not being able to be held by anyone except me, not showing the ability to have side by side play even with siblings without becoming overwhelmed). My spouse had surgery when our youngest was 21 months old and she was home for 2 weeks- 10 days in she looked at me and said 'Fire- I think Goose is Autistic'. My response was that I'd only been bringing that up for 9 months at that point. We had a Ped appointment for his asthma the next month anyway and she immediately referred him for assessment. Unlike when my second youngest was diagnosed (several years later) it was very obvious that my youngest was on the spectrum.\n\nI'm not saying your dad doesn't love you or your brother, but sometimes the working parent will miss ALOT. Maybe talk with your step-mom, just explain that you are curious. There's nothing wrong with voicing things to your mom, but your mom shouldn't be calling your dad about something that isn't her concern.", "I'm going slightly against the grain here, you're NTA, but I think everyone here enabling you to shuttle information between your households is doing you a disservice. Reading between the lines your parents do not have a great relationship (and thats common most people don't have idealistic blended families), you don't seem suprised that your mom called your dad regarding the yet to be diagnosed health issues of his younger son, when he and his wife are probably quite raw about the possibility. At 17 you are quite capable of asking your mother about  your own developmental delays and if she, your dad or any healthcare professionals had any concerns because you became aware that these can be indicators of autism without bringing up your brother. It's not about keeping secrets, it's about respecting boundaries, yours, your dad's, his wife's and your brother's. \n\nIf your brother is actually diagnosed, this would have been an apt opportunity to tell your dad that you notice similarities in symptoms and you will be telling your mom because this could also affect you and she has a right to know. \n\nIt sucks your dad was dismissive - you deserve more than I don't remember, even if it's something upsetting like when you were younger I wasn't as attentive as I should have been. Right now you need to look out for your best interests and that means not having either parent think you're an agent for the other. They are both putting you in an unfair position.", "YTA, because 17 is old enough to know better than to violate personal privacy, but not as big a one as your mother. What she expected to achieve beyond driving a wedge and creating mistrust between you and your other family is a mystery to me.\n\nHmm. Does mom have a history of being jealous of dad?", "You could be autistic as well because you are not picking up on the obvious social cue that your father doesn\u2019t want to discuss this with you. Don\u2019t fixate and research, just respect his decision. My brother in law is 30 and is just now being tested and diagnosed because his mother thought he was \u201cfine\u201d too but he was on the spectrum. He\u2019s the smartest guy I know. He just had a hard time with social cues and everything is very literal to him.", "I think you\u2019re right on the money. OP asking questions about seeking diagnosis for symptoms that could be similar is very sensible, why is OP\u2019s dad so reluctant to consider that OP have the same issue? Is OP\u2019s mom resistant to the idea that autism could be an issue for OP too?", "NTA, but worth keeping in mind that there is still a stigma around autism and a lot of parents don't know how to process the information. There can also be a lot of internal guilt from 'missing' the signs in older children or even in themselves when younger relatives get diagnosed.  Rightly or wrongly, your dad is probably dealing with a lot of conflicting feelings over this news, and it's worth being aware of that going forward. There's absolutely nothing wrong with being autistic- I'm autistic- but it's often poorly understood and people of a certain age will see it as a big scary horrible thing.\n\nOP, you did nothing wrong, but your mom and dad both handled this poorly. It is ultimately sensitive information, but you should be able to trust that your mother, a grown adult, will not go tatting back to your dad. \n\nYour dad also needs to understand that this is obviously going to be of interest to you and that if one of his children is autistic, its likely that his other children might also be on the spectrum; indeed, he himself might be! It's very common for adults to be diagnosed after their kids. \n\nHaving said all that, it's not on OP to manage the complicated emotions of their parents or referee their relationship.", "I never lie to my mom.", "This is such a weird question that I don't even know how to answer it.", "Very much disagree. \n\nThe violation of personal privacy is done to understand their own personal situation, was good natured, was not gossiping and was done due to being completely shut down by the father. \n\nThe mother calling dad directly may not be a great idea. But we don't know that relationship dynamic. The father sounds a little ashamed/embarrassed. \n\nOp is NTA.", "Dad genuinely might not remember. My autistic husband has a terrible memory. (My autistic nb offspring has an irritatingly good memory, so it is not necessarily an autistic trait to have a bad memory.)", "He's reluctant because of there's something \"wrong\" with one kid (please note that I do NOT consider being on the spectrum or other neurodivergences as diseases or flaws, but I acknowledge that some AH folks do) that's just bad luck, or he gets it from his mom's side or whatever. If two kids with two different women are both on the spectrum, though? That means they almost certainly get those genes from him. Which would make him the \"defective\" one. Which is unacceptable, for obvious reasons.", "But she could have gone to her mom and asked questions without mentioning her little brother. She could have easily said \"oh a friend of mine was recently diagnosed, and these were the signs.\"", "Honestly I agree with this, dad probably doesn\u2019t want to admit that this probably comes from his side of the family. He sees it as something \u201cwrong,\u201d which is messed up, and now probably doesn\u2019t want op getting a diagnosis as it both confirms that it\u2019s from him and also may look a little neglectful as op is 17 and may have shown some pretty common symptoms of ASD.\n\nAlso again if it\u2019s true the op didn\u2019t really speak until almost 5\u2026how did he not get evaluated by some medical professional?!?! That\u2019s really concerning, it may not have even been ASD but still.", "He's not questioning his father's actions. His brother's referral has made him have questions about himself which he asked about his mum, she asked him why he was asking all these questions so he told her. He wasn't going \"omg can you believe what my dad's doing!?\"\n\nFYI one of the things they ask you when getting diagnosed is about whether anyone in your family has it. It's very common for the diagnosis of one sibling to lead to other siblings referring.", "OK, maybe I misunderstood the original post then.  You are so adamant that OP is male when I saw no indication of that,  that I am wondering what else I missed...", "I'm not, that's just that people tend to default to male when they don't know. I'm trying to get out of the habit but apparently, not quite managing it yet. If there are reasons OP might be autistic it actually makes more sense that they're female as girls are hugely underdiagnosed"]}
