My man and I have divided out families into two groups. The Capital C Christians(C3's) and everyone else. We're both from fairly conservative families that live really close, so we see uncles, aunts, cousins, etc on the reg and anytime there's a squabble in the family is blows up to stupid proportions. My man actually works for one of those uncles.\n\nWhen we were first planning  we were trying to come up with fun ideas. My Man of Honor works on a dude ranch and they have this really awesome outdoor space that they do weddings at, and there's three local food trucks that do amazing catering jobs. I don't really like traditional white wedding dresses, so we were looking at more colorful ones for me and suits for him. Really just having fun with our friends and family you know?\n\nThen we realized that the C3's in our families would flip out about it not being godly enough or whatever. No white dresses, no churches, no priests telling me to obey my husband, have a Man of Honor instead of a Maid, etc.\n\nWe felt out some of those relatives too, to see if they'd be more open minded? Nope, at least four people went on tirades about not getting married in churches. We can't exactly exclude all of them or the drama would get us our own NBC show.\n\nSo we got the idea that we would have a second wedding. A stiff, traditional wedding at the church with just our family around us, and then a second wedding (more like a hyped up reception at this point, but we both think of it as our Real Wedding) at the ranch with all of our friends and the family members that we actually get along with.\n\nMy sister, one of the C3's, found out about it on accident from our brother and is furious with me. She thinks we're being horrible for excluding half our families from our real wedding and is threatening to tell everyone about it. She told me that my wedding is for our families to be bound, not for me to throw a party. She had her wedding in the same church last month and it was nice enough, I'm not trying to be special or detract from her wedding.\n\nI'd rather just have a courthouse wedding if that's what it comes down to, but my sister was so hurt and it's becoming such an awful thing that I'm starting wonder if she's right and we should have just gone along with tradition in the first place.\n\nEDIT: Only the members of the wedding party knew that the second wedding wasn't just a reception. We were going to sit through the church vows, and then exchange our own at the second wedding as a 'reaffirmation' or whatever, since none of our friends would have been at the church wedding, just family. We will self-solemnize the week prior.

You have a right to have your own wedding the way you want to have it and celebrate it! Your sister had her wedding the way she wanted to have it, and now it's your turn. Of she doesn't like it, she can just not come! Same as the rest of your family. For goodness sake! You're having two weddings. She gets what she wants and you get what you want! Nobody else does that for their sister and other family members, so she should be thank you instead of being hurt and blackmailing you! If she wants to go to your real wedding then she needs to accept that your wedding is going to be the way you want it to be and leave the comments about religion at home and not breathe a word of it to your other family members. That said, your secret wedding is probably going to get out either way and was probably going to happen regardless of what you did. If your brother hadn't slipped up now, then someone who attended the wedding would at some point would tell a story about your real wedding to someone who wasn't there, or to someone who was where someone who wasn't invited would hear. So no matter what at some point the cat was going to get out of the bag. I'd tell everyone who's not invited to your real wedding about it so that she can't hold it as leverage, and tell them that they can go to your real wedding if they can leave religious commitments at home and if they can't, they don't go.

Call the first one \"church wedding ceremony\" and the second one \"vow affirmation and reception.\"\n\nHave a double RSVP so you know who will be at one but not the other, and who will be at both. The guests can sort themselves out.", "I would say fuck it, have the courthouse wedding, and your own party. Invite everyone you want but under the caveat that they're only allowed to come if they keep their opinions to themselves. If they're going to be judgmental, they can stay home. \n\nOr even better, leave the conservatives at home. Tell them that they made it clear they wouldn't support you and didn't approve, so you decide not to subject them to something they hated. Then block their numbers.\n\nNTA. Life is too short to spend this much time appeasing bigots.", "Don\u2019t have a second wedding. It wouldn\u2019t make you an asshole to anyone but yourself. You get the have the wedding YOU and YOUR FIANC\u00c9E want. Only Have the ranch wedding. Your family can attend or not. You need to extract yourself from this toxic situation. They need to know they don\u2019t control you and if they make a stink they can expect you to go NC and write them off.", "NTA, but as someone who grew up in a conservative family and planned a wedding to please everyone else and lived a life to please everyone else for far too long just stop. Because it won\u2019t stop, all this will continue once you have kids and likely get worse because people like that can\u2019t help themselves, they have to try and control how you raise your kids. Just live your life, if they don\u2019t like it they don\u2019t have to attend the wedding, they don\u2019t have to be a part of your life, I felt like I was living a double life for many years, I had a Facebook for the conservative side and my real Facebook, and the same for IG and it was too much. I deleted all my Facebook accounts and went to one IG, if people want to get their panties in a bunch about what I post then they can unfollow. Fortunately most of my family is non combative and will never say anything, just judge me behind my back but when I realized I was doing it so they wouldn\u2019t judge me behind my back I realized how ridiculous it all was. It\u2019s very freeing to get off the crazy train.", "Your wedding is about you, your spouse, and the future you are starting together. Lay the foundation well - have the wedding YOU want, and if anyone has a problem with that, they don\u2019t need to attend. NTA.", "Have the wedding you want. Have the life you want. If people don't like it, THATS ON THEM. Their feelings are their own. Stay out of the drama, simply don't acknowledge it. You aren't doing anything wrong, it's your life. NTA", "I think lying about it to begin with is weird, though. This wouldn't have been as much of an issue if you were upfront about it.", "OP, it really sounds like some clear, strong boundaries are in order here. If you do not share their beliefs, you are not obligated to abide by them. Don\u2019t let your family bully you with their Christian supremacy bs.\n\nETA- it may also be worthwhile to seriously consider if these are relationships worth maintaining, family or not, if they are going to be so controlling as to bully and harasses you to have a wedding that is acceptable to THEM. That does not sound like a healthy relationship where you are respected as an individual, but one where you are expected to toe the party line\u2026 or else.", "Have the wedding you want and the 3Cs can come or not. \n\nBut you may want to remind them that the church is not a building, it's the body of believers. If they are present, then the church is there.\n\nYou may also want to remind them that according to their beliefs, God is everywhere. So you're being married in the presence of God regardless of the ceremony location.\n\n\"For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.\u201d\n\nMatthew 18:20 ESV", "It's a vow renewal, not a wedding."]}
