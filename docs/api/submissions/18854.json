{"id": 18854, "submission_id": "13z7zqo", "title": "WIBTA for having a second wedding?", "selftext": "Okay, this is a throw away and all the names are changed because too many people use reddit lol\n\nSo, I'm getting married next year. My man and I have divided out families into two groups. The Capital C Christians(C3's) and everyone else. We're both from fairly conservative families that live really close, so we see uncles, aunts, cousins, etc on the reg and anytime there's a squabble in the family is blows up to stupid proportions. My man actually works for one of those uncles.\n\nWhen we were first planning  we were trying to come up with fun ideas. My Man of Honor works on a dude ranch and they have this really awesome outdoor space that they do weddings at, and there's three local food trucks that do amazing catering jobs. I don't really like traditional white wedding dresses, so we were looking at more colorful ones for me and suits for him. Really just having fun with our friends and family you know?\n\nThen we realized that the C3's in our families would flip out about it not being godly enough or whatever. No white dresses, no churches, no priests telling me to obey my husband, have a Man of Honor instead of a Maid, etc.\n\nWe felt out some of those relatives too, to see if they'd be more open minded? Nope, at least four people went on tirades about not getting married in churches. We can't exactly exclude all of them or the drama would get us our own NBC show.\n\nSo we got the idea that we would have a second wedding. A stiff, traditional wedding at the church with just our family around us, and then a second wedding (more like a hyped up reception at this point, but we both think of it as our Real Wedding) at the ranch with all of our friends and the family members that we actually get along with.\n\nMy sister, one of the C3's, found out about it on accident from our brother and is furious with me. She thinks we're being horrible for excluding half our families from our real wedding and is threatening to tell everyone about it. She told me that my wedding is for our families to be bound, not for me to throw a party. She had her wedding in the same church last month and it was nice enough, I'm not trying to be special or detract from her wedding.\n\nI'd rather just have a courthouse wedding if that's what it comes down to, but my sister was so hurt and it's becoming such an awful thing that I'm starting wonder if she's right and we should have just gone along with tradition in the first place.\n\nEDIT: Only the members of the wedding party knew that the second wedding wasn't just a reception. We were going to sit through the church vows, and then exchange our own at the second wedding as a 'reaffirmation' or whatever, since none of our friends would have been at the church wedding, just family. We will self-solemnize the week prior.

The Christians in your family that feel they're entitled to tell you how to get married and behave are excluding themselves by holding on to their conservative views of what a marriage is. Explaining this to your sister is unlikely to sway her but if you feel it's worth the oxygen, go for it. If she doesn't get it, then that's on her.\n\nRegardless. NTA. Go have the best wedding you want and if people want to be salty over it tell them there's a second one they're invited to and if they're still salty then the best thing to do is tell them to go fuck themselves.

It\u2019s your wedding, do whatever you want - two weddings, one wedding, courthouse weddings\u2026 You\u2019ll still end up married either way. \nYour sister being upset is also valid since you were planning to exclude her and others from a second wedding - of course they would be upset once they found out. Were you planning to keep it a secret forever? I\u2019d be upset if my sibling did the same to me. Idk how your family rolls but why didn\u2019t you just tell them your plans to do both traditional and party?", "Definitely NTA! You have a right to have your own wedding the way you want to have it and celebrate it! Your sister had her wedding the way she wanted to have it, and now it's your turn. Of she doesn't like it, she can just not come! Same as the rest of your family. For goodness sake! You're having two weddings. She gets what she wants and you get what you want! Nobody else does that for their sister and other family members, so she should be thank you instead of being hurt and blackmailing you! If she wants to go to your real wedding then she needs to accept that your wedding is going to be the way you want it to be and leave the comments about religion at home and not breathe a word of it to your other family members. That said, your secret wedding is probably going to get out either way and was probably going to happen regardless of what you did. If your brother hadn't slipped up now, then someone who attended the wedding would at some point would tell a story about your real wedding to someone who wasn't there, or to someone who was where someone who wasn't invited would hear. So no matter what at some point the cat was going to get out of the bag. I'd tell everyone who's not invited to your real wedding about it so that she can't hold it as leverage, and tell them that they can go to your real wedding if they can leave religious commitments at home and if they can't, they don't go. They're lucky you even consider a second wedding just for them that they would approve of, because I wouldn't!\n\nEdit for typo", "NTA obviously. Let's see; YOUR wedding day that you'll remember for the rest of your life vs your family's arbitrary dogma. I wonder what's more important", "Sorry, but yes, YTA. Did you think no one would realize? There\u2019s bound to be some crossover between these groups. Did you think people don\u2019t talk to each other? You\u2019re attempting to prevent people from judging your life choices by excluding literally everyone from some part of your big day? That\u2019s swapping your potentially hurt feelings for theirs. If you think they\u2019re going to dislike you more over a coloured dress than they will over telling them they\u2019re not welcome, that just blows my mind.\n\nDo your officiants know about the dual wedding? Both you and they are going to need to know which one is legal. Officiants typically have protocols for situations where they\u2019re not actually marrying the couple. \n\nYou need to do some damage control right now and either combine your ceremonies or let everyone know they\u2019re welcome at both and let them decide. The only other thing I could think of is framing the more personal ceremony as an elopement, which people usually find more forgivable. But that\u2019s tricky since it\u2019s clearly not spur-of-the-moment, has a hefty guest list and is happening after the church ceremony.\n\nI should add that I get wanting to personalize your day, and I would have been all for having the dude ranch ceremony only and foregoing the church, and telling whoever doesn\u2019t like it can suck a bible. But this division of guests is weird and kind of cruel.", "NTA try to remember this is YOUR wedding if they choose not to come that\u2019s on them.

Not just in church", "NTA I don't have any suggestions for how to deal with unreasonable and controlling people, but you haven't done anything wrong. If anything it seems you bent over backward to make everyone happy  \nI have a set bit of advice that I give to brides: you won't make everyone happy, it's not possible. People determined to find fault will, no matter how much you compromise. But you can please yourself and your soon to be spouse. That's who I would focus on", "NTA but do the courthouse wedding thing or do the wedding YOU actually want and everyone else can screw off. They like big church weddings?  They can have a big church wedding. You want to get married on a dude ranch  with multi-colored mirrors on you hobnail boots?  DO THAT.  As your seeing now if you try to make everyone happy you will make no one happy.  So  just make yourselves happy.", "NTA You are doing all you can to avoid family drama, and doing both weddings, also the one that you don't want, for the sake of family peace, is a good compromise.\nYour sister cannot at the same time think that your real wedding is the non-traditional one, and that you need a traditional wedding to be properly married. It is either one or the other. It seems that she just want a free family party under the pretense of C3 compliant wedding.", "NTA.\n\nI'm religious and if someone doesn't want to have a wedding of any religious faith, then they don't have to. I don't think you should have a second wedding either tbh. Just have the wedding you want and if anyone gets angry with you, tell them to worry about any wedding they have.", "NTA, but you should just plan the wedding you want.

This is the special event for you and SO, you do you.\n\nThat being said, if you're not especially religious or you don't think a church wedding is important... Then maybe it's time to not let a few people in your family dictate how you live your life. I am not Christian, but I know many Christian doctrines says he made everything so I can't fathom why they'd be offended by having a ceremony under their sky or whatever.", "YTA- to yourself. It\u2019s your life, and no is a complete sentence. Have the wedding you want, with the people you want and who are happy to celebrate with you. Why waste time and money and energy having a wedding you don\u2019t want, trying to appease people who aren\u2019t going to be happy anyway?", "NTA, but the church wedding silly if you\u2019re not a C3 yourself. Don\u2019t start your married life with a lie to keep the peace. Sometimes it\u2019s ok for unreasonable people to be upset. If they really love you, they\u2019ll come around.
