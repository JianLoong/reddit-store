The problem is not the gaming, not even how you guys split the household chores per se, it is that you and your husband can't seem to see eye to eye and communicate about anything, really. From your post, it sounds like that's mostly on him, but either way it's time to try to consider some options to improve things, like counseling \u2014 if you're both willing to work on your relationship. If not, then you owe it to yourself and to your kid to remove yourself from this toxic situation asap.", "NTA. Your husband is abusive toward you and neglectful of your baby. Even if you were a Stay-at-home-parent, you shouldn't need to take care of most of the child care. However, you both work...yet your husband demands you are always the one to get up when the baby needs something in the middle of the night, you are the one who needs to clean, you are the one who needs to take off of work, you are the one whose job is unimportant. \n\nYou don't need to just pause the game.

Does your husband bring anything to the table?  I'd be re-evaluating that relationship. The baby is 50% his responsibility, and while I understand that a lot of the caretaking falls on us as mothers, he should be making every effort to pitch in where he can. I get up with my daughter at night, and work full-time, too. Last night she was sick and up until 8am, when I woke up her dad and told him I needed sleep. I slept, got up and got ready, went to brunch, came home to a clean house, kissed the baby, and took a nap. God help my boyfriend if he dared to say a word about it. Although I'm sure he would've rathered watch football all day, he understands that the trade-off is him not needing to wake up every night with her. \n\nAlso - your need for sleep is a primal need. His preference to play video games isn't a biological requirement. He seems to be prioritizing his wants over your needs. I'm sorry you're dealing with that - parenting is hard enough when it's just a child you're taking care of.", "Okay, I though NTA with an unreasonable, abusive husband when I thought you were a stay-at-home mom.

But hindsight is 20/20, baby is here and a very lovely boy and the light of my life. It hurts my heart to think his father doesn\u2019t see him as a priority, as well as him possibly growing up to treat women the way his father treats me.

Anyway, I\u2019m really sorry for what you\u2019re going through.\n>\n>I had similar arguments with my wife when our daughter was a baby. Everything we had read said how important routines were, so I tried to to make sure she had very reliable routines, especially around food and bed times. I didn\u2019t understand why my wife thought it was ok to delay mealtimes sometimes by over an hour.\n\n>When I was \u201con duty\u201d, I would plan meals ahead of time so that she had food in front of her at the right time. When my wife was on duty, she would start to think about what she was going to make around the time the meal was supposed to happen.\n>\n>Anyway, we ended up doing couples counseling mainly for other reasons, but this came up too. Basically, it turned out she had been struggling with undiagnosed ADHD and depression.  Understanding the different ways our minds worked and our individual needs helped so much with everything in our marriage.\n>\n>So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for doing that in the moment, but I do think you need to try to figure out how to make long term progress with him, not just win short term battles. If he\u2019s will to do couples therapy, that could be super helpful like it was for us.\n>\n>Good luck!\n\n\nAlso, I\u2019ll add that I agree with the others who have said OP should just get out. I just think she should try counseling first and then get a divorce if that doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\nEdit: I can\u2019t reply because the post is locked, but I can edit my comment. u/eilykmai is probably right that OP\u2019s husband is just abusive and would not be open to counseling and may in fact weaponize it instead. I will say, though, that our counselor met with each of us individually in addition to as a couple. I would hope that that kind of arrangement might make it easier for the counselor to understand what\u2019s really going on and help guide OP to leave.", "NTA at ALL! Not even a little bit!

You both are in the military.**\n\nIt sounds like when it comes to the home life you are responsible for everything while your lazy, husband plays games and only takes breaks to insult and demean you. The fact that you have an office capacity and he works in the field is utterly irrelevant to the issues at hand his refusal to carry out any of the responsibilities that are his as a husband and father at home.\n\nYes, you were justified in doing what you are did, but you seem to only now be waking up to how abusive your husband is. Clearly you've grown a thick skin in a very short period of time.\n\nIf you had no choice, this would be a good thing, but you do have choices, but you need to get yourself together if you don't want to suffer long term emotional damage that will negatively impact your work performance. If that happens you won't have a source of confidence and end up powerless to control events anywhere and become a victim.\n\nFirst you need to recognize this goes far beyond simply not wanting to give your child a bath. His behavior is reprehensible across the board. It is a total failure on every level, and completely unjustified and as a member of the military unacceptable. The military expects and demands better from its members who are also fathers and spouses. That doesn't mean they babysit anyone, but it does mean when abusive spouses are brought to their attention you will have the authorities on your side.\n\nEven worse he doesn't seem to show you any spousal affection and sees you as a live-in maid whose job it is is to feed him, wash his clothes and keep the house clean and should you fall short on any of those his convenient verbal, personal punching bag. His constant insults and temper tantrums can be as damaging to you over the long-term as physical abuse, so you cannot dismiss the hurt and harm simply because he doesn't hit you.\n\n**LUCKY for you being in the military means you don't have to put up with him. The military is extremely disapproving of abusive spouses. NO excuses are acceptable for the way he is treating you ESPECIALLY** ***SINCE it is having a negative impact on your ability to do your job in the military.***\n\nIf you address this (ask them for help) now with your commanding officer I imagine they will start off by having  a heart to heart with your parasitic, selfish, abusive husband in which they will explain his behavior is NOT acceptable for a member of the military and if he doesn't shape up he will be ejected so that the military can preserve a productive member, you.\n\nOf course, I realize that might not be your goal, but it doesn't have to be. What you need is something to shake your husband up and shape up in order to carry out his responsibilities of a parent and husband in the military married to a higher ranking individual and a good talking to could do that.\n\nGood luck. :-)", "NTA but things need to change, your husband is hurting you with his behavior, and as your son gets older he's going to be affected too.", "NTA.

My husband told me that I was annoying and needy, and that I didn\u2019t know what anxiety was. He again ignored my calls and texts while I was home alone with our son for 3 months.

And OP, your partner is abusive..\n\nWhile there can be benefits for couples who undergo couple\u2019s therapy, there\u2019s a great risk for any person who is being abused to attend therapy with their abusive partner.\n\nRelationship counseling can help partners understand each other, resolve difficult problems, and even help the couple gain a different perspective on their situation. It cannot, however, fix the unequal power structure that is characteristic of an abusive relationship.\n\nAn abuser may use what is said in therapy later against their partner. Therapy can make a person feel vulnerable. If the abuser is embarrassed or angered by something said in therapy, he or she may make their partner suffer to gain back the sense of control. Therapy is often considered a \u201csafe space\u201d for people to talk. For an abused partner, that safety doesn\u2019t necessarily extend to their home.\n\nCouples often enter couple\u2019s therapy to fix their relationship. Deciding whether or not the relationship is better is extremely hard for a couple if one is being abused. The abuser has all of the power and can no longer gauge if a relationship is getting better because he/she does not see what their partner sees. The abused partner often cannot even rate how bad or good the relationship is because the abuse has affected him/her.\n\nAnother reason that couple\u2019s therapy or counseling is not recommended is that the facilitator may not know about the abuse, which would make the entire process ineffective. The abuser may make their partner seem responsible for the problems, and if the therapist does not realize that abuse is present, her or she may believe the abuser.\n\nObviously NTA.", "I can\u2019t put all the facts on Reddit for fear a friend of mine might recognize my post and potentially report it to my superiors or his.

I\u2019d love for him to be spending his time with someone else so he could just leave me the hell alone.", "File a police report as well", "BETTER TO RUIN HIS CAREER THAN YOUR LIFE!!!", "Op.\n\nYou have to do what's best for your kid. Not your husband, hopefully soon ex. \n\nThat's your priority. Not protecting that man's name or career. He has already shown that he'll make it as hard for you as possible and won't refrain from using this thing he has on you supposedly. \n\nThat's my 2 cents anyway, you do you.", "He did a household chore! A miracle!", "Holy shit. Okay first of all I asked about WoW because in the WoW world (that has both created and destroyed committed relationships) it\u2019s simply called \u201cthe game\u201d. So the particular vernacular caught me wondering.\n\nBut holy shit. People are offering lots of great advice in the thread. I don\u2019t have anything better than their wisdom but I do want to say I am sorry. Being a mom is hard as fuck even when you have a committed and present partner. I don\u2019t care what anyone says\u2014just as it is incredibly beautiful and fulfilling motherhood just sucks the life out of you. And you learn how to keep adapting and changing so you can be a whole person while also constantly giving your whole life to these babies. But I am sorry\u2014the husband should be an equal partner, not yet another human you have to take care of and keep alive.\n\nYou deserve better, OP. I hope you are able to figure your situation out. I know it\u2019s easier said than done but I hope it includes not him. At least not unless he actually changes after you leave him, but that doesn\u2019t sound hopeful. I guess we\u2019ll see.\n\nEdit: I just realized that the husband is leaving and that seems like the best outcome. From my limited outside view, obviously.", "You stood up for your self once, because he is always an AH. \n\nHe threatened divorce, because he is a AH. \n\nIt seems like you know it's time to plan your exit.

If you can get it out in the open he can't use it against you.", "Basically, it just reinforces other abusers. When I worked in a couple of DV shelters a judge still insisted this should be a thing still. He was asked why do have the lowest conviction rate of abusers of any judge in the state and this is a state notorious for coddling abusers.

Clear cut, blatant abuse, and you need to get *out*. *Fast.* I don't even think I need to say NTA, that goes without saying. Seriously, you need to get you and your child as far away from this man as possible. Making threats like that, he isn't just verbally abusive, he could very well end up actually violently lashing out and hurt you, or even the child some day. Please, OP, for the safety of both of you, leave this man. I'm scared for you.

It's great bonding time for us.\n\nI also cook and keep the kitchen clean. My wife does the clothes washing. When he's asleep I play video games. Sometimes that means I don't play any video games if he doesn't want to go down.\n\nWhat I do is the bare minimum.\n\nWhat I do is somewhat fair, most of the time.\n\nCan you imagine anything like that from your partner?\n\nNTA and you deserve better.", "NTA I can\u2019t believe you even have to ask, you\u2019ve done nothing wrong and your husband is verbally abusive to you.
