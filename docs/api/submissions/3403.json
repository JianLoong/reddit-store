Even if you were a Stay-at-home-parent, you shouldn't need to take care of most of the child care.

Does your husband bring anything to the table?  I'd be re-evaluating that relationship. The baby is 50% his responsibility, and while I understand that a lot of the caretaking falls on us as mothers, he should be making every effort to pitch in where he can. I get up with my daughter at night, and work full-time, too. Last night she was sick and up until 8am, when I woke up her dad and told him I needed sleep. I slept, got up and got ready, went to brunch, came home to a clean house, kissed the baby, and took a nap. God help my boyfriend if he dared to say a word about it. Although I'm sure he would've rathered watch football all day, he understands that the trade-off is him not needing to wake up every night with her. \n\nAlso - your need for sleep is a primal need. His preference to play video games isn't a biological requirement. He seems to be prioritizing his wants over your needs. I'm sorry you're dealing with that - parenting is hard enough when it's just a child you're taking care of.", "Okay, I though NTA with an unreasonable, abusive husband when I thought you were a stay-at-home mom.

But hindsight is 20/20, baby is here and a very lovely boy and the light of my life.

Everything we had read said how important routines were, so I tried to to make sure she had very reliable routines, especially around food and bed times. I didn\u2019t understand why my wife thought it was ok to delay mealtimes sometimes by over an hour.\n\n>When I was \u201con duty\u201d, I would plan meals ahead of time so that she had food in front of her at the right time. When my wife was on duty, she would start to think about what she was going to make around the time the meal was supposed to happen.\n>\n>Anyway, we ended up doing couples counseling mainly for other reasons, but this came up too. Basically, it turned out she had been struggling with undiagnosed ADHD and depression.  Understanding the different ways our minds worked and our individual needs helped so much with everything in our marriage.\n>\n>So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for doing that in the moment, but I do think you need to try to figure out how to make long term progress with him, not just win short term battles.

As far as everything else goes, I could\u2019ve let him play his game and take care of the baby myself, but given the history, I wanted him to understand that it\u2019s a team effort and I\u2019m to be respected as well, and that he needs to learn to prioritize.", "That's just downright abusive and honey you need to run omg so much nta", "NTA your husband is abusive.

You both are in the military.**\n\nIt sounds like when it comes to the home life you are responsible for everything while your lazy, husband plays games and only takes breaks to insult and demean you. The fact that you have an office capacity and he works in the field is utterly irrelevant to the issues at hand his refusal to carry out any of the responsibilities that are his as a husband and father at home.\n\nYes, you were justified in doing what you are did, but you seem to only now be waking up to how abusive your husband is. Clearly you've grown a thick skin in a very short period of time.\n\nIf you had no choice, this would be a good thing, but you do have choices, but you need to get yourself together if you don't want to suffer long term emotional damage that will negatively impact your work performance. If that happens you won't have a source of confidence and end up powerless to control events anywhere and become a victim.\n\nFirst you need to recognize this goes far beyond simply not wanting to give your child a bath. His behavior is reprehensible across the board. It is a total failure on every level, and completely unjustified and as a member of the military unacceptable. The military expects and demands better from its members who are also fathers and spouses. That doesn't mean they babysit anyone, but it does mean when abusive spouses are brought to their attention you will have the authorities on your side.\n\nEven worse he doesn't seem to show you any spousal affection and sees you as a live-in maid whose job it is is to feed him, wash his clothes and keep the house clean and should you fall short on any of those his convenient verbal, personal punching bag. His constant insults and temper tantrums can be as damaging to you over the long-term as physical abuse, so you cannot dismiss the hurt and harm simply because he doesn't hit you.\n\n**LUCKY for you being in the military means you don't have to put up with him. The military is extremely disapproving of abusive spouses. NO excuses are acceptable for the way he is treating you ESPECIALLY** ***SINCE it is having a negative impact on your ability to do your job in the military.***\n\nIf you address this (ask them for help) now with your commanding officer I imagine they will start off by having  a heart to heart with your parasitic, selfish, abusive husband in which they will explain his behavior is NOT acceptable for a member of the military and if he doesn't shape up he will be ejected so that the military can preserve a productive member, you.\n\nOf course, I realize that might not be your goal, but it doesn't have to be. What you need is something to shake your husband up and shape up in order to carry out his responsibilities of a parent and husband in the military married to a higher ranking individual and a good talking to could do that.\n\nGood luck. :-)", "NTA but things need to change, your husband is hurting you with his behavior, and as your son gets older he's going to be affected too.", "NTA.

Maybe find someone who loves you and your kid as their own and will treat you with respect.", "I hope you thanked him....", "Take him up on it. He will be doing you a favor. What are you getting out of this abusive relationship anyway?? You're doing it all anyway", "Bonus: you're both military it sounds like so you know he will actually have some accountability. \n\nBut this is probably the best that could happen. He sounds abusive as hell and it will only get worse if you stay\n\nAlso congrats on the promotion!\n\nEdit: spelling", "OP, it\u2019s time to let the trash take itself out.", " You already make more than him and do everything in the house. He will regret it and realize what he lost, but for the love of god don\u2019t go back to him.", "I was gunna say divorce that man but nvm he beat me to it anyway you and your son deserve better I hope for a great life for you 2", "OP THIS. The game is just a red herring here.  The real issue is that your husband is a good for nothing, lazy, entitled, immature, jealous, and disrespectful child rather than a full partner. Please think long and hard about what you're actually getting out of this relationship. From this post, it doesn't seem like much of anything positive. NTA", "A few things here:\n\nFirst off, NTA. Obviously. \n\nSecond: you\u2019re dual military and he\u2019s acting like he\u2019s the only one who\u2019s working. He\u2019s clearly unable to cope with your success, not to mention you\u2019re basically cleaning up after two children. The fact you made it to E5 with all this madness is amazing, so I applaud you. \n\nThird, and possibly the biggest point here: this relationship is concerning me a lot. He threatened to BREAK YOUR PHONE? I\u2019m BH in the military, and this stuff escalates. Consider couples counseling (unsure he\u2019ll be on board) or think about\u2026 ways to get out. I know it\u2019s not what you want to hear with a young baby and being military, I\u2019m assuming your family isn\u2019t nearby, but seriously, find a way to become independent of this man and find your way. \n\nI wish you and your baby the best.", "Never mind that she's two pay grades above him, so her job brings in more $$.", "NTA I\u2019m sorry this is happening. I think leaving will be your best bet", "DONT THINK RUN FORREST RUN", "His appetite, I would guess. Lazy sod.\n\nNTA-. Throw the whole man out.", "He can ask his supervisor to take the time to stay home so I can go to work and be productive - he CHOOSES not to. He doesn\u2019t believe my job is important enough to warrant us splitting the time to care for sick baby.", "He literally cannot stop you. Go.", "This man is abusing you! Threatening to keep your son if you leave him is abuse, beyond the many other red flags here. Document your unequal contributions, and contact a divorce lawyer.", "Why? It\u2019s not like he\u2019s spending any time with or taking care of your son at all.", "He's not going to be able to do this. He threatening you bc he knows this is your biggest fear. You need a good lawyer and documentation. Not strangers on the internet telling you what you already know", "Before you listen to your husband about what he\u2019ll \u201callow\u201d you to do, listen to a lawyer about what the law says you can do. I think you\u2019ll find you have a lot more power than you think you do right now.", "Okay valid to want to know but a little rude! A more pressing question might be: are you thinking of staying with him? Why? It doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s a benefit to your life.", "You're not on a team. You're on an island by yourself. Good luck.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like it worked though, he showed zero respect for you. You are NTA for pausing his game, but that\u2019s not going to uplevel him to even a mediocre partner or parent.", "We give him a bath every single night because he gets sick A LOT, like more than the average kiddo does at his age. Also, he\u2019s had the same routine since he was 3 months old and it works for us. He sleeps longer and deeper, wakes up less, and understands that it\u2019s bedtime so it\u2019s not a fight to put him down. We lotion a lot, don\u2019t worry, and he enjoys bath-time. Just what works for him.", "I figured there would be at least one ESH comment. I agree, I am a little bitter. I work hard every single day, more than I should be mentally or physically capable of, and I never ask for gratitude or praise. I\u2019ve simply asked him to do his part, and he never does without putting up a fight. I love my husband very much, always have despite how he treats me, and it hurts my heart to have to talk to him like he\u2019s 5, but I am trying to get him to see things from both perspectives. It doesn\u2019t work obviously. Tried to talk about marriage counseling, and he doesn\u2019t take me seriously about it.", "We are both Navy. I just hit my 3 year mark November 14th and got promoted to E-5 day before thanksgiving. My husband has been in for 2 years.", "Unfortunately this is very real.", "THIS - wonderful! Looks like the trash wants to take himself out.", "THIS. OP, your life may actually become easier once you dump this worthless man.", "He bought a $500 Ps5 and $300 Nintendo Switch, as well has a PC that he plays on. So he spends a shit ton of money on video games. I got a peek at his bank account once and he legit spends like $500 on games every 2 weeks.", "THIS right here. And I wouldn't waste any more energy on making him give your baby baths or do anything else. Not worth the stress and frustration on your part. I'd just work on getting out and into your own space ASAP.", "Definitely go to FAP, they can help you navigate this especially since you said he wants a divorce. They can help get you the needed resources, education for him and pull his command to require him to participate if they feel his behaviors meet abusive criteria or neglect, which from what I\u2019ve seen they do meet the minimum. They\u2019re there to support you. NPSP is new parent support and most branches have them and they do home visits to do hands in education in a space where parents tend to be more comfortable. He may be more receptive this way.", "You'd also get higher priority for placement as a single parent, and lower rate. Also child support will come directly from his check, so he can't stiff you.", "He believes my home state is \u201cdangerous\u201d and looks down on my family members as hillbillies. He simply told me I wouldn\u2019t be taking his son anywhere.", "Yeah, I figured he\u2019d have the reaction he did. I just wanted to stand up for myself for once, even if he didn\u2019t take me seriously or care. It was an important choice for me.", "Totally NTA, but just a heads up - more frequent baths doesn\u2019t help to reduce chances of getting sick", "Your husband doesn't respect you. He isn't even kind to you. \n\nHe claims you don't do anything so that he can pre-emptivey deflect attention from everything he doesn't do (and doesn't want to do).\n\nHe resents taking care of his own child for even a few hours a week.\n\nThis isn't something counseling will fix. \n\nIf you stay in this relationship, you're teaching your son that this is how he should treat you and every important woman in his life. I hope that helps put things in perspective.", "Watch how quickly he'll start taking you seriously when you file for divorce. I can tell you from experience, mine and that of the countless women who have posted on this sub about similar issues, he will not change. He has it made right now aside from you asking him to pull his weight. You're taking care of him, the home, and your baby and he gets to come home and sit on his ass, gaming. He's waiting for you to give up and stop asking. \n\nAt this point, you'd be better off single. You're already doing everything and you're still getting bitched at if you don't meet his standards. At least as a single parent, you wouldn't have to clean up after him or fight with him just for him to still refuse to do anything. \n\nGood luck!", "It doesn\u2019t get any easier from here. Go pick up the book,\u201dhow to not hate your husband after kids\u201d [book](https://www.amazon.com/Hate-Your-Husband-After-Kids/dp/0316267104/ref=nodl_?dplnkId=3571a529-62db-4fa5-96fc-0063b6cf343a)  and ask if he\u2019s willing to work on being a better husband and father.\n\nYou two really need to come together and work on this as a couple or else you\u2019re headed for rough roads.", "If you guys have separate bank accounts, (if you can) make sure all the baby's needs come from your account. It'll show you are the main provider and therefore you can have a better footing on requesting financial support from him. \n\nAs others have said, he's given you a great gift by \"suddenly\" being \"sick of your sh**\"", "YIKES! Can you please explain why you're with him???", "Sounds like you need to find a lawyer as an urgent priority.", "Good girl. I'm proud of you. Now follow through honey. I know it may seem scary and overwhelming but you will be sooooo much better off in the long run. Set an example for your son. And give him a loving home he deserves. Oh and take every penny the best lawyer you can afford will get you!! Cuz you know he won't do 50-50 custody. NTA. Keep us posted!", "I\u2019m aware. When I mean by him getting frequently sick is all the boogers/snotty nose, him blowing out his diapers when he has a virus, and the occasional vomiting when he\u2019s not feeling great. Also, we have two cats and an in-house litter box. We both vape (outside of the house of course) and he goes to daycare 5 days a week. That\u2019s why we give baths every night", "Gotcha!! That makes sense"]}
