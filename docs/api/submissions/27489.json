Once I felt like I had at least some of my bearings on parenthood, I offered to take over completely on week nights, while he does mornings before work + weekends. It's a collaborative process and that breakdown of parenting just made sense to me. My husband was the one leaving our home to work every day, he was the one who had to be up by a specific time and make a drive.\n\nAt 4 months, we no longer have this obstacle anymore (and to be honest, I kind of miss the sweet, quiet bonding time those extra night feeds provided now that he's settled onto a nice sleep schedule and usually only wakes up once.)

This is an experience no biological man will ever have.\n\nWith saying this is I don't think she is coming to you to solve her problems she is coming to you as she wants someone to listen to her vent etc.  She is hormonal and emotional and though some of your ideas are pretty good she doesn't want them.\n\nI'm only going ESH cause your sister is an AH to herself for not taking up your offer of babysitting.  To be honest be good for both of yous to have a night off baby duty every once and a while.\n\nBut your also an AH for belittling your sister.

Just because you are a parent doesn't mean you've been through what your sister's been through and know all the answers. Unfortunately that's the way your post reads.\n\nShe is going through major physical and hormonal changes. You haven't experienced this. Even as a woman I had easier post-natal experiences than many and wouldn't pretend to know what another mother was feeling/experiencing. If she says she's scared that she'll fall asleep holding the baby, validate her very real fear. That does happen to parents and can be deadly.\n\nAlso, every baby is different. As a parent of multiple children I can't emphasize this enough. You did not \"get it down to a perfect science\" with your baby. You got lucky that you have an easy baby who sleeps through the night at a very young age. \n\nIt was kind of you to offer to watch her baby. I imagine her lack of appreciation for this offer was based on feeling judged. Even if she appreciated it, she'd likely have turned it down, though. Most parents would be uncomfortable handing their child off to someone else so young. Next time try listening and empathy, rather than solutions.", "YTA.

That isn\u2019t practical if she is breastfeeding. She can\u2019t hand you her baby for 3-4 days. It just doesn\u2019t work that way.

My sister nearly died giving birth and it took her a good six months to physically recover - thank goodness her baby was a good sleeper so that she could recover that fast. My first, I had severe complications that had me bedridden for three months, and still in excruciating pain and bad anemia afterwards.

You don\u2019t.", "When I was born, my parents lived in the middle of nowhere in Montana, and my dad had to drive at least 45 minutes to work Monday-Friday. And guess what? He got up to do one of the night feeds (I was allergic to my mom's breastmilk so I had to be fed with formula) ***and*** he would take over parenting duty once he got home from work. Your sister is going through a bunch of crap that you, as a man, are literally unable to experience. She was right, you couldn't empathize with her or give her \"valuable tips\" since she had been pregnant and gave birth but you didn't. So you cannot tell her to basically suck it because you lived through it so she can. ***YOU*** are not still recovering from a significant medical event, ***you*** are not having to deal with your hormones being entirely significant issues out of whack, and most of all ***you*** are not at risk of post-partum depression, post-partum anxiety, or any other post-partum mental health issues. To quote Rachel Green: \"No uterus, no opinion\"", "YTA because your situations are not similar enough for your experience to map onto hers. Her body is still recovering from pregnancy and childbirth, so her sleeping needs are different. Also, your husband is not her husband. Many men whose wives are SAHMs do not expect to do any childcare whatsoever. You described your husband helping in the morning and evenings. Does her husband do that? If he stays up late of his own accord (gaming, watching TV, etc), it might actually make more sense for him to do a night feeding rather than evening. And third, your baby is not her baby. Even within families, babies often have different sleep patterns and some sleep better than others. I would say that you jumped to giving advice when maybe what she needs is to vent. The fact that you did not intend to be malicious does not change the fact that she received it that way, something that happens literally all the time in human interactions. Focusing on your intent is the wrong move here.", "NTA. You have good intentions and I agree with you that the one parent staying at home would take the night feedings shift.\n\nThere is a real risk that this man driving in 45 minutes commute would fall asleep.\n\nThe only thing I can object is that you didn't consider your sister recovering from giving birth.", "YTA", "I tried my best when my first was born to do it all. I felt like since I was on maternity leave and my husband was working that his test was more valuable than mine. One day I went to him in tears apologizing that I couldn't do all of the night feeds but I was so exhausted and needed help. He stared at me for a few seconds and said \"...okay? Tell me which feed you want me to do.\" I'd made such a huge deal of it in my head and in reality he just shrugged and was fine. With my second I did not try to do it all. We split the load from the beginning. \n\nI don't agree with you but I can understand your thought process because it was mine at first too. As far as \"sleep when the baby sleeps,\"  my first would not nap unless I held her, and even then it was for maybe an hour. Even as a newborn. While that advice is well intentioned it just does not work for some situations. The fourth trimester is HARD. Hormones are a dumpster fire, PPD/PPA are brutal.

Your sister is recovering from birth, so your experiences are not the same. She's likely far more exhausted and tired than either you or your wife are.

Our hormones are all over the place, and we're healing from birthing a tiny human. We're expected to just pop up not even 24 hours after all that and keep going like nothing happened.  The sleepless nights and the nerve-wracking nights of a baby that can't be soothed no matter what you do takes a huge toll. She's crying out for help. She needs it. Postpartum depression is nothing to play with. Her situation and yours do not mirror each other, and to belittle her was the worst thing you could do. If her husband isn't willing to help, then reach out to her and assist her with getting help. My husband works 12 hour shifts 6 days a week, and he still helped me with the nighttime feeds.

News flash, not all babies are the same - in fact, they're all different. You also never had to go the the physical healing she did (which by the way she isn't finished healing from at 4m pp, after 8-9 months of being ill and in pain.

It was the hardest time of my life, and I still carry substantial resentment for my partner over it (in therapy!). This is a much deeper problem that you\u2019re realizing. Please make sure she is getting screened for PPD and ensure she has adequate support. \n\nOffering to watch her baby during the day so she can sleep during is kind, but how you offer makes a big difference. Approach it from a place of concern for her well-being and do it gently. It probably also makes her feel bad that the person who should be supporting her and their baby is refusing to help, and she\u2019s just taking out some resentment on your offer. \n\nHer partner should absolutely be helping at night\u2014you\u2019re way off base there. A close family member volunteered to stay overnight 1x weekly for me during the early months because I was falling apart. She did so just by saying she would love to spend time with my kiddo and that I could catch up on sleep that night. Words can\u2019t express how much that meant to me. \n\nI feel deeply for your sister. Offer her support, not judgement. Light a fire under her husband\u2019s ass.", "She should be doing like you and letting him sleep and just getting up a half hour earlier with the baby IF it's needed, but I don't understand how it would be unless she's dealing with postpartum .... sometimes women with postpartum just can't deal and need to see their Dr for something to make sure they're OK... could that be it?

Good for you that taking all the night feedings and whatever works for you and your husband. It's not working for your sister and she deserves that support from her husband.

I fell asleep while feeding her and dropped my infant.  So yeah, it can happen.  There is a huge difference between 2 hour naps and a 5 hour stretch.  Also, your sister is still postpartum with hormones changing and all that compounds her feelings.  You do not.  Yours and her experiences are not equivalent.  You do sound holier than thou.

Do you know who IS? Your SISTER, and certainly your SURROGATE, who I'm sure you haven't bothered to care about after you got what you wanted from her. Your experiences are NOT the same. Breastfeeding babies can certainly feel like they're draining the life out of you. Can you imagine how it feels to KNOW that your baby needs to feed off of your body, so you need to stay well fed and well hydrated, but you're too TIRED to take care of yourself, so you're stuck with terrible guilt and depression that's amplified by the hormones? She deserves 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep a few times a week AT LEAST. YOU should see that. Her HUSBAND should see that. Then, even if she gets that help, those pesky hormones will amplify things AGAIN and make her feel even more guilty and inadequate for WANTING to get more sleep. Mom's can't win that battle.

Obviously a man can never experience the post- partum aspects of childbirth, and will never understand, but the level of condescension from some of you people astounds me.  I know that it's hard to sometimes convey tone through words but this is a place to inform.  Some of you it just seems like you're out to belittle and demean.  Explain it in an insightful and thoughtful way.  It's always good to remind men about these things, but especially with being a gay male couple with surrogacy, their experience was vastly different.  I must imagine doctors inform heterosexual couples about postpartum and all the nasty potential side effects of pregnancy so both husband and wife know what to potentially expect.
