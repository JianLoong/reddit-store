That being said, unless the bedroom you're in is too small for two people and all their bedroom things, this logic simply doesn't apply.\n\nAlso, anyone who needs full-time mobility equipment knows how much space it takes up.

Wow dude, giant red flag.  \n\nShe just moved into your home, after you had made a selfless decision for the benefit of your disabled child, and your wife can only think about how she wants more space?!  \n\nI think you need to have a very serious talk with your wife about your life goals.", "NTA, but dude... are you sure that you want to be married woth someone that threw a fit because she's not sleeping in the master bedroom and has no empathy/understanding of the needs of a disabled person?", "NTA. But damn, this is not a great start to a marriage. Bringing in a stepmom is hard but when you have a child with a disability, you have to vet that person like they're getting top top govt security clearance. Did you do that? Do you really know what this woman thinks about your son and disability?

If not I'm afraid she probably needs to go", "Nta. I don't have Cebral Palsy bit I have a physical disability. A master bedroom is so much easier to adapt for support then other bedroom.  He has a greater need to have it.", "NTA for not moving your son out of a room which has been modified to accommodate his needs\n\nI do question how you wound up married to someone who is such a selfish entitled woman.\n\nIt is generally assumed that the parents will have the master bedroom because it is generally the largest with the most closet space and generally in modern homes has an ensuite. \n\nBut that isn't the \"law\" - just what is generally done in typical families where there are parents and children. In some families an older person might be living with them and that person might have the master bedroom and en suite.

Either your wife has always been a selfish, narcissistic a-hole, or something else is going on.  You said she just moved in.  Is it like, now that the idea of living with your son has been transferred into a reality, she\u2019s completely overwhelmed and not sure she\u2019s up for this living situation and/or this relationship and she\u2019s just choosing this particular issue to focus on?  \n\nShe might not want to tell you because she\u2019s afraid to say, \u201cWhoa.  I totally underestimated how much of my life is going to have to change if I live with a man with a handicapped child and I\u2019m not sure if I can deal,\u201d because she\u2019s afraid that will make her sound \u201cbad\u201d.

Your kid comes first.", "NTA\n\nPeople with physical disabilities need accomodations. In your scenario, the master bedroom accommodated your son's needs the best. He should get that room simply for that reason. The master bedroom is not just about status, which your wife seems to think it is. Yes, in most cases, the owners of the house get the biggest room often with a bathroom attached. But, sometimes sacrifices have to be made to accommodate someone with special needs. She's making this about status and herself. Hopefully, she'll come to realize how little it matters what room she's in as long as you both can still be happy. I'm assuming you would be sharing the room with her. That should be enough.", "Info: did you explain this to your wife before she moved in/married you? \n\nYou're NTA for making sure that your son has the room that works for his needs.

My daughter has the master in my house. 1- she has way more clothes than me so the two closets work for her 2- she loves baths I love showers 3- I do not care about decor and she designed out decor. I just need a bed, a closet and a bathroom and I am good. Your son has a disability and the room is already set up for that disability. When my late husband was alive she had the master than too because we did not really care and she was his princess lol.", "Esh, only reason im going with that is for this should have been discussed prior to marriage and moving in. Your wife shouldn\u2019t have found out about this from your niece while moving in. \n\nYour wife is using an excuse to kick your son out of his room for her inconvenience. It is your son room and been made to meet his needs.

Has she been bothering you about it continuously these past few months or was it just the one incident you've described when she moved in?\n\nBecause on one hand your son legitimately needs his room and you're not an AH for refusing to switch rooms. However your wife is correct that in most cases the expectation is that the parents/married couple get the master bedroom. Since it doesn't sound like you told her about the bedroom situation beforehand, I can totally understand her feeling upset and mislead. It's kind of an AH move to not have told her the situation before she moved in so that she could adjust expectations and/or get any concerns she had addressed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your child has very real needs, and his needs need to precede whatever her misbegotten notion is about what room she deserves to live in.
