Yeah no shit, I would prioritize myself too. Tell them to come to the UK if they care so much. NTA", "NAH. You have your own family which is and should be your priority. You've made summer travel plans and don't have leave available.\n\nYour oarents mistake was not bringing this up sooner; it could've been your family summer vacation", "NTA.  Life is busy with kids and work so I understand not wanting to use precious vacation time to visit people you don't know.\n\nIf you were able to go for just a weekend, would your parents pay your way since you're going mainly to accompany them?\n\nHow does your brother feel about going since he's already done it once?  Does he feel it's now your turn?\n\nIf neither of you can go and it prevents your parents from making the trip, that's unfortunate but if they are unable to travel alone (and many couples do so, even in their 80s) that's the stage they're at.   Maybe their Netherland's family can visit them this time.\n\nIn any case, NTA.", "NAH. If you don\u2019t want to go don\u2019t go. You\u2019re an adult. Your parents are justified to think what they think if you don\u2019t go because you are their child and they want you there, and that\u2019s something you guys need to sort out privately. You are NTA for prioritizing your family and situation, and your parents are NTA for wanting you to come.", "You can spend your holidays as you wish. You also may not have this opportunity again. You won\u2019t know if you enjoy these newfound family members if you don\u2019t spend time with them. Decide what your priorities are and follow that path. Just bear in mind that time is finite for everyone. \n\nNAH", "NTA\n\nIt's not like they are close family!\n\nYou have your own things to do in life as well.\n\nNo has to be the answer if you don't have enough holiday entitlement and already have things planned for this year.\n\nMaybe these distant relatives could spend a bit of cash and come to your family in the UK, it all seems a bit one sided", "NTA - As with most people you only have a limited amount of money and holidays. So you need to prioritise. I feel that this is a completely legit priority", "NTA there is nothing wrong with you prioritising your immediate family to begin with but add on top of that work, finances and kids to juggle, nah dude it's YOUR life, your time, your money do with it as you please.\nIf your parents want this so badly they can help take some of these issues off of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
