Her reaction seems disproportionate to the situation. It is true that if she's talking to a guy and you interject, it can come off as jealous behavior, but it seems so innocent in this situation.

She couldn't get a dude's number while your back was turned or something?", "NTA. That\u2019s super weird on her part.", "NTA", "NTA.  She cares more about the guy's feelings than yours, and she doesn't want you interrupting when another guy is talking to her because she doesn't want him to know she's in a relationship.", "Nta. It sounds like you maybe interrupted a mini flirt session and she blamed it on you because she was enjoying the conversation or attention.", "NAH but do some self reflection, her assumption may be unfounded, but she knows you well\u2026. Then just think about it. It\u2019s really likely that after four months since birthing she is starting to feel attractive again\u2026. Foster that\u2026 you will all win if you jump on the making her feel attractive bandwagon.", "NTA. Don\u2019t worry about it. Look, just today my husband accidentally stole someone\u2019s parking spot. He felt really bad about it when he realized as they drove off angrily. Crap happens, one more person on earth thinks you\u2019re an AH. They won\u2019t be the last, whether you realize it or not.", "Bruh...", "NTA.\n\nYou were asking an innocent question. If the guy had a problem with it, then it makes you wonder what his intentions were.", "This just feels like so much overthinking", "NTA- you didn't even know she was chatting with anyone so how exactly did you put any controlling thoughts into your question, which was a perfectly innocent and socially acceptable question by the way. I think your gf was letting this guy think she was single.", "NTA\nYou just asked her if she wanted sugar in her coffee. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.  You needed info, specifically about the issue of sugar.  You were right to ask.  We're getting into some really weird social paradigms when a boyfriend is supposed to think, \"I'd better not speak to GF so as not to ruin her chances to speak to other men\".  Forget that.  GF is reading way, way, *way* too much between the lines here.", "How do you not know how your SO has her coffee after being together for a year?", "She doesn't think I'm an asshole. She just said it came across to strangers that I might be one of those 'alpha males' who need to possess their partners.", "She was in an abusive relationship previously and I think that was something that would happen. She was suggesting it as a possible interpretation of the guy as he completely backed away from talking to her.", "She's not like that. I was wondering why he stopped talking to her very suddenly.  She explained that he may have felt that I was calling attention to them interacting. She's been in a previous abusive relationship. She said that it was perceived by the guy that I might be possessive and was calling him out for talking to her. I had no idea that was a thing.", "It's me that was concerned about it. She just indicated a possible reason for him to stop talking to her so abruptly.", "This was her point. The fact that we have a son and we've been together so long. And I was louder than I thought I was, I guess? That maybe it was seen by the guy that I was calling out their conversation to the entire coffee shop.\n\nShe usually drinks tea and I know how she likes her tea. Some take their coffee differently.", "She doesn't have an issue. I have been dwelling on the guys reaction. It was so abrupt but her explanation makes me feel like a real asshole. I don't want her thinking I'm like her abusive ex. Even if she is too polite to suggest such a thing. I also don't want to repeat the behaviour if it is taken up that way", "I never thought that it could be seen as Jealousy. It was his behaviour that confused me. She was relaxed about the situation and suggested that because the man didn't know me, he may have thought I shouted across the shop because I noticed them talking. She was in an abusive relationship previously and he did get possessive.", "It was his behaviour I was confused about. He very suddenly stopped talking to her after I asked her. She said that one reason might have been that he thought I was the possessive type. She knows I'm not the jealous type but I can't control what a stranger might think", "I don't think she is. Our son is 4months old and she moved to my country when things got serious.  She has been in an abusive relationship before now and I worry that I was the AH, repeating negative experiences she had in that relationship.", "I have no fear about that tbh. She moved countries for us to be together. I would hope that wouldn't happen. She's not mad about it. I was the one that kept bringing up the guys behaviour.  Now I'm worried I was an AH. She was in an abusive relationship before and I don't want to repeat behaviours that she has experienced before. I hope that makes sense", "She's usually a tea drinker. She doesn't often drink coffee and some people take the 2 drinks differently. That's why I asked. I had no idea it might be taken up in such a way though...", "Nope, she's way overreacting. That's like, a ridiculous reach. You asked her if she wanted sugar because . . . you literally wanted to know if you should put sugar in her coffee. Honestly, I'm autistic, so I get why you worried, but this is one of those situations where the neurotypical person was being ridiculous and reading WAY too much into it. Sometimes a question is just a question.", "The fact that you are even asking this question in Reddit shows a clear lack of communication and understanding between you and your wife.", "If your side of the story is accurate then NTA and she's kind of overreacting, but your explanation about her previous relationship might explain that. However, I'm not sure why the guy felt that he had to stop talking to her as soon as you said that, unless he WAS trying to chat her up.", "I think there are men that would do what you're describing as a means of \"pissing on their property\" to make sure the other guy knew she wasn't available. Doesn't make anyone an AH here. Maybe the guy *was* talking to her with the intention of flirting and he stopped because he realized she was taken. In which case, it worked out.", "Don\u2019t worry, my husband and I have been married 13 years and it\u2019s still a mystery what either of us will want at a coffee shop on any given trip. Gotta shake things up in your day sometimes, right?!", "Yeah, I think especially with the use of the word \"Honey.\" Imagine a TV scene where a guy is talking to a pretty woman and then another guy shows up and kisses her just to make it clear he owns her. That's the kind of image she means, and pet names are a way of announcing to the store that she's your partner, but again it all sounds really innocent and like you didn't do anything wrong.", "Oh, so she wasn't actually annoyed with you for it? Then it's not really an AITA question", "Honestly, if she's suggesting that he reacted that way because of you asking, then she's a bit of an AH. No one is responsible for his behaviour but him. If he was looking to hit on her and he was put off because your asking about her coffee with an endearment (\"Honey\") made it clear that you were together, then it still doesn't make you an AH or \"possessive\". And she's an AH for even suggesting that it would. If he was put off by the realisation that she wasn't single, then that's a him problem, not anything that you did wrong. Period.", "Well, good. Then I hope the two of you can talk this through when the feelings aren't racing. You at least sound very considerate. Good luck!", "If his side of the story is accurate, there's no way he could possibly be the AH. Why even post this question? Feel like the only reason to post this is if he really was trying to interrupt, be controlling, and is now trying to justify it.", "That seems insane to me that he would react that way. She is more than able to handle herself and I wouldn't need to step in. I just didn't think such a simple question could be perceived in that way. I'm confused and a little upset that anyone might see me as controlling.", "Yo me it was innocent, to her it was innocent but I couldn't get over or explain his sudden reaction. I guess you see it in movies but I didn't think that stuff happened irl.", "No, she's not annoyed. She was trying to suggest an explanation for his behaviour and it made me feel like a total asshole. I'm a little concerned that I am since I interrupted an innocent interaction.", "I don't you're the asshole at all. But I will say people who have been in abusive relationships often develop sensitivities that can seem irrational from the outside. When you go through traumatic events you learn to become hyper attuned to danger signs. Those instincts are helpful while you're in the dangerous situation, but maladaptive outside of it. The fucker is they don't go away. It's the reason a lot of vets don't enjoy fireworks. The hindbrain doesn't get the message that the context has changed. If your girlfriend is carrying trauma from past abuse, she's going to react to certain things in ways that seem over the top to you. It's on her to work on healing those wounds, but if you want the relationship to work out you're going to have to give her a little leeway, and understand her reactions are not necessarily about you.", "Unfortunately it does! It's nice you don't have to know that kind of hostile jealousy :)", "Info did you knock her up on the first date?", "Oh brother...lmao she's trying to get a little rose out of you. Stupid games. NTA", "Nta, I think she cares too much about what some random thinks. It's odd. Like who cares how you are perceived by a stranger. She's your partner. She knows who you are. That's all that truly matters, unless for some reason she holds this man's opinion in high regard? I'm not seeing the issue.", "NTA. The only AH would be the other guy if he interpreted your question as claiming your property. Cuz that's gross.", "NTA- you asked a question to your girlfriend", "NTA. Your gf is projecting. Me thinks the lady doth protest too much. You asked a harmless question of her. She may have been flirting with the guy and is feeling guilty.", "NAH because you weren\u2019t making sure he knew she was taken. Tone and body language at the key to the difference. Also, her explanation is only informed by her past. If you haven\u2019t suffered abuse you are less likely to follow that train of thought at such an innocent question. She isn\u2019t wrong in that people who abuse would in fact manipulate the situation and when called on their \u201calpha\u201d behavior, gaslight and manipulate the abused.", "No. Admittedly it did happen quickly after she moved in with me. We have known each other a long time and we've been together for closer to a year and a half. Over a year was just a less complicated description", "I switch up how I take my coffee depending on my mood.\n\nSometimes I drink it black, sometimes with cream and sugar. Sometimes I make espresso and a latte. Sometimes I make cold brew (though it takes a few days)\n\nBut as far as my gf is concerned, I take it black with no sugar or cream because I\u2019m healthy\u2026", "They most likely are only together because of the child. Is 4 month old child 12 month old relationship", "I think what upset me most is how to her it was such a normalised response. I kept commenting on the guys behaviour.  Just cos it was so sudden. I was trying to understand it. She was very chill trying to explain the possible reason. It's like she expected it? maybe because of her past? It was such a casual thing to her. It made me question if this was the norm. You get me?", "Or maybe the guy was hitting on her and she didn't realize it, and he backed off when he realized she was with somebody.", "Both of you are putting too much thought into this.", "NTA. I think maybe you are both kinda insecure because you got thrown into a relationship with a child.", "My wife and I have been together for 10+ years. I know how she takes her coffee at home with our drip coffee maker, but at a coffee shop? I\u2019m going to ask every time.", "Not necessarily. There are plenty of people out there who legitimately don't pick up on subtle social cues like that and get anxious that they\u2019ve come across in ways they didn't realize to others. There are multiple possibilities here. I don't think there are enough clues to know for sure.", "NTA, come on... if she has a problem with that then her intentions with that guy weren't innocent because you didn't say anything that indicates jealousy. Often when you're being accused when it's clear there's nothing there, it's because the person making the accusations due to a guilty conscience.", "NTA \nIt was a simple, location & situation appropriate question.  Who cares what random guy thought?", "NTA, it sounds like you should have a conversation with your wife about whether or not this is an issue she has had before and if this is an insecurity she's been holding on to. Because it seems so weird that she would accuse you of being possessive if you don't have a history of being controlling and trying to isolate her.", "NTA.\n\nYou can't be responsible for what others think. You asked a question you needed the answer to, without malice. Don't over think this.", "NTA, why the fuck does she care so much about who thought what? This is an unnecessary conflict", "NTA. She\u2019s over-reacting.", "NTA for asking the question innocently. \n\nBut YTA for not knowing how she takes her coffee after a year.", "NTA and your wife is hypocritical, her mistake.", "NTA, she\u2019s overreacting a bit", "NTA. If you know you weren't being an insecure AH, and she knew you weren't being an insecure AH, then it really doesn't matter what the 3rd party thought.", "NTA\u2026 if your simple wiestion was taken as a dominance thing by the guy or your SO\u2026 they were on a whole different page.", "Thank you! I'm sitting here like.. 4mo kid.. been together a year.. the math doesn't work.", "How? She wasn't implying that OP is an asshole or they he did anything wrong, she was just explaining why the dude may have responded the way he did.", "Bruuuuuuuuuh. I don't get how you're not putting it together that she is accusing you of being like her abusive relationship, and being upset that you pushed away someone who is flirting with her. Like those are problems dude", "Uh\u2026.Okay? But like\u2026who cares about a stranger feeling upset that she is taken or how he might have interpreted your innocent action? You all will most likely never see him again. Kind of a very silly argument if you ask me \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Sounds more like arguing for the sake of arguing but anywho, NTA.", "I'm guessing his reaction would have been similar if you had you know... suddenly walked over with both of your drinks??? Bro was trying to flirt, bro would have abruptly left no matter how he found out she was taken.", "This right here, like there our alarms going off and you're not hearing them", "NTA, and RED FLAGS GALORE on your GF for trying to act like you\u2019re the jerk when she was the one flirting with some rando. How was asking her if she wanted sugar a problem? So WHAT if some guy stopped flirting with her when he saw she was with you? ISN\u2019T she with you?", "NTA. it was a simple question. why is the other guy implying you are? is he projecting?\n\nediting. deleted some. misunderstood some part of the post.", "NTA. But there is something going on here. If she is upset with you just asking things then there might be a problem. You wrote she was in previous abusive relationships. She might need go work on that trauma before the trauma ruins your relationship.", "NTA I get what the gf was saying but if YOU know you\u2019re not the controlling possessive type, and SHE knows it, then why does she care if a complete stranger thinks that? It\u2019s a non-issue", "NTA - why does it even matter if you were jealous ?", "You say your wife's not like that. How much do you really know your wife. Why would she be in a situation where when the guy realised she was taken immediately stopped talking to her, isn't it then fair to say that he was there with the intention of flirting with her, so how do you think that conversation was going before you asked her a question?", "honestly? sounds a bit like \\*she\\* was flirting with \\*him\\*. I don't mean that in a way that she was necessarily trying to cheat on OP, but it seems like she was maybe enjoying the attention from a stranger, and had a kneejerk reaction after OP asked her about the sugar, trying to say that OP was acting too controlling when he unintentionally ended the flirt.", "I keep saying this but I doubt he was a stranger to her", "Hmm my thing is why does she care so much what some random guy thinks? If a guy was talking to me and my boyfriend asked me an innocent question, I'd politely put the conversation on hold and answer my boyfriend...a stranger should understand this and if he doesn't then he must have some sort of motive like trying to flirt.. Just my thoughts!", "Yea! It might be HER normal but normal is very subjective. Her normal doesn\u2019t equal your normal. Doesn\u2019t make things like this right/wrong just different because the context is very important.", "She knew him but he didn\u2019t know about OP", "He\u2019s probably from her work (if she does work) and she hasn\u2019t mentioned OP to any Coworkers yet", "While i'm sure she's more than capable of handling herself, some men don't take it seriously until another man steps in. Not saying that's what happened or he was possibly flirting just saying it does happen.", "NTA I guess I just come from an older generation we say what we mean and mean what we say", "NTA - but her reaction makes me think that her motives were not very pure.", "Info - do you not know how your gf takes her coffee?", "Yeah NTA, wtf is wrong with her lol.", "You are NTA. It's not your fault for the guy backing off, if he was innocent he wouldn't have allowed that question to stop whatever they were talking about.", "NTA\n\nShe's there with a baby. Obviously the guy knows she's got a partner already. \n\nYour wife may be feeling stressed or socially isolated due to the demands of new parenthood, though.", "So? What's the verdict here? Sugar or no sugar?", "NTA. It was an innocent question. I would have made her get her own coffee after that", "Sounds like you caught her out flirting. NTA", "NTA. I don't think most people would perceive it that way. Unless you said it in some kind of really weird dramatic way, or if you definitely know she takes sugar, or if you never normally call her \"honey.\" I think she is over-thinking the situation.", "Are you saying there\u2019s no conflict?", "She had a 4 month old baby with her. I doubt anyone was hitting on her.", "Then why would he walk away just because the op asked if she wanted sugar in her coffee? An why would the question be considered acting possessive?", "My elderly grandfather (since passed) jumped in a ditch with his arms over his head during a 4th of July BBQ once due to fireworks, he served in WW2. Was one of the saddest things I have ever seen in my life. Some traumas never heal.", "Because she hasn\u2019t told the guy about OP and that OP was dating her.", "If she knew the guy that still doesn\u2019t explain anything. That\u2019s a literally the perfect chance to introduce op to the friend."]}
