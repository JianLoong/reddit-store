Unless you\u2019re very controlling (and lying about your intentions re: asking her if she wants sugar), her interpretation sounds overly dramatic to me.", "NTA\n\nIf you were really just asking her the question. If you were then she is acting mighty guilty about something. Just saying.", "Sounds like it says more about the guys intentions than yours. NTA", "NTA - your girlfriend has a rather high opinion of herself.", "NTA, but next time she gets black coffee.", "NTA and why is she concerned about how a random dude was interpreting the situation, that she will never meet again?\n\nYou keep mentioning she was concerned about what everyone else thought. Everyone else being that guy. \n\nThat's... Sus.", "NTA...wow....wow..........wow....She made that leap because you asked her how she wanted her coffee sounds like she didn't want the guy she was talking to to know you're her bf\n\nIt WAS an innocent question. I'm sorry mate. I'm a woman too, you were 0% possessive of her asking that simple question.", "INFO - How have you been with someone an entire year (and have a kid together) without knowing how they take their coffee.", "NTA\n\nif she has an issue with being \"taken\", then point her to the door", "NTA, or you're purposefully leaving out other patterns of jealous behavior. Her reaction seems disproportionate to the situation. It is true that if she's talking to a guy and you interject, it can come off as jealous behavior, but it seems so innocent in this situation. Either there's a lot you're not saying, or she's hypersensitive because she *is* wanting to flirt with other people.", "NAH it was either a huge misunderstanding or it didn't go the way you're saying.", "Who freaking cares what strangers thought lol She's way way overthinking this.

She couldn't get a dude's number while your back was turned or something?", "NTA. That\u2019s super weird on her part.", "NTA", "NTA.  She cares more about the guy's feelings than yours, and she doesn't want you interrupting when another guy is talking to her because she doesn't want him to know she's in a relationship.", "Nta. It sounds like you maybe interrupted a mini flirt session and she blamed it on you because she was enjoying the conversation or attention.", "NAH but do some self reflection, her assumption may be unfounded, but she knows you well\u2026. Then just think about it. It\u2019s really likely that after four months since birthing she is starting to feel attractive again\u2026. Foster that\u2026 you will all win if you jump on the making her feel attractive bandwagon.", "NTA. Don\u2019t worry about it. Look, just today my husband accidentally stole someone\u2019s parking spot. He felt really bad about it when he realized as they drove off angrily. Crap happens, one more person on earth thinks you\u2019re an AH. They won\u2019t be the last, whether you realize it or not.", "Bruh...", "NTA.\n\nYou were asking an innocent question. If the guy had a problem with it, then it makes you wonder what his intentions were.", "This just feels like so much overthinking", "NTA- you didn't even know she was chatting with anyone so how exactly did you put any controlling thoughts into your question, which was a perfectly innocent and socially acceptable question by the way. I think your gf was letting this guy think she was single.", "NTA\nYou just asked her if she wanted sugar in her coffee. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.  You needed info, specifically about the issue of sugar.  You were right to ask.  We're getting into some really weird social paradigms when a boyfriend is supposed to think, \"I'd better not speak to GF so as not to ruin her chances to speak to other men\".  Forget that.  GF is reading way, way, *way* too much between the lines here.", "How do you not know how your SO has her coffee after being together for a year?", "She doesn't think I'm an asshole. She just said it came across to strangers that I might be one of those 'alpha males' who need to possess their partners.", "She was in an abusive relationship previously and I think that was something that would happen. She was suggesting it as a possible interpretation of the guy as he completely backed away from talking to her.", "She's not like that. I was wondering why he stopped talking to her very suddenly.  She explained that he may have felt that I was calling attention to them interacting. She's been in a previous abusive relationship. She said that it was perceived by the guy that I might be possessive and was calling him out for talking to her. I had no idea that was a thing.", "It's me that was concerned about it. She just indicated a possible reason for him to stop talking to her so abruptly.", "This was her point. The fact that we have a son and we've been together so long. And I was louder than I thought I was, I guess? That maybe it was seen by the guy that I was calling out their conversation to the entire coffee shop.\n\nShe usually drinks tea and I know how she likes her tea. Some take their coffee differently.", "She doesn't have an issue. I have been dwelling on the guys reaction. It was so abrupt but her explanation makes me feel like a real asshole. I don't want her thinking I'm like her abusive ex. Even if she is too polite to suggest such a thing. I also don't want to repeat the behaviour if it is taken up that way", "I never thought that it could be seen as Jealousy. It was his behaviour that confused me. She was relaxed about the situation and suggested that because the man didn't know me, he may have thought I shouted across the shop because I noticed them talking. She was in an abusive relationship previously and he did get possessive.", "It was his behaviour I was confused about. He very suddenly stopped talking to her after I asked her. She said that one reason might have been that he thought I was the possessive type. She knows I'm not the jealous type but I can't control what a stranger might think", "I don't think she is. Our son is 4months old and she moved to my country when things got serious.  She has been in an abusive relationship before now and I worry that I was the AH, repeating negative experiences she had in that relationship.", "I have no fear about that tbh. She moved countries for us to be together. I would hope that wouldn't happen. She's not mad about it. I was the one that kept bringing up the guys behaviour.  Now I'm worried I was an AH. She was in an abusive relationship before and I don't want to repeat behaviours that she has experienced before. I hope that makes sense", "She's usually a tea drinker. She doesn't often drink coffee and some people take the 2 drinks differently. That's why I asked. I had no idea it might be taken up in such a way though...", "Nope, she's way overreacting. That's like, a ridiculous reach. You asked her if she wanted sugar because . . . you literally wanted to know if you should put sugar in her coffee. Honestly, I'm autistic, so I get why you worried, but this is one of those situations where the neurotypical person was being ridiculous and reading WAY too much into it. Sometimes a question is just a question.", "The fact that you are even asking this question in Reddit shows a clear lack of communication and understanding between you and your wife.", "If your side of the story is accurate then NTA and she's kind of overreacting, but your explanation about her previous relationship might explain that. However, I'm not sure why the guy felt that he had to stop talking to her as soon as you said that, unless he WAS trying to chat her up.", "I think there are men that would do what you're describing as a means of \"pissing on their property\" to make sure the other guy knew she wasn't available. Doesn't make anyone an AH here. Maybe the guy *was* talking to her with the intention of flirting and he stopped because he realized she was taken. In which case, it worked out.", "Don\u2019t worry, my husband and I have been married 13 years and it\u2019s still a mystery what either of us will want at a coffee shop on any given trip. Gotta shake things up in your day sometimes, right?!", "Yeah, I think especially with the use of the word \"Honey.\" Imagine a TV scene where a guy is talking to a pretty woman and then another guy shows up and kisses her just to make it clear he owns her. That's the kind of image she means, and pet names are a way of announcing to the store that she's your partner, but again it all sounds really innocent and like you didn't do anything wrong.", "Oh, so she wasn't actually annoyed with you for it? Then it's not really an AITA question", "Honestly, if she's suggesting that he reacted that way because of you asking, then she's a bit of an AH. No one is responsible for his behaviour but him. If he was looking to hit on her and he was put off because your asking about her coffee with an endearment (\"Honey\") made it clear that you were together, then it still doesn't make you an AH or \"possessive\". And she's an AH for even suggesting that it would. If he was put off by the realisation that she wasn't single, then that's a him problem, not anything that you did wrong. Period.", "Well, good. Then I hope the two of you can talk this through when the feelings aren't racing. You at least sound very considerate. Good luck!", "If his side of the story is accurate, there's no way he could possibly be the AH. Why even post this question? Feel like the only reason to post this is if he really was trying to interrupt, be controlling, and is now trying to justify it.", "That seems insane to me that he would react that way. She is more than able to handle herself and I wouldn't need to step in. I just didn't think such a simple question could be perceived in that way. I'm confused and a little upset that anyone might see me as controlling.", "Yo me it was innocent, to her it was innocent but I couldn't get over or explain his sudden reaction. I guess you see it in movies but I didn't think that stuff happened irl.", "No, she's not annoyed. She was trying to suggest an explanation for his behaviour and it made me feel like a total asshole. I'm a little concerned that I am since I interrupted an innocent interaction.", "I don't you're the asshole at all. But I will say people who have been in abusive relationships often develop sensitivities that can seem irrational from the outside. When you go through traumatic events you learn to become hyper attuned to danger signs. Those instincts are helpful while you're in the dangerous situation, but maladaptive outside of it. The fucker is they don't go away. It's the reason a lot of vets don't enjoy fireworks. The hindbrain doesn't get the message that the context has changed. If your girlfriend is carrying trauma from past abuse, she's going to react to certain things in ways that seem over the top to you. It's on her to work on healing those wounds, but if you want the relationship to work out you're going to have to give her a little leeway, and understand her reactions are not necessarily about you.", "Unfortunately it does! It's nice you don't have to know that kind of hostile jealousy :)"]}
