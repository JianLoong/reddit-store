My fianc\u00e9 and I have been together for 4 years and are getting married next summer. We are paying for our own wedding to avoid opinions.\n\n  \nMy fianc\u00e9 has a twin sister and 2 other older sisters. In an attempt to explain his dynamic with his mother quickly, my fianc\u00e9 often refers to her jokingly as his \u201cbusiness partner\u201d as their relationship is a bit cold. I have previously had a great relationship with his parents.\n\n  \nIt's also important to understand our relationship with my fianc\u00e9\u2019s twin sister. We have never been close due to some situations and personality traits. The vibe is very holier-than-though. I will attempt to describe some of many instances that describe my fianc\u00e9 and I\u2019s challenges with his twin. While my fianc\u00e9 and her attended the same college, she would take a nap and my fianc\u00e9 would be expected to pick up her car, get her groceries, fill her car with gas, and then return it to her. She did not learn to pump her own gas until she was 21. She found out about some of my fianc\u00e9\u2019s exciting new job opportunities and had her husband apply for all the same jobs in hopes that he would get them instead. She is now recently married with a baby.  \nFollowing our engagement, his family immediately started asking who was going to be in the wedding party. We discussed including family and concluded that we both wanted each other to have whoever they wanted in order to be comfortable on our wedding day. I chose not to have his sisters as we were not close and he was on board.  \nLong story short, I have moved out of state and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s family found out that the sisters, especially his twin, were not bridesmaids & were hysterical. His parents accused us of things such as making his twin cry so hard that she wasn\u2019t sleeping and that we worsened her stomach condition to the point where she had to go to the hospital. They met with their priest about us. His parents informed my fianc\u00e9 that I was \u201cshowing my true colors,\u201d will \u201ccontrol and manipulate him my whole life,\u201d and that he should \u201cthink long and hard about this wedding.\u201d They told us that \u201cas long as his twin was happy, everyone was happy.\u201d They informed my fianc\u00e9 that he needed to \u201cmuscle up\u201d to me and stand up for his sister. Through all of this, my fianc\u00e9 was heartbroken and furious at his family for talking about me in such a way and for treating us like this.  \nA lot came after this and I haven\u2019t seen them in months, even when I come home to town. Where we currently stand is that:  \n\\-Dad and fianc\u00e9 are on speaking terms and though he hasn\u2019t apologized but is now constantly telling my fianc\u00e9 how much he loves me  \n\\-His mother and sister won\u2019t talk to him or I  \nI have not seen or spoken to his parents or his twin since this and don\u2019t know if I should suck it up and get seeing them over with before the wedding or not.

Nothing you say or do will be the right thing to them, they don\u2019t want things to be calm, they want chaos. If a traditional wedding is important to you then go for it, but put your foot down, you choose your attendants and he chooses his, and everybody can just shut up.", "NTA.  It's your wedding, not theirs.  However, you need to seriously consider if this family dynamic is something you are willing to deal with long term.  It seems like the people showing their true colors are his family and you both (you and fiance) need to set some hard boundaries now.", "NTA - it\u2019s never going to stop if your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t stop it now. It sounds like MIL has put the girls first his whole life. He was expected to serve them.\n\nNow he\u2019s not and it\u2019s probably the first time he\u2019s ever pushed back on being their obedient servant. \n\nGood on him. You\u2019re going to be his family once you get married, they will all move to extended family and should be very very distant family as they will continue to make every event of your lives about them.", "NTA. Your wedding. You get to choose your bridesmaids.", "He can have them as groomswoman, do you get to choose his groomsmen? You really need to have a deep conversation with with him and find out where his priorities are. I have a twin brother that I cut out of my life because of him being an ass toy wife and his toxic co dependant behaviors. Nta, hold firm on this", "NTA, obviously. Whether you were in her wedding or not, who stands up with you in your wedding is up to you and the family are trying to emotionally manipulate you which is just not cool.", "NTA. There's no law that someone has to have all female bridesmaids and all male groomsmen, or that siblings are automatic in the wedding party. Times are a changing and if fianc\u00e9 wanted his sisters or twin in the wedding he would have asked them to stand with him. He didn't so his family should only be mad at him (and if they were kind, rational adults, they would be mad at no one). \n\nI don't see why either of you should have contact with any of them because they sound toxic and have made your fianc\u00e9, and now you, the scapegoat of the family.

But if you don't care about it then you don't care about it.", "NTA - If you give in now, you\u2019ll be giving into her for the rest of your married lives. Your wedding is YOUR day. She already had her own. And I doubt you were a bridesmaid at her wedding, so there\u2019s no reason she should be one at yours.", "NTA eloping is the way", "Elope. Problem solved with the wedding issue.\n\nSeriously though - you two need to set some serious boundaries and ALL of it needs to come from him. Every last piece of communication needs to come from him.\n\nTell your future MIL that if your husband wishes to have his sister stand up with him as a groomsmaid then of course he is welcome to but just like she opted not to have you in her wedding party, you have chosen to save those spots for your nearest and dearest and your future SIL has made it clear that she does not have that relationship with you.\n\nHE needs to set this boundary and he is going to need to enforce it. He needs to have it out BIG TIME with his father first - about how absurdly sick the dynamic with his twin is... how they have perpetuated a very sick entitled princess attitude in her and that he tolerated it whil he lived at home but he is done being her errand boy. THey are not close because of her attitude and behavior - case in point -- she has made your wedding all about her. He needs to have THAT conversation with his parents and make them understand this.\n\nAs for you - nothing you do will ever be good enough. You will be blamed for everything until he has it out in a big way with dear old mom and dad. For whatever reason his sister is the golden child. I've got to think the other sisters see it too and are sick of the princess attitude.\n\nnta", "NTA. As long as that was a decision you and your fianc\u00e9 made together and you were both okay with the consequences, that\u2019s totally fine. The parents are inserting themselves when it\u2019s not about them (also why you\u2019re paying for the wedding in the first place). Also, WILD that they told you they went to their priest about you and also that they proceeded to blame the future SIL\u2019s hospitalization on you?! Huge red flag. Glad the dad is coming to his senses. Sounds like a really messy situation.", "NTA. You\u2019re not the one who created the drama. Don\u2019t feed the monster.", "NTA clearly. I never understand families that die on the hill of a wedding.", "NTA, you get to pick your bridesmaids because you are the bride. You don't have to pick people you don't get along with because of family pressure from the groom's mom. Tell her to sit down, and pipe down, it's your wedding not hers, should she ever start speaking with you again.", "NTA. You didn't 'create' drama. They showed their true colors by going from 0 - 100 like that. Do whatever makes you and your husband happiest in the long run.", "NTA, BUT you have a lifetime of fighting with them. Might be better to just take this one in the chin and have her in the wedding", "Elope and go directly on your honeymoon. Renew your vows later in life - too much drama to enjoy the day", "Were you in her wedding?", "Or the husband could have had his sister stand on his side.", "and if it is truly that important, she can be HIS bridesmaid.", "Wow really? Even with the way these people are treating them both now, and have treated the fianc\u00e9 all his life? \n\nAre you one of those people from a healthy family that doesn't understand that other families can be toxic and abusive?", "I think the issue is that he does not want her to be in the wedding party. At least that is how I read it. That her husband is sick of being his twin's servant. Because if it was important to HIM, then he would have figured out how to include her on his side of the lineup.", "NTA. And I agree, husband needs to manage his family. Tell them this call was a joint decision and nonnegotiable and any further commentary insulting OP is also an insult to him. \n\nSetting these boundaries ironclad now could make or break your marriage down the road. Trust me.", "That sets the precedent for the future. Twin wants to name their baby \u201creally is it that big of a deal just let her name the baby\u201d it will be like this forever.\n\nOP you need to decide if you want to marry into this if he doesn\u2019t stick by you because it will forever and always be about the Twin, why I have no idea but stand your grown now or loose it forever. NTA.", "Or who lets family get away with toxicity because faaaaaammmiilllyyyy?"]}
