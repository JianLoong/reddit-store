Your in-laws just seem to love the drama and the twin in particular seems to be the favored kid. \n\nHopefully your fiancee can keep up the common sense and not fold to his mother and sisters demands, and he can focus on the important thing here. Starting a new chapter in his life with his partner.", "NTA. A same and mature person will not cry about not being in a wedding party. Wow. You don't even have to elope. Just exclude them completely. The entitlement and odesity is too much. \n\nIn the end, it looks like his family is going to have to be in the NC list. You can't fix the dynamic with the twin being coddled. I pity her husband", "NTA. His twin sister is a bitc* and his mother is encouraging her. About the job opportunities, if you happen to know which jobs the twin or her husband is currently applying, you should gather all friends and family members and let everyone who qualified apply for those jobs, so they won\u2019t get it. Also spread the word about how she treated her own twin as a slave during uni, trust me, some of her \u2018friends\u2019 would love to verify the story \ud83c\udf1d\ud83c\udf1d", "\u00a0\u201cas long as his twin was happy, everyone was happy.\u201d\n\nWho is really showing their true colours here.

Why would you want to marry into this family? This isn\u2019t going away, you\u2019ll be dealing with their bullshit and drama until the day you die (or finally divorce)\n\nIs this really the life you want for yourself and your partner?", "Good grief! \"As long as his twin was happy, everyone was happy.\u201d You and your fianc\u00e9 will NEVER be able to do anything right. I'm glad hubby-to-be is on your side, but can and will he be able to forever? \n\nIf you had all of his sisters in your wedding, you'd hardly have space for YOUR friends. And if it really was so important that twin be part of the wedding, she could stand up on HIS side!\n\nAbsolutely NTA. I hope you two can get through this.", "NTA. The role of a bridesmaid is to assist the bride during the preparation for the wedding. To be frank, I would not trust the twin sister anywhere near this wedding. The twin will not be the centre of attention for the day, or even have a key role so I would be worried about spillage of drinks, still wet nail varnish forgotten about, treading on the train etc. Beforehand, there are so many aspects of the wedding that could end up being changed if controls are not in place.\n\nThe family seem incapable of saying no to this person, so there will be a lot of tantrums, tears and sulking. Stick to your decisions otherwise, you and your fianc\u00e9 will not be allowed a life of your own.", "If your fianc\u00e9 wanted them as grooms women he could have asked them.

If I was in your situation, I'd talk with my fianc\u00e9 and say that his mom and sisters are uninvited for their bs behaviour.

She has major main character syndrome. We\u2019re you a BM in her wedding?", "NTA. If you all get along I do think you should include sisters and brothers in the bridal party as it will cause people to talk - why didn\u2019t Sally have any of her sisters as bridesmaids!!? They must have had a falling out. However, this behavior is so out of line! You are doing the right thing.", "NTA. His twin sounds like an entitled crybaby. Y\u2019all just do what makes Y\u2019ALL happy and forget those jerks!", "NTA and you did not create this drama - they did. Do not, under any circumstances, give in to the twin being in your wedding party. Your wedding will set the tone for that relationship and you don't want to start your marriage on the wrong foot. The behaviour of FMIL and FSIL is appalling. They are pitching a toddler tantrum to get their way. Don't let them or they will do this every time they don't get their way for the rest of your life.", "NTA.\nYou didn't create the drama, his mother and sister did. It's the wedding of you and your fiance. You're paying, have it the way you want it.", "They created the drama - not you!", "NTA honestly at this point it\u2019s probably a win if they don\u2019t come to the wedding. They\u2019ve showed they hate you and feel the wedding is a mistake. Why would you have people who hate you at your wedding. Especially when you know for sure they will cause problems. They will be miserable the whole day or give a Speach on how you\u2019re ruining their family. People like this have to be center of attention even at someone else\u2019s wedding.   \nMy husband mother was making crazy demands about out wedding. My husband kept arguing with me but giving in to her to keep the peace. It was her wedding her venue bigger than we wanted the lot. Then she demanded we invite and pay for someone she hates and their family to attend. I can\u2019t tell you how many times she complained she was forced to have them at her wedding. She hasn\u2019t seen them in the many decades since. Yet here she is demanding it. Oh only my fianc\u00e9 and I was paying for the wedding. Even my fianc\u00e9 wouldn\u2019t back down on this as crazy and not happening. So she cut contact and threatened all his family and extended family that\u2019s she\u2019d make their lives hell if they had anything to do with him or attend. We turned the wedding back into our own and changed everything. I felt so bad for my fianc\u00e9 but he was relieved as she was ruing the whole thing. \n\nA year later months away from the wedding he contacted them and told them they where welcome to the wedding. His mum said she couldn\u2019t come as she had nothing to wear. Yes it was a number of months away. On the day he actually told me it was better this way and he was so relieved as otherwise he\u2019d have been stressed all day at what she\u2019d do and how she\u2019d expect to be center stage. \n\nYou wishing he can have a loving relationship with his family will not make it be so. Any giving in to them or apologising for doing nothing wrong. Will be used against you and show them they can manipulate you and push to get what they want. Do not contact them at all leave that to your fianc\u00e9.   \nAsk him if at this point he wants people who hate you and who will probably ruin your wedding to actually attend. Tell him you will support his choice but he needs to know the risk he\u2019d be taking and not try and ignore it. That you need to make it clear that you will never accept or put up with being abused simply because it\u2019s his family and he doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat. That he needs to know that\u2019s not what you want nor will accept for your marriage. That you will support his choice but if they continue treating you badly then you will not allow them in your life and he will need to support you in that. That he is going to be your partner and just like you will support and respect him, the same needs to be true of him.", "NTA so the toxic people aren't talking to you, and may not attend your wedding ....... seems like a win win these people suck, your fianc\u00e9 needs therapy to understand that his needs come first.   you do not have to have anyone you don't want in your wedding.", "There\u2019s so much manipulation in this world because people allow the perpetrators to be successful at it. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re seeing it for what it is. Don\u2019t let it get to you and be strong.", "Bridesmaids are the family and friends of the BRIDE, not the groom.

And its funny cause its showing THEIR true colors, and they are pulling out all stops trying to manipulate you.\n\nDont give in and reward this madness!", "NTA to anyone other than your fianc\u00e9 who has to deal with his family", ">AITA for creating this drama when we previously had a great relationship?\n\nNTA\n\nYou did not create this drama! They did!", "NTA *They* are showing their true colors. Your guy comes with a giant sidecar of baggage called his horrible family.", "NTA - also you don\u2019t need to deal with his family - your fianc\u00e9 does. His sister is unhinged and the parents feed into that- there is really nothing you can do besides set and hold boundaries", "OP, if it is such a big deal, why can't your fiance have his sister be in the groom's party?  My best friend's daughter had her brother be her Man of Honor. It was awesome!", "First of all...YOU did not create this drama.  This drama is entirely on HIS family and count your blessings for him standing by you...BTW, red flag the moment he flinches.  Second and most importantly...this is you and your husband's wedding, not theirs.  You should decide who is in your bridesmaid party and he should decide his, END OF DISCUSSION.", "NTA. It's your wedding. Have whoever you want in the wedding party.  Marry this guy if you really love him and can endure a lifetime of his family being interfering and controlling. They're also gaslighting your husband, accusing you of the behavior that they are exhibiting. I'm glad he didn't fall for it. Once you marry move to the other side of the country...or as far away from this as possible and go NC. Do you or your husband have skills that can get you an international job? Move to another country and get a 1 bedroom apartment/flat that won't allow visitors. Best of luck to you. You'll be a stunning bride.", "Nta", "They are showing their true colours! All that nastiness about you being controlling is clearly them projecting. \nI think families can get so heated about weddings sometimes, maybe it comes from love but it's absolutely not ok to make demands.

I love this word lol. What would the bride equivalent be, bridesman?", "Hindsight is a bitch and if I had this knowledge back in my day, I would have either eloped or just had a simple ceremony and invited parents and siblings, then called close friends over for a BBQ some weeks later.\n\nBig weddings are overrated and way too expensive while being totally unnecessary.", "If i read correctly, she said in another comment that\u2019s what they asked all his sisters to do, but she is still pitching a fit about. It being a bridesmaid\u2026not to mention the fact that in twins wedding, OP was a guest book attendant.", "She needs to see this as setting the ground rules. Appease twin-sis now and that will always be how it is. Everything on her terms, all she has to do is cry. OP should tell his family she will not tolerate this manipulation of him, it has been going on too long and she is putting her foot down.

Madness.", "I hear you, though I'm not sure I would go so far as calling it makes. But I grew up in a Catholic family (I am no longer Catholic though) so I know the reasoning behind most of the rituals. \n\nWe didn't have a religious ceremony either. I think we had one reading though as it was directly applicable to our relationship and it was short. We should have had shorter vows, but hindsight is 20/20."]}
