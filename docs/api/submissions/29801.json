I was home with my baby he was around 8 weeks old and I get a call from MIL asking if nephew can use the toilet as they're at the park across from our home (10metres away). She comes in so nephew cannula the bathroom and tells me how her, both sister in laws and all the kids at at the park with some mothers from the school. I was so upset but thought maybe I was being hormonal so I left it. Told hubby when he got home and he absolutely lost it. I messaged my MIL saying she hurt me by not visiting her grandson but heading to the park near our home with everyone.

I am immunocompromised and we check of everyone is sick before visiting as they don't respect safely and distance. My husband lost his mind as we were trying to a baby and this was going to set us back a little bit. SIL and her husband making jokes about people having covid in the family chat so we left. She then messaged me abusing me more about being sensitive about sickness and I told her I'm not interested in speaking to someone who can't comprehend what having a chronic illness is like.\n\nA couple months pass and its time for our two year olds birthday and we're also going to announce our pregnancy. Exciting time, one would think. SiL walks in, doesn't say hello to me or her brother (in pur own home) she sits in the back corner of the backyard staring at everyone.

Im preparing the food and her and her husband can't wait so start serving themselves - I was like, ok I've not put everything our just yet, can you hold a moment..kept going. Husband asked them.to sit at the tables with everyone else, 3 times, but they wanted to sit in the back corner of the yard away from everyone.
