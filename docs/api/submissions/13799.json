I don't know how bad your relationship is with your sister, but your gf should definitely respect your boundaries.\n\nBy this line of thought, you should be able to ask if she would be comfortable with you calling her family randomly, if she says she would be fine with it, you could say that you're glad that she has so much faith in you, then proceed to explain why she calling your sister is a bad idea, and give her a rough idea of how she would respond.\n\nIf she says she wouldn't be comfortable with such a thing, then the problem solves itself because she can't continue complaining if there's an obvious double standard. \"How about an eye for an eye you give me your brother/sister's number (assuming she has a brother/sister)\" if she says no then i doubt she'll complain further.

Having some may make it harder to find a relationship but you're allowed to draw any line you want in a relationship as long as it's not abusive to the other person. \n\nIt is on the other person to decide whether or not that's a boundary they will respect, a deal breaker or a boundary they will not respect and thus risk issues.  \n\nThis is clearly something your tried to explain to her, tried to to reason with her and tried to have a conversation about.

She doesn't get to force a relationship with someone who hasn't reached out herself especially when it's against your wishes. Especially since you're not married and you're dating from a distance from what I understand? Your life belongs to YOU and being in a healthy relationship means that you choose WILLINGLY AND WITHOUT PRESSURE when to invite other parties in, how far they go in your bubble and what relationships you want to share with them. Sharing your family SHOULD be something you hesitate on because if and/or when you break it, it would then affect your family as well. \n\nShe's acting like a brat. Grown up healthy people don't use the cold shoulder to deal with disappointment in relationships. They talk it out. Her blocking you as punishment for you not doing what she wants is manipulative and borderline emotionally abusive. Especially when you're trying to talk it out with her. She doesn't get to demand ANYTHING from you and then block you because you don't bow down immediately, esp with things you've made VERY CLEAR you're uncomfortable with. You aren't her puppy dog. You're supposed to be her PARTNER with equal rights which means you talk about your desires/boundaries (both of you), hear each other out, be honest and then come to an agreement on where they overlap, where they don't and if those things are hard desires/boundaries and whether you are willing to bend (in a healthy amount) for each other or whether they clash too much.

Block her and don't unblock her. She doesn't need to be in a relationship if she can't respect boundaries, esp one so small and easy to respect. She also doesn't need to be in one until she grows up enough to realize that throwing a temper tantrum is NOT the way to go about dealing with emotions as an adult. She's not mature enough to handle not being obeyed. She needs to look past herself and understand what she wants is NOT the only thing that matters. This isn't McDonald's over burger King.

Gf is weird for wanting to pull a prank on your sister who she doesn\u2019t know and you aren\u2019t close with. IMO that\u2019s weird and disrespectful.

It is really stupid and immature to ask for someone's phone number to \"prank\" them.  Especially since they don't really know each other.  I really have to wonder what she is up to.\n\nShe sounds very immature and unreasonable.

If she just wants her number to prank her then it\u2019s your decision if you wnat to give it to her or not. Your gf is completely over reacting", "NTA. She can ask your sister for her number.", "NTA for originally saying no.  \n However you then gave the number out so YTA for that.   It's not your place to give out someone's money unless they've told you it's okay.  \n\nYour GF was out of line for pressing the issue and really went 0 to 60 with the \"I'm not a criminal\" thing,  what in the world?", "I followed your link and don\u2019t see the correlation.

Just because she asked doesn\u2019t mean you have to give up your sister\u2019s personal number, even if you two aren\u2019t really close. Then the gf gets mad at you and pouts by blocking you for not getting her way? Never mind the fact she\u2019s 22, that\u2019s some high school bullshit / immature / childish behavior.", "You are better off i think she is The asshole. A tich off knee, yes?"]}
