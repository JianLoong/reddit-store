My sister is the same age as me, but our relationship isn't very close, thus I didn't want to involve her in this.\n\nShe asked me in the afternoon a few times, I tried to avoid her request and change the topic until she insisted. Then until night, I told her that I wasn't comfortable involving my sister in our relationship.\n\nShe got furious about that and she felt that I didn't trust her or that I was treating her as a criminal and that she didn't deserve that.\n\nNow, I understood why she would think that and I tried explaining my reasoning but she got even angrier and refused to listen. I thought that the subject was overblown so I eventually apologized and sent her the number but she didn't want it anymore and hung up.\n\nAfter some chatting, she said some not-very-nice things and ended up blocking me.\n\nI'm curious If am I wrong for refusing her request or if she is wrong for getting super mad at this.\n\nps: I'm posting this at her request and she will be reading the comments.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680425395, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129fds5/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_sisters_number_to_my/", "score": 541, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
