Both your mom and your grandma need to grow up and realize your sister isn't some child. Good for you for calling that shit out and not passing along the message to your sister.", "NTA. Your mom is awful and clearly sees you and your sister as accessories to herself. I don\u2019t blame your sister for eloping and not involving your mom. Autism Moms are the absolute worst.", "NTA.\n\nPeople who use their children's disabilities or health problems for public clout are disgusting.

Your mom needs some help :(", "NTA: she's an adult. Your mom sounds like she can't understand that and wants her to stay a child. It's one thing to feel protective, but it's another thing to just get up in everyone's business. Everything your mom is saying (and grandma is enabling) sounds almost performative.", "NTA for calling out your mom on FB and drawing a clear boundary with your grandmother about your sister. It\u2019s utterly disrespectful to your sister for your mother and grandmother to portray her as someone with a \u201csevere mental disability\u201d who maybe should have a conservatorship! Your sister has clearly been doing great in life, going to college far away from home, getting an internship on her own, finding her person and making the heathy decision to keep her mother/grandmother at arm\u2019s length. Good for her and good for you.", "NTA, if your sister is competent enough to go to an out of state college and have an internship while maintaining a relationship, there is no way your mother would ever be granted a conservatorship. \nAspergers is different for each person but most are high functioning and seem \u201cnormal\u201d to the average person. \n\nAlso as someone who has Aspergers, it is still called Aspergers. The general masses are just now realizing that Aspergers is on the Autism spectrum. \n\nMy husband and I have been together for 17 years now and married for 8. I have Aspergers and he is no where on the spectrum. My family loves him. \n\nThis just sounds like your mom wants attention and drama. I could see being concerned if she was non verbal or has some cognitive impairment that would lead her to be easily manipulated but it sounds like she is stable and fully capable of making her own life choices. \n\nHopefully your sister and your new BIL don\u2019t get any backlash from what she\u2019s been posting. Being called a predator is damaging. \n\nFamily is soo messy sometimes. In my opinion the best thing you could do is just be there to love and support your sister and BIL. So sorry this is happening.", "NTA\n\nAutism Moms are so harmful, and the fact that she's tried to get a conservatorship of your sister is terrifying.\n\nMaybe you said it in an assholey way if facebook put you in jail. But your mom has been actively toxic first a lot. You and your sister don't owe contact to them, and I see why you've limited contact.", ">Now my mom doesn\u2019t like that my sister eloped and has called this guy a predator in an autism support group that was public on Facebook and this is group that gives terrible advice like my mom should get a conservatorship of my sister. \n\nActually kinda got mad at this, but unsurprised. The autism mommy blogger type of mother makes their persona so much about a \"mother of a child with a disability\" that they ultimately become more hindrance than support. The attempted abuse of your sister through legal approaches is disgusting, and it's no surprise she's cut off.\n\nYour grandma isn't much better, because she's playing flying monkey for your mother and making excuses for her before trying to get you to bypass your sisters boundaries. She can cry all she likes, but it's little more than a consequence for her actions. She isn't a victim and your mother isn't either.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA stressful read.
