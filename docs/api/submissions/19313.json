(How ironic that he called *you* a baby over your debilitating fear when he has an owie on his left hand.)\n\nOne outburst of frustration in the moment might be understandable. He\u2019s still punishing you for being terrified of driving in the rain after you had an accident in the rain? 100% AH, all day every day.", "NTA- because there are things called uber and buses.  If he saw it was raining then he knew he had to find another way to get there.\n\nPlease go seek help for this, being able to drive is important in most cities if there is an emergency you need to be able to get out.", "NTA... it was up to him to get himself to the interview.  If it was important to him, he would have found a way", "NTA, took my grandma years to get over her accident and she never did fully. \n\nHe should have planned better, for eg an Uber or something", "NTA-you didn\u2019t refuse.

That seems highly, highly unlikely to me.\n\nI'm a plumber by trade, I have burnt my hands soldering more times than I can count over the years. This would only prevent him from driving if he had a seriously bad burn, like, requiring hospital visits kind of thing. If that's what happened, then I can appreciate him not being able to drive.

Probably not, but it's how she feels, so I can understand how OP would still be rattled, it is a hard thing to get over.", "NTA\n\n>  He told me to try to make an effort for this bc he really needed to go there. \n\n**HE** is free to *make an effort* to work through his hand pain.", "NTA he had a physical impediment (burned hand) that made him not able to drive, you had a psychological impediment that made you not able to drive.\n\nYou should of course, heal your wounds and work on stopping this trauma from affecting your life, but you were not up to the task at that moment (just like he wasn't) and you could put others at risk.", "NTA.

He could have made it there just fine with one usable hand.", "NTA but he should gone no matter what, maybe he was frustrated but he shouldn't have to take on you, there are taxis, Uber, etc, just breathe and try talk with him, is not your fault.\n\nBut i don't think he wanted to go the interview", "Its hard doing anything when you have a panic attack so NTA , you did try", "NTA. This sounds manipulative as shit. If he wanted the job, he could have driven one handed?

It\u2019s not your fault that your fear driving in rain.

Wow.", "For those saying \"He can just take a cab/Uber/bus/PT,\" please know that those don't exist everywhere. Or they do but they're not the slightest bit convenient and/or waaaay to expensive for a person who already doesn't have a job.\n\nAlso, since he doesn't have a job and she pays all the bills, him calling a cab is *her paying* for a cab.\n\nNTA. You literally couldn't do it. And, to be perfectly honest, I wouldn't *want* to ride with you driving in the rain. If you're terrified and not confident, I'm going to be white-knuckling and praying.", "NTA but do you guys live somewhere where you can\u2019t call a cab? Even if you do, he knew he burnt his hand, he knew you had an issue driving in the rain and he still forced you to go. He is definitely TA.", "NTA. While I think you will ultimately need to work through your fear and ultimately will likely need tk drive in the rain at some point, it is not your responsibility to get him to his interview. It\u2019s 2023 so unless you live in the middle of nowhere ride services are very easy to get in a pinch", "Info- Does he not actually want a job?", "NTA. it\u2019s not like you aren\u2019t working on it and you did try. he should\u2019ve secured alternate arrangements if it was that important instead of dismissing you and belittling your experience. also it seems like he\u2019s using this as an excuse and perhaps he didn\u2019t actually want that job. this might prompt a bigger conversation, especially if you are paying majority of the bills. good luck op!", "NTA.  He could have called a taxi/Uber.  And unless his left hand was mashed to a pulp, he probably could have driven himself if need be.  Pain is good.", "NTA. \n\nTell him to get a cab. \n\nBut also, you need to work on getting over your trauma instead of accepting it", "NTA. He couldn't get a taxi or someone else to get him there?
