That seems highly, highly unlikely to me.\n\nI'm a plumber by trade, I have burnt my hands soldering more times than I can count over the years. This would only prevent him from driving if he had a seriously bad burn, like, requiring hospital visits kind of thing. If that's what happened, then I can appreciate him not being able to drive.

It's a ridiculous PITA, but it's not impossible.", "NTA but he should gone no matter what, maybe he was frustrated but he shouldn't have to take on you, there are taxis, Uber, etc, just breathe and try talk with him, is not your fault.\n\nBut i don't think he wanted to go the interview", "Its hard doing anything when you have a panic attack so NTA , you did try", "NTA. This sounds manipulative as shit. If he wanted the job, he could have driven one handed?

It\u2019s not your fault that your fear driving in rain.

Wow.", "For those saying \"He can just take a cab/Uber/bus/PT,\" please know that those don't exist everywhere. Or they do but they're not the slightest bit convenient and/or waaaay to expensive for a person who already doesn't have a job.\n\nAlso, since he doesn't have a job and she pays all the bills, him calling a cab is *her paying* for a cab.\n\nNTA. You literally couldn't do it. And, to be perfectly honest, I wouldn't *want* to ride with you driving in the rain. If you're terrified and not confident, I'm going to be white-knuckling and praying.", "NTA but do you guys live somewhere where you can\u2019t call a cab? Even if you do, he knew he burnt his hand, he knew you had an issue driving in the rain and he still forced you to go. He is definitely TA.", "NTA. While I think you will ultimately need to work through your fear and ultimately will likely need tk drive in the rain at some point, it is not your responsibility to get him to his interview. It\u2019s 2023 so unless you live in the middle of nowhere ride services are very easy to get in a pinch", "Info- Does he not actually want a job?", "NTA. it\u2019s not like you aren\u2019t working on it and you did try. he should\u2019ve secured alternate arrangements if it was that important instead of dismissing you and belittling your experience. also it seems like he\u2019s using this as an excuse and perhaps he didn\u2019t actually want that job. this might prompt a bigger conversation, especially if you are paying majority of the bills. good luck op!", "NTA.  He could have called a taxi/Uber.  And unless his left hand was mashed to a pulp, he probably could have driven himself if need be.  Pain is good.", "NTA. \n\nTell him to get a cab. \n\nBut also, you need to work on getting over your trauma instead of accepting it", "NTA. He couldn't get a taxi or someone else to get him there?

In your case, your experience of having an accident in the rain \"taught\" you (through consequence) that 'driving in the rain' can be life-threatening. Your brain has overgeneralized this \"lesson\" to be driving in the rain = death.\n\nThese associations can also be *unlearned* through various deliberate efforts. There are plenty of people who just accept that if one \"cant\" do something due to panic attacks, they just have to live like that forever and it's just the way it is. Unfortunately, *this approach actually makes phobias more severe* (due to negative reinforcement, you have \"successfully\" lived by avoiding driving in the rain, which strengthens a kind of superstitious thought cycle).\n\n**So you have a choice.** You can live like this (and slowly get worse) for the rest of your life, ***or*** you can decide to treat it through some version of exposure therapy (ranging from the most intense/fastest 'flooding' to the more gentle/gradual graduated desensitization).  If you would have drove your boyfriend that day with the proper preparation it could have been a part of this process. For graduated desensitization, you may start with just sitting in a car in the rain (or going through a rain-like carwash) and just building a new association that rain in car is survivable, then driving a short distance slowly in no traffic, and on up. Proper preparation is some training in mindfulness and diffusion. Then you can sit and observe your \"panic\" feelings, knowing they are just produced by your brain and will pass; allowing yourself to notice them from an observing-self.  You continue the process of repeated trials and the panic feelings get less and less. If you did it multiple times in a day over several days in a row (massed trials), you would be able to notice that the response is diminishing.", "Or do this crazy thing called taking a cab!
