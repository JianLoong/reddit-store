Your mom may have been the direct target but this sort of thing isn't like a sniper with carefully chosen ranges.

She was around for Woodstock.\n\nYou don't get to claim \"a product of their time\" as an excuse for racism for a Boomer.  Boomers knew every bit as well as we do that racism is bad.

Racism is not a particularly Boomer problem.  The specifically Boomer problems are growing up in an easy time economically and not realizing that their kids and grandkids have it tougher, but their issues around racism aren't different than anybody else's.\n\n\"A product of their time\" is just straight slander against everybody else that age.\n\nIn any case, you didn't get her kicked out for your mother's sake.

Your mom's reaction is a bit weird, and while I guess it's good for her to be so... patient?? Did she not consider how her 15 year old daughter would be affected by witnessing this and being told to stay silent? You did the right thing. It might be worth apologizing for going around and telling your dad without letting her know first, but regardless of her opinion it was the right thing to do.

I agree your grandmother is a product of her time, but she's in someone else's house and she's disrespectful to her host.\n\nIn regards to your mom saying the abuse was toward her and you shouldn't have interfered, look at it this way, you didn't do this for your mom, she was willing to tolerate the abuse, but rather did it for yourself because you didn't want to see your mom go through that abuse. Good on you.", "NTA. She might have been racist directly towards mum alone, but it's mum's job to ensure you and your brother don't have to endure that abuse by proxy.

Your brother getting complimented on his \"white/light\" features was introducing colorism into your home. You did your entire family a huge favor.\n\nYour mom sounds great, but giving old people a pass on being racist is wrong.

Like, to the point I wasn't allowed to walk home from school for weeks because I dared walk home with a friend who happened to be black. I never understood that and when my mom saw the Gulf War years later I remembered finding her crying because \"those black boys are really out there fighting right alongside our boys\". I told her, \"Mom, they're ALL 'our boys'.\" She looked at me like it was the first time anyone ever explained that, and she took it to heart. We still live in a small, predominantly white town but my sisters God son is black, my niece is currently living with her boyfriend and they're having a biracial baby, my mom is knitting baby blankets like there's no tomorrow, not a single person sees race the same way. \n\nI never saw it like them but maybe that's because I grew up during the latch key kid Era and my mom grew up while there were still stupid rules about who could use water fountains?

I also have made sure my progeny are not exposed to racism through me. I just don't understand why other people raised like I was can still be racist. Perhaps they find something good in feeling hateful towards others.", "Great answer!", "I served in the Military with guys who were raised racist, and a few of them became enlightened, and admitted to me that everything their parents had told them was wrong...", "Exactly the same for me. When racism is all you hear growing up of course you think it's the right way, why would you parents lie? It wasn't until I went to university I truly saw that I and them were racist assholes and ever since I've done my very best to change my ways. My sister is exactly the same."]}
