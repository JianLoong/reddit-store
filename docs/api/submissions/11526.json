Any negative consequences she experiences as a result of her choices, are 100% HER fault. \n\nThere's just no valid reason, why she hasn't been able to learn why racism is wrong.

As you get older, you may accept this is not true, but head knowledge is NOT heart emotion.  People may not be able to stop instinctive thoughts and feelings, but they CAN control how they REACT to those thoughts and feelings.\n\nThe greatest example I saw of this, was a woman I worked with some years ago.  She was born in the 30\u2019s in Texas (was a table dancer at Jack Rubys\u2018 club during the Kennedy assassination - I met the most INTERESTING people at work, lol) and was raised with the (unfortunate) values of the times.  When I knew her, she was a grey haired \u2018old lady\u2019, kindly grandmotherly type, who treated everyone kindly and equally.  Anyway, one day one of the guys was giving her a hard time - he was an obnoxious chip-on-the-shoulder guy that no one liked, who happened to be black.  When he finally walked away, she turned to me in anger and said \u201cwhen I was growing up, a black person had to cross the street if they saw you coming towards them on the side walk and I wish it was like that now!\u201d.

And expected THAT to go over well, lol smh). \n\nYour mom is taking the \"pacify\" road, which would've been fine if she was the only one affected. But she's NOT the only one affected, and here's why: \n\n1. Grandma is walking all over her son's ADULT choice to marry a black lady and being SUPREMELY disrespectful of her own son's marriage. This is NEVER done. Not by anyone decent. Grandma lacks decency for this (and apparently, people of \"her time\" valued 'decency' a lot more than \"today's kids\", I'm told, so this is ESPECIALLY interesting on Grandma's part). And I hope you and your brother keep this in mind for your own future relationships - nobody else has the right to butt in unless there's abuse (including infidelity) going on. However, being of a different race is not abusive; Grandma is just racist. Yikes.\n\n2. Grandma was also being directly racist to you and Lil Bro with her comments about y'all's looks and coloring relative to each parent. As an adult, she should've known better than to say stuff like that, AND to say it to kids, AND to say it to her own grandkids, to boot. Yikes. \n\n3. You and Lil Bro are half your mother, so Grandma being racist to your mother means that she inherently hates a LARGE part of what you kids are as well, and she's being indirectly racist to you and Lil Bro via being directly racist to your mother. Also, continuing to expose your children to someone who doesn't treat you or them decently is, to me, abusive in itself - it teaches your kids that that kind of garbage is acceptable when it's not, and it also causes the kids to be stressed out by having to navigate tense and fraught adult domestic relationships.   While I appreciate that your mom was trying to be the bigger person here, that can NOT come at the cost of your kids' peace of mind and their rights within their own home - Grandma is a GUEST. As a parent, you have to be a LOT more selfish in many senses, and have higher standards for who you allow around your children at home. (Out in the world is a different story, as you can't fully control that at all and it would be problematic to do that, but at home, it's YOUR domain, and for someone else to not only be so disrespectful but to be so ungrateful after you graciously took them in despite their historical hostility towards you is a VERY bad example to set for your children). \n\n4. Grandma clearly has nothing going on in her life to the point that she has the time and energy to be petty and toxic, and towards children, and towards HER OWN GRANDCHILDREN, to boot. Yikes. \n\n5. You didn't cause Grandma any suffering by telling your dad - she did that to herself. Not sure why your mother is blaming you kids for the actions of someone who's been proven, time and again, to be a toxic, lying, racist, indecent, shit-starting, FULL-GROWN ADULT. Really. Let's have some perspective here - Grandma is a grown-ass woman. Stop blaming the kids for her being a shitty human, and worse, a shitty GRANDMA. Grandmas are SACRED in a way a lot of other adult figures aren't - but that's EARNED, and Grandma has, conversely, earned the right to be out on her ass and away from the \"dirty black people\" (blech), and has violated the Sacred Order of Grandmas.\n\nTo see your own grandkids as lesser-than just because their mom is black.... man, that's out-of-pocket. Full disclosure, I'm south asian (born and raised in the US), and my brother is married to a white lady from Switzerland. If HER parents ever tried that nonsense on their kids or on him (while their marriage isn't the greatest and he's trying to get out for other reasons), she'd be absolutely pissed, and your dad was right to be. He KNEW it was a bad idea to bring his mother into his home and around his family because HE KNOWS HOW SHE IS, and HE ALREADY KNEW THAT SHE WAS NEVER GOING TO BE DECENT TO Y'ALL, and oh look - he was proven right. Sometimes anger serves a valuable purpose. \n\n\"Respect your elders\" and all that, yes, but that respect is earned, and Grandma has only earned contempt.", "Yeah, your grandmother is not \u201ca product of her time.\u201d She is an adult who is perfectly capable of changing her disgusting views and opinions. Your mum was kind enough to allow that mean old racist bat to stay in her home and she was repaid with cruelty. You are NTA. You were protecting your mum.", "NTA. The issue here is your grandmother may have targeted your mother only but her toxicity absolutely effected you. This nasty woman even was sneaky and counted on your mother\u2019s good heart by behaving in front of your dad. \n\nThese are qualities you do NOT want around your children.", "NTA, the heck with her. (not sure if I can say h\\*ll, where she should spend eternity.)", "NTA and honestly, **both** of your parents should have known better from the start.  I understand her intentions, but your mom especially failed at protecting you.  Of course you're the victim of racism when you have to watch your mother- who you look like - get attacked because of how she looks!  Granmda hateful didn't have to say it directly to you, in her mind she found her loophole.", "NTA.\n\n>She also says that my baby brother (6months) is lucky to have my dad's light eyes and fairer skin unlike me, because I look exactly like my mom.\n\nShows that not only is she racist, she isn't the smartest one in town. At that age eye colour, hair colour/texture etc aren't set yet. I know someone who has pitch black hair as an adult now had platinum blond hair as a toddler. Might sound cold, but good riddance.\n\nAnd no, she isn't a product of her time. 78 years isn't *that* old. There are lots of people that age who aren't racist like she is. They might say stupid things, not realising they are racist things (product of their time), but when you ignore your mixed grandchild, bully your coloured DIL when you're alone with them and stop all of that and act differently in front of your son, you're doing it on purpose and are absolutely racist.", "NTA\n \nYour grandma is abusing you.  Your dad stepped up to recrify it.   \n \nI don\u2019t think your mom is TA. I think she is too kind for her own good and is absorbing abuse and allowing you to be exposed. It backfired.\n \nYour grandma is TA here, clearly.", "NTA Honestly, it\u2019s sad that you had to advocate for your mom, but good for you. I know your mom meant well but I don\u2019t agree with her \u201cshe\u2019s a product of her time\u201d views. My husband uses that argument for racism but I say there were plenty of people who knew racism was wrong back then and that\u2019s why there was a whole war to end slavery, and that\u2019s why there was a civil rights movement. Anyone who is still racist after everything that has happened in this country is choosing to be racist because they are assholes. Your dad was raised by her and clearly he is NOT an asshole.", "no no no NTA\n\nYour mom using the age and upbringing of your grandmother as en excuse for her behavior is plain wrong! \n\nEven if a person is truly a product of his/her time they can always learn/adjust/adept to new circumstances. Nobody is too old to learn new things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnly asshole in this story is your grandmother for breaking her promise to be respectful towards you and your mother", "NTA, and just ask your mom if she would sit by and let grandma be racist towards you if you didn't complain about it. Why would it be any different if its for her?\n\nAt the end of the day, enabling racism is nearly as bad as being racist itself. Both give validity to the bigoted thoughts and let it continue to pervade our society.", "Uh, sounds like you were also the target of her racism. NTA, and good riddance.", "You are NTA. I don\u2019t buy the \u201cproduct of their time\u201d bullshit. My Oma was 80 when my cousin married a black man and she loved him like one of her own grandkids. She was an elderly woman who had immigrated from the Netherlands. She was born in 1918 and wasn\u2019t racist. You do not have to put up with living with a racist and just because she\u2019s 78 does not exempt her from consequences for her actions.", "NTA.  Good job sticking up for your mom.", "nta", "NTA\n\nI would've kicked her out myself right after she threw away the spices because they \"smell\".", "NTA tolerating \u201ca product of her time\u201d is why we\u2019re having a resurgence of pretty open, blatant, and oppressive racism *now*.", "YTA", "I don\u2019t think you are a bad person but you should have respected your mothers wishes", "I'm so sad for OP's mom, but this whole idea that these old racists are just a product of a DiFfErEnT TiMe is ridiculous. She's lived through SEVERAL civil rights movements, she absolutely should know better, but refuses to.", ">I\u2019m sorry, the civil rights movement was 60 years ago. Maybe her parents were a product of their time, but she\u2019s had 60 years to evolve into a decent human being.\n\nExactly.\n\nI'm retired now but I worked in a male-dominated STEM field. When I was just out of college 40+ years ago, I would give my older coworkers (who probably had granddaughters my age) a pass when they were mildly sexist/patronizing - I got called \"young lady\" a lot. (It didn't help that I was petite and looked younger than my age).\n\nBut it was mostly people who I didn't work with closely - and I figured more than likely  NOT deliberate. So I weighed the risk of being seen as having a chip on my shoulder with the aggravation of feeling patronized and decided it wasn't worth bothering pointing out the error of their ways.\n\nI was a lot less tolerant of this attitude from coworkers in their 30s and 40s and I definitely would NOT have tolerated anything nearly as toxic as described here.", "Adding that mom was actively hiding that behavior from another parent. Dad has every right to know what kind of behavior is happening in his household to and around his children. And there is no situation where it's okay to tell your children to keep a secret from the other parent. That actively erodes familial relationships. \n\nIt really sucks that OP did the right thing and was attacked for it by the person that should have most been on their side.", "THIS!! I wish I could give you an award for this!! The abuse that OP has witnessed and endured can have permanent damage and cause PTSD. In younger children it actually prevents parts of the brain from developing properly. Being abused and witnessing abuse is nothing to shrug off. It has serious heath consequences.", "Also, she was the target of some of the comments. The grandma mentioned how OP was dark like her mom which means by extension she\u2019s also talking about her. That does things to anyone but especially in the teens", "I hate that \u201cproduct\u201d shit too. That\u2019s what everyone says about older people but the thing is. They\u2019re the ones that should be the MOST understanding. They\u2019ve had the most time to reflect on their previous actions and to learn from the changing world around them. They\u2019re the ones that should most understand how their words and actions affect others. My grandfather (upper 70s) has a HORRIBLE habit of promising things to multiple people. And big things too like vehicles and houses. Not once has he been forced to see the emotional fallout or be condemned for his actions. He gets scolded but that\u2019s it. No one actually holds him accountable and expects him to change because \u201che\u2019s just like that.\u201d Honestly he became a relative and not family to me when he promised me a house for months and then took it because it was his late brothers old house and he wanted to move into it. And I tried so hard to not hold it against him too much because it was his late brothers. But he lost me the day I found out he sold it", "Oh my God, this!!!\n  \nI'm Hispanic, but I am not white-passing at all. Not in the least. \n  \nI wouldn't say I was terrified, but I was definitely more than a bit nervous when I was planning to meet my very very pale-skinned husband's family.\n  \nIn a conservative state in a major city that is still very conservative. Where I am a very small minority.\n  \nThey were, they ARE wonderfully kind people. Never a mean word said from them. They would not be out of place in Mr. Rogers's neighborhood. They are amazing, though my MIL passed on, she adored the grandchild she got to meet.\n  \nI actually felt bad that I thought for a minute that they might be racist. I thought, \"Does it make ME racist that I automatically assumed THEY would be racist just because they are white? AM *I* the problem here?!?!?!\"\n  \nMy FIL is not quite 78, but very nearly there. He would definitely have something to say to OP's grandmother.", "My grandma is in her late 70s and her pride and joys are her mixed grandchildren. She brags on them constantly (sometimes I got jealous cause she\u2019s much closer with those cousins than me and my siblings lol and practically raised some of them). Her late husband (my grandpa) was born around 1930 and he was a staunch democrat who went to a liberal arts college going front lines on protests as a student. As an older man he would argue to anyone who listened about politics that impacted black Americans. I never knew either of them to say a questionable word when it came to race, as you say, they were in fact anti-racist due to the time they have had facing and observing first hand the extreme racist views and actions that have plagued America in the last 80+ years. My other grandma was actually a bit younger, was kind to everyone but she had a few questionable takes a few times that were quickly shut down by everyone else in our family. Her husband sometimes blamed black people for his life problems apparently (he never spoke of it around me) and my dad had to tell me when I got older that he was flawed and didn\u2019t understand that he made his own choices and that his views were incorrect and harmful (he told me after he passed as a lesson on how people we love can still be wrong and hateful in some aspects, and we should learn from this). That generation had the choice to see injustice and be mad about it, educate themselves (they saw the blatant bullshit first hand so honestly it should\u2019ve been easier to educate) and be anti-racist, or they could absorb toxic views with no question and allow themselves to be puppets for hateful fear mongerers. It\u2019s a choice just as it is now. We can listen to Andrew Tate or racists/sexist/homophobic spokespeople that still thrive today and we can question the opinion and facts, shut it down and ridicule it, or we can blindly listen and become toxic. There\u2019s always been issues like this and i really don\u2019t think age is an excuse at all.", "I think you need to have a serious conversation with your mom about the types of stuff that one should fight back against. Your mother may have been raised in a culture that talks about respecting elders, but why should it extend to having to endure racist comments and other types of verbal abuse. I know it\u2019s not my place to tell, but I\u2019m trying to at least provide some advice so that your mom can see that not everyone deserves respect. Has your mother ever faced other types of verbal abuse and did she ever try hiding it? Cause if so, it\u2019s not right. She needs to start being open about how this is making her. Sorry for sounding too demanding, I just hate in laws who are racist for no reason.", "Your mom doesn't understand that by not saying anything, she's *actively encouraging* your grandma's behavior towards her. Your grandmother already started towards you with that backhanded comment about yours and your brother's skin. It was only a matter of time until she escalated towards you as well. Ask your mom what would have happened when you became the target. If she says she would have said something then, ask your mom why it's okay for her to be mistreated but not you. IF she says we would have figured it out and tried to stop it on your own before escalating to your dad, ask her why she doesn't love you enough to stand up for you.", "From one black woman to another please tell her to stop it lol. That type of kindness won\u2019t end racism and cause you, your brother and her continued harm. \n\nBest of luck \u2764\ufe0f", "I would definitely talk to your mother about this - maybe even show her this post? It\u2019s important that she be able to stand up for herself, not just for her own sake, but also for your sake and your brother\u2019s sake. It\u2019s not healthy behavior to allow anyone, regardless of age, to treat you like that. She had you doubting yourself for doing the right thing. Her inaction in this situation, as well as her response to you, is harmful.", "Also Grandma was racist to OP not just her mom. Saying shes unlucky to look like her mom bc she doesnt have fair skin is awful. And pretty much as directly racist as you can get. NTA at all, your mom should be proud of you", "\nMaybe being there alone will make him realize his mistakes.", "10/10", "The Catholicism is part of the problem. If your mom went to catholic school, she grew up around A LOT of abuse. My grandmother was left handed and would be have her hands bloodied for writing with her left hand while being told she was controlled by demons. Catholics is one of the most abusive religions there are. You\u2019re taught early \u201cspare the rod, spoil the child!\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the more gross logic! Your grandmother is an Italian catholic, she comes from the land of the Pope. Italian Catholics have a higher superiority in their eyes because of this. I can\u2019t begin to tell you the levels of complexity in logic that are here. It\u2019s all ridiculous in reality.", "Still, her abuse can have lasting effects on you. Witnessing the abuse perpetrated on your mother can be more harmful to you than enduring it yourself. You did the right thing telling on her. Let her stew in her own hate alone.", "Oh, sweetie, I used to think the same about my abusive grandmother, who I grew up with.
