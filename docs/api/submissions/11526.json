Any negative consequences she experiences as a result of her choices, are 100% HER fault. \n\nThere's just no valid reason, why she hasn't been able to learn why racism is wrong.

As you get older, you may accept this is not true, but head knowledge is NOT heart emotion.  People may not be able to stop instinctive thoughts and feelings, but they CAN control how they REACT to those thoughts and feelings.\n\nThe greatest example I saw of this, was a woman I worked with some years ago.  She was born in the 30\u2019s in Texas (was a table dancer at Jack Rubys\u2018 club during the Kennedy assassination - I met the most INTERESTING people at work, lol) and was raised with the (unfortunate) values of the times.  When I knew her, she was a grey haired \u2018old lady\u2019, kindly grandmotherly type, who treated everyone kindly and equally.  Anyway, one day one of the guys was giving her a hard time - he was an obnoxious chip-on-the-shoulder guy that no one liked, who happened to be black.  When he finally walked away, she turned to me in anger and said \u201cwhen I was growing up, a black person had to cross the street if they saw you coming towards them on the side walk and I wish it was like that now!\u201d.

And expected THAT to go over well, lol smh). \n\nYour mom is taking the \"pacify\" road, which would've been fine if she was the only one affected. But she's NOT the only one affected, and here's why: \n\n1. Grandma is walking all over her son's ADULT choice to marry a black lady and being SUPREMELY disrespectful of her own son's marriage. This is NEVER done. Not by anyone decent. Grandma lacks decency for this (and apparently, people of \"her time\" valued 'decency' a lot more than \"today's kids\", I'm told, so this is ESPECIALLY interesting on Grandma's part). And I hope you and your brother keep this in mind for your own future relationships - nobody else has the right to butt in unless there's abuse (including infidelity) going on. However, being of a different race is not abusive; Grandma is just racist. Yikes.\n\n2. Grandma was also being directly racist to you and Lil Bro with her comments about y'all's looks and coloring relative to each parent. As an adult, she should've known better than to say stuff like that, AND to say it to kids, AND to say it to her own grandkids, to boot. Yikes. \n\n3. You and Lil Bro are half your mother, so Grandma being racist to your mother means that she inherently hates a LARGE part of what you kids are as well, and she's being indirectly racist to you and Lil Bro via being directly racist to your mother. Also, continuing to expose your children to someone who doesn't treat you or them decently is, to me, abusive in itself - it teaches your kids that that kind of garbage is acceptable when it's not, and it also causes the kids to be stressed out by having to navigate tense and fraught adult domestic relationships.   While I appreciate that your mom was trying to be the bigger person here, that can NOT come at the cost of your kids' peace of mind and their rights within their own home - Grandma is a GUEST. As a parent, you have to be a LOT more selfish in many senses, and have higher standards for who you allow around your children at home. (Out in the world is a different story, as you can't fully control that at all and it would be problematic to do that, but at home, it's YOUR domain, and for someone else to not only be so disrespectful but to be so ungrateful after you graciously took them in despite their historical hostility towards you is a VERY bad example to set for your children). \n\n4. Grandma clearly has nothing going on in her life to the point that she has the time and energy to be petty and toxic, and towards children, and towards HER OWN GRANDCHILDREN, to boot. Yikes. \n\n5. You didn't cause Grandma any suffering by telling your dad - she did that to herself. Not sure why your mother is blaming you kids for the actions of someone who's been proven, time and again, to be a toxic, lying, racist, indecent, shit-starting, FULL-GROWN ADULT. Really. Let's have some perspective here - Grandma is a grown-ass woman. Stop blaming the kids for her being a shitty human, and worse, a shitty GRANDMA. Grandmas are SACRED in a way a lot of other adult figures aren't - but that's EARNED, and Grandma has, conversely, earned the right to be out on her ass and away from the \"dirty black people\" (blech), and has violated the Sacred Order of Grandmas.\n\nTo see your own grandkids as lesser-than just because their mom is black.... man, that's out-of-pocket. Full disclosure, I'm south asian (born and raised in the US), and my brother is married to a white lady from Switzerland. If HER parents ever tried that nonsense on their kids or on him (while their marriage isn't the greatest and he's trying to get out for other reasons), she'd be absolutely pissed, and your dad was right to be. He KNEW it was a bad idea to bring his mother into his home and around his family because HE KNOWS HOW SHE IS, and HE ALREADY KNEW THAT SHE WAS NEVER GOING TO BE DECENT TO Y'ALL, and oh look - he was proven right. Sometimes anger serves a valuable purpose. \n\n\"Respect your elders\" and all that, yes, but that respect is earned, and Grandma has only earned contempt.", "Yeah, your grandmother is not \u201ca product of her time.\u201d She is an adult who is perfectly capable of changing her disgusting views and opinions. Your mum was kind enough to allow that mean old racist bat to stay in her home and she was repaid with cruelty. You are NTA. You were protecting your mum.", "NTA. The issue here is your grandmother may have targeted your mother only but her toxicity absolutely effected you. This nasty woman even was sneaky and counted on your mother\u2019s good heart by behaving in front of your dad. \n\nThese are qualities you do NOT want around your children.", "NTA, the heck with her. (not sure if I can say h\\*ll, where she should spend eternity.)", "NTA and honestly, **both** of your parents should have known better from the start.  I understand her intentions, but your mom especially failed at protecting you.  Of course you're the victim of racism when you have to watch your mother- who you look like - get attacked because of how she looks!  Granmda hateful didn't have to say it directly to you, in her mind she found her loophole.", "NTA.\n\n>She also says that my baby brother (6months) is lucky to have my dad's light eyes and fairer skin unlike me, because I look exactly like my mom.\n\nShows that not only is she racist, she isn't the smartest one in town. At that age eye colour, hair colour/texture etc aren't set yet. I know someone who has pitch black hair as an adult now had platinum blond hair as a toddler. Might sound cold, but good riddance.\n\nAnd no, she isn't a product of her time. 78 years isn't *that* old. There are lots of people that age who aren't racist like she is. They might say stupid things, not realising they are racist things (product of their time), but when you ignore your mixed grandchild, bully your coloured DIL when you're alone with them and stop all of that and act differently in front of your son, you're doing it on purpose and are absolutely racist.", "NTA\n \nYour grandma is abusing you.  Your dad stepped up to recrify it.   \n \nI don\u2019t think your mom is TA. I think she is too kind for her own good and is absorbing abuse and allowing you to be exposed. It backfired.\n \nYour grandma is TA here, clearly.", "NTA Honestly, it\u2019s sad that you had to advocate for your mom, but good for you. I know your mom meant well but I don\u2019t agree with her \u201cshe\u2019s a product of her time\u201d views. My husband uses that argument for racism but I say there were plenty of people who knew racism was wrong back then and that\u2019s why there was a whole war to end slavery, and that\u2019s why there was a civil rights movement. Anyone who is still racist after everything that has happened in this country is choosing to be racist because they are assholes. Your dad was raised by her and clearly he is NOT an asshole.", "no no no NTA\n\nYour mom using the age and upbringing of your grandmother as en excuse for her behavior is plain wrong! \n\nEven if a person is truly a product of his/her time they can always learn/adjust/adept to new circumstances. Nobody is too old to learn new things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnly asshole in this story is your grandmother for breaking her promise to be respectful towards you and your mother", "NTA, and just ask your mom if she would sit by and let grandma be racist towards you if you didn't complain about it. Why would it be any different if its for her?\n\nAt the end of the day, enabling racism is nearly as bad as being racist itself. Both give validity to the bigoted thoughts and let it continue to pervade our society.", "Uh, sounds like you were also the target of her racism. NTA, and good riddance.", "You are NTA. I don\u2019t buy the \u201cproduct of their time\u201d bullshit. My Oma was 80 when my cousin married a black man and she loved him like one of her own grandkids. She was an elderly woman who had immigrated from the Netherlands. She was born in 1918 and wasn\u2019t racist.

Maybe her parents were a product of their time, but she\u2019s had 60 years to evolve into a decent human being.\n\nExactly.\n\nI'm retired now but I worked in a male-dominated STEM field. When I was just out of college 40+ years ago, I would give my older coworkers (who probably had granddaughters my age) a pass when they were mildly sexist/patronizing - I got called \"young lady\" a lot. (It didn't help that I was petite and looked younger than my age).\n\nBut it was mostly people who I didn't work with closely - and I figured more than likely  NOT deliberate. So I weighed the risk of being seen as having a chip on my shoulder with the aggravation of feeling patronized and decided it wasn't worth bothering pointing out the error of their ways.\n\nI was a lot less tolerant of this attitude from coworkers in their 30s and 40s and I definitely would NOT have tolerated anything nearly as toxic as described here.", "Adding that mom was actively hiding that behavior from another parent. Dad has every right to know what kind of behavior is happening in his household to and around his children. And there is no situation where it's okay to tell your children to keep a secret from the other parent. That actively erodes familial relationships. \n\nIt really sucks that OP did the right thing and was attacked for it by the person that should have most been on their side.", "THIS!! I wish I could give you an award for this!! The abuse that OP has witnessed and endured can have permanent damage and cause PTSD. In younger children it actually prevents parts of the brain from developing properly. Being abused and witnessing abuse is nothing to shrug off. It has serious heath consequences.", "Also, she was the target of some of the comments. The grandma mentioned how OP was dark like her mom which means by extension she\u2019s also talking about her.

They\u2019re the ones that should be the MOST understanding. They\u2019ve had the most time to reflect on their previous actions and to learn from the changing world around them. They\u2019re the ones that should most understand how their words and actions affect others. My grandfather (upper 70s) has a HORRIBLE habit of promising things to multiple people. And big things too like vehicles and houses. Not once has he been forced to see the emotional fallout or be condemned for his actions. He gets scolded but that\u2019s it. No one actually holds him accountable and expects him to change because \u201che\u2019s just like that.\u201d Honestly he became a relative and not family to me when he promised me a house for months and then took it because it was his late brothers old house and he wanted to move into it.

He would definitely have something to say to OP's grandmother.", "My grandma is in her late 70s and her pride and joys are her mixed grandchildren. She brags on them constantly (sometimes I got jealous cause she\u2019s much closer with those cousins than me and my siblings lol and practically raised some of them). Her late husband (my grandpa) was born around 1930 and he was a staunch democrat who went to a liberal arts college going front lines on protests as a student. As an older man he would argue to anyone who listened about politics that impacted black Americans. I never knew either of them to say a questionable word when it came to race, as you say, they were in fact anti-racist due to the time they have had facing and observing first hand the extreme racist views and actions that have plagued America in the last 80+ years. My other grandma was actually a bit younger, was kind to everyone but she had a few questionable takes a few times that were quickly shut down by everyone else in our family. Her husband sometimes blamed black people for his life problems apparently (he never spoke of it around me) and my dad had to tell me when I got older that he was flawed and didn\u2019t understand that he made his own choices and that his views were incorrect and harmful (he told me after he passed as a lesson on how people we love can still be wrong and hateful in some aspects, and we should learn from this). That generation had the choice to see injustice and be mad about it, educate themselves (they saw the blatant bullshit first hand so honestly it should\u2019ve been easier to educate) and be anti-racist, or they could absorb toxic views with no question and allow themselves to be puppets for hateful fear mongerers. It\u2019s a choice just as it is now. We can listen to Andrew Tate or racists/sexist/homophobic spokespeople that still thrive today and we can question the opinion and facts, shut it down and ridicule it, or we can blindly listen and become toxic.

Has your mother ever faced other types of verbal abuse and did she ever try hiding it? Cause if so, it\u2019s not right. She needs to start being open about how this is making her.

The reason she wasn't lonely living with your family is that she had your mother to berate and you to actively ignore-because believe me, ignoring you except for comments about your skin color was absolutely her way of making you feel less than and inferior.\n\nMy aunt is a generous, wonderful person. I'm closer to her than I was to my grandmother (her sister). She still didn't get everything she wanted. She had to adapt to what worked for family.

Sure, it is not good for older people, but her whole personality is not good for everyone else, so sucks to suck granny, but off you go. Let your mom know that just seeing her being treated that way is hurtful, that hearing about how \"lucky\" it is that your brother looks more like his dad and how unfortunate for you to look like your mom, hurts.

You are the target of racism, and she needs to protect you, too.", "NTA. But I do get where your mom is coming from and it might be good for you to understand what she's had to bear in her life. She's dealt with enough racism and different types of racism that she can let this all just roll off her back (to a certain extent). She knows that the things that your grandma says and does have nothing to do with your mom and everything to do with who your grandma is. Your mom must be one strong woman. And she knows this!

And standing up for yourself should never be wrong.\n\nI also know that matters of race and family are never as black and white (as Reddit will make you believe). For most people who have grown up in a world where they've had to deal with a ton of racism (both blatant and not so in-your-face), it's not so easy to always call it out or cut people off when it crops up. I mean, let's just say if I cut out every person that I've witnessed being racist in my life, I'd be in a pretty lonely room. And maybe without a job. Well, this job.
