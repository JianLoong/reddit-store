One time I called her like I always did and she told me she was with a guy friend at a car dealer looking at cars or whatever. Yeah it didn't last but I quickly realized she had to always have some guy around....she couldn't stand being alone. That's been 12 yrs since I broke up with her and I hadn't heard a peep out of her in all that time until earlier this year she messaged me and that she had gone to my old apartment complex (we met there as she was the leasing agent while I lived there), and sat in the parking lot reminiscing about the late night visits she'd make. Anyway she reached out and we were just talking like we had run into each other on the street and then she started to allude to her marriage and that they had almost called it quits a few times. While she didn't come out and say it, I quickly realized that she was looking for a hookup.....she even came out saying that she wanted to find a 'boytoy'. Apparently the relationship is merely just a piece of paper at this point. She'd text once a day or so and we'd just have a casual conversation (I never let it go very far) and then one day I just didn't reply to her. Haven't heard a thing from her since. I figure she got the message that I wasn't gonna hook up with her and she moved on. \n\nAnyway, women do this kind of thing to tell their guy they aren't happy. Either you sit her down and you both figure out what's wrong, or you let her know you're gonna walk because no woman should be hanging out with a guy friend she met on a dating site/app. I wouldn't trust her either.....I mean why hang out with a 'guyfriend' she met on the same dating app you and her met on. Sorry just sounds like she is leaving her options open, she has you as a BF and that's enough to satisfy her, but just incase things go south with you, she can goto this other guy.

I'm not sure what else you need to know in order to make yourself feel better.  To be honest, you're coming across as jealous, insecure and clingy.  You either trust your girlfriend or you don't.  There's no evidence or smoking gun to indicate that your girlfriend isn't being honest with you about her friendship with 'guyfriend'.  It seems like the two of them simply like each other's company and they enjoy going out occasionally.  Just like any friends would do.

His behaviour ended up being everything I feared and worse and he's gone now, I am navigating what to do because I love this person very much and I am in love very much too, she wasn't willing to part with me and that's something you maybe need to think about as I'm speaking from the perspective of the guy you're fearing, if she stands her ground he's important to her.

If it's a romantic thing then you're best off elsewhere, fact it wasn't pursued and they've kept going as friends prior to you suggests they may be legit as friends to me and if you are unable to accept that she's right to not like it, women can have male friends. Either way you likely have to accept it because she's unlikely to admit to it if she's undecided, it's up to you to deal with the insecurity rather than make her responsible for it because that will bite you in the ass and if you don't like that then tough titty. \n\nUltimatums aren't a good sign because it means you don't trust her, people dress that one up but it's BS when they do. I'm not saying you should or you shouldn't trust her or the guy, me and my friend have crossed every line but she was in an abusive relationship and that's maybe different, I was trying to be her friend and I'm still very conscious of it now there's nothing in the way because she's important to me regardless of whether I'm sleeping with her or not, it's just always going to be hard not to I think. I was a villain to him, him to me, she means the world to me but I could have cared less how I impacted on him, difference is I never put her in the position you want to put your girlfriend in now.
