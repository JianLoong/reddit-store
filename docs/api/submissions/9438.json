But she's taking the same risk as she ages, so again, just make sure you guys are on the same page here.\n\nOverall, though, you were an absentee dad from the sounds of it and are probably responsible for the state of the relationship between you and your daughter. If you don't want to invite her to larger events with your gf and friends, fine- that's probably a recipe for disaster, but maybe actually make time for your daughter in other ways.

I hope you have a terrific day!", ">then being called a gold digger shouldn't be an insult\n\nGold digger as a term has derogatory connotations. \n\nFirst it is just generally used as a derogatory term. Even if the GF was comfortable fitting the definition of the word, she would recognize that is was being used to degrade her which is reason enough to be offended. It is like if you call someone a \"hick\". They might be happy recognizing their rural roots, while still being offended by the term.\n\nSecond \"gold digger\" implies that she is *only* interested in the OP for his money. If she cares about him for other reasons she might consider this an offensive reduction of their relationship.\n\nLastly a gold digger is typically digging without the knowledge of their partner. They are lying to their partner to get at the partner's money. If the GF and OP are both aware of the nature of their relationship then it isn't deceitful, and it is reasonable for the GF to be offended at being called deceitful.", "Just like he forgot about his daughter, unless there was some event he was expected for.

She hurt you because your abandonment still hurts her.  You knew she had been drinking, don\u2019t even remember the substance of your disagreement, yet you chose to reject her again for what she said while drunk. And here you are, pretending like you did it from a moral high ground.  Grow up. YTA 100%. \n\nYou are cruel to your daughter. And ostracizing her in front of family because you are petty is just sad.  The wounds you caused since she was 13 \u2014 treating her as irrelevant or an afterthought \u2014 has fucked up how she values herself and relationships.

Understandable and predictable, to any good parent.\n\nEdit: Probably never even occurred to you that she thought she was looking out for you by pointing out you are catering to a gold digger.

My dad absolutely adored me until the day he died, and he was the only person in my corner.  Gave me a moral code I live by, values that support me through troubling times, and a belief that I am worthy of love. He was my hero.  I hate that you ruined the bond your daughter deserved.  A father\u2019s love shapes how little girls see themselves and men. Fix this. Dump the arm candy and start family therapy to get your daughter back.
