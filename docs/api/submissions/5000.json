You can offer help going shopping for a new outfit if that's something she needs financial support for (and you're able to offer)", "NTA. She's an educated adult.

She would have offered some solutions to help and would have also expressed support if your daughter made the choice to start a weight loss journey.\n\nYour job as parents is to support your daughter. When she is not making good decisions that aren\u2019t something you agree with, you try to work with her to solve them. You do not throw them in her face.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that she felt unfairly criticized and hurt, and your wife is building a breeding ground for resentment if she continues this.

It's jokingly referred to as the \"freshman 15\" (15 lb weight gain). \n\nYou are absolutely correct - harping at your daughter is not going to get her to lose weight. In fact, it's more likely to cause her to stress eat and gain more.\n\nIf you want to help, perhaps suggest some family activities that don't involve sitting around. Go roller skating, bowling, laser rage, whatever. Something fun that is *not* portrayed as trying to get her more physically active - that's just a side effect of having some fun times.", "NTA. I'm a bigger person and I'm well aware of it. My mother regularly points it out and it's not helpful - there's some trauma attached to why I gained weight that she does not want to acknowledge, much less discuss so it's very much a looks issue for her and about 'what people might think' which does not help the issue. \n\nKeep being supportive - your daughter may well turn to you when she is ready.", "NTA. \n\nWhen I was in HS, I had an ED. I\u2019m in college now and starting to gain back some weight. My sister brought it up. I almost went no contact with her because she said stuff very similar to what your wife said. Not saying your daughter had/has an ED, just saying that it is a possibility.\n\nAlso, our bodies are changing. We\u2019re growing and maturing. We\u2019re under a lot of stress in college and, especially during/after finals season, our weight fluctuates a lot. \n\nTo add on, you mentioned this was your daughter. Assuming she is cisgender, she likely has a period. Periods can make our weight fluctuate and can cause bloating.\n\nThere are so many different possible reasons for weight changes and your wife has no reason to say shit like that. Verbiage like that is the same verbiage that caused my ED. There are ways to show your concern in a kind and loving way. This was not it.\n\nIf you were T A at all, it would be because you left the room and didn\u2019t tell your wife to drop it. So no, you are NTA. Your wife needs to do better", "NTA\n\nDiscussing a child's weight is a mine field adult or not.   \n\nI have no idea why your wife chose to point out to her college educated child that their clothes likely don't fit because they gained weight.   That's not something that needed to be addressed, that's something your child is already well aware of.   \n\nJust saying \"hey, did you notice you've gained weight?\" isn't helpful, it's just mean.", "If she wanted you to be on the same page she should have made sure you were on the same page.  She jumped the gun by speaking to your daughter before you worked out a consensus.  NTA", "NTA. You told her how you felt about it, she agreed - decided to bring it up and expected you to back her up despite knowing your feelings on it.\n\nBut, I think the fact that your daughter said she \"didn't know\" if her clothes not fitting was weight related was either her being uncomfortable talking about it, or general lack of self-awareness in regards to the situation. Clothes not fitting should make it obvious to someone that they're gaining weight. And if it's noticable to you, it SHOULD be noticeable to her as well.. (someone might not notice a small weight gain or loss and be surpised when they step on the scale, but if it's significant enough where others are noticing over a year and clothes aren't fitting - if she genuinely doesn't realize that she's gained weight - something is wrong)\n\nWeight is a sensitive subject. As a dieitian, I never assume a patient wants to lose weight despite what their weight or BMI is. I ask how they feel about their weight first. Your wife could have been more sensitive bringing up the subject. Maybe could have asked \"Why do you think they don't fit?\" (Kind of like motivational interviewing). \n\nI understand being concerned for her daughter's health, but there was better ways to go about this subject.. I would have taken the \"I don't know\" response about weight as \"I don't want to talk about it\" and stopped pushing it in that moment. Maybe she would have felt more comfortable with a 1:1 conversation vs infront of both parents. Who knows. \n\nYour wife is an AH for ignoring your boundaries. Your daughter is an adult now and I don't believe it's \"lazy parenting\" to NOT want to discuss your adult childs weight gain when she gave signs she may not feel comfortable discussing it in that moment", "This is a tough one. Weight gain can be insidious and the fact that the daughter is complaining that clothes no longer fit (I'm assumed here that she's surprised by it) suggests that it's possible she wasn't aware how much weight she was gaining. Something similar happened to me; for a few months I noticed that certain jeans kept getting tighter and tighter but for some reason I assumed they were shrinking in the dryer. It wasn't until I weighed myself and saw the actual numbers on the scale that I realized it was me gaining weight, not the jeans shrinking. \n\nThat said, there is a difference between acknowledging weight gain vs. harping on it. I don't think there is anything wrong with saying that you've noticed a weight gain and you just want to make sure that she's ok. Maybe she's stress eating. Maybe just she's having a hard time making healthy choices because she's surrounded by peers who are eating a lot of junk and she's trying to fit it. Maybe something is wrong and she's using food as a coping mechanism. \n\nIt's impossible to know and I think it could be a good thing to talk especially if you are good at communicating. Your wife could offer to take her shopping for some new clothes that fit better to show that she's not bringing it up as a judgment. The fact that your wife wants \"a united front\" tells me she's looking for an argument with opposing sides rather than aiming for a discussion coming from a place of love and concern. That's actually more concerning to me than anything. \n\nYou're trying to respect your daughter's autonomy and discussing weight gain - especially with a teenage girl - can be a minefield that should be approached very delicately. You've been honest with your wife that you don't feel comfortable doing that, so you're NTA.", "NTA is my vote. These are very delicate situations and abstaining from pressuring a family member over weight is totally above board IMO.", "NTA. Trust me, your daughter knows that she has gained weight. She doesn't need people pointing it out to her. Lots of young adults gain a bit of weight (hello freshman 15) when they are on their own. If she's just at the point where her high school clothes aren't starting to fit, it sounds like maybe this is the case. \n\nHowever, the deeper issue lies with why your wife wants to talk to your daughter about the weight gain. Does she think that pointing out the weight gain will magically make your daughter eat less and exercise more? Does she think less of your daughter because she's gained weight? Is your wife appearance-oriented (i.e. does she often comment on people's appearances, either negatively or positively)? Is she worried about your daughter's mental health while at school? I don't know your wife, so I'm not sure of the reasons behind why she's so dead set on \"having a talk\" with your daughter.\n\nIt's one thing to do a check in with your daughter and make sure that she's happy and thriving while at school, but anything beyond that is intrusive, and weight doesn't need to be a part of the conversation. Just let her know that she's loved and that you are available to talk if she wants to.", "NTA, but your wife is", "NTA!!!! ED therapist here. You absolutely did the right thing. Good for you for being smart enough to have this boundary.", "It's never helps if a parent or anyone else says anything. She knows already. If you interfere she will resent you and she will punish you by making it worse by eating more.  If a person is gaining weight...they know. You don't need to be telling them that. She needs to make her own decisions even if they are poor ones. Unless she is a kid then I would stay out of it if you want peace in your family. Your wife is TA.", "NTA!!! Your wife's way of thinking brings me back to my childhood. Sucks being the child of that kind of parent. I understand the concern, but she's an adult and as a college student should be able to deduct the correlation between her clothes getting too tight. Sometimes kids, everyone really, are just looking for an ear to vent about frustrations, and most likely NOT wondering why. If it were my daughter, I'd have mentioned something from the very beginning. You've gained a little weight, are you eating normally, when was your last physical, how are classes and friends going? Weight gain can also be from stress, anxiety, depression.", "NTA. As someone who has struggled with their weight since childhood (currently prepping for gastric sleeve) it pissed me off to no end when people pointed out my weight since it was what I worried about every waking hour of the day. Daughter is an adult, she can manage it herself, no need for anyone to point it out.", "NTA but I don't think it is black and white.\n\nMy question is why did daughter come to her parents to complain that none of her clothing fit.\n\nAt that point how would people respond? The daughter is 19 or 20 and not developmentally challenged. Surely she was able to notice a weight gain - notice her clothing was tight - and put the two together including a reasonable assumption that she had been eating more or exercising last during the Fall semester - for any reason - including stress.\n\nThere is of course a slight chance that it is medical but in that case, it would make more sense for a college sophomore who is aware of cause and effect to ask to go to a doctor because she doesn't understand why she is having unexplained weight gain - could be thyroid - could be PCOS - could be something else entirely.\n\nSo yes weight is very delicate and most people don't address it and even if someone broaches the subject are generally very reluctant. And the whole subject is often fraught with more emotional dynamite when it is mother and daughter who often have issues.\n\nNow if daughter were home for the summer, parents could be supportive by cooking healthy meals and making sure they were available. When summer between college years my parents and I did do this together and it was extremely healthy as we were all in it together but it wasn't something being imposed on me. It was something I wanted and requested their help in terms of preparing the kinds of meals that would help me lose weight in a healthy manner.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
