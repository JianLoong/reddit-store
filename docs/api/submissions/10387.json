{"id": 10387, "submission_id": "116k32i", "title": "AITA for \"favoring my oldest\"", "selftext": "My husband and I have 3 daughters, Evie (16), Lola (14), and Katie (5). Evie is our biological daughter, we adopted Lola when she was 2, and we're fostering (and planning to adopt) Katie.\n\nI will be the first to admit that I don't spend nearly as much time with Lola as I do with Evie and Katie. Katie because she's 5 so I don't have the option to leave her at home very much, plus she has multiple appointments every week and Evie because she doesn't mind coming along for all of the kid stuff with Katie. I do make a point to get one on one time with the girls. I take one girl out for breakfast every Saturday, we rotate who goes with me. Besides that, the only one on one time is going to be when they tag along for errands. For example, Katie goes to therapy twice a week. 9/10 times Evie comes with me. We drop her off then get coffee and dessert while she's in therapy. When she has visits with her mom Evie and I find something to do in the area. Lola has the option to go to all of these things but chooses not to. She still gets upset that I don't bring her something back. I always tell her you only get something if you go. Evie doesn't get anything when she doesn't go.\n\nThere's also the issue of babysitting. Last year Lola made it clear that she does not want to babysit at all. I told her that's fine. Evie doesn't mind babysitting and usually babysits 3-5 hours per week. I pay her $10 per hour so she gets $30-50 per week on top of her allowance. Lola complains that it's not fair that Evie gets so much more than her just because she doesn't like kids. Lola gets an allowance for the chores that she does around the house but I'm not going to pay her for not babysitting.\n\nYesterday was Evie's turn to go out for breakfast with me and Lola got mad at that too. She doesn't think Evie or Katie should get Saturdays since Evie gets one on one time when Katie has appointments and Katie shouldn't because I'm always with Katie. I admit that I snapped at her because she's been complaining more than usual this week and told her that she has to stop these tantrums. Evie gets more time with me because she chooses to go to appointments or visits with me. Evie gets more money because she chooses to babysit. Katie spends all day with me because she's 5. None of this is a slight to her and the problem is completely due to jealousy from her own decisions.\n\nShe's barely spoken to me yesterday and today and my husband thinks I was too harsh.\n\nEdit: Put bio/adopted/foster in the post because Lola constantly says we favor Evie because she's my bio daughter and Lola isn't then completely forgot to add the fact that Lola blames the favoritism on the fact that she's adopted.

Have fun constantly feeling less than your sisters! :)\"\nYTA OP", "Uh... Clearly the best option is take Lola to do something that she wants to do apart from the Saturday brunch thing?", "I think if your child is feeling neglected don\u2019t try to push back. You\u2019re taking Katie to therapy then doing something evie wants during that time. I think Lola wants that dedicated time where you say let\u2019s go do something special just the two of us and make it just our place.

When they no longer fit into your routine and wants?\n\nLola is telling you she needs something different and it's your job as parent as deliver it. Especially since Lola is adopted and has expressed she feels excluded,  you need to step it up. \n\nYou are excluding Lola because she doesnt fit into your routine the way the others do. It's ridiculous and narrow minded that you expect all three to be the same,  all have the same needs and it perfectly fit into your wants and needs. \n\nLola needs a different routine and different expressions of love and family. It's your job as parent to figure it at and at least try to give it to her.", "YTA. You decided to have three kids, but you expect them to fit your schedule to see you. Instead of hearing her and maybe finding a way to change this, you are telling her that is not your problem.", "For the love of all that's holy, just take your kid to the park or for a freaking walk just the two of you.

She is a teenager. \n\nAnd she gets less time with you. You admit it yourself. Treating all kids the same does not equal treating them right and fair.\n\nAsk her already what she would like to do with you. Maybe a movie night. Maybe cooking with you. It could be anything.", "YTA for trying to prove your child is TAH instead of figuring out why she is feeling neglected and doing something about it.   You are the adult. You have a child who isn't mature enough to express her needs, and you want to put an AH label on her?  Shame on you.", "The thing about 14 year olds is they have a hard time communicating their needs. Lola feels less than and even though logically you're right about everything, you have a sad child who feels she is not as worthy because shes adopted. You need to take a softer approach with her. Ok if she doesn't want to babysit fine thats her choice, but you could bring her back a treat from the appts with katie and evie. And more than that she might need to talk to someone about her self worth and self esteem.", "YTA why aren\u2019t you more concerned about spending time with Lola and addressing her needs? You make it sound like an annoyance more than anything.", "OP, YTA. I was super depressed as a teen and the second child. My mother did everything she could to spend time with my older sister, \u201cthe golden child,\u201d instead. She still does the same with my sisters daughter versus me and my son. You know what kind of relationship there is now between us. Very low contact. Not to be harsh, but my mom is now literally nothing to me but a vessel I use when I need help. I have no emotional attachment to her anymore.", "I was leaning twd n a h but your comments put you squarely in YTA.  You are ignoring the main issue and still being deliberately obtuse and minimizing your daughter's feelings when people explain why ur daughter wld be upset.  \n\nBut hey don't worry soon she won't want to spend any time with u even on Saturdays and u won't have to deal with her.", "She wants to spend time with you. But YOU don\u2019t want to MAKE TIME for her. Lola is feeling disconnected from you. She\u2019s made it clear she wants to spend *real quality time with you* and you completely blow her off. Yes YTA. Make time for your child, and stop trying to blame her for you having poor time management. You can easily make more time for Lola. You just *don\u2019t*. Not every kid can fit into every box. Some kids require more time, some kids require more space.", "You need to stop thinking about your daughters from your perspective.\n\nLola is adopted. You think of her as your daughter, while she carries the memory of the loss of her biological family. Many adoptees will forever have trauma that makes them insecure and worried that their sense of safety and security can crumble at any time. She is obviously displaying this to you in the way that a child can and you\u2019re ignoring it. She wants to be loved and reassured and NOT in ways that require her to do errands or chores. She thinks you are requiring to earn your love and attention. Which you 100% are. Unacceptable.\n\nSecondly, she is 14. You have been a teenager so how you\u2019re ignoring how difficult this time is for a young girl is beyond me. A child just hitting puberty wanting time with her mom\u2026girl. Give it to her.\n\nHave you considered doing things she actually likes to do? Your life seems to revolve around your foster child. Could your husband maybe take her to an appointment while you and Lola get ice cream, watch a movie together, go for a walk in a park? Your eldest daughter only gets time with you if she sits in a car.", "YTA. I read your comments; I'm pretty horrified tbh.

She needs an extra one on one day as the other two get a lot of one on one during your errands.", "Hard, hard YTA. You\u2019ve made it clear to Lola that your time and attention is entirely transactional. Unless she does exactly what you want when you want it, you\u2019ve also made it clear to her that you\u2019re fine with neglecting her. Keep this up and she\u2019ll finally decide that she doesn\u2019t want your attention after all and you\u2019ll have single-handedly destroyed your relationship with her.", "YTA.  YTA. \n\nYOU. ARE. T. A.\n\nLola is telling you, in plain language,  what she needs and how she feels. You are disregarding it.\n\nIn 4 years you'll be here asking us why she doesn't want any contact with you.

Eventually she\u2019ll grow up and never want to be around you and it will solely be your fault.", "YTA. Lola is clearly being vocal about her needs not being met and you are willfully and stubbornly choosing to ignore her because she doesn\u2019t want to cave to only getting 1:1 attention  on *your* schedule, which involves running errands involving the other sisters or domestic chore-errands. She\u2019s 14, she wants to spend *quality* time with you where she feels like she\u2019s an active part of the activity. Not following you around like a duckling at a grocery store, or you squeezing in some time for her because your bio daughter is in therapy.\n\nNo where in this post did you say what you do for Lola that actually involves something that she is interested in. All you did was complain about how she doesn\u2019t want to babysit, doesn\u2019t want to run errands with you, and is getting jealous of all the extra time and attention you shower on the other two girls. Lola feels like an afterthought compared to the time you spend with Evie and Katie.", "YTA and based on your comments, it\u2019s clear the time and affection your kids get is conditional on them meeting your schedule needs and helping you with childcare. Now you\u2019re on the internet trying to get us to side with you when your 14 year old daughter is feeling unloved. That\u2019s terrible.", "That poor girl. She probably feels like she only had value to you when she was a cute kid, but you've replaced her with a shiny new kid, now that she has aged out into a teenager that you don't really want to spend time with. She wants you to spend time with her, even though you're being incredibly thoughtless and uncaring. I really hope some of these comments break through your stubborn attitude. You're hurting your child. I've read every comment you've written, you don't have a valid excuse for doing this, or for only spending 1on1 time with her during breakfast every 3 weeks. You can't even throw her a bone and bring her a treat every now and then from your many mommy daughter dates with your oldest. You really suck.", "YTA.\n\n1. You yourself admit that you prefer your other two daughters over Lola. So you admit to exhibiting favoritism. Even though you can come up with a million reasons for behaving this way, as an adult in this situation you are at fault. \n\n2. It is very evident that Lola feels left out. And she is pulling out even more because she feels like she isn't wanted. You could at least try to reach out. Instead, I feel like you are giving up. \n\n3. My dad was a middle child who was cast out because of favoritism. It has always affected his mental health to a point that he still has a lot of mental and physical health issues because of that. Because of that I, my sister and my mother went through a lot of challenges over the years and we still do. And I truly hate my grandmother for this reason and I hate to admit it but I don't wish her well. Please don't be that person. Favoritism among siblings does a lot more damage than you'd realize. It creates generational trauma.", "YTA.  Your child is letting you know she feels less than.  You need to carve out some time with Lola to see what the real issue is.", "YTA. It seems like you don't care about how your daughter feels, and you made this post in hopes of feeling more justified about what you're doing. \n\nYou're being really rigid about how you spend time with your kids.  Is your husband literally never around to watch the kids or run the errands?  I fail to see how the only option for your daughter and you to get one on one time together would have to involve a babysitter.  And is money an issue that you don't want to hire a babysitter? Or do you just feel like spending time with Lola isn't worth your money?\n\nEither way, relationships go both ways.  Sounds like you're headed to a future where Lola rarely visits you after she leaves home.", "YTA. I feel like the only time you offer to hang out with Lily besides once every three Saturdays involves your little one, Katie.

She\u2019s probably longing for more alone time with you\u2014and just you!", "YTA.\n\nBut I think there's a really easy fix for this situation. Talk to Lola, tell her that you acknowledge her feelings and that you want to help her feel valued. And then, together with her, find an activity the two of you can do and that she enjoys more than accompanying you on errands. And find an extra chore that's more up her alley than babysitting and pay her extra allowance for that", "YTA. \n\nIn 10 years, Lola won't have a relationship with you because of your failing to listen to her valid feelings today.", "YTA. You don\u2019t sound like someone who\u2019s fit to be a parent at all; let alone an adoptive or foster parent. Kids aren\u2019t accessories to fit your outfits or schedules. You\u2019re supposed to fit yourself into their needs.", "YTA, it may not be intentional but it\u2019s happening and you aren\u2019t acknowledging it. Your daughter feels less than compared to the other girls, ask her what she wants to do, not just a Saturday breakfast. She clearly loves you and needs your attention, so do something about it before you lose her.", "Although I agree with conclusion of most who commented here, I completely disagree for their reasoning.  \n\nYes, YTA, humongous one, unbelievably so.  But not for semi-trying (note that you are only kinda trying) to treat them equally, paying only when someone does some work, etc., etc.  You are so because it is obvious that you barely have time for two kids (or you do not plan well), yet you are fostering third child while neglecting one of your daughters (adopted or not, she is your daughter).  \n\nWhat the hell were/are you thinking?   Why take third child if you can not take care of the two you have?  You are now doing disservice to all three.   And do not even start me with one breakfast alone with each kid every three weeks?!?  Even without foster kid, that would be one breakfast every two weeks?!?  Are you f... kidding me?   \n\nAnd if you are SAHM and you can not find some one on one time for each kid once a week, than search for the problem in front of a mirror.  Well, take that even without being SAHM.", "From your comments, you're putting all the responsibility on your kid to spend time with you. She has to bend to YOUR needs and wants.

I try to carve out one on one time with 6YO because she spends less time with me as she\u2019s in school. So she\u2019s in Girl Scouts and I go with her and I volunteer for a bunch of shit at her school and at Girl Scouts so that I can invest in HER. 3YO will get that when she is older and their father, my partner and spouse, or their grandparents, or a babysitter will keep the other. Just like what happens now. \n\nKids need one on one time with their parents. YTA.", "Ah the maternal version of Cat's in the Cradle.  \n\nYTA for missing the point and it may cost your relationship with Lola.", "Sounds like Lola needs some more 1 on 1 time. I think you need to sit down and talk with her and find out what\u2019s going on. You both need to be open about what is going on.", "YTA. You shouldn't be adopting another child when you can't fulfill the needs of your existing ones.", "YTA, especially after reading some of your replies. Since you don't seem to be getting the not-so-subtle hints others are dropping, let me spell it out clearly for you.\n\nYou are a bad parent. If you care about Lola in the slightest, YOU need to change something, soon. And since I'm not a complete asshole, I'll even give you some suggestions.\n\nEvenings, after Katie's in bed, do something with just Lola. Evie's 16, she doesn't need to be involved in everything you do at home, so find something Lola likes and do it with her.\n\nFailing that, if you're committed to doing the bare minimum, do something Lola wants to do on the one day a month you deign to spend a few hours with her.\n\nStop expecting your children to cater to your wants, that's not how parenting works.", "YTA. Whether her feelings are valid or not, Lola feels that you're neglecting her. Making an argument out of it isn't going to solve that.\n\nEdit; From your other comments you are failing. You make it seem like either your children find a way to fit themselves into your schedule or you'll just ignore them. Do better.", "YTA, I read the entire post, but the heading was enough alone to determine that.", "YTA, you need to focus on Lola. It would not be good to adopt Katie. Actually both of your older kids are crying out for attention. What 16 year old do you know wants to go to another kid\u2019s doctors appointments?!?!?!  She is desperate to spend time with you.", "Going on errands with you is not spending time with you. \n\nShe doesn't want to go. She wants to do something else. Jesus Christ on a cracker how clear does she have to make it.\n\nYTA. Say goodbye to your relationship with this kid cause once she's 18 she is gone.", "YTA. you need to make time for your kids. Every 3 weeks of one on one time is NOT enough. You should not adopt or foster if you are not prepared to sacrifice to make sure their needs are met. I have three kiddos, and I make one on one time at least twice a week for each kid, doing stuff they enjoy. Sometimes that's a meal out. Other times its playing a video game with them, watching a show they like, or doing a craft. Quality alone time doesnt always mean going out or spending money. The fact that your kid told you shes feeling like she is being left out and you refuse to give her any kind of time unless she goes to do errands is not good parenting. Please do better..", "YTA. She\u2019s adopted and on top of that a middle child. She has told you that she has a need and you are not meeting it. None of what you have said makes her TA but it sure as hell shows your short comings as a parent.", "YTA. \n\nHave you ever heard of the \"Middle Child Trope\"?\n\nYou should start googling it, or even go on tiktok!! Your middle child is feeling soooo neglected and you literally don't even care.", "I was going to say NAH, but after reading through your comments I\u2019m changing to YTA. She\u2019s feeling left out and instead of trying to make her feel more included, you\u2019re not doing anything at all. Worse is that you seem to be going out of your way to justify why you\u2019re not trying to make her feel included.", "Yes YTA. One on one time only once every three weeks is grossly inadequate for a teen. You don't need to do something special or out of the house. Sit in the backyard and talk to your daughter. Multiple.times per week. Be there as a parent for all your kids.", "YTA. This all sounds like a desperate plea for your attention. \ud83d\ude14 \n\nShe is probably acting that way because she not only feels like you don\u2019t like her as much but also actively sees you spending fun time with the other girls. \n\nHave you ever thought about maybe instead of breakfast doing something she wants? Learning about her interests and bonding over those?", "YTA.  What I'm reading is your 14 year old daughter is telling you that she feels unloved and wants to spend more time with you.  Your reply is that she can only do this on your terms, while you're also doing something for one of her sisters.  Soon she won't want to do anything with you, and you'll be wondering why.", "YTA. You hold being lucky to be adopted over that girls head I can just feel it.", "Soft YTA.  Lola is clearly hurting and if you are aware of favoring Evie and not trying to fix that you\u2019re an AH.  Think some family therapy would help.", "YTA \nYou are an adult that can and should be making time to make up for the extra time that the other girls get regardless of the fact that they tag along according to your schedule. It would be different if Lola didn't want to hang out or liked being alone but she doesn't. She wants your love and is very vocal about it. It's kind of cruel to put a stipulation of 'I'll only love you if you come out and do boring stuff with me, and only at precise times that fit my calendar.' \n\nAlso why not take all three girls out every Saturday, maybe not always to breakfast but to do some other free activity like going to the park or something. It increases the amount of time everyone sees you.

Poor Lola.\n\nSoft YTA, you seem like a good mom, but Lola is clearly a really different personality to your other children, and you need to find a way to help her feel included. Evie goes along on errands because she likes doing it, Katie goes because she is so young. You surely wouldn\u2019t want to a bored and resentful Lola to drag herself along too? What does Lola like doing? Perhaps you could find a special set of chores she could do (gardening? Car-washing? Animal care?) that she could do to earn more money, or maybe help her find a little job around the neighbourhood, like paper delivery. And there will surely be a way you can carve out some 1:1 time with her. She\u2019s feeling left out because she is, and she\u2019s 14 and adopted, so this feels huge and hurtful to her.", "You need to talk to her. Take her out to a special lunch and listen. Make sure it is just the two of you. No matter how they became sisters there will be jealous.", "YTA for not recognizing that there's something severe going on with your child and trying to help her.\n\nSure, going on errands with you could give her extra time, babysitting could give her extra money ans that's all not the AH part. But it's clear to everyone reading this that she doesn't feel like an equal to her sister(s) which is something your HAVE to deal with in some way, be it therapy, shopping or going out for lunch, you're not being a very good parent to your middle daughter.", "YTA. Bottom line\u2026you\u2019re the adult and it\u2019s YOUR responsibility to figure out how to make Lola feel more included. Teenagers don\u2019t always make sense.

You may not be leaving her as the odd man out because she's not biologically yours on a conscious level, but one way or another it is clear as day to the rest of us and to her that there is a discrepancy in treatment and regard here.\n\nYour 5 year old getting therapy but not your second oldest adopted daughter? I'm not asking that question for the details on the youngest, I'm pointing out the fact that if you haven't gotten Lola therapy by this point then that's REALLY messed up. We can't guess to the circumstances of her ending up an orphan prior to adoption, but there is basically no form of separation from birth parents that does not leave some degree of trauma on a child including separation *at* birth. I pray that you simply forgot to include that detail because otherwise this is painting a really terrifying picture.\n\nYou don't tell us just how differently you're paying these 2 girls for contributing to the household. **You also say that Lola gets her allowance FROM doing chores around the house. Whereas Evie gets an allowance just because and then gets more on top of that allowance from babysitting.** And you're really going to sit here and tell us that isn't favoritism? What does babysitting for $10/hr look like for Evie? Is it low maintenance with simply keeping the TV on and playing a game or two when Katie is feeling antsy and that's all? Also, you apparently can't spend a minute away from Katie but at the same time Evie is frequently babysitting on your behalf - which one is it actually?\n\n**What do Lola's chores look like while getting paid significantly less than $10/hr apparently? Fair is fair and if you can't pay both of them $10/hr when they're both doing hours of work then you need to either equalize that at a lower amount or stop trying to incentivize them with money so frequently at face-value.

Evie is our biological daughter, we adopted Lola when she was 2, and we're fostering (and planning to adopt) Katie. \n\nI will be the first to admit that I don't spend nearly as much time with Lola as I do with Evie and Katie. Katie because she's 5 so I don't have the option to leave her at home very much, plus she has multiple appointments every week and Evie because she doesn't mind coming along for all of the kid stuff with Katie. I do make a point to get one on one time with the girls. I take one girl out for breakfast every Saturday, we rotate who goes with me. Besides that, the only one on one time is going to be when they tag along for errands. For example, Katie goes to therapy twice a week. 9/10 times Evie comes with me. We drop her off then get coffee and dessert while she's in therapy. When she has visits with her mom Evie and I find something to do in the area. Lola has the option to go to all of these things but chooses not to. She still gets upset that I don't bring her something back. I always tell her you only get something if you go. Evie doesn't get anything when she doesn't go. \n\nThere's also the issue of babysitting. Last year Lola made it clear that she does not want to babysit at all. I told her that's fine. Evie doesn't mind babysitting and usually babysits 3-5 hours per week. I pay her $10 per hour so she gets $30-50 per week on top of her allowance. Lola complains that it's not fair that Evie gets so much more than her just because she doesn't like kids. Lola gets an allowance for the chores that she does around the house but I'm not going to pay her for not babysitting. \n\nYesterday was Evie's turn to go out for breakfast with me and Lola got mad at that too. She doesn't think Evie or Katie should get Saturdays since Evie gets one on one time when Katie has appointments and Katie shouldn't because I'm always with Katie. I admit that I snapped at her because she's been complaining more than usual this week and told her that she has to stop these tantrums. Evie gets more time with me because she chooses to go to appointments or visits with me. Evie gets more money because she chooses to babysit. Katie spends all day with me because she's 5. None of this is a slight to her and the problem is completely due to jealousy from her own decisions. \n\nShe's barely spoken to me yesterday and today and my husband thinks I was too harsh.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

To understand how Lola feels? \n\nShe could send her back into foster care but that's not going to happen. Lola is her daughter. \n\nI'm sorry but children live on their parent schedules & terms always have and always will...parents that don't keep their children on schedules & teach boundries are neglectful...not the other way around.", "Excellent point.", "Start a show together. I couldn\u2019t think of much that my mom and I did that was particularly one on one time but knew it had to be there until I read your comment and it just clicked. Her and I have always had similar interests when it comes to shows and books. We would read the same book and sometimes talk about it when we hit the same area and same with watching shows together. And while my dad was clean before his relapse, we would watch the reality singing show \u201cthe voice\u201d every week and I also went over and just hung out a lot of days after school. Maybe start volunteering at a shelter together. Most have trails for vols to walk the pups and/or fenced play areas. Obviously I don\u2019t know another families interests or allergies. Just a thought I had if they found just sitting and talking to be too intimidating", "When I read the post I felt they had a chance to fix this, but by all of OPs responses I can tell she doesn\u2019t want to make the changes to fix anything. She wants her 14 year old to change. The sad thing is, the 14 year old just wants more time with mom. Normally you see the opposite- the 14 year old pulling away from the parents.", "Evie doesn't mind babysitting but she already babysits 3-5 hours per week, usually on the weekends, and I want her to have time with her friends on the weekends too.", "There\u2019s nothing in her responses here that indicates that she\u2019d be open to advice or changing in any way. She\u2019s done nothing but say the same things over and over again to justify herself.", "Look at her comments, it likely won't", "I implore you to read her other comments and tell me how they fit anything you\u2019ve said. She\u2019s not setting boundaries, she\u2019s showing these girls that her attention is 100% transactional.", "Agreed, this is so sad for the daughter, I can feel the rejection", "INFO: what exactly are you doing when you leave a child supervising another child for 3-5 hours a week while being paid below minimum wage to do so? Especially when you keep emphasizing up and down this thread that you can't dare leave Katie alone for more than 5 minutes at a time when everybody is at home? What is so important that suddenly leaving Katie alone for that long is totally okay but you can't be bothered to allocate some time to Lola?", "Okay. Then for one Saturday find other arrangements for Katie with a sitter. It\u2019s one day. For a few hours. With money that you\u2019d pay evie l can go towards paying someone else. One day.", "Hey OP...Lola isn't Evie! They are entirely different humans, with different wants and needs. Can you not see that?!", "Seems that you don't care, no other option than yours is valid. Is as you think, or it's no valid. Also I come from a large family, 4 kids, the older were not paid to babysit the younger, it's normal help. Your adopted kid, who has already abandon issues, feels left alone, and you as a mother have 0 solutions. Your only solution, is for her to come to your errands. I understand that she doesn't want to come, she wants you to make time for her. If you can't hope your husband does a better job at parenting.", "Yep, that's what makes her TAH.  Just thought I'd throw that in in case it would help her to see what is needed for the sake of the kid.  But alas, we are mere internet strangers, so she is free to ignore us and continue being an AH.", "I could but it's just not that important to me. I sent my words of encouragement. Shes on defense mode at this point. She'll have a lot to think about the next few days...you reap what you sow. One day she may completely be estranged by Lola...thats not any different than many other families or maybe this will be a life lesson learned that she can build on.", "So you\u2019re making positive judgment values about the OP without bothering to look at the things she\u2019s actually. Cool story.", "How about this..youre right...I trust your judgement. I'm not reading 122 comments. Do you feel better now?", "Firstly, you can go to her profile and read specifically the comments she\u2019s made. Secondly, don\u2019t patronize me."]}
