You\u2019re a good daughter for even trying to help in the first place.", "NTA.\nYour father & his wife just wanted free help & they did get that.

When they came to know that they can't survive without your help, they came crawling back.\n\nOh, if it wasn't clear enough, you are NTA.", "NTA - He sounds manipulative, trying to guilt trip you. You on the other hand are juggling so much. You've done alot and you've done enough. You should seek some therapy for grief.", "NTA. Gaslighting and narcissism seem to be the traits your father has in great quantities. He made his bed, let him lay in it.", "NTA- It was unreasonable to expect you to drive hours after a party weekend as the visit could be rescheduled. \n\nOP please go get therapy, for the fact you\u2019re dealing with a ton of grief. Grief from being abandoned multiple times by your dad and the actual grief of losing your dad to cancer.\n\nIf you want to continue seeing him, that\u2019s a personal choice and one that no one should guilt you for, but you don\u2019t have to take your dad\u2019s manipulation tactics to guilt you into visiting him. \n\nAll these things a good therapist can help you with and all above the Reddit\u2019s pay scale.", "NTA - your dad sounds like an entitled jerk.", "Nta. \nOther people's illnesses and how they deal with them are NONE of your concern.

Don't let him.", "NTA..I completely understand that his circumstances right now aren't the best & he's going through the toughest battle of his life, but he has no right to try to manipulate & gaslight you into stopping everything in your life just to appease him. Sucks to say, but he didn't try that hard while you were younger & you don't owe him anything now that you are grown. He sounds totally entitled to you & your time, yet you weren't entitled to having your own father in your life growing up. He chose to get divorced from your mom & then he **CHOSE** not to be a father, he's not owed anything from you now.", "NTA at all.\n\nThis man sounds toxic and selfish and completely unappreciative of what you\u2019ve sacrificed for him despite being an absent father. \n\nCut him out of your life. He didn\u2019t want you before now he only wants you to be his slave. He\u2019s disgusting", "Not the a.hole! \nYour dad sounds exhausting and manipulative.", "NTA. He was asking a lit for someone recently back in your life", "I think you already know deep down that you are NTA, but I also know a parent manipulating/guilt-tripping you can make you doubt your own sanity at times under much better circumstances than this. You said yourself that your niece wasn't interested in going, so it was out of your hands, and so is his reaction. Maybe it's narcissism or maybe it's him not dealing well with the end being so near, but all you can do is work with what you can and right now that looks like taking care of yourself and your husband & kids. Hopefully he'll get his head on straight and reach out while there is still time, and while I wouldn't pin any hopes on it, I (personally) would try to keep things open enough to be able to go and say goodbye if the opportunity presents itself. You have a big heart, and this situation sucks, so do what you need to do to take care of yourself. Wishing you the best the circumstances will allow!", "NTA\n\nYour father is self-centered and selfish.", "NTA but I\u2019m sure you feel bad because the situation is just sad. I\u2019m sorry you lost out on a relationship with your dad, it just feels like a big missed opportunity of life but deep down I hope he knows you tried. You sound like the kind of person who has to hold things up in kind of a dysfunctional family and I can relate to that exhaustion. Sounds like his wife isn\u2019t really helping either.", "NTA\nHe is selfish and only cares for himself. It's better to avoid contact with him.", "Definitely NTA. This man is using you. He wasn't reconciling; he's selfish and entitled, and you owe him nothing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Prior to this diagnosis he has had nothing to do with me, my children, or family for over ten years. He and my mon divorced after 30 years of marriage, he met someone new, and then stopped talking to me even though I kept reaching out and trying. So after this cancer diagnosis I dropped everything to be there for him even sacrificing time away from my young kids and husband to be help him as I live several hours away. Well things were going as well as could be expected, prayers and chemo were working. Then a month ago we had a baby shower for my niece. I had encouraged her to invite my dad and his lady as I wanted to help build a bridge between them as he stopped talking to her too. Well it was discovered that the shower was the same day he got unhooked from chemo. I explained that they could still come but he wanted me to bring my niece down the day before or right after the shower. I spent three days prepping, cooking, decorating, and hosting this shower and could not drop everything to bring my niece two hours away after the baby shower. I was exhausted. Now he is upset, says Im a terrible daughter, i disrespected his wife, and he wants nothing to do with me. He\u2019s not spoken to me in over a month in spite of my attempts to see how he\u2019s doing. But tonight he informed me he is going into hospice as his wife is tired of no help and they will be his family. He blamed me for a panic attack that almost killed him too. I am wondering if I\u2019m the a$$hole. On a side note my pregnant niece didn\u2019t want to go after her shower even if I hadn\u2019t been exhausted.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You are better off without him.", "NTA - Make your peace wtih him then stop talking to him.", "NTA. Time to go no contact - your father is a narcissist.", "This!!\n\nAs I read your story, OP, my brain was paraphrasing. Tell me if any of this is incorrect, please:\n\n*I am a grown-ass adult with a family of my own. A decade ago, my self-centred father cut contact with me and my kids. He reached out recently because he had a bad diagnosis and wanted my help and support. I neglected my own family to run and help him, even though he still has his second wife by his side. Amidst all this, I worked for three days to prepare a baby shower for my niece, but my father threw a tantrum because that day wasn't made all about him. He cut contact with me* *again.* *Now today he is going into hospice and somehow has found a way to make that my fault. Also he called me \"disrespectful\" and wants me to feel responsible because he had a panic attack. The man is dying and still wants to spend his energy laying guilt trips on me. AITA here?*\n\nNo, sweetie, and I'm making up a new acronym for you: DOTA. As in \"daughter of TA\"  ;-)\n\nPlease, if you have any spare time or funds, book yourself that counselling. You need a therapist who can help you deal with grief, loss, learning to set boundaries, recovering from narcissistic parenting, and low self-esteem. It's way, way overdue here.\n\nNTA to the moon and back. Now stop taking all his nonsense onboard, okay?"]}
