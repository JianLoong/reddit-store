We have been together five years and has met my entire family. Our parents have met and got on well. My family are sorta generic white Americans (this is important). As far as I know, everyone liked everyone just fine.  \nLast year my older sibling Robyn (40) came out as trans (MtF). In the aftermath, her marriage of 16 years to Sarah ended. Sarah and Robyn had been together since they were teenagers, so I have known Sarah since I was in elementary school. After the divorce, Sarah and I have remained friends. We chat occasionally and I help her when I can with my niece and nephew.  \nMy niece and nephew will be the flower girl and ring bearer in my wedding. I have, of course, also invited Sarah.  \nRobyn learned about this last week and is furious. She says that she doesn't feel comfortable coming to the wedding if Sarah is going to be there and feels betrayed by me. I told her I am sorry she feels that way, but I have known Sarah my hold life and the only thing \"Sarah\" has done wrong is saying she no longer wants to be married to Robyn if Robyn identifies as a woman and is going to pursue medical transition. Sarah has worked hard to keep the divorce amiable. That I know.  \nToday, my mother called me and said she had spoken to Robyn. Mom says Robyn told her that I was siding with her \"transphobic ex wife.\" I understand this might be how Robyn interprets events. But this is the part I don't get: Robyn told my mom that James had been transphobic to her. I can't imagine when or how since they had never been alone over the past year and James hasn't said much at all to her ever. I told my mom this and my mom said she was unsure because, \"James is from Africa after all.\"  \nI, of course, defended James. I also called Robyn and said I didn't want her after my wedding.  \nRobyn cried. She eventually called my mom and said she had lied about James because she was made at me. My mom says I should give Robyn a chance to apologize. I am standing firm. I don't want here at my wedding.  \nSo AITA for not giving Robyn a chance to apologize and come to the wedding.", "created_utc": 1695780660, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16t7rcl/aita_for_not_accepting_my_sisters_apology/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should have who you want at your wedding. Sarah married a man and it's not transphobic to not want to be married to a woman. From what you have written, at no point has Sarah said anything transphobic. If Robyn cannot be an adult AND lies about your husband to be, you are within your rights to disinvite them. It sounds like they are going through a lot and that therapy might help Robyn deal with their emotions better. It's your wedding and your day.", "NTA \n\nYour sister is 40, not 14. She is not entitled to grace when she makes up disgusting lies about your fianc\u00e9 for the sole purpose of pushing your buttons. She doesn\u2019t get to throw tantrums with the intention to harm people, and then play the victim when her actions have consequences. \n\nLike yes, you should have given Robyn heads up that her ex-wife would be there and had that delicate conversation instead of dropping it on her out of nowhere. Your communication was poor. But that doesn\u2019t excuse her insane overreaction even a little bit.", "Never mind your sister, what are you going to do about your racist mom?", "NTA. Your sister is making everything about her and not being a good parent frankly. If you can't be civil around your ex when kids are involved in something big, then I feel bad for those kids.", "NTA\n\nYour sister dog whistled with racism and transphobia to get her way.", "You need to be considering whether your mom should come. She said she was unsure whether or not James wasn't transphobic because \"he was from Africa after all\" you're having your nephew and niece in your wedding party. It's not unreasonable to assume their mother would also be invited if only to look after them. Robyn only wanted to apologise and admit her lie when she found out that she wasn't invited to the wedding because of it. Ask Robyn to explain why should you accept an apology that you doubt will be sincere. And that if she apologises will not mean she is invited or make you univite Sarah.  NTA", "NTA.  How does your sister figure that her ex is being transphobic?  If anything, it\u2019s the complete opposite.  She is a woman who is heterosexual and attracted to men, she doesn\u2019t want to be married to a woman.  By divorcing, she\u2019s supporting and accepting your sister\u2019s transition by effectively saying \u201cyou are a woman, I\u2019m not attracted to women and don\u2019t wish to be married to one.\u201d\n\nEdit: where I wrote \u201caccepting\u201d I meant \u201caffirming\u201d but I couldn\u2019t think of the word until it popped into my head just now!", "NTA.  Sounds like Robyn's attendance could bring some much unwanted drama.  You don't want that.", "Wow, she broke out a whopper of a lie to get revenge on you. That's not right. Her ex is not transphobic. She is straight and doesn't wish to be married to a woman. That's just the way life is sometimes. It may suck, and it may hurt, especially since Robyn was expecting that Sarah loved the person more than the body, and hoped and expected for her wife's support as she transitioned. However, Sarah is still family, still your sister-in-law of many years, still your friend, and your sister is trying to make you choose. Her unhappiness is understandable, but she crossed an enormous line. She accused your fianc\u00e9 of a really awful thing and I don't know how you forgive or get past it. How do you ask your fianc\u00e9 to forgive that? I mean, I'm livid on his behalf, and I don't even know him. NTA", "You are NTA. You kept sister is trying to manipulate you. You did a great job of spotting it and calling it out.", "Umm the sister is not the only one you should have a problem with. Your mom replied she doesn't know bc he is from Africa! \n\nSo bc he is from Africa he would say something like that? \n\nUnconscious bias is a thing.. Microgressions is a thing. ... And they need to be called out if you are entering an interracial and intercultural relationship.", "NTA. Sarah is not transphobic for not wanting to stay married. Robyn is being a huge AH, and IMO sounds attention-seeking. \n\nYour mom was also blatantly racist to your face about James. This needs addressed asap.", "Robyn doesn't want to be there anyway if Sarah is there. And someone has to look after your niece and nephew during the reception. NTA", "NTA.  Its not 'transphobic' to have a personal preference not to be in a romantic relationship with a trans person, even if you were married to them in their former life.  Robyn needs a reality check - she can't  make such a huge change to her life and expect her partner to just be OK with that.  She also can't go around lying and making false accusations of transphobia against your partner - who is an easy target as he isn't a 'generic white person' which is probably why she picked on him.  As for you inviting Sarah, that is up to you - its your wedding day - its not about Robyn.  Sarah is your friend - you have known her most of your life, and her kids are in your wedding.  If Robyn can't suck it up for one day, then its better she doesn't come at all - she is too much drama.", "NTA. Your sister\u2019s move to try a besmirch your fianc\u00e9 is beyond the pale. I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting the potential drama at your wedding. I think you might want to entertain an offered apology *only* *after* the wedding so she understands that you will enforce your boundaries.", "NTA. She made serious accusations against your husband. She could\u2019ve cost you your future marriage if you didn\u2019t trust and know your partner this well. Robyn needs to get herself together if she wants to be part of your lives going forward.", "Nta\n\nOP has you mother apologised. \"He is from Africa after all\". \n\nPersonally I think your mother may have lost her invite for that comment.", "I mean, if Robyn wants to apologize, you should hear her out, you don't have to forgive her, but everyone should have the chance to right their wrongs. And Robyn's ex is not just a friend, she is the mother of your niece and nephew and the mother of your mom's grandchildren, she should better put some respect on her as well. We wouldn't force someone being gay to be in a relationship with the opposite sex, so why on earth is Robyn's ex transphobic for not \"turning\" gay for Robyn? Insane.", "NTA", "Nta. Robyn is giving trans folk a bad name. \n\nAlso ultimately you get to decide who gets to go to your wedding. I hope it's amazing!", "NTA for how you've handled this, but YTA for saying Sarah has done wrong by divorcing the person who up until his transitions she knew as her husband. She's not wrong to consider this a dealbreaker and she stayed classy throughout.", "I think that inviting someone's ex to a wedding is already a huge sign you don't want them there.", "ESH Robyn never should have treated you like that or made up things about your future husband. That is so immature and hateful, it will be hard to trust her again. \n\nBut I would hate it if my sister invited my ex to her wedding or any family event without asking if I was ok with that. Readers, truly take a second to think about one of your ex's (pick one you are uncomfortable around) and imagine them hanging out with your family talking and laughing - I bet most people would not want to go to that party either...", "Clearly, this is not a post about accepting an apology from your sister, and you are looking for support for your own feelings. Describing the post-divorce period as \u201caftermath\u201d (consequences of an unpleasant situation) says that you have chosen a side.\n\nAs the bride, you can invite anyone you choose to your wedding. As hurtful as it might have been, you should have told Robyn directly that you are not happy about the divorce, and you want to include only Sarah and your nieces and nephews. \n\nTheir marriage was about them. It doesn\u2019t matter how they met, how long they have been together, or how many cherished memories you have with your former sister-in-law. You can be angry and mortified, but it\u2019s not your business.\n\nYou may want to put your energy into your own marriage as it sounds your mother may be carrying bias towards your husband; she\u2019s a \u201cgeneric White American who will say, \u201cJames is African, after all\u201d when the chips are down. She should not have stirred the pot by repeating any remarks Robyn made. Surely, nothing good could come from that.\n\nRobyn behaved badly when she lied. Now, you have your justification for not inviting her, and you also got to make her cry. It sounds like this cannot be reconciled before the wedding, so you should move forward. \n\nOnce you are married, you will better understand that the relationship between spouses is unique to them and while people can choose sides and assess wrongs, their choices are not about the onlookers. May you survive all of your difficulties, learn, grow and have a long, healthy marriage. \ud83e\ude77", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your sister needs therapy and needs to understand that those allegations are not something to be taken lightly.", "Exactly!   Perfectly said!", "Stop misgendering Robyn. The post is incredibly clear that Robyn's pronouns are she/her - calling her \"them\" is transphobic.", "I probably did handle the communication poorly. I just assumed she would assume Sarah would be there. Sarah still came to Christmas last year, for goodness sake!", "I agree, NTA. But interesting comment that she is 40 not 14. If your sister is going through medical transition, which will often involve hormones, it can be a lot like a second puberty; outburst and all. Now this 100% doesn\u2019t excuse your sister\u2019s behaviour, but the mood swings can be real rough, and might be a part of the context here. To be clear, transitioning doesn\u2019t cause lying! But the hormonal context might be helpful to understanding here.", "RIGHT?? \n\nThat's the bigger issue. Both her Mom and sister went comfy into racist assumptions. O boy for the husband-to-be; that's probably the first of many macro- and micro-aggressions he will experience from her family if that's not shut down NOW.\n\nIt's possible it's not even the first and OP is oblivious.\n\n\"He's from Africa after all\"? That thought doesn't come from \\*nowhere\\*.", "This", "I don't think OP meant she was wrong for doing that.

I have literally known her since I was 7 years old. She helped me get ready for my 8th grade dance and my prom. I taught me about boys, makeup, and being a woman in this world. She's not just someone. She is now and will always be a member of my family.", "Kinda See your Point, but in This case\u2026 Sarah did nothing wrong, so why don\u2019t invite her when shes like a sister for op? \n\nShould op have give robyn heads up? Yes.

I am the youngest (by a lot--Robyn is the next oldest) of five. Until last year, I was under the impression I was the only girl. Sarah was my first--and for a long time only sister. The idea I should just stop talking to her is unfathomable to me.", "Yes. I am closer to Sarah than to Robyn and no one had a problem with that until a year ago. Robyn wants us to cut Sarah out. I won't do that. At a very basic level she is Niece and Nephew's mother. Also she has done nothing wrong. She doesn't deserve to be cut off from people who have been and still are her family.", "No instead you'd ghost your sister. \n\nI understand what you're saying. I'm judging you for it. \n\nWe would be over. You wouldn't see me ever again. You can go hang out with my God damn ex.", "At least she hasn't lied about how her new husband treated her.\nGuess the transition takes too much energy to be honest or even civil.\nWouldn't want you at my party either.", "I get the feeling people would appreciate not seeing you ever again. You are extremely negative.", "Wouldnt be a great loss, to lose someone like you who forces other people to dislike people you dislike."]}
