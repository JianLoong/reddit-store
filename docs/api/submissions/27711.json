We have been together five years and has met my entire family. Our parents have met and got on well. My family are sorta generic white Americans (this is important). As far as I know, everyone liked everyone just fine.  \nLast year my older sibling Robyn (40) came out as trans (MtF). In the aftermath, her marriage of 16 years to Sarah ended. Sarah and Robyn had been together since they were teenagers, so I have known Sarah since I was in elementary school. After the divorce, Sarah and I have remained friends. We chat occasionally and I help her when I can with my niece and nephew.  \nMy niece and nephew will be the flower girl and ring bearer in my wedding. I have, of course, also invited Sarah.  \nRobyn learned about this last week and is furious. She says that she doesn't feel comfortable coming to the wedding if Sarah is going to be there and feels betrayed by me. I told her I am sorry she feels that way, but I have known Sarah my hold life and the only thing \"Sarah\" has done wrong is saying she no longer wants to be married to Robyn if Robyn identifies as a woman and is going to pursue medical transition. Sarah has worked hard to keep the divorce amiable. That I know.  \nToday, my mother called me and said she had spoken to Robyn. Mom says Robyn told her that I was siding with her \"transphobic ex wife.\" I understand this might be how Robyn interprets events. But this is the part I don't get: Robyn told my mom that James had been transphobic to her. I can't imagine when or how since they had never been alone over the past year and James hasn't said much at all to her ever. I told my mom this and my mom said she was unsure because, \"James is from Africa after all.\"  \nI, of course, defended James. I also called Robyn and said I didn't want her after my wedding.  \nRobyn cried. She eventually called my mom and said she had lied about James because she was made at me. My mom says I should give Robyn a chance to apologize. I am standing firm.

You should have who you want at your wedding. Sarah married a man and it's not transphobic to not want to be married to a woman. From what you have written, at no point has Sarah said anything transphobic. If Robyn cannot be an adult AND lies about your husband to be, you are within your rights to disinvite them. It sounds like they are going through a lot and that therapy might help Robyn deal with their emotions better. It's your wedding and your day.", "NTA \n\nYour sister is 40, not 14. She is not entitled to grace when she makes up disgusting lies about your fianc\u00e9 for the sole purpose of pushing your buttons. She doesn\u2019t get to throw tantrums with the intention to harm people, and then play the victim when her actions have consequences. \n\nLike yes, you should have given Robyn heads up that her ex-wife would be there and had that delicate conversation instead of dropping it on her out of nowhere. Your communication was poor. But that doesn\u2019t excuse her insane overreaction even a little bit.", "Never mind your sister, what are you going to do about your racist mom?", "NTA. Your sister is making everything about her and not being a good parent frankly. If you can't be civil around your ex when kids are involved in something big, then I feel bad for those kids.", "NTA\n\nYour sister dog whistled with racism and transphobia to get her way.", "You need to be considering whether your mom should come. She said she was unsure whether or not James wasn't transphobic because \"he was from Africa after all\" you're having your nephew and niece in your wedding party. It's not unreasonable to assume their mother would also be invited if only to look after them. Robyn only wanted to apologise and admit her lie when she found out that she wasn't invited to the wedding because of it. Ask Robyn to explain why should you accept an apology that you doubt will be sincere. And that if she apologises will not mean she is invited or make you univite Sarah.  NTA", "NTA.  How does your sister figure that her ex is being transphobic?  If anything, it\u2019s the complete opposite.  She is a woman who is heterosexual and attracted to men, she doesn\u2019t want to be married to a woman.  By divorcing, she\u2019s supporting and accepting your sister\u2019s transition by effectively saying \u201cyou are a woman, I\u2019m not attracted to women and don\u2019t wish to be married to one.\u201d\n\nEdit: where I wrote \u201caccepting\u201d I meant \u201caffirming\u201d but I couldn\u2019t think of the word until it popped into my head just now!", "NTA.  Sounds like Robyn's attendance could bring some much unwanted drama.  You don't want that.", "Wow, she broke out a whopper of a lie to get revenge on you. That's not right. Her ex is not transphobic. She is straight and doesn't wish to be married to a woman. That's just the way life is sometimes. It may suck, and it may hurt, especially since Robyn was expecting that Sarah loved the person more than the body, and hoped and expected for her wife's support as she transitioned. However, Sarah is still family, still your sister-in-law of many years, still your friend, and your sister is trying to make you choose. Her unhappiness is understandable, but she crossed an enormous line. She accused your fianc\u00e9 of a really awful thing and I don't know how you forgive or get past it. How do you ask your fianc\u00e9 to forgive that? I mean, I'm livid on his behalf, and I don't even know him. NTA", "You are NTA. You kept sister is trying to manipulate you. You did a great job of spotting it and calling it out.", "Umm the sister is not the only one you should have a problem with. Your mom replied she doesn't know bc he is from Africa! \n\nSo bc he is from Africa he would say something like that? \n\nUnconscious bias is a thing.. Microgressions is a thing. ... And they need to be called out if you are entering an interracial and intercultural relationship.", "NTA. Sarah is not transphobic for not wanting to stay married. Robyn is being a huge AH, and IMO sounds attention-seeking. \n\nYour mom was also blatantly racist to your face about James. This needs addressed asap.", "Robyn doesn't want to be there anyway if Sarah is there. And someone has to look after your niece and nephew during the reception. NTA", "NTA.  Its not 'transphobic' to have a personal preference not to be in a romantic relationship with a trans person, even if you were married to them in their former life.  Robyn needs a reality check - she can't  make such a huge change to her life and expect her partner to just be OK with that.  She also can't go around lying and making false accusations of transphobia against your partner - who is an easy target as he isn't a 'generic white person' which is probably why she picked on him.  As for you inviting Sarah, that is up to you - its your wedding day - its not about Robyn.  Sarah is your friend - you have known her most of your life, and her kids are in your wedding.  If Robyn can't suck it up for one day, then its better she doesn't come at all - she is too much drama.", "NTA. Your sister\u2019s move to try a besmirch your fianc\u00e9 is beyond the pale. I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting the potential drama at your wedding. I think you might want to entertain an offered apology *only* *after* the wedding so she understands that you will enforce your boundaries.", "NTA. She made serious accusations against your husband. She could\u2019ve cost you your future marriage if you didn\u2019t trust and know your partner this well. Robyn needs to get herself together if she wants to be part of your lives going forward.", "Nta\n\nOP has you mother apologised. \"He is from Africa after all\". \n\nPersonally I think your mother may have lost her invite for that comment.", "I mean, if Robyn wants to apologize, you should hear her out, you don't have to forgive her, but everyone should have the chance to right their wrongs. And Robyn's ex is not just a friend, she is the mother of your niece and nephew and the mother of your mom's grandchildren, she should better put some respect on her as well. We wouldn't force someone being gay to be in a relationship with the opposite sex, so why on earth is Robyn's ex transphobic for not \"turning\" gay for Robyn? Insane.", "NTA", "Nta. Robyn is giving trans folk a bad name. \n\nAlso ultimately you get to decide who gets to go to your wedding. I hope it's amazing!", "NTA for how you've handled this, but YTA for saying Sarah has done wrong by divorcing the person who up until his transitions she knew as her husband. She's not wrong to consider this a dealbreaker and she stayed classy throughout.", "I think that inviting someone's ex to a wedding is already a huge sign you don't want them there.", "ESH Robyn never should have treated you like that or made up things about your future husband. That is so immature and hateful, it will be hard to trust her again. \n\nBut I would hate it if my sister invited my ex to her wedding or any family event without asking if I was ok with that. Readers, truly take a second to think about one of your ex's (pick one you are uncomfortable around) and imagine them hanging out with your family talking and laughing - I bet most people would not want to go to that party either...", "Clearly, this is not a post about accepting an apology from your sister, and you are looking for support for your own feelings. Describing the post-divorce period as \u201caftermath\u201d (consequences of an unpleasant situation) says that you have chosen a side.\n\nAs the bride, you can invite anyone you choose to your wedding. As hurtful as it might have been, you should have told Robyn directly that you are not happy about the divorce, and you want to include only Sarah and your nieces and nephews. \n\nTheir marriage was about them. It doesn\u2019t matter how they met, how long they have been together, or how many cherished memories you have with your former sister-in-law. You can be angry and mortified, but it\u2019s not your business.\n\nYou may want to put your energy into your own marriage as it sounds your mother may be carrying bias towards your husband; she\u2019s a \u201cgeneric White American who will say, \u201cJames is African, after all\u201d when the chips are down. She should not have stirred the pot by repeating any remarks Robyn made. Surely, nothing good could come from that.\n\nRobyn behaved badly when she lied. Now, you have your justification for not inviting her, and you also got to make her cry. It sounds like this cannot be reconciled before the wedding, so you should move forward. \n\nOnce you are married, you will better understand that the relationship between spouses is unique to them and while people can choose sides and assess wrongs, their choices are not about the onlookers. May you survive all of your difficulties, learn, grow and have a long, healthy marriage. \ud83e\ude77", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's going to take a *lot* of work to get past, more than just an apology, so definitely NTA for not wanting her at the wedding\n\nAs far as her (ex)wife being transphobic, other than deciding to divorce her because she's not attracted to women, there isn't really much indication of anything on Sarah's part which could be seen that way. I get Robyn might be upset about Sarah not being comfortable with it, but she kind of needs to recognise Sarah's sexuality is valid and that she's just... not into women. It's an unfortunate side to her transitioning, but it's not really that unexpected", "Transphobia and the mention of it is irrelevant, you have no obligation to forgive anyone.

Not saying none of them would but it is a problem.", "NTA\nWhatever you do,  do not invite Robyn to the weddibg again, she clearly just wants tbe drama.

She sounds incredibly immature. She made up lies about your soon to be husband and her soon to be brother in law.

The ex has done nothing wrong here either. Regardless of whether your sister was being serious or not the fact she's willing to be racist out of anger is still not ok.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think straight people getting divorced from a spouse that comes out as trans is transphobic. SIL was only into men, she accepted that your sibling is identifying as a woman and ended, which sounds affirming not transphobic.\n\nAlso it\u2019s terrible for your sister to make up lies to try to ruin your wedding as a temper tantrum.", "NTA. She invents lies on decent people for her own benefit, including the mother of her children. She will do that at your wedding as well. How many people in your family coming to the wedding knows about her transition? Do you realize just how many problems THAT will cause?", "The thing that gets me here is it would be more transphobic for Sarah to stay in that relationship in which she\u2019d have to still see Robyn as male for her to be happy. NTA op, your wedding you\u2019re allowed whoever you want. Sarah isn\u2019t transphobic", "Congratulations on getting married!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou're definitely NTA. Making a false accusation so potentially damaging,as a form of retaliation against you for not cutting out a lifelong friend is so unbelievably toxic you should think about going no contact for the foreseeable future.\n\nGhanian boy here too. People definitely do like to paint being African as a negative when it suits them. My own friends did the same.\n\nPS: what's james' weekday name lmao", "Nta. She lied about your fianc\u00e9.

Robyn is definitely the asshole here.", "NTA,  Here is the thing, is Robyn sorry for what she said, or sorry she got caught in her lie?

She\u2019s just starting her transition and is basically a teenager right now, and all teenagers are awful.", "NTA, but it sounds like your mom owes you AND James an apology as well, for simply believing James was transphobic because he\u2019s African.

Like did he have a hard time with Robyn's pronouns and stuff?\n\nI'm not saying he's transphobic, but maybe he used the wrong pronouns for her a few times by accident and she was uncomfortable, then when  emotional, called it transphobia thinking it was malicious. \n\nAlso INFO. Did you ask your sister why Sarah was transphobic? Cause there might be more to it than just Robyn being mad Sarah left her.", "NTA. You can invite whoever you want to your wedding.

They are ok to still love their partner as a person because of the history but not want to continue to be with them as a partner because the person they transitioned into isn't their preference. \n\nSecondly for you OP it is ok to HEAR an apology and accept that the person has stated it BUT not accept the apology for what it is nor forgive said person for their actions or behaviors. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your sister lied about your fiance being transphobic which isn't something to be taken lightly. Especially in this time and era when people get hate for saying even the slightest thing against trans people. This allegation could definitely result in something bigger if it got out. Moreover as you mentioned Sarah has tried to amicably proceed with the divorce. She doesn't seem transphobic at all. She would have been rude and mean about it she was in fact transphobic. Sarah's sexual orientation matters as much as Robyn's gender identity. Don't forgive your sister so soon.", "NTA and frankly I would expect her marriage to end. She is a woman, her wife isn't gay, you can love and care for someone who isn't the right romantic partner for you.", "NTA, i find  people weaponizing their situation and accusing of xphobe to anyone who don't side with them disgustung. Sarah is hetero as it seems, so she divorcing her is actually seeing her as a woman, which she doesn't like, so she was respecting her identity. Accussing your fianc\u00e9 was a dick move that was out of the line, as calling mom into this, she has some childish behaviours she should be correcting", "Maybe you can give Robyn a chance to apologize, but you sure as shit shouldn't invite her to the wedding.  Look at all the drama she caused just at the idea of Sarah being there.  Do you really think she is NOT going to cause some sort of a scene at the actual ceremony/reception? with Sarah and an audience actually present.", "NTA.  Any apology will be insincere.  Robyn has a lot of issues to deal with.  I hope the transition includes lots of therapy.  I guess anyone who disagrees with her is not \"transphobic\".  Your poor mom, she's trying to be supportive but she has to be exhausted with fighting all of Robyn's battles.", "I really wish the people who are trans (not all) will stop saying people are transphobic for not wanting to be with someone that transitions. We are allowed preferences without being damned for them. NTA, I wouldn't accept it either.", "NTA - your sister LIED to get her way. You are under no obligation to accept her apology or invite her to the wedding.\n\nAlso - your wedding, you get to choose who is invited or not and everyone else can go pound sand.", "She apologised. She's having a hard time. Forgive her and share your day.", "NTA I think maybe you sister need get work done with a psychology, all this is a big deal and feel like she don't put everything in her head together. And if this is all true and Sarah don't did nothing wrong, just don't see her in a marriage with other woman this is her choice, is not like she need to stay if she don't wanted(and  you  sis lie just for fell like is really mean). Great energy to you wedding \u2764\ufe0f", "Being trans does not protect you from being an asshole..", "There is no evidence of transphobia, but there certainly is evidence of racism. All Africans are transphobic apparently? Lying about someone else in that context is really creepy and makes it unsafe to be around them especially when the family is already racist. There is no way Robin should get to come to the wedding.", "I'm really struggling with some people's logic tbh. \n\n\"My x wife is transphopic because....she's straight\" \nBy her own logic. The x wife should have changed her sexuality for her sake? \nJust so she could be happy?", "Yes.... and the typical trans person, especially one on hormones, is essentially back to a teen level of emotions. They've basically started their lives over, shaken up relationships, and changed everything. Plus if Robyn is on estrogen for the first time... woof, it's a hell of a drug (though apparently fuck-all compared to going on testosterone for the first time - we're all walking around with some really nuts stuff coursing through our veins after puberty). But I also think if you're acting like a teenager, then being treated like a teen is acceptable, and this version of \"grounding\" to take Robyn away from the wedding is pretty spot on to how I'd treat a teen.\n\nSource: I know several trans folks plus I have a psych degree and this was always really interesting to me, however, ymmv - there is no one way to be trans.", "This, perhaos she could have found she was pan or bi and that she still loved her, but it didn't happen, so she went for a gentle divorce, it was one of the best possible outcomes. She respects her life choices, it is just she can't see her accompanying her along them", "I mean, to state that it's plausible that someone from a cultural background known to be socially conservative might have transphobic views doesn't scream racism to me.  \n\n\nThis could have been the same if you replaced African with Russian", "Critical question. Rule number one of inter-racial marriages is to guard your partner FIERCELY against any and all racism from your family.

And intention doesn't negate the impact.", "Guys, the mom is not racist. She is aware. Look up how closed many African countries are towards LGBT. It's obviously not everyone there, but it's to a whole different level than in the west. Do not pretend someone is racist simply for acknowledging that this is a thing that exists in Africa. And the mom didn't go around assuming stuff about the soon to be husband, it was only when the accusation was made by the trans sister.", "Mom is the problem with race here.", "She could mean that maybe there was a culture shock or misunderstanding because he's African, to be fair.", "That's what I was thinking too!!!!\n\nLike OP didn't say why Robyn called Sarah transphobic. **Maybe OP should have asked Robyn about it before inviting Sarah** just saying...", "I grew up in a small town. No one has the luxury of avoiding their exes. Family lives and friend circles are too intermingled.

Grace and patience are key here. Don\u2019t take it personally; she\u2019s very self-focused at this stage of the transitioning process. \n\nTalk with Robyn. Share your heart.

Now the only difference I feel is that there was a different tone in OPs writing, in the mother's approach.

She didn't appear to take the siblings words for granted either, she was talking with OP about whether this could be true or not. Remember, her own child came to her accusing that man of discriminating against her own child. And yet the mother didn't jump to conclusions. It sounds more like she was trying to mentally comprehend how it could even be possible that this man, who she had met and everyone got along fine with, could possibly suddenly turn out to be so hostile and discriminating towards her other child. She was trying to bridge the gap in her mind saying \"maybe it is his background, maybe that could be possible\", because she couldn't otherwise fathom this future SIL suddenly being so out of character. It wasn't coming from a racist, discriminatory or hostile place. She was trying to make sense of the lies and gaslighting that was being done to her, and yet she didn't jump to conclusions. She was having that mature talk with OP. She deserves more credit and understanding than is being given to her in this reddit imo.

But yes, that card wasn't out of nowhere, but it is way out of proportion here.

It's not something she can control or something she should hide for somebody elses sake.

The law does not reflect the people's opinion. \n\nAnd 3/4 of US Americans believe in climate change, so that wouldnt make any sense either. \n\nThe opinion about guns and gun laws would be a better comparison but even then, a slight majority wants stricter gun laws....\n\nCompare that to Poland were the majority of adults under 30 vote conservative / right wing.\n\nAnd the mum didn't just say anything outright. She used his origin as a possible explanation for the transphobia, that she was told he had, by her daughter.", "If you allow the lies now and reinforce that sort of behaviour is acceptable, where does it end?", "NTA. Robyn is clearly making this all about her when it should be 0% about her. If you wanted \u201cSarah\u201d go be your maid of honor that would be your prerogative too. Robyn lied to try to manipulate you, nothing wrong with you cutting that toxicity out of your special day. Just because Robyn has chosen to become part of a minority doesn\u2019t mean she can use it in an attempt to bully into getting her way. I fear what lies she is telling to your niece and nephew", "NTA. Robyn is upset because she expected things in her own relationship that didn't manifest, and she is now taking that out on you.\n\nSarah is not transphobic for not continuing their marriage if Robyn is transitioning. It doesn't mean she doesn't love Robyn and support her. It means that she is straight and doesn't want to continue in a romantic marriage with a woman. Unfortunately, that's a possible outcome of the situation. \n\nOP, who has been a friend of Sarah, and who has Sarah and Robyn's minor children participating in the wedding, can invite Sarah to be there. It's her wedding.\n\nRobyn can feel upset about that. What Robyn doesn't get to do is make up lies about OPs future spouse because she's pissed. That is where Robyn drove the train straight off the No Assholes Tracks into Asshole Gorge.", "INFO: is Sarah transphobic, or just straight?   \n\n\n not wanting to be married to a woman makes sense for a straight woman. Not wanting to be married to a trans person, or possibly some things Sarah may have said about Robyn during the break up, may have been transphobic and terrible. It would probably be a good idea to get more details from both of them.", "And you've nailed disgusting misogyny, good job", "ope, missed that last bit with the disgusting racism. NTA, good for you having James' back", "That's not racism at all. They never said all Africans are transphobic, they just implied the reality that transitions are certainly frowned upon in that culture. There's nothing controversial there.", "What a misogynistic comment", "LMAO you're welcome, not like it's my life experience or anything.", "Oh my god, did you really just say \"that culture\".", "Yup, as in religious culture..", "Or cultures, when referring to the various ones throughout Africa. Did I hurt your feelings?"]}
