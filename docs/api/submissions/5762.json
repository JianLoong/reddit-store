Most of my paternal family was there but the only people relevant to this situation are my dad (49M), his wife Sasha (39F), my sister Jasmine (18F) and her boyfriend Mike (21M).\n\nJasmine is my only full sister and we're extremely close. She's currently 3 months pregnant which obviously isn't ideal since she's only 18 but I'm going to support her regardless. I do not like her boyfriend but he's good to her and able to provide for her and the baby. \n\nSasha has always hated Jasmine. No one has any idea why and my dad prefers to ignore it. \n\nAfter the Christmas dinner, Jasmine, Mike, my dad, Sasha and I were clearly up when Jasmine suddenly felt nauseous and went to sit down. Mike went with her. This is when Sasha decided to begin talking badly about her for being a pregnant teen and for being unmarried. She then started saying that she thinks that Jasmine got pregnant on purpose because Mike's family is wealthy which doesn't make any sense since our family is well -off too.\n\nSasha is known for saying horrible things to get a reaction so I was ignoring her (so was my dad) until she asked me how I felt about my younger sister having a child with someone older than me (literally only 4 months older than me). At this point, I was done so I stopped washing the dishes and I told her to shut her mouth because she broke up my parents marriage. That's when my father finally decided to get involved but I went on and reminded Sasha of the fact that when Jasmine was little, she was in hospital a lot and she (Sasha) was one of the nurses that cared for her on the ward and she began an affair with my father. I also decided to remind her of how her eldest child (my half sister) was born 8 months after she married my dad. \n\nThe situation devolved into shouting and turns out a lot of my paternal family didn't know the truth about how my dad and Sasha met. I ended up leaving and so did Jasmine and Mike and a few other people. \n\nNow, my dad is demanding that I apologize to his wife for embarrassing her and making her look bad in front of the whole family. Now I want an unbiased view on whether or not I'm the AH for rising to my stepmother's bait (her insults to Jasmine) and going lower by exposing her.
