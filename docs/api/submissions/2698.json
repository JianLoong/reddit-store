She should have minded her business and left you alone. She triggered herself, you were trying to feel better.", "Stepdad overreacted. NTA", "NTA. Sometimes when people feel ill that's what have to resort to doing to make our selves feel better. She should of minded her own business and stayed out of the bathroom. Her issues are not yours to bare. It's not like you do it all the time like she did with her disorder. You step dad needs to rethink his crap bc once again. You are not responsible for her or her issues", "So no one is ever allowed to puke ever again? I've been nauseous/sick before and having a puke is sometimes what you need to alleviate that. Your sister shouldn't have walked into the bathroom when she heard you were puking. Eating disorders suck but it's not the world's job to make sure nothing triggers her ever again.", "NTA. This is an unfortunate circumstance and your sister needs extra support if she is feeling triggered. But you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You were feeling sick, not doing it for weight reasons. I would try to explain this to your stepdad and apologize to your sister. However, if he\u2019s this mad it might not be the best time to talk to him. Try talking with your mom if you can.", "NTA. YOU WERE SICK.", "Nta. He overreacted. You didn't intentionally so anything to your stepsis. You were sick. You helped the process along. I do that too... No punishment is warranted for her bursting into the bathroom.", "NTA. Where\u2019s your mom ?", "NTA. And EXCUSE ME??? This man has been in your life for 10 minutes, do who the fuck does he think he is to take anything away from you....especially something you bought for yourself?! Also, his daughter is not your sister, and you are not responsible for her metal health issues.", "NTA- I get she wanted to help you and that\u2019s why she came into the bathroom but a bathroom is a private space so it\u2019s not your fault she willingly walked in and saw you doing that. You\u2019re not responsible for her triggers, especially when it\u2019s to make yourself vomit because you are something bad.", "NTA - there was absolutely no reason for her to go into the bathroom at all.  She heard you vomiting.  If she's that triggered then putting her head under the pillow and chanting to drown out the sound would be a more normal response.  You don't gone an investigate why someone is vomiting with that history unless there is something else going on.\n\nThere is something to be said about lying about sticking your finger down your throat and it would become hearsay because it's not something you normally do.\n\nBob over reacted.  But eating disorders are really hard to manage.  He might have PTSD from it and listening to his child might've triggered something in him.\n\nIf he's someone that you can generally talk to then it might be worth a conversation with him.   If he's not approachable then you'll need to keep your head down till you can move out.", "Info: did you know about her eating disorder before this incident? Either way nta, it sounds like you were ignorant to her disorder and didn\u2019t know that vomiting would trigger it. Also, why did she walk into the bathroom while you were sick? I would never walk in a room if I heard someone was sick. I\u2019d give them a shout to ask if they are okay but I would never think to barge in a watch them throw up into a toilet.", "NTA I have done this exact thing many times because sometimes things you eat don't agree with your body and it's better to just get them out. You need to have a discussion with your mom because this is not okay.", "NTA. No one is responsible for her triggers or PTSD.", "NTA, she wasn't minding her business and invaded your space, that's the only reason she saw something that she didn't want to.\n\nYou shouldn't have even been put into a position where you needed to apologize, you didn't do anything wrong. And it's a problem that your mother only recently got remarried, is harsh with you, and is allowing her spouse to steal from you. Because in this occasion, him taking your object that is privately yours to punish you entirely for his daughter being upset, just reads as theft to me.\n\nWhere is your father in all of this? And also you're 17, are you creating pathways to get out of this situation?", "ESH. you obviously didn't mean to trigger you sister, even if you hadn't locked the door. if vomiting triggers her, it would've been in her best interest to at least knock before going into the bathroom. your stepfather shouldn't have been so angry with you for an accident, even if it had caused damage but you shouldn't have yelled at him.\n\nit could be helpful to look into anger management, coming from a person who does similar things as you have (fight, argue, yell, break things) and has anger management issues. it isn't healthy to get so angry over things, and it can affect your relationships with people. one day your stepfather may not be the teddy bear he is due to this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then it is yours.", "A tip: In future, you can put three or four tablespoons of baking soda in about 8-10 oz of water and drink that and if you need to throw up, that'll trigger it. That was what we did in our family when people were sick but couldn't get the stuff to come out. We all have smaller than typical throat/esophagus and so throwing up was hard even when needed to clear the tummy of bad stuff.", "NTA.

I would speak to your mom about his inappropriate behaviour or look at staying with another family member.", "I may get some grief for this but ESH.\n\nYour stepdad did overreact, at least a bit.\n\nYour stepsister also overreacted. Recovering from an eating disorder isn't easy, but she's not going to be able to go through the rest of her life without seeing someone vomiting. I hope her treatment addresses what she should do when that happens. Also, it doesn't seem that she waited to find out why you were making yourself vomit.\n\nYou should have locked the door, and also closed the door to the toilet/shower closet. As you are 17, you should know of some other possible remedies for your stomach trouble, and you should have tried one of those. They're not exactly *fun*, but they are a bit more pleasant than vomiting.", "\\^\\^this\\^\\^ Step dad is a dolt. This isn't about her, no matter what she or daddy thinks. So if someone pukes on tv, what's he going to do then? Or in a restaurant? Is he going to go around policing everyone. Yeesh\n\nHe needs to get over himself. NTA", "She\u2019s also triggered herself by going in there.", "At 30 I figured out forcing out vomit when your really nauseous is the quickest way to get rid of it. So I think he did the right thing.", "NTA. Hi, recovering Bulimic of 20 years here. No,you did nothing wrong. Part of recovery is working out your triggers and a strategy for dealing with them. People vomit for many reasons. Marie heard what you were doing and she chose to enter the bathroom to see you. If this were a trigger then she needed to walk away or go get your parents if she was concerned about you. She didn\u2019t. Possibly she wanted an excuse to purge herself- OP made herself sick so I should get to, babble babble bulimic reasoning, it\u2019s insidious and gross but that\u2019s how an eating disorder works- or maybe she didn\u2019t realise it would make her feel this bad or maybe she wants attention or maybe she\u2019s trying to control the household by making you all stick to her rules but this won\u2019t work. She needs to speak with her therapist and work on a way to handle herself going forward. Sometimes people are sick and she can\u2019t use that as a weapon or a reason to let herself slip. \n\n\nRecovery is brutal. It takes years. Marie has a long road ahead of her and she needs to work out how to walk it. For starters she can stay out of the bathroom if someone is in there. If you abuse laxatives then you can\u2019t get mad if someone else has the runs. If you purge, you can\u2019t get mad if someone is sick. If you work out for hours then you can\u2019t be mad if you aren\u2019t allowed to do that during recovery. Marie needs to stop looking at others and only look at herself. \n\n\nAsk your mom or stepdad to have Marie\u2019s therapist or doctor give advice on how to help Marie in recovery so you know how to handle things going forward. Make the point that unless you\u2019ve been educated in how to handle eating disorders you won\u2019t know what is right or wrong. And tell Marie to stay out of the bathroom when you are in there. Her eating disorder doesn\u2019t get to run the show anymore and she has no business policing you or intruding on you during bathroom time.", "NTA you didn't do it on purpose, try to explain this to them when they have cooled down.", "NTA. You were in the bathroom alone trying to make yourself feel less sick. It is ridiculous that you were punished for that. Is he punishing Marie when she purges? What did your mom do? Where is your actual dad in all of this?", "NTA\n\nTalk to your mom, because SD is wildly over-reacting.  He needs to apologize for that.\n\nI get why he did it then and there, but it's been a day and he should have had time to realize that you were gonna throw up, you just chose when.  \n\nAnd y'all got to talk to Marie and tell her that triggers are gonna happen and she'll need to be responsible for managing her reactions.  *Which means that if she hears someone puking, not to freakin' go to watch it like pay-per-view.*", "NTA. It is not your fault she has bullimia. It is not your fault that you took privacy in a freaking bathroom and she broke tje privacy even if her intentions were good. It is her fault. It is not ss if you gloated about vomiting in front of her.", "NTA, he overreacted in the moment. Give it a day or two and ask him for a talk (just you two). Talk things through, my guess is he's gonna have a change of heart.\n\nTry to talk boundaries within the family.

If you have a problem like that, then please stay away and get someone to help me instead.", "NTA. It is not your fault she has bullimia.

It was a struggle, but I did it. She needs to be in therapy to work through her disorder and manage her triggers. If she is triggered by someone else throwing up, that is on her, not the person. You are absolutely NTA, and her father is in the wrong. This is her battle, and no one should have to change the way they are for her. She heard someone throwing up and walked in. She violated your privacy, and if she got upset, then that's her punishment for not respecting people's private bathroom time. You don't walk in on people.", "Nta, op you need to tell your dad about this", "NTA, didn\u2019t anyone ever teach this girl to knock? You are NTA for feeling sick. I personally hate the nausea build up until you can\u2019t hold it down. It\u2019s much better to just get it over with. \n\nTalk to your mom. Your stepdad is out of line. He shouldn\u2019t be punishing you because you were I\u2019ll and his daughter has no manners. You didn\u2019t trigger her, she did it to herself.", "NTA this is exactly what puking is for, to rid your body of something you ingested that it can\u2018t handle", "OP NTA and if you have to make yourself puke again just put a couple of tablespoons of salt in a small glass of water and scull it down. It will make you barf with no fingers required", ">She should have minded her business and left you alone.\n\nMaybe she thought OP was sick or was throwing up because he was sick and came to check in on him", "Regardless of if he knew all the details about her disorder or not, he\u2019s allowed  puke. He was in the bathroom with the door closed. \n\nI understand she was probably just wanting to check on him, but recovering bulimic or not she should have knocked on the closed door first before just entering. Better yet, being she knows her own triggers she should have gotten her dad or stepmom to go check on him instead. \n\nI\u2019m sure stepdad is more scared than anything & unfortunately is taking it out in OP. Hopefully once he\u2019s calmed down he\u2019ll come to his senses.\n\nNTA OP. Maybe try talking to your mom about what happened & she can explain it to stepdad. Sometimes when you get really scared you stop thinking properly & it takes someone not involved in the situation to get through to you.\n\nEdited: wording", "Sister deliberately comes into a bathroom that\u2019s clearly occupied, and OP is the asshole for not locking the door? Yeah, that makes sense \ud83d\ude44", "She has a puking related eating disorder, she could have just knocked or sent one of the parents. She meant well but also did risk exposing herself to triggers.", "NTA but your mother sucks for allowing it", "NTA... I hate this trope in movies, I hate it in real life. She knew the door was closed, at minimum, you knock.", "When I\u2019m ill I also have to make myself sick, so I know how bad it feels to need to be sick but you can\u2019t. Sometimes it gets really bad where you\u2019re in severe pain because of it. Essentially, your step dad is choosing to ignore your pain and get angry for bringing up someone else\u2019s bad memories. Plus you didn\u2019t even do it in front of her, she walked in on you, that\u2019s on her?", "Or has a baby", "Oh for sure. I'm just saying the minded her business part was unnecessarily mean. It may have been a bit dumb but it came from the right place"]}
