I do have a new job and feel a societal pressure to dress nicer, but going into a store and trying on endless amounts of clothing to try to find what fits my new body is a kind of anxiety hellscape that I cannot even begin to attempt.

What does any of this have to do with wokeness, which is about racism?", "I think people just project fictional versions of themselves on Reddit.", "Women: my man is dressing like a schlub! \n\nPublic: you go girl! Whip that man into shape. Make him clean up his act. We\u2019ve green lit several make over shows based on this premise. \n\nMan: I want my wife to dress better. \n\nPublic: evil sexist control freak! Die you scum. *lights pyre and sharpens pitchforks*", "I'll do the rare thing of having a nuanced opinion on Reddit. \n\nYou're being intense about something most people don't really care about. And it's ultimately her body, she can drape whatever cloth she wants over it. \n\nShe's being stubborn about not acknowledging weight gain by avoiding \"officially\" going up in pants size. And even if they don't fire her (which is unlikely they will), people are judged by appearance very heavily during first impressions and you want to make a good impression. It sucks, it's unfair, but study after study shows, people judge the book by the cover. She is not going to change society by dressing down to her new job. \n\nNeither of you are assholes, both of you are being dramatic.", "You kind of are TA.. her body her money her clothes her choice.", "She may not get fired, but it can affect how people view her. Clothes that don't suit the position make the wearer seem less professional, which can then affect their credibility and thus their general reputation and chances for promotion etc.\n\nIt often isn't even that people are actively thinking \"oh, look at her clothes... she's so unsuited.\" It just kind of happens in the background of the brain and isn't intentional or malicious.", "They actually do fire people if they are inappropriately dressed and have to be asked multiple times to dress in proper work attire.", "OP never said she was asked to dress differently.", "I think the point was to show her lack of self awareness when it comes to appearance", "We don\u2019t know what his wife\u2019s occupation is. I am a woman in my mid-forties who is an investment advisor at a global firm. We are *never* allowed to dress informally unless we\u2019re in the office on the weekend when no one else is around. I\u2019ve been in this industry for two decades and I\u2019ve never seen anyone walk around without dressing professionally.", "He didn't say they hadn't either and if she barely went back it may catch up with her but that's irrelevant. You said they don't fire people for their attire and it absolutely does lol.", "He says that she gained weight due to multiple health problems.. not because her lack of self-awareness. Which makes him double the AH because he is embarrassed of her weight and he knows it's because of health issues.", "After warnings. They don't just fire a good employee for dress. That would be highly unisual. You also said after warnings. So, you know I'm right.", "I think you just read the parts you want to, to get yourself upset \n\nI said lack of self awareness of her appearance, ie: her stomach hanging out of her shirt. And he was embarrassed of her looking like a disheveled mess in clothes too small for her\n\nShe can be fat, he didn't tell her she needed to lose weight. He just wanted her to wear clothes that fit.", "Lmao no you know you're wrong now because you have some ridiculous notion in your head people can dress how they want when they want. They can but consequences could follow. It's ok to admit that yes they can be fired for it. Your bad. Its ok we all make mistakes just grow from it.", "Nonsense. Her employer has not said it's an issue. OP is making that up to control her.", "Fun fact! She knows her job better than you.", "YTA do you actually know the dress code of her work place or are you just assuming you know better?\n\nMost places were going business casual prepandemic.  She could be working in a modern sane office that doesn\u2019t care about superficiality.", "YTA. Why the whole back story about her weight gain, belly showing etc.?  It's not relevant, because now her clothes fit but you want her to buy new clothes because you don't think they're professional enough.  Seems like your passively fat shaming your wife, and now you still want to control what she wears.  I highly doubt she'll be fired for wearing clothes that you deem not professional enough. Worst case, they'll mention it to her and then she can go buy new clothes, but even that seems unlikely. Leave your wife alone, let her dress herself.", "YTA. Just admit it, she\u2019ll never be good enough for you. \nWhy not focus on yourself instead of what fabric your wife puts on her body?", "As a middle aged woman who gained 35 pounds due to age, pandemic and mostly the hormone replacement therapy medication that I have to take for 5 years to help prevent breast cancer recurrence I understand. I was one of those lucky people who has always been petite. Could eat whatever I wanted. And after having three kids still just lost the baby weight. Luckily my husband and our three sons have all been kind about my weight gain because they know how embarrassed I am. What bothers me is when you said she\u2019s lost a lot of weight, fits into her old clothes and that is a relief to \u201cus\u201d. Why is that a relief to you? I understand loosing weight and being healthy but again why is her weight loss a relief. It\u2019s not a relief because you still want her to purchase new clothes. Why?", "YTA Maybe if you listened to your wife you would be less of an AH", "YTA You care more about appearances than about her. If they don't have a problem with her clothing then what she wears is fine. Focus on your own appearance and maybe she'll be motivated to switch it up, but stop pushing and just worry about your own clothes.", "How bad are these clothes? YTA, unless it\u2019s a bikini or yoga pants and a tank top\u2026 she ain\u2019t getting fired!", "YTA. Stop judging your wife.", "Depends on how bad these clothes are. If they\u2019re just not considered professional enough for OP, then OP is TA. If they\u2019re actually clothes inappropriate for work, like leggings or hoodies, then OP is trying to be helpful. You don\u2019t generally find out your company has a problem with your work attire until you\u2019ve already been passed over for promotions and work opportunities.", "Eh, I say this as someone who has difficulty buying clothes my size in normal stores, it shows that she has low self-awareness of her appearance related to clothing. People are 100% allowed to gain weight without being shamed, but they should also wear clothes that fit in public.", "I\u2019m sure what her weight fluctuations have to do with any of this: absolutely nothing.", "No it\u2019s because businesses have been incorporating business casual pre pandemic.\n\nBecause only boomers and bootlickers think you need to be suited up for office work.  Client facing or jobs where you\u2019re appearing somewhere like court are different.", "This is very true, and studies have shown that people are more likely to judge women on their appearance than men. It\u2019s not fair, and it\u2019s not right, but it doesn\u2019t make it any less true. Any woman of less than the average beauty has seen it played out.", "I recently saw a depressing study that showed heavy women can increase their salaries more by losing 60 lbs than by getting a Master\u2019s degree.", "If she gained weight and was feeling self conscious, I'm sure she was very aware how she looked.\n Edited to say: he says at the end she fits in her old clothes because she lost weight after. \nShe might be using that as motivation to keep the weight off. \nShe might want to avoid going in person and thinking about how her body changed.\nShe also might just be waiting to see what the dress code is like and what she actually needs.", "I wonder if OP would be embarrassed if his wife were petite and wore a belly shirt that showed her stomach.. He very clearly was relieved when she lost the weight. \"She's lost a lot of weight in the past 6 months and is able to fit into her old clothes, which was a relief for both of us.\"  So it was obviously about her weight.. but go on and tell me again how I'm the one who is only reading the parts that I want to. Lol.", "NTA but maybe change the approach since she isn't seeing it from your angle. But also be aware that she is still conscious  about her appearance and might be willing to change because you say so. She sounds like she would rather be comfortable than being aesthetically pleasing for the workplace.", "NTA - it depends on the job but seriously wearing some nice slacks and a decent button up shirt is not going to kill someone. They forced people to wear 3 piece suits and ties back in the day. Having to look relatively put together and well groomed for an office job is not going to kill you.", "YTA. Stop harassing her about her clothes.", "NTA, what you mention is totally reasonable, especially if it's a brand new work place where no one knows her.", "YTA.\n\nYour wife knows what kinds of clothing are appropriate for her work place.  At my company, if someone shows up in a dress shirt and khakis, we all know they're interviewing for a new position because they're overdressed.  My direct Senior VP wears polo shirts and jeans.  Our C Suite execs dress fancy, though - slacks instead of jeans.\n\nIf she's truly dressing below company standards, her boss will talk with her about it.", "NTA. I would look into booking an appointment at one of the higher end retailers with a shopper. They have folks who will help her finding clothing and make it a good experience. You can gift her a certain amount of money (on account at the store) and let it be a day where she gets pampered.", "Yeah, I love how OP goes on about weight, which has nothing to do with the story, but leaves out critical details of what her role is and what her current attire is. So I just assume OP is YTA.\n\nIs OP customer facing now when she wasn\u2019t before? Is there some other reason beyond \u201cstatus\u201d that she should dress nicer? Attire expectations have shifted hugely in the last few years\u2026 athleasure and jeans are now acceptable at many companies.\n\nIs she wearing hole rags? Is she wearing cloths with crude graphic on them? Or are they just not designer wear?", "You're giving her lots of assumptions and your not affording him the same amount of assumptions\n\nShe might also be a lizard person from Mars, who knows, were missing lots of detail. \n\nOr, maybe she wasn't playing 4d chess and hiding a secret about her clothing motives. And simply got offended by OP when he made a comment about her clothes, and now if she changes her wardrobe she'd be admitting he was right - ya know, the typical bullshit that couples do.", "That's because I'm not replying to OP, I'm saying that your comment that she is unaware how she looks, probably isn't the case. \nI'm not assuming OP coming from a bad place, but  pointing out that assuming she isn't aware is probably very inaccurate. Women are always told to be aware of their looks. It's highly unlikely she's unaware and much more likely that there is something else going on.", "Oh my you are dense. Could it have been a relief because her belly wasn't hanging out of her shirt anymore maybe? At least this time instead of only reading the parts you wanted, you put the effort in to to completely misunderstand it. I can only imagine how you are about real world situations....", "No he probably wouldn't be, because a belly shirt is designed to look that way. Instead, she looks like a goofball 17 yo boy who refuses to stop wearing his favorite comic book shirt that he got when he was 12. \n\nAnd yes, I'm sure the woman and him are relieved she will likely live to see the age of 65 now. Congratulations to the both of them.", "Wokeness is not about racism. I'm a black Canadian woman, I don't believe in the woke agenda. I don't believe it's to help POCs.", "\ud83d\udcaf", "Nice try troll. You obviously have no reading comprehension skills if you can't see that OP has an issue with his wife's weight. But I'm going to assume you're like most mouth breathers on here and just spew a bunch of nonsense in the comment section to get a rise out of people because you have nothing better to do with your life. I can't even imagine how you are in real world situations.", "Who says she wasn't wearing a belly shirt that was designed to look that way? Sounds like you feel like it's acceptable for a petite woman to wear clothes that show skin but it is not acceptable for an overweight woman to wear clothes that show skin. That's pretty shallow and you've proven my exact point so thanks for that.", "Who says she wasn't wearing a baby diaper and no top?? Maybe that's what he meant by her stomach was showing?!?!  ..... Give me a break, you know she wasn't. As you already said, she probably had body image issues after gaining weight and who with body image issues is wearing clothes to expose skin on purpose? \n\nYou're trying to shift the argument from this one person, wearing a shirt that's too small for them, to a battle on societal bias against fat people.... Grow up and calm down. It's okay if a fat person wears a shirt that looks bad on them, the world won't implode."]}
