I do have a new job and feel a societal pressure to dress nicer, but going into a store and trying on endless amounts of clothing to try to find what fits my new body is a kind of anxiety hellscape that I cannot even begin to attempt.

As long as she is respectfully dressed and decent, then build her up as doing a great job.
