Why do you ask when it\u2019s you that broke it!\u201d \nI try to clean it up quickly as I know we need to go.

The typical \u201cwoman\u201d clich\u00e9 is nagging wife", "Yes the conspiracy of putting cologne somewhere where someone will break it becauseee.... Idk because that's pretty stupid", "Didn't say nagging now did I?\nBut you're quite happy it seems to ignore one person's behaviour, and make baseless assumptions on someone else.", "I\u2026 didn\u2019t say you did? I was pointing out a different clich\u00e9. Did you hop on Reddit today with the expressed purpose of finding something to be mad at?", "You don\u2019t know what a narcissist is if you think that suggesting someone might be abusive is a sign of it. And if you really don\u2019t see a problem with the husbands behavior, I will assume that\u2019s because you would react the same way in the situation. So let me give you the same advice I would give OP\u2019s husband if he came on here- get professional help asap. His behavior is [textbook emotional abuse](https://www.thehotline.org/resources/what-is-emotional-abuse/). [Literally.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/emotional-abuse) And since you seem confused about what narcissistic behavior is, [here\u2019s this.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662)", "I went on their comment history and they\u2019re consistently argumentative and won\u2019t listen to any kind of reason \ud83d\ude2c", "[removed]", "Get the perfume and dump him", "As a fellow Dane... It's also just not true??\n\nThe free healthcare part is, obviously, but especially since Covid people have gotten waaaay more \"prickly\" about people coming into the office sniffling or coughing all over the place while on the bus/train. I can't imagine going to a social event feeling that unwell\n\nDanish people don't just go all over the place while sneezing on everything in sight lol", "You said this better than I ever could. I've been OP (if what you're insinuating is accurate) and I'm a dude. It's an absolutely miserable place to be. OP, replace perfume and then spray it everywhere to act as a makeshift ninja smokescreen and beat a hasty retreat!", "Yes but also op deflected and tried to make it his fault instead of simply apologizing and offering to replace it.", "Also why tf would you put things in Front of a sliding Box that gets used often?! .\n\nESH op but do replace the perfume and tell your husband to grow tf up and also take responsibility for his actions. His perfume bottle shouldn't be in front of your box.\n\nAlso  when possibly sick stay home . He can do what he wants, you be the reasonable one and don't get other people sick", "Even on top of that, instead an apology she blamed him by asking if he put that in front of the container. \n\nI would have apologized. Even if it was in her space, it sounded like it was right in front of her. Her priority was pushing off blame and financial responsibility instead of empathy and support. \n\nI tend to turn into mush if someone is genuinely upset over an accident and offers to help. Hell, I\u2019d probably say \u201cwhy don\u2019t we go halfsies since I shouldn\u2019t have had it there anyways.\u201d But if someone is instantly pushing off blame and shows no remorse, yeah, I\u2019d be pissed and probably say, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s best I go and see my friend since you aren\u2019t feeling well.\u201d It makes no sense to go see friends when there is obvious tension.\n\nFor the situation based on her immediate reaction, I\u2019d say YTA. If I broke my SO\u2019s expensive cologne, I really couldn\u2019t stomach replacing it\u2026but I would definitely immediately apologize and offer regardless of where it was. Even if they didn\u2019t have the funds, they could get a travel size for them to use while they saved to replace it.\n\nFor going to the friends, it\u2019s hard to tell if she was pushing to go or her husband.", "So stay home. Don't get anyone else sick ffs", "It means everyone sucks here", "I'm scratching my head on that bit.\n\nIf I stashed an expensive bottle of fragrance in my husband's medicine cabinet or toiletry drawer unbeknownst to him, that bottle would very likely end up accidentally shattered on the bathroom floor. Hubby didn't know that I stashed my bougie smelly water in his space, nor would he expect it to be there in the first place. That broken bottle would be my own darned fault, and I wouldn't have anyone to be mad at, save for myself.", "Ok, she should replace the bottle and than leave that AH.", "She didn\u2019t break it just because it was on her shelf. She wasn\u2019t expecting it to be there in the first place.", "Lmao idk man that might be city white people I'm a dude from the south they eat mad spicy foods", "Whenever I've lived with someone, I've never put my shit on their side (or shelf) of the medicine cabinet. It just seems very odd that he would do so, especially when she is sick & not functioning at 100%. I am wondering if he makes a habit of doing things like this, just so he can scold & belittle her.\n\nI have a friend whose ex would put things right behind her tires and then would scream at & berate her when she'd back over them.", "Really? To be fair I guess I didn\u2019t go very far south but Texas and Arizona seemed more keen on their sugar rather than spice. Could have been restaurants noticing my reflective strip white father tho.", "You are only suggesting he is abusive as a cop out to avoid responsibility. Which is narcissistic behavior - along with manipulating therapy speak. \n\nAll his behavior suggests is that he was stressed. Her behavior suggests she would rather blame him than apologize for breaking his stuff. \n\nWhen you damage someone else's stuff you don't get to then tell them how they are allowed to feel. How hard is it to just apologize? \n\nOf course, being a narcissist, apologizing isn't even something you considered.", "You and your husband are AH's.    No clue why you panicked.   You're crybabies.   Quite an outburst don't ya think?  \n\nDoes it really matter who broke the cologne?", "What does free healthcare have to do with anything. There's no cure for the flu and if you infect someone who are immunocompromised you can kill them. But apparently that's not so serious because free healthcare. Is2g, you're all a bunch of plague zombies.", "Reddit is wild.", "Most people just love being plague zombies and infecting others. No one really seem to care anymore.", "She probably spends a lot of time apologizing to her husband for all sorts of things.  I think that's why she posted to reddit.  But, by all means, focus on the important job of assigning blame for the broken bottle (placed in front of her drawer).", "She said he threw a tantrum and refused to go out afterward\u2026. Literally a petulant child", "The silent treatment is emotional manipulation, not to mention immature. It sounds like you both handled that badly.", "I've placed things in obvious wrong spots plenty because I autopilot a lot. So it does happen. \n\nHell I've done something like that and 100% not remembered doing it because I was thinking about something else. Lol", "I'd get him a new one bc. I broke it BUT what triggers me more is the fact that he wanted to drag you outside the house when you were visibly ill and not up for it. I would not be this understanding if I was feeling sick. NTA, the husband seems immature as hell. Also, why was he using your cupboard if you have separates. I had an ex like that in my 20s. He really wanted to eat at this fancy restaurant in \"walking distance\". He got lost, dragged me 4 km in the middle of summer, I was begging him to please go back bc. I was getting sick and exhausted and he didn't care. Ends up, the restaurant was closed lol and we had to walk back. We ate at another place and went back to his place, where I got sick. Was the restaurant more important than my well being? Yeeeees. I was visiting him in another country, so I couldn't just leave bc. I was dependent on his car/house but I took that as a red flag.", "I see you learned nothing from the pandemic. ESH, you for agreeing to expose your husband's friends to your illness and your husband for wanting to to infect them in the first place. Aside from that, this relationship sounds super unhealthy. I'd talk to a therapist about this. After you're no longer contagious.", "Ty", "You shouldn\u2019t store fragrance in the bathroom, the heat & steam from the shower will ruin them.  Store in a cool, dark place if possible. Also ESH.", "It's not there's nothing to talk about this is why I think alot of people lack critical thinking skills \"person breaks bottle ~ we both know you can't replace it  so u say nothing but are upset but you know there's nothing u can do~ before you say anything you get gassed lighted \"it's your fault for putting it there\" at what point in these series of events is there space to talk?", "Why does he wear perfume"]}
