I guess for a while Adam Sandler or Rob Schneider had some movies with a very tall actress that was referred to as a big bitch.  \n\nI (28) started dating my wife (25) six years ago.  She was quite young when we met so we waited until she was done university before we got married.  We were long distance for most of our relationship because after I graduated I got a job in a city away from the university we met at.  \n\nAbout two years into our relationship we knew we were going to get married.  And so I brought her home to meet my family.  We are Latino and I am the one that sticks out. I am 6'1\". My brother is taller than my parents and he is 5'8.  \n\nMy wife is 6'3\". She played NCAA Division I volleyball. She is obviously also incredibly athletic.  \n\nFor some reason my brother, who was 38 at the time, decided the best way to make a good impression on her was to put on a weird voice and say \"Damn that's a big bitch\". \n\nI doubt very much that it was the first time she had heard this. But she was meeting her boyfriend's family for the first time.  She was really hurt.  \n\nMy brother didn't apologize. He just said it was a joke. My parents were embarrassed by him and his wife called him a dumbass.  Even his kid, my niece, looked like she wanted to hide under the carpet.  \n\nWe had nothing to do with my brother after that.  We invited him to the wedding but he wasn't in the wedding party or seated with the family.  He and his family were in the wedding pictures.  \n\nThis year my wife and I are having our first child and we bought our first home. We had a housewarming party and we chose not to invite my brother.  \n\nHe called me up and said I was an asshole to exclude him over a joke he told four years ago.  I asked him if he would be willing to apologize in front of everyone at the party.  He said he wasn't going to apologize over a stupid joke. He said I was trying to cancel him with the family.  I said my niece and sister-in-law were welcome. Just not him until he publicly apologized. \n\nMy parents want me to make nice.  They said that he is literally from a different generation than me. I said that I worked with lots of Gen X people who had manners and shame. They aren't trying to force anything but I know they are sad about the split between my brother and I.  \n\nMy parents are sad and my brother is calling me an asshole for not having a thicker skin.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670537255, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgde2u/aita_for_refusing_to_be_around_my_brother_because/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems like he's doubled down on that repeatedly since. \n\nA public apology isn't about him being contrite though - it's a power play. Is that what your wife wants or what you want? If it's what you want, you're probably getting in the way here.\n\n\nHe needs to apologise sincerely to your wife - if she wants to hear it. Ultimately this is her decision.\n\n\nIt sounds like your parents are enabling him. The \"different generation\" crap doesn't fly.", "Start calling him a Big Prick at every opportunity and see how long it takes for him to get bent out of shape, and when he does, just tell him it's a joke bro", "NTA. I am South American. If my brother said that to my wife/fiancee/girlfriend/friend/booty call it would go farther than a snub.", "NTA - you house and your choice on who to invite.  The truth is age does not excuse bad behavior.   He should apologize and your wife should be the one to determine public or not and whether she can forgive him.    If he doesn't have the maturity at 42 to apologize, then he shouldn't be in a social situation with you and your wife.", "NTA. It was a rude thing to say, but could have easily been resolved *four years ago* if he\u2019d just owned it and apologized.\n\nAnd it can be resolved now the same way! If your parents want this to be mended, they should bother him about why he\u2019s taking years to apologize. Is he that insecure that he can\u2019t acknowledge when he\u2019s messed up? What a joy his marriage must be \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA.  Good on you for defending the honor of your wife.", "NTA. He humiliated her pretty publicly and the apology needs to match, as well as reflect the fact he's dug his heels in for four years. 42 is hardly old enough to be an excuse.", "NTA. \n\nThat he wouldn't immediately realize that his joke bombed and apologize is why.   It's not *your* skin thickness that's at play here. \n\nHe insulted your wife, and he's too scared to apologize to her?  I'm guessing his skin is pretty fragile. \n\n\nThat he won't apologize NOW is even more telling. You're not \"canceling\" him, he's doing a fine job of that himself.", "So either your brother can insult everybody without apologizing, or you're the asshole?\n\nHeads, I win; tails, you lose. \n\nFuck that shit.

No. It's bullshit.\n\nTell him, I'm not cancelling you. You cancelled yourself, if that's what you feel is going on. Now, you've added insult to injury by insulting me. I will not be bullied into accepting that your disrespectful and demeaning behavior is tolerable. The fact that you still hang your hat on \"it's just a joke\" is an indicator that you could very well do it again and therefore you most certainly are not welcome.\n\nTell parents the same thing and that if they have breath or energy to spare, then it should be directed at him because the only thing you want to hear about it is an apology. Every excuse made just makes it worse. Only he can remedy his error, without acknowledgement and apology, no forgiveness is available. But the hole can get deeper.", "NTA \n\nThis isn't generational. It has nothing to do with gen x. It has to do with your brother being an AH.\n\nThe apology doesn't need to include people who were not present during the insult. You will just make a whole lot of people uncomfortable who don't want to participate. Include the people who were there and make sure the apology will be sincere and humble.", "You\u2019re NTA!! Your parents are asking you to sacrifice your peace for the family peace. The way that \u2018cancelling\u2019 language has made its way into interpersonal conflict is hilarious and ridiculous. You\u2019re not cancelling him, and he should obviously apologise to your wife. It doesn\u2019t seem like he brings anything to your life, and his inability to apologise for so many years is a pretty solid indicative of his openness to change (none), remorse (none), and respect for your wife\u2019s feelings/basic kindness (none).", "NTA-He\u2019s from a different generation is just a bullshit excuse to try and excuse someone acting like an asshole.

He cannot handle the potential that others will think he's weak for apologizing for being unacceptably rude to your wife.", "NTA, he knew better, he was just being a jerk.  Besides, who quotes Adam Sandler anymore?  That's so passe. Besides, those movies were terrible then, now they're completely cringe material.  He does need to apologize to your wife and learn to mind his manners better.", "NTA - Just because someone is technically related does not mean you have to have relations with them.

Your brother wants everything his own way and is upset that he can't. Maybe he could grow thicker skin.", "NTA\n\nErrrr what has his age got to do with it? Your parents didn\u2019t swear at her? So why is a thirty something adult excused? \n\nHe needs to apologise and GROW UP", "I think NTA bc you and your wife are allowed to make that decision.

It is understandable that you do not want to be around someone who has shown such disrespect to your spouse, and you have every right to exclude him from events if you choose to do so.

You are not obligated to forgive him or be around him if you do not feel comfortable doing so.", "NTA he can\u2019t even apologize then or now he\u2019s the AH . You don\u2019t need him in your life brother or not.", "NTA - all you\u2019re asking for is an apology and acknowledgment that what he said was hurtful.", "ETA\n\nI think you should make him understand that his comment hurt your wife and make him apologise TO HER. He obviously wasn't trying to be hurtful and maybe he doesn't understand that he offended her so you should explain that to him and ask him to apologise to her instead of everyone.", "NTA, that said just apologizing to your wife should be enough but eventually there will be an other joke of the same kind about you, your kid or your wife. If you can't deal with it then don't bother having him around.", "NAH i guess\n\nWhat he said was cringe but everyone fully understands it was a joke and not even meant to be offensive. You admit that you fully\nunderstand that.  \n\nSo you want him to apologize publicly for making an unfunny joke. Why? Some kind of weird power play? Or your wife is truly offended? What else will offend her into shunning people? All unfunny jokes or just all unfunny jokes aimed at her? Maybe you should write a list of off limit topics for him to sign when he apologizes.\n\nYou are allowed to be offended so I guess your not an asshole. Your brother is allowed to tell cringe jokes so i guess he\u2019s not an asshole.\n\nIf I was your brother I\u2019d just say sorry and get it over with but it sounds like you are both stubborn.", "ESH. He owes your wife an apology, but I can't see how improving the relationship is going to happen if you force it to be a public one. Back off on that demand. I'm betting he still won't apologize. Please tell your wife not to allow your brother to make her feel as if she was wrong to have hurt feelings or to let you have any part in whether she decides to forgive him if he apologizes.
