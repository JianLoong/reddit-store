I \\[28M\\] got engaged to my girlfriend \\[27F\\] about two weeks ago after dating for 3 years. I love her so much. But I feel stuck between her and my older brother \\[34M\\]. They get along great. My brother\u2019s old high school flame \\[34?F\\] came into the picture fairly recently toting a kid. They got in trouble with their landlord for something and were given 6 weeks to move out. They decided to buy a house together.\r  \n\r  \nWell, they both have terrible credit scores and basically no savings. I offered to pay their down payment as my fiance and I both make good money working in finance.

He asked me if I could cosign as our single mom \\[66F\\]\u2019s credit score is also poor. (Two years ago, I cosigned with mom on a small house and have been helping her with living assistance).\r  \n\r  \nI agreed to cosign for my brother and ended up going along with it, telling my fianc\u00e9 about it last night.

Mortgage IF your brother defaults and cannot pay. Thats what co-sign means, is that if the primary borrower cannot pay, then the co-signer is guaranteeing that the payment will be made. And if that happens you (and your wife) will be on the hook for 'such an expensive house'. \n\nIf you had helped him buy a car it would be one thing, but to co-sign on a long term note like a mortgage without discussing it with your wife to be, is an AHole move. Remember once she is married to you, then your debt becomes her debt.", "YTA\n\nYou just locked yourself into your brothers home. I\u2019d be separating from you, I wouldn\u2019t marry you.\n\nYou didn\u2019t think about your own long term, you thought about helping immediately.

Your brother\u2019s financial irresponsibility is not your problem to solve. He has and credit for a reason, and you just made yourself financially responsible for HIS mortgage. If he falls behind on paying, you either have to pay up or tank your own credit. What you\u2019ve done could seriously impact your financial future with your fianc\u00e9.

You may not be able to even buy a house with your fianc\u00e9e now because of this.", "YTA. If I were your fianc\u00e9, I would not go forward with marrying you. You just signed up for your brothers debt on his dream home.

Your fiancee is 100% right about that.

Hopefully you can salvage the trust lost and repair your relationship.", "YTA.\n\nNot saying you have to agree or do as your fianc\u00e9e would like, but you should have at least discussed it.

She is absolutely right to be pissed. Also, cosigning for someone is idiotic and is a bad financial decision. She is 100% correct that your brother needs to deal with the consequences of his own action and live within his means. Family does not mean you pay their way. You understand that as a cosigner credit wise it is considered your debt too. So if your fiance and you wMt to buy a house, your debt to income would include his mortgage. It is highly unlikely that you could financially afford 2 large houses unless you are just really making bank, but given her reaction, I don't think you are. Decisions  like this should absolutely be made together. That's why they call them your partner.", "YTA, you're allowing bro to live outside his means.

I wouldn't be marrying you.", "YTA - this is a huge decision that will impact both of you, and you unilaterally made a decision without discussing it with your fiancee.

Yes, this is going to affect the kind of house you\u2019re going to be able to buy.  It also could put you on the hook for a lot of money.

YTA. You just ruined y'alls future.", "**YTA** \\- And a big-time mistake.  Technically, you are only engaged, so you don't have to ask your fianc\u00e9, but the engagement is sort of a half step between dating and marriage to sort of pretest the relationship.

You could have discussed with your partner the possibility of helping him find a new rental and advising him on his finances for a year or two. But you have just tied yourself to him financially for the next decade(s) and are holding your fianc\u00e9e's finances hostage by extension.", "YTA... \nYou made a massively STUPID decision that WILL affect her future.  \n\nShe would be wise to cancel the engagement as you dont understand the concept of partnership or marriage.", "Yta how fiance is also going to be your family, but you ignored that. It could impact your shared goals to buy a house soon. And heaven forbid your brother doesn't live up to the mortgage, I have my doubts about someone who got into trouble with their landlord. I hope you have now details about what happened there.", "YTA. Time for fiance to change her mind.", "YTA \n\nYou may not be married just yet. But when you do get married, you just made sure that you and your fianc\u00e9 can never own your own house now. Unless your brother default on his payments, in which case you\u2019ll be responsible for all the mortgage payments.\n\nNot to mention, any debt becomes yours. If you guys get married, that is now her debt as well. So your shackling her up with bad financial decisions that she didn\u2019t  even have a say in. \n\nYou\u2019re literally setting you and your fianc\u00e9 up for failure, and the only way she\u2019ll be able to get out of that debt is if she does not marry you, or if she goes through with this marriage (which sorry, I\u2019m hoping she doesn\u2019t. no one wants to be shackle to debt that isn\u2019t theirs) divorce you\n\nRelationships end because of decisions like this. I will be surprised if you even make it to the altar.", "I co-signed for my brothers student loan. It\u2019s a huge pain in my ass now 13 years later. You are a huge asshole here. I wouldn\u2019t legally marry you until this was stopped", "YTA!!!!!!!! \n\nSerious decisions like this need to be discussed and agreed with your fianc\u00e9 before you make them.  \n\nYour brothers crap finances are not yours or you future wife\u2019s problem. Why the fuck should you pay for his down payment, and co-sign on the house?! \n\nHave you not thought of the implications for you and your wife further down the line? \n\nThis is beyond stupid and beyond ridiculous. For me, this would remove any trust I ever had in my partner. I would be leaving. Under no circumstances would my life be dictated by my other half\u2019s brother and his ability or inability to pay his repayments. \n\nWhat happens if he defaults on payments and you have to pay up? What if you and your future wife bought a house, and you could afford the payments for both places? \n\nHave you  actually put any thought into this before you signed?", "Let\u2019s hope for her sake, that she is already gone", "In any finance job, your first question is \"what am I signing for?\".", "Which means he still gets the implications of financial decisions."]}
