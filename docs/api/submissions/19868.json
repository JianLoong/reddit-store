She was away on a holiday with a friend and was arriving home on her birthday so I arranged to take a day off, come home a day early to organise cooking dinner and her cake. Dad goes off to the airport and they both come home and I surprise her with the dinner cake and a present. Dad has done nothing for her birthday, no present, nothing. \n\nWhen mom arrives she\u2019s happy I am there to surprise her, and we sit down and have dinner and wine and hear about her trip away. She even has gifts for us from her holiday. As we are still catching up and having a wine, dad stands up, turns off the dinner jazz playing through the TV and put the game on. Anxiety runs through me and tell him this is not acceptable and to turn it off and come back to the table. He sulks and says \u2018no one cares about what I want it\u2019s all about you\u2019. I\u2019m we continue to sit and chat before dessert (cake) and a few minutes later he leaves the table and does it again removing himself to sit at the couch and put the game on full volume. \n\nThis angered me and I began swearing and asking him how he can treat his wife like this on her birthday,how he had done absolutely nothing for her special day and how he would never watch TV during a celebration with his extended family. He argued back saying that picking her up from the airport (15 minutes away) was enough that that \u2018no one cares about me or what I want, It\u2019s always your way!\u2019*. Mom is so down trodden at this point in the marriage she even began to agree with him saying \u2018he did do something, he picked me up from the airport\u2019. \n\nAITA? Should I have compromised and accepted  him watching the game during a dinner I arranged and flew home for? \n\n*last year for his birthday mom and I arranged a private yacht cruise for the day", "created_utc": 1686958175, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bb8bc/aita_for_having_no_tv_at_dinner/", "score": 338, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If that be the case, I say this as an adult daughter who has (somehow) survived her narcissistic father: he set you up, you played his game, and he won. \n\nHe got the attention he sought and took away all the good vibes you brought your mom. \n\nI feel like I understand your frustration at his behavior, but your reaction may be exactly what he wanted. And I\u2019m guessing you are not interested in giving him what he wants in those moments. \n\nIf this is a sustained issue, I promise you it will not be solved or made better by screaming at him. \n\nMy apologies if I\u2019m way off base on my assessment, but just my two cents.", "ESH. Hear me out though. Your dad is the AH for obvious reasons. The part that, for me, makes you also the AH is that you caused a huge stink during your mom's birthday dinner. You trying to 'parent' your dad was not going to go well and you had to have known that. So instead of just rolling your eyes and focusing on your mom and making her evening as nice as you could, you chose to swear and argue and make a scene. Which I'm sure killed the mood for your mom.", "ESH, except your mom.  Your father was a huge asshole, but your mom\u2019s birthday was not the time to have it out with him.  You should have focused on continuing to have a nice evening with your mom and then talked to him about it later.", "ESH? Like, he's definitely the bigger asshole, but turning it into a big fight really sucked. Time and place, you know? If he's going to be insistent about watching the game or whatever, just compromise with a no/low volume and then after the party deal with it.\n\nAlso, like, it is kinda their house and thus their rules. If he wants to watch his TV, you can't really tell him he's not allowed to even though it is rude of him.", "INFO: what does mom think of this?", "ESH, two narcissists going at it must suck for you mom. It's not about your dad, but it's also not about you, and you failed to see that.", "ESH. Your dad isn't magically going to turn into a different person by screaming at him on your mom's birthday. She knows what she's saddled to at this point.", "ESH. You can\u2019t parent your dad nor can you control their marriage choices. Your dad is being a horrible partner but it\u2019s your moms choice to stay with him. Unfortunately the best choice here would be to ignore him and focus on your mom- you can privately say whatever you want to your dad later on. Sorry he\u2019s the worst.", "One of the easiest ways to spot a narcissist is to observe how they treat someone on their birthday. Dad needed it to be all about him. NTA", "NTA. That's some serious passive aggression on dad's part. Poor mom.", "NTA. Good for you for standing up for your mother against this kind of treatment! If this is how your father treats her on her birthday, I'd hate to see what he does on every other day. There is something wrong with someone who says \"no one cares about what I want\" on his wife's birthday.\n\nI suspect your mother agrees with him just because she has lived with him for so long, she is worn down.", "Dear OP,\n\nYou write so many posts on here and they are always the same. Your writing style never varies, and it's the same story, same crisis, and then same bullshit comments.\n\nAlways with the, \"and then he argued, saying...\" or \"he objected, saying...\" but without the requisite commas needed. Your writing is so predictable and identifiable - and that makes you the asshole in my book.", "Gentle ESH. There's obviously much deeper issues at play, and mom's birthday wasn't the day to dredge them to the surface. If you want to have a deeper conversation about dad's emotional involvement in his marriage or in the family, that's something to be intentional about. Set time aside. Figure out how to discuss it in a way he'll hear you.\n\nAll you've done here is kick up the resentments. You get to leave after, your mom will most likely be dealing with any fallout. Your parents have issues 30 years in the making, it's not going to take something like a brand new \"no tv at dinner\" (while I'm in town) (on birthdays) rule to fix it.", "Your dad's obviously an AH, and you can't seem to control your emotions. ESH. Except mom of course.", "ESH except your mom.\n\nI get it. Your dad is an asshole. There's no question about that. \n\nThe problem is, even though you were doing great with the surprise and the dinner and the cake, ***you*** became an asshole by lashing out at your dad instead of thinking of your mom. Do you really think your mom wanted to hear you point how disrespectful her husband is towards her? On her birthday? \n\nYou and your mom could have continued to have a lovely time together after your dad turned the game on. You could have ignored him and ripped into him the next day in private. I even get wanting your mom to hear how disrespectful he is, but that was not the time to show her that. That was not the time to call him out. That was a time for you to focus on your mom and ignore your dad being an asshole. Your mom likely would have loved just sitting with you.  \n\n\nHaving said that, you should have a conversation with your mom asap (not on her birthday) about your dad and how incredibly rude he is towards her.", "NTA. You did a wonderful thing for your mother, and I\u2019m sure it was the highlight of her birthday. I think you need to come to terms with the fact your parents relationship is no longer, and have zero expectations from your dad. Expectations are premeditated resentments.", "ESH and the way you are acting is incredibly immature. It seems like this is your dads MO - so while this was not the greatest it seems like it is part of a bigger fight. It seems like there is more here.", "YTA. Frankly, if your parents are still your mom knows how your dad is. You picked a fight. You started swearing and yelling. Instead of just ignoring your dad and focusing on your mother.", "YTA.\nMy daughter also thinks she has to \u201chelp\u201d me with her father.

Long story short, it doesn't help, it doesn\u2019t change anything, and your energy is better spent making sure the remnants of growing up with this example isn't carrying over into your own relationships. \nStop policing your dad's behavior. Don't put yourself between them. It's their marriage and the state of it is both their doing.", "mkay.. you clearly do not think YTA, so why ask?, let\u2019s be honest, this is you wanting to show  your flex of shutting down your dad and looking for some \u201catta girl\u201d bs.  Is your dad TA, well of course, the way you have it framed he has to be, going on your word", "YTA i think you shouldn\u2019t have brought it up and made a scene at your mom birthday dinner, maybe you could of talk to your dad privately and told him  he should plan something for your mom in the next few days because she deserve another special moment.", "YTA.   \n\n\nDad was just behaving like dad. That's it, that's all. YOU are not part of their marriage in that way. You did something nice for your mother's birthday, your dad didn't want to sit with two women gabbing away. That's not unusual. Rather than just let your dad go, and you continue with your mother whose day it was. NOT yours, you chose to treat your father like a child, lost your cool, started swearing and put yourself between your parents with NO ONE asking you to do that. And YOU ruined what was a nice treat for your mothers birthday.", "NTA, her clearly neglecting her and she can\u2019t see it or is so use to it that she doesn\u2019t want (or has the strength) to respond.

Yes, Dad might be an AH for doing nothing for his wife's birthday, but this question is about your actions. YTA. It's not your house, not your TV, not your marriage, not your place to take him to task about the above.

He had to be handled with kid gloves most of the time. I've talked to my mom over the years about why she stayed with him and, surprisingly, she had left him a couple of times. But in those times (50's, early 60's) it was more difficult for women to leave and stay gone. So we all learned how to handle dad and when to roll our eyes and move the 'party' to somewhere we didn't run the risk of pissing him off. Was it the best way to handle it? Of course not.
