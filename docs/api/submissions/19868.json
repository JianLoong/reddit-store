She was away on a holiday with a friend and was arriving home on her birthday so I arranged to take a day off, come home a day early to organise cooking dinner and her cake. Dad goes off to the airport and they both come home and I surprise her with the dinner cake and a present. Dad has done nothing for her birthday, no present, nothing. \n\nWhen mom arrives she\u2019s happy I am there to surprise her, and we sit down and have dinner and wine and hear about her trip away. She even has gifts for us from her holiday. As we are still catching up and having a wine, dad stands up, turns off the dinner jazz playing through the TV and put the game on. Anxiety runs through me and tell him this is not acceptable and to turn it off and come back to the table. He sulks and says \u2018no one cares about what I want it\u2019s all about you\u2019. I\u2019m we continue to sit and chat before dessert (cake) and a few minutes later he leaves the table and does it again removing himself to sit at the couch and put the game on full volume. \n\nThis angered me and I began swearing and asking him how he can treat his wife like this on her birthday,how he had done absolutely nothing for her special day and how he would never watch TV during a celebration with his extended family. He argued back saying that picking her up from the airport (15 minutes away) was enough that that \u2018no one cares about me or what I want, It\u2019s always your way!\u2019*. Mom is so down trodden at this point in the marriage she even began to agree with him saying \u2018he did do something, he picked me up from the airport\u2019. \n\nAITA?

Hear me out though. Your dad is the AH for obvious reasons. The part that, for me, makes you also the AH is that you caused a huge stink during your mom's birthday dinner. You trying to 'parent' your dad was not going to go well and you had to have known that. So instead of just rolling your eyes and focusing on your mom and making her evening as nice as you could, you chose to swear and argue and make a scene.

Figure out how to discuss it in a way he'll hear you.\n\nAll you've done here is kick up the resentments. You get to leave after, your mom will most likely be dealing with any fallout.

Do you really think your mom wanted to hear you point how disrespectful her husband is towards her? On her birthday? \n\nYou and your mom could have continued to have a lovely time together after your dad turned the game on. You could have ignored him and ripped into him the next day in private. I even get wanting your mom to hear how disrespectful he is, but that was not the time to show her that. That was not the time to call him out. That was a time for you to focus on your mom and ignore your dad being an asshole.

He had to be handled with kid gloves most of the time. I've talked to my mom over the years about why she stayed with him and, surprisingly, she had left him a couple of times.

Or you and your Mom could have moved to another room to talk and enjoy HER dinner.
