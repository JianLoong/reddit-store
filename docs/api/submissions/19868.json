She was away on a holiday with a friend and was arriving home on her birthday so I arranged to take a day off, come home a day early to organise cooking dinner and her cake. Dad goes off to the airport and they both come home and I surprise her with the dinner cake and a present. Dad has done nothing for her birthday, no present, nothing. \n\nWhen mom arrives she\u2019s happy I am there to surprise her, and we sit down and have dinner and wine and hear about her trip away. She even has gifts for us from her holiday. As we are still catching up and having a wine, dad stands up, turns off the dinner jazz playing through the TV and put the game on. Anxiety runs through me and tell him this is not acceptable and to turn it off and come back to the table. He sulks and says \u2018no one cares about what I want it\u2019s all about you\u2019. I\u2019m we continue to sit and chat before dessert (cake) and a few minutes later he leaves the table and does it again removing himself to sit at the couch and put the game on full volume. \n\nThis angered me and I began swearing and asking him how he can treat his wife like this on her birthday,how he had done absolutely nothing for her special day and how he would never watch TV during a celebration with his extended family. He argued back saying that picking her up from the airport (15 minutes away) was enough that that \u2018no one cares about me or what I want, It\u2019s always your way!\u2019*. Mom is so down trodden at this point in the marriage she even began to agree with him saying \u2018he did do something, he picked me up from the airport\u2019. \n\nAITA?

Hear me out though. Your dad is the AH for obvious reasons. The part that, for me, makes you also the AH is that you caused a huge stink during your mom's birthday dinner. You trying to 'parent' your dad was not going to go well and you had to have known that. So instead of just rolling your eyes and focusing on your mom and making her evening as nice as you could, you chose to swear and argue and make a scene.

On her birthday? \n\nYou and your mom could have continued to have a lovely time together after your dad turned the game on. You could have ignored him and ripped into him the next day in private. I even get wanting your mom to hear how disrespectful he is, but that was not the time to show her that. That was not the time to call him out. That was a time for you to focus on your mom and ignore your dad being an asshole.

He had to be handled with kid gloves most of the time. I've talked to my mom over the years about why she stayed with him and, surprisingly, she had left him a couple of times.

I wouldn't ever come here for advice because the judgments are fucking unhinged and everyone is very very stupid and wrong", "You are so much the YTA.\n\nIts not your home so has nothing to do with you.\n\nYour parents are adults and as adults they happily have a bithday in a way they want.\n\nIts not down to your childish attitude to expect everyone elset o do things in the same way as you want.\n\nYour assumption that your mother is down trodden because she is content with how the choose to live their  lives.\n\nSo i would say YTA at least 4 times over.", "Definitely you. Dinner jazz lol. Let people do what they wanna do and even though they're your parents you need to back off out of people's relationships, everyone shows love in different ways", "ESH. Your dad is obvious. But you're in his house. Don't tell him what to do. Take your mom and only your mom out to dinner next time. It's not your place to fix their marriage.", "ESH. Idk but you maybe could have said in a more nice way mindful of your moms feelings and you also could have ignored the tv and just talked or moved, but your dad is an ass but your an ass as well for trying to \u2018parent\u2019 don\u2019t do it, I went down their once and let\u2019s say it wasn\u2019t good", "My dad was like this, present but never emotionally there, I completely get where you are coming from OP, in my mind you nta", "ESH even the mom for being a doormat.   And jazz sucks too.", "Your dad was definitely being a jerk but I agree that while you can ask him not to watch TV and to hang out and stay at the table, yelling at him isn\u2019t the best way forward. If anything I would have pulled him aside or talked to him the next day. Clearly something is up if he feels this behavior is ok. Since you\u2019re so upset about this it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s a regular occurrence so maybe things are great between them right now.", "YTA. First of all like others have said, it's their house, their rules. So you arguing about it is very inappropriate. Also you sound to me like a narcissistic teenager. Obviously you don't care about what your mom wants or else you would've asked or checked before making a scene. Also sounds like you make many assumptions about their marriage you simply know nothing about. Stop that. It's also highly inappropriate. Do you even know if anything happened? Did your dad plan something in secret for your mom that's to private to share with you? Did they have a fight not long ago where your mom clearly was in the wrong? Do they have some kind of serious agreement that they won't do much for each others birthday? You simply don't know but decide to make it all your responsibility nonetheless. It's also honestly pretty cringe.", "ESH BUT THERE'S LACKING INFO\nI've read a lot of stories and AHs like your dad who receives birthday yacht surprises don't just stop reciprocating family efforts overnight. There's a missing part in the story that made your dad like this (and I can only bet) it's because your mom was or is an AH too (at least with their relationship). \n\nAlso, I agree with top commenters that u should have talked to ur dad in private. It would help u find out the missing information (unless u know what made ur dad this way so you really are just making him sound much worse)", "YTA, parenting your parents rarely works out the way you hope. Your mom is clearly conflict averse and for her birthday you gave her a fight. I get your intentions may have been good but you were actually really selfish in how you carried them out. \n\nShe's an adult, not a child being bullied on the playground. She doesn't stand up for herself for a reason and, as much as it sucks to watch, your efforts were very clearly unwelcome.", "YTA. Narcissists complaining about narcissists has to the funniest of all AITA threads on here. It was Mums birthday, and it should have been about her. You made it about you, and played Dads (also the AH) game of it also being about him. Mum (NTA) is sadly the victim. If I\u2019m way off mark, and you aren\u2019t the narcissistic product of a narcissist father, next time take Mum away for her birthday. Quietly. No need to broadcast the myriad ways you make yourself feel good, using Mum as a prop. Just be a loving, caring daughter.", "NTA\n\nIt really seems like he\u2019s the child here -a very bratty teenager child! It\u2019s common curiosity to have conversations rather than tv at the dinner table, especially when it\u2019s a celebration and people have travels. \n\nHonestly your dad sounds awful, your poor mother.", "Esh.  It isn't your house or rules for dinner but I also agree the dinner should've been without tv for everyone to catch up", "YTA what stands out to me is when he first did it you say you felt 'anxiety'? Why, why are you anxious? Don't parent another adult in their own home. You created a scene because of why? Your need for control?", "YTA. You surprise your folks by showing up at their house unannounced, then start telling them what\u2019s \u201cacceptable\u201d for them to do in their own house, causing a big scene for your mom\u2019s birthday.", "ESH. You turned your moms birthday into hashing it out with your dad.", "NTA. Picking your spouse up from the airport is your job as a spouse. It's literally the bare minimum. When it's his birthday yall shouldn't do anything.", "No! NTA! You shoulda thrown a box of tissues at him and said \u201cwant some cheese with that self absorbed whine?\u201d  Your mom deserves so much better! Good for you!", "NTA \nBut he is heavy loaded on the relationship. They need therapy.\nYou can do HIM a special day too. You will care of what he want.", "Your mom needs to leave him but she never will.  She's been broken by him and it will be the death of her.  It's hard to watch.\n\nI agree that the better thing to have done is to leave with your mom and go out to finish her birthday celebration.  The tv was probably so loud that he would've have heard the door open and close behind you.  But I would be worried he'd take it out on your mom later.\n\nDoes she realise she's living with domestic violence?", "ESH\u2014Sounds like the apple doesn\u2019t fall too far from the tree\u2026", "I dunno I was thinking he\u2019s the asshole until you said he turned off the dinner jazz while you were drinking wine. \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m sorry I think maybe you like dinner jazz and wine and he likes to watch the game -  I dunno your post gives off a slight air of superiority. He may be the asshole in general but in this instance YTA\u2026he stated he chatted he listened he ate he did cake and then I guess he was done with the dinner jazz and tried to drown it out", "Yup. She took his bait, he got his fight.", ">Which I'm sure killed the mood for your mom.\n\nAnd probably got her in trouble after OP left, on top of it. Happy Birthday!", "Was prob not the first time Dad was an ass.\nMoms birthday, just got home from a trip - let\u2019s feel sad for Dad , he\u2019s been alone. \nNTA", "Yeah Dad's behavior might not be treating Mom the best, but OP is an asshole for getting in the middle and trying to referee their marriage", "How the fuck is this the top comment", "ESH?", "What gave her that impression though? That doesn't magically happen out of nowhere.", "Consider that your unhealthy marriage dynamic has created a situation where your daughter feels the need to be on the defensive with her father. Her behavior is likely a consequence of a lifetime of having to deal with it unfolding in front of her and modeling unhealthy emotional regulation, etc. Her parents\u2014you as well, being part of that dynamic\u2014created this situation. And it\u2019s very sad that you put this on your daughter without realizing your own role in it.", "I think it\u2019s pretty rude that he\u2019d turn off the dinner music during his wife\u2019s birthday dinner, and put on a game without asking. But maybe he hated the music. \n\nI\u2019ve been around a lot of parents who raise their children to ask to be excused from the dinner table, which I always thought was a bit controlling for restless kids who might be made to sit at the table until everyone was finished. But some people think this is just good manners. It\u2019s possible the OP was raised in that way, but even if she wasn\u2019t, why wouldn\u2019t he say, \u201chey, do you mind if I put the game on!", "It gives me Midwest girl gets high flying job in New York and goes home to show off vibes", "Enablers, that's exactly what it is. These responses are so vile. I interfered with a woman getting assaulted once and afterwards a few of my coward friends said I should have ignored it.

He doesn't need to be there.", "Everyone Sucks Here\n\nAlthough in this case just OP and their Dad, since no-one thinks the Mom sucks.", "You complain about the sound of the TV, but was dinner more engaging and gratifying for your mother with the sounds of your argument? I'd take inconsiderate TV sounds over argument any day, especially because you were lucky enough to leave when you were done setting that fire - your mother is the one who had to deal with his sad sack act.", "I'm sure her mother didn't appreciate it, but I'm pretty sure mom didn't appreciate an argument ending the night either.", "I think the dinner jazz was destroying the celebration IMO", "Definitely. This whole scenario sounds so ridiculous like her dad just wants to watch sport and his daughter is screaming at him saying he must like sit at the table and listen to dinner jazz while she talks to her mom about her trip?\n\nNot everyone has to be as interested in stuff like that as you are. How does she know that her dad didn't already hear as much as he wanted to about her mom's trip in the car ride from the airport?\n\nI'm also not one of those people who needs to know every small detail about someone's trip", "The guy who cries about someone else\u2019s birthday being all about them and can\u2019t even sit through cake with his immediate family, including his daughter who flew in for this.", "Also, I agree with top commenters that u should have talked to ur dad in private.", "She wouldn't even admit that picking her up from the airport didn't count as birthday plans. You think telling her to divorce is going to result in anything except harming OP's relationship with his mother?", "She\u2019s probably having a hard time after being together for so many years", "Don't let these dumbasses get to you. You're wasting your time. They will believe basically anything", "it\u2019s more about leaving the dad pissy for the mom to deal with rather than excusing the behavior.

Kidnap OP's mother? It sounds to me like you've never actually known anyone in an abusive relationship. It's not so easy - you can't \"make\" someone leave someone who's bad to them, (and believe me, I wish we could).", "Loveless isn't the same thing as abusive. Divorce has its own set of legal and emotional tolls on an individual, especially elderly people. It's not OP's place to regulate their marriage, if mom is content with a roommate type partnership, it's healthy.", "Yeah, exactly this. All OP did was start shit for his mother to finish when he left. I'm all for calling out shitty behavior - this just wasn't the time or place."]}
