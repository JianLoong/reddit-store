She was away on a holiday with a friend and was arriving home on her birthday so I arranged to take a day off, come home a day early to organise cooking dinner and her cake. Dad goes off to the airport and they both come home and I surprise her with the dinner cake and a present. Dad has done nothing for her birthday, no present, nothing. \n\nWhen mom arrives she\u2019s happy I am there to surprise her, and we sit down and have dinner and wine and hear about her trip away. She even has gifts for us from her holiday. As we are still catching up and having a wine, dad stands up, turns off the dinner jazz playing through the TV and put the game on. Anxiety runs through me and tell him this is not acceptable and to turn it off and come back to the table. He sulks and says \u2018no one cares about what I want it\u2019s all about you\u2019. I\u2019m we continue to sit and chat before dessert (cake) and a few minutes later he leaves the table and does it again removing himself to sit at the couch and put the game on full volume. \n\nThis angered me and I began swearing and asking him how he can treat his wife like this on her birthday,how he had done absolutely nothing for her special day and how he would never watch TV during a celebration with his extended family. He argued back saying that picking her up from the airport (15 minutes away) was enough that that \u2018no one cares about me or what I want, It\u2019s always your way!\u2019*. Mom is so down trodden at this point in the marriage she even began to agree with him saying \u2018he did do something, he picked me up from the airport\u2019. \n\nAITA?

So instead of just rolling your eyes and focusing on your mom and making her evening as nice as you could, you chose to swear and argue and make a scene.

On her birthday? \n\nYou and your mom could have continued to have a lovely time together after your dad turned the game on. You could have ignored him and ripped into him the next day in private. I even get wanting your mom to hear how disrespectful he is, but that was not the time to show her that. That was not the time to call him out. That was a time for you to focus on your mom and ignore your dad being an asshole.

He had to be handled with kid gloves most of the time. I've talked to my mom over the years about why she stayed with him and, surprisingly, she had left him a couple of times.

You can leave at any time.", "[deleted]", "I\u2019d probably read the other responses to your comment in addition to mine- maybe you need to take a look at your marriage and be thankful your daughter actually cares enough to try to help, because eventually, she\u2019ll just stop trying, and you might realize what you didn\u2019t appreciate. \n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, it sounds like you have a problem husband, you make excuses for him, and throw your daughter under the bus in the process.", "Totally agree. As a wife and mother, I was in this kind of relationship for years until I walked. My daughter's came with me. Until the mum has the courage or wants to end the marriage all the OP can do is support her. I was also at fault for pandering to my ex's every need. My daughters' were always telling me to leave him. Sadly many marriages are like this. They are grown women now but still have resentment towards my ex. Thing is everyone is affected by these relationships. It's how you choose to deal with it.", "Lol I\u2019m not rlly in the NTA category but the \u201ctwo women gabbing away\u201d are his wife and daughter?????? Idk I think most ppl would want to engage with their spouse and adult children, and hear what\u2019s going on w them", "Uh yeah, AHs like her dad do receive yacht birthdays and don\u2019t reciprocate shit and act like assholes for no reason. I\u2019ve seen it many times. I see you aren\u2019t familiar with this type of situation.", "Your \u201cnot what I\u2019d want in my relationship\u201d type of relationship (to put it nicely) doesn\u2019t excuse shitty relationships. But you do!", "Nah, your own house or not if an immediate family member is behaving like an inconsiderate asshole towards another family member they deserve to be called out, albeit in a more tactful way that OP did. Just because it's your house doesn't mean you're exempt from having your bad behaviour pointed out.", "r/iamverybadass", "It\u2019s NOT your house!! You don\u2019t get to dictate here. How are you not getting that?", "Just ask him to turn it down and move in.  Is this something you do a lot in trying to tell people how to live their lives?   You might be right but now everyone needs to hear how you see things or your opinion.  Time to grow up and keep that shit to yourself.", "What an awful take. While I disagree with what OP did as it likely caused more harm than good, she literally flew from another state to surprise her mum and make a fuss of her, and was trying to (misguidedly) defend her from a situation that would piss of any loving child. The standard you've set for the husband Vs the daughter is night and day, which I find interesting.", "Father doesn't seem like to type to take much notice of social cues. Daughter does.\n\nFather doesn't seem to care about anybody's feelings but his own. Daughter does seem to care.\n\nRead up any literature on personality disorders and how they can transfer from parent to child.\n\nDaughter seems very different to Father. And if we are to be throwing personality disorder diagnosis around and agreeing with those that do so blindly. I feel that anybody intelligent enough to not emotionally charge the situation from their own place of projection, and who has some real world experience with personality disorders, and behaviour. This situation is more indicative of a Narcissistic Father, Anxious Mother, Borderline Daughter.\n\nHowever, this is by using the same fallacious logical framework used to diagnose in the first place.\n\nI doubt anybody in this situation has a personality disorder. The only ones showing indications of such diagnosis are the people blindly diagnosing others in the comments.", "you have to be 12. you're diagnosing OP as a narc? utter clown shit", "A Lifetime classic!", "That's a lot of words to say \"I have low social and emotional intelligence\"", "I'd say NTA for this reason. Dad should hear that it's not okay. I can't say I would have reacted any differently, though sure, it would be nice if it didn't involve yelling.", "Call him out tactfully after the birthday.", "[removed]", "Yes, how are they to listen to their Dinner Jazz if there\u2019s a football game on? Dinner jazz is very important to the ambience of this extremely awkward dinner", "Sounds like the mother has two controlling people in her life\u2026", "Paying a mortgage doesn't give you licence to behave as shittily as you want with no objections. If your own family can't tell you honestly that you're acting like an arse, no one can.", "As someone with the same parental situation, this is a hard lesson, but it's true. Your mum is an adult, in fact, with decades longer life experience than you - she can choose how to conduct her relationships. You don't need to reparent either of them, but you can continue to support your mum. But most of all, protect you and your peace.\n\nNTA.", "Maybe her mom actually appreciated the fact that she stood up for her, even if she couldn\u2019t stand up for herself. Should everyone just kowtow to the asshole?", "Exactly. Imagine diagnosing somebody with a personality disorder like that, based off a Reddit post \ud83d\ude02\n\nThe only person that does this and engages in such behaviour, is projecting. Every time.", "OP turned up unannounced to the family home, made demands in a home that is not hers, started a verbal fight with expletives during her mother\u2019s birthday, acted judgemental, took away her mother\u2019s agency, and then tried to take the moral high ground. The only non-asshole here is the poor mother who had to put up with the two people she loves most in this world at each other\u2019s throats.", "Ooh look at you projecting. First off, I said that daughter shows traits of being like her father. Wasn\u2019t \u201cdiagnosing\u201d anyone. Neither takes into account what mother wants, only what they believe she wants. If daughter picked up on social cues, she would have seen that her behaviour was making her mother uncomfortable in her own home. But she didn\u2019t. She had to be right and teach her father a lesson.", "Oh hi Lauren, you\u2019re still here? I thought you said all of use commenters were just idiots and you hated the lot of us. Don\u2019t let the door hit you on the way out, hmm? Otherwise that would make you a raging hypocrite, no?", "Learning that that\u2019s a thing ruined my dinner", "I'm seeing a lot of comments in the vein of 'you can't tell him what to do in his own house' and 'calling him out will make things worse.' While I agree that OP could have handled things in a way that would have hurt her mum less- taking her dad aside, for example, this 'don't rock the boat' spread all throughout the comments is literally how people get away with mistreating their spouses for an entire marriage, and more specifically how this 1950s husband attitude still persists today.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Daughter overstepped massively.", "I get that, but there is a time and a place. When you are under someone else\u2019s roof, you are a guest and abide by their rules and common decency. Daughter could have chosen a different day, time and place to have this out with her father but she didn\u2019t. Made her automatically lose the moral high ground.", "Yes, because when I'm glad that someone standing up for me, I make a bunch of excuses for the person emotionally abusing me.", "Weird lack of self awareness in this comment", "Plenty of people are welcome to turn up to their family home whenever, and plenty of parents would be delighted by that kind of surprise- OP clearly has a key and is familiar enough with the house to make a cake and cook dinner there. It's also not judgemental if the behaviour is objectively shitty. Standing up for someone is not 'taking away their agency'- though I do disagree with OP's methods and turning the nice dinner into an ugly fight.", "I was thinking like is this even an issue or was OP just causing drama? OP is 32 so her parents must be like 50 or above. Was the TV even a problem to mom? They seem plenty old enough to be comfortable with how things are.", "[removed]", "I didn't say you were diagnosing. You agreed with the comment diagnosing.\n\nEverything you've described is a fair analysis. I didn't say I agreed with Daughters approach. Just that it's bold af for ppl to be diagnosing PD's via a Reddit post.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure you understand how projection works. What part of my comment to you was me projecting?", "Yeah, just like saying \"none of my business what goes on behind closed doors\"\ud83e\udd14 \nI only hear it in movies/TV but its always a situation where people should definitely *not* mind their own business.", "Using your mum\u2019s birthday to become an activist against your dad is just shit though.\n\nOP didn\u2019t treat her to a nice birthday meal, they treated her to a fight with her husband. The two of them could have still had a nice night, paying no attention to dad sulking in front of the telly, but the fight took priority.\n\nThat just sounds like a dysfunctional family. Dad\u2019s an AH, OP\u2019s an AH, and mum is caught in the middle trying to de-escalate on her birthday surprise.", "That\u2019s actually what abused people do.", "How so? What about my comment made you conclude it lacks self awareness?", "You sound delightful. Violence is never the answer. Combatting abuse with abusive behaviour is just as bad. Makes you no better than the abuser.", "I mean the irony is, OP's dad probably saw this behaviour modelled in his own upbringing. Letting this behaviour slide is literally how generational cycles of abuse/toxicity are perpetuated", "OP is a woman.", "So winding up the perpetrator of the abuse and then leaving the situation is the right call? Because abusers never lash out right?", "Exactly.

Is from a place of projection. Obviously.\n\nI never once said making \"strong sweeping judgements\" was something we shouldn't do, or is inherently wrong to do. Sometimes it's accurate, other times it's not.\n\nMy strong sweeping judgement was accurate. Theirs wasn't.\n\nConclusion: Don't try to diagnose mental illness in others over Reddit. It is a stupendously insecure and emotionally charged way to behave.\n\nI'd hope you are simply offering me the context behind the original comment. Because your breakdown is a fine example of strawman logic.\n\nWhat I did, was not the same as what I was calling out. Clearly."]}
