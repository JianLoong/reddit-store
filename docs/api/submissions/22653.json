Only my two very close collegue friends knew the reality.

It lasted as is for a year-ish until I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and tried to leave the situationship. She then became very toxic as she said I hurted her a lot by trying to leave, that I had issues for thinking anything could happen between us or that I was the one that broke what we had. She also came back several times saying she wanted to keep being friends and saying all was my fault when the situation wasn\u2019t like before, even when I told her several time to stop contacting me to heal. I also learned after that she was sleeping with an intern while we were \u00ab\u00a0a thing together\u00a0\u00bb.

Cruel ending yes but can you clarify what was done during the relationship that made you say abusive?", "YTA for painting her as \"abusive\" when she quite clearly wasn't. She hurt your feelings when she didn't want to escalate your \"situationship\" and that stinks (ProTip, the fact that you refer to it as a \"situationship\" means you KNEW the parameters weren't \"dating,\" and I'm going to give her a pass for sleeping with someone else, although it was a garbage move not to tell you).\n\nThe box of toys on the desk wasn't cool, either,  but I'm gonna use my context clues (especially the fact that you've done everything you possibly can to paint yourself as the Saint and her as the Devil) to extrapolate that was likely a last resort, and you probably left her no other choice. \n\nBreakups are tricky, especially when you choose to shit where you eat. Don't hook up with co-workers. It rarely ends well.\n\nBut yeah,  YTA for thinking your friends should pick sides, and specifically pick YOURS. She hurt your feelings,  and I'm sorry for that.  But you haven't conducted yourself particularly well, either. Learn from it, grow from it, and if you REALLY can't cope, get yourself some therapy and a new friend group", "INFO : What exactly was the \u201cabuse\u201d? All I see is a dying relationship that was toxic on both sides.", "YTA if you're trying to control who your friends are friends with. You have a problem with Sarah. Do they? \n\nThey say to not shit where you eat (as in don't date coworkers) because shit like this can happen if you break up. This is the reason why.", "YTA. It sounds like you just aren't dealing with the break up very well", "YTA. It may have been a messy breakup but nothing you\u2019ve described sounds like abuse, and expecting mutual friends to take sides after a normal breakup is pretty toxic TBH. I\u2019d have sided with the less dramatic friend who isn\u2019t trying to play the victim to isolate their ex too.", "Unless you\u2019re hiding something from the post, she wasn\u2019t abusive and YTA a bit. It wasn\u2019t ever made a serious official relationship, and even if it was nothing you described is abusive. It\u2019s just an average shitty relationship. It sucks your friends are staying close to her if you can\u2019t be around her, but they have a right to be friends with anyone and it doesn\u2019t sound like she is a Bad Person or was just a bad situation. That\u2019s not enough reason for a lot of people to just drop someone, it happens to people all the time", "Sorry, but your friends are correct. \"(Your) affairs with her weren't their business\". Gentle YTA. Maybe find a better therapist. Or new friends.", "YTA, but only a little but. The toys in the office thing was a shit action. But she did not abuse you. You had shitty relationship you chose to call \"situationship\" wherever that word came from.\n\nHer reaction also was not... normal. But still not abuse.\n\nYour friends don't owe you loyalty here. If Sarah did not put them on the spot you shouldn't either. \n\nYou had the same friendgroup and chose to block her out. What did you expect? There is a reason people tend to NOT date inside a friendgroup.", "Soft YTA", "first you walked away from the group to decompress or whatever but that just gave her an opportunity to get closer to the group. they feel closer now and are sticking with her, they are trying to accommodate by not including you if shes there, you made the choice for them by walking away. they wont cut the person off who stayed. you may be not realizing that those who were closer to you before arent now and its time to find other friends.", "I would cut all ties.", "Probably unpopular, but NAH. \n\nThis is the tricking situation where there are relationships in the friend group.  \n\nHere is what I will say, having been the friend here.   There are 2 sides to the story.   There is also what they witnessed.  Many things are possible.  Based on all the information they have, its possible that they don't see the situation as bad as you do.  Its also possible that they don't want to take sides.   None of that makes YOU feel better, but again, I get it. \n\nThis happened once in my friend group.  A relationship was toxic.  They both accused each other of pretty horrible stuff.  What was done in front of everyone was shitty on both ends.  The majority of us tried to not take sides in the breakup.  Because who knows what happened behind closed doors.  But some people did take sides.  And lets just say that it caused A LOT of issues among our friends.  Hell, me and my best friend had issues because his wife (and therefore him by extension) chose the girls side, while I chose to be somewhat neutral.  \n\nSo again, none of this will make you feel better, but I think its much bigger than just you at this point, and people are trying to maintain their circle.", "NTA, and I would advise leaving that friend group. I had to drop some so-called friends who continued to associate with my abusive ex. They knew he was abusing me and even named his behavior as abuse but continued talking to him because he was just such a fun guy or whatever.  Sorry, but nope. I respect myself too much to associate with people who can look the other way at abuse they are aware of.", "Well I have been going back and forth going through the comments but I agree with NAH at least from the information I see. It seems like whether or not you were in a relationship is muddy and also the toxic ending is muddy I believe in the sense that you were going at it from a standpoint of a relationship ending, while the other side might argue they didn\u2019t. Maybe it did mean more to her than she could admit herself or maybe she is an AH, don\u2019t know. But I think it is not clear cut enough for your friends to say, yeah no, not going to spend another second with her. But I do disagree that you are the asshole as I believe your feelings of hurt are also valid and it might be more to you than it seems to them. Have you told your friends about this? Not in an accusation but in some form of healing conversation? Maybe they know the details but not how much it meant to uou or how much it hurt? \nI think communication and not dying on that hill that they have to block her but making sure they understand all of your story and trying to understand where they are clming from (not saying you are not doing that).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But it was after when I tried to leave, there it was full toxic with bullying, gaslighting, and saying everything was my fault. And then ending by putting the toys on my desk.", "I\u2019d like to do that, but I have already distanced myself because of the situation, then came back when I could handle seeing her name, pics and discussions again. I feel like I would bother them again with my issues if I bring the subject again. So I speak about it with my therapist and do not react when they tell me what a good time they had with her when I wasn\u2019t invited. But the therapist only help me handle my emotional reactions, he does not tell me if I am in the wrong, the asshole or in the right. And my friends who are out of the friend group all side with me regardless of the situation as they do not know Sarah. So looking for an untwisted feedback here", "You are saying bullying and gaslighting but that\u2019s rather vague. Sounds like you expected more .. in terms of being led on .. were you lied to and told you were in a relationship and then cheated on? Sex in and of itself is not leading someone on and maybe she didn\u2019t feel that sleeping with other people was your business at the time because you weren\u2019t committed .. just saying you\u2019re hurt but sounds like friends want to stay out of it. She might be a player or an AH and you got very hurt\u2026 I hope you can move on. As for the sex toys on the desk\u2026 she tried to humiliate you at work.. foreable offense and not real smart", "I still don't know that what you are describing is abuse.  \n\nYou are using vague terms here that frankly have lost all meaning, especially on reddit.  Bullying and gaslighting get thrown around so much that without actual examples, it just sounds like words.", "That\u2019s a very good point. And I def was hurt very much. About being led on, it s tricky as I had told her several times that I wanted a clear answer on what she felt. Either being committed or stopping things/keeping things casual. She always refused to answer and told me she didn\u2019t know what she felt. But that maybe one day she would go out with me, or that if she had to live with someone it would be me, or that I was the only one that mattered a bit. I trusted her which is why I stayed this long, and after the break up I learned she was banging an intern while saying that.", "If she refused to answer you, then she did NOT lead you on. You sound like you think you were entitled to be in a relationship with her. But you are not. Other than the desk incident, nothing else sounds like any sort of abuse. But YTA. Not answering you IS an answer. You just need to accept it.", "I don't see any bullying or gaslighting here. Just because she lied to you doesn't mean it was gaslighting or abuse. Cheating isn't bullying or abuse.\n\nStop using that word to describe someone being a shitty romantic partner.\n\nNeither of you sound great in a relationships but that doesn't mean your friends have to stop being friends with her. They're not going to pick you over her so make of that as you will."]}
