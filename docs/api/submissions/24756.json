He's going to have a 6 year old stepdaughter (Luna) when he gets married. And this whole post is about my dad and his fianc\u00e9e thinking my maternal grandparents should give his stepdaughter a gift to wear to the wedding. My mom died 4 years ago and dad and her were still married and he still has some contact with her family. But since I moved out last year it has been less than when I lived there. I'm 19f btw.\n\nSo what happened is my grandparents bought me this really sweet locket for my birthday. My dad and his fianc\u00e9e were living together at the time and they brought me out to dinner to celebrate. Luna was also there and heard her mom ask about my locket and who bought it for me. Luna was suddenly all excited and talking about how they're about to be her grandparents too and would they buy her one. My dad said they probably would and we'd ask them, meaning he and I would. I looked at him like he was crazy but he ignored me.\n\nHe did, in fact, ask my grandparents later and they said no. They even asked him why they would buy her something. They have no relationship to her and will likely only see her on very rare occasions. He was pissy at them for their response but I was like, uh yeah, that makes sense to me.\n\nSo my grandparents helped me and my friends move into an apartment together over the summer. They also helped us get set up with some stuff. This bothered my dad's fianc\u00e9e a lot because they are yet to meet her or Luna and made no effort to do anything for Luna's birthday.\n\nSo she and my dad told them they would be invited to the wedding, which they must accept, and they must give Luna something sweet before the wedding as a symbol of her being adopted as a grandchild by them. Now again, these are my mom's parents, not my dad's. My grandparents told them it would not be happening.\n\nFast forward on and my dad and his fianc\u00e9e have complained about it constantly. My grandparents gave me a heads up that drama was going down over their refusal. My dad and his fianc\u00e9e said I should talk to my grandparents and tell them to knock it off and to treat my sister better than they are. I told them they shouldn't be such greedy assholes and that I am not going to ask my grandparents that. I told them Luna isn't my sister and even if she was, it would not obligate my grandparents to do anything for her unless they were my dad's parents.\n\nWe got into an argument over me calling them greedy assholes. They were offended and told me I was a dick to say that about Luna too.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692172673, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15sjaur/aita_for_telling_my_dad_and_his_fianc\u00e9e_that/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You dad and his fianc\u00e9e are insane , in what world do they think ur grandparents owe Luna anything or are anything to Luna . They are greedy .\nYes you are also correct . This girl is not ur sister , dad is not married yet , you are an adult and won\u2019t live under their roof", "NTA. Your grandparents have a right to decide how they want to establish a relationship with Luna. It's not fair for anyone to impose their expectations on them.", "Yea NTA they're not her grandparents I don't know why your father doesn't get that", "NTA. Your dad and his fianc\u00e9e should just buy Luna a locket themselves if they want her to have one so badly. Your maternal grandparents owe her absolutely nothing and it's bizarre (and, yes, greedy) your dad is acting like they do. Seriously, she's six, it doesn't have to be a super expensive one.\n\nHeck, your dad should get her one as a statement / commitment of him being her new stepdad. Her mom gets a ring, and she gets a locket. Perfect kid logic.", "NTA I don't think you're being an asshole at all in this situation. You're right to point out that relationships can't be forced, and it's important to respect your grandparents' boundaries and decisions.", "NTA.\n\nThey are not obligated to attend the wedding of their late daughters husband. They damn sure don't owe his soon to be stepdaughter or his fiance anything.", "Nta \nThat's weird they have no family ties to ur dad", "NTA. Yeah that's pretty greedy and a whole lot deluded in their entitlement.", "NTA- why would your mothers parents want to see their widowed son in law get remarried", "Jesus! What is wrong with these people?!? Luna is nothing to them. They are your grandparents not hers. I presume Luna\u2019s mother has parents that would be perfectly capable of buying their granddaughter a gift. Definitely NTA. Your grandparents sound like lovely people who are looking after their own granddaughter", "NTA.\n\nYour dad is trying to keep up the facade of a relationship that doesn't really exist anymore, all in the name of greed.\n\nThe fact that he still won't back off even after you and your grandparents have called him out on it is utterly ridiculous. At least you know they'll have your back when you go low / no contact.\n\nEdit: INFO - do you grandparents have any other children?\n\nIf not your dad and his fiancee are probably angling to be included in their will as 'family' since presumably you'd be the main beneficiary.", "Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with people?? How the fuck they expect their dead/divorced ex wife's parents to be grandparents to their new kids?? Why would the ex in laws give a rat's ass about the ex in law's new kids??", "NTA. Your grandparents have lost their daughter and your dad seems to be trying to shoehorn his new fianc\u00e9e in her place. They have no obligations to this woman or her daughter.", "NTA . Don\u2019t wear your locket around your dad or his new family. I feel they might take it. I also hope they don\u2019t have access to your new home. \nMay I ask if Luna has grandparents on her mom\u2019s, bio dad, or your dad\u2019s side? Or maybe not as well off as your maternal grandparents? Not defending your dad or his fianc\u00e9e at all, and they\u2019re raising Luna to be entitled. But just wondering", "NTA for thinking it or for explaining why they shouldn\u2019t expect anything from your grandparents but a very little YTA for saying it like that. Insults never help in any discussion, you will realize that with time.\nAnyway, good luck with that.", "ESH. Your dad and fiance suck for pushing this so much, when if they wanted they could just get Luna a locket. Your grandparents suck less, but its still a bit rude. I come from a blended family, and all the grandparents are our grandparents, no one cares about who is blood related to whom. You suck a tiny bit for not accepting Luna as a part of the family. Luna doesn't suck at all, and I hope someone buys her a cute locket.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A simple convo of, these are OP's grandparents on her mother's side. Like your mommy already has parents, etc. IDK what exactly they should have said, but they should not have set her up an expectation that OP's grands would automatically be hers. \n\nYour perfect princess can't have everything, OP's Dad. What an awful way to parent. The whole wedding invite with a gift and adoption requirement is beyond the pale. \n\nNTA, OP. Carry on with your adulting, even if the adults in your life can't seem to manage it.", "&#x200B;\n\nNTA.\n\n1. Your grandparents should not go to the wedding of your dad - its rubbing it in their faces that their daughter is dead and that he has moved on and is playing happy families with another woman when this should have been your mothers life. And if they did want to go because they are kind - they are not that 6 year olds grandparents, nor her step grandparents - she is no one. \n2. They don't need to stay in touch with him now he has moved on and has another family unless its about you. \n3. The 6 year old has two sets of grandparents from her mother and father and even if the father is out of the picture or any grandparents are dead - she now has your dads family - but now they want to collect a fourth family from his deceased wife's side?  And even if there was no family due to deaths - she has her mother and step father and that's all you need.\n4. Luna isn't your sister, you are an adult and out of the home and she is merely the daughter of the woman your dad has married. Their greedy behavior has made it that you don't even want a relationship with the kid or the mother. Its absolutely insane their level of entitlement and the HURT they are now causing your grandparents.\n5. Tell them if they repeat one more bad thing about your grandparents or insist one more time then you will not go to the wedding, that you will publicly tell the entire family on your dad and mothers side and family friends their insane demands and that you will even be forced to go no contact.", "NTA but your grandparents need to block your dad. You are an adult now, they don't need to talk to him anymore", "NTA. They are your grandparents and the reason they keep in contact with your Dad is because your late mother and they probably became very close due to that. But they don't know Luna and she isn't related to them. Would be different if they were invited as friends to Luna's birthday party or something as they are connected via your Dad, but this is a wedding and Luna probably has grandparents from her Mom's side and Dad's side and now also from the Stepdad's side?", "NTA..  your dad and girlfriend are off their heads.  Luna has no family tie to your mums grandparents so unless the gps want to have a relationship then it stays as the step daughter of their ex son in law (once he remarries) so even that link would die off .. they will be and only be wonderful kind loving grandparents to you x", "\"This bothered my dad's fianc\u00e9e a lot because they are yet to meet her or Luna\"  OP's Dad is doing a seriously poor job of shoehorning fiancee in if they haven't even met her yet.  It sounds more like icing out the old family until fiancee realised there might be money/gifts available.  \n\nI do feel slightly sorry for Luna, her mom is raising her to be an entitled nightmare if she's already demanding presents from people she's never met.  But not OP's circus or monkeys, she should consider how much contact she's willing to put up with from these people (and NEVER agree to babysit without payment up front!).", "I think that's great when everyone wants that. But my grandparents shouldn't be obligated to accept Luna as their granddaughter. It would be different imo, if it were my dad's parents.", "The blended family is comprised of OP\u2018s father and his new wife/both of their kids. The grandparents in question are OP\u2018s deceased mother\u2019s parents, which are not part of the ex son-in-law\u2018s new family.   It is not a reasonable expectation that they would be involved in their ex son-in-law\u2019s new family.  They are not part of the blending.", ">I hope someone buys her a cute locket.\n\nWell, her mother can do that. \n\n>its still a bit rude\n\nNot buying presents for your  your ex son in law's new stepkid doesn't mean you're rude. They're op's mom's parents, not dad's parents. They have 0 reason to even be in contact with the kid\n\n>You suck a tiny bit for not accepting Luna as a part of the family\n\nOp is 19, obviously at this age a stepsister won't be seen as a real sister."]}
