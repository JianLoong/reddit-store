My dad and his fianc\u00e9e were living together at the time and they brought me out to dinner to celebrate. Luna was also there and heard her mom ask about my locket and who bought it for me. Luna was suddenly all excited and talking about how they're about to be her grandparents too and would they buy her one. My dad said they probably would and we'd ask them, meaning he and I would. I looked at him like he was crazy but he ignored me.\n\nHe did, in fact, ask my grandparents later and they said no. They even asked him why they would buy her something. They have no relationship to her and will likely only see her on very rare occasions.

They also helped us get set up with some stuff. This bothered my dad's fianc\u00e9e a lot because they are yet to meet her or Luna and made no effort to do anything for Luna's birthday.\n\nSo she and my dad told them they would be invited to the wedding, which they must accept, and they must give Luna something sweet before the wedding as a symbol of her being adopted as a grandchild by them. Now again, these are my mom's parents, not my dad's. My grandparents told them it would not be happening.\n\nFast forward on and my dad and his fianc\u00e9e have complained about it constantly. My grandparents gave me a heads up that drama was going down over their refusal. My dad and his fianc\u00e9e said I should talk to my grandparents and tell them to knock it off and to treat my sister better than they are. I told them they shouldn't be such greedy assholes and that I am not going to ask my grandparents that. I told them Luna isn't my sister and even if she was, it would not obligate my grandparents to do anything for her unless they were my dad's parents.\n\nWe got into an argument over me calling them greedy assholes.

But he needs to have some tact if he wants to keep both his new partner and his former partner's family in his and OP's (before she became an adult) life.\n\nHe needs to get it in his head that the thing that made OP's mum their daughter is the fact that they raised the woman, not the fact that she was married to OP's dad.", "And on top of that, they said the grandparents will be invited to the wedding \"which they must accept!\" This is disgusting.", "Oh this is a good idea.  OP should tell her dad and his fiancee that she will talk to her grandparents about getting something sweet for Luna if Luna's dad's parents are equally involved with her life.", "THIS!  All of this!  OP ask them when you can expect a gift from fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents?  Turn the whole thing around so that they see it\u2019s a crazy ask. I suspect they have more money than his parents or fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents.", "This person is referring to a hypothetical situation. That it would be wrong to expect the Dad\u2019s fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents to buy things for OP.", "technically they wil  be step-sisters once dad marries her mother", "This is exactly what I think. OP\u2019s maternal grandparents are rich and now OP is an adult and dad is remarried so he has no more access to the fringe benefits of richness. He is trying to shoehorn Luna into the love and affection of strangers to get back into the country club.", "I agree. Luna\u2019s mother obviously feels entitled to OP\u2019s grandparents despite the fact that they are nothing to do with her in any way", "why should OP consider the girl her sister? OP is 19 years old, will likely be leaving home soon, has no bound to the girl whatsoever. relationships are built. they're not automatic just because the dad is remarrying.", "Don\u2019t listen to this person. The only people who would EXPECT your grandparents to buy expensive jewelry for their late daughter\u2019s husband\u2019s new wife\u2019s small daughter that they rarely see are people who are just as entitled. Just because someone makes a habit of using their child to get stuff because they bank on other people \u201cbeing the bigger person\u201d and \u201cnot making the child pay\u201d doesn\u2019t mean anyone has to let them. The blame for upsetting the child lies squarely with the parents who plant ideas in the child\u2019s head about what they should expect from people they have no reason to expect anything from.  Entitled people love to gaslight you about all the shit they think they\u2019re entitled to.", "Because it's the kind thing to do?  Evidently a lot of you don't know what kindness is.", "You might edit the post to include that it's your mother's parents.  It's implied but I didn't see it outright stated and that does make a difference.", "My guess with the information given. The gifts are a symbolic gesture for acceptance of the new sister.\n\nThe alternative is that her dad and his wife are evil greedy cynical people who would go to war for a few hundreds..... I stay with my analysis.", "Exactly- and hopefully the idiots will say \u2018Luna\u2019s dad? But he\u2019s no relation to you OP\u2019\n\nAlthough somehow I imagine they\u2019ll convince themselves \u2018that\u2019s different\u2019", " You're right to point out that relationships can't be forced,", "Step grandchild in-law ?", "This.  And she is SIX.", "The girl is 6 years old. In her eyes she sees it as gaining a sister. She is a child. Are you honestly going to tell me the 6 yo is going to be responsible for setting up play dates to get to know her step sister better? The OP sounds bitter in comparison.", "This is very true. To me it is SO weird to expect your future husband's late wife's parents to be doing all that for you and your kid. Like say hi if they say hi to him/his kids sure. But to expect them to treat them the same as the grandchildren they have from their late child is so entitled to me. Unless both sides are like very close.", "Luna and her mom won't be part of my grandparents family. My dad isn't even part of my grandparents family. It's two separate families. They are my mom's parents, not my dad's. My dad doesn't have any contact with his own.", "sit down and be quiet. ops deceased mothers parents have zero obligation to their former son in laws new family. he can go harass his own parents.", "So having the slightest or almost non-existent connection with someone will require them to treat that person as family? You may have missed it but these are the grandparents from her MOM\u2019S side. They are not obligated to treat their SON-IN-LAW\u2019S FIANCEE\u2019S DAUGHTER as their own. Why can\u2019t the grandparents from the dad\u2019s side do this? I\u2019m not sure if this comment is real or if you are just being sarcastic.", "The grandparents aren't related to Luna or her dad", "It\u2019s kind, but I\u2019m saying they will almost never cross paths. She will always be a stranger to them. They don\u2019t have a relationship with their former sil. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re neglecting a step child due to biology, they\u2019re simply not doting on an actual stranger that they will never see. If they were still having family dinners and spending time together, it would be a completely different scenario. No child should feel invisible to the people that are around them, but they truly aren\u2019t her grandparents or even close to enough to be considered friends. They\u2019re nothing more then the parents of his late wife.", "Good job not every family is the same", "They don't have to accept Lina. They aren't her family. They are OP's mom's parents, not her dad's.", "\n\n>The gifts are a symbolic gesture for acceptance of the new sister.\n\nand if the grandparents in question were ops fathers parents, then they'd have a leg to stand on. ops mothers parents do not need to accept her. she is not related to them in any way.", "Acceptance as what? They are no relation to her.", "They don\u2019t have to do shit for a kid who isn\u2019t their family.", "My misunderstanding.   Yeah, are they buying stuff for OP??", "But the fianc\u00e9e is just that, a fianc\u00e9e. OP is no relation to those people until her father marries their daughter.", "I don\u2019t understand this whole \u201cthey must do this and they must do that\u201d. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re 3 years old and your father can threaten to withhold their grandchild from seeing them. Exactly what leverage does your father think he has?\n\nAlso, watch out if your father has a child with the new wife. He\u2019ll claim this one is related to you so must be treated equally.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but your father is delusional and you\u2019re NTA.", "One other thing- prepare for the demands for free babysitting. They\u2019re coming.", "Man, you guys are some hardhearted screwed up kind of people.", "No, I'm not delusional, but you and your grandparents evidently are!  This is an innocent little girl.  She didn't ask to be a part of your f-cked up family dynamic or your hateful, exclusionary nonsense.  It doesn't matter if they're not related.  It also doesn't matter if they rarely see her.  When they do, they can extend her the courtesy of treating her like a family member instead of an intruder.  The fact that you can't seem to see that is disturbing.", "That's probably why he's trying to force them to step up. Unfortunately, it's *his* parents who will be Luna's step-grandparents, not his former in-laws. Your dad is acting very entitled.", "or future stepmom's parents, or Luna's bio dad's parents...", "So\u2026 exactly the same as how Luna is no relation to OP until they get married? That\u2019s the point. They will still have more of a relationship than OPs grandparents ever will with Luna", "Even then its just step mum & step sister. OP can actually choose to have nothing to do with them even when her bio dad marries her. I had nothing to do with my dad's 3rd wife & her children.", "Would you adopt a random kid as your grankid? Because that's all Luna is to them. Their ex-SIL's stepdaughter isn't their grandchild by blood or by choice.", "if want to link hands and sing we are the world with every random person you meet, more power to you, but the rest of us understand that's not how the wrold works. op is the only grandchild of her mother's parents. that's just facts. luna has grandparents from her mother, ops father, and her own father. they don't need to harass ops deceased mothers parents", "I'm not OP. Reading is fundamental.\n\nNot having a relationship with someone who is not family is not hateful. Am I supposed to have relationships with every random kid that is not related to me? Wow. Get off your high horse.", "THEY. ARE. NOT. HER. GRANDPARENTS. ops father and step mother can go harass his own parents. they're the ones who are actually family by marriage", "Some people seem to have really strange ideas about what is and isn\u2019t family. \nSomeone who married the guy that used to be married to my cousins cousins niece on the other side of her family expects me to get them a gift cos I\u2019m their cousin\u2026ermmm no I\u2019m not! \nNTA, your grandparents are NTA. Only AH here are your Dad, soon to be stepmom and Linux4ever_Leo", "Luna will remain no relation to OP even when her dad marries Luna\u2019s mom.", "So what?!?  Why would you shun and discard an innocent child who married into the family?!?  Wow!", "LMAO!  You're not the OP but evidently you share her sentiments.  No, obviously you are not expected to have a relationship with every kid that you're not related to.  Duh, nobody said you should.  But if you were the OP, this kid would be your father's step-child.  Obviously you would want to have a good relationship with her and welcome her into the family.  She's an innocent six year old for god's sake.  The grandparents should do the same.  It doesn't matter if you see her once a year or once every five years, she's still your father's step-child and your grandparent's step-grandchild.  To treat this innocent girl as if she's a total stranger who isn't worth your time is simply cruel.  Why you can't seem to see that is disturbing.", "or the future stepmom's parents, or Luna's bio dad's parents...", "they'll be step sisters", "Into what family dude? You're legit delusional, the grandparents are not part of the dad's family, wtf are you on about", "You are fucking wild, man. Why are you having such a hard time grasping this situation?", "She's not their step-grandchild. These are my mother's parents not my father's!! My dad is not their son. So therefore my grandparents are not Luna's stepgrandparents!!", ">grandparent's step-grandchild\n\n... And if the new wife has an ex husband that marries another woman that has a kid from another man they should pay for her as well because that child will be their : step - grad child - step sister or brother from her bio father's new wife's ex husband's new wife's  side.\n\nAnd so it goes", "Apparently you can't comprehend the text you read, the grandparents are OP's mom parents, not related to the dad who's remarrying. They have no connection to the kid, no obligation to be in the kids life and even less any financial obligations, please refer me to you dealer cause you seen to be on some good shit", "You have a real problem understanding things. The grandparents are the parents of OPs deceased mother. They are not the father's parents. The father has his own parents and so does the fiance. You are making absolutely no sense and insulting people who have done and said nothing wrong. The fiance and father are insane and entitled. You should really take the time to think before you get angry and start arguing with and insulting people. You are 100% wrong here.", "Okay i did some extra work.\n\nhttps://ibb.co/dB85Gns\n\nAll of these kids are innocent children! So should OP's grand parents be responsible for all of them?\n\nWhen does the reverse expansion stop?", "Not unless OP's father adopts Luna, they aren't. But OP's maternal grandparents still have no relation to her."]}
