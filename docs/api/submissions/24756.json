My mom died 4 years ago and dad and her were still married and he still has some contact with her family. But since I moved out last year it has been less than when I lived there. I'm 19f btw.\n\nSo what happened is my grandparents bought me this really sweet locket for my birthday. My dad and his fianc\u00e9e were living together at the time and they brought me out to dinner to celebrate. Luna was also there and heard her mom ask about my locket and who bought it for me. Luna was suddenly all excited and talking about how they're about to be her grandparents too and would they buy her one. My dad said they probably would and we'd ask them, meaning he and I would. I looked at him like he was crazy but he ignored me.\n\nHe did, in fact, ask my grandparents later and they said no. They even asked him why they would buy her something. They have no relationship to her and will likely only see her on very rare occasions. He was pissy at them for their response but I was like, uh yeah, that makes sense to me.\n\nSo my grandparents helped me and my friends move into an apartment together over the summer. They also helped us get set up with some stuff. This bothered my dad's fianc\u00e9e a lot because they are yet to meet her or Luna and made no effort to do anything for Luna's birthday.\n\nSo she and my dad told them they would be invited to the wedding, which they must accept, and they must give Luna something sweet before the wedding as a symbol of her being adopted as a grandchild by them. Now again, these are my mom's parents, not my dad's. My grandparents told them it would not be happening.\n\nFast forward on and my dad and his fianc\u00e9e have complained about it constantly. My grandparents gave me a heads up that drama was going down over their refusal. My dad and his fianc\u00e9e said I should talk to my grandparents and tell them to knock it off and to treat my sister better than they are. I told them they shouldn't be such greedy assholes and that I am not going to ask my grandparents that. I told them Luna isn't my sister and even if she was, it would not obligate my grandparents to do anything for her unless they were my dad's parents.\n\nWe got into an argument over me calling them greedy assholes.

They damn sure don't owe his soon to be stepdaughter or his fiance anything.", "[removed]", "In addition to stepmom\u2019s parents, there are Luna\u2019s bio-dads parents and OP dads parents. The only reason to be this way about OP\u2019s mom parents is that they must be much richer", "#THIS", "Seriously, OP\u2019s an adult and he\u2019s marrying a new woman. The most contact they should have with him is *maybe* a Christmas card. The grandparents should go NC with him now before they start asking what Luna\u2019s getting in the will.", "My dad doesn't have any contact with his parents so not around. I never met them. My mom only did once and that was very early in their relationship.", "Why would it speak to a lack of compassion on their part when Luna is nothing to them? They hardly even see my dad let alone Luna. They see me often but that's because I'm their family.", "They aren't unifying a family, her father is trying to force his FORMER in laws to play grandparents to a child they have no connection to. These \"grandparents\" are the parents of his deceased wife and are under no obligation to do anything for OPs father, stepmother or stepsister.  The grandparents have been vocal about not wanting to be part of this nonsense multiple times.  OPs father and stepmom are delusional. OP is 19 years old, and doesn't live at home....stepsister is 6, it's highly unlikely they would ever have any type of sibling relationship. Very confused as to how OP is the AH", "So their former IL, have to treat the brand new stepdaughter of op father with parity as the actual grandchild that they have a relationship for the last 19y and is already an adult? \n\nAre you well?", "Gifts are not needed to unite a family.", "One of her three sets of grandparents (biological and step) can buy her a locket then.", "Not step-grandbaby!  This is her late mother's parents...  no relationship at all to that child..", "Not if the NINETEEN year old offspring does NOT want to be involved.", "> I genuinely cannot imagine having the audacity to go to the parents of a woman who died and basically say \u2018we\u2019re your new daughter and grandchild, forget about your child, give us your money!\u2019\n\nYup. I mean, they lived every parent\u2019s worst nightmare, having to bury their own child. This is just adding insult to injury.", "It\u2019s her mum and soon to be step dad that are telling her that they are her grandparents and should buy her stuff.  \nThey need to explain to her that they are not.  \nI don\u2019t think Luna is at fault here. \nShe\u2019s just being confused by her parents", "Oh my gosh, what a terrible thing to say.  Luna is about to become part of the family, as is her mother.  You and your grandparents seem like horrible people, I'm sorry but I'm just going to flat out say it.", "Eh.

They are not related. There is nothing wrong or bad about not having a relationship with someone that you'll rarely see.  That's insane.", "Well good for you. That does not mean that the OPs grandparents should do the same and accept the stepchild of their former son-in-law."]}
