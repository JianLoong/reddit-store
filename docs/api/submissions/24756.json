My mom died 4 years ago and dad and her were still married and he still has some contact with her family. But since I moved out last year it has been less than when I lived there.

My dad and his fianc\u00e9e were living together at the time and they brought me out to dinner to celebrate. Luna was also there and heard her mom ask about my locket and who bought it for me. Luna was suddenly all excited and talking about how they're about to be her grandparents too and would they buy her one. My dad said they probably would and we'd ask them, meaning he and I would. I looked at him like he was crazy but he ignored me.\n\nHe did, in fact, ask my grandparents later and they said no. They even asked him why they would buy her something. They have no relationship to her and will likely only see her on very rare occasions. He was pissy at them for their response but I was like, uh yeah, that makes sense to me.\n\nSo my grandparents helped me and my friends move into an apartment together over the summer. They also helped us get set up with some stuff. This bothered my dad's fianc\u00e9e a lot because they are yet to meet her or Luna and made no effort to do anything for Luna's birthday.\n\nSo she and my dad told them they would be invited to the wedding, which they must accept, and they must give Luna something sweet before the wedding as a symbol of her being adopted as a grandchild by them. Now again, these are my mom's parents, not my dad's. My grandparents told them it would not be happening.\n\nFast forward on and my dad and his fianc\u00e9e have complained about it constantly. My grandparents gave me a heads up that drama was going down over their refusal. My dad and his fianc\u00e9e said I should talk to my grandparents and tell them to knock it off and to treat my sister better than they are. I told them they shouldn't be such greedy assholes and that I am not going to ask my grandparents that. I told them Luna isn't my sister and even if she was, it would not obligate my grandparents to do anything for her unless they were my dad's parents.\n\nWe got into an argument over me calling them greedy assholes.

This isn't her family at all.", "Although I do agree. I would think that the dad would hope that he can build up a family unit that has harmony. \nIt's a difficult situation to gauge what happened and what affect it had on the family", "No, she died of leukemia.", "Not OP's job to do it, but the parents are obviously not doing it right.", "The father is still in contact with the grandparents (although admittedly less frequest recently, its still regular contact). The original question I responded too asked if the grandparents income significantly more. No answer there, but my thought process is this...if there is no financial gain to ask for a gift, how do we know that the motivation is greed and not seeking out acceptance from his In-Laws for moving on. The daughter has no interest in getting to know the 6 year old soon to be step sister. It tells me she has no interest in getting to know the people that her father has chosen to move on with his life with. IF there is no financial gain, then it highlights the daughters resentment. Again, if there is significant money at play, then sure Greed could be the answer, but the problem is, the OPs post is not clear in that regard.", "Nobody is being \"punished\", they're simply not buying her anything.", "You missed the part where I said demanding a gift is rude and entitled", "She's not joining into this family.", "And....she's wrong.", "No, it\u2019s her step sister.

OP owes the kid zero. Her mom is the one responsible for fixing what she clearly broke.", "No, it's not.", "OP is the stepsister, OP's grandparents aren't related to the kid.

They are acting like greedy assholes. If you don't want to get called that, don't act like it. Just because somebody is related to you, or is your parent does not mean that you don't get to call them out when they're being disrespectful and greedy. \n\nPointing out the truth is not disrespectful in this instance.

Just because OP's dad married the fiancee, that doesn't mean the new stepmom will *replace their lost daughter,* that's just wrong.  And if they're expecting the grandparents to \"adopt\" Luna as a granddaughter, that's kind of what they're implying.

Someone has died in this family that Luna and you the step mother are not a part of. A broken family is the one the step mother has already created by not being with Luna's Dad.  This is like going to a job you don't work for and asking for a check. They don't have any reason to owe you a dime. Luna only thinks what she has been told. The only family she has that's new is new step grandparents from his step father. Let the OP's mother rest. When something happens to the step mother one day. Do you think that OP will ask them for anything. \n\nGive Luna a $5 locket and explain the truth. You are giving her insane expectations for false reality. Also, you are glorifying OP's grandparents whose to say if they did give her a locket and never talk to her or ever treat her the same that that wouldn't hurt her more in the long run. To be treated as a burden, problem and eyesore bc the step mom is refusing reality. She'll grow up expecting everything at the OP gets but will never receive as she will only be a stranger to them!
