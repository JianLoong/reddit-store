I'm active in the plumbing subreddit and don't want this attached to my account.\n\nI've been a self employed plumber for about a decade.  Over the years, I've been bit twice on the job by dogs.  So one of my rules for doing work is dogs have to be locked away.  Its a request I make to everyone, no exceptions.  I don't care if your dog is friendly.  The 2 that bit me were supposedly just that.\n\nI got a call about that was described as an emergency and went to the job.  It was a couple in their 30's that answered.  They supposedly had a pipe heavily leaking/flooding.  They had no running water since they shut off the water main to the house.  I show up and I see they have a small dog, 10 pounds I'd guess.  I request they crate it or lock it in a room before I get started.  They get this baffled look on their face and say they don't lock their dog away for anyone.\n\nI explain my history with dogs on the job and say I won't do any work for you then.  They plead with me that its an emergency and they need running water again.  I hold firm and explain i'm not risking my safety.  They refused to put away the dog so I left.  Am I wrong to make a request like that?", "created_utc": 1678043172, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11j7wyd/aita_for_not_doing_a_job_because_dogs_werent/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have two cats.  They are friendly (too friendly, actually), but when anyone comes to do service or repairs to my house I lock them up in a bedroom until that person leaves.  It\u2019s safety and respect for everyone, plus I want the service person focused on the job not my pets.  You have every right to expect and require homeowners to secure their pets.  You are most definitely NTA.", "NTA. I leash my dogs in the house when I answer the door, properly introduce them to whatever repair person is saving my ass so they don't bark their heads off, then gate them into the living room so they don't get in the way.", "NTA. I\u2019ve had clients \u201cfriendly\u201d dogs charge me, only to find out they have a history with the town animal control.\n\nFuck no, dogs get locked away. They can call another plumber.", "NTA, I adopted two dogs, one is friendly, the other one a bit less so... Whenever I have people over, both of them are locked down. Having people over can be stressful for the dogs and they might react on unexpected ways. Locking them down is not only respectful to the people visiting but it's also less stressful for the dogs. The amount of people who do not realize this baffles me.", "NTA, keeping the dog free was more important to them than having water I guess.  My dogs would howl like crazy being locked up so I\u2019d likely put them in the yard or take them to a park to keep everyone happy.  \n\nMaybe if you framed it as concern for the dog\u2019s safety they\u2019d react better? Idk. I sure don\u2019t want my dogs bothering my husband while he is soldering or using caustic glue, and have no interest in my dog getting a shit shower either.  \n\nYou are there to preform a service for them that they need, they are asking for your time and expertise and the least they could do is provide a safe working environment", "NTA\nYou make your own rules in regards to your own safety.\n\nIf you didn't feel safe, you did exactly the right thing. :)", "NTA. Their burst pipe must not be that important or they would've locked their dog away. Hell, would putting the dog in the master bedroom and losing the door be that bad? They literally can stay with the dog is they care so much about the dog's well being xD", "NTA, I always warn people that are going to come in my home that I have a cat and lock him away to keep him from getting underfoot/making an escape attempt. If I had a dog I would do the same.", "SO MUCH NTA  \n\nHow ridiculous of them to have zero care for someone who already explained that they've been bitten by customers dogs in the past.  \n\nClueless.   You did the right thing.    \n\nWhy do both of them have to be present?   One can stay with you to show you stuff and the other can put a leash on the dog and take them to a different room or go for a walk.", "NTA at all. They want you to work in their home, so they need to accommodate your request to lock up the dog. \n\nFFS it's such a simple request, and their reaction is more appropriate coming from adolescents.", "NTA  Your only mistake, was not turning around immediately, and leaving. You were not obligated to work in a potentially unsafe environment with unsecured animals. Your insurance carrier would agree. Be sure to send an invoice for your travel time.", "NTA. Its a very reasonable request.", "NTA. It must not have been a huge emergency if they weren't willing to accommodate.", "Nta. People need to understand that if you aren't comfortable doing something then they should do something basic like put up their animal.", "NTA. You don't need anyone to tell you that any dog, no matter how friendly, can and will go beast mode if they feel sufficiently threatened.", "I had a mini dachshund that never hurt anyone, but when he got older he became a grouchy bastard. If he got scared or you got to close it wasn't unexpected for him to bite. It was random and he was an otherwise friendly dog. \n\nDoesn't matter the size, asking for pets to be locked up is reasonable. I would just for their safety. If I have people working on something I lock my cats up\nNTA", "NTA. You offered to do the work if they put the dog up for a few hours. They could have even put it outside. They chose not to. You chose not to work for them because of how unreasonable they were being.  They are the assholes.  \n\n\nI have an australian shepherd who barks her balls off anytime anyone comes to my house. She is a total coward and would never bite anyone, however she comes off as fierce.  So when we have people over to work, I always lock her up.", "NTA.\n\nIt's common sense to lock your dog away BEFORE even opening the door. Our family dog is very friendly, but that doesn't mean that everybody will feel comfortable around her.\n\nSounds like they didn't teach their dog properly. A little crate training and a special treat for those occassions, and the pup will be fine.", "NTA. That is a very fair rule. My cats don\u2019t bite anyone and I\u2019d still put them somewhere else so that they weren\u2019t underfoot (plus what if people are allergic?). Even if the dog was friendly, it well could have gotten in the way. There\u2019s no excuse for them to not oblige a very simple, reasonable, and temporary request.", "NTA. It\u2019s a reasonable request. They didn\u2019t want their pipe fixed that badly, it appears.", "NTA I guess they didn't really need running water, then. \n\nThey must be new to home ownership to not realize how much they need you! Not only will I crate my pets, but if a plumber is there to save my ass a full turkey dinner wouldn't be out of the question.", "Yta", "NTA. \n\nEven if you hadn't had bad run ins with dogs in the past, having a requirement that dogs be kept out of your working area(s) for the obvious reasons.", "NTA\nI used to always lock away my dog if someone came to repare anything. He was a bigger dog and tended to get in the way while trying to play with whoever it was haha \nIts a fair request to want to work without distractions or worry about your own safety.", "NTA. Must not have been that big an emergency if they were unwilling to put their dog in a room for a few hours.", "NTA.  Extremely reasonable request.  Pets get in the way-- even if it weren't a safety issue, which it is, getting a professional distracted in the middle of repair work is not smart.", "NTA. You gave them your terms and they didn\u2019t agree. That\u2019s on them.", "NTA", "NTA, I\u2019m a medic, I\u2019ve been bitten and snapped at many times. Small dogs are the worst. I will refuse to enter a home in an actual emergency because of a dog that isn\u2019t contained if I feel it necessary. They didn\u2019t care too much about water if they weren\u2019t willing to contain the dog for a short period of time.", "NTA\nCustomer needs to remove obstacles If the customer wants work to be completed", " NTA. We have had kept our kids managed when our plumber drops by, it\u2019s not unreasonable to keep a pet in another room. They\u2019re the ones to choose a free roaming dog over their home maintenance. You are doing great for maintaining a professional boundary!", "NTA - if water was important enough for them, they would\u2019ve found a solution for the dog. This could be taking it for a drive, walk, trip to the store for pet treats, anything that would remove it from your vicinity. \n\nThey should\u2019ve just complied with your request.", "Never wrong in this situation. As a construction person, dogs roaming free is a no go in my book. Too many things can happen to the dog as well. They're gonna find out the hard way this is almost always the rule.\n\nNTA", "NTA\nWhenever we have people coming over to do maintenance i always let them know at the door that i have a dog and to give me a few seconds to put her away.\nYes, she's super friendly, but I'd rather not her get in the way or assume that just because i love her doesn't mean other people will.", "They don\u2019t lock the dog up for anybody? You can respect that. You also don\u2019t change your personal safety rule for anybody ether. They need to respect that too. At the end of the day, you have running water at your house. \ud83d\ude04", "NTA, what they couldn't take the dog for a walk, or to a doggy daycare?", "NTA. I lock our cats up every time a repair person comes in. For safety and for my piece of mind. What if the pet runs out? Bites you? Pees on your stuff. My cats will 100% try to climb in your toolbags. Its safer for everyone", "NTA - one of them could have taken the dog for a car ride or a walk.  Your request was perfectly reasonable.  they were the AHs.", "NTA that's your rules for your safety. They chose to not comply.", "NTA I love dogs, but I think your request is entirely reasonable.", "NTA Those are weird people. Thats such a small ask.", "Nta\n\nIf it was such an emergency they would have locked it away.", "NTA that\u2019s a reasonable and pretty standard request. They can find a different plumber.", "I used to work as a furniture remover. I lost count of the number of times I had to move a huge, heavy piece of furniture with some fucking dog underfoot while the idiot owner was chuckling \"ooh, come here (dog), you're so naughty\". I never deliberately trod on a dog but a few bits of furniture and owners ornaments got \"accidentally\" damaged as a result. Wankers.\n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nWe always put up our dog when having a repair person over. It's basic courtesy to me. You never know what is someone's comfortabality with dogs, so we just put him up with a gate. Also you're there to do a job, you don't need my doggo running around getting in the way.", "Nope, they are wrong. Definitely NTA. I grew up with and have owned a few dogs in the past. We always locked the dog up when service men had to do work not so much for the service men's safety but for the dogs. Dogs will smell, lick and sometimes eat products used by the plumbers, painters, etc without anyone noticing until it's too late and they have a bad reaction.", "NTA. It\u2019s reasonable and I can\u2019t imagine a dog loose while there someone is working with tools, openings in walls/small spaces and possibly going in/out of the house is safe for you OR the dog.", "NTA.  They sound like completely irresponsible dog owners.  I\u2019d never let one of my dogs encounter a strange in the home.  That\u2019s just asking for problems.  What you requested is the safest thing for everyone.", "NTA. Guess they didn't need water enough to do the barest minimum to manage their household so you could work.", "NTA. Your rule is very fair. \n\nTbh, I think it\u2019s rude to not lock away a dog when there\u2019s a worker at your home. The worker (you) doesn\u2019t want to deal with the dog in their space.", "NTA - I love dogs, but this is a reasonable request. If they weren\u2019t comfortable locking the dog away because there\u2019s an issue with separation anxiety or something, one of them could have taken the dog out for a long walk. It\u2019s very common for professionals to ask this so I wonder why they seemed so baffled!", "NTA\n\nI'm a crazy dog owning millennial and even I thing these people were totally unreasonable.\n\n If they were so concerned about their dog being alone in another room they could have taken it on a walk, or one of them could have stayed in the other room with the dog. Requiring dogs to not be in the way, friendly or not, is a completely appropriate policy. You'd even be justified charging them for wasting your time.", "NTA.  This is a very reasonable request.  Even if the dog is friendly what happens if it knocks into you while working?  You could get hurt, the dog could get hurt or you could break something.  It\u2019s very dangerous to have animals around workers.  It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of work.  The dog would be just fine locked in a bedroom.  My dog is very friendly, old and lazy and I always put her in the backyard when someone is here for repairs.", "NTA. I was a contractor for years and always required that folks crate or leash their dogs when I was onsite. I just told people it was a requirement of my liability insurance. You might try doing the same.", "NTA. They have a right to not crate their dog and enjoy their new water feature. You have a right to not risk your safety on a job.", "NTA. I\u2019ve got four dogs, they always go up or outside when anyone comes over, no matter what. Dogs are still animals, and having a stranger in the house is stressful. I\u2019ve also been on the other end, and have been chased and almost attacked by a dog simply for trying to approach a driveway to do my job. It\u2019s scary.", "NTA. It couldn't be that bad if they refused to lock up the dog while you are there.\n\nSome of those little dogs can be terrors at biting people because they don't get properly trained. They may be little but they are still dogs.", "NTA. It\u2019s also smart from a liability perspective - even if the dog is harmless, it could get in your way causing you to trip, drop something on it, etc. Or you could go out to your truck and accidentally let it out.", "NTA. I love dogs, and have had them most of my life.\n\nWhen I was a teen, I had a paper route, and the only two dogs that ever attacked me were Yorkies, even shredded my canvas shoulder bag.\n\nIf a tradesman/workman wants me to put up my dogs, up they'll be put.", "My Mom has a huge dog that has never bitten a stranger and we still put him in her room for safety (unless the plumber needs to go in there, in which case he gets locked in the other bedroom).\n\nNTA OP.", "NTA The have an emergency. One person can stay with the dog in snother room and play, even take him in the dog park. You want to work without worrying for the animal. So many owner think their dog is friendly. But you are a stranger in their house and you never know how the instincts of the animal to defend their home kick in. \n\nI have 15 birds. They don't disturb anyone. They also don't fly at people. But if i know someone comes and works at my hone, i put them in their cage (normally they are free fly 24/7). It is for their own safety. Often those people go in and out because they need stuff and i don't want that they get out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
