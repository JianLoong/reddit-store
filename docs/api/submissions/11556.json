I'm active in the plumbing subreddit and don't want this attached to my account.\n\nI've been a self employed plumber for about a decade.  Over the years, I've been bit twice on the job by dogs.

The 2 that bit me were supposedly just that.\n\nI got a call about that was described as an emergency and went to the job.  It was a couple in their 30's that answered.  They supposedly had a pipe heavily leaking/flooding.  They had no running water since they shut off the water main to the house.  I show up and I see they have a small dog, 10 pounds I'd guess.  I request they crate it or lock it in a room before I get started.  They get this baffled look on their face and say they don't lock their dog away for anyone.\n\nI explain my history with dogs on the job and say I won't do any work for you then.  They plead with me that its an emergency and they need running water again.  I hold firm and explain i'm not risking my safety.  They refused to put away the dog so I left.

The amount of people who do not realize this baffles me.", "NTA, keeping the dog free was more important to them than having water I guess.

Must not have been that big an emergency if they were unwilling to put their dog in a room for a few hours.", "NTA.  Extremely reasonable request.

We always locked the dog up when service men had to do work not so much for the service men's safety but for the dogs.

It\u2019s reasonable and I can\u2019t imagine a dog loose while there someone is working with tools, openings in walls/small spaces and possibly going in/out of the house is safe for you OR the dog.", "NTA.  They sound like completely irresponsible dog owners.  I\u2019d never let one of my dogs encounter a strange in the home.  That\u2019s just asking for problems.  What you requested is the safest thing for everyone.", "NTA. Guess they didn't need water enough to do the barest minimum to manage their household so you could work.", "NTA. Your rule is very fair. \n\nTbh, I think it\u2019s rude to not lock away a dog when there\u2019s a worker at your home. The worker (you) doesn\u2019t want to deal with the dog in their space.", "NTA - I love dogs, but this is a reasonable request. If they weren\u2019t comfortable locking the dog away because there\u2019s an issue with separation anxiety or something, one of them could have taken the dog out for a long walk. It\u2019s very common for professionals to ask this so I wonder why they seemed so baffled!", "NTA\n\nI'm a crazy dog owning millennial and even I thing these people were totally unreasonable.\n\n If they were so concerned about their dog being alone in another room they could have taken it on a walk, or one of them could have stayed in the other room with the dog. Requiring dogs to not be in the way, friendly or not, is a completely appropriate policy. You'd even be justified charging them for wasting your time.", "NTA.  This is a very reasonable request.  Even if the dog is friendly what happens if it knocks into you while working?  You could get hurt, the dog could get hurt or you could break something.  It\u2019s very dangerous to have animals around workers.  It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of work.  The dog would be just fine locked in a bedroom.  My dog is very friendly, old and lazy and I always put her in the backyard when someone is here for repairs.", "NTA. I was a contractor for years and always required that folks crate or leash their dogs when I was onsite. I just told people it was a requirement of my liability insurance. You might try doing the same.", "NTA. They have a right to not crate their dog and enjoy their new water feature. You have a right to not risk your safety on a job.", "NTA. I\u2019ve got four dogs, they always go up or outside when anyone comes over, no matter what. Dogs are still animals, and having a stranger in the house is stressful.

They may be little but they are still dogs.", "NTA.

They were in the basement, though, so it wasn't too hard to keep her out of the basement. When they were carting stuff in and out a lot, I took her upstairs to hang out in the guest room with me with the door closed so she wouldn't chase after them begging for pets every time they came up the stairs.", "My ex had a not very friendly dog. My MIL had some work done on her house. We lived on her property so the dog was also always there. They didn\u2019t want to lock her up for who knows why. Well sure as shit the dog bit one of the workers. My ex MIL had to pay his dr bill and we had to keep her tied up for 2 weeks to prove she didn\u2019t have rabies. People get stupid with their pets. I don\u2019t understand this!", "Not to mention if he reports that dog for biting, they might have to put the dog down. I wouldn't take that risk. My mother in laws dog is a really old dog and doesn't bother anyone for anything unless it's food or outside. Sometimes pets, but usually of she's been alone all day. But otherwise she's in another room most likely asleep. She only growls at one dog who barks in her face and tries to play aggressively and that's the only way she can get that other dog to back off. But yeah, if a worker asked, we'd put her away. It's just common decency", "I used to do meter work for the power company and we were allowed to walk away from a job no questions asked if they had animals on the loose.", "Aside from allergies, dogs that are protective of their home, overly friendly dogs, if people are routinely entering and exiting your home if the dog is not put away the owners run the risk of it getting out. I know if my dog gets out, he\u2019s gone. Hound mix and can\u2019t be trusted off leash.", "little dogs are mean as hell", "It is for the dog's safety too.", "Is he going to have to explicitly state every single condition over the phone every time he books especially as an emergency? It's a dog's caretaker's duty to take care of a dog, not the other way around.", "At the minimum, a friendly dog is in the way wanting pets. Distracting you from doing the job.", "All my pets (2 dogs and 2 cats) are super friendly and I still cordone them off somewhere else when unknown people come over. It's just for the basic safety and comfort for everyone, including the pets.", "For real, if they were friendly they'd quite likely get in the way!", "We always lock our dog in a room when someone comes to work in the house because she'll just get in the way cuz she wants their attention. She's never bitten anyone either she can't even kill a fly but she loves to jump and tackle people. Our trainer is working on her with that but it's a process", "Greetings sir, madam\n\nI have come to collect Our Majesty\u2019s cat tax. If you could please present it at once, we will be on our way.\n\nGood day", "Disagree. I think it's a logical step on the part of a homeowner - not just to keep pets physically out of the way and from anything harmful the tradies might be using that they could get into, but just out of respect that not all people like dogs. They've come to WORK, they shouldn't have to deal with pets, even if they really like them.", "[This is my Mattie cat](https://imgur.com/ZDLu3zl). She'll be 10 this year and is just over 7lbs. She's normally a giant floof but *SOMEONE* doesn't let us brush her so she had to get a haircut because of the matts in her fur that inevitably happen. She's chilling next to me on my electric blanket while I was trying to work.", "My friend's dog has anxiety so we took turns babysitting the dog in the basement during Thanksgiving.  (He was too anxious around the big group, particularly the kids, but he knows a couple of us).  It really wasn't a big deal.  They were a couple, why didn't one of them just take the dog on a walk or sit with the dog?", "I agree as a a dog lover myself, it seems like a logical thing to put the pets away. However, I have learnt that not all people follow the same \"logic\" path as I do.\n\nAnd some pet owners are more \"passionate\" about their dogs etc.\n\nI don't see the harm in adding it to OP's policy or atleast have some sort of  reminder or disclaimer.  Plus I think of it more as \"filtering\" out the customers you don't want to deal with or work for.\n\n\"Do you really want to do a  job for people that wouldn't put their dog away?\" If not, then a disclaimer should filter out those tyoes of customers etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying OP is AH. I'm just making a suggestion so OP can avoid these awkward situations in future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: It's logical not to put electrical appliances into water and yet...\n\nSometimes there are less logical people in this world, and yes it sucks to cater to them sometimes but sometimes it's easier to \"cover your own ass\" with disclaimers etc.", "Logical or not, saves OP headaches", "I agree. When I hire a worker that will do something in my house that could be dangerous for my cats, I put them myself in another room. I have three cats but one of them in particular totally disregards all his personal (cational?) safety for the sake of his curiosity. The creature is 6 years old, already wasted all his 9 lives and then some more (that I always saved him from the dangerous things he wanted to do, and no, he doesn't leave the house, my cats are 100% indoors and we live in an apartment, but this one creature manages to create house accidents for himself if you let him). I love him, but let's face it, he's an idiot. :D", "Oh she looks like an angel \n\nA feisty angel but an angel"]}
