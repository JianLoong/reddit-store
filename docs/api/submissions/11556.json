I'm active in the plumbing subreddit and don't want this attached to my account.\n\nI've been a self employed plumber for about a decade.  Over the years, I've been bit twice on the job by dogs.

The 2 that bit me were supposedly just that.\n\nI got a call about that was described as an emergency and went to the job.  It was a couple in their 30's that answered.  They supposedly had a pipe heavily leaking/flooding.  They had no running water since they shut off the water main to the house.  I show up and I see they have a small dog, 10 pounds I'd guess.  I request they crate it or lock it in a room before I get started.  They get this baffled look on their face and say they don't lock their dog away for anyone.\n\nI explain my history with dogs on the job and say I won't do any work for you then.  They plead with me that its an emergency and they need running water again.  I hold firm and explain i'm not risking my safety.  They refused to put away the dog so I left.

They can call another plumber.", "NTA, I adopted two dogs, one is friendly, the other one a bit less so... Whenever I have people over, both of them are locked down. Having people over can be stressful for the dogs and they might react on unexpected ways. Locking them down is not only respectful to the people visiting but it's also less stressful for the dogs. The amount of people who do not realize this baffles me.", "NTA, keeping the dog free was more important to them than having water I guess.  My dogs would howl like crazy being locked up so I\u2019d likely put them in the yard or take them to a park to keep everyone happy.  \n\nMaybe if you framed it as concern for the dog\u2019s safety they\u2019d react better?

Must not have been that big an emergency if they were unwilling to put their dog in a room for a few hours.", "NTA.  Extremely reasonable request.

Also you're there to do a job, you don't need my doggo running around getting in the way.", "Nope, they are wrong. Definitely NTA. I grew up with and have owned a few dogs in the past. We always locked the dog up when service men had to do work not so much for the service men's safety but for the dogs. Dogs will smell, lick and sometimes eat products used by the plumbers, painters, etc without anyone noticing until it's too late and they have a bad reaction.", "NTA. It\u2019s reasonable and I can\u2019t imagine a dog loose while there someone is working with tools, openings in walls/small spaces and possibly going in/out of the house is safe for you OR the dog.", "NTA.  They sound like completely irresponsible dog owners.  I\u2019d never let one of my dogs encounter a strange in the home.  That\u2019s just asking for problems.  What you requested is the safest thing for everyone.", "NTA. Guess they didn't need water enough to do the barest minimum to manage their household so you could work.", "NTA. Your rule is very fair. \n\nTbh, I think it\u2019s rude to not lock away a dog when there\u2019s a worker at your home. The worker (you) doesn\u2019t want to deal with the dog in their space.", "NTA - I love dogs, but this is a reasonable request. If they weren\u2019t comfortable locking the dog away because there\u2019s an issue with separation anxiety or something, one of them could have taken the dog out for a long walk. It\u2019s very common for professionals to ask this so I wonder why they seemed so baffled!", "NTA\n\nI'm a crazy dog owning millennial and even I thing these people were totally unreasonable.\n\n If they were so concerned about their dog being alone in another room they could have taken it on a walk, or one of them could have stayed in the other room with the dog. Requiring dogs to not be in the way, friendly or not, is a completely appropriate policy. You'd even be justified charging them for wasting your time.", "NTA.  This is a very reasonable request.  Even if the dog is friendly what happens if it knocks into you while working?  You could get hurt, the dog could get hurt or you could break something.  It\u2019s very dangerous to have animals around workers.  It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of work.  The dog would be just fine locked in a bedroom.  My dog is very friendly, old and lazy and I always put her in the backyard when someone is here for repairs.", "NTA. I was a contractor for years and always required that folks crate or leash their dogs when I was onsite. I just told people it was a requirement of my liability insurance. You might try doing the same.", "NTA. They have a right to not crate their dog and enjoy their new water feature. You have a right to not risk your safety on a job.", "NTA. I\u2019ve got four dogs, they always go up or outside when anyone comes over, no matter what. Dogs are still animals, and having a stranger in the house is stressful.

It couldn't be that bad if they refused to lock up the dog while you are there.\n\nSome of those little dogs can be terrors at biting people because they don't get properly trained. They may be little but they are still dogs.", "NTA.

Any size dog, you put it away if visitors are uncomfortable.", "perfectly reasonable request from you. you did the correct thing to leave. any responsible pet owner is aware that not everyone gets on with animals.", "NTA.\n\nI have three dogs I adore, but I do my best to keep them away from people who have to come into my house. (Sometimes, they'll actually want to meet and pet the pups, which is fine, but I don't then just leave my dogs to wander freely around the whole house the rest of the time.) Aside from anything else, people who are here to do work on my house (*e.g.,* electrician, plumber) often have to go out to their truck at some point to grab this or that, and I don't want my dogs getting out.\n\nThose people were idiots. I guess they didn't really need that repair done.", "You dodged a bullet on that one!\n\nCan you imagine doing work for them if they cant agree to something as simple as you requested? They needed you but also demanded to drive the bus.", "NTA. I'm a subcontractor. We don't work unless the dogs are secured in an area away from us.", "NTA. That\u2019s completely reasonable.\n\nI\u2019d have locked up all the animals so you could work even before you arrived. It\u2019s not cute to have to push away a nosy cat/dog while trying to diagnose a problem. And I wouldn\u2019t want you to feel responsible if they got out when you were going in and out of the house \u2014 and I say feel because you wouldn\u2019t be responsible if a pet got out.", "NTA", "NTA - Dog bites are awful. You have a right to work without risking another one.", "INFO: I mean the dog was only ten pounds. Couldn\u2019t they have just held it or kept it away from you while you worked instead of completely locking it away?", "NTA, but in the future, if I were you, I'd mention it on the phone before going to the job.", "They has a choice, either lock up the dog or continue to have no water.  They chose no water.  Them making that choice doesn\u2019t make you an ass hole.  NAH.", "I don't think Y T A, and I think this rule of yours is reasonable, but I think this type of requirement needs to me made at the time of booking, not when you arrive. I'd be a little salty too if the first time I heard about this requirement is when the plumber shows up to start working.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey did not lock away their dog, a reasonable boundary. You did not repair their problems with a dog there - that is reasonable, too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can still charge them for your travel time.", "Shit, I lock my *cat* away when anyone new is over. She's great with the family but anyone who doesn't live here makes her really wary and she's prone to hiss, bite and attack (she's only 7lbs but acts like she's a damned tiger. \ud83d\ude44) Generally it's for no longer than an hour, so she's good just hanging out in mine and my husband's room.", "OP is NTA, but I do think OP should make a it a personal policy to mention it before booking jobs.\nI know I've had tradies ask if I had pets because of dog allergies. \n\nI think most people would either understand or look at another plumber. At least it would save everyone's time with a call out.", "I always put my cats away in a room with a litter box, food and water. I don't want them accidently getting out or getting into shit.\n\n\nI used to be a handyman and usually if they resist putting away their animals, I explain 'if your animal walked into my open glue container, and glued themselves to the floor, you'd be mad at me, not yourself for not locking the dog up. I'm protecting myself and your dog.'", "Man one of them could have taken him for a walk or to the park or something if they were that adamant about not locking the dog up. \n\nOr just lock the dog up. It\u2019s a dog. They\u2019ll go to sleep after a few and not give a shit that they\u2019re locked up. It\u2019s not like it was somewhere unfamiliar to the dog.", "I crate my cat too when there's anyone over who isn't a friend.  If you are coming to work, she's in her crate.  It's professional, polite, good for her safety and yours, and heads off any insurance issues ahead of time.", "NTA. Agree, our cats are nosy AF. We usually keep them away from workers without being asked.", "Why?", "Yup I have a 14 1/2 year old beagle. Sweetest thing ever. But she loves people and can be clingy. Normally, she stays glued to my side, but she's a hound dog and is curious. I would totally close her in the bedroom or bathroom for a worker. Especially if they had this issue. I  don't want her being a nudge and getting in the way or getting soaked. \nRegardless they don't have to put the dog in a space by itself. One of them could have could gone to chill in a room with a closed door with the dog.", "I mean putting a dog in a room behind a door while you\u2019re already home for an hour or so and one of you being in the room with them shouldn\u2019t require advance notice for most people.", "Seriously, and it's for the dog's own safety too, usually, since plumbers and the like often have to go in and out to get repair materials, more specialized tools, etc out of their vehicles.", ">their reaction is more appropriate coming from adolescents.\n\nThis does not imply they see them as literal adolescents.\n\nLike if you call someone \"a big baby\" it does not imply you literally see them as an infant.", "Or just taken the dog for a walk.", "I have a beagle mix. He hates strangers and is very protective of his house and us. We just put him our room when we have people come to work on things. If we\u2019re both home one of us will stay in the room with him. It\u2019s not a hassle and it\u2019s safer for everyone.", "Ah, I see now, I misread your original comment slightly, my apologies."]}
