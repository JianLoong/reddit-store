Grace and I went out to drink a few days ago, just the two of us. We talked a bit about inflation and finances and she confessed to me that she barely has any money and it makes her feel really vulnerable.\n\nTurns out, they mostly live off of her income and Michael, who makes over 2.5 times as much as Grace, puts almost all of his income into savings. He also asks Grace to transfer any of her bonuses or extra money into that savings account.\n\nThe problem is that Grace has no access to that account. She told me she asked for it in the past, but Michael just said she already has access to their shared checking account (that is strictly for their monthly expenses), so it's fine. \n\nGrace told me that she feels like she should have access to that account too or at least have a little extra in her own personal account so if anything happens to Michael, she doesn't have to wait months to access the money. She told this to Michael too, but he dismissed her and said nothing will happen to him.\n\nI told Grace that this is really not okay and she should demand access to that account. It's her money too and it's not right that only Michael has access to it. I was very strong about this and made her promise that she will make Michael give access to her. She seemed very relieved that I agree with her and find her concerns more than reasonable.\n\nNow onto the problem: currently Micheal is throwing a fit at me for inserting myself into their financial life, saying it's none of my business. He says that over 85% of the money was put into the savings account by him and whatever Grace put there was just to compensate for the things Michael paid for alone in the past.\n\nYes, he is right that it's none of my business, but my close friend came to me saying she feels vulnerable, because at 30 years old, she only has about 500\u20ac in her name, despite having a well-paying job. Of course I will tell her this isn't right and encourage her to stand up for herself! But since I'm friends with Michael too, I don't know...

He's trying to make sure she has no funds to which she can use to separate their lives and he can claim all the money as his.   \n\nShe needed a huge wake-up call, and he's just mad you've shown her his true colors.", "NTA\n\nGrace is in a financially abusive relationship.", "This is financial abuse.

You gave advice to a good friend out of concern. Grace tried to have a conversation with her husband. Michael should try having 500 euros for a bank account balance.

It likely will not resolve just by telling her it's not right, most likely, and could escalate between them from there.", "NTA\nThe word you're looking for is \"financial abuse\". Michael is financially abusing Grace. Oh, all that money was put into savings by him? Right, after Grace paid for their living.\nSince you're using \u20ac I guess you're somewhere in the EU. They usually have protection for spouses in just such scenarios. In Germany, f\u00fcr example, all income is shared money, the exception being personal gifts and inheritances. Catch is, both partners are also allowed to spend that money. Grace urgently needs to look into the local law and see what her rights are.", "NTA. That spouse is a major red flag.", "NTA, what you did wasn't \"inserting myself into their financial life\", it was giving an indiviual some obvious, simple, and un-argueable advice, a husband kicking off about someone saying their wife shouldn't be destitude streches the bounds of believability.", "NTA.  Right is right and your relationship with either/both has no bearing on the issue.  The assets of the marriage belong to both parties equally.   Assets each party held before the marriage is personal, not community property.   That may not be so in some countries.  Grace should have unfettered access to family assets.  If husband won't put family funds into a joint account, then IMO, Grace should hire an attorney and force him to do it.", "NTA, she\u2019s being financially abused and controlled. I hope she gets help.", "NTA. Your friend came to you and talked to you about this situation. You gave your opinion/advise.   Your friend is being financially abused and at the very least, she REALLY needs to stop A) paying for everything on her income alone B) establish her own savings account that he does not have access to C) put all of her extra income/bonuses into THAT savings account.", "Uhm. NTA by a long shot, that's financial abuse right there.", "NTA. Michael is selfish and shady. He makes more money and gets to have a savings account and she has no access to it?  Grace is stressing about money and God know how much he\u2019s got in his account.", "Nta! You did for a friend what any good friend should, regardless of the relationship you have with their SO.

And I believe your advice was spit in, sounds like her husband is financially abusive. If he won\u2019t give her joint access to her own money, she absolutely should open her own account and start keeping her bonuses and extra money in that account. They can continue to split or pay the bills how they currently do but then she has full access to her own money! Her husband definitely sounds like TA!", "NTA. Normally I'd say their marital issues aren't your business, but the same rules don't apply when there's some sort of abuse going on. Financial abuse is real.

This is 100% financial abuse, good on you for looking out for your friend. This is really controlling and manipulative.", "NTA. he\u2019s pissed because you\u2019ve figured out he\u2019s financially abusing her. OP please help her. Michael is not a good person, you should prioritize Grace as your friend.", "NTA. Your friend is being financially abused.", "NTA\n\nIt does sound like financial abuse and encouraging someone to stand up for themselves in a responsible way isn't being an ahole, its being a good friend.  \n\nIf her husband is going to demand split finances then your friend needs to open her own account and start putting her \"extra\" money into it.", "NTA!

Because the only reason 85% is allegedly his is because they are using all of her money to pay expenses. So that account is 50-50 whether he likes it or not.", "NTA, he was stealing her life work from under her nose.", "NTA. Grace opened up to you about how financially vulnerable she felt. You offered her advice and support which she was grateful for. You did not butt in, you helped a friend.", "It wasn't your business until Grace confided in you about it, and then talking to Grace about it became your business. All you did was talk to her about a thing she wanted to talk about. \n\nNTA", "NTA\nAlthough this a very slippery slope for you be in. I could see a friendship deteriorate over this. Michael sounds as if he's doing something with the money he isn't supposed to or either he's controlling and selfish. Either way she needs to stand up for herself or at the very least refuse to add money to that account.", "NTA. Your friend really is in a vulnerable situation and her expressing her concerns to you just goes to show how worried she is about it. She came to you and got good advice which she\u2019ll hopefully take and act on.\n\nIt\u2019s unbelievable that she doesn\u2019t have access to an account that her money goes into. That\u2019s wrong and you\u2019re being a good friend, her husband may be angry because he\u2019s not in control anymore. I feel sorry for his wife, this is messed up.", "NTA\n\nBut just to be clear, it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t insert yourself. You just gave your opinion to someone that was looking for one. If you had on your own gone to Michael, that\u2019d be a different story.", "NTA for having an opinion when your friend asked for it.  My advice and question would have been if he doesn't give you access, than for her to open accounts solely in her name and deposit her funds there.  Contribute to the \"joint account\" for expense's and than let the chips land where they may.  What is happening is financial abuse.  And controlling as all heck.  It's hard for her to see while in it but it does seem that she's starting to get the gist of it.", "You gave a friend advice, which she definetly needed. Nta", "NTA - the principle that you should stay out of other people's affairs doesn't extend to ignoring abusive behaviour. Grace is obviously unhappy with the situation, hence asking to change it in the past, and the fact that he's throwing a tantrum now just shows why it's necessary for someone else to step in.", "NTA, you are looking out for your friend who is being taken advantage of financially. She was the one who brought it up and you gave your opinion. Michael sounds like an AH.", "NTA. Her husband is literally stealing her money from her.", "Wow for anyone, man or woman, to hold financial abuse over anyone is baffling. Why do people allow one person to hold all the money?? It\u2019s 2023. He makes 2.5 times what she does but all his money is in savings that only he had access to. All her money goes to pay bills. I would be noping the fuck outta that marriage. Makes no sense.", "NTA. If couples share finances,  both parties should have access to all accounts.", "Your friend asked you for advice and brought an obvious problem to your attention. That  makes it your business. Friends husband  needs to be paying for half of everything if his \"savings\" account is solely under his control. NTA", "Nta he\u2019s controlling and probably is spending the money that\u2019s in the savings account", "NTA. Your friend came to you for a sympathetic ear & advice, & you gave it. That's what one does with friends. If the guy has that big of a problem with it, he should quit financially abusing his wife.", "NTA. I would ask her what she's getting out of this marriage besides being poor?\n\nThe money is gone, it was gone the minute she gave any into his \"savings account\". Maybe a divorce lawyer can get back some or more of it to her, but that marriage is done for. What is she getting out of staying?", "NTA (?)\n\nTough one. Grace shared her dilemma with you her friend.. she seemed like she needed some advice or some support, because it sounds toxic what her husband is doing by making all that money be put up hostage. The concerns are very valid.\n\nThe husband being your friend also makes it kinda sticky. I may have given grace the advice of what I think she should do, but I wouldn\u2019t insist personally (knowing that it\u2019s between a couple).\n\nIt\u2019s really odd that he\u2019s doing that to her though \nGrace made it my business (ish) when she told me\nBut it\u2019s Michael\u2019s private life and maybe he might have a good reason that he doesn\u2019t need to tell me because it\u2019s his private business.", "NTA. Sometimes abuse victims don't know they're being abused, or aren't quite sure how to voice their opposition to such abuse, until someone they know and trust points it out. Being that you're also friends with Michael, it seems like she trusts your opinion more. Good on her for asserting herself and letting him know what she wants. He'll be angry, but it'll get worse if she doesn't stand up for herself. Maybe now she won't give him another dime.", "NTA. Financial abuse is real.", "Nta. Michael is definitely an abusive AH.
