{"id": 22819, "submission_id": "155ud52", "title": "AITA for declining to participate in a \"meal train\" for a woman with an able bodied husband and adult son living with her?", "selftext": "\\*I DO NOT GIVE PERMISSION FOR THIS POST TO BE SHARED OUTSIDE OF REDDIT \\*  So some ladies in our church occasionally send out invites for \"meal trains\" for people to sign up to bring meals for someone who recently had a baby or is sick or something like that. I get it. It's a nice idea to help people out. I have no problem and have participated sometimes in the past.\n\nLast week a meal train was posted for a lady named \"Sue\" (name changed obviously) who apparently had spent a few days in the hospital due to severe back pain. She's home now but still in pain and unable to do much. The meal signup stated about bringing a meal for 3 people. Sue lives with her husband and adult son. The husband and son work full time. Sue does not work.\n\nI decided not to sign up for this meal train because I also work full time. I figured if people want to, that's fine, but I don't have extra time to be cooking meals for people who have capable adults in the household to help out. Some people do have extra time, and that's great if they want to help out. Well, I'm guessing others felt this way too because the meal train just wasn't filling up very fast so they kept posting about it and posting about it. I kept ignoring it.\n\nLast night I got a call from a friend of Sue's. We'll call her Jane. Jane asked if I was aware that Sue had been in the hospital and if I could possibly sign up for a meal slot. I explained very nicely to Jane that I work full time and I don't often have time to make a full meal and that my husband and I usually just get our own meals or one of us cooks when we're able. She was like, \"Oh well that's ok. There are plenty of weekend slots availble too that you could sign up for when you're not working.\" I said, \"Well, aren't her husband and son home on the weekends? Couldn't they cook then?\" Jane got really snippy with me then and cut the conversation short. I told my husband about it and he thinks that I could have made time on the weekend to cook something and take it over just to be nice. I asked him why didn't he sign up then if he thought the needed meals on the weekend and he told me I was just trying to start an argument.\n\nI don't think I'm the AH because Sue's husband and grown son should be perfectly capable of cooking for Sue and themselves, especially on the weekend. But I might be the AH because I don't have much going on during the weekends and I COULD cook for them. I just don't see the need to.\n\nSo.........reddit.......AITA?", "created_utc": 1689960326, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155ud52/aita_for_declining_to_participate_in_a_meal_train/", "score": 13919, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they are going to be generous, the I prefer that they be generous with people that actually need it. I fully appreciate it what they did for us, but felt that they should have done it for someone else that really needed the help.\nEdited to add NTA", "NTA, why should you be pressured into cooking for a non relative who has a perfectly capable son and husband when you work full time.

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo some ladies in our church occasionally send out invites for \"meal trains\" for people to sign up to bring meals for someone who recently had a baby or is sick or something like that. I get it. It's a nice idea to help people out. I have no problem and have participated sometimes in the past.\n\nLast week a meal train was posted for a lady named \"Sue\" (name changed obviously) who apparently had spent a few days in the hospital due to severe back pain. She's home now but still in pain and unable to do much. The meal signup stated about bringing a meal for 3 people. Sue lives with her husband and adult son. The husband and son work full time. Sue does not work.\n\nI decided not to sign up for this meal train because I also work full time. I figured if people want to, that's fine, but I don't have extra time to be cooking meals for people who have capable adults in the household to help out. Some people do have extra time, and that's great if they want to help out. Well, I'm guessing others felt this way too because the meal train just wasn't filling up very fast so they kept posting about it and posting about it. I kept ignoring it.\n\nLast night I got a call from a friend of Sue's. We'll call her Jane. Jane asked if I was aware that Sue had been in the hospital and if I could possibly sign up for a meal slot. I explained very nicely to Jane that I work full time and I don't often have time to make a full meal and that my husband and I usually just get our own meals or one of us cooks when we're able. She was like, \"Oh well that's ok. There are plenty of weekend slots availble too that you could sign up for when you're not working.\" I said, \"Well, aren't her husband and son home on the weekends? Couldn't they cook then?\" Jane got really snippy with me then and cut the conversation short. I told my husband about it and he thinks that I could have made time on the weekend to cook something and take it over just to be nice. I asked him why didn't he sign up then if he thought the needed meals on the weekend and he told me I was just trying to start an argument. \n\nI don't think I'm the AH because Sue's husband and grown son should be perfectly capable of cooking for Sue and themselves, especially on the weekend. But I might be the AH because I don't have much going on during the weekends and I COULD cook for them. I just don't see the need to. \n\nSo.........reddit.......AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your husbands impulse to help them is laudable ... but he should do the helping himself!", "NTA.\n\nSue probably enabled her son\u2019s and husband\u2019s learned helplessness in the kitchen.

He can try setting the example this go-round", "NTA and your husband is an AH.", "One of the many reasons to avoid churches.", "NTA - your line of thinking is not selfish at all.

I don't mind volunteering for this sort of thing, especially when it's for brand-new parents and everyone's exhausted and overwrought adjusting.

It's easy for me, though, since I usually just make a double batch of what I'm already making for my family (I only work part time).\n\nImportantly, though, it needs to be a gift freely given, not a guilt offering to Jane's arm-twisting.

If there\u2019s been a death in the family or something then nobody being up to cooking is understandable, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here.

This is not a bad thing.", "Idk. I think NTA because ultimately this does sound like they don\u2019t absolutely need the help but I would really need more details. , I think tying your reason for denying assistance to there being adults in the house could easily bite you in the ass.

Sue and/or Jane may be more than happy to throw this back in your face. \n\nAgain, you\u2019re not an asshole.

Our church did something similar here, and we had the meal train with people bringing us dinners for months. Yes, my dad was healthy and able to make dinner, but having the meal train was a significant help, especially financially, as he was the main caregiver for my mom at the time, and she was no longer able to work. It made it so he didn't have to worry about paying for groceries for dinner, or putting extra time into cooking dinner for our family. Hospital bills (and in my case, chemotherapy), is extremely expensive and can make it hard to make sure there is enough money for all other expenses.\n\nThere were many times where the people would give us a giftcard, or order takeout for their day on the meal train.

It's a nice way of the church showing they care and make the person receiving know they have a community who cares.\nIf Sue isn't receiving any meals, that sends a message to her. Especially if she's one that usually gives meals to others (unsure if that's the case here).\n\nTLDR; It's not about a meal, buck up and make one.

These things are voluntary and if you don't feel like helping, then don't.  \n\nBut...\n\nYou're assuming two grown working adult men in her household should be able to handle the role of cooking meals.   What if they are really busy taking care of Sue as she is recovering, in addition to all the things Sue used to do, in addition to working?  What if one of them has to get up at night to help Sue to the bathroom, with meds, etc. and isn't able to sleep as well as they should?  What if money is tight due to the medical bills?   What if they have adjusted their working hours so that Sue isn't home alone and has full time care and that care takes alot of time?

I've known volunteers that dealt with elderly or those disabled or had surgery and often said that you never fully understand a living situation until you go and visit and see what the needs are.  Some people are even reluctant to ask for help such as this because they are judged harshly or think they don't need it and may often end up eating terrible food as a result when they need nourishing meals.  Some just need a little helping hand here and there.  It's possible someone did visit and recognize Sue and her family needed some help.  Just a thought.

Yes, my 76 year old father could have cooked but that would have been rather unkind to my mother, as he wasn't much of a cook.  Think tuna on toast, boxed mac n cheese, and the like.  Me and two siblings took care of providing meals on the week-ends.

You can't 'plan around' an injury.\n* Since this is 'church' and we assume everyone who has a baby is a married heterosexual couple, the husband should also be free to cook, by OP's logic.\n\nFrankly, if you separate the irrational emotional reaction that most people have, and think about this objectively, people who have babies are less deserving of help than the injured. They knew what they were getting into, and if they don't have time to take care of themselves, it was a poor life decision for them, and they shouldn't have kids.\n\nKind of wild how 'church' people apply whatever logic is convenient to them.

If husband and son are doing things like helping change her band-aids, keeping track of her medication, and helping her to the bathroom, all on top of full time jobs, I could see why it would be difficult to cook on top of that.\n\n There are also some surgeries where minimal care is needed after, I once had a surgical mole removal where all I needed was ice packs and basic painkillers, which I was able to get myself. \n\nAnyway, OP is allowed to say no and I don't think it's right for people to try and guilt her, but I don't like the whole game of deciding who's really struggling.", "OR... Are they really concerned about Sue, or more concerned that her husband and grown son won't have access to home-cooked dinners while she can't cook? Why on earth can't her family take care of her?

Being male isn't a disabilty when it comes to getting a meal on the table.

No. You would leave.\n\nEdit to add that is sounds like your husband is willing to volunteer you to do extra emotional and physical labor for a church you no longer feel community with. I know as a dude this is easy for me to say, but it seems like you need to have a serious conversation with your husband about why he feels okay doing that because I personally would find that invalidating to my agency. You are perfectly capable of deciding if, when, and how you are willing to help the church.", "It sounds like your husband\u2019s values do align with theirs, though.

You might need to step away regardless of what he chooses.", "The point being that OP and we don't know what their home life is like. Yes, it may seem like they have two perfectly abled adults, but it could be really difficult for the two because she may need a lot of help physically and care giver burnout is a thing so taking a load off can help that even slightly. But, it is also voluntary and she's within her right to say no because she also has her own life to attend to and that's fine. But making assumptions is not something anyone should do about someone they don't know. What seems to be the case can easily not be the case. Should she be berated? No. I don't think so. That's just ridiculous. Try to get someone willing to join the meal train instead", "Yes, that is her point.

Easy example: wife used to cut the grass and make sure bills are paid, husband cooked. Now husband does all those and helps wife with meds and walking around house both during the day and at night while still working. More tasks were added and there are less people to do them. This works for any size family, it\u2019s a family at less than 100 percent doing more than 100 percent of their normal tasks. It\u2019s more tasks for less people.

You have every right not to sign up and I understand why you wouldn't want to considering others in the house appear just as capable as you. That is why you are NTA.\n\nAnd then there is the fact that having a sick family member puts pressure on the entire family that isn't there otherwise. That is one way that their situation differs from yours.\n\nAlso, you have no true indicators of whether or not they are just as capable or whether or not they will. Invisible disabilities are real and could be at play. Or not. We don't know.\n\nIf the hubby and son are capable they still may not be willing. On the surface you could say that's on them and you have no responsibility here. Which is true. But the wife will then have undue pressure to either cook or starve and compassion would compel me to help her for her sake.\n\nI remember when I was with my ex. He was a narcissist who would withhold grocery money and never help around the house, accusing me of lying about my invisible disability. He was capable but the kids and I were the ones who suffered from his refusal.\n\nIdk if these are what is going on or not but they could be. Plus the aforementioned additional pressure and stress on the family because of a sick member", "My first boyfriend's parents were going on vacation.  His mom asked me to come over and do his laundry for him.  I couldn't help it.  I laughed and said \"The instructions are on the lid.\"", "I'm impressed! Drop a link to those patterns lol I can't knit...yet, but I have a starter kit & one day I will learn!", "Make a meal for one - for Sue\n\nCall her and ask her if she wants coffee and a croissant.  Or a special sandwich or some soup- and a cookie.\n\nJust for one", "Or, since we're on the subject, if she feels like helping, then have her husband cook some meals for the woman with the back surgery.\n\nWin-win.", "Grew up indie fundie baptist. Our preacher literally told my step-dad \u201cit\u2019s all fake, they\u2019re all stupid\u201d whenever he went to ask questions after going cover-to-cover for the 4th time. \n\nThe ones at the top know it\u2019s all bullshit. It\u2019s 100% a cult."]}
