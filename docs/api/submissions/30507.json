Needless to say, their relationship was over before the baby came.\n\nOur parents watched the baby so Mel could still attend college. She met a boy in one of her classes that was in pre-med, spent several months pursuing him until finally landing in a realationship with him, introduced him to the baby a few months in, learned he also wasn\u2019t interested in being a dad for a long time if ever, and still went off her BC and got pregnant a second time around. He tried to stay at first, but ended up getting accepted to a medical school across the country and basically left without another word.\n\nNow my sister is pregnant with an older man who is married who she\u2019s been having an affair with for the past year. She\u2019s claimed the entire time he\u2019s separated from his wife and getting divorced, but as soon as she told him she was pregnant he dumped her and went back to his wife.

Your sister is trying to baby-trap guys and is pissed off that it doesn\u2019t  work. You just told her the truth.", "NTA.  As the old saying goes, when you're pointing one finger of blame at others, remember that at least three of your fingers are pointing back at you.\n\nShe's tried the same thing three times: get pregnant and use that to force the man to marry her.  And still, she hasn't learned that no individual likes being entrapped in such a manner. For her children's sake, at least, I hope that she's gotten a good attorney to ensure that she's getting adequate child support payments.", "Your sister is the cautionary tale men whisper around campfires. The \u201cBaby Trapper,\u201d the Boogeywoman who destroys the strides women have made towards equality, the setback to feminism, the one who validates every misogynist on the internet. \n\nThe truth hurts. NTA", "NTA.\n\nThis story (if it's even real) hits some ragebait points. Your sister is essentially attempting to baby-trap affluent men (i.e., gold-digging) who can afford to take care of her and her kids.\n\nIf anything, you didn't go far enough. You sister's chances of landing a suitable man are about slim and none. First, we have her with two kids and collecting child support for neither. Plus another kid on the way.\n\nTry looking at it from the man's perspective. To us, your sister is essentially a dangerous risk. Even if a man is willing and could afford to take care of her and her kids, it would make no sense for him to do it. Women initiate the vast majority of divorces. And divorce can be for any cause or no cause.\n\nSo, let's say a guy comes along, falls in love with your sister and is willing to take on her and her two, soon-to-be three, children. And everything looks good. Her kids love him.\n\nBut then your sister, for whatever reason, decides she wants a divorce. Might not even be for any fault of his. She's just bored, she met someone else (and given your sister's rather mercenary approach to relationships, that wouldn't be surprising), or for whatever reason.\n\nNow, because her hypothetical husband has no claim to any of her three kids, he not only loses his wife, but he loses those three kids that he's bonded with. It makes no sense for a successful man to take that chance when your sister could start a divorce on a whim and take four people he cares about out of his life.\n\nEven if the danger of getting involved with a single mother doesn't even occur to her next boyfriend, you can bet the women in his life, like his mother, sisters, aunts, etc. will know exactly what your sister's up to and clue him in.\n\nYour sister has all but doomed any chance she has of a romantic relationship. And you are doing the right thing by telling her this.", "NTA \n\nYour sister has been trying (unsuccessfully) to baby-trap her boyfriends. This is not going to go over well and those men are not wrong for not marrying her. She needed to hear this, even though she does not like it. You were not in the wrong here.", "NTA. Your sister is. Having a baby without the father\u2019s consent is ahole behaviour when it\u2019s a deliberate act. To do it 3 times is despicable. Then to badmouth them because they\u2019re not interested in having a relationship, sheer ignorance. It was about time someone told her she was the problem", "NTA, seems like your sister is trying to use babies as traps for the men in her life. She\u2019s very irresponsible in her thinking and the only ones that are truly missing out are her kids.", "NTA There may have been a kinder, gentler way to approach it, but you spoke truth. I probably would\u2019ve approached more from the point of telling her that it\u2019s sad that she doesn\u2019t value herself enough to think that a man could want her unless she traps him & maybe she should get some help figuring out how to handle that before she does any more harm to herself & her children. I assume you want what\u2019s best for her & the kids in the end.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is constantly bringing kids into this world only thinking about herself rather than their future.   \n\nShe knows full well what she is doing getting pregnant each time.  If she is lying to you and your parents about things it wouldn't surprise me if she was also lying the men about being on birth control.  \n\nYour parents taking her side when you called her out on it is only reinforcing her behaviour and she will probably keep doing it until she finds someone who will stick around once she springs her trap.", "NTA-Your sister seems like a selfish monster who leaches onto men. You are perfectly in your right mind to lash out after hearing the same sob story repeatedly. She needs some serious counseling. Shes TA.", "NTA.  Your sister has been overestimating the power of her feminine allure since she was a teenager and has apparently not learned anything from any of her experiences.  She needs a wake-up call, not \"poor me\" support.  I'm sure your words were harsh, but they were true.  So sad for her innocent children.  \n\nSometimes the truth hurts, but it is still the truth.", "NTA The reason your sister is still upset about what you said is because the truth hurts. She deep down knows it\u2019s her fault but she doesn\u2019t want to accept it and you made it front and centre for her.", "NTA I tend to go by the rule of two when deciding whether to say something. 1. Is it true? 2. Is it necessary? 3. Is it kind?.  If 2/3 are there, I say it  And while it's not kind, what you told her is definitely true and necessary.  She's harming other people (her kids and their fathers) and your parents are enabling her.", "NTA \n\nSeems like your sister\u2019s got a bad case of trying to baby-trap men. She obviously is aiming too high since all the men are smart enough to steer clear. \n\nI wonder if this is your sister\u2019s plan for her life.. how many more hit and miss would she be willing to take. \n\nShe needed to hear what you said and your parents are in the wrong for trying to undo the reality check you gave her.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a manipulative AH.", "NTA your sister is crazy. \n\nThree times she pulled the same stunt, three times she got the same result.", "NTA. Sometimes the truth hurts. Someone needed to tell her. My grandma always said \u201csometimes we make our lives harder than they need to be; we make our own messes.\u201d This is her life now. Your sister should consider a tubal ligation since she doesn\u2019t make smart choices about procreation.", "Sure dude. 100% believable story.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"\"there is something in the air , yes , your legs\"  ...sorry but had to ..lol", "NTA. Those kids are gonna have it rough.", "NTA not sure where her head is, but if this story is true, she's not right in the head.", "NTA\n\n\nYour sister didn't like the harsh truth, but it was the truth. And pandering to her delusions clearly wasn't helping. 3 kids in and whose to say she would ever stop that behaviour? NTA. She needs to grow up and do better for her kids.", "NTA, she doesn't have any idea of what to do in a relationship.  Parents are coddling her, she will end up with more children and alone.", "She's upset cause she knows it's true. She needed a shot of reality. That being said. Now is the time to support her and try to get her into therapy to see why she keeps doing this", "Omg! Sooo NTA! Poor kids! Are your parents delusional?", "Nta she has now three times attempted to \u201cbaby trap\u201d three different men only to fail miserably and not a single time did she show any concern for the children she intentionally created. Im also going to take a very safe guess here and day that she lied about contraception to all three men.\n\n\nShe created this very fucked up situation for these kids in a poor attempt to essentially extort multiple men", "NTA, your sister could have destroyed two life's, a marriage and some kids(if married older man has some) upbringing all because she foolishly thinks the best way to get a man to stay is to baby trap them.", "NTA. Your sister is insane, she keeps doing the exact same thing and expecting different results.", "ESH. \n\n>Genuinely sick of hearing her bullshit, I told her that the men aren\u2019t the problem, and the reason her kids don\u2019t have a father is because of her and her shitty choice\n\nYou're TA for this.  The men are *also* the problem.  Unless and until the world runs out of condoms men are able to control the situation too.  Men know the risks and undertake them.  \n\nYour sister is also an AH for attempting to trap men with a baby.  But I feel sorry for her in a way.  It's a lot to raise 2 kids alone and it'll be hard to find a good man who wants to help raise two kids he didn't father when there are other women her age that don't come with kids.", "NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA She tried to baby trap 3 guys and force them into something they definitely didn't want. She got pregnant on purpose the first time cause she wanted a relationship to level up to a marriage. Your sister is crazy, stupid, and irresponsible. To have kid after kid with every guy she has met and not even consider protection on purpose? She is already ruining the lives of these poor kids by being a shit person/mom.  \n\nShe's bringing kids into the world without thinking about them. She only wants a father figure. If she just tried to be patient and be safe and reasonable, I bet she would be married and having a good life right now with the first guy with only 1 or 2 kids. She could've had that instead of dropping a pregnancy and court marriage on him so young WTF.", "NTA\nYour sister is trying to baby trap rich men and failing.\nShe\u2019s gonna pop out a litter.", "INFO: How did all three men escaped child support?", "NTA, your sister is mental lmao", "NTA\n\nThe truth hurts.\nMaybe it could have been delivered less aggressively, but maybe aggressive will help to avoid a baby #4", "YTA - BUT you also aren\u2019t wrong.\n\nSometimes we just have to be the asshole, and accept that it was what was needed in that situation. \n\nShe\u2019s tried to baby-trap 3 dudes, and goes all shocked pikachu when it fails.\n\nI\u2019m guessing your parents enable her behavior, and her poor kids are the one\u2019s that truly pay the cost of her poor decisions.", "NTA should've told her to keep her legs closed before constantly getting knocked up", "NTA.
