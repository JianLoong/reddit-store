He moved out when my kiddo was turning 16. Even though we\u2019d agreed to split 50/50 time, my kiddo refused to stay there for various reasons. They text but hardly see each other. \n\nThere are consequences for being mean yo your kids. \n\n\nIf ex won\u2019t do counseling/set it up, how much does he really want a relationship?\n\n\nLet your kiddo have some say. Being bullied by a parent is not ok.", "NTA. Your son is old enough to form an educated opinion and it sounds like you supported a relationship with his father until he confided in you that it is abusive and he no longer wants to be abused.\n\nWhat your son said about why he wants his dad to change is heartbreaking and very telling. Make sure he knows you are safe for him in the future by supporting his wishes today.", "NTA, you know the context and your son better than anyone. Do what aligns with your son's deeper needs.\n\nIf custody is limited then is there anything stopping your son from visiting his dad as a free choice? It could actually be healthy for their relationship if any visits are optional and your son can come and go as he feels the need.", "NTA - maybe this is my own personal bias showing through (been NC with my own father for almost 5 years now), but I don't think a man who treats his son this way, specifically mocking and disregarding mental health issues and learning disabilities, is ever going to take any sort of counseling seriously.  Even if you could get him in the door, I highly doubt things would improve at all; in fact, in many cases abusers use language they pick up in therapy to gaslight their victims even more, so you may wind up making things worse trying to facilitate a reconciliation.  Amending the custody agreement so your son has as little contact with his father as possible sounds like the best option to me.", "NTA. Custody arrangements should be made in the best interests of the child. Your child is now old enough to have a reasoned opinion on where his best interests lie. You should believe him and support him in exercising his free will.", "If this is what your son wants then YWNBTA. His dad is abusive and the fact that he tears him down then pretends like nothing happened is a good sign that he is no where near being in a position to change and end his abusive ways. Abusing your son likely helps him feel better about himself and like a more powerful man.\n\n> But my son says he doesn\u2019t want dad to change because he fears losing custody\u2026he wants him to change because treating him (my son) with respect is the right thing to do.\n\nThat's totally understandable, but an abusive man is always gonna do what's best for them without care or consideration for how others feel.\n\n> My ex will absolutely think I am the asshole if I assist my teen in this endeavor. And I wonder if that might be true.\n\nIf he's an abusive asshole, he will definitely find a reason to be the victim of and find a way to blame you...but try not to let that impact you since he's the one who is okay with abusing his son. It sucks, but that's how abusive people operate. The important thing is the health and wellbeing of your son.\n\nFamily therapy would be a good idea because if his dad was committed to it then it could improve their relationship and lead to healing, but his dad would actually have to do the work. He might just want the power he currently has without the responsibility that should come with it.", " NTA - it is your son choice, only do it if he want to", "NTA. You're protecting the mental health of your child.\n\nDad needs to get *his* mental health in order then man up and apologize to his son.", "Absolutely NTA!

I would definitely pursue the therapy option first as others have said.

You may want to join in so as to gain some helpful tips on supporting your son effectively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf Dad refuses to go to therapy and flakes out, pursue the lawyer option for your son.  But make sure it is clear that the lawyer is for your son and does what's best for him.  Not you and what you desire.  That can get you in a lot of legal hot water.  I wish you the best of luck!", "NTA. Your son is old enough to make these types of decisions for himself and if he would like to use the minimal rights afforded to him as a minor, you are more than allowed to help him through that process. In fact I would say it\u2019s your responsibility to do so as you have already tried to help him foster a relationship and it obviously hasn\u2019t worked despite your best wishes", "NTA- pretty sure the son was fed up with constant gaslighting and wants to break away from it.  \nSupport your son and best of luck.", "NTA if your son needs help getting away from dad, and there's a legal way to do it, explore what options you can.", "YWNBTA - Kids who are neurodivergent or who are having mental health issues and who are shamed by their parents have a hard time with self-esteem and functionality long after they are adults (and they're usually already having a hard time due to their issues).  Shaming a kid for a learning disability is the equivalent of a parent who mocks a their kid for having a limp, and refuses to get PT or a brace.  I differ with the people recommending family therapy first, particularly here because Dad is dragging his feet.  To be blunt, people don't change if \\*they\\* aren't the ones instigating the change.  The fact that your ex is shaming your son in the first place says a lot about his own mental state and functionality.  I don't think your son should be asked to try to negotiate with someone who is supposed to be his role model and protector, but who shames and blames him for something that is not a choice.  He should not accept abuse just because the abuser is related to him.", "listen to him. when i was that age, i wanted to change the custody agreement to see my dad less. neither of my parents cared and i didn't think i could do it on my own. now i don't talk to my dad and i respect my mom a lot less for not protecting me.", "NTA\n\nYour priority is to your son not to what your ex may think about what you are doing. Asshole or not- that's still your son and you should support him especially if he's telling you what his dad is doing is hurting him.", "Tough situation. Sounds like the dad is an asshole, but he's still the dad.  If you hire a lawyer that has a *duty to your son* even to the point of advocating things you personally don't agree with, that sounds prudent. NTA.", "Before you hire a lawyer, I think you need to help get son and dad into counseling. Worst case scenario, Dad doesn't learn from his mistakes - in which case, hire a lawyer. But I'm rooting for Son and Dad to heal and develop a better understanding of each other, so that your son continues to have his parents in his life.\n\nI don't think your post is an AITA worthy situation. It really doesn't matter whether you're an AH or not, it's your son that matters.", "NTA if you're doing what you believe is best for your son.", "INFO: Has the option of family counseling been considered here?
