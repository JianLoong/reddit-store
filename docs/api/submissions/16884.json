I think further discussions via the court may need to happen; this isn't what the co-parenting app is for and definitely feels like a boundary push.", "Reading between the lines of your post, and reading your comments, it is clear this is not a good guy. And there's obviously a reason he's not allowed to see his daughter physically, and has to co-parent through an app. With that information, it seems like these text messages are pointed. Obviously your daughter can't even read them, so that burden falls into you. He knows this, and this is him making direct contact with you in an extremely manipulative way. He knows that you stopping him texting his daughter will paint you in a bad light. I'd go back to court with this and get him to stop. You're NTA.", "Nta. Everyone who said y t a missed the fact that the messages are being sent to a 1 year old / are really meant for OP to get around the no contact order she has from court.

Perhaps until she is old enough to read, you could create an email account that he could send these messages to (in addition to the video chat and co-parenting stuff that was agreed upon).

Until then, please refrain as they are in breach of my requirement of no communication beyond parenting issues and coordination.\"", "YWNBTA, but you would be giving him exactly the reaction he is trying to provoke.

That way you\u2019re still encouraging his positive interactions with his daughter without involving you.\n\nThis could be to engage with you. It could be posturing for court to make him look like a more \u201cactive\u201d parent.

Were these innocuous things that may have made him just figure he didn't want to have to go to court so he pivoted to texts where he could ensure there wasn't anything that could be interpreted as being directed towards you or was he trying to relitigste relationship issues in the video chat/using it as an excuse to get to you?\n\nETA: Read through the discussion.  You're NTA", "YWBTA. It\u2019s harmless and it\u2019s very nice, the little things are important, he sounds like a great dad. Your child being too young to remember is irrelevant.

Sure she might not be able to read but it makes him happy and its a lot more than some fathers do.", "I'm not judging this one, but I don't think it would work either and I don't think it's a demand you can make under the current circumstances as there's no court orders prohibiting this. \n\nIt sounds like you have a dented co-parenting relationship where your ex is actively seeking a reaction from you. So to you these messages are uncomfortable.\n\nOn the other hand everything else goes through the co-parenting app as well, so it's really all your ex has to connect with his kid. \n\nDo the family members managing the video calls through the app have their own accounts in the app? And if so could they become recipients of the ex's messages and the ones to relay them to kid?", "NAH but I think this is way deeper than just the text messages.  This is more about him breaking the rules during the video chat then the text messages, in my opinion.\n\n Considering this is a court order, I would be maliciously complicate to what the order says. If there is no verbal contact allowed between you and your daughters father, then when you video chat and he asked you questions just ignore them.  If he continues, record the calls and give him three warnings and if he does not stop after 3 warning, end the call and try again the next day.  That way you have proof in court that you tried to uphold the orders but he was breaking them.\n\nIf you have the time and energy, go to court and have the order corrected to address the issue. If you start straying too far from the court order, he can hold that against you in court. If you are super compiant with the orders, he does not have a leg to stand on if it is brought to the courts.\n\nI would also keep in mind to not punish your daughter for issues you have with her father. You can theoretically ignore his messages if there is nothing in court about it. He also can't prove you did or did not say \"daddy loves you\" to your daughter. I would encourage him to say everything he needs to during the call and leave it at that.", "Would it be possible for him to send a voice note or video instead that you can just play for her?", "YWBTA \n\nIf the court is awarding him access then you need to put aside your differences , Respect that and allow him access to his child\n\nDo you really want to create more conflict by asking the father to stop sending messages showing that he cares?\n\nLots of kids don\u2019t get that privilege and if you spend the next 18 + years thinking of ways to get back at the father it\u2019s only going to hurt you in the long run\n\nBe civil and try and look at it from your child\u2019s point of view\u2026.Not your own", "Ywbta you need to focus on your own healing that way knowing that your child is loved doesn't upset you to \"I will happily go to court over this\" levels.", "YWBTA your reasons aren't good reasons to ask him to stop.

I have friends and coworkers who did or do this by text or have set up email accounts for their newborns and send them emails. No sht the kids can't read them right now, that is not the point. The point is so when your child is old enough they can look back and know that their parents always loved them and thought of them even if they couldn't be present, due to divorce or work.\n\nIf you have an issue ASK about it with the court as a mediator, but don't just tell him how to parent.

The texts are aimed at OP.\n\nBearing in mind this guy has behaved so egregiously that the courts have taken the unusual step of barring contact with OP it would be best for everyone if this nasty piece of work disappeared from his daughter\u2019s life altogether.  It is highly unlikely that he loves his daughter.  She is just a tool to him.", "It\u2019s been shown that the court stepped in for a reason and has a no contact order for the ex to not talk to the OP", "Isn\u2019t OP saying the kid can\u2019t even comprehend the text messages because she is two young to read? If that is true, then the dad sounds like a little bit of a dummy, sending texts to a kid who can\u2019t even read. I mean, it is either that or he is sending these texts to mom intentionally and not for the kids.", "The court stepped in for a reason", "[removed]", "Court order no contact for a reason", "The child cant read ffs, just like people here.", "The dad also caused harm to the op reason the court is involved .", "Reas in between the lines court involved for a reason", "She\u2019s 18 months old. He can talk to her during their video chat like ordered by the court. A good way to have a relationship with a child is to not abuse their parent fyi", "Domestic violence is a reason.", "The other replies to your comment explains my situation 100 percent. I", "At the age of your baby, the videos with his voice telling her these things are appropriate. The texts are only made to force you to tell your daughter \"Daddy says goodnight/he loves you/etc\". This is clearly a manipulation tactic.", "How can you not see the emotional manipulation here? You are daft.", "Step back and look at the situation as a whole instead of through a microscope. Having or not having child development be a priority is a false choice here.", "Not disagreeing with respect to how much children are able to absorb at young ages. But these messages started AFTER OP chose not to be available during video calls. The ex chose to use video chats to try to talk to OP, repeatedly ignoring her boundaries, rather than being focused on the child. It seems to OP that the texts are being used to try to communicate with OP under the guise that they are for the child.", "He can also use it write longer letters to her. Maybe comment on the pictures you send or tell her stories from his childhood.", "In which YWNBTA for sure.   You know this is just another game for him.", "She can\u2019t read, but she can understand. 1.5 year olds know what \u201cI love you\u201d means.", "That was the goal! I'm glad it worked. I hope things get less stressful for you and your little one soon.", "Thank you for your input. You\u2019re correct and I can see I should have written something to clarify. I don\u2019t know how but I\u2019ll think about it.", "You don\u2019t need to read out every single message word for word. Simply casually mention in passing that \u2018dad say hi. dad says he loves you\u2019. \n\nLook up the Grey Rock Method and use that method with these messages. Completely shut yourself off from them, which I know is so much easier to say than do. \n\nI wish you all the best and lots of luck going forwards.", "Violating rules and triggering? And he's not supposed to have contact with you?  Just a guess, but is it something like this \ud83e\udd3c?  Um... No rules cage match \"wrestling\"?\n\nEither way, NTA, your daughter is too young to read,  and if I'm reading between the lines correctly, these \"nice messages\" are aimed **at you,**  through your daughter...?", "Even with the missing information, this struck me as an abusive ex partner trying to force you to interact with him. \n\nI think the people who are calling you the AH don't understand the dynamics of abuse, and how something like this is a threat with him essentially saying, \"I can and will contact you whenever I want, and you can't stop me.\" \n\nI think the email for your daughter is a good idea: respond to all attempts to talk directly to your daughter with \"Please contact her only through the designated email, which I let her access regularly. This app should only be for discussion regarding her welfare and co-parenting logistics.\" You can then access it every week or so depending on your spoons, smd your daughter can read and respond to any messages she finds interesting (i.e. none).\n\nAnd then when he keeps contacting you through the app, go and take his messages to the police and tell them he's harassing you despite your attempts to tell him to stop and giving him an alternative means of messaging his daughter. And then it will be terribly convenient for you that his attempts at harassment are encrypted and date stamped and basically unimpeachable evidence that because he's dumb enough to do it through the app.", "Exactly, this is very much part of the DV power and control wheel. He isn't sending to child but, mom.", "Now that I see some context in the comments I agree!", "I mean if I were the father I would 100% be expecting OP to be reading these texts to my child when I send them. A lot of people are trying to put a lot of issues on someone when it could very simply be him wanting to make sure that every morning his child hears that daddy loves them and to have a good day.", "Listen I\u2019ve been in a d.v relationship definitely go change the order that\u2019s scary almost like he\u2019s trying to gain control", "Is there a way to have him record a one or two second video that you can play directly for her?", "Hi OP, I apologise, I\u2019m really sorry for my comment about him being a great dad.", "I think you might want to add clarification to the post with information like this. It can totally be vague but I don\u2019t think people realize why you have full custody and why this is court ordered. \n\nAs someone who had parents who were divorced and had court ordered visitations, I could read between the lines, but a lot of people might not be able to.", "If that information is relevant then you need to add it to the post. People here aren't mind readers so they will respond on the information given, which is that he sends good morning-messages to his child though the communication app you have specifically for contact with (and about) the child.", "Get a second phone just for that reason and hand it to the family members and stop notifications make it clear that you ain\u2019t gonna be reading it by letting him know that there\u2019s a second phone and that you won\u2019t see that phone", "op, you might want to edit your post and mention there\u2019s a history there. You don\u2019t have to share any personal details, but maybe say what you have said in comments to people-they are judging you without full picture of the situation which is why you are getting comments calling you controlling, etc.", "Fair enough it sounds like you need major healing. Focus on that and just remember when you post things like this we as strangers don't know your story. So from what I read it sounded controlling. You are going to go through a lot harder things. Good luck.", "That is an awful lot of assumptions you are making.", "I believe the video chats benefit my daughter, the text messages does not.

I am sorry for whatever it is you had to go through to get to the point of full custody and the limited contact between you and the father. Sending support your way", "Ding ding ding", "Thank you! This is excellent insight and advice. You\u2019re spot on with your thoughts on what my ex is. Also the advice I\u2019ve gotten of involving my lawyer, as the father would just be happy to know his messages triggers me.", "If he wants to do that then he shouldn\u2019t have treated the child\u2019s mother in such a way that the courts deemed it necessary to put a no contact order on him. It is not on his victim to have to facilitate that kind of relationship particularly when OP is doing her part in ensuring that the video calls are happening.", "I did think about adding something, but didn\u2019t know how to without breaking rules and just being unclearly written.", "Sending good morning *texts* to a 1.5-year old. He's not communicating with the child. I suspect he is deliberately sending the texts to annoy OP and doing so in a way that makes it hard for her to complain.", "I thought that having to communicate through a court-approved app and him not being allowed to speak to OP made it clear enough that this isn't any old divorce situation.", "I can\u2019t do so without breaking AITA rules. And honestly, I am not triggered by the Y-T-A votes, but I was by the great dad comment.", "I wanted to say something like that, but didn\u2019t know how to phrase it without breaking AITA rules.", "How much more context do you need other then the court has forbid him from contacting OP other then on an app, that is supposed to be used exclusively for parenting? Those apps only get used in situations where one partner is harassing the other and the app is used to monitor the conversations.", "They don\u2019t issue court orders like these for no reason.", "Yes I get you.", "This is disgusting, given the context.", "\u2764\ufe0f", "Omg, NTA.\n\nBut don't confront this with him, this has to go back to court.  He can no longer do what he wants, so he's finding a way to get at you any way he can.  (That \"I miss you, baby\" just rang loud bells in my head. Years ago, I had one that was not allowed contact, and he'd call from payphones, say that exact phrase, and hang up. Untraceable and no way to prove it.  You've got proof.)", "Yea, I also noticed the lack of logic in sending texts to a baby. Still, being illogical doesn't equal malicious, unless other information is provided so I pointed out the lack of such information.\n\nEdit: just to clarify, I absolutely believe he is doing it more to trigger her into \"over\"reacting on a seemingly benign routine, than for the benefit this relationship with the child. I wasn't disputing that at all.", "You could probably put something like \"the court ordered the co-parenting to be done exclusively through the app and he is not allowed to meet his child or contact me in any other way due to his (violent/illegal/aggressive/dangerous/harmful) behaviour during my pregnancy\""]}
