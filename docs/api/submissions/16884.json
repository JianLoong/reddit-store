This boundary was made clear during court, and I have reiterated it during the video chats when father has disregarded my boundary. \n\nDilemma:\nSince I made this change of not be present during video chats, father started sending texts in the coparenting app, ALWAYS addressed to our daughter saying: good morning / night, and things like \u201cI love you \u2764\ufe0f\u201d \u201cI miss you baby\u201d \u201cI hope you have a good day / planned activity\u201d etc.\n\nI wish to ask father to stop sending these messages, because 1) our daughter is too young to understand, read or care about them, 2) that\u2019s what the video chats are for, and 3) I am the one who has to read them, not our daughter. And honestly, 4) I feel these texts are more appropriate to send our daughter when she is old enough to read or understand, and I do not care to receive these notifications. \n\nHowever, 1) the messages are nice and 2) always addressed to our daughter at least once in each message - so I also think it could be considered an unreasonable or petty request.\n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA if I asked my child\u2019s father to keep the texting relevant to us discussing our daughter, and use the video chats with our daughter to express these \u201cnice things\u201d?", "created_utc": 1683719743, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13doec3/wibta_if_i_asked_my_childs_father_to_stop_sending/", "score": 398, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think further discussions via the court may need to happen; this isn't what the co-parenting app is for and definitely feels like a boundary push.", "Reading between the lines of your post, and reading your comments, it is clear this is not a good guy. And there's obviously a reason he's not allowed to see his daughter physically, and has to co-parent through an app. With that information, it seems like these text messages are pointed. Obviously your daughter can't even read them, so that burden falls into you. He knows this, and this is him making direct contact with you in an extremely manipulative way. He knows that you stopping him texting his daughter will paint you in a bad light. I'd go back to court with this and get him to stop. You're NTA.", "Nta. Everyone who said y t a missed the fact that the messages are being sent to a 1 year old / are really meant for OP to get around the no contact order she has from court.

Until then, please refrain as they are in breach of my requirement of no communication beyond parenting issues and coordination.\"", "YWNBTA, but you would be giving him exactly the reaction he is trying to provoke.

That way you\u2019re still encouraging his positive interactions with his daughter without involving you.\n\nThis could be to engage with you. It could be posturing for court to make him look like a more \u201cactive\u201d parent.

Were these innocuous things that may have made him just figure he didn't want to have to go to court so he pivoted to texts where he could ensure there wasn't anything that could be interpreted as being directed towards you or was he trying to relitigste relationship issues in the video chat/using it as an excuse to get to you?\n\nETA: Read through the discussion.

Sure she might not be able to read but it makes him happy and its a lot more than some fathers do.", "I'm not judging this one, but I don't think it would work either and I don't think it's a demand you can make under the current circumstances as there's no court orders prohibiting this. \n\nIt sounds like you have a dented co-parenting relationship where your ex is actively seeking a reaction from you. So to you these messages are uncomfortable.\n\nOn the other hand everything else goes through the co-parenting app as well, so it's really all your ex has to connect with his kid. \n\nDo the family members managing the video calls through the app have their own accounts in the app? And if so could they become recipients of the ex's messages and the ones to relay them to kid?", "NAH but I think this is way deeper than just the text messages.  This is more about him breaking the rules during the video chat then the text messages, in my opinion.\n\n Considering this is a court order, I would be maliciously complicate to what the order says. If there is no verbal contact allowed between you and your daughters father, then when you video chat and he asked you questions just ignore them.  If he continues, record the calls and give him three warnings and if he does not stop after 3 warning, end the call and try again the next day.  That way you have proof in court that you tried to uphold the orders but he was breaking them.\n\nIf you have the time and energy, go to court and have the order corrected to address the issue. If you start straying too far from the court order, he can hold that against you in court. If you are super compiant with the orders, he does not have a leg to stand on if it is brought to the courts.\n\nI would also keep in mind to not punish your daughter for issues you have with her father. You can theoretically ignore his messages if there is nothing in court about it. He also can't prove you did or did not say \"daddy loves you\" to your daughter. I would encourage him to say everything he needs to during the call and leave it at that.", "Would it be possible for him to send a voice note or video instead that you can just play for her?", "YWBTA \n\nIf the court is awarding him access then you need to put aside your differences , Respect that and allow him access to his child\n\nDo you really want to create more conflict by asking the father to stop sending messages showing that he cares?\n\nLots of kids don\u2019t get that privilege and if you spend the next 18 + years thinking of ways to get back at the father it\u2019s only going to hurt you in the long run\n\nBe civil and try and look at it from your child\u2019s point of view\u2026.Not your own", "Ywbta you need to focus on your own healing that way knowing that your child is loved doesn't upset you to \"I will happily go to court over this\" levels.", "YWBTA your reasons aren't good reasons to ask him to stop.

I have friends and coworkers who did or do this by text or have set up email accounts for their newborns and send them emails. No sht the kids can't read them right now, that is not the point. The point is so when your child is old enough they can look back and know that their parents always loved them and thought of them even if they couldn't be present, due to divorce or work.\n\nIf you have an issue ASK about it with the court as a mediator, but don't just tell him how to parent.
