I honestly do love her to bits she\u2019s like family to me.\n\nI got my first ever car a few weeks ago. I love it, I finally feel a step closer to being independent. Occasionally I will pick up my friends or bf and we\u2019ll go out to eat or something like that.\n\nMy problem is my friend she\u2019s honestly kind of useless. She doesn\u2019t work, doesn\u2019t have her license etc. She\u2019s been asking me for a the last couple of weeks now if she can borrow my car. \n\nNow I\u2019ll be honest here and say she CANNOT drive. She\u2019s a horrible driver. I\u2019ve been in the car with her a few times and not once have I not feared for my life. She\u2019s been in multiple hit and runs, she\u2019s almost ran over a pedestrian at a pedestrian crossing, she speeds absolutely everywhere, she doesn\u2019t know basic road rules, can\u2019t manoeuvre the car safely etc. I think you guys get it by now she is terrible.\n\nI\u2019ve told her multiple times she can\u2019t borrow my car because I\u2019m working and need it to get from A to B. She keeps saying she\u2019ll be really careful and she only needs it at night every now and then (I know it\u2019s so she can see her sneaky links) but I told her the job I have requires me to be able to go whenever they call me. \n\nI use this as my excuse but it\u2019s also true. Now I don\u2019t trust her driving in the day let alone at night and I don\u2019t want to be the person getting in trouble if she gets in a crash or whatever. Since she has no license(too lazy to get one), definitely no insurance, and simply can\u2019t drive. \n\nI\u2019ve mentioned this to my parents and bf and they all think I need to tell her to get her own car if that\u2019s what she wants to do, which I agree with 100%. However I know when I tell her she\u2019ll definitely call me an asshole and say that she\u2019d do the same for me if I was in her situation.\n\nSo WIBTA?", "created_utc": 1686528914, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1479v2f/wibta_for_not_letting_my_friend_use_my_car/", "score": 161, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Add to this if she doesn't have a driver's license if and when she hits someone or gets pulled over you can be introuble.\n\nDo not let her use your car under any circumstances", "NTA\n\nHonestly, you shouldn't need to ask anyone this question.\n\nIf she doesn't have her license, she can't legally drive - period, why would you even consider lending your car to a person that can't legally drive and that you know is a horrible driver?\n\nIf you knowingly loan your car to a person that can't legally drive you're facing huge potential liability and your insurance will make every effort to not pay for anything that happens.\n\nShe's an asshole for bugging you about it and don't even consider doing it.", "NTA. Your friend doesn\u2019t know how drive nor does she have a license and that\u2019s already enough reason for her to not drive your car. You\u2019d be at liability if she does something bad while driving your car and she needs to either get a license or have someone else drive her around.", "NTA. She needs to, at the very very least, get her license to use your car. If she were to get into an accident you, or your parents, would most likely foot the bill from the insurance agency. This isn't a \"I would do the same for you\" situation considering it's 1. Illegal to have someone borrow or drive your car without a license and 2. She doesn't have a car and (most likely) won't for a long time.", "NTA. No license: no borrowing the car. Simple. When she gets her license and demonstrates that she understands some basics of road safety etc then you can have the conversation again and see how you feel (still well in your rights to say no at that point, too). But in the meantime, if she has no license it's possibly not even legal for you to let her borrow it, and at the very least you don't want your car impounded if she gets pulled over, because we both know who will be footing that bill, and it's certainly not her.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve no obligation to lend your car to her. Just\u2026\u2026say\u2026\u2026no!", "NTA\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have a license?  Absolutely no way should she should be driving ANY car without a license.\n\nAnd when she gets in an accident in YOUR car with no license?  Your insurance isn\u2019t gonna pay for that.", "NTA. Sneaky links lol. You are not obligated to let someone use their car when they've caused multiple hit and runs. Period. She'd do the same for you? Well, she should because you're a great drive. Completely different scenario", "NTA at all. She doesn't have a license, job, and is a shitty driver. Even if she doesn't wreck your car, what if she gets pulled over without a license? How's she gonna afford to get your car out of impound? Or what if she wrecks it? What if she gets in an accident and injures or (god forbid..) kills another human being with your car? \n\nRemind her of the consequences and tell her to grow tf up if she lashes out at you for saying no. Set firm boundaries and don't let her manipulate you. You don't need an excuse to not let her borrow your car..\n\nTell her to get a bike or a 49cc scooter or something. Or walk lol.", "NTA, but honestly, you may want to re-evaluate your relationship over the next few years. The \"kind of useless... doesn\u2019t work, doesn\u2019t have her license etc\" seems more acceptable right now because she is 19 (though reckless driving and driving without a license aren't great at any age). Meanwhile, it sounds like you're making progress to being independent. I'm not necessarily saying you need to dump her as a friend now, but you may grow apart and that's okay.\n\nAnd for all that is good and holy, do not let her drive your car under any circumstances.", "NTA\n\nIf she has no license, then her driving would be illegal.\n\nAnd if she is caught, you knowingly gave your car to someone you know cannot legally drive.\n\nGiving the car would be AH to her, as she would be an unsafe driver.  It would be AH to everyone - riding in a car, cyclists, pedestrians, kids playing on front lawns - whom she happens to cross paths with. \n\nAnd you'd be an accessory to her crime. If she's caught, wrecks the car, or hurts or kills someone, I doubt she'd hesitate to throw her under the table to protect herself or get a deal.", "You wnbtah.    Nope.   The girl doesn\u2019t know how to drive and has no license?  What part of that does she not understand?", "NTA\n\nShe's not licensed.  Discussion over.  \n\nIn most states, an unlicensed driver is an automatic impound of the car they're driving if she gets pulled over for basically any reason (DUI checkpoint, tail light burnt out, speeding, crash, whatever).  Not to mention, you would probably become radioactive to the entire car insurance industry, raising your rates drastically if you can find an insurer at all.  And they almost definitely wouldn't cover any damage she causes while driving your car with your permission.  Heck, you might be considered a criminal accomplice (since unlicensed driving is a crime), or face administrative action against your own license.\n\nAnd that's without mentioning her record.  If she pulls another hit-and-run, with your car and your plates, she could very easily frame you for it, and even if you can win that case, it's still gonna be expensive.  Not to mention, it's just not fair to the victims of such a potential crash.\n\nHeck, she might seriously injure or even kill herself and/or her passengers.", "NTA.  She has no license, a disastrous driving record and expects to use your car.  It\u2019s a firm NO.  Do not ever let her even sit in the driving seat if your car.", "NTA She's not on your insurance, it seems she's a bad driver anyway, and it's for shady business. What else do you need to say NO! She can Uber or get her hook ups to pick her up", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't have a license?? No she should not be driving your car, even if you were okay with her driving your car.", "NTA, she doesn\u2019t have her license, and aside from that, I presume she isn\u2019t on the car insurance. So if she got pulled over or into an accident, you\u2019d be SOL for expenses and your car would be towed since she doesn\u2019t have a license.", "Story time : I loaned my 13 day old brand new, less than 100 miles on it to a friend one night, my best friend of 15 yrs at that time, and she was hit and my car was totaled. She was unaware of a suspended license and gap coverage was then no longer responsible for paying my car off, I ended up paying out of pocket close to $9k to pay off my brand new freakin car..... It destroyed my credit, and my insurance is still high because of It. She was not at fault and thankfully nobody was injured, but never let someone use your car if they can not replace it", "YTA. Discussion over. Why do you think it would be wise for an unlicensed driver to drive your car? You are the complete, inconsiderate asshole for not adhering to the rules of the road. Do not let someone without a license drive. \n\nIMPORTANT INFO: This friend does not have a license. \n\nEnd of story.

Back when I was in my 20s I and my BF would be out at a local bar and every time we left there would be someone wanting us to give them a ride home.  Usually someone we didn't know personally.
