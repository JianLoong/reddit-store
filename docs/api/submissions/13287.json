Simple salt and pepper is fine, though. Get some grinders for freshness.\n\nMashed potatoes are super easy to master, and make a great side dish for just about anything. Also, I've never met someone that looked down on boxed Mac n cheese or a zatarans boxed rice as a side.\n\nImo, veggies are usually best roasted.

I could understand the frustration if she\u2019s taking on all the cooking or having to order out. To be fair to her preparing mac-and-cheese (boxed/frozen?) and frozen veggies is closer to heating up than cooking lol.

I also wanted to teach my young adult sons how to cook without personally having to get too creative on my own because my mental capacity was low on creativity at that moment.\n\nIt\u2019s not an inexpensive option but it has paid dividends for us.  My sons (and I) have learned so many techniques; we\u2019ve learned the types of cooking we prefer and excel at; and we\u2019ve tried dishes we never would have considered on our own.  The recipes have different skill levels and are very easy to follow and the internet has always been there to back us up when we weren\u2019t completely sure about a step.

She didn't have to cook, and had someone come out of their comfort zone just to make a tasty meal.", "NTA\n\n1. She invited herself over to your place for dinner.\n2. Demanded that you cook what she wanted instead of what you already had planned.\n3. Got mad when your very first attempt at a meal wasn't restaurant quality and is now ignoring you.\n\nPersonally, I'd never invite her over for dinner again if she's going to be that picky about onion size.\n\nAnd good for you for learning to cook! You're going to have successes and failures along the way, but the important thing is to learn from them and keep going.", "I've been with my partner for nearly 22 years.\n\nOver that time, whilst cooking great meals, I've also overcooked and undercooked food, and each time he's been understanding because I've always done my best. He's always been empathetic at my frustration when I've made a mistake, and he's *never* told me what to cook and  criticised how I cooked it.\n\nYour gf was rude and unappreciative. Broccoli can be tricky, and medium to well done is a lot better than cremating it (which is what I used to do). You did your best. You were thoughtful.\n\nYour gf was demanding and, if I was dating her, I would tell her how hurtful her words are.", "You\u2019re fine! I ate pasta pretty much exclusively until I hit my mid-late 20s and started trying to branch out my cooking skills.", "Keep at it! Cooking is a lot of fun when you become more confident. Always a good feeling to have created something yourself!", ">Your gf deliberately wanted to create drama so she could act offended and sulk, leaving you in a position where you feel you owe it to her to apologize and make it up somehow.\n\nHere's a random fact that I know and am now dumping on internet strangers: this is known as a \"[double bind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bind)\" and is absolutely a way to fuck with someone's head - no matter what OP does he's wrong", "Also get a thermometer. It takes all the mystery and guesswork out of meat and candy. This upped my cooking game a lot. Thermoworks makes some great ones.\nThe most important thing to learn about cooking is don\u2019t be afraid it\u2019s just food. \n\nNTA. If this is how she usually treats you should go looking for better, you deserve better. She\u2019s got a mean streak and she just tested if you could be pushed around and you answered yes.", "Tips and advice on cooking are nice, but you should absolutely not bend over backwards to impress this woman who seems to enjoy setting you up to fail so she can be angry at you. That kind of stuff does not improve over time.", "Seriously, roasted veggies are AMAZING! You can roast cauliflower, and broccoli, I love roasted squash and eggplant...\n\nIt's one of the easiest ways of cooking.\n\nI love this recipe. I add carrots to the spuds:\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/09/pot-roast-chicken-potatoes-anchovy-lemon-rachel-roddy](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/09/pot-roast-chicken-potatoes-anchovy-lemon-rachel-roddy)\n\nDon't let your unreasonable GF put you off cooking and stretching your skills!", "Not necessarily a doormat mate. Just trying to do the right thing by people and make them happy.  Which is great! But then sometimes other people don't realise it's not ok to take advantage of your good nature. You sound like an excellent boyfriend and don't let anyone tell you differently.", "\"Damned if you do; damned if you don't.\"", "Heads they win, tails you lose"]}
