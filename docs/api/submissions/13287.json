If my husband talked to me the way your girl did, I probably would have told him to fuck off and never ask me to cook again.

Simple salt and pepper is fine, though. Get some grinders for freshness.\n\nMashed potatoes are super easy to master, and make a great side dish for just about anything. Also, I've never met someone that looked down on boxed Mac n cheese or a zatarans boxed rice as a side.\n\nImo, veggies are usually best roasted. Toss veggies of choice (broccoli, asparagus, green beans) in olive oil with salt n pepper, put in 9x9 or 9x13 at 425 for 30ish minutes or until they are your preferred level of toasted/crispy. Experiment with additional seasonings and/or lemon or lime juice when comfortable.\n\nIt's not always exciting to cook for yourself, but I've found real joy in cooking well for others.

Just knowing that you came to that conclusion on your own tells me you'll be just fine as you learn to cook.\n\nSteak, broccoli, and a sauce is a little advanced for a beginner. Steak and broccoli have varying levels of \"done\" depending on taste, and sauces can be immensely complicated.

I could understand the frustration if she\u2019s taking on all the cooking or having to order out. To be fair to her preparing mac-and-cheese (boxed/frozen?) and frozen veggies is closer to heating up than cooking lol.

I\u2019m a confident cook now but I had a childhood like yours (tiny, hot kitchen, six kids, exhausted mother just wanted to get out of the kitchen as fast as possible).

I found success too, with a comprehensive cookbook - \u201cThe Joy of Cooking,\u201d was my go-to.\n\nI chose a meal delivery program because I was stagnating in the kitchen, cooking the same four or five dishes over and over and was uninspired to try new things.  I also wanted to teach my young adult sons how to cook without personally having to get too creative on my own because my mental capacity was low on creativity at that moment.\n\nIt\u2019s not an inexpensive option but it has paid dividends for us.  My sons (and I) have learned so many techniques; we\u2019ve learned the types of cooking we prefer and excel at; and we\u2019ve tried dishes we never would have considered on our own.  The recipes have different skill levels and are very easy to follow and the internet has always been there to back us up when we weren\u2019t completely sure about a step.

You can tell her that you'll only cook meals for her that you've had a chance to get comfortable making, and she can accept that or she can do the cooking since your early efforts aren't up to her standards.\n\nTo be honest, I'd probably just break up with her  \n\n- She's inconsiderate of your time or plans\n (She just informs you at the last minute that she's coming over (\n\n- She demands you cook for her rather than asking and blows through your hesitation\n\n- She then changes your menu that you're cooking for yourself\n\n- She demands you cook something you've never made before and criticizes you for not getting it perfect.\n\nIt sounds more like she's using you and is potentially controlling and emotionally abusive.\n\nYou deserve a partner who respects you and appreciates your efforts.\n\nA good girlfriend might have called and said \"Hey Babe, I had a really rough day.  I know it's last minute, but would you mind if I came over for the evening?  I could use a hug and a meal with someone I love.\"\n\nWhen they found out what you were making they would have either said, \"That's great!

I pretty much lived on scrambled eggs and whatever I could put in the toaster or microwave while I was in college, but I realized this was a pretty big shortcoming for me, so I've been working to improve it."]}
