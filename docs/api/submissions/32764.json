For me it was so worth it, no more throat hurting afterwards, and I stopped snoring too.", "My wife is a licensed, certified emergency medical technician, licensed both by the state of Wisconsin and through the federal government and can be deployed through FEMA, should the need arise. I think she is more than able to tell when someone has apnea, both awake and asleep, as that's kinda her job", "She already said she physically can't move it and her husband refuses to. Because, you know, he insists on tormenting her.", "Like, feel free to buy sleepohones or sleep buds. God forbid you don\u2019t passively aggressively torture your partner at 3 am.", "My dad snores SO loud and I've questioned how my mom can take it. She's used to it and it does have a soothing affect for her. But they've been married 37 years so...I don't think I could stand it but she definitely can!", "This is true but it doesn\u2019t negate the fact that her own husband is tormenting the shit out of her even when she isn\u2019t sleeping in the same room with him. So if she moves the chair is he still going to be an ah?", "This is judging off her other comments. Idc if I\u2019ll get downvoted. She\u2019s lazy and always blaming others, wants to be the victim, doesn\u2019t want to find a solution for said issue. exactly the same thing I went through lol this 100% sounds like an overweight person, sry if that hurts ur feelings", "About 6 lbs 3 oz lol", "It\u2019s kinda\u2026not her job? EMT and sleep disorder specialist don\u2019t have a lot of overlap, afaik.  And it\u2019s generally bad practice to diagnose family.", "My husband is also a licensed, certified emergency medical technician, with both our state and the federal government. But he can't diagnose shit because he's an EMT, not a doctor. \n\nAlso, did you know you can become an EMT with a 6 week online course?", "It\u2019s an EMT\u2019s job to diagnose apnea? Huh", "But an emergency medical technician isn\u2019t a sleep specialist and even a sleep specialist can\u2019t tell from observation alone. A sleep study requires diagnostic equipment to determine if someone has sleep apnea. And not just one piece of equipment measuring one thing, they measure your heart rate, breathing patterns, brain activity, body movements and blood oxygen levels. These things are all required for a proper assessment of your sleep. I\u2019m sorry but your wife\u2019s impressive medical credentials do not mean she can monitor your brain activity by observation alone. \n\nAnd most people have at least some apnea events, like up to 5 an hour is considered \u201cnormal\u201d and will give you a negative diagnosis, even though it can actually still be causing detrimental symptoms. So it\u2019s not about checking off \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d for sleep apnea, it\u2019s actually about measuring if your apnea events are severe enough to require treatment.\n\nYour defensiveness here makes me think you have a strong aversion to the suggestion that you could have sleep apnea, which is common. Theres a lot of stigma and stereotypes associated with it, though as someone who was diagnosed when I was a young skinny female, I know first hand how inaccurate those stereotypes are. I certainly didn\u2019t think I could possibly have it. \n\nBut hey, if you feel like you\u2019re getting great sleep and your health is good, then great, don\u2019t worry about it. But enlarged tonsils are super common among sleep apnea sufferers and snoring is usually a strong indication of sleep apnea. And leaving sleep apnea untreated is TERRIBLE for your overall health so I will always suggest a proper sleep study for anyone.", "Dude ??? Me either. \n\nShe\u2019s sleeping in a recliner in the same room? I\u2019d be annoyed as heck with my partner.", "yta", "She also already said she doesn't **want** to move rooms and changes her answers as she gets questioned", "There will be no energy to fix to the husband problem - whether divorce or otherwise - when she's too exhausted to function. That chair could be moved in a day or two. She can figure out the rest of it after she's had the rest she needs.", "\"Sry if that hurts your feelings\" is One of the most infuriating sentences to me ngl", "If your husband is refusing to go to counselling, refusing to help move a recliner to a different room and who won't respect your sleep time, perhaps it's time to re-evaluate your living conditions and/or your relationship. Yes it sucks you wake him up with snoring, but if you're telling the truth about trying everything and relying on him to let you know if they work or not, then it's awful he's purposefully waking you up and not doing anything to help.\n\nGood luck in your endeavors OP and I hope that it all works out for both of you.", "I laughed too hard at this", "[removed]", "Regular saline nasal rinses and a humidifier work wonders for chronic sinus infections.", "See now, I spelled it out because shes not just an EMT lmao. She can recognize apnea because she's the one who has to manage it on the back of an ambulance. Besides, what do you do that qualifies on what anyone else could recognize and treat? She's worked in Emergency Rooms, patient rounds, and has been able to accurately identify AND treat apnea, at least according to a certified MD/DO. Need I say more?", "Also, can I please put out a PSA that I never said she diagnosed me with it?", "I'm well aware, BUT you are not an EMT, that would qualify you for a EMR position, which has less ability compared to an EMT. She qualifies for up to critical care paramedic, and she hasn't diagnosed me with any \"shit.\" Her job is to not only recognize, but treat it if that's what she believes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's sorta like if you see somebody collapse on the ground, and you can't find a pulse, you immediately think to start CPR, but you're not diagnosing it. Can you see how the argument you make looks to myself? I'm genuinely serious", "See now, I'm not becoming defensive regarding anything. And you explaining like i'm 5 when that's not what I asked does frustrate me. See my second most recent post above. BOTH of my parents sleep apnea, and from my time spent in the hospital as an inpatient, it has never even been suggested by the nurses or doctors that I have that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me remind you - the comment I replied to was to get a second study, and I said enlarged tonsils can also cause snoring.", "I don\u2019t know how true that is. When first asked by commenters to move her recliner, OP replied that she doesn\u2019t want to move rooms, and that she moved her husband\u2019s stuff to the office with the air mattress to make him sleep there. Later she started replying that her husband doesn\u2019t want to help her move the recliner.", "Oh, when I saw this, I only saw that she refused to move the recliner. So I'm changing my verdict. XD\n\nAlso you know, it's reddit, and aita. We are all judgy buttheads. :/", "you give victim blaming vibes", "EMTs do not diagnose. Your overconfidence in your wife\u2019s scope of practice is alarming and potentially dangerous.", "I\u2019m so confused. Are you talking about airway management?", "Look, I get a lot of people give emergency service people a lot of flack and im sure your wife is a great EMT, but even then, my partner is a Paramedic, and from his own experience, neither he or she can diagnose sleep apnea as it's not their scope of practice, there's certainly signs and symptoms they may notice but again, they CANNOT diagnose it which means they can't rule it out for you, plus, there's nothing wrong with getting it checked.", "Honestly from reading your other responses I\u2019m not sure you totally understand what sleep apnea even *is*.\n\nLike what do you mean your wife has \u201ctreated\u201d it? Like she wrote a prescription for a CPAP machine? \n\nIt\u2019s also not something you have to \u201cmanage in the back of an ambulance\u201d. You don\u2019t suffocate and die from sleep apnea. It\u2019s not something that comes up during an emergency situation. \n\nIt\u2019s also not something that doctors or nurses would necessarily notice while you\u2019re in a patient in a hospital. Like that was my whole point I was explaining to you, that it\u2019s not something that\u2019s always observable even to a medical professional. I was also a patient in a hospital several times before I was diagnosed. But I didn\u2019t snore or visibly or audibly stop breathing, so they had to reason to suspect it. I also went to my doctor with classic sleep apnea symptoms and it didn\u2019t occur to him to send me for a sleep study until after a year of ruling out every other possible explanation because most doctors don\u2019t think of sleep apnea for young healthy people. Even a home sleep study missed it. It takes a proper full sleep study to actually rule out sleep apnea. \n\nI\u2019m sorry to explain it to you like you\u2019re five but you do seem to be confusing sleep apnea with other respiratory issues. \n\nEnlarged tonsils *can* cause snoring, because they can cause sleep apnea. They are restricting your airway when you\u2019re asleep, causing snoring and very possibly sleep apnea. \n\nSo your advice to OP that a second sleep study isn\u2019t needed is simply bad advice and based on faulty logic you seem to be clinging to.", "Same, Here I am with downvotes for saying to look at OP's replies. I didn't put a verdict or downvote anyone else \ud83d\ude12.", "how? i feel like it\u2019s reasonable to say that her sleep is the most pressing issue since sleep is extremely important to one\u2019s health and that, once she has actually been able to have some rest, she can then move on to the much greater issue of rethinking her marriage. /gen /nm", "Whuh? I presented an idea for a solution that someone in the depths of exhaustion (as well as used to isolation) might not consider. This is advice. This is not victim blaming. Should I have coddled and cooed a bit more?", "Then why the fuck won't her husband help move the recliner?", "Do I have to spell it out that she's not an EMT? And do you realize that Emergency Medical Technician can refer to anyone from an EMR through a Flight Nurse/Doctor? Obviously if she thought it were a problem, she would make me go to the hospital. She's made me go for the minimalist of things, so let me tell you that when she has been right, she's been right. I realize not everyone could understand that, but when her job is to make sure somebody won't die, or suffocate cause they can't breathe, I think I trust the medical schooling and experience over what someone on the internet thinks. She doesn't give me any diagnoses, but she can offer guidance on that stuff", "Could you please circle back to the comment(s) you replied to and read it again? I think you might have missed a few things", "Bahaha I love how people really feel like guilt from their book of fairy tales is going to sort out someone\u2019s life. \u201cDo u really want to stand in front of doctor Zeus with your hand on cat in the hat as your witness\u201d.", "I saw where she told him to move his stuff, and then said he won\u2019t help her move the recliner. Idk but it makes sense to me, he wont move her so she tried moving him. I think this is the culmination of two very stubborn people set in their ways who are also cranky and sleep deprived.", "Definitely cooing.", "Somehow I have a feeling that someone who chose  4GodUSA as a username is going to place more weight on religious shame than they would social shame\n\n\nSometimes you have to argue with people in their own language.
