We work together to make sure that in between his sleep touchiness and our toddler that everyone gets rest so that we can be our best versions of ourselves for our relationships. There\u2019s no space \u201cMY room / MY house\u201d nonsense when you approach things together.\n\nAsk yourself what you want out of this relationship. If it\u2019s, well, a relationship\u2026 go into this conversation open.", "Don't wanna move rooms while you snore loudly, then don't complain when you get woken up by his YouTube antics.   You both seem super immature about this whole thing.", "YES", "So you have the problem, but opted to force your husband out? And you\u2019re mad he\u2019s laughing at 330 am? YTA.", "Yes.\nYOU SNORE.\nYOU ARE THE PROBLEM.\nHe's being passive aggressive, but you started it by putting the chart you sleep in in the same place he sleeps.\n\nYour attitude seems to be 'i hate that I snore so everyone else should make accommodations for me because snoring is such a struggle'... get over yourself, seriously.", "Some people need to sleep in different rooms, even if they are married... this is mutually beneficial change, you're both causing each other issues because of what? Pride? Selfishness?", "I looked through her replies, and she clearly says that she physically cannot move the recliner (which is where she sleeps, in their bedroom) and her husband refuses to move it for her. She also said that the other options \u2013 since he is refusing to sleep in a different room \u2013 are for OP to sleep on an air mattress or the couch, neither of which give her the back support she needs and both of which would leave her in significant pain. So how the hell is she an AH? She's tried every option she can, and none has worked; the only other options require her husband to stop being a huge AH long enough to work with OP instead of against *both* of their interests, but he'd rather disturb what little sleep she gets.\n\nHell, she even said she slept on the couch last night and he STILL (intentionally) woke her up early. He is actively, intentionally tormenting her and refusing to do anything \u2013 including moving her recliner to his office \u2013 that would let both of them sleep, and y'all think SHE'S an AH??\n\nThis sub is wild...\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/g5gaFU7961\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/ojX5mFm5KG", "Tell your husband that he should go with you because your marriage depends on it. \n\nIf he still refuses, then go by yourself. You need to know your options, tools to cope and whether it's worth saving.", "Sorry, I moved his clothes and toiletries to the office so he can sleep in there tonight.", "RIGHT?? Like they don't even sleep in a bed - it's a recliner - move the fucking thing into a separate room YTA", "OP would rather force her spouse to sleep on an air mattress than move their chair. Meanwhile she's getting upset about him waking her up when she is doing the same damn thing.\n\nI think this marriage should end, but because they're both petty assholes.\n\nA recliner is a lot easier to move- and find room for- than an entire bed.", "Yeah, that's kind of an AH move. Sorry. But it is. What is accomplished by you keeping the room where the bed goes unused, while he has to sleep on an air mat in the office? How does that help anything? And to just unilaterally move his stuff? Come on.", "Yeah, absolutely YTA for this. How would you have felt if he moved your things without asking? If the answer is anything along the lines of \"I'd be mad, hurt, pissed\" etc then you know EXACTLY how shitty it was.", "Move them back and move your recliner. Move your clothes and toiletries. Apologize.", "Do you really want to stand in front of a judge and swear on the Bible with God as your witness that the reason you are getting divorced is because you will not move so recliner you need to sleep in to a different room and instead expect your spouse to sleep on an air mattress?\n\nDo you want the fact that you are being this petty (You are literally going \"I won't move rooms even though I refuse to sleep in anything other than this chair - If you have a problem being woken up and not allowed to sleep because of excessive noise you should go sleep on an air mattress\") to be part of official government  record?\n\n\nBecause you're heading that way.", "Yeah ofc YTA", "grow up.", "Huh? So you'll sleep on the recliner in the bedroom, next to an unused bed? Instead of just moving to a different room and letting him use the bed?", "Why does your desire to stay in the original room more important than his, exactly? You're not more important than he is.", "Jesus, you're probably sleeping outside tonight", "Duh YTA for this", "Yes YTA for this part he is also T.A. for his revenge but you both sound like you kinda suck", "So instead of getting another sleep study bc surprise, results can change and symptoms can evolve, you move his stuff? Y\u2019all both sound insufferable oml", "Her back pain is literally a medical issue so she asked her husband for help to move it and he said no. Like that would solve this entire shitshow. Between this and the refusal to try another couples therapist it seems like hubby wants her to initiate a divorce"]}
