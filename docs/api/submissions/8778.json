Jake and his sister, \u201cSara\u201d have had a turbulent relationship with their mother, as have I. I get along fine with my FIL.\n\nSome of our issues with MIL have stemmed from her addiction to social media and the internet. She doesn\u2019t work and doesn\u2019t really have hobbies other than social media. It\u2019s caused a lot of problems. Examples include her posting photos from Jake\u2019s and my wedding that were taken by our photographer before we had the chance to while cropping out my arm tattoo in all of them, live-streaming Sara\u2019s wedding without her permission, and posting embarrassing childhood photos of Sara and Jake that she refuses to take down.\n\nJake and I live halfway across the country (U.S.) from my in-laws and only see them once or twice a year. My parents and grandparents are all dead, so my MIL and FIL are our baby\u2019s only living grandparents. \n\nNow the issue at hand: Jake and I told our friends and family before our baby was born that we would not be posting photos of our child anywhere on social media until they are old enough to give informed consent\u2014probably around 2nd or 3rd grade at least. MIL and others are on a text thread where we share baby photos with close friends and relatives only. Lo and behold, Sara texted me yesterday asking, \u201cDid you give my mom permission to post these?\u201d and sent screenshots of MIL\u2019s Facebook page with 20+ photos of our baby we\u2019d shared to the private thread. When Jake and I checked her Facebook page, we couldn\u2019t see the photos, but Sara still could, which means that MIL posted them to everyone except Jake and me. \n\nJake called her on speaker phone furious, but MIL retorted that her page is private so only her friends can see\u2026 This woman has over 2000 friends on social media, most of whom we do not know, and Jake and I have blocked a few of them for various reasons.\n\nI snapped and said that she\u2019s lost her photo privileges. I took her and FIL off the group chat. I hated doing that to FIL, but I can\u2019t trust that she won\u2019t go on his phone to steal more photos. She\u2019s only met our baby once, and I told her that she will not be allowed to take any photos the next time we\u2019re together and that she won\u2019t get another photo from us. \n\nIt\u2019s only been 24 hours and I\u2019m still fuming, and there\u2019s really no way I can think of to do this without also punishing FIL from seeing photos of his grandchild when he\u2019s done nothing wrong, which is where I think I may be the AH. Now other distant members of Jake\u2019s family (not on the photo thread\u2014they got baby photos from MIL and FIL) are blowing up my phone saying that I\u2019m trying to push his family out of his life.\n\nSo\u2026 AITA?\n\n*Update in comments*", "created_utc": 1675181286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10q2vy3/aitah_for_telling_my_motherinlaw_that_shes_lost/", "score": 1012, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's disrespectful and deceitful.", "NTA, and a word of advice?\n\n\nYour MIL didn't forget, which she may try to claim. She actively lied and committed acts of subterfuge, because her internet attention for the cUtE bAbY was more important that being able to have a relationship with said baby. \n\nScrew it. You didn't go far enough. FIL can come visit baby, under a no picture clause. MIL cannot. Full info blackout for her until she can prove through other means that she has changed her ways and is trustworthy and wants to see your CHILD, not get social media attention.\n\nTake it from someone whose grandmother only wanted to be around her for the clout with her friends...your baby will be better off for it. I knew by age 5 that my grandma didn't actually love me and only viewed me as a means to an end (Good Grandma Points with her friends). To this day, I talk to her maybe once every year, at most. I'm not missing anything from my life, and neither will your child.", "NTA, & don\u2019t feel sorry for enablers. Grandad made his choice, even if he\u2019s not happy living with it.

She didn\u2019t just forget, she intentionally removed you and your husband from seeing those posted photos. She was trying to outsmart the boundaries you put in place for the safety of your child for her own needs.", "NTA. That's a very reasonable boundary that prioritizes your child's wellbeing and you were not the least bit ambiguous about it with anyone, period. As an adult who behaved badly, now she has to face the consequences of disrespecting and violating your trust. Hold your ground on this one because it's really, really important.", "NTA.

I can't tell you how many times on a smallish (~400 ppl) discord I've seen ppl share info like the name of thier town they live in and it just boggles my mind how comfortable they are sharing that even if the community itself is great.\n\nBut yeah you MIL. Definitely crossed a line, wish you the best OP!\n\nI doubt she'll listen but it may work.\n\nAlso,", "NTA\n\nYou set a boundary and she willingly and blatantly crossed it knowing it would upset you. She blocked you from the post so you wouldn\u2019t know unless someone else told you. \n\nShe gets no photos. And in demanding she take them down- maybe try to contact a lawyer or a non emergency police line to make her? If you feel that strongly that they should be removed. \n\nAlso , you\u2019ll want to have a system in place before you see her again (if you do , I probably wouldn\u2019t seeing as she cannot respect even the simplest easiest of boundaries) like a basket at the front door for cameras / phones or something or a specific \u201cMIL babysitter\u201d to watch her like a hawk.", "NTA\n\nCan you have video calls with your FIL so that he can see his grandchild? \n\nOr maybe set up a secure photo vault with photos that only he can sign into to see with his own private password.", "NTA.

You have every right to decide what you want and don\u2019t want shared and were clear about, she has now gone behind your back posting pictures she knew you didn\u2019t want posted and tried to hide it by not making it visible to you, whilst it is unfortunate for your FIL that\u2019s just how it will have to be maybe he can talk some sense into her. Don\u2019t listen to these other family members, there is no one to blame here except MIL, if I were you I wouldn\u2019t post any pictures to any of them, they will send them to her.", "NTA. You set a reasonable boundary. She happily violated it and refused to. comply going forward. You responded with appropriate consequences.", "NTA\n\nYour child, your rules around social media. It's gross your MIL doesn't respect that. I work in Cyber Security and it baffles and scares me when I see parents post pics of their kids on social media. It's ignorant and short sighted.\n\nSorry I snorted a bit in your post around \"informed consent\" when your child can make the decision themselves, around \"2nd or 3rd grade\". While I applaud you for giving your child their own autonomy- a 7-9 year old is absolutely incapable of assessing the risk and truly understanding what it means to have their data on the internet- forever.  Unless your child is old enough to understand the dangers and horrible parts of the internet they are incapable of informed consent. But you are so awesome for thinking of that!!", "NTA, Snapchat is still a thing right? maybe hook FIL up with snapchat so you can send him images that your MIL probably isn't savy enough to snag.", "Just remember that no matter what someone says, you can look at this and say \"They posted everything anyways while purposely blocking me and my spouse because they knew I would go nuclear, like this\".\n\nYou do not trust any of them. This is your child/family.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your MIL now has the opportunity to come up with a proper way to remedy this situation and can propose any ideas to you. It's not your job to amicably solve the problem your MIL created.", "My kids are not on social media. Sometimes friends ask but we say no and that's ok, it's my kid, my decision.\nBack to the problem, she seems to have an addiction to attention, get her some counselling. NTA", "NTA for the immediate reaction to this. But you and your husband need to cool off and think long-term about the whole situation. \n\nSocial media (unfortunately in my opinion) is a horse far out of the barn at this point. It will be nearing a decade before your child can understand and consent as you're laying it out. Your plan is to not give a single photo to your in-laws, or allow them to take a photo, for the foreseeable future? That doesn't seem sustainable---and will certainly harm these relationships.\n\nYour in-laws will likely see your child in person at most a couple of times a year. At a minimum, giving them a once-a-year photo (that yes, could potentially be seen by others on social media) seems like a reasonable compromise. \"Zero online\" presence is a goal I can understand, but you might want to throw your in-laws a bone here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And, at least own that you are pushing his family out of his life...while you feel justified in doing that, you are quite literally blocking out his father and mother. My kids love seeing old baby photos with their grandparents. Your kid won't have that. You're interested in what you've projected to be their informed consent but then neglected the actual human relationships they might want.

Kindly sod off.\"", "Update: \nWow, it\u2019s been a crazy day. First, FIL isn\u2019t on social media so he didn\u2019t know she\u2019d done it. While he was sleeping today, (he often works nights) she got into his phone and tried texting us posing as him to chew us out (she did this once before years ago via email) but we realized pretty quickly that it wasn\u2019t his texting/speaking style. So we called his phone and the jig was up. FIL had to change his phone passcode so that MIL can\u2019t access it. \n\nAnyway, FIL told her to take the photos down or he\u2019s canceling an upcoming vacation they have planned. She did. He\u2019s back to getting access to the photos since he changed his passcode, but she\u2019s not, at least not for the time being. We\u2019ll have to figure out when and under what circumstances she gets back photo privileges. I honestly don\u2019t know how at this point. There are clearly a ton of things we haven\u2019t been privy to, including that she\u2019s apparently extremely depressed but won\u2019t try medication.\n\nPreviously, when she posted our wedding photos, we got her to take them down and she apologized for \u201cjumping the gun.\u201d Her reasoning for posting them herself was to crop my tattoos out of what she referred to as her \u201cfamily photos.\u201d (My tattoos are flowers in memory of my deceased parents and grandparents, FWIW.) She also took down the video of Sara\u2019s wedding after Sara asked her, and we all explained to her that there are people she\u2019s friends with on social media we\u2019re not comfortable having access to our lives (including a couple of people that we\u2019ve blocked for insidious real-life actions and behavior). Because of these talks with her, we thought that she understood and had learned her lesson, but she clearly doesn\u2019t care unless she gets caught. \n\nThe family members blowing up my phone saying we\u2019re in the wrong are MIL\u2019s 2 sisters, her mother, and a woman who\u2019s not related but extremely close, so we call her Aunt so-and-so.\n\nAccording to FIL, this is just one more problem she\u2019s had with people on social media lately. I guess she\u2019s been bullying the daughter of a friend via DMs over something, and he only found out when the friend sent him screenshots a couple of weeks ago, so it\u2019s apparently a whole thing that\u2019s come to a head. FIL is trying to get her to go to therapy and leave social media, at least for a while. Idk if she will.\n\nFWIW, anyone who thinks not putting children on social media is an unrealistic expectation, there are several parent friends of mine that do the exact same thing and have been for years. It\u2019s become a pretty common practice to wait until the child can approve of a photo of them being put up for the world to see. Usually, people just place an emoji or something over the children\u2019s\u2019 faces in photos (everyone from friends and family to teachers), which is what we have asked our friends and family to do in group photos.", "NTA.
