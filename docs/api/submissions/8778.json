Jake and his sister, \u201cSara\u201d have had a turbulent relationship with their mother, as have I. I get along fine with my FIL.\n\nSome of our issues with MIL have stemmed from her addiction to social media and the internet. She doesn\u2019t work and doesn\u2019t really have hobbies other than social media. It\u2019s caused a lot of problems. Examples include her posting photos from Jake\u2019s and my wedding that were taken by our photographer before we had the chance to while cropping out my arm tattoo in all of them, live-streaming Sara\u2019s wedding without her permission, and posting embarrassing childhood photos of Sara and Jake that she refuses to take down.\n\nJake and I live halfway across the country (U.S.) from my in-laws and only see them once or twice a year. My parents and grandparents are all dead, so my MIL and FIL are our baby\u2019s only living grandparents. \n\nNow the issue at hand: Jake and I told our friends and family before our baby was born that we would not be posting photos of our child anywhere on social media until they are old enough to give informed consent\u2014probably around 2nd or 3rd grade at least. MIL and others are on a text thread where we share baby photos with close friends and relatives only. Lo and behold, Sara texted me yesterday asking, \u201cDid you give my mom permission to post these?\u201d and sent screenshots of MIL\u2019s Facebook page with 20+ photos of our baby we\u2019d shared to the private thread. When Jake and I checked her Facebook page, we couldn\u2019t see the photos, but Sara still could, which means that MIL posted them to everyone except Jake and me. \n\nJake called her on speaker phone furious, but MIL retorted that her page is private so only her friends can see\u2026 This woman has over 2000 friends on social media, most of whom we do not know, and Jake and I have blocked a few of them for various reasons.\n\nI snapped and said that she\u2019s lost her photo privileges. I took her and FIL off the group chat. I hated doing that to FIL, but I can\u2019t trust that she won\u2019t go on his phone to steal more photos. She\u2019s only met our baby once, and I told her that she will not be allowed to take any photos the next time we\u2019re together and that she won\u2019t get another photo from us. \n\nIt\u2019s only been 24 hours and I\u2019m still fuming, and there\u2019s really no way I can think of to do this without also punishing FIL from seeing photos of his grandchild when he\u2019s done nothing wrong, which is where I think I may be the AH. Now other distant members of Jake\u2019s family (not on the photo thread\u2014they got baby photos from MIL and FIL) are blowing up my phone saying that I\u2019m trying to push his family out of his life.\n\nSo\u2026 AITA?", "created_utc": 1675181286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10q2vy3/aitah_for_telling_my_motherinlaw_that_shes_lost/", "score": 531, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She actively lied and committed acts of subterfuge, because her internet attention for the cUtE bAbY was more important that being able to have a relationship with said baby. \n\nScrew it. You didn't go far enough. FIL can come visit baby, under a no picture clause. MIL cannot. Full info blackout for her until she can prove through other means that she has changed her ways and is trustworthy and wants to see your CHILD, not get social media attention.\n\nTake it from someone whose grandmother only wanted to be around her for the clout with her friends...your baby will be better off for it. I knew by age 5 that my grandma didn't actually love me and only viewed me as a means to an end (Good Grandma Points with her friends). To this day, I talk to her maybe once every year, at most.

She was trying to outsmart the boundaries you put in place for the safety of your child for her own needs.", "NTA. That's a very reasonable boundary that prioritizes your child's wellbeing and you were not the least bit ambiguous about it with anyone, period.

I can't tell you how many times on a smallish (~400 ppl) discord I've seen ppl share info like the name of thier town they live in and it just boggles my mind how comfortable they are sharing that even if the community itself is great.\n\nBut yeah you MIL. Definitely crossed a line, wish you the best OP!\n\nI doubt she'll listen but it may work.\n\nAlso,", "NTA\n\nYou set a boundary and she willingly and blatantly crossed it knowing it would upset you.

If you feel that strongly that they should be removed. \n\nAlso , you\u2019ll want to have a system in place before you see her again (if you do , I probably wouldn\u2019t seeing as she cannot respect even the simplest easiest of boundaries) like a basket at the front door for cameras / phones or something or a specific \u201cMIL babysitter\u201d to watch her like a hawk.", "NTA\n\nCan you have video calls with your FIL so that he can see his grandchild? \n\nOr maybe set up a secure photo vault with photos that only he can sign into to see with his own private password.", "NTA.

Don\u2019t listen to these other family members, there is no one to blame here except MIL, if I were you I wouldn\u2019t post any pictures to any of them, they will send them to her.", "NTA. You set a reasonable boundary. She happily violated it and refused to. comply going forward. You responded with appropriate consequences.", "NTA\n\nYour child, your rules around social media. It's gross your MIL doesn't respect that. I work in Cyber Security and it baffles and scares me when I see parents post pics of their kids on social media. It's ignorant and short sighted.\n\nSorry I snorted a bit in your post around \"informed consent\" when your child can make the decision themselves, around \"2nd or 3rd grade\". While I applaud you for giving your child their own autonomy- a 7-9 year old is absolutely incapable of assessing the risk and truly understanding what it means to have their data on the internet- forever.  Unless your child is old enough to understand the dangers and horrible parts of the internet they are incapable of informed consent. But you are so awesome for thinking of that!!", "NTA, Snapchat is still a thing right? maybe hook FIL up with snapchat so you can send him images that your MIL probably isn't savy enough to snag.", "Just remember that no matter what someone says, you can look at this and say \"They posted everything anyways while purposely blocking me and my spouse because they knew I would go nuclear, like this\".\n\nYou do not trust any of them. This is your child/family.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your MIL now has the opportunity to come up with a proper way to remedy this situation and can propose any ideas to you. It's not your job to amicably solve the problem your MIL created.", "My kids are not on social media. Sometimes friends ask but we say no and that's ok, it's my kid, my decision.\nBack to the problem, she seems to have an addiction to attention, get her some counselling. NTA", "NTA for the immediate reaction to this. But you and your husband need to cool off and think long-term about the whole situation. \n\nSocial media (unfortunately in my opinion) is a horse far out of the barn at this point. It will be nearing a decade before your child can understand and consent as you're laying it out. Your plan is to not give a single photo to your in-laws, or allow them to take a photo, for the foreseeable future? That doesn't seem sustainable---and will certainly harm these relationships.\n\nYour in-laws will likely see your child in person at most a couple of times a year. At a minimum, giving them a once-a-year photo (that yes, could potentially be seen by others on social media) seems like a reasonable compromise. \"Zero online\" presence is a goal I can understand, but you might want to throw your in-laws a bone here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can\u2019t even send him pictures of my kids because they\u2019re instantly on Facebook. I don\u2019t post pics of my kids ever until they\u2019re old enough to consent. Boomers and Facebook have been such a destructive combination globally.", "Snapchat would also be good for this purpose.", "But then in approximately 7-9 years completely respect the child's wishes, right? If in 2nd grade they decide they want to live with their grandmother and take daily photoshoots, that is a choice that needs to be respected?", "I was going to suggest this.  That way if they're \"saved\" OP will know who can and can't be trusted.", ">And shit down anyone who is bothering you.\n\nI love this typo.", "Hey! I\u2019m a Boomer and I think Facebook is the most insidious invention ever created! I wish people would stop dumping on people my age it\u2019s not as if we have some kind of hive mind or something. Would you like it if we just started ragging on all the millennials and GenXYZers and said oh those millennials they all look, act, dress the same way? So just stop it please. Or I\u2019m going to go all TickToxic on you all \ud83d\ude09", "Have you tried sending him stock photos of kids that sort of look like your kids to see if he'll post them?", "Yeah this is where OP should recruit a cousin or other sympathetic relative to report the post or at least send OP the link so they can report it.", "I think when she comes you should check her for a phone then SuperGlue her hands to her sides. She doesn\u2019t sound the least bit trustworthy\ud83d\ude09", "Grandpa needs Snapchat. Pictures disappear after a set amount of time you choose. So then he can see them, but Grandma can't get them.", "Lol. Oops. Oh well, I'll leave it.", "Well the thing is, that has been happening to millennials for years before the whole Boomer thing took hold", "Is this a parody account?", "Eh screen recording is now a thing. All you have to do is turn it on before watching", "Yeah, that was happening to Gen X long before social media even existed, when hardly anyone even knew what the internet was. I expect it\u2019s universal. Every generation is scorned by the ones above and below them.", "Oh I don\u2019t know I\u2019ve been hearing Ok boomer for a long long time. I try to  never disparage younger generations unless I get attacked first. Millennials are basically the children of my peers and I know how I was treated by my elders. I do however get the Ok Boomer crap all the time and I do retaliate when it happens and I\u2019m pretty tired of it. The only thing I can say and you all should realize you are going to get it from your kids and they are going to get it from THEIR kids so there is some satisfaction in that. But really enough\ud83d\ude44It\u2019s boring already."]}
