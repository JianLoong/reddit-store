She got so drunk she was cuddling up to my friend the whole time. they spent the whole night practically attached to each other.", "I know everyone\u2019s different but its a wedding and she dressed completely inappropriately. \n\nI Admit I did get angry at my friend over it, but it was more so the fact she just brushed it off and called her MIL hot.

Sounds like she looks up to her MIL. Good for her.", "She borrowed the dress, which I assume also means all the other ladies were dressed similarly. Is this reaction because she\u2019s older and wearing revealing clothing?", "I'm a bisexual female. I call all my female friends hot. My boyfriend knows this. He likes that I have healthy friendships with other women. \n\nSounds to me like you just need to get the stick out of your ass tbh, you're wayyyy to concerned about who is disrespectful to who when these are not even your relationships.

Also uh she's allowed to compliment other people, it doesn't meant anything towards her husband.", ">I just found it weird that she made vows to her husband yet calls his mother hot. \n\nWhat do their vows have to do with anything?

Your friend, who is the BRIDE had no problems with it so you had no right to voice any opinion. If and when you get married you can have a say.", "She brushed it off because it didn't matter to her.

It's her body.", "I know it wasn\u2019t the traditional wedding as my friend only wears black no matter the occasion, her husbands really flamboyant so the pink suit wasn\u2019t a shock.

I just think their relationship is inappropriate since she\u2019s now married. \n\nWhen we were at the bachelorette party my friend made a \u201cjoke\u201d about her MILs boobs were bigger than hers and looked better in her dress than when she wears it ,she just laughed it off saying it was worth the 5k while wiggling them around.", "Not really, the rest of us were just dressed casually in jeans and a nice top. It was only my friend and her MIL in skimpy dresses", "For someone so concerned about these people you sure sound judgy AF. They sound like they looked amazing and celebrated themselves. Which is all that matters. \n\nWhy are you harshing on their happiness?", "I\u2019m so confused as to why you are so outraged by this enough to write a post about it? The bride was happy, groom was happy, MIL was happy and wedding went off without a hitch. You keep saying she is a friend but are you actually talking about a friend? You sound incredibly judgmental and honestly your friend came to you and only wanted you to say \u201c beautiful wedding! I\u2019m so sad I missed it!\u201d Instead you gave her critique she didn\u2019t ask for and now it sounds like she\u2019s taking a break from a toxic friendship. Good for her", "Info: what are you attempting to accomplish by being obnoxious and judgmental about this?

It\u2019s not your wedding and doesn\u2019t effect you in any way. The bride and groom didn\u2019t care. So why are you making such a big deal over something that it none of your business?", "So?

She's probably been debating doing it for a while.", "No kidding! She's insufferable.", "I asked the OP why she has a problem with any of this stuff but I doubt she'll reply. I'm always slightly surprised when people get this bent out of shape about something that has nothing to do with them, is harming noone, and even the person they're trying to \"protect\" or \"educate\" doesn't agree with them and doesn't care about their opinion."]}
