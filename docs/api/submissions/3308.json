Be a better friend.", "Sounds like you\u2019re mad the MIL is hot and has cleavage to show lol", "Go away troll!", "YTA. It really isn't any if your business.", "Troll", "Yta. You are not the wedding attire or cleavage police. It's inappropriate of you to judge the mil for her outfit. All you're doing is causing a rift between you and you friend. Furthermore your comments could have caused a rift between your friend and her new mil. Thank goodness she had the sense to ignore your rude comment. Her relationship with her mil is more important than your opinion of her mil wardrobe choices.", "YTA. \n\nYou need therapy to figure out both why you care so much and why you can\u2019t see how inappropriate this behavior is.", "YTA and a judgmental prude.  Mind your business.", "YTA. So you called her up and gave your UNSOLICITED opinion, and when your friend tried to politely stop the conversation, you kept on about it. You do know you can see something on social media that you don\u2019t personally like and you can just move on, as impacts you life zero percent.", "YTA. If the bride and groom didn\u2019t have a problem with it, it is not a problem.", "YTA because it\u2019s not your wedding and it\u2019s not your business to comment that. If it was a concern then your friend would\u2019ve handled it. And even if you don\u2019t think they would\u2019ve it\u2019s still not your place to try to be an enforcer of their wedding (of which you didn\u2019t even go to btw) when they never told you to be that. You simply overstepped your boundaries as a friend.", "YTA and a massive one, your text was just rude and none of your business. You're probably jealous that she was there with your friend taking fun pics and you weren't. \n\nAlso I'm sorry but no excuse for not attending your best friend's wedding. I'd have done everything to be there.", "YTA\n\nPeople like you disgust me. \n\nWhat someone wore to a wedding that you didn't attend is absolutely none of your business.\n\nStop trying to police other people's styles.\nStop acting like 50 year old women need to cover up in shame and wear tarps and mumus everywhere they go.\n\nIt sounds like your friend is a much better person than you are.\n\nEdit to add: even if you had attended the wedding, her MIL's outfit would be none of your business. You are not the fashion police!", "Is this a joke?? Why in the deep blue fuck would you care what someone else is wearing, to NOT your wedding, let alone a wedding you didn\u2019t even attend? Of course YTA and of course she\u2019s not responding to you anymore that is absurd", "YTA. Are you going to complain about Flappers next?", "YTA, prude", "YTA, Cleavage Cop!", "YTA , A.", "This sounds like something a boomer would say. Not a 26 year old. It's 2022, please stop.", "While you\u2019re an AH for sure, thank you. Your post invokes memories of my parents going to weddings looking hot, like a Hollywood couple.", "YTA\n\nIt was her wedding and she was clearly cool with it. She's under no obligation to align her opinions with yours, and you don't have the right to try and force it on her.", "YTA. It's your friends wedding. If she doesn't give a damn, why do you? It happened, and had zero effect on you.", "YTA stop trying to cause problems in ur friend's wedding. I'm glad u weren't able to attend", "YTA\n\nWho are you to not only try to dictate what someone else wears but police someone else's wedding you didn't even ATTEND\n\nNot only that but you attempted (subconsciously or not) to drive a wedge between your \"best friend\" and her MIL. You are not acting like a friend at all (plus it's pretty gross to be so petty and judgemental over cleavage)", "YTA, and you sound like loads of fun \ud83d\ude44", "Sniff sniff. What's that aroma I smell on the air? Oh yeah, its the unmistakable scent of jealousy.\n\nYTA. Clearly not the cleavage, though. ;)", "YTA. There are waaaay worse things mil\u2019s can and do, do.", "Who do you care what another grown woman wears to a wedding?\n\nYTA", "YTA. No one asked you.", "YTA I bet you wouldn't say that if she was flat chested. She has boobs get over it. Idk why people are so offended over someone else's body and please stop sexualizing boobs.", "Obviously YTA lol - you argue w the bride for not minding? So strange lol", "YTA. Stop being so judgemental.", "This reads very fake. You\u2019re just looking for YTA comments so here you go.", "You mistyped your headline. Please copy and paste this correction:\n\n**ATAH for disrespecting my friend by judging her MIL?\u201d**", "YTA her body her choice. She can wear whatever she wants. It\u2019s on you to respect that especially as a female yourself.", "YTA. It wasn\u2019t your wedding, it wasn\u2019t your MIL, meaning it was really none of your business. Once your friend responded she thought her MIL looked hot, that should have been the end of it because she obviously was not bothered by her MIL\u2019s outfit. Beyond that, as a 53-year-old woman, we\u2019re not interested in whether or not you youngins think we\u2019re acting our age.", "YTA. If your friend didn't care then why should you? You're obviously just salty you couldn't go to the wedding and that's not MILs fault.", "YTA.   Here we go again judging how someone 50 is dressing.  It was obvious the bride and MIL were having fun.  Don\u2019t see what your problem is!", "YTA. You weren\u2019t even there and it\u2019s none of your business anyway. Are you sure you aren\u2019t jealous?", "YTA.\n\nThe caption if \"Pamela Anderson\" that your friend posted, in her own words, is enough of a clue that she's 100% fine with who her MIL is as a person, all the way down to how she dresses. There was absolutely no reason for you to bring it up at all.", "And she didn\u2019t even go to the wedding!! Like please keep your opinion to yourself. YTA", "Right? Joan Rivers has been dead for years, there's no need to resurrect her.  OP, YTA.", "Judgy McJudgy's can't keep their opinions to themseleves.\n\nOP a piece of advice: \"las nalgas y las opiniones s\u00f3lo se dan cuando se piden\".", "The only way she should be crawling back to the friend is with her phone open to all these folks telling her she's the A H. Not one person supported OP! There's a lesson there.", "Idk man... she reeks of body insecurity, low self esteem, and jealousy.", "NEVER. That woman has aged amazingly and I for one am not standing in her way from getting more amazing a day at a time", "\"But she's 50!\"  \nOP should get a life. YTA.", "The disrespect! Get thee to a nunnery", "Normally, I'd ask for proof, but then the OP might get upset and insist you take it down!", "I was always under the impression that if you still got it flaunt it. If you\u2019re still looking hot at 50, flaunt it. That\u2019s a good thing. Haters gonna hate but ff em", "Right! I'm about to be 47 and most of my tops are scoopneck, v-neck, or something similar. They're not big but they're perky lol", "I don\u2019t have a fabulous one yet, but will once I get my whole body lift and implants and you best believe those bad boys will be on display", "She doesn\u2019t want the pictures down, she wants her friend to hate the MIL just as much as she hates her, cause i think she is resentful for seeing her friend have a great time without her\u2026", "I just checked- I am 55, my tits are still amazing! I hope I don\u2019t disappoint OP by continuing to exist.", "\ud83d\ude02", "Ding ding! I\u2019m betting:\n\n* the MIL is much more conventionally attractive than OP, and that pisses OP off\n\n* OP was upset that BFF is \u201cleaving her\u201d for marriage;  \n\n  \u2014 BFF disagreeing with OP about MIL\u2019s \u201cinappropriateness\u201d was another indication of BFF \u201cslipping away\u201d from OP, hence OP\u2019s overreaction and \u201cdigging in\u201d about it; and \n \n  \u2014 that she likes her MIL too is just a bridge too far. The LEAST bff could have done was hate and be hated by MIL so that OP has something to feel smug and superior to BFF about.\n\nYTA"]}
