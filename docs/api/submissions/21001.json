Earlier this year my dad decided to stop his cancer treatment and passed away. There is only 1 brother still alive and his son Ricky thinks I am the AH. It was myself (35f), my sister Hannah (31f), and Ricky who were bffs. Our Gma died and Ricky's family broke up and he moved away. Gma's farm sat empty for 20 yrs. We still used it for family reunions. My family always stayed in the house because my parents played host. Also the other brothers did not really help with repairing the house. Ricky's dad is an alcoholic who has severely damaged the property several times. My dad was always the one to repair the place. \n\nMy dad bought out brothers to be sole owner of the farm. In order for Ricky's dad to sell, my dad agreed to sign a first right of refusal stating that if he should ever sell or transfer the farm that Ricky was to be notified first. When dad got sick myself, husband and son moved to the farm so that we would work on fixing the place while he did chemo. Plans changed when dad died. In his will he left the farm to Hannah and I. Hannah and I have agreed to keep it so we can continue family reunions. Hannah doesn't want to live in the country so we agreed I will keep living here.\n\nRicky called to talk about my dad's scattering of ashes which will be on the farm. Ricky asked how long I plan on living here. I said however long I need to. Ricky asked if mom had inherited the farm since per state law where I am the spouse inherits unless otherwise stated. I said no, dad left the farm to us kids. Ricky said \"I don't know if you know this but your dad signed a right of refusal. I have the right to buy back the farm before it is transferred to you.\" The tone of his voice to me was condescending/threatening. I told him that dad had told me, and that his paper is useless because my dad died and it doesn't apply to inheritance. It says the heirs can choose to honor it if we so choose which Hannah and I will not. He asked questions like when is the deed being recorded, who is dad's attorney, when are taxes due, etc. I gave vague answers. \n\nLater Hannah and I heard through family that he is pissed and feels my dad swindled him. His dad had to tell him it's not an us vs them thing and I haven't banned him from visiting the farm. I've just stepped up to take care of the place. He has stopped talking to me and has tried to go around me to Hannah. Hannah also knows what he said to me and has seen online chats were he has stated that Hannah is the weakest link because she's an addict. Hannah has been clean for 8 years now. Ricky has also said that I may live there but it's HIS home. He's never lived there. He lived next door until he was 14.  Some family members think I should keep the peace and make him part owner. Some family are on my side. But did I handle it wrong?

It's like getting married to Ricky. Never become part owners with someone who you wouldn't want to be essentially married to. That's not how to keep the peace, that's how to shatter your peace  lforever. I'd sooner give the entire property to a \"Ricky\" than give one part ownership.

If he had enough money for a lawyer, he'd be suing you already to block the title transfer. Nah, I really think he's just blowing smoke. I doubt your lawyer will ever have to do more than perhaps write a stern letter. Ricky has no clue how expensive it is to go to court. No lawyer is going to take him on a contingency fee basis once they see the sale contract. So he would need gobs of money upfront to make even a weak attempt at fight this. I really wouldn't worry.

I live in a small town of 1500 people, most of them are family. The farm across the road was my great uncle's and he had so many children that eventually it fell apart and burned down one day. All that is there now is a partly burned falling down house and too many heirs arguing over what to do with it. My dad wanted to avoid that for my grandma's house.

The grandparents died, the house went to their kids, one of whom bought out the others.  The house now belongs to only that one family now.\n\nThis isn't a case where some relative takes care of a dilapidated family estate and then claims it by right of swear equity.  They literally paid American dollars to be the only family on the deed.\n\nThe agreement was a right to let Ricky buy the property if it's ever to be sold or transferred.

The police may force a restraining order on him that he is not allowed within 500 ft of your property as a precaution. Plus, if he does do something stupid, you already will have it documented with authorities.

Unless they specified that it wouldn\u2019t, of course it would. I\u2019m saying the brothers were probably trying to make sure the house didn\u2019t leave the family if there was still someone who wanted it. So that if dad sells it, a family member gets first dibs before it goes to a stranger.  I\u2019m giving an opinion as to their likely intent and whether they wanted this to block the dad\u2019s kids from inheriting.

The property is barely worth $100k. It's nothing fancy. Some acreage that is rented by local farmers to grow crops, some woods, and a manufactured home built in the 70s that was falling down until we started fixing it. When he moved out of state he told me he didn't want the place. Then he got married suddenly he wants a portion. They have a house further north worth much more than this place. And he cannot afford to help Hannah and I fix it. All the brothers were paid way more than it is worth, about $70k each. And Ricky Sr put it into a bank account for Ricky Jr to use whenever he wants soooo... idk what his motives are exactly.", "Developers? No. Buying land? Yes. People are escaping a nearby state in droves.", "Hannah and I have come to suspect there is some resentment dating back many years between the brothers.

Which is how I got called the AH in place of my dad who is gone.", "Put up cameras everywhere and record to protect yourself op. NTA", "Then yeah, that's not how things work.
