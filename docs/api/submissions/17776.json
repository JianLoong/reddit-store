Honestly, it sounds like a really good idea. if you are marrying him, the son becomes a major part of your life, and I don't think it is unreasonable to want some predictability and stability in that life.\n\nYou were not rejecting your fiancee, you were simply stating to him what you want and need before you accept any proposal. And it sounds like, by making that claim, that your fiancee is trying to use guilt to force you to back down.", "NTA. That's better for the kid too.", "NTA. it\u2019s better for everyone involved, adults and children, when contingency plans are made beforehand. if you start a family without making a plan, it could cause his son to feel like a complication in his father\u2019s life, or a bunch of other possible emotional damages to any of the people involved. maybe you could try telling him that the reason you\u2019re so insistent on this is not because you\u2019re rejecting him, but because you deeply value the life you have and will have with him, and you want to do some work now to protect it from falling apart in the future because life can be messy and unpredictable. it reminds me a lot of situations i would bring to my therapist all the time in intensive outpatient, and she would always remind me that our emotions don\u2019t need to be rational to be valid, but just because they\u2019re valid doesn\u2019t make following them the right choice. proposing to someone is a big scary leap of faith, and just because you\u2019re in the right here doesn\u2019t make it unreasonable for him to be feeling this gut reaction he\u2019s feeling. try to see his side, validate why he\u2019s feeling this way yet stay true to the course of action you\u2019ve decided on.", "NAH. Getting a legal custody agreement is going to be an excellent thing for your partner and stepson, partner just isn\u2019t able to see it at the moment. You acting in his best interest should be a big green flag for him. That said, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s an asshole either because family court and custody stuff is scary as fuck- he may fear losing access to his son if the request to make things official pisses his ex off. Him explaining that he felt rejected rather than lashing out doesn\u2019t say \u201casshole\u201d either. No assholes. But hold firm on your request for everyone\u2019s good.", "NTA. You\u2019re being smart. Tell your partner that he rejected himself because you asked for something very reasonable before proceeding and he didn\u2019t do it. That\u2019s on him.", "You should have that plus a pre nup I think.  NTA.", "Info: You said when his son would visit, rather than live with you.

I don't have much to add as there are already some beautiful comments on here. Good luck. Haply for you for finding someone to spend your life with.", "NTA whatsoever. My friend was in a similar situation when she started dating her now husband. As soon as her husband\u2019s ex learned they were serious she pulled visitation. My friend married having never met her stepson. The ex then pulled some major garbage and they didn\u2019t see the boy for almost a decade. It was a complete mess.", "NTA. Get a pre-nup too", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu set a reasonable boundary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou KNOW it is never going to happen. YOu were right not to accept a proposal until he does it. YOu should consider a timeframe you are willing to to wait, and then end the relationship.", "NTA \n\nThis is very important and he should agree, this is a more of \u201cI want to marry you but some things need taken care of first.\u201d", "NTA - You are wise. If he proposes without this in place he is disrespecting you. You have been clear.  Him feeling rejected is coming from somewhere....what barriers are in the way that block him from moving forward? If he is not motivated to do this now he will not do it later, IMO.\n\nA filed parenting agreement with the courts is a must. A defined child support agreement through the state which stipulates who covers health insurance is a necessity. These clarify how the son's parents will work together, what financial commitment you and future husband need to secure and what calendar dates can you proactively plan family trips. This serves as a foundation to decide what you should be saving monthly toward the son's future: medical expenses, education (trade, college, etc). \\~ Best to you!", "NTA, a custody agreement protects everyone.  My cousin and her ex had a great co-parenting relationship until one day he decided to not return the kids.  She didn't see them for nearly 4 months and spent thousands in lawyer fees.  It's better to be safe than sorry.", "NTA. Stick to your guns honey. If he doesn\u2019t get his ducks in a row, your lives will be dictated upon by his ex. Don\u2019t do it! NTA.", "NTA for wanting a formal custody and child support  however, the underlining tone towards the child is disturbing and makes me wonder how you will treat him when you have your own biological children because it comes across as though you do not even like the kid!!", "NTA, and frankly, very pragmatic. \n\nYes BM and SO may have a cordial relationship, but often times engagement and babies from new relationships makes the ex more and more dramatic.\n\nNothing wrong with having the boundary I am not going to be engaged to a father without a court order regarding custody and financial responsibility.  There is at minimum 12 more years of obligations on your SO part. Having a court order alerts everyone of the expectations they have for each other.", "Yes, I wasn't a fan of his reaction. It made me feel like I was being made to feel guilty for something that wasn't progressed before he wanted to get engaged", "Particularly if something happens and they go from \"tense but willing to work with each other\" to \"completely acrimonious\".", "That is very very good insight, especially the feeling bit. Thanks a lot for your answer", "That is very good insight and I may not have been sensitive enough to this.", "It is different. Parents live far away from each other so my partner has him for some weekends and they share holidays. There is no pre-determined pattern at the moment.", "You might want to look into a prenup too. If he's not keen on formalising such important arrangements, you might find yourself paying for his child support, or generally being taken advantage of financially. Kudos to you for being practical about this. Too many people jump head first into marriage (because, romance) and then end up regretting it because they didn't cover their bases.", "no problem! from what little i\u2019ve heard you both seem like good people who genuinely care about what\u2019s best for each other, which is refreshing to see on this forum, and i wish you the best. i think people approach \u201cam i the bad guy here?\u201d as a debate title to be won, a justification trophy of sorts, and not a tool to help find the most suitable resolution in a conflict.", "NTA and you can also build some flexibility into the agreement. When he tells the wife he can emphasise you want to make sure that you can plan things with the eventual siblings and the boy to bond or some mushy spin to it if that helps? haha   \n\n\nFirst hurdle is getting your partner to be realistic and not throw tantrums over a perfectly reasonable boundary that you had set long before he hinted at proposal", "Well you aren't the asshole for wanting a custody arrangement in place, it makes sense, and would be good for his son to have consistency. But his son will always have to come first so nothing will ever be set in stone. You seem to want a level of certainty that isn't possible. Like maybe his son will want to drop by random weekends, you'll have to be ok with that too.", "That is a fair point. My concern is mainly financial. I'd like us to be able to plan for the future within a financial frame.", "That's definitely fair enough. If you are merging finances (and it becomes your responsibility too) you definitely need to know what child support will look like, as well as medical costs etc.\n\nAnd given your partners response you definitely shouldn't proceed until you're on the same page.", "He might be worried about potential cost increases, or lack of flexibility in the event of job loss or something.", "NAH. You can\u2019t force him to get a legal agreement but at the time, it\u2019s understandable that you want everything officially sorted out. I think you need to have another serious talk about this and if neither of you are willing to budge, it\u2019s time to move on!", "NAH but stick to your guns", "NTA. Stand your ground.", "Got married this year, with my husband doing an informal thing with his ex and child...and I said the same thing as you but I did not follow through. Ex found out we got married, and filed for change in custody to full custody and told him she was coming for my money. Long story short, NTA...we are now in a strange legal battle. Women be crazy, get sh*t legalized and on paper. All of it.", "NTA - the fact that he doesn't have a formal custody agreement in place and his visits with his child seem messy or informal at best and then his reluctance to put anything in place is, for me personally, a big red flag.  \n\nA year ago you started doing all the mental work for share future projects in terms of budgets, support and thinking thru affordability and visibility and even when you told him that you did not want to move forward until he demonstrated a level of responsibility he should be showing as a single parent - he ignored your request/boundary and tried to proceed anyways.\n\nHe's 41 years old?  And this is his behavior?  Sure you want to marry and have kids with him?  He doesn't sound very responsible or mature and his response to you was pitiful.", "NTA, you are being very reasonable.\n\nA marriage is about more than love. It\u2019s also about money and stability and lifetime of complex logistics. You are effectively entering into a business partnership, so expecting your partner to have their affairs in order is absolutely fine.", "NTA. You wish to stabilize an unstable important situation. He is clowning.", "NTA. You are being wise and he doesn't want to have a difficult conversation with his ex. He set himself up for rejection.\n\nHowever some women can and will go out of their way to be difficult too. Is she reasonable or unreasonable? Is this a matter of formalising and documenting the situation with a begrudging ex or will it require a full blown and expensive legal fight to achieve this goal? I still think you are right but people never fail to disappoint!", "NTA. Formal agreements are just good communication.", "NTA and very very wise. Do not marry him without those conditions being met with enthusiastic consent. If you force him he will resent you. If he refuses again I\u2019d bin him.", "NTA, there needs to be some type of contract with how much he pays each month and what percentage of things like medical and tuition.  Things like when visitation is, who gets what holidays.  Right now he is willing to fly by the seat of his pants, but you should not have too.", "And also...when you marry someone, your finances legally become merged with theirs. It would be deeply unwise to not formalize child support before OP legally ties herself to this man. Otherwise, the child's mother could theoretically come after OP's money too. NTA.", "He wants you to marry him, but there's a big part of \"him\" that is currently undefined, which are his obligations to his child. That includes financial obligations, time obligations, etc. It's completely understandable that you should want that defined.", "Take it from someone who married a man with a child and no legal custody order, don't marry without one. Don't move in together without one. All it takes is baby momma getting passed and threatening to take the kid away and now your husband is at her beck and call and drops everything to do whatever she says whenever she says. Vacations getting canceled because she demands he take the kid during that time but kid isn't allowed to leave the city. Plans with friends getting canceled regularly for the same reason. No holidays with my family because the kid wasn't allowed to be with my family. The constant changes in the child support amount. It's insane how bad it can get in a short amount of time. Lawyers for custody cases in mother biased states are expensive.", "I\u2019ve also heard some horror stories of cordial former couples trying to make things official, and ending up anything but cordial once conniving lawyers got involved and stirred the pot. Tread carefully.", "> This is to ensure that we are able to budget child support without it being subject to last minute changes\n\nEven a court order can be subject to change. A childs needs changes as they grow and their environment changes and thus a child support can be altered at any stage.\n\nGoing the court route could upset things not make them stable if the parents are in a good place. Getting lawyers involved will only get the mother pushing for more and more.\n\nIf anything though, a formalized parenting plan would be the better option through mediation.", "Zero sympathy for deadbeat dads who have less than 50/50 custody and whine about child support."]}
