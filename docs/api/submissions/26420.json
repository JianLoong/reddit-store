He said we could meet up after his delivery and hang out. \n\nI am always up for seeing my partner, however today I simply couldn\u2019t. I currently work two jobs, both from home. In the morning I had a heavy training session from early on, and then in the afternoon I was working my other job where I help host B2B roundtable meetings. I am from the UK and this event was US based so I would be working fairly late into the evening to suit the US timezone (my last call finished around 8.30pm). I knew it was going to be a long day and knew seeing each other would be too much for me. \n\nWhen my partner first asked about meeting a couple days ago, I explained the situation and politely declined. Over the last few days however he has continued to ask over and over multiple times, not taking no for an answer and not understanding my busy schedule. I have felt awful declining over and over, continuously apologizing about not being up for it.\n\nYesterday it even got to the point where he randomly declared he could do the delivery then stay over for the weekend. I still live with my family and it was not enough notice to have him stay over (my parents are quite old-fashioned and like to have the house in order etc before someone comes). I explained again to him it wasn\u2019t possible as it was too short notice.\n\nCut to today: My boyfriend sends me a message first thing saying \u2018Btw i\u2019m bringing spare clothes and a toothbrush in case I get a hotel or something\u2019 (really what he meant is in case he can come over). I overlooked this and told him to drive safe and have a good day. \n\nSo I\u2019m working my event job this afternoon, things are hectic and people are not turning up etc. I felt up to my eyeballs in it. At around 2.30 i then get a message from my partner saying he\u2019s parked outside and wants me to come see him \u2018on my break\u2019. During these events a break isn\u2019t really a break, we\u2019re still sorting things out and i\u2019m still needing to be at my computer organizing things in between calls. I also knew I wouldn\u2019t be done til much later on and it was a boiling hot day so didn\u2019t want to leave my partner sat pointlessly in his car for 6 more hours.\n\nSo i told him no again, I told him to head home and told him I was annoyed he hadn\u2019t listened to me and just turned up. It felt like he didn\u2019t take me or my job seriously and I explained it would be impossible for me to see him right now.\n\nHe ended up heading home disgruntled and now he\u2019s not talking to me. I was quite harsh in telling him to go but I felt frustrated that he completely hadn\u2019t listened or respected what I said.\n\nAITA for telling him to go?", "created_utc": 1694120084, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16cq62z/aita_for_refusing_to_see_my_partner_who_came_over/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then, wants to act like his feelings are hurt after you told him a copious amounts of times that you will not be able to see him??? That is absolutely ridiculous. And very manipulative if you ask me. He also assumed that your family would be okay with the impromptu visit. Which again, that is a red flag inviting himself to things he wasn\u2019t invited to.

It was hard to say no tbh, and I was quite harsh when I told him to leave in the end, I will admit I was pretty blunt in wording but also just frustrated with it all by that point >.<", "Hey thanks for the response! It has happened a couple times before to be honest over menial things, but not quite like this... I do hate the silent treatment tbh, I just want to know he's home safe for my own peace of mind too.

That's actually a good way to look at it tbh, I hadn't thought of that about someone else... I hope that tomorrow brings a fresh perspective on it from his end, today was a super hot day and obviously he did a long drive, so hoping he's just got hot and bothered and will calm down tomorrow... but we shall see.

I do definitely see what you're saying though and appreciate the reply :)", "I already know what I think about her post and why.\n\nI want to know why you think the way you do.\n\nIf you've got nothing, just admit it.", "He lives 3 hours away, if that was my boyfriend I would MAKE time.

It sounds like OP's job at the point boyfriend was around was such that she didn't have a spare second."]}
