This after her and my dad have been together literally since they were in high school!\n\nSo she decided she was going to leave my dad for this guy and of course our whole family is still stunned and not understanding this at all. I have barely spoken to her since she moved out although she has tried several times to get me to go out to dinner or visit her. To meet this dream man of hers. I told her hands down I will *never* meet this guy. In my book he\u2019s a sleaze bag . Married guy who pursued a married woman and destroyed two families in the process. I\u2019ve also told her there\u2019s is no way in hell he\u2019s coming to my wedding in October.\n\nThat of course started a fight with her because by saying that she said I was sort of saying she was sleazy too. Well, yeah, it takes two to tango as they say. So my relationship with her hasn\u2019t been the best.\n\nThen she showed up at my place yesterday unannounced. I was just hanging out with my fianc\u00e9 and doing some work in the yard. My mother shows up with this clown in the car! \n\nSo she came around to my back yard and said hi. I said hi and asked her what she was doing there. She said she wanted to see me and my fianc\u00e9 since we hadn\u2019t seen her in a while. I told her that was fine but that man was *not* welcome in my house and never would be. So he could sit in the car while my mother visited.\n\nOf course another argument followed with my mom saying she thought we could deal with this like adults and I reminded her that this guy is the reason all three of her kids don\u2019t come around her. And she\u2019s got to accept that more than likely none of us are ever going to want to be around him so stop trying to force it.\n\nLike I have lost a lot of respect for my mom but I still love her. I don\u2019t understand how you get bored with the person you supposedly love so much. This is what she said she still loves my dad but she got bored in their relationship and doesn\u2019t love him in that way anymore. Like I can\u2019t look at my fianc\u00e9 and imagine not loving her anymore. I think cheaters all have these lame excuses. \n\nAnyway she stayed for maybe five minutes before she said I was acting like a spoiled brat and I said that fine but he\u2019s not coming in. So she said her goodbyes and left.

Your mother knows how you feel. She shouldn't have tried to force him on you, especially unannounced.", "NTA...You can love someone from a distance my guy. Your boundaries were established. She has repeatedly tested them. She then gets all pissy to find that they haven't changed. This is the behavior of a child.", "NTA, Your mother has every right to leave your dad, and you have every right to be upset at that decision, and to especially be upset that she was cheating on your dad. You dont owe her anything, and you certainly shouldnt have to put up with her new boyfriend.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t owe them anything. \n\nShe made a choice, to cheat on and leave her husband. (Even if nothing physical happened until she separated from her husband, she still had an emotional affair, which is a sleazy thing to do, to use your words)\n\nIf she was unhappy with her husband, the respectful and grown-up thing to do would be to end it. The childish and disrespectful thing to do is to have an affair, emotional or physical, and blow up your family. If she didn\u2019t want to be married to your dad anymore, that is 100% her choice, and she has every right to leave him. What she doesn\u2019t have the right to do is cheat on him and then expect all of her kids to be fine with it.\n\n\nYou and your siblings have made your boundaries very clear.\n\nI would suggest making sure there are people at your wedding, aware that her boyfriend is not welcome, because after the stunt she pulled showing up to your house, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she tried to bring him to the wedding.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nI cannot imagine how anyone, especially adult children, can possibly deal with this bomb that was just thrown into the middle of your family.\n\nQuite how your mother expected you to be happy to meet her AP and do so happily is beyond me. Exceeded only by the hubris of the man himself who felt it was the right time to insert himself into your lives.\n\nPeople fall out of love and marriages end. As miserable as it is for those involved, especially children, you cannot just grit your teeth and grind your way through the rest of your life, which may be decades, just for the sake of keeping going as a couple when (if) both are unhappy. Naturally, kids increase the complication level several fold.\n\nHowever, if you know you are not happy, leave. Have an honest discussion and just leave. Be open, honest and truthful.\n\nYour mum threw a grenade into her family and is expecting her kids to help clear up the blood and snot.\n\nAgain, NTA", "Boundaries are a healthy way of dealing with any situation. This one undoubtedly involves many people you love and care about. In my humble opinion NO you are NTA. Boredom is an empty excuse for ending a long term marriage with or without children. Realizing that no one but your parents will ever have all of the details that factored into Moms decision, leaves the rest of us assuming so much. It could be possible to have a relationship with her someday, in the future, provided she owns up to the devastation and destruction she has caused, the ripples of which still reverberate. While Mom may appear entertained at the present, the rest of the family, extended family, close friends and associates are still processing her actions and decision whether they agree with them or not. She is in denial and is attempting to deflect her onus of this situation it seems. For you, maintaining boundaries while explaining that while you love her you are unable to accept her actions and current situation with this other man is crucial. Her choices brought about drastic changes in the way you currently view her and will interact with her in the future. It is definitely okay to let her know that it may be months and even years before you may want to actively have her in your life. \n\nHaving said all that, be mindful that she is an imperfect human. Just because she is your Mom doesn\u2019t mean she is above making idiotic decisions or pulling stupid stunts. Rule out mental illness as a factor for sure! Find it in yourself to forgive her so that bitterness and hurt don\u2019t destroy YOU in the future. Your anger will fade. Your Dad and the rest of the family will heal, especially with your continued love and support. Hope it all works out in the end and Congratulations on the upcoming wedding!", "NTA: You already made your feelings clear and she disrespected your boundaries. Also, she has no reason to act angrily toward you when you have valid reasons for not wanting to meet him. She\u2019s bullying you into a relationship.", "NTA \n\nYour house, your rules. \n\nShe didn't like the consequences of her actions, but that's life, she doesn't have to like them, but she'll have to deal with them.", "NTA", "This is all so new. You may never change your mind about meeting him or if this last for a long time you may become civil with him. Who knows at this point. Definitely NTA for having hard boundaries about your mom's affair partner. Actions have consequences.", "NTA, she chose to step out, she is in the wrong, end of story. Sorry this happened to you.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed your feelings and your boundaries. This story is so similar to my grandparents\u2026 and you sound so much like my father did. He\u2019s the one who caught his dad cheating. In the end, he regretted holding the hate for so long and missing out on so much time with his father (who cheated and married that woman) to protect his mothers feelings, even for decades after she passed. I can\u2019t say that will or won\u2019t be you. \nBut I do know nothing can change what happened and you only have control of your choices from here on out. You\u2019re well within your rights to be angry. Your mother has to deal with the consequences of her actions. That\u2019s her burden to bear. Your parent\u2019s relationship was theres to maintain. And a long term commitment takes serious hard work by both parties. Both fighting every day to love, respect, support and honor each other physically, emotionally and spiritually. I can tell you that there are absolutely days you have to wake up and CHOOSE to love your spouse. And occasionally there are days when that is hard to do. 3 kids, years of likely putting their relationship on the back burner, years of putting herself on the back burner. The fact that they\u2019re high school sweethearts actually makes it more understandable to me. There\u2019s no defending cheating but the breakdown of a relationship is rarely squarely on one set of shoulders. The other man didn\u2019t steal your Mom. She left. He\u2019s not free of guilt but he\u2019s not at all solely or even mainly responsible for the end of your parent\u2019s marriage.", "NTA.\n\nShe's a cheater who's trying to force the rest of you to accept it so \\*she\\* doesn't have to feel the sting of her own conscience.", "Of course you can get bored of being with someone.  People fall in and out of love.  She could have carried on an affair for years and done a lot of serious damage but she did the right thing and left.  It's their choice and sometimes love takes us in directions we never anticipated.  \nYou're obviously hurting but from the write up you're all adults and there isn't any kids at home to break up the family unit so to speak.\nI think it would have been worse for her to stay in a relationship she was no longer happy on.\nYou don't have to like the guy but unless he's a horrible nasty person or has done something to you he might just be a nice guy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.", "YTA, but not because you don\u2019t want to meet your mom\u2019s boyfriend.\n\nYTA for expecting your mom to stay in an unhappy marriage just to please her adult children. I sincerely hope that your marriage is happier than hers, but she and your dad were literal CHILDREN when they started dating, not even through puberty yet. They\u2019ve grown, they\u2019re changed, and they\u2019re allowed to seek out happiness as adults.", "ESH. \n\nShowing up uninvited when she knows how you feel is a bad move, and I think she got the result she should have expected and I don't think you should feel too bad about that.\n\nBut I also invite you to divest your emotions from your parents relationships. You're 27, you've got your own house, your own marriage coming up. You're gonna have plenty to be angry about and plenty of relationship to care about on your own. Your parents can figure their own stuff.\n\nCongrats on your wedding, I hope this all works out before then.", "NAH - she\u2019s an adult and so are you. She\u2019s making choices for her life and you\u2019re just not ready to accept them. It is what it is. She fell out of love with your dad - it happens. In fact, it\u2019s possible she\u2019s only stayed with him for so long out of love for her kids and, now that you\u2019re grown, is choosing to live her own life.", "YAH. In addition to being wrong, you are being abusive. Torturing your mother psychologically so she feels guilty about seeking her own happiness.\nHave you ever stopped to think that she might have been unhappy for years? But only now she allow herself to seek happiness because you are all adults?\nShe is not obligated to stay married to your father for the sake of the \"family\". She did the right thing, she didn't cheat, she didn't deceive. She said how she felt and left.\nYou are not obligated to like him, interact with him or welcome him into your home. But you are being a spoiled brat by treating your mother badly for being with him. You clearly took your father's pains. But I assure you that no woman leaves if the man who is with her values \u200b\u200bher. You, as a son, do not know the couple's history.\n\nYou should be happy that your mother is looking for her own happiness. Stop punishing her! we are free beings with desires, she has the right to not want to be married to your father anymore.", "ESH everyone is being selfish and immature. \nYour mom can't force you to meet her new man but you can't call her every name in the book and expect no repercussions.", "ESH.

She\u2019s a whole grown ass woman that made that decision herself. I know it\u2019s easier to blame someone, anyone, else because you don\u2019t want to think your mother abandoned her current life and would betray trust like that. Both your mom and this man need to take responsibility for their part in this and learn to deal with consequences. And there are ci sequences\u2026some unrepairable.
