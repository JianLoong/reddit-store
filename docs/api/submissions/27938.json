Throw away account because my husband follows my main\n\nI (34F) have been married to my husband (46M) for almost 4 years now. I have two kids from previous relationships. I have my son, Liam, (13M) and my daughter, Reagan (17F). Their father left me a long time ago, when Liam was 5, so I've been raising them alone until I met my husband, James, almost 5 years ago. My ex-husband left us because he preferred his mistress more than his own two kids and wife. This left my children heart broken, and he isn't active in their lives anymore. Times where tough for me and my family back then, but James showed me love and compassion I barely felt from my own family. James has been a great dad, and has shown us that he really cares for me and my kids, until recently.\n\nBoth of my kids are in extracurriculars, because I feel like it's really important for kids to have sports, because it helps them connect and bond with kids around their age, who also like doing the same sport. But recently, I've noticed that my husband, James, has stopped attending Liam's hockey games, but still goes to my daughter's football games (she's a cheer leader and does sideline cheer for her high school, but also does competitive cheer on the side with her friends). Everytime in the past couple of weeks that I've tried to get James to come to Liam's hockey games, he'd go \"Oh I can't today, such and such popped up at work\" or \"Ah I'm not feeling good today, just take Liam and I'll see if I'm up to it today\". He has weekends off, and Liam's games are on Sunday, if that matters.\n\nBut Liam's games are super important to him, and I can tell that he's kinda distracted when James isn't there, and when he's in the car and I hop into drive, he'll say something like \"Hey where's James? He not coming today\", and I can tell on his face that he's bummed out when he hears that James isn't gonna come. \n\nWhen it's time for Reagan's games, however, James is always ready, and is even early. When I get home from work, on Friday's, he'll be ready for the game, and have the car packed with snacks, bring a water bottle for Reagan, and have stadium chairs packed in the car, and blankets for the game. (My state gets super cold at night).\n\nThis is even evident around the house. I'll wake up some mornings, and Reagan will ask James to put on some extra bacon for her, or make an extra piece of toast for her, and he'll do it no problem. But if Liam asked him the same thing, he'd groan, or go; \"Can't you just do it yourself?\". \n\nIf Reagan asked James to drive her somewhere, he'll be fine with it, but when Liam asks him, he goes \"Alright, but remember, I'm not an uber\".\n\nI talked to my sister about my husband not being at Liam's games and she told me I was being an asshole for expecting him to be everywhere my kids are, and that he's their step-dad, and can only do so much. \n\nI feel like I'm at a cross roads, and I may be overthinking it, AITA?", "created_utc": 1696082282, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16w7jd9/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_my_son_is/", "score": 747, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your son needs it to learn how to be a caring, kind man, also healthy relationship with authority/parental figure is good for his future decision making. \n\nalso, I'm absolutely not accusing your Husband of anything, just generally this type of favouritism is kind of creepy, regardless of gender.", "Nta\n\nBut your husband is lusting after underaged girls.

Tell him you have noticed a widening discrepancy in the way he treats the kids, and ask him if there is a conflict between him and Liam that you're not aware of.  (I don't think there is, but it's better to cover all the bases.). Suggest if he does not have the bandwidth for two events every weekend, then he should alternate between the kids, because they both need him and Liam has noticed his absence.\n\nSome people are commenting on James' preference for a nearly adult teenage girl, but if he was used to supporting both kids then I would concentrate on why he seems to have stopped caring for Liam. Which isn't to say it's not a concern, but the change in behavior is why you wrote.", "Why is he so interested in a 17 year old girl? Or is he interested in the other cheerleaders?\nHow does he behave around her? Does he buy her expensive stuff?\nDoes she have a boyfriend?

Something is up.", "My uncle sexual abused me for years growing up, and despite years of parents' talking about boundaries and inappropriate touch and telling them if it happened, I didn't say anything or even recognize it as bad. In fact, I thought of it as good, like I was special. \n\nUnfortunately, research has shown that stepdads have higher rates of sexually abusing their stepkids- in particular daughters. My brother was actually the one to say something. I tried hard to deny it, but it eventually came out. My parents were devastated. \n\nI'm not sure asking your daughter or your husband will result in truthful answers, but also, if they do, what are you willing to do to keep the kids safe? Do you have a financial safety net? Counseling support? \n\nI'm not sure how serious you are, but if you're genuinely concerned (I am), I would be considering making my partner do a full disclosure and polygraph test (with no more than 3 questions on the actual test). The risk is just too high, and it's amazing how well these things can stay hidden. People often feel betrayed by the other parent for not seeing the signs or not doing enough to intervene, and that's largely because (usually male) partners who are abusing the kids are very good at manipulation of everyone involved. \n\nSorry you're going through this.", "Nta\n\nBut your husband is lusting after underaged girls. Take precautions.", "OP, take it from someone who experienced something very very similar, this is bad.\n\nIs there a chance that he may just have distanced himself because he feels it's time that Liam starts to be more independent? Maybe. Is there a chance that he's just closer to Reagan? Also maybe.\n\nHis behaviour has changed drastically from what you have said, and that drastic a change, that quickly, is not good.\n\nSomething is going on here. You need to keep a close eye on what is happening and speak to your children. Reagan may lash out, so you might want to think about how you want to phrase your questions, but don't ignore this, and don't wait.\n\nGrooming a child can happen in a matter of minutes. Not days or months or years as many people think. 4 minutes. That's how quickly a predator can get into a child's head and groom them. \n\nYour daughter is almost legal, but still a child. She has questions and is starting to discover herself in a different way. He could know that and maybe take advantage. And she could maybe be flattered by the attention and want more. As in want more preference, not anything else. \n\nHe is neglecting your son suddenly, and plying your daughter with attention and positive reinforcement, and giving her whatever she wants. This is not good. Take action as soon as possible. Because this can end quite badly if you don't.\n\nAlso, NTA", "N-T-A for being concerned. But YTA for even asking this instead of doing something. Dude, your seeing direct favoritism here and your not doing shit about it. You need to sit down with him and put a stop to this, figure out what's going on here and fix it.\n\nI'd also maybe personally be a little worried about something going on between your daughter and your husband. Not to scare you or anything, but it's worth a very brief considering just in case. The most common people to groom children are close family members, friends, and step parents. Reagen is at the perfect age for that kind of thing to happen. So before considering anything else very briefly see if there are any red flags there for that, just as basic safety.\n\nBut really, you need to be putting your foot down on the mistreatment of Liam. He'll notice this and it could impact him forever. Your sister is also an asshole.", "NTA.  There are very blatantly red flags going off. But be careful of HOW you talk Reagan, in case anything inappropriate is ALREADY happening, if it is and you come off as suspicious then they will definitely lie and take measures cover their tracks. Sorry to say it like that but this kinda crap is popping up on the news more and more lately.

Not to mention she's 17 and he goes above and beyond for her, but your 13 year old son just gets told to \"do it yourself.\" He's still a kid, and not that your daughter isn't, but it's such a weird dynamic.\n\nI don't want to accuse him of anything, but I would definitely talk to him and ask *why.* I would also sit down with your daughter and have a conversation about how she feels about him, or if it hurts her that James is so dismissive of Liam.\n\nAlso very hurtful that James is so unwilling to go to Liam's games when he obviously wants him there.

Throw away account because my husband follows my main\n\nI (34F) have been married to my husband (46M) for almost 4 years now. I have two kids from previous relationships. I have my son, Liam, (13M) and my daughter, Reagan (17F). Their father left me a long time ago, when Liam was 5, so I've been raising them alone until I met my husband, James, almost 5 years ago. My ex-husband left us because he preferred his mistress more than his own two kids and wife. This left my children heart broken, and he isn't active in their lives anymore. Times where tough for me and my family back then, but James showed me love and compassion I barely felt from my own family. James has been a great dad, and has shown us that he really cares for me and my kids, until recently.\n\nBoth of my kids are in extracurriculars, because I feel like it's really important for kids to have sports, because it helps them connect and bond with kids around their age, who also like doing the same sport. But recently, I've noticed that my husband, James, has stopped attending Liam's hockey games, but still goes to my daughter's football games (she's a cheer leader and does sideline cheer for her high school, but also does competitive cheer on the side with her friends). Everytime in the past couple of weeks that I've tried to get James to come to Liam's hockey games, he'd go \"Oh I can't today, such and such popped up at work\" or \"Ah I'm not feeling good today, just take Liam and I'll see if I'm up to it today\". He has weekends off, and Liam's games are on Sunday, if that matters.\n\nBut Liam's games are super important to him, and I can tell that he's kinda distracted when James isn't there, and when he's in the car and I hop into drive, he'll say something like \"Hey where's James? He not coming today\", and I can tell on his face that he's bummed out when he hears that James isn't gonna come. \n\nWhen it's time for Reagan's games, however, James is always ready, and is even early. When I get home from work, on Friday's, he'll be ready for the game, and have the car packed with snacks, bring a water bottle for Reagan, and have stadium chairs packed in the car, and blankets for the game. (My state gets super cold at night).\n\nThis is even evident around the house. I'll wake up some mornings, and Reagan will ask James to put on some extra bacon for her, or make an extra piece of toast for her, and he'll do it no problem. But if Liam asked him the same thing, he'd groan, or go; \"Can't you just do it yourself?\". \n\nIf Reagan asked James to drive her somewhere, he'll be fine with it, but when Liam asks him, he goes \"Alright, but remember, I'm not an uber\".\n\nI talked to my sister about my husband not being at Liam's games and she told me I was being an asshole for expecting him to be everywhere my kids are, and that he's their step-dad, and can only do so much. \n\nI feel like I'm at a cross roads, and I may be overthinking it, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Maybe he gets along well with other parents at the football games. Hockey is also a longer season than football, so maybe by the end of it he attends the same number of games for both. Maybe he\u2019s not getting along as well with Liam right now, only because of personalities clashing.

If your husband hasn\u2019t given you any reason to suspect him, then don\u2019t. \n\nBut it is important (especially after you confirm it\u2019s all innocent) that he understands how much his support and presence is missed by your son. Either way, your husbands actions need to change toward your son. It\u2019s not okay for your son to feel disappointed.", "I\u2019m glad, because I\u2019m sure your son is hurting about this. And that\u2019s pretty crappy of your husband. Seeing his sister get all the attention and him not being able to even ask for a ride is ridiculous.\n\nI had mentioned in another thread that maybe he\u2019s grooming her? That would be a big concern but I don\u2019t know the situation so just something To keep in the back of your mind.", "I\u2019m curious if this happens how he will react. If he freaks out about not being able to attend her event instead of seeing the fairness of attending both and agreeing then I\u2019d take that as a sign to get your kids, daughter especially, far away from him.", "Really watch his response to being banned from her games. This will be an eye opener", "OP your husband is eager and keen to watch young ladies jumping round but not watch boys playing football.  Big huge red flag here wake up he fancies your daughter.  You first need to ask her if she is comfortable round him. Is he inappropriate in any way then ban him completely watching her games. I would seriously look at your marriage because this is creepy.  Good luck", "I wouldn\u2019t give him the ultimatum. I\u2019d just ask if he plans to go or wait and see if he attends. You shouldn\u2019t have to tell him to do it or warn him of a consequence for not going. \n\nI don\u2019t want to accuse him or cause a problem in your marriage. However with the alarm bells going off, it\u2019s hard not to see it one way. \n\nSo an issue you could have, and should keep in mind, is he\u2019s building that bond with your daughter. Once you deny or ban him from being around her or going to her activities you will be giving him and in with your daughter. She may see him as a father figure, and he will play on the \u201cyour mom is trying to keep me away from you\u201d aspect. It will cause discord and possibly encourage her to go against you, and your son because he\u2019ll also play the \u201cyour mom doesn\u2019t love you like it do. She loves your brother more.\u201d If he is grooming, this is classic move. This is how they build trust and get them to hide things from you. Careful how you proceed.", "Let us know what happens", "I was going to say esh\u2026but with this particular comment I\u2019m going with TA. \n\nWhy are you punishing your daughter?\n\nI\u2019m wondering now, do you give Liam more attention and your husband sees this? So he overcompensates for you?", "Careful with this line of thought. Your husband is at fault for not paying attention to your son, but banning him from your daughter's games is also a punishment to your daughter. Considering it's just a healthy affection that your husband has for your daughter (and I really hope it is), your daughter will hate you and your son for getting step dad banned from her games. \n\nJust make sure to explain your decision properly to your daughter and also take input from her to avoid rebellion from her.", "Im a daddy's girl, and Op's situation is still extremely disturbing to me.\n\nIt goes way behind a normal father/daughter relationship of any kind.", "Except that it's not daddy's girl. It's step dad.\n\nDon't be naive. James is more than a little dodgy.", "This is a recent development, namely when puberty has done most of its work on the daughter. If this were a case of \u201cdaddy\u2019s girl\u201d, the relationship would have been evident earlier without the obvious and abrupt shift in tone.", "as I said, it may not be even a conscious thing. my dad for example is very liberal, gentle and pro-kindness if you ask him, but his upbringing with a very conservative, borderline abusive father makes him unconsciously act and react in a very harsh way. Either way - open conversation is always the best thing.", "Can I ask at what age did you get together with James. There\u2019s a significant age gap between you both as well which makes it more alarming", "Don\u2019t even go to your husband with this . Check your daughter\u2019s phone.\n\nAnd I would check with her coaches and see if she\u2019s missed any practices when your husband supposedly took her. \n\nAsk around her friends if they noticed anything.  \n\nBe prepared for your daughter to not be honest with you. Your husband could have been preying on her abandonment issues.", "check your daughters phone first", "Admittedly we only see the worst on Reddit, and this is a valid concern.  It is not the only explanation though; the man has been in their lives for 4 to 5 years now and he used to support the son.  I wouldn't blow up the family without exploring the problem first.  I think we all agree there's a problem.", "I saw that. Now, I can understand not wanting to believe it bc it's life shattering but she doesn't have a choice if she wants to protect her daughter.", "Even if it is a matter of interest, it\u2019s not about him. It\u2019s about both kids. Say it is he just likes football better than hockey? Who the f cares? You show up for BOTH kids. \n\nThe problem here is the sudden change though. From being actively involved for both to ONLY involved for one.", "Because the real answer is, he enjoys teenage girls and that answer isn\u2019t one he can really offer up to you without revealing his unhealthy interest in teenage girls.", "Yeah i guess, better he go to the football, and her to the hockey if it's necessary. Spread the load. One parent per child. \n\nWhere I am schools sort the transport and there's no need for this.", "He's waiting until she's 18 so he doesn't risk having to live under an underpass several hundred feet from a playground, school, or daycare.", "It could be this. I'm hoping it's more so that James enjoys football and it happens to coinside with her cheerleading, and can play the involved step parent card with minimal effort. Of course, this perspective ignores the rest of the behaviors, but maybe... \n\nI wonder if James goes to the cheer competitions at all, or if it's just the football games.", "I'm hoping he just prefers football to hockey, but it still wouldn't explain the favoritism at home.", "I was thinking the same thing. It's so gross.", "Tbf he could simply be more interested in going and watching a football game over hockey.. not that your concern isn't valid.", "Very American Beauty", "This is it. Whether consciously or unconsciously.", "It\u2019s honestly the eagerness that\u2019s making me feel uncomfortable. Add that to the fact he gets there early when the cheerleaders are stretching. I grew up in Texas. High school football is life there and that includes the cheerleaders. But if a man showed this much excitement for just the cheerleaders it would undoubtedly stand out.\n\nETA: your daughter may not have a clear understanding of what is and is not appropriate in a father/daughter relationship. I\u2019m saying this as someone who grew up without a father so literally no judgement. But it took me a lot longer to understand that my own desperation for a father relationship made me overlook things that were inappropriate so I didn\u2019t lose that \u201clove.\u201d", "As a mom, I agree. The fact that hes not biologically related to her daughter worries me, because as you pointed out, she's about to become a legal adult.\n\nIf I were her mom alarm Bells would be so loud I probably wouldn't be able to think straight. \n\nI'm also a self-admitted asshole when it comes to my kids. I would have sent the kids out somewhere and I would have sat him down and told him exactly how things looked. I would have made it crystal clear that if I ever found out that he was remotely interested in making a move on my daughter, it would probably be the last thing he ever did in his life.", "Thank you so much! I want to create a safe space for both of my kids, I want them to be honest with me and not hold back, no matter how hurtful the truth is.", "You described it accurately, and I feel like I am going to throw up. Not your fault, I would really like to have a word with the step-father. A conversation he would likely remember for a long time.", "That scene with Mena Suvari's character becoming the only cheerleader present and undressing herself in a fantasy in American Beauty immediately sprang to mind reading OP's post.\n\nI really hope I'm wrong, but if I'm not, this is REALLY serious. I hope OP can get to the bottom of it.\n\nNTA.", "Yep. But she might not realize.  A therapist would be better for her to talk to.", "Plus she could start interpreting her love for him as otherwise if she doesn\u2019t already. Especially if he is encouraging it and telling her they just have to wait and have to maintain discretion. It will become,\u201d you\u2019re just jealous..\u201d especially considering fatherly love is something the daughter is desperate. She doesn\u2019t know a healthy bond like that, the stepdad can easily groom her into more.", "It was the first thought most of us had.", "That is true however he is not supporting of her son. He\u2019s made that very clear. He doesn\u2019t even want to give him a ride somewhere.\n\nI am a mama bear and I will never let anyone disrespect either of my children. And I can bet that her son recognizes what\u2019s going on.", "This is horrible advice. Just show the man a thread with 90% of people accusing him of grooming his step daughter - what could POSSIBLY go wrong?\n\nBest case scenario he\u2019s not grooming her and there was a rational/innocent explanation but the relationship is dead now. Worst case he is grooming her and decides that now he\u2019s ousted to get aggressive and violent. I never want to see another post ending up like Jason in hell story (if you don\u2019t know the reference DO NOT LOOK IT UP! It is awful, there are not enough content warnings for it, multiple casualties). Shit can go batshit real fast.", "Liam is at hockey and Reagan is at gymnastics. I've been at home reading these comments while my husband is out with friends for the next 2 hours. I've been at home and I'm reading these comments, I will for sure have a conversation with my kids when they get back, and my husband will be talked to later.", "I try to give my kids equal attention, and I'm at every event. I just don't want James ignoring my son and giving all of his attention to my daughter, I just wanted it to be split equally.", "Same. At best it\u2019s hinky, at worst\u2026it\u2019s quite a bit worse than that\n\nOP, I\u2019m not a mom, and I\u2019m notoriously oblivious and even *my* alarm sirens are going off. Trust yourself", "my dad is the same way. The weird thing is that my grandpa was trying to be better for my dad because my great grandfather was the worst.

Have as much information as  possible.", "Okay, I so very much want this to just be that he likes football and not hockey.\n\nBut seriously, this did  happened to a women I know.\n\nGot married, had two daughters, got divorced, ex hubby disappears, daughters never see him. \n\nNew man shows up, they get married, the older the girls get the more time he spends one on one with them. \n\nHis \u201cfavourite\u201d turned 18, he broke up with the mom, went crying to the daughter about how horrible the mom was, cold, ignore him, bla, bla, bla.
