I was paying about 70% of the rent because I made more. I paid $1400 and he paid $600 because he was living as a student, studying full time and working part time. \n\nThen 4 months ago I was laid of and began collecting unemployment. I told him we should split things 50/50 because I now made about as much as he did on his part time job but he resisted because I have more savings because I worked. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to ask me to dip into my savings especially when we didn\u2019t have our money together at any point and most of my savings came from before we met. We argued back and forth for weeks until he agreed to a 60% 40% split which in my opinion still wasn\u2019t fair but at least we weren\u2019t arguing.\n\nAs soon as I found my job, I was suppose to start on Monday he demanded I had to switch back to the 70/30 split. I didn\u2019t even get a paycheque yet and I felt like he was just using me as bank. He doesn\u2019t own a car but most of the grocery shopping, going to friends places, dentist appointments aka anything that required a car meant he took my car. And he has never filled up gas for me. He took my car for 2 days to visit parents and gave it back to me completely empty. Because he wanted to use my car so often I wanted to add him as secondary driver on my insurance but that would have cost $70/month more which he refuses to pay and expects me to cough up because it\u2019s my car. \n\nAt this point I was ready to move out anyway but my friend\u2019s roommate was moving and my lease was ending. I told my bf I was moving out a month ago and officially moving to my friends place Oct 1. He is pissed and giving me attitude all the time so I\u2019ve been mostly at that friends place anyway and just paying the last month. My name is on the place and my landlord wanted us out anyway because she wanted to increase rents. He\u2019s pissed because he said I blindsided him but I gave him almost 2 months notice but I feel like with how he treated it he can\u2019t expect me to keep putting up with it.", "created_utc": 1694726133, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16iu6kd/aita_for_moving_out_because_my_bf_expects_me_to/", "score": 284, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
