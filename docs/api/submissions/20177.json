The kids were all hanging out on the big trampoline outside. The youngest two 5F and 9F come up from the trampoline. The youngest is crying, and they both are saying that someone (not sure who), was being mean and bullying the 5F by throwing her shoe in the bushes and saying mean and racist things.   \nTwo of the kids (Ryan and Dean both 12M), then blame my son (Sam, also 12M) of being the sole perpetrator. After a lot of back and forth between all parties, Ryan and Dean both confess to lying and being the ones who were at fault. \n\nMy oldest sister brings them over to apologize to Sam, but before they say anything, my son says, \u201cYo, me personally, I don\u2019t take that kind of disrespect.\u201d Ryan then bursts into tears. My sister thinks Sam was being antagonistic and tries to scold Sam for making Ryan cry. I stop her and tell her that Sam has every right to stand up for himself and it\u2019s a good lesson for Ryan so that maybe he\u2019ll think twice before lying and throwing people under the bus.  \nNow my sister thinks I\u2019m TA because Sam said something that made Ryan cry and I let him get away with it.

I\u2019m calling crocodile tears as a ploy to get out of trouble. \n\nYour sister should be more concerned about Ryan\u2019s actions and lies, rather than trying to turn him into a victim. NTA", "NTA. Actions have consequences, and just because you apologize doesn't mean you get out of those consequences.\n\nI'm gonna go out on a limb here and say your family are fans of Supernatural :)", "NTA\n\nThey lied and blamed him for bullying that they perpetrated. That he said this one comment on response is really not a big deal, whether Ryan started to cry or not. Maybe he finally realised what a dick he had been.\n\nNo, I don't think you should have made Sam apologise or punished your son, frankly.", "NTA - this gives \"you calling me a racist actually makes you a racist\" vibes. Your sister needs to focus more on her kid being a racist bully and less on your kid standing up for himself. I'm guessing that she's deflecting so that she doesn't have to deal with her kid's issues.", "NTA\nRyan needed to learn that right thing to do was apologize. He also learned that just because you apologize, doesn\u2019t mean the other person has to accept the apology and the actions immediately upon receipt or ever. \nYour sister needs to stop coddling him.", "NTA. You have your son\u2019s back especially when he\u2019s been targeted unfairly. This is exactly why he doesn\u2019t succumb to bullying.", "NTA. Sounds like Ryan needs therapy asap. One minute he is being a racist misogynist and the next minute he is crying and playing victim?\nI\u2019m scared to see what Ryan will try to pull as a full grown man if his parents don\u2019t do something now.", "NTA, your son was wrongfully accused and was standing up for himself and the crying child was the guilty party, unless I've misunderstood", "NTA - And good for your son!", "NTA,\n\nYour sister is letting her emotions cloud her judgement. Her kids not only accused your son of bullying but also being racist. Your son could\u2019ve said something worse to them honestly. What your son said was reasonable and honestly pretty mature. Only aholes here are your sister and her kids.", "info - is Ryan really really really sensitive?  I\"m just confused about why he would cry over that.", "NTA, it\u2019s not even out of line for your son to say that imo. I wouldn\u2019t even considerate to be rude at that point as he didn\u2019t target the other kid just made it known he does not accept that behavior towards him.", "[removed]", "Probably best just to de-escalate the situation in the moment and deal with it as you feel appropriate later on.", "NTA. Ryan's feelings are his own to manage, not your son's or anyone else's. Sam wasn't rude. He held a boundary, which is a healthy thing to do. Your sister is kind of wackadoodle to think Sam should be punished for that. I hope Ryan learns the lesson regardless of his mother's over-protection of his precious feelings.", "Most definitely NTA, you raised your kid right by teaching him not to take anyone's shit. Your sister should be busy teaching her sons about racism instead of giving you and your son a hard time, while your sons response wasn't even a personal attack unlike their comments towards the youngest kid(s). \n\nSounds like \"Cry about it and you'll get your way/get out of trouble\". Yeah nah, not a lesson I'd want to teach my kid.", "NTA. Apologies are not for making people not mad at them anymore and giving them a pass, which is why Ryan was crying, he thought he\u2019d get out of it. Especially for racist shit, wtf? Plus they need to understand just how fucked up it is to try to blame innocent people for their own wrongdoing and crimes. That shit needs to get crushed under a ton of bricks. Something tells me that sister is an enabling agent, too. But it\u2019s hard to tell, so I won\u2019t say that\u2019s a for sure thing. Maybe something for you to think about.\n\nGood for you for backing up your son. Beware of those kids, they might be growing up into shitty pieces of trash.", "NTA, Ryan was only crying because he got caught, not because he was sorry.

NTA", "NTA\n\nWhen I tell my child \"I won't give you chocolate for dinner\" and they cry, am I TA?", "NTA", "NTA. Your son didn't say anything wrong, IMO - and you sister should be more concerned about her son lying than about your son, who didn't do anything wrong. She should stop turning him into the victim & punish him so he can deal with the consequences of his actions (though of course this isn't in your control, and telling her how to parent might make you the AH, depending on how you go about it)", "This! \n\nNTA. You should have high-fived your son right in their faces. You raised your son right. Meanwhile your sister is raising a little racist. You\u2019d think she\u2019d have more shame.", "Could not have this any better!", ">Ryan\u2019s actions and lies\n\nAnd where the racism and misogyny came from, that\u2019s pretty serious shit.", ">Ha! I don't actually think I've seen a whole episode of that show. The names are all made up, just wrote whatever name came to my head first.", "I agree. And it seems it was said in a respectful way. It's not like the kid started cussing everyone out, just said I have a line and you crossed it. Which is totally fair, and actually super mature coming from a 12 year old.", "That's the gist of it.", "Like some have pointed out, Ryan will often cry to elicit a response from his mom. But yeah, I'm sure it didn't feel good being called out by my son.", "> all the YTA people here\n\nAll none of them?", "what kind of drugs are you on?", "There's not a single Y T A comment", "Let his son get yelled at for doing nothing wrong? You feel that\u2019s appropriate? Because the sister wasn\u2019t going to let it go since her precious Angel was crying crocodile tears.", "For the sake of brevity, I left out a lot of details. I am white, my husband is black. Our children (9F and 12M) are likewise mixed. The youngest (5F) is also mixed and belongs to my younger sister. \"Dean\" is Ryan's friend and not related. According to my son, Dean has used the n-word in his presence before. Ryan doesn't typically start things, but lies to cover for his friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, my older sister asked my husband to speak to Ryan and Dean about the racist thing that was said. I wasn't there, but he was very stern. They are considering other ways to get it through his head that this is not acceptable and are consulting my husband on different ways to address this. And Ryan and Dean will be taking a \"break\" from each other.", "I getcha, lol!", "It's some kind of spam bot.

They're spamming the exact same thing, word-for-word, in at least 3 other threads", "aunt brought cousin over to apologize, son refused to accept the apology and cousin started whining and aunt got mad at son, but rather than getting all tribalistic, probably just best to defuse it and force them to make peace and then talk to son in private later", "Mmmm\u2026 so what your saying is that it was your sister\u2019s son\u2019s friend who was making all the racist remarks, not her son? \n\nYeah, still not okay. But at this age tho, it\u2019s easier to manage and shift that perspective so it\u2019s great you and your husband is being hands on with helping that.

Sam doesn't have to apologize l, and Ryan is old enough to be able to accept that without bursting into tears. Sam didn't even say anything insulting or mean to actually make Ryan upset. Ryan crying bc Sam said he doesn't allow disrespect is something he and his mom need to deal with together, not something OP and Sam need to try to fix.", "I believe the racist remark was made by Dean. The bullying and lying were a combined effort by Ryan and Dean (throwing the shoe, placing blame on my son, etc.).", "yeah but OP made it worse by getting hostile", "By hostile you mean \"describe Ryan's behavior?\" Bc calling someone out for their behavior isn't being hostile, it's holding them accountable.", "For family harmony, I'd rather just make peace in the moment. \n\nGenerally, assholes are the ones that stubbornly insist on jamming their \"point\" through because they feel they're in the \"right\"", ">For family harmony, I'd rather just make peace in the moment. \n\nFor family harmony, I'd rather the bully not be a bully. Someone standing up for themselves politely is not challenging family harmony. It would have been one thing if Sam had been decided to be mean back and insult Ryan, but he didn't. Ryan cried bc he faced the consequences of his actions, which was that someone was upset with his behavior toward him. This is something he's just going to have to deal with in real life. Better to learn it from someone who's willing to treat him civilly as opposed to someone who would treat him worse. \n\n>assholes are the ones that stubbornly insist on jamming their \"point\" through because they feel they're in the \"right\"\n\nSam didn't do anything wrong, though.

Great job encouraging your son to stand up for himself!", "You are completely correct in supporting your son.  Ryan lied and said that your son said racist things and was a bully.  Those are pretty serious accusations.  Your son said that he didn't take that kind of disrespect.  This was a statement of fact, confronting Ryan with the impact of what he did in an almost understated way.  Disrespect?  Yes, what Ryan did was disrespectful, but it was also dishonest, sleazy, and a show of bad character.  \n\nYour son was under no obligation to even accept Ryan's apology, particularly if Ryan was being forced by your sister to make it.\n\nYour sister has raised a kid without the integrity you expect in a 12 year old.

Also, my other nephew (14M) was present \u2014 not playing with the kids but near by in a quasi-supervisorial role. Maybe it\u2019s the \u201cbig trampoline\u201d that bothers you, and I\u2019ve got nothing for you there. It was and remains a big trampoline.", "INFO: was the racism and bullying handled?

We are white and I\u2019ve spent the last 13 years teaching my boys to be advocates for everyone regardless of their skin/gender/religion/sexuality/ etc\u2026 I could never imagine a situation where I would flip blame and make excuses for anyone\u2019s discrimination, regardless if it was one of my own children.\nI am so sorry your kids had to sit and listen to that garbage.

My husband, who is black, spoke directly to both Ryan and Dean telling them in no uncertain terms that what they did was deplorable. My husband went so far as to say that if Ryan continues to tolerate racist language and abuse, Ryan is no longer welcome to call my husband \"uncle.\" This is particularly significant because all our nephews and nieces refer to him as FUNcle. They were made to apologize to 5F. My sister and my husband are having on-going conversations about other activities that Ryan will need to do.

There is are good ways to hear out a person who wants to apologize and not-so-good ways. Your son's way was not particularly good. What does \"I don't take that kind of disrespect\" mean?  It's unclear. Some people might interpret it to mean \"I'm going to get my revenge on you one day\", though I'm confident that's not what he meant.  It would have been much clearer if he'd said something like, for example, \"I hear your apology but after what you did, I can't hang out with you anymore.\"  You had an opportunity to help some young men learn how to deal with difficult situations maturely; you didn't take it.  \n\nYour sister tried to help Ryan and Dean to handle the situation maturely.  She tried to help them apologize.  Good on her.  But when the result wasn't what she expected, she overreacted, in my opinion. What your son said wasn't ideal, but I don't think it was intended to be hurtful or mean.  The fact that it made Ryan cry is irrelevant. \n\nYour son's reaction to Ryan and Dean's attempted apology is not going to teach them the lesson you think it will.  Punishing Sam isn't going to teach him the lesson that your sister wants him to learn.  After reading a few of the comments, I feel the only fully sensible person in all of this your husband, who wants to focus on providing direct education to the boys.  Perhaps all of you can take your lessons from him.", "Lol! Deserved! I\u2019m definitely not a cool kid. Gotta get my quotes straight \ud83d\ude02", "LMAO you must have grown up very sheltered."]}
