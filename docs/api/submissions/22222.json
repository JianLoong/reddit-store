The problem is she is planning to arrive less than 2 weeks after the baby is born (which will have to be by C-section so I anticipate I will be in significant pain). \n\nShe says that she wants to come to help out, but due to her disabilities could not practically hold a newborn for any period of time as her hands intermittently go numb due to spinal malformations. Walking up 3-5 steps can wind her. And she requires an assistance animal, which unusually is a large bird. \n\nMy apartment is in a very hilly area with a number of stairs around the complex with no ramp or elevator so it is not exactly a great place for her to navigate to begin with. I also have a cat who I anticipate will not get on with the bird. \n\nI tried to be subtle about saying there are a few issue, but due to her autistic traits she doesn\u2019t pick up on those well so I\u2019ve had to be more blunt and sent her a long message saying that as much as I value her friendship I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to visit. She immediately called me to tell me her bird can be birdsat and that she\u2019s fine being here for 3 weeks and is getting extra pain meds to come over with.\n\nI had to cut the conversation because I didn\u2019t want to say something wrong. \n\nWIBTA for saying \u201cPlease don\u2019t come\u201d", "created_utc": 1689327303, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zbs6s/wibta_for_bluntly_telling_my_friend_not_to_visit/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You will have just had a baby and do not want guest in your home at that time. \n\nAs much as she may want to help, it is not about her, it is about you and your baby and wanting things to go as smooth as possible.", "I think that you have to very kindly but firmly tell her no once more, that having someone visit just after your C-section won't work for you as you need the time to bond with your baby and to help your older child adjust.  So as much as you appreciate her offer, the visit will have to be postponed until you see what it's like to care for two small children.  \n\n(I can't even imagine hosting a houseguest of any sort with a small child and an infant, so I don't think that saying no can possibly be seen as a slight -- at least not rationally.)\n\nI think you're going to have to be very unequivocal here; this won't work.  Don't agree to this.  it's not a reasonable thing for you to do.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Its absolutely okay to say \u201cdont come\u201d in a right manner. You are not obliged to host anyone, let alone 2 weeks after giving birth, and definitely not if that person requires assistance due to disabilities. Dont worry about it, she will see the reasoning in her own time", "If you just had a baby the last thing you need is a friend who\u2019s going to be more of a burden than help. If they\u2019re a real friend they\u2019ll understand if you tell them, \u201chey I know you\u2019re excited to stay with me to help out with the newborn but honestly I\u2019ll be in recovery and I\u2019m not sure how giving birth is going to affect me so I\u2019m gonna have to ask you to wait until I\u2019m healed and ready for visitors. I hope you understand and I look forward to seeing you once I\u2019m feeling better.\u201d If she still pushes then you have to put your foot down and say \u201clook I know you say you\u2019re bringing meds to help you feel better so you can help with the baby but I don\u2019t think this is a good idea. I\u2019ll have just given birth and the last thing I need is to have visitors and be stressed about that. I really only want my partner around for a while after giving birth so please don\u2019t come until I let you know I\u2019m ready for visitors.\u201d", "YWNBTA. Let her know in black and white terms OP. If she is lacking some social cues (ie you don\u2019t assume you can visit soon after a baby is born, let alone burden new parents by being their guest) due to her autistic traits, it best to be straight-up. \n\nJust tell her she will not be able to stay with you at all, and that the timing does not work for you or your family. If she is hurt by that, then that sucks for her, but if she talks to anyone about it, they will likely put her straight about how inappropriate her plan is too.", "NTA Think of your health.", "YWNBTA\n\nA friend - any friend, with or without the physical and neurological disabilities that are in play here - coming to visit for 3 weeks whilst you\u2019re caring for a newborn, would be a LOT to deal with and you would always be within your rights to say no.  It\u2019s really unfortunate that your friend\u2019s neurodivergence makes it so difficult for them to pick up on your hints and suggestions, but ultimately it is in their nature to want and need clear, explicit statements of your intent.  You\u2019re not doing them a disservice by providing this in the form of a direct \u201cno\u201d - quite the opposite in fact.\n\nIt\u2019s never great to have to effectively reject a friend, especially one who likely has the very best of intentions, but you\u2019re a new mother, your child and your own well-being are your priority here.", "Nta but please tell me\u2026how does this \u201cservice bird\u201d work? (Because seriously there is no such thing as a service bird. It may be an emotional support bird\u2026but it\u2019s not a service animal. I am just so curious how this works. What tasks does the bird do?) your friend can be there to emotionally support you but you\u2019d be physically taking care of her. That\u2019s not how this works after you have a baby.", "YWNBTA You are perfectly reasonable, and if you don't want a friend to come over, a good friend respects that.", "YWNBTA. You need time to heal after a C-section and though she is trying to be helpful it sounds like she won't be of much help at all. You will have a newborn and presumable a toddler (you didn't mention your older child's age), and yourself to care for and that's a lot. Go with your gut on this one and let her know that she is welcome to visit after you feel better.", "As someone with various disabilities: YWNBTA. Write it down for her. Be clear. \u201cI will be in pain. I cannot cook, clean, or help in any way. I will not be able to bend over or carry anything. I will need weeks to recover from a big surgery and need time with my baby. This is not a good time for me. I need this time for myself and my child and I hope you understand that, I love you as a friend, but this is not the time for a three week visit. Maybe we can schedule a trip for a time where I would be able to go out and do things with you. This, alas, is not that time.\u201d\n\nNo need to mention her disabilities, weird ass pet bird (there\u2019s no such thing as an assistance bird) or anything. Keep it close to you,how you would feel bad, be in pain etc. By sending her an email, there is no risk of her not \u201cgetting\u201d it, but you\u2019ll have to be a bit forceful.", "No, but it sounds like you need to be clearer and say something like \n\n\"I appreciate that you are looking at ways to make a visit work, but it won't be possible for you to come so soon after the baby is born, and three weeks may be too long for us - not because we don't like you or want to see you, but because having any house guest so soon after the baby is born doesn't work for us. \n\nWe need  to spend some time just bonding as  a family with our newborn, and not having to think about anyone else, even other people we love, and while I  know you want to help, the most helpful thing you can do in those early weeks once the baby is born it to stay home.!\n\n If you decided to travel to \\[our city\\] anyway, you would need book a hotel or airnbn  but I need to be clear that I won't be available to hang out , or to invite you to our home. Depending on my recovery and how things are once baby is actually here, it's possible we might be able to meet up for a few hours once or twice, but realistically, wouldn't be able to do more than that, and mightn't be able to do that, depending on how things go\n\nAssuming that you are happy for her to visit in due time, I'd then suggest a date - maybe at about the 2 month mark, and make your invitation specific - e.g. \"I do really want to spend time with you and for you to have the chance to meet the baby - would you be able to come for \\[specific dates that suit you\\]?\n\n(I'd suggest that you invite her for a specific period - e.g. 'would you be able to come from 10th-18th September\" so that you are being clear not only on timing, but also on the length of the visit. Maybe 1 week / 10 days  rather than 3 weeks  unless you are 100% sure you would be OK hosting for three weeks. Three weeks is a VERY long time to have a houseguest,)", "NAH\n\nYou\u2019re obviously not the asshole, but I don\u2019t think she is either because she probably doesn\u2019t understand the subtext. When you messaged her about the problems you\u2019d have with her coming over, she didn\u2019t see that it was an implied \u2018we don\u2019t want you here and these are polite reasons why\u2019, she messaged back with solutions.\n\nSay something like \u201cI would normally be very happy to have you around, but my partner and I have decided that after the birth we want some private time to bond with the baby and settle into our new routines. Having an extra person in the house would be very difficult for us. Don\u2019t worry, our problem isn\u2019t with you specifically, we don\u2019t want anyone coming to stay at all.\u201d", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
