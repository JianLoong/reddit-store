I have had nothing to do with my sister\u2019s husband since he cheated on her. He moved in with his new \u2018love of his life\u2019 for 3 months. Then came back to my sister. It has been 10 yrs and I still don\u2019t talk to him. I saw the mess she was in, had to pick her up off the floor where she was crying. Looked after their 4 children, cooked and cleaned for her. And he just waltzed back in like he hadn\u2019t done damage to her or the kids. The kids have all left home since (bolted as soon as they could), they don\u2019t have anything to do with him because of the pain.", "NAH. She's forgiven him and wants to stay together.

I know it will be difficult, but you're doing it to support her, not because you like him.  If she wants her marriage to work and is willing to forgive him, supporting her by trying to get past your issues with him is what you have to do.  Good luck.

You should make sure she is on the title to everything they have (house, cars, and anything else like that), and encourage her to have funds that she can access with or without him.\n           \nI'm not convinced that this is the end of his cheating. You don't have to like him, but in the long run everything you can do to support your sister and nudge her toward more independence will probably be more helpful than cutting off your loser BIL.", "No you not the arsehole! It\u2019s your decision not to be around a cheater! So if they can\u2019t  support your decision maybe it\u2019s time to move on or rethink why your bf wants to hang out with a cheater! Your sister should know why you don\u2019t want to hang out anymore and she\u2019s the arsehole for pressuring you! You can use my saying if you want! \u201cForgiveness is the path of a saint!

I would say that it maybe better for your sister for you all to hang out together a little so for her sake I would suggest you maybe meet up occasionally but do an activity that doesn\u2019t involve you interacting with him much. I would also warn your boyfriend that although you are ok with him hanging out together you still don\u2019t feel 100% comfortable with him having a close relationship with him again considering he thinks it ok to cheat on his wife for 3 months and shows he has low morals. Support your sister anyway you can but let it be know to him how you really feel and how his actions not only let down his wife and son but the entire extended family and if he does anything like that again his life won\u2019t be worth living.", "YTA. At this point you are simply causing your poor sister even more stress and conflict, preventing her from healing her relationship, a decision that she, an independent adult, decided to move forward with. I would stop making this about you and do as your sister, the true victim here, asks you to do. Otherwise you are most definitely not \"supporting her in any way you can\". \n\nTLDR: its not about you.", "You are being a bit unreasonable\u2026 my brother-in-law sit me down one weekend I had come to visit in my hometown and told me he had cheated on my sister.. also told me how sorry he was.. I told him long as my sister has forgiven and they are still together he doesn\u2019t have a problem with me.. \n\nHe thanked me for feeling that way and we\u2019ve had good relationship to this day.. I can call him and he will help me do things me as a single older sister can\u2019t do.. \n\nLong as your sister is happy you have no reason to not want to be around him.", "Putting aside all this other context, you shouldn\u2019t be forced to hang out with him just because you don\u2019t like him and you\u2019re angry at him.

I cut him out of my life because I just don't want to associate with someone who would do that to the person who trusts them the most. Truth be told, I never got along with his wife, but I won't condone cheating on any level.", "NTA. If she wants to stay in a relationship with him, that's her decision and I would let it go. \n\nI'm torn about your SO and whether you should tell him to stop associating with him. Subconsciously you could make it seem like fidelity isn't important to you if you say nothing to him. I would take the time (regardless what decision you all make) to tell him that you are 100% different from your sister and any infidelity would result in an immediate end to your relationship.", "Uh why the heck is your bf okay being around him? Why isn't he upset for your sister? NTA", "NTA. But why is the bf pushing this????? Why would he support a CHEATING lying ah? I personably wouldn\u2019t spend one second alone with the cheater, never laugh at a joke or say a kind word, and I\u2019d definitely speak to your bf about supporting a fucking cheater.", "NTA. It\u2019s so much easier to forgive someone who hurts us than it is to forgive someone who hurts a person we love.", "NTA, you don't have to hang out with her husband if you don't want to. I wouldnt either if my brother got married and his wife cheated on him. It's your choice who you wish to spend your time with and you have every right to be mad at your sisters husband. He's not a very nice person if he's going to cheat on your sister, a woman who has supported him all throughout their relationship. I hope things get better, I'm really sorry about what happened.. :<", "Info OP: When you say \"caught him having an affair\" wdym? Sexting? Walked in on them? Was contacted by the mistress?", "NTA. I totally get it. I will never forgive my ex-brother-in-law for **literally** kicking my sister in the butt and yelling at her to \"Get over it!\" when our mother died. And also dumping her with two kids and no child support when he left her for another woman with two replacement kids. I saw him for the first time in many years a couple years ago and he acted so very glad to see me, as if I was one of his favorite people. I did a good acting job of being OK with him in order not to spoil the party, but underneath I was thinking, \"If you only knew how I really feel about you...\" So please know that your feelings about your cheating BIL are totally normal and justified.", "NTA\n\nDespite the fact I\u2019d personally want to go scorched earth on him, but I\u2019d maintain the relationship just to not harm the relationship you have with your sister. You don\u2019t want her isolated. \n\nI\u2019d tell her that in addition to breaking her heart and trust, his actions created a conflict between you two (as well as you and your bf) that otherwise wouldn\u2019t exist. Seems like everyone else is bearing the brunt of his actions, and that\u2019s unfair. \n\nI can see what I\u2019m about to say get down voted to hell, but leaving can also be a good example to set for her child. It shows self respect. That said, I wouldn\u2019t hound your sister for her decision. The ones cheated on seem to get held to a weird standard (in general society).\n\nYour BIL should pay her for the years of support she provided *with interest*. I doubt she\u2019ll want it, but I\u2019d want him to pay back her investment into him. He takes and takes and takes from your sister. When he shows he\u2019s willing to give to her a return on her investment - no strings attached, then at least she\u2019s not 100% a martyr. \n\nI hope your nephew learns what his dad did. Let your BIL face those consequences. Although I do hope your nephew learns in adulthood. I\u2019d hate for a child to carry that pain and anger.\n\nLastly, I\u2019d low key be skeptical of my bf if he came off as chill as yours did when he learned his good friend cheated (let alone on his SIL)\u2026 the company you keep.", "NTA Yea no. She can forgive but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to forgive his actions of hurting her. She invited you (understandably) into this mess and shouldn\u2019t hold that against you because she wants to stay with the cheater and invite paranoia and possible future affairs into her life. \n\nAlso why is your boyfriend okay with this? Would he be so forgiving if your sister was the one who cheated or if OP cheated? Birds of a feather would have me concerned about his true stance on cheating and being around/friends with a cheater. It\u2019s easier to feel justified with cheating when you get no consequences and/or are around others who don\u2019t view cheating as a dealbreaker.", "NTA\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. You don\u2019t have to forgive him. But you will harm your relationship with your sister. You will miss out on time with her, so punishing her. \n\nIt\u2019s awkward for sure. Been there. But have seen couples come bk from infidelity stronger. You also don\u2019t truly know what their marriage is like behind closed doors.", "NTA, my resentment of someone is palpable when I walk in the room. It's a bad idea to seat me near someone like that. Was he sorry at all?", "cheating, specially in the circumstances explained, is reasonable but not wanting to hangout with a cheater is not. Who died and made them oracles of reason!", "NTA  You never have to hang out with someone with such low morals.  He sounds like a shitty person.  I think your right for wanting to stay as far away from him as possible.  That would be a hard boundary for me as well.  How do you even look at him the same again?  How does she get in a bed with someone like that?", "NTA", "Unlike your sister who can forgive and forget and your bil for no emotional feelings  I can fully understand how upset you were for his behaviour behind your sisters back and for your concerns and wanting  to protect your sister Sisters are bonded and strong we take care and put each other first  I think that your sister and cheating husband have to understand that it is harder for you to forgive and be all friends again  You don't have something invested in the relationship to need to be friends your sister though has your nephew that she wants 2 parents to be there for him You may need to just sit down and explain your feelings if she can forgive her husband for a far worse thing then she should be understanding to you  I mean you were the one helping her deal with the infidelity watching her pain which is his fault you don't feel like socialising or befriending him as you felt hurt for your sister which was his doing You don't go back to everything normal after such bad decisions  All men would cheat if it was this easy \nI hate to say this but he cheated for a reason your sister using your nephew for a reason to stay with him has not resolved why? He has the personality to do it all over again with no backlash I mean what does he have to lose if she is submissive to be honest  I'm with you darling I couldn't sit and swallow my food across the table from him  He's lucky I'm not his SIL he would be running  I can't stand a cheat then you don't mess with my family so no your not the A.H he is even your sister for asking you to hang  out really", "NTA tell your sister, \"you told me information about your marriage that changes the way I look at your husband. Now when I see him all I see is the pain he caused you. And you can't demand I move on from something like that just because you did. Going forwards, maybe keep that in mind when you share your marital issues with people. Not everyone is going to be able to forgive and forget the things you can. I no longer want to associate with your husband outside of family gatherings and that's not going to change. You need to find a new couple to double-date with.\"", "Ya I was \ud83d\udc40", "You are the company you keep after all", "And if she finds she can't actually forgive him, or discovers his cheating again she needs to be able to rely on the support of op.\n\nOp you don't have to be his best friend, you don't have to have him around all the time, but it would be wise to not ostracise him. You can be civil and polite.\n\nHe didn't just damage his relationship with his wife but also with the people around her who trusted him to respect her and treat her well and be a good example for his kid.

To some people family comes first and her sister\u2019s husband proved that he didn\u2019t care very much about her sister so why should she give a single gram of fuck about him! She supports her sister\u2019s decision to stay with the cheating arseclown so why doesn\u2019t her sister support her decision not to hang out with cheating arseclown.The question that needs asking is why is bf wanting to hang out with the cheater when he knows his gf wants nothing to do with him! \ud83e\udd14maybe  two \ud83e\udedbs in  a pod!"]}
