My mom asks me if I'm going to get something for him, but it's more of the you're-buying-it-tone and not an actual question. He only likes cake pops, but they're 4 bucks, and I don't want to pay for his all the time. I pay with my card with my own money.\n\nIt's so annoying to have to spend it and no one ever pays me back. They don't say they will, but my mom argues it \"builds the relationship between us.\" My brother never gives me anything, he doesn't have any money, so he doesn't buy anything for himself or anyone.\n\nThe other day I had enough loyalty points to buy a free drink.

Your brother (7) is old enough to learn the basics about earning and saving money to buy things that he wants. If your mother thinks it's okay for him to get drinks or candy regularly from expensive places like Starbucks, she should give him a weekly allowance for doing chores and getting good grades. I understand her thought process to an extent and it would also be nice for you to want to give gifts to your brother occasionally, but you are only 13 and have limited funds. The money you earn should be your spending money with a little set aside for gifts.

Except your little brother and people that have no concept of how little they get for their money.  \n\nYTA if you expect her to pay $4 just because you want a drink yourself.  Save it for when little bro is not in the car.  Mom is TA because she isn't parenting well.  She can't win if you get a drink.  Either she has to pay, or she has to deal with his meltdown.

Brother thinks you are equals and he needs to learn that it's your money not moms and that he isn't entitled to anything. It's one thing to treat him every now and then but it's a whole other thing to what has happened up until now. I would understand buying mom something if she is going out of her way to take you and maybe she sees you buying your brother something as this, however if it is on the way to school or just a bit out of the way that doesn't constitute something each and every time. Your brother is obviously spoiled and doesn't need a treat especially each time. Nip this in the bud or you will eventually be expected to buy something each time you buy yourself something.
