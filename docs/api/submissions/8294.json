He is attending and sitting with our family next to my sister (as he should). The question is whether he walks down the aisle at the beginning with our family or not.**\n\nThrowaway. Help please.\n\nBtw- They've been dating for over a year. Our family has tried to get to know him, but it hasn't worked - he's basically a stranger to us.\n\nI told my sister that I didn't think it was appropriate, because although her bf is to her, he wasn't close with our dad, and his funeral is about *him*, not *her*.\n\nShe got extremely upset and said she felt hurt that I would deprive her of having her support system by her side during one of the hardest moments of her life.\n\nI felt bad immediately, because I truly do want my sister to feel supported and cared for during. But still think my point is valid. Why should her boyfriend walk alongside the grieving family at my dad's funeral, when they've only met a handful of times?\n\nI feel like such an asshole for even thinking that. My sister wants him there for support.\n\nBut it's *our dad's* funeral, this is his last hurrah and they barely knew each other. Why is she being so selfish by making this about her feelings only?\n\nShe left to calm down, and I'm left being conflicted with whether I'm the asshole in this situation or not. I still don't want him to walk with us, but AITA? Will I regret standing by my decision?\n\n**Edit**: Grammar\n\n**Edit:** Just a couple things after reading some comments-\n\nFirst, to the vicious commenters, please have in mind that my sister isn't the only one who's dad just died - be kind.\n\nThank you to the respectful commenters who are helping me see the bigger picture and my sister's perspective more and more.\n\nTo clarify, the decision was put up to a vote in my family and so far the majority is against the bf coming for various reasons. I'm the deciding vote and that's why I posted.\n\nMy main reasoning(s) for not wanting him there are:\n\n\\- He barely knew my dad. My dad especially continuously tried to get to know him, but my sister resisted by cancelling plans last min etc.\n\n\\- When discussing (unrelated) decisions about the funeral at an earlier time, things got heated and to defend my sister, the bf acted fresh with my brother and gave his (unsolicited) opinion on what we should do. This wasn't the first time something like this happened, though he apologised afterwards.\n\n\\- Because of logistics, we have had to turn down other members of the family to walk in the procession. Why should he be any different?\n\n**Edit:** Not sure if it's relevant but my sister and I are both in our 20s. The bf is my sister's first relationship.\n\n**Edit: Just got off the phone with my sister. I called to apologise and tell her that her feeling supported in this situation comes above anything else (thank you for the insightful comments). Essentially, I'm the asshole. But after talking to her friends, she thinks having her bf sit next to her front row but not in the procession is a fair middle ground - considering his (lack of) relationship with us.** \n\n**Grief is weird.**", "created_utc": 1674690520, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ldn18/aita_for_not_allowing_my_sisters_boyfriend_to/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But I'll give you this advice: \n\nFunerals are not for the deceased. Funerals are for the loved ones who still remain. Ask yourself, would your dad care more about who was walking in the procession or about each person who he was close to feeling loved and supported during it. \n\nPlease allow your sister to have her support beside her. I promise it is more important and anyone who questions his presence will be the true AHs here.", "After your edit, I am going to go with NAH. Since other family members feel this way and there is conflict with the boyfriend I can understand why it might be weird having him in the procession. I can also understand why she would want him there and why he would want to defend her in a heated discussion. It sounds like there are a lot of heightened emotions at play here. Just remember that things said and done even in grief cannot be taken back later.

I think a lot of people did not actually read the post. He is not being excluded from the funeral, but the family procession.

As I was at the hospital with the family, etc when she passed. It was not an experience I would care to relive. Walking down the aisle with him and his family and taking care of him all day during the services wasn't fucking any fun at all. Even though we'd been together 4 years at this point and I'd had my share of disagreements with his mom in this time period (even though I love(d) her more than I ever thought I would after first meeting her) I hadn't met like 70% of his very large extended Catholic family. I'm a practicing witch... like you can see how weird this was for me going in.\n\nYour sister's boyfriend is coming from a place of discomfort to comfort your sister, which is already admirable.

There is one family vote for \"in\", why do you vote \"out\". Is it extra hassle? Will the out of town family make assumptions that they shouldn't.

Personally, if tell you to FO, and do what I wanted. \n\nSadly, the deceased are no longer there, so it's not \"for\"them.  Funerals are for the people who loved the deceased to say goodbye.

The funeral is for the family to grieve and her boyfriend is her support system.\n\nYou claim she made it about her feelings, but you did the same thing.

Funerals are for the living, not the dead. You deprived her of her support system for no valid reason.", "YTA. It's HER dad too and she wants the support. So what if he wasn't best buddies with your dad. He is a major person to your SISTER and she is grieving as well. You're being selfish making this all about YOUR wants and needs. In my opinion. And I'm sorry for yalls loss it's an awful thing and emotions are raring. I would say apologize and let your sister have your support. Deaths/funerals cause massive family rifts all the time. I stepped out of my family for 13 years after our last one because of the way my aunts behaved. It is a terrible thing to go through. Don't let this be something that tears your family apart just because you want it the way you visioned it should go.", "INFO: Is the ENTIRE family participating in the procession? Cousins, extended family? Nieces and Nephews? If it is everyone but him, then yeah you are.", "What harm would it do? Why (I say this gently) does it matter if he didn't know your dad well? To my mind that doesn't detract from anything if he walks with you for your sister's sake.\n\nYou call her selfish, but she is just wanting support. It seems more selfish to deny her request for a reason that isn't really clear.\n\nIt doesn't dishonor your dad if he walks with you. You seem to have an idea that walking with the family is claiming a close relationship with your dad that he didn't have, but who says that's what it means? Seems like only you. \n\nYou're all going through a terribly hard time, and it's important to love each other as hard as you can to get through it. \n\nThink about which option is showing your sister as much love as you can right now.

We didn\u2019t know how fast it was all going to happen and she couldn\u2019t get there in time. I was with my whole extended family, but I felt extremely alone not having my partner there when I was grieving. I love my family, we get along great, but I\u2019m decidedly the black sheep. This usually doesn\u2019t matter, but my outsider status flairs in times of grief like that. My whole family are Christians, with the exception of myself, my partner, and one uncle. So when grieving starts it\u2019s all about the Christian perspective on grief. \u201cWe\u2019ll see them again in heaven,\u201d \u201cThey went to a better place,\u201d the normal lines of thought and coping. While it doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal, when you\u2019re the sole person in the room who doesn\u2019t believe these things, when you\u2019re the only one who the comfort doesn\u2019t apply to, it\u2019s very isolating.

It also made me much closer to her.\n\nWas your sister important to your dad? \n\nYou had the chance to include him, yet you chose to exclude him. Instead of getting closer you drove a wedge between your family and the BF, but more importantly, with your sister. YTA.

You're all grieving right now, and should just try to help each other instead of getting into a dispute like this one.", "My viewpoint is that the funeral isn't for the dead because they've moved on.  The funeral is for the living.  The funeral offers support,  common grieving, a chance to interact with family and friends.   I would not have excluded the guy.  But that's me.

Just let him walk and keep it moving. This is not important e ouch to argue about, and you should tell your family that.", "YTA because in my experience they way the family walks down the aisle is also the order they sit in so it would make sense for him to walk to make sure that he can sit by her during the funeral. Also funerals are not for the ones who have passed. They are for the ones left behind. This should be more about the support that your sister needs not about your dad really. Also your dad is not going to be affected by this in any way shape or form. Wherever you believe him to be he literally does not care about this so again it's not about your dad.", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to decide what support your sister (or anyone else) needs.

Which includes your SISTER's Grief.", "YTA: This is not a wedding procession or parade. Your sister is allowed to define her grief and what support she needs. You were very non-supportive, maybe due to your own grief. Actually funerals are for the living to acknowledge a loved one.", "YTA - keep with and be prepared to not only lose your father but also your sister. Why would she want anything to do with any of you who don\u2019t care about her, only about how it \u201clooks\u201d.

I've been to a few funerals and the idea that there's only so much space for people to _walk_ just makes no sense to me. I can appreciate awkwardness about who will speak, and which people will carry the coffin (I have done both at family funerals) but seriously you're trying to blame logistics for this? It's a funeral not a wedding.\n\nFinally, as others have said, the funeral isn't really for the deceased - it's for everybody else. His relationship, or lack of one, with your dad shouldn't really matter unless it was actively negative/hostile. What matters is his relationship with your grieving sister. His presence is important _to her_ and that should be enough.", "You are allowed a vote on the matter, just like everyone else is. But keep in mind you are basing this on *your* feelings while disregarding hers. You even say you *\"feel like such an asshole\"* for your feelings on the matter.  Funerals are for the grieving, and your sister is a grieving family member.\n\nIf possible, I'd recommend having another family discussion about it that includes your sister, followed by a secret vote (nobody knows what anyone else voted) so that way no one person will have to be the deciding vote.", "I lost two parents and two brothers, two didn't make 50.  So I hate seeing this kind of stuff at a time of tremendous loss.\n\nI'm sincerely sorry for your loss.  But, a funeral isn't a time to point out people's failings, shortcomings or issues, \" you didn't live up to this expectation, so you have to sit alone, while your significant other sits here.\nI get why you feel this way, I really do, I easily could've blocked quite a few people or regulated them to the basement.  But out of respect for my siblings, I didn't.  Her support is her support, you don't have to like him, but for her sake, I really wouldn't make this a battle that will always be remembered at your dad's funeral.

Our family has tried to get to know him, but it hasn't worked - he's basically a stranger to us.\n\nI told my sister that I didn't think it was appropriate, because although her bf is to her, he wasn't close with our dad, and his funeral is about *him*, not *her*. \n\nShe got extremely upset and said she felt hurt that I would deprive her of having her support system by her side during one of the hardest moments of her life.\n\nI felt bad immediately, because I truly do want my sister to feel supported and cared for during. But still think my point is valid. Why should her boyfriend walk alongside the grieving family at my dad's funeral, when they've only met a handful of times? \n\nI feel like such an asshole for even thinking that. My sister wants him there for support. \n\nBut it's *our dad's* funeral, this is his last hurrah and they barely knew each other. Why is she being so selfish by making this about her feelings only?\n\nShe left to calm down, and I'm left being conflicted with whether I'm the asshole in this situation or not. I still don't want him to walk with us, and but AITA? Will I regret standing by my decision?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I\u2019m going against everyone and going with \n\nNAH\n\nGiven it\u2019s your sisters first relationship, they\u2019ve been together for a while and she\u2019s probably really relying on him during this for comfort, I can see why she\u2019d want him walking with her. \n\nHowever, your sister isn\u2019t the only person grieving this loss. And if the other family members don\u2019t want him walking with the family, I\u2019m leaning more towards he shouldn\u2019t be walking with you guys. \n\nEspecially if you\u2019re turning down relatives due to covid restrictions. I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t think he needs to be allowed to walk with your sister when he will be sitting by her.", "Yta", "The bf is obviously is going to the funeral that isn\u2019t the issues, the issue is about him walking in the procession which over half of your family is against. The procession is the time where the family and close friends walk with their loved one one last time. It\u2019s symbolic for the people who loved them and supported them in their lifetime, the people who join them on their journey to their final resting place. That\u2019s how it\u2019s always been explained to me at least (I am from the Bible Belt so maybe there is more a spiritual meaning in my area?). Sorry but the bf who didn\u2019t know your father well doesn\u2019t get to be in the procession if some of the family won\u2019t be allowed due to numbers. I think him planning to sit with the sister at the funeral and the wake for support but not be in the procession is a good compromise. My family members\u2019 SOs who were not married in or close to the family have always sat with the family during funerals but sat during the procession and rejoined their SO right after the procession. It\u2019s about a 5 minute process depending on the size of the church and how long it takes to put the casket in the hearse.", "I work in the funeral industry. Funerals are steeped in lore and tradition. Usually a funeral procession is filled with CLOSE family members first. In this case it sounds like the boyfriend was barely liked by the greater family. The sister should have acknowledged this. The BF can still be in the procession but further back in the line. He could have met up with gf later during the service. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThe judgement has nothing to do with whether the bf should be there to comfort the sister or if he should be able to attend the services. That is NOT the issue although a lot of people seem to have missed this. \n\nThe judgement is about not treating the sister\u2019s bf as part of the father\u2019s mourning family for a small part of the service - a part that (by necessity) also excludes other family members. \n\nSince that bf was not close to the father during the year or so he dated the sister and only interacted with the father a few times, he shouldn\u2019t be included. This seems fair since other people with *significantly closer* relationships are also being excluded.", "OP I\u2019m late to this but I\u2019m reading through how well you\u2019ve handled everything. As someone who lost their own mother a few months back, the entire funeral situation is surreal. Yes, grief is weird. And messy. Be kind to yourself and yours moving forward. It\u2019s going to take awhile. \n\nNAH", "I am so sorry for your loss. Grief is weird and this time is difficult. Lean on one another. I'm happy you were able to talk it out and compromise.", "YTA, why in the world does it matter if he's able to walk your bereaved sister down the isle at the funeral? I'm so sorry for your loss, but this is petty!", "Don't know, that hasn't happened yet..", "The op stated that the boyfriend would be there the issue is the boyfriend (who didn't take time to get to know the family) walking with the family.", "I agree!", "You can support someone without having to walk down the aisle", "My dad's immediate family. For all the decisions we've put them to a vote. \n\nCurrently, majority is against the bf walking with us. I'm the deciding vote, hence the post.", "To clarify, my sister asked to put this to a vote.\n\nAnd thank you for your perspective, I see your point.\n\nEdit: My sister told us to vote because she thinks it's the fair thing to do. Right after he died, we all agreed to talk out any disagreements and put them to a vote, so we make all decisions together, as a family.", "It\u2019s not the whole funeral, it\u2019s the procession which is usually only immediate family and the closest of friends.", "You obviously don\u2019t get it. Him being there will give them less condolences. It\u2019ll be split by by another factor. Math, duh\u2026/s", "Did you even read their post?\n\nThe boyfriend will be at the funeral its just the walking with the grieving family that is up for debate. The boyfriend made little to no attempt to get to know the father. Also op is the deciding vote, seems the majority of the family does not want the boyfriend to walk with them", "I'm starting to think you're right...\n\nI guess I just find it frustrating that despite various (unsuccessful) attempts to include him before this, I/we are expected to have no opinion whatsoever on whether he joins our family during such a vulnerable moment.\n\nI've been thinking so much about us (the family) as a collective, not individuals, and your comment made me realise that only one of these outcomes is going to really harm an individual.\n\nThanks for the comment!", "He\u2019s attending the funeral though. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any issues about him attending the funeral?", "Maybe the sister can skip the funeral?", "Do you think having bf there would really be such a hindrance? Probably not.\n\nIt seems your experience is tainting your judgment.", "Well said", "why is that weird?", "It's weird that she wants someone who will be there to solely support her? No.", "Does it feel good to have taken the time to write this cruel comment to a 21-year-old days after her father died?\n\nI made this post to try and do the right thing. I know my own judgement is fucked up from being in shock at the traumatic loss. I'm trying.", "He will be there, no one is saying he can\u2019t attend the funeral. The question is about the procession. Attendees of a funeral watch the procession, so he will be watching it.", "But he will be there. Him attending the funeral itself isn\u2019t the issue, OP is asking about the procession.", "All of this is answered in the post.", "We have all tried to get to know him, but he and my sister have no interest in doing that.", "He isn't being excluded from the funeral.", "He is sitting by her during the funeral either way.", "The edit wasn't for people to take into consideration for judgements, but more-so for the vicious commenters, who are unnecessarily being mean. The judgments are fair, the delivery - not so much.\n\nAlso, the church where the funeral is going to be is in a retirement home complex so because of covid cases rising, we DO have some restrictions. \n\nBut yeah, if he walks with us, we will make it work - he is just one addition. \n\nWhat I meant was that we couldn't say yes to others (family members, his best friends) because we don't have the space and couldn't choose between them. And all of them have refused as well, to respect covid rules.", "Exactly. And he\u2019s still going to the funeral. He\u2019s not being excluded, and he\u2019ll be there to support the sister.", "Absolutely.", "So? You can also support someone by letting them have their partner walk with them.\n\nThis moment is going to be horrible for everyone, including OP's sister. Adding to her pain isn't going to take anyone else's away. Let him walk with her.", "Why are you against your sister having her boyfriend as someone to lean on in a hard time for her?", "I don't think this is ultimately about assholes. This is about a grieving family with some different thoughts. My suggestion: Get everyone together in one room and talk it through.\n\nRemember, funerals are for the loved ones of the deceased. Its a way to say goodbye. You folk need to work out what that means for all of you, and what will help each of you go through the process and move on to healing. Don't worry about whether you are being \"the asshole\". Worry about trying to do what's best for everyone that's hurting.", "Don't listen to these y t a who are being wilfully obtuse", "Did she also participate in the vote?", "And their partners", "Yikes. Hope it feels good for you guys. Jesus.", "Did you read mine?\n\nHe's not a stranger to HER aka the sister. The sister has the right to want her partner there with her. OP is out of line", "No, he is definitely attending. It's about if he walks down the aisle with us or not.", "I agree there\u2019s no issue with the bf attending and I think it\u2019s important the sister does have support there irrespective of the relationships with the dad. But OP has clearly said the bf will be there and nobody has said the bf can\u2019t attend the funeral. I think the procession itself is a bit more nuanced though?", "He will be there though, that\u2019s never been in question.", "The boyfriend was invited. He can sit with all of the other close family friends etc. He\u2019ll still be there to support her.", "[deleted]", "It wasn't cruel, it was my opinion, that you asked for. Don't read it as an attack.", "Ok sorry didn't read some of that first time NTA", "So is he going to be sitting already. Do you want him to come in after you all have set down and then scoot past people and call attention to himself. Wouldn't it be easier to just let him walk. It doesn't hurt anyone and it helps your sister out", "They've had to turn down family members from walking with them. A boyfriend who didn't really take the time to get to know the dad doesn't need to walk with them to be supportive", "Yes of course.", "If married, yes. We've never had unmarried partners in any family funeral procession and I've never known anyone who did that.", "Not always.", "Well, to be fair. I\u2019ve never seen a deceased person upset by who was at their funeral, or in their precession, at least on Reddit. \n\nUsually family fighting over no sequential things that tear them apart when they should be supporting each other. Pretty sure the passed would be more upset by that.", "The partner will be there. It is completely okay for the rest of the family to not want the partner to walk with them. Neither OP nor the rest of their family is out of line with this.", "That\u2019s how I understood your post. I think as long as he\u2019s there, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for people and your sister to say she\u2019s being denied of support. I mean, some family members in the procession may be single - does that mean their friends will be walking in the procession to support them? I doubt it. But they can be there to offer support.", "I'm struggling to understand what you're conveying, I'm sorry", "[deleted]", "Why does it have to be limited? Wouldn't more support be better?", "The plan was that he enters the church with everyone else and waits for us at the front. \n\nThat way he is there to support my sister before and throughout the funeral, but the procession remains intimate and for the immediate family.", "I'm interested in who they had to turn down and why. What logistics prevent an extra person from walking down an aisle?", "That's good. \n\nI must say, I have a very hard time understanding why you wouldn't want him in there after your sister expressed the need to lean on him during that difficult moment. I get that he didn't earn that spot but funerals aren't really about that. I sincerely do not understand what or who it would hurt. I think no one is going to cry harder if he walks by your sister's side. We know your sister will have a harder time if he doesn't.\n\nIt seems like such a petty concern, such an unnecessary conflict, at a time that should be about remembrance, healing, togetherness and mutual support. This issue, turning her harmless request to have her boyfriend by her side during the walk into an issue, detracts from what's important. It has already caused hurt, anger, guilt, a need to post here, and for what? What was gained?\n\nI'm also not sure I get how COVID factors into this, since he counts as present whether he walks with your sister or whether he walks in a minute earlier and sits/stands. \n\nBut that's just my personal opinion. I understand others will feel differently and obviously, your family (including you and your sister) are the ones whose feelings matter, as is what your father would have wanted after hearing your sister out. \n\nAs for judgement, it's a NAH for me, as it's clear your heart is in the right place and you are just grappling with your feelings and trying to figure out the right thing to do. You are all grieving, dealing with heightened emotions, and trying your best.\n\nIs it possible that you are subconsciously driven by unresoved resentment for his previous lack of involvement in the family?", "That's very weird and arbitrary. A piece of paper shouldn't make someone more worthy of supporting their partner through a terrible time in their life. This is the deceased's *daughter* not some distant relative.\n\nWhen my mom passed, my bf didn't leave my side. It was not even a discussion that he would accompany me in the procession. Same with my brother's gf.", "I was. It was even a Catholic funeral.", "Yeah that wasn't at all my issue. Your original comments were just a bit callous. Never said I agree or disagree with what you, or OP said.", "\"The majority are against and I'm the deciding vote\"\n\nAka, they're split down the middle.", "[deleted]", "OP responded in another comment but its covid restrictions and the venue not being a church. The ones turned down were close to their father", "I didn't say I agreed with it, I said what the most common thing that is done for that is.\n\nI wouldn't want him there if he was a stranger to the deceased. Yes, funerals are for the living but it weirds me out seeing a bunch of random people who didn't actually *know* the dead show up.", "You\u2019re 100% right. It did sound callous. Just frustration on how often funerals tear families apart and how the main issue is such an non issue.\n\nYou sound like a very nice and caring person:)", "No, currently we are majority against by 1 (me). If I change my vote, then the majority changes = I'm the deciding vote.", "I understand what you're saying 100%. When my MIL passed, my BIL's GF came to everything, but she didn't participate in the planning at all.", "Those people couldn't attend at all, but the boyfriend is going to be at the funeral either way. I don't know what restriction would allow him to be in the room but prevent him from walking into the room at a certain time. That doesn't seem to be relevant", "You wouldn't want your sister's boyfriend of a *year*? That's cold", "I agree completely, funerals really bring out everything, good bad and ugly. And you do too! Thank you!", "Right. So your family is split down the middle.\n\nAnyway, you are the asshole. I 100% think that and there are no two ways around it. You're fishing for reasons to make your sister feel worse at her father's funeral.", "Thank you for your perspective. I get what you\u2019re saying as well and agree.", "Sorry for your loss.", "When my husbands granddad died it didn\u2019t even cross my mind to walk down the central aisle with him and the rest of the deceased immediate family. I\u2019m there to support him, not because of my close relationship to his family member, so I sat next to him, of course, but I went in with everyone else, not with immediate family.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s actually a right or wrong here and I don\u2019t think anyone is an AH (NAH), but I think it\u2019s completely reasonable for you to feel weird about this, I know I would.", "Glad you two found a middle ground that makes sense (as you\u2019d suggested). \n\nNAH grief is insane! Mine took ten years and I didn\u2019t notice until now (10 Yr anniversary is in a week).\n\nTake care, sorry for your loss.", "Soft YTA. Funeral is for everyone. BF is her support and depriving her of that is an AH thing to do. It really shouldn\u2019t effect you and yours with who walks down the aisle", "Grief is weird. The funeral is for the living, and if she wishes his support you should grant it. People will have more important things to talk about. NAH.", "YTA. Funerals are for the grieving, not the dead. Don't deprive your sister of a support system.", "And he\u2019ll be there. This is just about whether he walks down with the immediate family or not.", "Thank you, I really needed to hear this. It means a lot!!", "His attendance at the funeral has NEVER been in question.", "\\*walking with a grieving daughter who is requesting he be present for her support.", "I apologize, I didn't mean to sound rude. I meant that your sister seemed to really want/need him with her, and that it might've been hard to walk down that aisle without him. I hope your pain eases soon.", "I\u2019ve never been to a funeral where partners walk in the procession, unless they were also close to the deceased (so if they were a partner of 20 years they may well be included but that\u2019s actually because they\u2019ve known the deceased for 20 years as, effectively, a close family member. Not just because they are with or married to a close family member).", "You're right, I'm sorry. \n\nThe lack of sleep and my whirlwind of emotions are getting to me - I reacted badly to the last part of your comment, in the heat of the moment. \n\nReading it back now, I can see that my reaction was disproportionate. I'm sorry again.", "OP counts as part of the family, so at the moment the majority of the family don\u2019t want him walking down with them."]}
