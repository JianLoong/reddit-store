Even if they are housesitting?  I feel like it\u2019s an invasion of privacy watching them", "Saying it\u2019s odd is fine, now if you were rude about it you\u2019re tah. It\u2019s for sure an awkward situation for everyone. I imagine your parents didn\u2019t expect Jenny to be naked when they checked the cameras, they didn\u2019t get mad Jenny was naked at their house, they didn\u2019t pretend like nothing happened to avoid their awkwardness and risk the pool guy walking in on Jenny. And they didn\u2019t watch jenni get walked in on naked bc they thought it\u2019d be funny.", "Info - how clear are these cameras (meaning, could they really see much)?", "YTA. Your parents own the house / the property / the cameras. They are entitled to check them whenever they feel like it. I check mine multiple times a day. If Jenny isn\u2019t bothered, why are you?. You are completely in the wrong to get mad your parents checked their own cameras.", "YTA \nWhy is she laying around naked when you know they have cameras? \nThat's weird", "NAH but I do find it weird that your parents were peeping at their house sitters when the house sitters were family. It would feel invasive to me too, so I validate you on that, OP! Good thing your wife was unbothered :)", "NAH ig. I mean, you can be upset about it, and it's kinda invading privacy, but also your parents have the right to check on their house. It doesn't sound like your dad wasn't malicious with it, but just gave you a headsup. Your wife wasn't bothered by it, too, the person who should be bothered by it the most.", "YTA. You're acting like they purposely watched her, and got off on it. Ffs. They probably did what normal people do, check their cameras. Especially since they knew a pool guy was coming. A normal person would rationalize that they were embarrassed to see her, but didn't want a complete stranger... The pool guy... To walk in on her possibly causing a problem. So of course they brought it to your attention... As their child.", "NTA\n\nWhy do they have cameras and keep checking on them yet *still* have housesitters? Am I missing the point that its one or the other? I really wouldn't be cool with being spied on either, to be fair.", "YTA it's their house and your wife figured there were cameras but still did it anyways. If I had someone house sit for me and I turned on the cameras to see them walking around my living room naked and I called them to stop doing that I would be in the right because it's my house my rules.", "INFO: did you know that there were cameras there?", "YTA", "NAH. Did you stop to think that maybe they checked the cameras *because* they were checking to see if the pool guy was there yet OR to see if anyone was using the pool before he got there to avoid an embarrassing situation? Nobody seems to care here but you. I think you're overreacting by a lot here in my personal opinion.", "YTA.

More specifically, did you know that you were being watched? Because if not ... your parents have a real problem. You're a young married couple doing them a favor. You deserve your privacy. What if you were having sex by the pool. \"Hi, son, I want to give you some pointers. It turns your mom on when I...\" This type of surveillance skeeves me the heck out.", "YTA. It is perfectly normal that your parents wanted to check the cameras at their house while they were away and honestly I think it\u2019s a little weird that your wife was just hanging out naked at someone else\u2019s house even if no one else is there. Plus if she doesn\u2019t care that your parents check the cameras and saw her naked then you should drop it, they didn\u2019t see you naked so why is it such a big deal to you?", "NTA. I think it\u2019s frankly weird they would check the cameras AT ALL during the time you were watching the house.    Sure,heads up the pool guy coming, same for any vendor, but\u2026I would ask them why they checked at all.", "What r u upset about?", "YTA.\n\nShe was skinny dipping in someone else's pool. They have external security cameras and checked it, which is a fairly common behavior. If the cameras were in the bedroom, bathroom, etc., then sure, that would have been inappropriate. As it is, your wife can't get upset that she was caught skinny dipping.", "YTA", "Yep, overreacted for sure! It\u2019s their home and their right to do so. It\u2019s not like they have cameras in inappropriate places. The bigger question is why would Jenny think it\u2019s ok to be nude and her in-laws even if it was to sun tan or swim that\u2019s so gross!", "Security camera's are a gateway to OF.  You better keep an eye on her.  LOL", "Yeah.  You can be uncomfortable that your dad saw your wife naked. BUT YTA  only for making it about your dad's choice to check the cameras in his own home an issue.   Sometimes NO ONE is wrong.  If he had noticed a package at the doorstep and contacted you  would you have felt it was odd?  Many times the cameras send notifications of movement.  I am sure the pool guy's arrival sent an alert to you dad and he saw your wife.   You may be overthinking this because of the awkward nature of your dad seeing your wife nude.", "Yta.\n\nWhat are you worried about. That was an awesome assist from mom and dad.\nAlso, you're an adult. Stop over reacting to meaningless bs.", "YTA, If the person who was seen naked is saying they don't care then drop it, and it's not weird for them to check cameras at their house.", "You're not an ah but you ARE totally overreacting...  nice of them to let her know so she wasn't surprised by a virtual stranger in her bday suit", "YTA It's their house. Of course they check the cameras when they're away. Your wife is not your property. You were not harmed here. She knew there were cameras, she knew they'd be monitored, and she chose to swim and sunbathe knowing that. She's fine with it. What's your problem?", "Yta how is your family looking out for your wife taken this way?", "YTA\n\nIts your parents house, they have every right to check the cameras while they are away. Your wife is the one who chose to lay out nude while at their house. \n\nYour parents were trying to do her a favor by giving you a heads up that the pool guy was coming over. They could have just let the situation unfold as it would.\n\nSo yeah, calling out your parents was an AHole thing to do.", "NTA because you didn't flip out on your parents - you did a gentle push back and said it was odd - that seems fair. Had you said FU DAD then I'd be like - but you know there are cameras lol seems like you guys have a great relationship and Jenny is THE GOAT for being comfortable enough to swim naked, not give 2 shts about who sees, and being a complete honest sweetheart to you - you got a great wife, and great parents bro- congrats - you win at life", "Lol what an unexpected answer from your wife, well if she's ok with it nothing you can do, just next time you go over watch out for the cameras and don't stay naked infront of them since you are against it. Smth tells me your parents informed her of the cameras. YTA.", "YTA its their home, they have camera's that are going to be seen.  You dad wasn't pervying on your wife to get his rocks off, he checked because the pool guy was coming, saw your wife was in a compromising situation and let you know about it.  He probably didn't call your wife in case she got embarrassed or felt violated so called you instead.  Your wife isn't offended or even phased so why are you in such a tissy about fuck all?", "YTA\n\nYou know they have cameras. And you ***had*** to know they'd check them while they were gone, whether you were there or not.", "soft YTA, I think I would\u2019ve just laughed it off and thanked your dad. I would hope they just happened to check the house cameras, especially to check on the dog, and saw. If Jenny herself is unbothered, apologize to your parents and thank them for the heads up, make it a funny memory you guys can look back on and laugh about!", "YTA - It's their house. They weren't spying. She is not upset or uncomfortable, so why are you?", "Did your parents let you know that they might check the cameras beforehand?", "NTA\n\nSounds like no one is really bothered except you. So no harm, no foul. \n\nBut I would definitely feel like an intruder if I were to have a couple staying in my home and then check the cameras. Especially a couple with no kids.", "NTA. If someone's going to be watching you through security cameras, they ought to let you know that ahead of time. Likely, your wife would have been happy to wear a swimsuit if she knew.\n\nI also don't know a legitimate reason they would be checking  the cameras if you're housesitting. The point of having housesitters is that you watch for anything suspicious so they don't have to. Unless they thought your wife was out, why would they check? It could be they're just paranoid, but it kind of smells like they thought your wife was the suspicious person and wanted to catch her in something. I wonder where else they have cameras they aren't telling you about.", "YTA - It sounds like OP is embarrassed of his wife or something. Parents checked pool to see if there's anything they need to alert pool guy about and saw wife, and texted son to give her the heads up to remind wife it's pool cleaning day. Wife was aware of the camera and felt comfortable enough with parents knowing that it's there. If both parents & wife are ok with it,  why does OP feel the need to be concerned?", "You don\u2019t get privacy to act like someone else\u2019s house is yours .yta and you guys should know they have cameras", "Yes you are the only one.", "Yeah they didn\u2019t seem to mind and neither did Jenny, which seems kind of odd.", "Very clear, no doubt they could see it was her, she was nude, etc.", "Ok, thank you.", "I agree with you hahah! I also commented saging I find it weird", "Yep. She does not seem to care!", "They weren\u2019t peeping at the house sitter? They were checking their cameras which they are aloud to do. They could\u2019ve checked it multiple times throughout the son and dil were there and no one would\u2019ve known. It\u2019s not invasive to check on the property you own and reside at.", "Yeah I feel like a prude, but this feels like a privacy thing.", "Ok, you and others have put it into a better perspective. Thanks.", "Sounds like they were outside cameras. Totally normal to check. I even check them when I know my family is home to see who is over based on cars. It isn't like it was in the bathroom or bedroom or even inside", "I know they have cameras yes.", "Thanks. I\u2019m starting to see that now.", "Yes, definitely not creepy.", "We were generally aware of the cameras, not that they were checking.", "I guess I should think about that. Feeling protective maybe.", "I guess I feel like it was an invasion of privacy.", "Ok thanks. That\u2019s the thing, she\u2019s not upset. It\u2019s like I\u2019m in an upside down world or something.", "Why is it gross? I don't see anything wrong with it, as long as she doesn't mind getting others seeing her. She didn't mind and the parents didn't mind, so I'm not seeing the problem here.", "It\u2019s a private space and she was alone. Nudity is not gross.", "Right! Everyone has cameras these days . Especially outside. Seams odd that she would just go over there and be naked. To each their own I guess. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Gross as in, it\u2019s not her place to do so. It\u2019s her in-laws and you just never know what\u2019s gonna happen and here is a perfect example of it going left. Live ur life nudity and all!! Just don\u2019t get upset for the owners checking in on their home.", "Ok thanks for your input. I don\u2019t think the swimming thing is a weird part.", "You\u2019re probably right. I guess there are worse things.", "Yeah, I guess I\u2019m glad.", "Fair, thanks.", "Yeah, fair.", "Ok, thanks for saying that. I\u2019m feeling protective, maybe for no reason.", "NTA. Parents are obviously allowed to have cameras in their home, but OP and wife should've absolutely been made aware of that.", "That\u2019s fair. I\u2019m starting to see it this way. I guess my wife could have prevented this whole thing.", "Can I ask you a follow up question, if you\u2019re ok messaging me?", "Wow, thanks for that! Hadn\u2019t thought about her in that light.", "What do you mean, they informed her?", "Hadn\u2019t thought about that - he prob didn\u2019t want to call her directly.", "Fair, but my wife wasn\u2019t so sure.", "Fair! Yes she is not bothered, she even thinks it\u2019s funny.", "Fair! I don\u2019t know, and I\u2019m a bit surprised she\u2019s not uncomfortable.", "You\u2019re NAH. You\u2019re housesitting, it\u2019s your parents house not your friend\u2019s or a client\u2019s. Jenny is allowed to take a dip. I\u2019m honestly more weirded out that your parents weren\u2019t like \u201cJenny\u2019s out back naked, pool guy is coming tell her to cover up\u201d.", "This is the big kicker.  Did OP even KNOW there were cameras?      \n      \nDad's spying on y'all, no way around it and it's creepy.", "Not specifically no, but I guess I am aware they check them.", "Why do they have too? Its literally their home. Especially since they know this was the day that the pool guy was going to come over of course they're going to be checking their cameras at their home.", "They aren\u2019t suspicious people, but I see your point.", "All fair. I am definitely the only one who feels weird.", "Why\u2019s that odd they accidentally saw her naked. Ever walk in on someone using the bathroom. Yeah it\u2019s a little awkward but that\u2019s it.", "Wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not traumatizing to look at, and they have seen a woman before.", "I didn\u2019t say they weren\u2019t allowed, I said I found it weird that they peeped at their family that was staying in the house on purpose to watch it for them.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t spy on my family if they were watching my cat. You do you.", "Oh ok, fair enough. Yeah I thought they were outside given the pool situation....but I just didn't get why the parents still checked up on the house when they knew it was being looked after already. Just seems a bit creepy...especially given this particular situation where the dad caught his daughter in law naked by the pool.", "YTA. You knew they were there, they have every right to check them. Kinda on your wife not to parade around naked in front of the cameras if she doesn\u2019t want to get seen.", "Also it was both your parents, it's not like your dad was being weird about it. Just one of those silly accidents that happen.", "Then I think your parents owe you guys a big apology.", "Protective over what? It\u2019s your parents that happened to see your wife naked if you really think they would have ill intentions towards your wife or would do anything with this footage then you shouldn\u2019t be around them.", "Invasion of privacy to check on their own house???   I don\u2019t see it", "I\u2019d be worried about it if he didn\u2019t say anything, just have a laugh about this and move on, no. Else is upset about it", "Well, she probably just doesn't feel that self conscious. Since she was willing to go skinny dipping in someone else's pool in the middle of the day, she likely understood the risk she was taking. I don't see any problem here other than you getting unwarrantedly upset.", "The problem isn't the cameras, the problem is they didn't tell you before hand. I'm sure your wife wouldn't have gotten naked if that was the case, your parents are TA for not mentioning cameras.", "She knew. Read the post.", "Means you and her were aware they had cameras before she got nude. And she was well aware her nudity would be on camera.", "She probably just is grateful it was your parents and not the pool guy who saw her. She knows your mom and dad aren't checking her out.", "nah OP says they both knew the cameras were there", "Thank you so much for saying this. I was beginning to think I was losing my mind.", "You\u2019re making too much sense, lol.", "That\u2019s all fair, and she said she does not care.", "\u2026.that is in no way comparable at all. It\u2019s their house. Just because they have people staying at their house, that doesn\u2019t mean those very people are staying that vigilant. As cute as it is, a cat and an estate are two situations entirely.\n\nIn any case, they absolutely did her a favor. I find it weird that OP knew the house had cameras and didn\u2019t inform his wife, because it sounds like this wasn\u2019t the first time.", "Yeah she could have prevented this.", "Yeah. It\u2019s just a little weird that now they have seen her. I had thought she was just topless, but no.", "Fair! I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s hard to articulate.", "It's an invasion of privacy when you asked loved ones to do you the favor of housesitting for you then spy on them at random moments, yes.", "I could be wrong but I think OP didn't know there were cameras before hand. I think that it would make me uncomfortable to find out after being there for awhile. So, if this is how OP found out I would say that the real offence is not informing them about how private it would be before they agreed to, and started, watching the house for them.\nETA...just saw more comments saying OP knew about the cameras, so, nvrmnd what I wrote above. Now I just think OP is uncomfortable with nudity and anyone else seeing his wife naked...which has zero to do with anyone but OP. Good luck getting over your insecurities, OP.", "Ok, fair.", "Fair! It\u2019s true, it seems to be only me.", "Ok, that\u2019s fair. Yes, she\u2019s not self conscious in a private setting like that, and she said \u201cthey\u2019ve seen a naked woman before.\u201d I don\u2019t know, I guess I see your point.", "Fair!", "The OP is saying they knew there were cameras, but not that the ILs were checking the cameras. There's a difference.", "I don\u2019t think she was showing off.", "Yeah she for sure was glad to get the warning. She texted them.", "Knowing the cameras are there and knowing that people are just randomly checking the cameras are two different things.", "I may be an outlier, I don\u2019t think nudity is a big deal. Clearly your wife doesn\u2019t mind, so I\u2019d be satisfied with that.", "But she\u2019s also not upset about it, so maybe just chill out?", "If you can\u2019t articulate why you had such a problem with it then you should definitely just let the situation go and move on.", "They weren\u2019t peeping in the bedroom or bathroom.  They were looking outdoors, in the backyard.  Out in the open.   Nothing wrong with checking to see if there are predators lurking around the property\u2026beyond the eyes of house sitters.", "That\u2019s reasonable.  But if the wife isn\u2019t upset about it and figured it to be true, he should let it go.   Also how could he not see the cameras?   They\u2019re very easy to detect.  Especially outdoor ones.", "I don\u2019t think so either. She had no way of knowing if they would check them or not. But she was aware it was a possibility. She didn\u2019t care. Your parents didn\u2019t care. So not a big deal. Maybe next time just have her let your parents know she\u2019s going to be laying out nude so it doesn\u2019t happen again", "She wasn't, but she was aware of cameras and just didn't care.", "I would've been glad too. The pool guy would've been ogling. Your parents were probably checking to see where the dog was so the pool guy wasn't surprised by it.", "Fair. I\u2019m trying.", "Yep. Trying.", "Oh yeah. The predators. I forgot. The lurking predators.", "Yeah they have made clear they weren\u2019t upset about her layout like that, and that she shouldn\u2019t feel bad. So maybe a heads up will work.", "That\u2019s true, I guess.", "Ha, you know, that\u2019s totally possible. And yeah, pool guy would have got an eyeful.", "Would the alternative been better?  If parents didn't check the cameras and warn OP, then the pool boy could have gotten a free show.   \n\n\nAnd if the pool boy didn't appreciate the show, he would probably have decent grounds to file for sexual harassment.", "This will just be a funny story in a few years.", "Thanks for your input, but that last sentence was incredibly stupid.", "Looking forward to that!"]}
