It may be an easier trade off", "Nah, NTA. If she doesn't want to wear a bra at an official event, she needs to choose the dress that allows it. If she chose the dress that is tight fit, thin, see through or with noticable cleavage - she needs to wear a bra. \n\nNoone wants their sis to flash her tits during their wedding", "NTA\n\nWearing a bra for a few hours is not the end of the world. Plus, I bet she\u2019ll have more fun if she\u2019s not having to worry about accidentally letting a nip slip during the vows!!", "NTA.\n\nI avoid wearing bras a LOT. It started when I had back/shoulder pain (plus working in the home most of the time), and I got used to no bra. I have a daughter who also hates bras and lives in lose t-shirts most of the time. I support her. BUT...\n\nI've taught her that there are certain clothes and certain events that require a bra. We spent money finding the most comfortable bras we could find. Weddings are definitely one of those events we wear bras for. Although we both avoid tops/dresses that require a bra for everyday wear, if we choose to wear something that needs a bra, then we wear it.\n\nSister can think that you are being sexist for wanting her to wear a bra, but she could have also hated the colors of your wedding outfits. This is not the same as when the bride tells her bridesmaid to cut her long hair (or a recent one where the bride expected her bridesmaids to wear a bikini to the bachelorette party!!!). This is a very reasonable request. She really should choose to support you and wear a bra for that day, but that is a conclusion she has to come to on her own.\n\nI think you are also right to not exclude her over it, but you may choose to keep her in the back of the formal group photos. In advance of the wedding, you may suggest that she keep a bra with her clothes at the wedding/reception venue - just in case she changes her mind at the last minute. Or maybe you could offer the opportunity to change into something less in need of a bra as soon as the wedding and formal pictures are taken. You've already offered a lot of ways to be supportive of making her wear a bra as painless as possible. It would be nice if she found one or two of them tolerable enough to support you on your wedding day. But if she doesn't, please don't spend a moment of your day thinking about it.", "NTA. Part of going to a wedding is dressing appropriately. If she's one wrong move from a nip-slip, she's not dressed appropriately.

A wedding isn't the time or place. She should comply with this 1 request. Wear a bra or some type of covering over the dress for the ceremony and then she could even change into something else for the reception. You're really not asking much here.", "Are there any contingencies you could find?\nExtra padding, adding built in support to the dress, like those rubbery strips that try to help against slipping?", "How about titty tape or something similar.

If she's happy to spend the majority of her life without one on in order to enjoy the freedom of feeling comfortable, more power to her, that's great. Wish I had her confidence. But there are moments in life, like it or not, that it's just not appropriate, nor practical. A wedding is one of those times. Especially if wearing a tight fitting, revealing outfit. Again, great for her, but wear a bra. How humiliating would it be (for her) if one popped out when she's dancing? How uncomfortable for everyone else? Women included. It's not patriarchy or misogyny, or sexism. It's no different than knowing not to turn up in jeans, combat boots and a white, flowing veil. Just for one day. For a few short hours. For you. Surely it's not that much of a sacrifice?", "NTA it's one day. I had the opposite experience where I had to go braless to suit a bridesmaid dress, and I have huge boobs and was so uncomfortable. I got a couple of those sticky cups but there's only so much glorified tape can do. I hated it, but it was one day for someone I love, so I smiled and got on with it because that's life.", "NTA. There is a time and place for everything. Just bc you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. She can put a bra on for your wedding.", "NTA OP.  I can kinda understand your sister\u2019s reluctance to wear a bra, especially if she\u2019s that well endowed, because us well endowed women tend to have issues with what I\u2019ve heard referred to as Mall Bra Syndrome: you get a bra that looks like it\u2019s going to fit, but then it pinches or chafes, and you end up not wearing it at all.\n\nThat being said, if you can find a place that actually does fittings and won\u2019t break your budget, then you might want to consider taking her there and getting her properly fitted.  The last thing you need at your wedding is a wardrobe malfunction, and if she doesn\u2019t understand that, then perhaps she shouldn\u2019t be in the wedding party.", "NTA. Your sister can set aside her socio-political views about the wearing of bras for 3-4 hours, however long it takes for your wedding and reception. Wearing a bra for convention or aesthetic reasons is not a great hardship.\n\nBut if you do not plan to bar her from the wedding if she doesn't wear a bra, the issue seems moot.", "Try r/ABraThatFits they can help with bra sizing, if she doesn\u2019t like bras maybe boob tape?", "Going NAH. I think you are allowed to want your wedding party to look a certain way. I think they are allowed to respectfully reject things that will make them extremely uncomfortable. \n\nNow it is just a decision on your end if this is enough to have her sit out the wedding party duties or if you want to keep working with her in a resolution that works for both of you.", "I'm going to lean towards NTA because I do sympathize with your situation, however I feel as if maybe you could more easily reach a compromise?\n\nLike, if the dress is so low cut or whatever that her tiddy could pop up at any time, maybe have her wear pasties? Some people suggested body tape too (tape seems like it'd be kind of an uncomfortable solution comparatively, but I'm not a girl, so I can't say for sure).\n\nI think one of the key points, and what might make YTA, is if you brought this up or not when you told her she could pick her dress. Like if you said she could pick her dress and gave her few guidelines, then I think it's kinda unfair that she now has to worry about rules that weren't said before. If you did mention your concern, and she picked the dress she did anyway, then I think you have more of a case.\n\nHowever, in the real world, being an asshole isn't always about who \"is factually right\", and I think you should focus more on compromises to where you can hopefully both get what you want.", "NTA\n\nIf she's going to be part of the wedding party, its fair to have some sort of uniform that includes wearing under garments to camouflage one's privates..\n\nHowever, if she's going to be nothing more than a guest, then she should be held to the same general dress-code expectations as your other guests.  Do you plan on telling every guest who is woman to wear a bra?", "Yta going on a wild assumption that your sister doesn't want to flash everybody at your wedding. She knows her body better than you, if she doesn't think it is a problem then it probably isn't. There is so much pearl clutching about breast. There is nothing inappropriate about the natural shape and movement of a breast.", "NTA. Formal wear is often uncomfortable, e.g., high heels, suits, neck ties, etc., but we wear it for the occasion not for the rest of our lives.\n\nWearing a bra for a couple of hours won't kill her. And nothing ruins a nice outfit like huge sagging tits. Take a before/after pic of the outfit with/without a bra and show her the difference it'll make in the official photos.", "YTA. She's a grown woman and she can make her own choices about what she wears. She can see how she looks, she's had this body her whole adult life, she knows what she can and cant do in different garments. Even if the local boutique carries her size, the bras there might not suit the dress,  or pinch and dig in. Let her live!", "NAH.  Find a middle ground and get her something else underneath that will protect her from accidentally flashing your guests.", "NAH\n\nIs your sister in the wedding party?  If she is then you'd be N T A to request that she wear a bra.  But if she isn't then it's not something you need to worry about.\n\nBras are not very comfortable for some people.  If your sister doesn't want to wear one then it's on her.\n\nIf she does flash her boobs on the dance floor, perhaps no one is really going to care - it's not going to make the front page of the local news papaer.  They likely will pull her up and say it's not a good look but is it really going to be the talking point of the wedding?  Your family already know your sister doesn't wear a bra.. it's not going to be a surprise.  The only person that's going to be embarrassed is your sister and that's on her.  It's not a reflection on you.  If someone comments that you should've made her wear something different, ask them if they would be happy to wear suspenders and a revealing bra if you said that's what you wanted them to wear?\n\nA single comment along the lines of needing to perhaps wear or bra or pick something where she won't be flashing anyone and then leave it, will probably go further than constant nagging which makes some people dig their heels in to wear what you know is going to be an issue for them.. .just to prove a point.", "I mean my sister in law fell out at my brother in law\u2019s wedding, similar circumstances", "Maybe nipple covers? If she hates bras so much.", "NTA as you offered to pay for whatever she needs. Other options are trying to find a dress that doesn't need a bra, has padding built in, pasties and boob tape, or compromise and ask her to wear one during the ceremony and pictures and she can take if off after dinner.", "NTA. I had this issue with my bridesmaids dress for my best friends wedding. Had to go find a lil tube top to wear underneath too so I didn't look like I was a standby wet nurse for any new mothers present just ready to whip my boobs out at a seconds notice.

It\u2019s along the line of asking a guy to wear a tie and/or sports coat.\n\nThere are clothes that aren\u2019t super comfy, and clothes some people don\u2019t feel that they match too well with.  But at certain events we all suck it up and dress up a bit, even if it\u2019s not our favorite thing to wear.\n\nEspecially for those we love.  My brother could have asked me to wear a clown suit at his wedding, and I would have, even if I was cranky on the inside about it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA I personally dislike bras but I'm aware that certain clothing and situations require me to wear one. What  I wear round the house isn't the same as a revealing dress outside it. All you are asking is that she doesn't embarrass herself and everyone around her. No one wants to see her tits make an appearance at your wedding. She can fly the anti bra flag in a more appropriate setting", "NAH... but why are you insisting on a *bra\" specifically? There are many other options to keep a dress in place that isnt potentially painful. Wanting her to stay covered at your event is totally reasonable, but bras aren't the only way to ensure that and you might save yourself a lot of stress and conflict if you just insist on fabric tape to prevent wardrobe malfunctions.", "INFO: Why does it \"look bad\"?

A lot are actively painful even when \"they fit\".", "Yeah I accidentally typed decentexposure instead of decentexposures and I went back to change it but it still sent me to the first one, so I deleted it but now there's no link, I don't know WTF I am sorry.", "i don\u2019t know my size in america but it\u2019s like just below average i think so easier for me to find bras. it also depends on where you\u2019re shopping because if she\u2019s wearing it for a few hours it does not have to be the most comfortable thing in the world", "Okay, so when discussing this woman's breast size, what measurement do you suggest we use?", "To be clear, when i say \"putting on a show\" I'm cheekily referring to a \"nip slip\", which is where we as a society draw the line between dressed and undressed for the breastified among us.\n\nThis isn't a debate sub so lets leave aside the conversation about whether society *should* be female nipple averse, and just accept that, for as long as it os, we should avoid letting our nipples out on the dance floor of our sisters' weddings.", "Just because you don't see it, doesn't mean it doesn't happen. Especially when someone isn't wearing a bra with a dress that's meant to be worn with one.", "I agree that general bra education needs to improve. But even without band size a DDD won't look giant - unless in isolation. If you take a 30DDD and a 40DDD bra beside each other, the 40 will be noticeably larger.\n\nBut when you see them on a person, where boobs generally live, they don't seem gigantic because the whole torso is larger. It's proportional. Who the hell is it out there getting their info from what lingerie cups look like rather than breasts on bodies?! We should find them and bury them in old elastic.", "Someone that worked in a hospital once told me insurance is more likely to approve the breast reduction surgery if it causes frequent yeast infections under the breasts. Which is ridiculous they see that as more important than back pain. But may be worth a shot for you to try.", "Something I don't understand about bodies is that for me, at 32GG/H, it's the not wearing one that's more painful unless my movement level is approximately zero. The straps and band can dig in, but that's it's painful than the pain of the actual boob if I move around without a bra. So anything that involves leaving my house will involve wearing a bra because not wearing one is too painful, regardless of any visual aspect. Sometimes it's less painful than a bad bra, but that just means I need a better one.", "I'd honestly look at changing insurance carriers if that's in the cards.  My wife was far smaller than you (36G before, 34D after) and got hers approved instantly after a single consult, and hers were at largest around 5lbs a piece.  We're on Cigna FWIW.\n\nIf you have 70lbs worth of boobs you're probably just shy of the Guinness Book of World Records, and it's downright criminal you can't get your insurer to approve.", "Have you tried a corset?", "In America, only standard sizes are available up to 40DD. I\u2019m a 36F. I have to be properly fitted and then my bra has to be ordered. I can\u2019t just walk in anywhere and buy a bra.", "Combination of cup AND band", "What don't people understand about 'IT'S FINE TO DISAGREE '. Stop trying to convince me and carry on", "Here's what a correctly fitted [42DD looks like](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPL12dGHtAU/?igshid=NzZhOTFlYzFmZQ==). A 40DDD is the same breast volume on a slightly smaller person, if you sister size down one band, you go up one cup", "congratulations? we dont know the size of this woman\u2019s breasts so we can\u2019t accurately judge if she can buy a standard size or not.", "Saying it's fine if we disagree isn't an end all like you'd like it to be. You are on the internet.", "He said she\u2019s well endowed, so not small."]}
