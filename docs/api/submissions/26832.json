When she's wearing certain items like baggy t-shirts it's not so noticeable but in the dress (that she chose, I just gave her a color) she's wearing in my wedding it will very very obvious she's not wearing a bra and one wrong move and she could be flashing everyone. Not only does it look bad, but it's also borderline inappropriate. \n\nI told her let's go shopping and she can try a bunch of different ones, I even found a boutique in our area because stores carry very few options in her size and said I'd pay for whatever she picked out. \n\nNow she's saying I'm playing into sexist stereotypes. I'm saying that there's a good chance if you dance too hard in this dress your titty is going to pop out and I don't think thats sexist. \n\nAITA \n\nEdit: I thought I added this in already but somehow then deleted it? \n\nThe dress has a low cut made with two panels that criss cross. It is too tight so the panels her boobs \"in half\" if that makes sense with half exposed and half not,  and when she walks in the dress her boobs shift towards the exposed  center so that she is constantly pulling the material back over and tucking them in.\n\nAlso, it's not about my sisters cleavage looking better then mine. She's my sister, I want her to look fantastic. I'm going to be wearing a thirty pound bright white dress, I'm not worried about people not seeing me. \n\nIf she had smaller boobs it wouldn't be an issue with this dress. If she had small boobs and was wearing a dress that could expose said smaller breasts I would still have an issue. \n\nIf a man were to come to my wedding with his nipples exposed he would be kicked out. I'm not into the frat bro take off your shirt and wear your tie around your head, it's not happening either. \n\nI'm all for topless beaches. I'm not for topless weddings. To everyone saying \"well in Europe\", please point me to a European country where it is considered normal for European women to attend a wedding with her boobs out. \n\nThank you for everyone's suggestions.\n\nETA 2: I have decided I am just going to leave it alone.", "created_utc": 1694673642, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16iazil/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_is_required_to/", "score": 6468, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It may be an easier trade off", "Nah, NTA. If she doesn't want to wear a bra at an official event, she needs to choose the dress that allows it. If she chose the dress that is tight fit, thin, see through or with noticable cleavage - she needs to wear a bra. \n\nNoone wants their sis to flash her tits during their wedding", "NTA\n\nWearing a bra for a few hours is not the end of the world. Plus, I bet she\u2019ll have more fun if she\u2019s not having to worry about accidentally letting a nip slip during the vows!!", "NTA.\n\nI avoid wearing bras a LOT. It started when I had back/shoulder pain (plus working in the home most of the time), and I got used to no bra. I have a daughter who also hates bras and lives in lose t-shirts most of the time. I support her. BUT...\n\nI've taught her that there are certain clothes and certain events that require a bra. We spent money finding the most comfortable bras we could find. Weddings are definitely one of those events we wear bras for. Although we both avoid tops/dresses that require a bra for everyday wear, if we choose to wear something that needs a bra, then we wear it.\n\nSister can think that you are being sexist for wanting her to wear a bra, but she could have also hated the colors of your wedding outfits. This is not the same as when the bride tells her bridesmaid to cut her long hair (or a recent one where the bride expected her bridesmaids to wear a bikini to the bachelorette party!!!). This is a very reasonable request. She really should choose to support you and wear a bra for that day, but that is a conclusion she has to come to on her own.\n\nI think you are also right to not exclude her over it, but you may choose to keep her in the back of the formal group photos. In advance of the wedding, you may suggest that she keep a bra with her clothes at the wedding/reception venue - just in case she changes her mind at the last minute. Or maybe you could offer the opportunity to change into something less in need of a bra as soon as the wedding and formal pictures are taken. You've already offered a lot of ways to be supportive of making her wear a bra as painless as possible. It would be nice if she found one or two of them tolerable enough to support you on your wedding day. But if she doesn't, please don't spend a moment of your day thinking about it.", "NTA. Part of going to a wedding is dressing appropriately. If she's one wrong move from a nip-slip, she's not dressed appropriately. I say this as someone who hasn't worn a bra in years and physically can't stand it.\n\nThere are other options, like stick on bras or tape that she might look into, or maybe she needs a different dress, but she can't do nothing.", "NTA.\n\nThere's a time and place to make the whole anti-bra, sexism statements. A wedding isn't the time or place. She should comply with this 1 request. Wear a bra or some type of covering over the dress for the ceremony and then she could even change into something else for the reception. You're really not asking much here.", "Are there any contingencies you could find?\nExtra padding, adding built in support to the dress, like those rubbery strips that try to help against slipping?", "How about titty tape or something similar.  To subdue those boobies into submission if she doesn't like bras.", "NTA", "NTA - You are being more than accommodating of her, she could have the good grace to also be accommodating to you too. This is a formal event, no place for her to be making a statement about politics.", "NTA I also hate bras but sometimes they are necessary", "As a larger woman who hates wearing bras... NTA. If she's happy to spend the majority of her life without one on in order to enjoy the freedom of feeling comfortable, more power to her, that's great. Wish I had her confidence. But there are moments in life, like it or not, that it's just not appropriate, nor practical. A wedding is one of those times. Especially if wearing a tight fitting, revealing outfit. Again, great for her, but wear a bra. How humiliating would it be (for her) if one popped out when she's dancing? How uncomfortable for everyone else? Women included. It's not patriarchy or misogyny, or sexism. It's no different than knowing not to turn up in jeans, combat boots and a white, flowing veil. Just for one day. For a few short hours. For you. Surely it's not that much of a sacrifice?", "NTA it's one day. I had the opposite experience where I had to go braless to suit a bridesmaid dress, and I have huge boobs and was so uncomfortable. I got a couple of those sticky cups but there's only so much glorified tape can do. I hated it, but it was one day for someone I love, so I smiled and got on with it because that's life.", "NTA. There is a time and place for everything. Just bc you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. She can put a bra on for your wedding.", "NTA OP.  I can kinda understand your sister\u2019s reluctance to wear a bra, especially if she\u2019s that well endowed, because us well endowed women tend to have issues with what I\u2019ve heard referred to as Mall Bra Syndrome: you get a bra that looks like it\u2019s going to fit, but then it pinches or chafes, and you end up not wearing it at all.\n\nThat being said, if you can find a place that actually does fittings and won\u2019t break your budget, then you might want to consider taking her there and getting her properly fitted.  The last thing you need at your wedding is a wardrobe malfunction, and if she doesn\u2019t understand that, then perhaps she shouldn\u2019t be in the wedding party.", "NTA. Your sister can set aside her socio-political views about the wearing of bras for 3-4 hours, however long it takes for your wedding and reception. Wearing a bra for convention or aesthetic reasons is not a great hardship.\n\nBut if you do not plan to bar her from the wedding if she doesn't wear a bra, the issue seems moot.", "Try r/ABraThatFits they can help with bra sizing, if she doesn\u2019t like bras maybe boob tape?", "Going NAH. I think you are allowed to want your wedding party to look a certain way. I think they are allowed to respectfully reject things that will make them extremely uncomfortable. \n\nNow it is just a decision on your end if this is enough to have her sit out the wedding party duties or if you want to keep working with her in a resolution that works for both of you.", "I'm going to lean towards NTA because I do sympathize with your situation, however I feel as if maybe you could more easily reach a compromise?\n\nLike, if the dress is so low cut or whatever that her tiddy could pop up at any time, maybe have her wear pasties? Some people suggested body tape too (tape seems like it'd be kind of an uncomfortable solution comparatively, but I'm not a girl, so I can't say for sure).\n\nI think one of the key points, and what might make YTA, is if you brought this up or not when you told her she could pick her dress. Like if you said she could pick her dress and gave her few guidelines, then I think it's kinda unfair that she now has to worry about rules that weren't said before. If you did mention your concern, and she picked the dress she did anyway, then I think you have more of a case.\n\nHowever, in the real world, being an asshole isn't always about who \"is factually right\", and I think you should focus more on compromises to where you can hopefully both get what you want.", "NTA\n\nIf she's going to be part of the wedding party, its fair to have some sort of uniform that includes wearing under garments to camouflage one's privates..\n\nHowever, if she's going to be nothing more than a guest, then she should be held to the same general dress-code expectations as your other guests.  Do you plan on telling every guest who is woman to wear a bra?\n\n***EDIT***:  Let me clarify. OP shouldn't be telling his sister (who will probably not be the only large bosomed woman there) what to wear unless he tells everyone else that.  If she wears something risky and experiences a costume malfunction, then the logical consequences should apply.   But to single her out for special warnings ahead of time seems a bit heavy handed, unless she's in the wedding party -- which I am assuming that she is.", "Yta going on a wild assumption that your sister doesn't want to flash everybody at your wedding. She knows her body better than you, if she doesn't think it is a problem then it probably isn't. There is so much pearl clutching about breast. There is nothing inappropriate about the natural shape and movement of a breast.", "NTA. Formal wear is often uncomfortable, e.g., high heels, suits, neck ties, etc., but we wear it for the occasion not for the rest of our lives.\n\nWearing a bra for a couple of hours won't kill her. And nothing ruins a nice outfit like huge sagging tits. Take a before/after pic of the outfit with/without a bra and show her the difference it'll make in the official photos.", "YTA. She's a grown woman and she can make her own choices about what she wears. She can see how she looks, she's had this body her whole adult life, she knows what she can and cant do in different garments. Even if the local boutique carries her size, the bras there might not suit the dress,  or pinch and dig in. Let her live!", "NAH.  Find a middle ground and get her something else underneath that will protect her from accidentally flashing your guests.", "NAH\n\nIs your sister in the wedding party?  If she is then you'd be N T A to request that she wear a bra.  But if she isn't then it's not something you need to worry about.\n\nBras are not very comfortable for some people.  If your sister doesn't want to wear one then it's on her.\n\nIf she does flash her boobs on the dance floor, perhaps no one is really going to care - it's not going to make the front page of the local news papaer.  They likely will pull her up and say it's not a good look but is it really going to be the talking point of the wedding?  Your family already know your sister doesn't wear a bra.. it's not going to be a surprise.  The only person that's going to be embarrassed is your sister and that's on her.  It's not a reflection on you.  If someone comments that you should've made her wear something different, ask them if they would be happy to wear suspenders and a revealing bra if you said that's what you wanted them to wear?\n\nA single comment along the lines of needing to perhaps wear or bra or pick something where she won't be flashing anyone and then leave it, will probably go further than constant nagging which makes some people dig their heels in to wear what you know is going to be an issue for them.. .just to prove a point.", "I mean my sister in law fell out at my brother in law\u2019s wedding, similar circumstances", "Maybe nipple covers? If she hates bras so much.", "NTA as you offered to pay for whatever she needs.

I had this issue with my bridesmaids dress for my best friends wedding. Had to go find a lil tube top to wear underneath too so I didn't look like I was a standby wet nurse for any new mothers present just ready to whip my boobs out at a seconds notice. Nobody wants to unleash the tits at someone elses wedding. So like. If not a bra then something else to prevent rogue boobs??", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding.

But at certain events we all suck it up and dress up a bit, even if it\u2019s not our favorite thing to wear.\n\nEspecially for those we love.  My brother could have asked me to wear a clown suit at his wedding, and I would have, even if I was cranky on the inside about it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA I personally dislike bras but I'm aware that certain clothing and situations require me to wear one. What  I wear round the house isn't the same as a revealing dress outside it. All you are asking is that she doesn't embarrass herself and everyone around her. No one wants to see her tits make an appearance at your wedding. She can fly the anti bra flag in a more appropriate setting", "NAH... but why are you insisting on a *bra\" specifically? There are many other options to keep a dress in place that isnt potentially painful. Wanting her to stay covered at your event is totally reasonable, but bras aren't the only way to ensure that and you might save yourself a lot of stress and conflict if you just insist on fabric tape to prevent wardrobe malfunctions.", "INFO: Why does it \"look bad\"?

Big boobs and fibromyalgia is not a fun combo.\n\nGreat idea about the nipple covers, though. She could even wear the kind with tassels, just in case she pops out. It is a special occasion after all! /s\n\nNo but seriously, pasties might be an eminently workable compromise.", "It had thin straps so I thought I was okay......I was not. Never since. Now I go full security, even though said child is now 14 and his sister is 10. I had a boob monster too.", "Yepp, it totally depends on the bra. I wear f cups, and have some minimizer cups that I like because they are very good at restricting movement, and they push the breasts together a bit, but I have other styles too. One of them actually has like one to two fingers width of stiff material between the cups. Once I got the size and fit exactly right, it sits right against the breast bone and helps keep the breasts still and secure in the cups. Very good for most dresses.\n\nReally, sis should just go to someone who knows how to fit a bra, show them the dress, get measured, and let them tell her what bra she needs. If it's a good one, it won't be cheap, but it'll sit right and keep her boobs out of sight without making her feel restricted or uncomfortable in any way.", "There is literally no style of bra that would work under that dress for larger cup sizes, like any support you get in that dress you are getting from tape or the dress itself. Because that literally has a cut out where the band would be", "Was gonna say. I wear f cups, and I need a bra if I want to be able to move and stay decent. I never had trouble finding a formal dress that I can wear with a bra or a corsage. I never noticed the part about plus sizes not being sleevless, but then I just reached plus sized territory during the pandemic and haven't needed a new dress since then. I don't think I'll care all that much though. Finding a good strapless bra or corsage for those was always a bit of a hassle, and they are not cheap!", "Fair enough, that makes sense. Thank you!", "It is so heartbreaking to see people living in pain and telling others that\u2019s just how it is because the bra industry has convinced us some of our bodies are just wrong. r/ABraThatFits and finding birth control that worked for me have been the two greatest improvements in my quality of life as an adult. \n\nMeasure yourself, and take the time to do it right and shop for a bra that\u2019s made for your breasts, not anyone else\u2019s. I was once at Victoria\u2019s Secret for so long that 3 different employees measured me. They all gave me different sizes and none of them were right. I cannot stress enough: *do it yourself*.", "AHH!! They should really have removal instructions come in the box! You're supposed to slather the tape in baby oil to dissolve the adhesive before you remove it. I'm sorry that happened!", "Weird hill you chose to die on.", "The typical tuxedo outfit will easily cover the nipples tho. Loose shirt + possible vest + overcoat covers the chest 100%. So if she were wearing a tux, that argument would make sense, but a low cut dress is different.", "We tell them to wear suits and ties, even when it's really hot out. \n\nIt might not be equal between genders, but weddings have all sorts of arbitrary etiquette rules. I think bras are probably one of them.\n\nMore power to you if you want to ignore or protest the expectation, just not at someone else's wedding.", "It\u2019s not about the nipples sticking through the dress. It\u2019s about her possibly flashing everyone. The bride is being more than fair. Just find a way to make sure the titties aren\u2019t going to fall out. How is this any different than the bride picking a dress code?", "So you were flashing people at weddings? That\u2019s what OP is worried about. Her sister popping her boobs out while dancing.", "You're right bro. I'll just wear some silk pants and no underwear so my dick and balls are swangin back and forth like a grandfather clock whenever I move. Definitely appropriate, right?", "She isn't worried about undergarments', she's worried about indecent exposure.", "I would not want to be flashed at a wedding just saying as someone who does hate bras and prefers being braless. The sister isn't trying to police her body, but lowering the possibilities of an accident at her wedding.", "I disagree if the bride is going to display these family pics forever", "Then the sister can stay home", "Bras change your body shape. If the dress is cut for her breasts to be higher on the chest, that's how it's cut and that's how it's going to look the best. It sounds like the dress is a poor fit without the bra, making it inappropriate. If her breasts were sitting in the dress how they were designed to be placed, then the dress would be appropriate.", "I use KT tape, and it works okay. The problem is that I still need to go up over my shoulder for lift, so I still need some strap width on the dress to cover up the tape. But I've pulled off a deep plunge at 36G.", "This right here!  I would bet money that if someone describes their breasts as \"big\" and describes them as DD/DDD, especially with no band size for context, they are wearing a cup way too small.", "Thank you for bringing this to my attention.", "Thank you so much for recommending this sub! Unrelated to this parent post, but I\u2019m 30 weeks pregnant and having the hardest time finding comfortable, supportive bras with these body changes.", "I got mine from a lingerie shop. She had a small selection, but was able to order in a wide variety of sizes. There\u2019s also a corset shop in the City, but I haven\u2019t been there.\n\nIf you can afford to have one made, I\u2019ve found bridal shops often employ a corsettier. You can also find corsettiers online. I\u2019m currently saving to get one.", "The point of the boob tape is not to hold them up, but to let them hang wherever she is comfortable having them hang without flashing anyone.", "Im here for both, the last line vinyl sticker *and* the comfortable vinyl bra.", "I'll take two, 3 if I can get one in cousin instead of sister", "As a fellow bra hater, I'm ALL about the camis with built-ins. I can wear them under everything I feel comfortable wearing, and I'm never going back.", "Not, me, the bride. I assume bride and groom are to call shots at their wedding. But you can call shots at your own party, man)))", "I have whiplash which has a lot of similarities with fibro so I'm just smiling about how different we women are even when seemingly somewhat similar :) \n\nThe most important stuff is finding what works for us without making others' uncomfortable and there should be a possible solution for that. I've looked at the tape too and at least been curious but since I'm happy with my bras, haven't felt like testing it.", "Ah yes, the toddler pulling your bra down classic. My toddler tries this with my swim suit too! He generally thinks my neckline is a super convenient handhold", "This style is my go to when I feel like stirring shit up.", "Please name the two-finger brand! Signed, fat short double d pastor", "Oh my god, I've never heard of this bum glue, and now I'm obsessed. I do pole fitness/performance and the hollywood tape doesn't always keep everything in place! Thank you!", "Absolutely!", "It better be!!", "I was looking for a basic black cocktail dress with wide straps so I could wear a bra, and could wear it for various seasons, and a v or a scoop neck, because I hate high neck clothes. No luck! You either get the thin spaghetti straps which are obviously not possible with a real bra, or here comes the Mother of the Bride.", "Same I\u2019m a UK HH / US L and the only time my bras are uncomfortable is when I\u2019m in the wrong size. I wear a bra everyday almost all day. R/abrathatfits has a size calculator that will literally change your life if you follow it. Before using it I was wearing a US 44DDD. The calculator came back at. 38 US L / UK HH. I was floored then found brands like Elomi and Curvy Kate that sell larger cup sizes. I highly recommend them.", "I believe you. I have almost negative tits but every bra is painful because of an old thoracic spine injury. After about 30 minutes my arm is going numb. I use tape as an alternative but I'm allergic to it so it's agonizing either way.", "Hey my fellow EDSer! \n\nI'm not even that big, though I am a DD cup with waistband size fluctuating, but even with proper bra fitting I just can't wear them. I have issues with shoulders, ribs, neck and back so I haven't been able to wear a bra for 7 years now without getting an instant migraine no matter what type of bra I wear. The stick on  bras offer zero support since they don't make them past a D cup where I live, so on me they just hide the nips, and thanks to EDS skin I only wear them when I have to because of the unbearable itching and skin tears I end up with when I pull them off.\n\nI just don't wear bras at all now and I dress appropriately so that the girls stay hidden at all times. I have a couple dresses that I know would make me look *fantastic* if I wore a bra with them as the girls would be lifted and I'd have an actual cleavage, but the pain of a bra isn't worth it so I make them work as best I can without said bra - so saying that, they're the kind of dresses that even without a bra there's not going to be any view for anyone.", "Look at size guide on the product pages for Molke.  Their \"original\" bras use their own sizing scheme, because the fabric is soft and stretchy, but the measurements go up to the equivalent of a UK 54M.", "Exactly this.", "No I didn\u2019t use oil and I had no idea I was supposed to. Thanks for letting me know!! Now I won\u2019t be so scared to use it again", "That's a bummer! Good luck.", "For reference I am thumbtacks on drywall\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "My favourite one-piece swimming suit was like this. Wired, boned - beautiful :).", "Tape bras just impossible. You have to match the north/south of each (impossible) and then you have to match the east/west (forget it). Then the skin is taut as all boob weight hangs from skin under collarbone. Ouch. Bad, bad, bad.", "Yeah, in more ways than one, bras are not one size fits all.", "I mean, you cannot fault the logic. If you have them on your hip, which I had been doing for the photographs, it is exactly where they're little hands are going to be. Not to mention most dresses are either soft or and shiny.", "This! I have double Fs. I don't understand why these ladies don't want to wear bras. It would be like I have a couple of heavy cantaloupes hanging off my chest all night.  I wouldn't be able to dance or have any fun.", "A bit part of my issue is that my skin is too delicate. I end up with tears and infections from the breast pressing the elastic into my ribs hard enough to leave marks. But people seem offended by the idea that women don't have to wear stuff that makes them look a certain way!", "I made the same mistake! Those blisters were scary. Apparently any oil works, you just have to drench it.", "But can you cut a bra from vinyl?", "I have MS and bras are often straight up torture to my back, even soft or loose ones.", "Someone should!", "I have DDs (I am a tiny person though, so they feel bigger), and frankly I\u2019m at a point where I end up in pain with or without a bra, just in different places. There\u2019s days where I just deal with the back pain bc I physically cannot wear a bra any longer. I intend to get a breast reduction at some point and hopefully go down to like a B.", "I've recently been through lumpectomy surgery and 20 weeks of radiation (all is well now, BTW)....the only problem I've had is fluid collection and swelling on the surgical side and apparently the cause was because I didn't wear a supportive bra 21/7. I've gone bra-less for I don't know how many years; I've worn camisoles which have \"bralettes\" inserted so no nip exposure under my shirts. I'm not hugely endowed, and part of it is due to weight gain in my sixth decade...  Anyway, at one appointment a more empathetic nurse practitioner told me \"Larger-breasted women need more support so that all the whatever drains into the lymphatic system.\" I replied \"Y'know, I would've paid money to be described as 'large-breasted' back when I was in high school.\" Got a round of laughs and also instructions for lymphatic massage, which has helped my situation immensely without having to wear a restrictive bra while trying to sleep.", "Never thought about it like that.  I am a bra hater but i do require the spinal support.  So i can never leave home without it.", "*commiserates in JJ\n\nBras are absolute murder for my neck and shoulders but I need *some* support if I\u2019m actually leaving the house. And yeah, those tape thingies were a frustrating (though humorous in retrospect) and decidedly failed experiment. Do not recommend for the bustier among us.", "Feels you pain in G.  So glad I\u2019m an old now and no more bridesmaid dresses!  The B cup friends never understood", "> I have MS and bras are often straight up torture to my back, even soft or loose ones.\n\nI hear you, some of the comments here are so ableist.", "I\u2019d genuinely love to try corset out and save my poor ribs and shoulders. But I know that to have it fit properly, it\u2019s basically gotta be custom and that just ain\u2019t in my budget.", "I fall somewhere between H and I. What truly sucks about that is I'm a trans man and it is literally physically impossible for me to bind. I've done all the compression I could muster, deeply unsafe levels, and it still looks like boobs. These days I just wear the highest-compression sports bras I can find (Walmart has some surprisingly good ones) and try not to fuck up the Weird Rib any further.", "I'm so glad you found a healthcare provider who could help you! I'm a trans man so I simply plan to yeet mine entirely and honestly like. This is maybe 20% for trans reasons and 80% because I do not know what it's like to not have back and pectoral pain. I fall between H and I cups.", "Same. Like, do I LOVE bras? I mean, not really. But I can't really bring myself to hate them or not wear them either because the alternative is so much worse.", "If there's any Renaissance fairs in your area, they usually have a corsetier there that has all sorts of sizing beyond what you might find in a store for less than a custom one"]}
