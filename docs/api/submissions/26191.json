The baby was planned, we\u2019re both very happy about it, life is perfect. \n\nShe wanted to share the news with her family in person. Her family doesn\u2019t live close to us. She talks to them all the time but we rarely see them. I\u2019ve never had that awkward, cliche experience of her mom sitting down and showing me the embarrassing photos of her when she was younger. \n\nSo a week ago her parents came out here to visit on this was going to be the perfect time to announce the news. She told them, everyone was excited, things were great.\n\nLater that same day it was just the two of us and her mom and her mom started asking her about all of those things women talk about when a baby is coming, and one of those things was whether or not my wife plans to breastfeed. I already know the answer, she\u2019s planning to breastfeed. When she told her mom she was, her mom said \u201cCan you breastfeed even with the implants? How does it work?\u201d My head whipped around so fast. What implants? First time I\u2019ve heard about any implants. My wife\u2019s face said it all, eyes wide and silently shouting at her mom to be quiet.\n\nI\u2019m a completely monogamous person now, a totally faithful man, but prior to marriage I had touched my fair share of breasts and I\u2019ve always been able to spot the fakes. My own wife has fake boobs and I didn\u2019t know? I\u2019m telling you that they\u2019re very nice, amazing even, but they don\u2019t look or feel fake whatsoever. They\u2019re a normal size (very full C), feel soft and \u201cnatural\u201d to the touch, aren\u2019t unusually perky. I mean she was 20 when we met so perky boobs are expected to some extent. \n\nI wasn\u2019t going to let it go. As soon as we were alone I asked her about it. She admitted that yes she got implants when she was 18 because she was so flat and had no confidence because of it. It\u2019s not something she wants people to know about. Ok, but I\u2019m not just somebody. \n\nI asked her if she\u2019s had other work done, but wasn\u2019t expected her to say anything else. She told me she had a nose job too and her Cupid\u2019s bow reshaped. I\u2019ve seen pictures of her as a kid and a pre-teen but I realized in that that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen photos of her from probably age of 12-17 (she got the nose job at 17). She refuses to show me any pictures of what she looked like before these things.\n\nI called her a liar. She lied to me. She pretended that everything about her, except her hair color, was all natural. She\u2019s hurt that I called her a liar.\n\nAITA for calling my wife a liar for not divulging that she\u2019s had plastic surgery?", "created_utc": 1693841861, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/169v8n4/aita_for_calling_my_wife_a_liar_for_getting/", "score": 2377, "replies": ["#[Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).\r\n\r\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means.", ">and I\u2019ve always been able to spot the fakes.\n\nYou know that's not true right, because you didn't know about the ones you didn't spot?", "> prior to marriage I had touched my fair share of breasts and I\u2019ve always been able to spot the fakes.\n\nSure you did buddy. \n\nYTA", "What an extremely shallow and weird hill to die on.
