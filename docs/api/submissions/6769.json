They don't owe him anything. If anyone is owed a favor it is actual building owner. Op is not obligated to keep housing their ex because of a past favor and it is sick that so many people are telling them to unhouse themselves for his comfort, that they should be paying hotels for his random visits, and basically that they should fund them whenever and forever because dude asked his godfather one time for assistance. The godfather is the only one entitled to kickback for kindness, the weird consent ignoring ex does not.\n\nSeriously people, what kind of sick standard is that?
