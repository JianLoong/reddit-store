You don't need her permission to get naked with your friends and play at the beach.", "NAH. You're entitled to do what you want but she is entitled to feel uncomfortable about it. I personally would be upset if my significant other went to a nude beach without mentioning it beforehand. Her feelings of discomfort are valid because a nude beach can be seen as sexual. But on the flipside, if you don't make it sexual then you haven't technically done anything wrong.\n\nEdit:. I never said nude beaches are sexual, I said they can be SEEN as sexual by people that aren't familiar with them.", "NTA - you two seem to have different values, and that warrants a serious discussion.  But your body is your choice, and unless there is other evidence of cheating, it seems like you just had a fun day at the beach.  \n\nAs someone who has been to Wreck Beach many times, I can affirm that there is nothing particularly \u2018sexy\u2019 about group public nudity.  Maybe you have to be from Vancouver to get it, but as long as everyone involved is an adult, I see no issue with this.", "Info needed: Would you have been ok if she told you that she and a few of her girlfriends went to a nude beach all day? Would you have been positive no guys were there or would be ok with other people seeing her fully naked and frolicking around?\n\nNot asking if you would ok with her actually doing that, but would you have been ok with finding out after the fact?", "Personally, I think I\u2019d have more of an issue with my partner seeing other people naked than I would over someone seeing them naked, but boundaries are different for different people. You didn\u2019t go to the beach with the intent to look at other women. You went to have fun, enjoy the water and weed, and chill with your friends. There was no ill will at all in going. Sounds innocent enough to me. \n\nI understand why your girlfriend is upset. (Honestly, I might be too in her shoes.) You being naked in public is clearly a boundary for her. If that\u2019s the case, she needs to communicate that calmly instead of casting aspersions. She is definitely overreacting. The accusation that you \u201cborderline cheated\u201d by going to a nude beach is ludicrous, considering the activities you and your friends took part in. It reeks of a lack of trust. \n\nI was going to vote N A H because this superficially seems like a lack of communication over boundaries on her end and an innocent day out on yours, but her reaction is excessive and upsetting.

Her comments are obviously over the top, and they are definitely more of a her problem than a you problem. \n\nThat said, going to a nude beach is completely normal, but it\u2019s not common.

It\u2019s up to each couple to set their own limits in their relationship. \n\nI\u2019m not into nude beaches, I don\u2019t get the appeal at all, and if she\u2019s never been to one I can understand why she feels weird about it. \n\nRegardless, now you know how she feels about it and it\u2019s up to you to decide if this is a boundary you\u2019re comfortable with or not.", "NTA\n\nThere's nothing sexual about a nude beach and her saying YOUR body belongs to her is a HUGE red flag. \n\nIdk how long you've been with her, OP, but I would definitely take a look at your relationship and see what other weird things you may have overlooked in the past.", "IDK \n\nI would be mad if my significant other went to a nude beach. \n\nHowever if you didn't mess around with any girls then  I wouldn't be as mad.", ">no one had the right to see my body but her.\n\nWtf... no. It's YOUR body, not a possession of hers to control... \n\nNTA, without a conversation about going to nude beaches beforehand, there was no way for you to know she would be that opposed to it. Generally, going anywhere where people are completely or mostly nude should warrant a conversation beforehand, like a strip club for example, but a nude beach is way different than a strip club. Yea some creeps go to nude beaches to, well... creep.. on other people but a very very large majority of people are there to just.. be naked on the beach, it's not a sexual thing. And definitely not \"borderline cheating\" because of that.", "NTA, a nude beach is not a sex club/orgy. Sexualizing nudity in itself is a different mentality.", "NTA, though obviously you and your girlfriend have  different ideas about nudity that may become an issue down the road depending on how much you enjoy the naturalist lifestyle. This is a great opportunity to have that discussion to find out if you can reach a compromise (you get to do your thing without facing censure, you won't insist she join you).", "NTA. you\u2019re the sole owner of your body and theres nothing wrong with the nude form. HOWEVER, with that being said, not initially telling her is probably what mostly caused her to freak out. it may have made her feel like you hid it from her intentionally since you only told her afterwards, which is likely why she\u2019s worried about cheating.", "NTA.  Nude beaches aren't my thing, and I can understand her being a little squicked out by it, but I think \"borderline cheated\" is an overreaction.", "Not the asshole.\n\nI can see why she would be a little weirded out about you going to a nude beach, but she took it to an accusatory level and claimed that you were cheating on her when all you did was hang out with your friends who are all male (that is if I'm to assume that you are heterosexual). She may be insecure due to past relationships going under because of infidelity on the part of her past partner(s), but there is not enough info there to make that clear. I would suggest having more clear and direct communication with your gf moving forward and avoiding the nude beach just to be safe.", "I\u2019d have to say conditional NTA, as some stuff sounds petty.\n\nIf you\u2019d be okay with her coming up to you and saying \u201cGuess what! We all [insert exact same scenario but flipped],\u201d then I\u2019d deem you not the asshole.\n\nIf you\u2019d be angry with her for behaving as you have behaved but in reverse, I take back my N T A.\n\nIt\u2019s not a matter of asking permission; it\u2019s a matter of respecting whatever standard the two of you have established as being defined as respecting the monogamy of your relationship while also respecting the individuality of your selves.", "Red flag about the comment, she's the only one allowed to see you naked. Interesting that she jumped to the part about you going with girls.. Trust and control issues going on there.\nAs you said it was a spur of the moment thing and didn't think anything of it. I guess now that you know how she feels about it. This will be one of many things she will have control over. How comfortable are you in having your life controled by your gf. She doesn't trust you and will be controling you if you allow her.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but it should have been discussed to give her time to consider it. My husband would never go to a strip club because I don\u2019t want him watching real life women be sexualized in person. But a nude beach is different. It isn\u2019t about sex. It\u2019s about being bare in nature. He doesn\u2019t know this because it\u2019s never come up but we do agree than we will visit nude spas in Japan when we visit with no drama or insecurity. Would I be trilled if he went to a nude beach with his buddies? No, but I would state my expectations for his behavior and how much I don\u2019t want to hear about it ever but I\u2019d say enjoy the view. She reacted from fear and you can\u2019t really blame her. This kind of thing has never been discussed. Take time to let her cool off and maybe she will be willing to listen. If she still disagrees and you still stand by your decision, maybe you\u2019re not compatible. No hard feelings. You\u2019re allowed to be you and do what you want but it must be with a partner that agrees with those boundaries. You\u2019re young and so is she. Let it go and live your life. There still so much neither of you know.", "NTA given she has not expressed prior issues with you going to a nude beach or bar. I get how this can be upsetting to her, but if you have not had any prior conversation about her not being ok with this, then she just needs some time to process it.\n\nIf you go again and not say anything ahead of time then YTA.", "I don\u2019t know tbh. This sub regularly says going to a strip club is cheating so it\u2019s interesting to see how neutrally the nude beach experience is perceived (where it\u2019s sure, just a bunch of naked bodies in the background). \n\nI am also simply at a loss as to why someone would want to get naked with their buddies. It sounds horrible. But that\u2019s none of my business lol. Soft YTA for not telling her in advance- maybe you don\u2019t care who she gets naked in front of either but I am\u2026 dubious as to that.\n\nNOTE: please stop lecturing me about the difference between a strip club and a nude beach (which i described as \u201cjust a bunch of naked bodies in the bg\u201d so no idea why you\u2019re rushing in here to say ITS NOT THE SAME AS A LAP DANCE- no shit). i noted merely that the sub is usually puritanical and said it was \u201cinteresting\u201d- that\u2019s all- to see the difference in judgment.", "NTA - I'd be rethinking the relationship. She is overly possessive and insecure.", "NTA! \n\nGlad to hear Wreck Beach is still around as a \"clothing optional\" beach!\n\nYour GF is being very prudish. There is nothing inherently sexual about a nude body. It's just \u2014 a naked body. I've been to nude/\"clothing optional\" beaches before, and it's very relaxing. It's not a sexualized atmosphere at all. \n\nYou did not \"cheat\" in any way. A bunch of people saw you naked, that's all. \n\nIt's alarming she'd claim the \"right\" to be the only one who could see your body. That seems pretty controlling. It's your body. And the person who has the right to decide who gets to see it or not \u2014 is you.\n\nNTA.", "OP the entire purpose of the nude beach is just to feel confident with your body and be respectful for others bodies as well.  It's not a free-for-all ogling other people.  It sounds like you and your guy friends had a great time enjoying the day doing something different, and in the end it's \"my body my choice\" so you have to decide what's best for you because she's putting limits on you.  Offer her the opportunity to go to the beach with you and show her that it's no big deal.  If she refuses, then decide if you want to keep this boundary or it becomes a deal breaker.", "She thinks she is the only one that has the right to see your body??\n\nThat is very controlling. NTA.", "NTA but take this is as a sign to have a potentially overdue conversation about boundaries and expectations in your relationship.", "I mean...you should tell her,its not just a normal beach its a NUDE beach... If its noemal to go ther for you two or she said she was fine with this its good but thats a thong you need to discuss before going there...", "NTA! You went to have fun with your friends not meet other girls. I can see why what not telling her would upset her but \u201cborderline\u201d cheating is a kind of over the top in my opinion", "NTA- Under the conditions that you would be perfectly fine with her going to a nude beach with her friends while you were away and didn\u2019t tell you.", "NTA\n\nI'd be mad if my other half went but that's because of my own insecurities. Her saying no one has the right to see your body but her is excessive.", "NAH this was a boundary that wasn't communicated before. Talk through it and see where you both sit should this situation come up again. You can't plan for every scenario ahead of time, but you can make a plan now", "NTA. Hanging out at a nude beach with your friends is not even close to borderline cheating. This level of insecurity from your girlfriend should be a huge red flag.", "If this caught you completely unaware, as in you would have had zero clues that she would be upset about you going to a nude beach, then you're completely in the clear.  \n\nNTA...  But...\n\nIf you went to the beach without her because you know that she has issues with jealousy and you might have had the idea that she would get upset, then you need to evaluate the relationship.  Maybe this isn't the girl for you.", "I think ESH. You should have at least mentioned it. But her reaction is borderline abusive. \u201cNobody has the right to your body but me\u201d is super supppper red flag coded", "YTA\n\nI think it's generally safe to assume that nudity, by default, is a boundary in relationships. The majority of people would be uncomfortable with their partner being naked around other people. At least I know I would. Sexual or \"naturist\".

I don\u2019t know why this has to be sexualized.  All these YTA comments are shocking to me.  It\u2019s your body!  This was not a sexual experience.  Being naked is relaxing.  I think more people need some nude beach time in their lives.", "NTA. You did tell her upon her return. You just didn't ask for permission. She went way overboard with the words she used. You didn't even go alone or with girls. There probably were ladies there, and that's worth discussing in the future, but her reaction was AH either way.", "Is she always so irrational?", "Nta", "NTA. \n\nBut also when it comes to our bodies and being around the other gender in general, my partner and I ALWAYS make sure that we at minimum tell the other what we\u2019re doing.

It\u2019s a respect for your partner thing", "Like the saying goes your body your choice nta", "Looking at both sides of this one,  I wouldn't call you the asshole, but I would say you're being apathetic regarding your girlfriend. \nI do believe you shouldn't have to give anyone constant updates on where you are or what you're doing. It's more that you didn't consider how your girlfriend might feel about that kind of situation. You yourself might not class a nude beach as a sexual situation, but she might. \nI understand how you or anyone can get caught up in the moment, but I still would have called her.\n\nYes, she may have insecurities, but where are they coming from? Has she been cheated on in the past? Is it a new relationship? \nI talked to my husband about it, and when we were dating, I would have reacted in a similar way back them.\n\nWhat I suggest is at least apologising for not taking her into consideration before going. Then, I would sit down with her and discuss what both of you are and aren't comfortable with, things that both of you would class as crossing a line or cheating. Open that line of communication and set some clear boundaries for your relationship. It will make you two stronger as a couple.", "NTA... if it had been her instead she would have had a hissy fit say \"it's my body and I can do what I wish with it\"", "NTA.  I'm so curious though - do guys at nude beaches have boners like constantly?  How could they not?  Why do I want to know?", "NAH\n\nObviously you have the right to do what you please with your own body, but I can also see where your gf might be coming from. People view nudity differently. Even if not inherently sexual, there are many who would consider seeing a person naked to be something special between them and their partner. \n\nMy guess is that, coming from insecurity or protectiveness, she doesn't like knowing that strangers or other girls might be seeing you naked at the beach. I don't think she cares about you and your buddies seeing each other naked lol\n\nRegardless, it's clear this was something you two had very different thoughts on, and communication is going to be important! While it could very possibly be that this is a big red flag, it could also be that she's just feeling hurt, self-conscious, and confused, so cut her a big of slack and make sure you two get a chance to discuss this calmly and like adults.", "Hahaha you might be the ass hole haha", "NAH. This seems like a miscommunication more than anything else. I can understand a person not wanting strangers to see their partner's genitalia, and I don't think that's an unreasonable ask.\n\nBut if you live in an area where nudism or nude beaches are common then I can't blame you for not anticipating her concerns. Being nude in public is totally acceptable in some cultures, but is seen as a crime in others.\n\nI think it's time to have an honest conversation about boundaries and expectations.", "YTA, if the roles were reversed would you seriously not mind? Other than her saying you're only for her to see, this was a shitty move. You went to a beach where'd you'd fund other nude women and you yourself are nude. You didn't even ask her beforehand or knew her boundaries/opinions on this. Idk why everyone is saying you're not, prolly other horny guys that don't respect their relationship. Definitely a dick move though and very disrespectful.", "So u went to the nude beach jus to chill w dudes? Idk man seems pretty gay", "How long have you two been dating?  I feel like most people are upfront about their thoughts with nudity... Wanna say YTA without mentioning it to her beforehand since there are a ton of people on this planet who are uncomfortable about stuff like this and it's pretty well known....  Seems like a normal boundary to discuss prior to stripping down naked in a large crowd lol.  Then again, you two are both really young so maybe you didn't know to even discuss something like that?  Just some advice, if you're serious about her, have an actual discussion and be sure to listen.  While nudity may not be a sexual thing to you, it is for other people.  What you did may have really upset her because she has different views than you do.  \n\nI'm a prudish person and was always very open about that with significant others even when I was in college.  Despite being in my 30s, I still look away or cover my eyes when nudity pops up on TV shows lol; it makes me uncomfortable.  I'm glad my husband finds it endearing lol.  My husband knew very very early in our relationship I'm not keen on certain environments due to nudity but, thankfully, he doesn't really enjoy those places either.  \n\nLong story short, you and your girlfriend have incompatible views on nudity... You have the right to body autonomy but she also has the right to her feelings.  It's up to you two to discuss it and come up with boundaries you're both okay with.  If you can't, maybe you two aren't meant to be.", "YTA, it's like you're sending a dick pic to all these girls what's the difference. That line about her body is for only her to see, i don't think she means it in a controlling way but being nude is kind of intimate and reserved for you partner unless you don't see nudity as a big deal im sure she does and it was wrong for you to do that not knowing where she stand in it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I didn't make my judgments on you having a different opinion, but based on the things you say. So he can not do anything without checking in or asking permission first? That is incredibly possessive/controlling and a red flag. That is something abusers do. It's also up to each person to discuss their personal boundaries. People are not mind readers.

But, if it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s reasonable to assume she would also feel those emotions since the roles were reversed. \n\nConsider also while this might not be a big thing for you, it can definitely be for others.

(You could be better though)\n\nI don\u2019t agree with her. However, I do think it would have been respectful to tell her before hand. Or more importantly, I think this is the kind of thing where, if nudism is part of your life, you should have had a conversation about this.\n\nThere is a broad spectrum for what different people consider cheating, or acceptable in relationships. This is why people sometimes cross a boundary without knowing. \n\nMaybe you would have an issue with her spending 2 hours on the phone talking to a guy friend about her problems instead of talking to you? Or maybe dancing with other guys on a night out might feel like cheating? Neither of these are cheating for me, but they may cross a boundary for you. I think you two need to have a conversation about what these boundaries are. Cheating isn\u2019t exclusive to sexual activity. \n\nI think nudism is great. It\u2019s not sexual and you should be free to do it, but if you\u2019re making her uncomfortable, that should be something that you want to address. This way, you can keep doing the things you want, in a way that lets her know you still respect her feelings. \n\nMaybe she will be fine with nudism as long as no women are involved. Maybe she will want to join. Maybe she wants it off the table completely. \n\nFor the record, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to scrutinise the double standard regarding her comment about your body. She is hurt and feels cheated on, that\u2019s the issue. This isn\u2019t an issue of someone being manipulative and controlling. Her feelings are valid, you were naked in public with other people and she didn\u2019t know about it. Nudism is fine, but so is being emotionally responsible for the people on your relationship.", "I'd say YTA for one simple reason. These things should be discussed beforehand. Nudity can be a very ambivalent topic, some people are a-ok, some aren't. Just like going to strip clubs, flirting, watching porn etc. All of those things should be things you should discuss since people may have very specific feelings about them. I find it very disingenuous just to gloss over that, and simply going without knowing your partner's opinion prior. Not saying one is right and the other wrong on the topic itself. It's fine if you don't find anything wrong with it. It's fine for her to not be ok with it, although the way she framed it was super weird. Intimacy however is something very personal and MUST be discussed in order to find out your boundaries. Not bringing up the topic at all seems willfully disingenuous.

Healthy communication. \n\nBUT... you've done nothing wrong. \nYou went to the beach with some mates and were comfortable in your skin.\n\nI dunno, I'd probably apologise for not mentioning it prior as it's obviously made them uncomfortable but not for going and definitely not for being comfortable in my own skin... its not ok that she's reacting like this at all. \n\nControlling and gaslighting af. You've not cheated and the borderline cheating comment is always such bs.", "I feel like in her mind you guys went there to look at naked girls and that's why she is bothered. NTA but your touching on some insecurities for her so tread carefully and try to have some understanding.", "Well, that's an easy NTA. She tried to claim your body? Didn't we just have this whole movement how man should not do that to woman? It's the same the other way around. \n\nYou would only be an AH if you did not allow her to do the same. But you don't seem to be that type.\n\nAlso, since she went straight towards cheating: Think hard about this. Most people who do this are cheaters themselves. It also shows she doesn't even trust you on your word. Not a good thing in relationships.", "NTA. You clearly weren\u2019t trying to hide that you went. It\u2019s high school level insecurity to freak out over something like this, no matter how someone views nudity. If it made her uncomfortable she could\u2019ve expressed that and started a conversation. But no it is not at all cheating. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because her thoughts immediately go to you looking at others\u2019 naked bodies and them looking at yours and possibly hitting on you, a catalyst for cheating. Which is obviously an assumption from a place of distrust. Does she also think watching porn is cheating? Most don\u2019t. But that\u2019s worse than a nude beach because it\u2019s inherently sexual. \n\nI think this convo is a clear sign to reconsider the relationship. People can apologize for poor communication and try to change, but I think her reaction speaks to a major compatibility issue. Do you want a girl that goes control freak over shit like this or one who thinks it\u2019s cool and might wanna join next time? \n\nI\u2019m just sayin, you\u2019re young and life\u2019s short. Many men are afraid to do stuff like this. They think it\u2019s sexual and weird to see other men especially naked. There are plenty of women though who\u2019d love a guy so open minded and relaxed. And not have extreme baggage/jealousy issues. \n\nGot a little carried away! But I\u2019m early 20s f and I just relate to living an abnormal uninhibited lifestyle, contending with being sexualized 24/7.

Would she be NTA because she didn\u2019t know the boundaries and it was never discussed? I personally don\u2019t think these issues are as black and white as you seem to think.

But it\u2019s disingenuous to say she\u2019s straight up wrong and she\u2019s a freak prude because Europeans are nude all the time\u2026and frankly it\u2019s just a cop out to dismiss someone\u2019s feelings about their boundaries.  She was not given an opportunity to assert her boundaries ahead of time and clearly feels her trust was violated as a result.

That falls under the generally assumed stuff that most people can agree on. In fact you'd probably have to discuss it being ok far more than it being not. I said there are pretty basic areas where you shouldn't need a discussion on them to have the boundary. \n\nNudity isn't one. Porn isn't one.\n\nYou keep making these obvious examples about it's cheating that you shouldn't need to discuss.

It\u2019s ultimately his decision based on what he wants. \n\nI feel like this conversation has lost the plot but the original point is that the approximate phrase of -they can\u2019t see your naked body because I own it- is perverse and descriptive of abusive behaviors.
