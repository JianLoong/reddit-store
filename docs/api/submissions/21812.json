You don't need her permission to get naked with your friends and play at the beach.", "NAH. You're entitled to do what you want but she is entitled to feel uncomfortable about it. I personally would be upset if my significant other went to a nude beach without mentioning it beforehand. Her feelings of discomfort are valid because a nude beach can be seen as sexual. But on the flipside, if you don't make it sexual then you haven't technically done anything wrong.", "NTA - you two seem to have different values, and that warrants a serious discussion.  But your body is your choice, and unless there is other evidence of cheating, it seems like you just had a fun day at the beach.  \n\nAs someone who has been to Wreck Beach many times, I can affirm that there is nothing particularly \u2018sexy\u2019 about group public nudity.  Maybe you have to be from Vancouver to get it, but as long as everyone involved is an adult, I see no issue with this.", "Info needed: Would you have been ok if she told you that she and a few of her girlfriends went to a nude beach all day? Would you have been positive no guys were there or would be ok with other people seeing her fully naked and frolicking around?\n\nNot asking if you would ok with her actually doing that, but would you have been ok with finding out after the fact?", "Personally, I think I\u2019d have more of an issue with my partner seeing other people naked than I would over someone seeing them naked, but boundaries are different for different people. You didn\u2019t go to the beach with the intent to look at other women. You went to have fun, enjoy the water and weed, and chill with your friends. There was no ill will at all in going. Sounds innocent enough to me. \n\nI understand why your girlfriend is upset. (Honestly, I might be too in her shoes.) You being naked in public is clearly a boundary for her. If that\u2019s the case, she needs to communicate that calmly instead of casting aspersions. She is definitely overreacting. The accusation that you \u201cborderline cheated\u201d by going to a nude beach is ludicrous, considering the activities you and your friends took part in. It reeks of a lack of trust. \n\nI was going to vote N A H because this superficially seems like a lack of communication over boundaries on her end and an innocent day out on yours, but her reaction is excessive and upsetting.

Her comments are obviously over the top, and they are definitely more of a her problem than a you problem. \n\nThat said, going to a nude beach is completely normal, but it\u2019s not common.

It's YOUR body, not a possession of hers to control... \n\nNTA, without a conversation about going to nude beaches beforehand, there was no way for you to know she would be that opposed to it. Generally, going anywhere where people are completely or mostly nude should warrant a conversation beforehand, like a strip club for example, but a nude beach is way different than a strip club. Yea some creeps go to nude beaches to, well... creep.. on other people but a very very large majority of people are there to just.. be naked on the beach, it's not a sexual thing. And definitely not \"borderline cheating\" because of that.", "NTA, a nude beach is not a sex club/orgy. Sexualizing nudity in itself is a different mentality.", "NTA, though obviously you and your girlfriend have  different ideas about nudity that may become an issue down the road depending on how much you enjoy the naturalist lifestyle. This is a great opportunity to have that discussion to find out if you can reach a compromise (you get to do your thing without facing censure, you won't insist she join you).", "NTA. you\u2019re the sole owner of your body and theres nothing wrong with the nude form. HOWEVER, with that being said, not initially telling her is probably what mostly caused her to freak out. it may have made her feel like you hid it from her intentionally since you only told her afterwards, which is likely why she\u2019s worried about cheating.", "NTA.  Nude beaches aren't my thing, and I can understand her being a little squicked out by it, but I think \"borderline cheated\" is an overreaction.", "Not the asshole.\n\nI can see why she would be a little weirded out about you going to a nude beach, but she took it to an accusatory level and claimed that you were cheating on her when all you did was hang out with your friends who are all male (that is if I'm to assume that you are heterosexual). She may be insecure due to past relationships going under because of infidelity on the part of her past partner(s), but there is not enough info there to make that clear. I would suggest having more clear and direct communication with your gf moving forward and avoiding the nude beach just to be safe.", "I\u2019d have to say conditional NTA, as some stuff sounds petty.\n\nIf you\u2019d be okay with her coming up to you and saying \u201cGuess what! We all [insert exact same scenario but flipped],\u201d then I\u2019d deem you not the asshole.\n\nIf you\u2019d be angry with her for behaving as you have behaved but in reverse, I take back my N T A.\n\nIt\u2019s not a matter of asking permission; it\u2019s a matter of respecting whatever standard the two of you have established as being defined as respecting the monogamy of your relationship while also respecting the individuality of your selves.", "Red flag about the comment, she's the only one allowed to see you naked. Interesting that she jumped to the part about you going with girls.. Trust and control issues going on there.\nAs you said it was a spur of the moment thing and didn't think anything of it. I guess now that you know how she feels about it. This will be one of many things she will have control over. How comfortable are you in having your life controled by your gf. She doesn't trust you and will be controling you if you allow her.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but it should have been discussed to give her time to consider it. My husband would never go to a strip club because I don\u2019t want him watching real life women be sexualized in person. But a nude beach is different. It isn\u2019t about sex. It\u2019s about being bare in nature. He doesn\u2019t know this because it\u2019s never come up but we do agree than we will visit nude spas in Japan when we visit with no drama or insecurity. Would I be trilled if he went to a nude beach with his buddies? No, but I would state my expectations for his behavior and how much I don\u2019t want to hear about it ever but I\u2019d say enjoy the view. She reacted from fear and you can\u2019t really blame her. This kind of thing has never been discussed. Take time to let her cool off and maybe she will be willing to listen. If she still disagrees and you still stand by your decision, maybe you\u2019re not compatible. No hard feelings. You\u2019re allowed to be you and do what you want but it must be with a partner that agrees with those boundaries. You\u2019re young and so is she. Let it go and live your life. There still so much neither of you know.", "NTA given she has not expressed prior issues with you going to a nude beach or bar. I get how this can be upsetting to her, but if you have not had any prior conversation about her not being ok with this, then she just needs some time to process it.\n\nIf you go again and not say anything ahead of time then YTA.", "I don\u2019t know tbh. This sub regularly says going to a strip club is cheating so it\u2019s interesting to see how neutrally the nude beach experience is perceived (where it\u2019s sure, just a bunch of naked bodies in the background). \n\nI am also simply at a loss as to why someone would want to get naked with their buddies. It sounds horrible. But that\u2019s none of my business lol. Soft YTA for not telling her in advance- maybe you don\u2019t care who she gets naked in front of either but I am\u2026 dubious as to that.\n\nNOTE: please stop lecturing me about the difference between a strip club and a nude beach (which i described as \u201cjust a bunch of naked bodies in the bg\u201d so no idea why you\u2019re rushing in here to say ITS NOT THE SAME AS A LAP DANCE- no shit). i noted merely that the sub is usually puritanical and said it was \u201cinteresting\u201d- that\u2019s all- to see the difference in judgment.", "NTA - I'd be rethinking the relationship. She is overly possessive and insecure.", "NTA! \n\nGlad to hear Wreck Beach is still around as a \"clothing optional\" beach!\n\nYour GF is being very prudish. There is nothing inherently sexual about a nude body. It's just \u2014 a naked body. I've been to nude/\"clothing optional\" beaches before, and it's very relaxing. It's not a sexualized atmosphere at all. \n\nYou did not \"cheat\" in any way. A bunch of people saw you naked, that's all. \n\nIt's alarming she'd claim the \"right\" to be the only one who could see your body. That seems pretty controlling. It's your body. And the person who has the right to decide who gets to see it or not \u2014 is you.\n\nNTA.", "OP the entire purpose of the nude beach is just to feel confident with your body and be respectful for others bodies as well.  It's not a free-for-all ogling other people.  It sounds like you and your guy friends had a great time enjoying the day doing something different, and in the end it's \"my body my choice\" so you have to decide what's best for you because she's putting limits on you.  Offer her the opportunity to go to the beach with you and show her that it's no big deal.  If she refuses, then decide if you want to keep this boundary or it becomes a deal breaker.", "She thinks she is the only one that has the right to see your body??\n\nThat is very controlling. NTA.", "NTA but take this is as a sign to have a potentially overdue conversation about boundaries and expectations in your relationship.", "I mean...you should tell her,its not just a normal beach its a NUDE beach... If its noemal to go ther for you two or she said she was fine with this its good but thats a thong you need to discuss before going there...", "NTA! You went to have fun with your friends not meet other girls. I can see why what not telling her would upset her but \u201cborderline\u201d cheating is a kind of over the top in my opinion", "NTA- Under the conditions that you would be perfectly fine with her going to a nude beach with her friends while you were away and didn\u2019t tell you.", "NTA\n\nI'd be mad if my other half went but that's because of my own insecurities. Her saying no one has the right to see your body but her is excessive.", "NAH this was a boundary that wasn't communicated before. Talk through it and see where you both sit should this situation come up again. You can't plan for every scenario ahead of time, but you can make a plan now", "NTA. Hanging out at a nude beach with your friends is not even close to borderline cheating. This level of insecurity from your girlfriend should be a huge red flag.", "If this caught you completely unaware, as in you would have had zero clues that she would be upset about you going to a nude beach, then you're completely in the clear.  \n\nNTA...  But...\n\nIf you went to the beach without her because you know that she has issues with jealousy and you might have had the idea that she would get upset, then you need to evaluate the relationship.

I don\u2019t know why this has to be sexualized.  All these YTA comments are shocking to me.  It\u2019s your body!  This was not a sexual experience.  Being naked is relaxing.  I think more people need some nude beach time in their lives.", "NTA. You did tell her upon her return. You just didn't ask for permission. She went way overboard with the words she used. You didn't even go alone or with girls. There probably were ladies there, and that's worth discussing in the future, but her reaction was AH either way.", "Is she always so irrational?", "Nta", "NTA. \n\nBut also when it comes to our bodies and being around the other gender in general, my partner and I ALWAYS make sure that we at minimum tell the other what we\u2019re doing.

It\u2019s a respect for your partner thing", "Like the saying goes your body your choice nta", "Looking at both sides of this one,  I wouldn't call you the asshole, but I would say you're being apathetic regarding your girlfriend. \nI do believe you shouldn't have to give anyone constant updates on where you are or what you're doing. It's more that you didn't consider how your girlfriend might feel about that kind of situation. You yourself might not class a nude beach as a sexual situation, but she might. \nI understand how you or anyone can get caught up in the moment, but I still would have called her.\n\nYes, she may have insecurities, but where are they coming from? Has she been cheated on in the past? Is it a new relationship? \nI talked to my husband about it, and when we were dating, I would have reacted in a similar way back them.\n\nWhat I suggest is at least apologising for not taking her into consideration before going. Then, I would sit down with her and discuss what both of you are and aren't comfortable with, things that both of you would class as crossing a line or cheating. Open that line of communication and set some clear boundaries for your relationship. It will make you two stronger as a couple.", "NTA... if it had been her instead she would have had a hissy fit say \"it's my body and I can do what I wish with it\"", "NTA.  I'm so curious though - do guys at nude beaches have boners like constantly?  How could they not?  Why do I want to know?", "NAH\n\nObviously you have the right to do what you please with your own body, but I can also see where your gf might be coming from. People view nudity differently. Even if not inherently sexual, there are many who would consider seeing a person naked to be something special between them and their partner. \n\nMy guess is that, coming from insecurity or protectiveness, she doesn't like knowing that strangers or other girls might be seeing you naked at the beach. I don't think she cares about you and your buddies seeing each other naked lol\n\nRegardless, it's clear this was something you two had very different thoughts on, and communication is going to be important! While it could very possibly be that this is a big red flag, it could also be that she's just feeling hurt, self-conscious, and confused, so cut her a big of slack and make sure you two get a chance to discuss this calmly and like adults.", "Hahaha you might be the ass hole haha", "NAH. This seems like a miscommunication more than anything else. I can understand a person not wanting strangers to see their partner's genitalia, and I don't think that's an unreasonable ask.\n\nBut if you live in an area where nudism or nude beaches are common then I can't blame you for not anticipating her concerns. Being nude in public is totally acceptable in some cultures, but is seen as a crime in others.\n\nI think it's time to have an honest conversation about boundaries and expectations.", "YTA, if the roles were reversed would you seriously not mind? Other than her saying you're only for her to see, this was a shitty move. You went to a beach where'd you'd fund other nude women and you yourself are nude. You didn't even ask her beforehand or knew her boundaries/opinions on this. Idk why everyone is saying you're not, prolly other horny guys that don't respect their relationship. Definitely a dick move though and very disrespectful.", "So u went to the nude beach jus to chill w dudes? Idk man seems pretty gay", "How long have you two been dating?  I feel like most people are upfront about their thoughts with nudity... Wanna say YTA without mentioning it to her beforehand since there are a ton of people on this planet who are uncomfortable about stuff like this and it's pretty well known....  Seems like a normal boundary to discuss prior to stripping down naked in a large crowd lol.  Then again, you two are both really young so maybe you didn't know to even discuss something like that?  Just some advice, if you're serious about her, have an actual discussion and be sure to listen.  While nudity may not be a sexual thing to you, it is for other people.  What you did may have really upset her because she has different views than you do.  \n\nI'm a prudish person and was always very open about that with significant others even when I was in college.  Despite being in my 30s, I still look away or cover my eyes when nudity pops up on TV shows lol; it makes me uncomfortable.  I'm glad my husband finds it endearing lol.  My husband knew very very early in our relationship I'm not keen on certain environments due to nudity but, thankfully, he doesn't really enjoy those places either.  \n\nLong story short, you and your girlfriend have incompatible views on nudity... You have the right to body autonomy but she also has the right to her feelings.  It's up to you two to discuss it and come up with boundaries you're both okay with.  If you can't, maybe you two aren't meant to be.", "YTA, it's like you're sending a dick pic to all these girls what's the difference. That line about her body is for only her to see, i don't think she means it in a controlling way but being nude is kind of intimate and reserved for you partner unless you don't see nudity as a big deal im sure she does and it was wrong for you to do that not knowing where she stand in it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was far from a sexual experience. I\u2019m not an expert in them, but from what I\u2019ve seen about them and nudist colonies online, that\u2019s the norm. It\u2019s not a sex club.", "Her feelings are valid but her actions make her a huge AH.  You don't get to claim someone's body and make up a scenario about cheating to have boundaries.  \n\nShe could've easily said, \"hey, future reference, this made me super uncomfortable and it's a boundary of mine.\"", "Nude body's are not inherently sexual.", "Agreed. She obviously took things to the extreme, but at a high level I don\u2019t blame her for being upset. The internet likes to pretend that nudity isn\u2019t sexualized in a lot of places (and don\u2019t get me wrong, I believe it shouldn\u2019t be sexualized), but there\u2019s also plenty of places where it is. It\u2019s not like my partner would need my permission or anything, but some sort of heads up would be appreciated", "Comments? No, I think you mean the declaration of having a right over HIS body ?", "I agree wholeheartedly", "Also mad weird to want to hang out with with your buddies and have your junk flying around??? A little gay imo. Borderline cheating. Very homosexual.", "I think it's a bit disingenuous to call it \"being naked in public\". \n\nIt's a nude beach. Would you call going to a sauna, bathhouse or gym changing room \"being naked in public\"?", "Yeah absolutely. To my knowledge she\u2019s already changed and been topless in front of her friends plenty of times.", "The strip club is inherently a sexually charged environment.  The purpose is for the performers to be naked in a sexually provocative way.  A nude beach isn't", "I would never say a strip club is cheating, I just don't really get the appeal. I'm bisexual, I like everybody, but I'm not gonna go pay to see what I can just google if I really wanna look at some naked bodies, you know?\n\nBut yeah, still, a nude beach is absolutely not sexual, so I do see why some might have an issue with the strip club but not the beach.", "You know nude beaches aren't a sexual thing right?", "Cause it was a new experience. No need to sexualize it.", "Why?", "[deleted]", "Because OP is not the AH. Also, not a dude, let alone a horn dude.", "[deleted]", "Not a horny dude here, and I say NTA and she's def a red flag for acting like his body belongs to her. \n\nI'm a bisexual enby, I literally am attracted to everybody, and I would just think my partner was braver than me if they told me they went to a nude beach. I could understand if you thought they lack communication, but saying only horny guys who don't respect relationships say NTA is very naive. People's thoughts about nudity aren't the same. A good example is that in most of society's eyes women's nipples and men's nipples aren't the same, to me all people should be able to go topless because some just have more fat behind them than others. \n\nYou can make your judgment on him being TA, but don't assume everybody saying he did nothing wrong are all 'horny dudes' and we don't respect our relationships.", "I\u2019m sure you\u2019re just joking. But years ago my friend and I caught a man with a boner taking pictures of us at a nude beach in Byron Bay and it was extremely uncomfortable \ud83d\ude23", "You mean you don't have to call your mom for permission every time you put on your birthday suit?", "Nude beaches aren't sexual, but I've read tons of stuff by or about people who went there because they thought it would be (often being disappointed) so I can understand why someone might be uncomfortable. Though I don't think OP did anything wrong or that his gf responded in the right way.", "You can\u2019t make boundaries for other people\u2019s behavior. That\u2019s not how boundaries work.", "Not *inherently* sexual, but people do often get sexually aroused by seeing them, and I've read a fair amount by or about people who went to nude beaches for that purpose. Not saying this is what OP was intending.", "Is this supposed to be sarcasm?", "I hope you\u2019re joking.", "What? Unless they were having sex, it\u2019s not gay. I\u2019ve been naked in front of my girl friends before, none of us are lesbians.", "As a straight person, I guess the only difference for me would be my partner being nude in front of other people of the opposite gender (and yeah, not sexual in any which way but still). \n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind it at all, but I just would prefer a heads up just because it\u2019s a pretty uncommon thing. I would kinda equate it to wanting a heads up if my partner is going skydiving, going on a trip somewhere, staying out late partying, or anything else that isn\u2019t the norm for them.", "Changing in front of friends and being at a nude beach aren't quite the same thing. I highly doubt that the issue is that you were naked with your buddies.\n\nLikely the issue is that there were women at this beach that a) you saw and b) saw you. Even if nothing outright sexual happened, it can still make a SO uncomfortable or insecure", "A better question would be if it bothered you if she was getting naked around her male friends.", "I think you slyly avoided the question ;) point blank, would you be okay with her and the girls going to a nude beach, and if you were nude, which you also avoided clarifying, would you be okay with her being nude at said nude beach with the girls and any other persons there?", "Wow never occurred to me lol. Please differentiate more between these two things I\u2019m finding this so enlightening.", "it\u2019s a bit sexual tho. you and your boys went to look around. at least be honest.", "it\u2019s a totally non-sexual erection. super normal.", "Okay so you're a girl and you'd be okay with it? Pick me \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "Not projecting lol, you're a guy, you wouldn't get it. Plus you didn't answer my question, you'd be okay with her getting nude and looking at nude men?", "Never mentioned sex but you don't know how she sees it or where she stands on it. You're on AITA, so why're you trying to defend your actions lol it's for us to judge. That's what I think and what your gf probably thinks too.", "i'm sure that's not what it was about. being naked w your partner is something intimate and it's not the same after he goes and shows the whole beach. i'm sure she doesn't mind him being at the beach w trunks on, but having his privates out is more intimate and obviously a private thing amongst people, kinda weird to just go and show everyone.", "Birthday suit? I just wear swim shorts cuz ima summer baby", "You're right.  OP can decide to respect her boundary if he's ok with it, or decide they're incompatible.", "I mean, you can.\nI have a personally boundary with my partners body, in that I don\u2019t want other men\u2019s dick\u2019s in it.\nI have no right to stop her, but I have the right to break up with her in that instance.", "Fair enough. \n\nI think that's reasonable to prefer a heads up, but I don't agree that OP NOT giving a heads up makes him TA.", "Not saying it\u2019s the same, just pointing out how mundane being naked around your friends is.", "That\u2019s actually not the same at all, it would be if he would be ok with her getting naked around male strangers, he wasn\u2019t with female friends who might be attracted to him, he was with his male friends and strangers. You are purposely trying to make it a fit situation then it was", "Yes I\u2019d be fine with it. Even with male friends. I\u2019d think it was weird not to say anything, but would not be as angry as she is at me", "You decided to compare the two so don't complain about people calling you out", "Damn you\u2019ve never been to a nude beach, the majority of people are always old men. Didn\u2019t see a single girl our age. Grow up.", "Just because there's nudity being involved doesn't mean its sexual..?", "Well, that's an inaccurate assumption. Do you always assume the worst of people when they see things differently than you?", "Was the nude beach full of just your guy friends?", "Well then there is the answer as you already probably knew :) not the asshole, keep communication open and do as you would like / expect her to do. The obvious unfortunate situation is if your views misalign too much and / or her insecurities damage the relationship =\\ wishing you both the best and hope this gets resolved well!", "*rolling my eyes* i compared the two cleanly. you read\u2026. poorly. it annoys me to have someone regurgitate things i\u2019ve already said as if they\u2019re revelatory.", "why would i go to a nude beach? i\u2019m not a naturalist. and i don\u2019t mind wearing a swimsuit. i only share my naked bits with people i love. \n\nbut you can absolutely keep pretending you just went to be naked with the lads.", "for naturalist and nudists, that\u2019s absolutely true. for voyeurs, not so much. it completely depends on the person. \n\nOP responded that there were no girls his age there. if you don\u2019t think he was looking, then we\u2019ll agree to disagree. \n\nside note: i\u2019m also not of the opinion that people bought playboy for the articles. but that\u2019s just me.", "Just my opinion if you don't like it move on. You also ignored my question. Doubt you'd be completely fine w that. Same thing if he was to send dick pics to a girl or post his body in socials.", "Voyeurs don't really have anything to do with this, I understand how that works yes but that's not relevant. Nudity by itself is not sexual, period. You can twist any one thing like that. And looking around a beach I wouldn't say constitutes as much, these people were walking around, swimming, smoking and eating - do you expect them to be staring off into the water or down the entire time? What direction do you think they're looking in when they're rafting and swimming back? Also, I've never been to a nude beach but yes everyone knows they're filled with old people.", ">Same thing if he was to send dick pics to a girl or post his body in socials.\n\nGirl what ?? \n\nSending dick pics comes with the intention of sexual gratification of some sort, and posting naked/half naked pics online comes with the intention of interaction or feedback from your audience and sometimes also sexual gratification.....going to a nude beach with a bunch of people who are not sexualizing every naked body around them just for being naked is not even close to the same thing lmao \n\nPeople on the beach will be out there minding their own business, just enjoying the sun.", "Yes, I would be fine with my bf/husband going to a nude beach with his buddies without me. He would not need to ask me permission either. Those are not comparable at all. Maybe the body on social media has some minor similarities but still a different ballgame. You can tell you are very young, insecure, and obsessively possessive.", "so you think that everyone at the beach is just there to be free? maybe it\u2019s how i was raised. or the danger that men pose. but i don\u2019t trust the people around me not to be absolute creeps. \n\nand the OP already mentioned that some men were sporting erections. so say what you will about nudity, but it definitely means something to most people. (but i\u2019ll exclude true naturalists)", "You don't know people aren't sexualizing it. And if she has a right to be upset he shouldn't try to ignore her feelings or make they seem like they're not a big deal.", "None of that, and look at you complaining that i'm assuming when you are too. I'm not tryin to be controlling just saying if the girl was upset is bc she had a problem w it and different boundaries than the guy, her feelings shouldn't be ignored.", "Nowhere does it say anything about him minimizing her feelings on it. Reading between the lines, he's genuinely trying to understand why she's so upset over it, he didn't expect it or he wouldn't have brought up the fact that he went. Typically you'll see snide little comments in these types of posts when someone thinks their partner is overreacting or being irrational. This post has none of that. \n\nAnd you should check out nudist community forums or something of the sort... there's always gonna be creeps out there but, generally speaking, people who go to nude beaches don't sexualize people for just being nude. It's just a body. Most of world is like that honestly.", "I thought we were supposed to be making judgments of each other. So it's only okay when you do it? No one is saying she isn't allowed to be upset or have different boundaries. They weren't previously stated, so it makes OP not the AH. But her reaction is a major redflag. She thinks she owns his body.", "yea but it seems like he's not understanding why she's upset. just thinks it was overreacting how he's replying to some comments.", "hypocrite, and that's why, if he didn't know how she felt about it or even asked her first, he shouldn't have done it period. when you're in a relationship you're not free to do as you please without taking your partners feelings into consideration. you're partners for a reason, you become one and have to be less selfish. and you can say that sounds controlling but it's the truth. if you don't care what they might think or feel or care to let them know beforehand why are you even in a relationship.", "Of course it seems like he doesn't understand, he explicitly stated that in the post. That's exactly why he posted, to try and understand. The thing is, if he genuinely believed, wholeheartedly, that she was overreacting, this post would read like he was here to get validation on that opinion, which it doesn't read like that at all, and neither do his comments\n\nIf it did read like that I would 100% say he's being an AH, there's no space in a relationship for dismissed feelings and even more so for people who run to reddit to back that attitude but that's not what I see happening here", "Yes, you are a hypocrite. I didn't make my judgments on you having a different opinion, but based on the things you say. So he can not do anything without checking in or asking permission first? That is incredibly possessive/controlling and a red flag. That is something abusers do. It's also up to each person to discuss their personal boundaries. People are not mind readers. Not just drop them on a person and then get mad at them while saying that they own their body/it's only for them. \n\nOP is not an AH for going to a nude beach. They had no idea that their partner considered it a boundary. Now they are at a crossroads. OP either respects the boundary (also thoroughly discusses boundaries) walks away. They should probably walk away as OPs partner thinks she owns his body. A partner does not own your body."]}
