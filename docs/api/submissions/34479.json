{"id": 34479, "submission_id": "190c24z", "title": "AITA for denying my husband an alcohol run while our baby was screaming in the backseat", "selftext": "UPDATE: my husband and I have been together since we were 19 and 20 years old. He is my best friend at the end of the day. I am resentful. I have a lot of my plate. I\u2019m going to be looking into couples therapy. We\u2019ve talked about it before, but never bit the bullet on it. Clearly our second baby is pushing us to our limits and we need help. Thinking back, those who said I shouldn\u2019t have brought the kids are right, but I also wanted to spend time as a family doing something not stuck at home. I also don\u2019t see my husband much during the week. He\u2019s not a bad guy. He\u2019s a pretty good guy and generally has a good heart. He\u2019s funny and goofy. We share common interests. We\u2019re both stressed and handling it differently. \n\nI (31F) and my husband (30M) have 2 kids. I work from home and am in a demanding leadership position at a big company, I am also the primary breadwinner. My grandma helps me watch the kids while I work from home. My husband works in an office and recently accepted a hybrid position so this might change a bit. This is important because I am literally with the kids 24/7, I work from home so I literally never leave the house. My husband gets home late and leaves early. While he\u2019s out he goes shopping during lunch, goes out to eat, gets to stop at the grocery store, gets to spend some time out of the house period.\n\nToday, after we got back from an errand together, he goes, \u201cokay! I\u2019m going grocery shopping now! You good if I step out?\u201d\n\nI said no. I\u2019ve been in the house all week, I had a rough week, I\u2019d like to go out too. So we made it a family trip. \n\nOne of the main things we disagree on right now is letting our 5 month old cry. He doesn\u2019t know how to soothe the baby and is fine with just letting him scream. I mentally cannot take it and just take him from him. He always cries getting in the car, usually stops about 10 minutes into the car RIDE. The car has to be moving. After the grocery store trip he was already getting fussy, we put him in the car and he starts screaming and our 5 year old said she\u2019s hungry and thirsty. He immediately goes, \u201cokay! Time for an alcohol run!\u201d (The liquor store is in the same parking lot). \n\nI said absolutely not. I\u2019m not sitting in the car with my screaming tired baby while he goes to buy alcohol. He can come back later if it\u2019s so important to him. He responds, \u201cyou should\u2019ve never even come with me\u201d and pouts the whole way home. \n\nOnce home we\u2019re putting groceries away and he stops to just eat chips. I\u2019m getting frustrated and snippy and I ask him if he thinks his mom would agree with him if I asked. He said he didn\u2019t care. He said no one would put up with someone like me and that I\u2019ve been miserable for the last two months (this coincides with me going back to work). So I said, gee I wonder why. And he responds \u201cwell I\u2019m glad you agree you\u2019re miserable and don\u2019t deny it.\u201d\n\nI then start cleaning the house, baby on my hip, and he\u2019s sitting on the couch on his phone while my daughter plays pokemon.\n\nWas I supposed to just let him leave my baby crying in the car and my other kid hungry while he went to get alcohol because he decided he wanted a drink tonight? Was I really such an asshole and shitty wife for saying no and causing this whole blow up. I feel so resentful.\n\nTLDR: my husband wanted to go to the liquor store and I said no because I didn\u2019t want to sit in the car with my screaming baby and hungry child. This caused a blow up with him saying I should\u2019ve never come and that I\u2019m miserable and no one would put up with me.", "created_utc": 1704580006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190c24z/aita_for_denying_my_husband_an_alcohol_run_while/", "score": 1021, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also sounds like there might be some beneficial changes on the horizon with your husband\u2019s new position/hybrid schedule. But you guys need to find a balance in how to parent, fairly divide the labor, and maintain your relationship with each other, not just as parents to two young children.\n\nI get being frustrated at a crying baby.

My first child had feeding issues, still does. I didn\u2019t get to breastfeed her, which was important to me, because she wound up needing tube feedings. This time around, I was able to, I waited too long to introduce bottles and now he rejects them or maybe kind of sort of eats an oz or two. To compound things, he also has a milk protein intolerance and I\u2019m a just enougher with no stash. So he has to drink that extremely bitter special formula if I don\u2019t have enough milk pumped before leaving. He won\u2019t drink it point blank. So I can be away\u2026 but not for too long. \n\nIf I have to go to the office, I\u2019ve literally had to spend my lunch pumping, driving back home to drop it off, and driving back to my job.

It doesn\u2019t sound like he is out of the house much more than work and errands either though. It\u2019s honestly hard to tell, because she is currently overworked.

It\u2019s not always worth it to put the baby and the rest of the family through hell forcing a bottle when they\u2019re stubborn and you\u2019re there!

Not sure if that means Grandma is in charge of the kids, or if OP is still trying to do childcare during the day. \n\nBut I do think trying to not have consistent consistent child free time is harming OP. \nOP mentioned in a  comment sometimes working until 2am to make up for what seems like not working during the day because she is taking care of the kids. \n\nThat sounds unsustainable. OP is trying to worm a job that sounds like it is 40+ hours a week, but trying to work those hours on top of watching the children during the day. \n\nThat honestly sounds like OP is putting themselves up on the cross. Trying to work 2/2.5 full time jobs. \n\nI think OP should work from an office/coffee shop during the day and let the kids stay home with Grandma and/or put the kids in daycare at least part-time. \n\nThat is not to say that husband can't pick up the slack. \n\nIt seems to me OP is operating at 200% and husband might be operating at 70%.
