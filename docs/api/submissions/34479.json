I work from home and am in a demanding leadership position at a big company, I am also the primary breadwinner. My grandma helps me watch the kids while I work from home. My husband works in an office and recently accepted a hybrid position so this might change a bit. This is important because I am literally with the kids 24/7, I work from home so I literally never leave the house. My husband gets home late and leaves early. While he\u2019s out he goes shopping during lunch, goes out to eat, gets to stop at the grocery store, gets to spend some time out of the house period.\n\nToday, after we got back from an errand together, he goes, \u201cokay! I\u2019m going grocery shopping now! You good if I step out?\u201d\n\nI said no. I\u2019ve been in the house all week, I had a rough week, I\u2019d like to go out too. So we made it a family trip. \n\nOne of the main things we disagree on right now is letting our 5 month old cry. He doesn\u2019t know how to soothe the baby and is fine with just letting him scream. I mentally cannot take it and just take him from him. He always cries getting in the car, usually stops about 10 minutes into the car RIDE. The car has to be moving. After the grocery store trip he was already getting fussy, we put him in the car and he starts screaming and our 5 year old said she\u2019s hungry and thirsty. He immediately goes, \u201cokay! Time for an alcohol run!\u201d (The liquor store is in the same parking lot). \n\nI said absolutely not. I\u2019m not sitting in the car with my screaming tired baby while he goes to buy alcohol. He can come back later if it\u2019s so important to him. He responds, \u201cyou should\u2019ve never even come with me\u201d and pouts the whole way home. \n\nOnce home we\u2019re putting groceries away and he stops to just eat chips. I\u2019m getting frustrated and snippy and I ask him if he thinks his mom would agree with him if I asked. He said he didn\u2019t care. He said no one would put up with someone like me and that I\u2019ve been miserable for the last two months (this coincides with me going back to work). So I said, gee I wonder why. And he responds \u201cwell I\u2019m glad you agree you\u2019re miserable and don\u2019t deny it.\u201d\n\nI then start cleaning the house, baby on my hip, and he\u2019s sitting on the couch on his phone while my daughter plays pokemon.\n\nWas I supposed to just let him leave my baby crying in the car and my other kid hungry while he went to get alcohol because he decided he wanted a drink tonight? Was I really such an asshole and shitty wife for saying no and causing this whole blow up. I feel so resentful.\n\nTLDR: my husband wanted to go to the liquor store and I said no because I didn\u2019t want to sit in the car with my screaming baby and hungry child. This caused a blow up with him saying I should\u2019ve never come and that I\u2019m miserable and no one would put up with me.", "created_utc": 1704580006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190c24z/aita_for_denying_my_husband_an_alcohol_run_while/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also sounds like there might be some beneficial changes on the horizon with your husband\u2019s new position/hybrid schedule. But you guys need to find a balance in how to parent, fairly divide the labor, and maintain your relationship with each other, not just as parents to two young children.\n\nI get being frustrated at a crying baby.

I put responsibility on both of you but you want to blame him for your unhappy life.  Again, you BOTH need to figure out how to make it work.  Being a bitch will make it worse.", "You\u2019re the one who insisted on going with him.", "In that case, why do you live with him like that? You do childcare, handling everything else, you are working and he sits there and is not even good enough as a father to babysit? \n\nYou would have a better life if he moves out and you get a good babysitter and someone helping around the house for a few hours per week. \n\nYou need at least family counseling because you can't go on like that. He is not a bad babysitter, he is the father and he should know not to let a 5 months old baby cry for a longer timespan. He knows you will take care of it when he plays dumb.", "What have you seen him do on the average day?", "Well that accounts for most men. Very few are thoughtful or even perceptive. So I guess so.", "Nah I\u2019m not mad, just need every man to do his part. I did mine :)", "DUDE. I just said this too him, because he finally came to ask me if I needed help. And I said yeah, half an hour ago. And he\u2019s like, well I\u2019m not a mindreader! If you need help tell me. \n\nI\u2019ve told him already multiple times that literally all he needs to do is look, use his eyes, and look. What part of me holding a baby and cleaning doesn\u2019t scream, hmmm\u2026 she needs help.", "typical bitter, no love life, female response.  He's sitting on the couch eating chips, DIVORCE HIM !  So petty.", "No the correct advice is to address the husband's issues with him. Not get a divorce when you have a 5 month old. What husband is doing is awful but the answer isn't to become a single mother. \n\nYou ppl are ridiculous and incredibly short sighted.", "\"go feminist\" yta, bud. \n\nAnd still the question remains unanswered-- does the husband have to choose between children and a rewarding career?\n\nYou can't answer that you have no business mentioning anything here.", "Cringe", "Yes. I refuse to be housebound even on the weekends and even then there\u2019s a limit to how long. Literally my outing was a grocery store lol.", "There are lots of great men out there who are thoughtful.", "Absolutely not. It just means these women are settling", "That is not even a little bit true, men are no more a monolith than women are, everyone is different.", "It's time for the discussion about mental load with your husband, that not everyone is physical stress.", "This is the most enlightening description of the mental load we women carry\u2026and the \u201cyou should have asked\u201d men say. \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/26/gender-wars-household-chores-comic", "He doesn't need to be a mindreader, he needs to figure out how to be a contributing member of the household.\n\nYou should not have to ask for help raising the children or cleaning the house you both live in.", "[deleted]", ">he\u2019s like, well I\u2019m not a mindreader! If you need help tell me.\n\n>I\u2019ve told him already multiple times that literally all he needs to do is look, use his eyes, and look.\n\nSo, your husband literally told you to communicate because he\u2019s not a mind reader and your response was to tell him to be a mind reader. Make it make sense.\n\nThat\u2019s not telling him you need help. You need to work on your communication. How you\u2019re in a leadership position at the company you work for when you can\u2019t even communicate with your husband makes no sense.", "Why can\u2019t he stay home with the kids while you run to the grocery store?", "Dose he force you to work from home and stay with the kids? Or did you choose it?", "This should be given to all couples before they move in together.", "She should not have to ask for routine help with their children and house. That is putting all of the mental load on her, placing her in a position to be whined at and complained to when she does ask, and makes her effectively his parent assigning him chores rather than the partner who shares his life. He needs to step up himself.", "She is not his mother or his manager.", "This! \n\nAnd if you ask enough times he might even start picking up on when and in what situations you need help in and offer before you ask. Maybe you feel like you shouldn\u2019t have to ask, but people can be dense sometimes.\n\nClosed mouths don\u2019t get fed.", "Maybe, as he is a grown adult who lives in the same house, she should reasonably be allowed expect him to figure out which recurring tasks need doing? Why is it on her to supervise him?", "I can only say I need help with the same things so many times before it becomes a moot point.\n\nAs for my job, the people at my job have common sense I guess.", "No, it is telling him he needs to help when she's given him. Plenty of examples. She doesn't need to put those examples out here for everybody to know. Because it should be common sense that she is literally giving him examples already and has done so multiple times and at this point he needs to just open his eyes and look around and see like what normal people do. That's not even the bare minimum he's giving, Weaponize incompetence which is the problem that you're rolling over. She has communicated once you've done that so many times you eventually just stop even trying.  She's not doing anything wrong at this point, at least with this part.", "Mostly because I\u2019ve seen how he handles the baby and I worry he will just be crying the whole time I\u2019m gone and I feel bad thinking about that.", "Covid forced me to work from home and it became standard. He took a lower paying job and now childcare doesn\u2019t make sense from a financial perspective, but we both need to work. It is what it is.", "A serious conversion needs to be had for sure. They definitely aren\u2019t on the same page.", "Because maybe he sees her doing something and she doesn\u2019t say she needs help so he assumes it\u2019s fine. This is a serious communication issue. If it\u2019s communicated to him explicitly that she needs help and he still doesn\u2019t help, that\u2019s a different thing altogether.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what sort of relationship you\u2019re in, if you need help and don\u2019t communicate that you need help, and just expect the other party to *just know* when you need help, it\u2019s not going to work.\n\nEvery relationship requires communication and there is a clear breakdown of that in OP\u2019s description of this situation.", "It's not about 'help' because using that word shows that you have made those jobs all your own.  It's not just semantics.\n\nI think you two need some help from an outside source who can be objective and help you to communicate.", "If you\u2019re explicitly telling your husband that you need help with specific things and he\u2019s not helping, that\u2019s another issue altogether. But that\u2019s not how you described this.\n\nCommon sense isn\u2019t as common as its name suggests and the fact that you used that term is very telling of your current feelings towards your husband.\n\nAll I can tell from this it that there is something wrong at the root of your relationship and as someone above suggested and you said you mentioned to your husband also, couples therapy is likely the logical next step.\n\nThe communication issue is likely only the tip of the iceberg. I wish you the best of luck, for the sake of your own sanity and for your kids\u2019 relationships with their dad and of course your relationship with your husband.", "Sounds like you don't trust him with your children and are not being supported by him in any meaningful way either. So either go to couples counseling and work through it, go to couples counseling and separate, or just separate.", "I have someone very close to me who was in an identical situation to you. I have seen how ugly it can get, and how it affects the children.\n\nYou clearly care about your family. Please, please consider couples counselling. If not for you, for your kids. The worst that can happen is you realise this marriage will not work and you go separate ways and recalibrate. The best thing that can happen is you save yourself and your family a lot of resentment and lasting trauma.", "Sounds like you both need an adult night out just the two of you. Or ask someone to help watch the kids on a day off and pamper yourself", "Why do we act as though basic household chores and to-dos are somehow big mysteries that some people will only understand or grasp if someone spells it out for them? He's thirty, he's capable of understanding what needs to be done. On top of that she's just said in another comment that - surprise - she *has* said that she needs help with certain things in the past.", "You\u2019re not wrong. I\u2019ve been wanting to go watch a movie. Maybe we can do that soon or something.", "That sounds like a great idea. My parents hadn\u2019t been on a date alone for as long as I can remember. A few years ago I told my dad was taking my brother and going to a movie. He asked what he was supposed to do about dinner cause he already thawed the hamburger meat. I told him make hamburgers and pick a movie mom will like. Y\u2019all need a date. They haven\u2019t been on one since. So we all chipped in and got them tickets to Jeff Dunham later this year. He\u2019s taking her out to eat as well", "It really does seem that you have some cabin fever. Find time for yourself or as a couple. Maybe take a walk during the day, meet friends, anything really. I get it stresses you out leaving the kids with him. But, this is the man you chose as a partner and a father, twice. It may be worth talking to someone about it if the level of anxiety is high."]}
