Not like we were clocking it, we were just catching up and bullshitting amongst ourselves. Then 15 minutes minutes went by. Then 20.

Aren't you supposed to be saving our table?!?!\" And we see these two girls in the line to get drinks (even though they already had drinks at their table - and FYI this bar doesn't have wait service, you can only buy drinks at the counter). I say \"yeah but you didn't come back and we're ready to leave so.... sorry\". And they were like \"whatever dude. Nice. Well is anybody sitting at our table?\" I say \"no\" and they continue on \"well I hope no one steals our stuff\" and by now everyone in line is listening and I realize there is unwanted attention on me so I don't say another word. I just waved good-bye to them and walked off. They huffed in disbelief at our audacity.\n\nSo are my friend and I the assholes for leaving before the girls came back to the table?

You had no requirement to stay especially when it's impacting your night out . The fact they even mentioned drinks being roofied, and then boht left is unbelievable.. when I and bestie, F go out, 1 of us always stays with the table and drinks.. would never do this", "NTA... watching a table means bathroom or ynder 10 mins... ideally, one stays at table while others gets order or goes to bathroom and then they switch out...\n\n30 mins is 20mins longer than mine...", "\n\nNo, you're not the asshole. It was completely reasonable for you to assume that the girls weren't coming back and you wouldn't be waiting around all night for them. They should have been more mindful of the time and given you better instructions for what to do in case they didn't return. As far as etiquette, it's polite to watch someone's belongings if you are asked, but no-one should ever be relying on a stranger to do such a thing for an extended period of time.", "NTA Asking strangers to watch your stuff is something you do for a few minutes. So when you have to go to the bathroom for example. This was completely disrespectful on their part, they are not entitled to your time.", "NTA\n\nI think if 30mins thats abit too long, UNLESS the queue is 30mins long then you might have anticipated that. but generally 5-10mins is fine, longer than that and they should have given you a headsup first, unless of course everyone knows the queue is 30mins long \n\nbut as far as i know, it doesnt take 30mins to get a drink. so NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n25 minutes is unreasonably long.", "Are you and your friend male?\n\nIts such a weird ask I'm wondering if they hoped you;d stick around and hang out at their table after they got more drinks with them since it seemed unlikely you'd find your own?\n\nNTA, its still weird.", "I mean, they\u2019re women \u2615\ufe0f (lol) And they\u2019re probably drunk as hell so really no one is the asshole here realistically.", "YTA - should have waited for atleast an hour before deciding to leave.
