It was completely reasonable for you to assume that the girls weren't coming back and you wouldn't be waiting around all night for them. They should have been more mindful of the time and given you better instructions for what to do in case they didn't return. As far as etiquette, it's polite to watch someone's belongings if you are asked, but no-one should ever be relying on a stranger to do such a thing for an extended period of time.", "NTA Asking strangers to watch your stuff is something you do for a few minutes.
