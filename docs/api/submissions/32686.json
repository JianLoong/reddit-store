However, the girl I canceled with didn't know that and put a great deal of effort in.  I'd also woken up with a bad throat and could have canceled then but thought that it was just a chronic illness/cold room things and instead waited until far later in the day to cancel, at which time she'd already home cooked dinner and had her boyfriend buy a trivia game and a movie.  If this happened to me, I'd also probably be really upset, especially if it happened in such a tight timeframe.  Moreover, if I spent extra money trying to make the night more fun (IE buying a trivia game based for the people involved and cooking the favorite meal of the person coming) and they canceled suddenly, I think I'd be hurt or, at least, I'd think they were a flaky friend.  I understand getting sick last minute but normally it doesn't happen so quickly without warning and I'm not sure how to prove I was actually sick. Basically my friend did a lot for me and I canceled last minute and left her and her boyfriend really dissapointd but also put out.  I feel terrible and would like to know if IATA and, if so, how do I make this up or stop it from happening again?\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If I could go back, I'd text her that morning and say I woke up feeling unwell.  The short notice was, honesty, in part because I think it was a chronic thing and my medication would fix it.  When it didn't, it was too little, too late: I was sick and she had always gone all out preparing which anyone would be upset about.", "I completely get that, especially I waited for so long to say I wasn't coming.  After I woke up and took meds, I felt fine and it was only when we were texting I started to realize something was wrong.  \n\nI don't blame her if she feels it was fake.", "I agree so maybe while I'm not an obvious villain in this, I am a jerk.  I'm just sad it cost a friendship.", "I completely agree and I didn't really have this prescriptive until I started getting messages via this board.  The oneset of being sick came very fast as did the turn around.  I feel awful I didn't this to her and I understand why I'm wrong in this situation.  \n\nThis is the definition of Freudian Excuse is No Excuse but I always try to act healthier than I am to the last minute and then I crack when physical symptoms manifest.  I don't blame her for no longer wanting to associate and, maybe, because I've done this before with good intentions, I'm more forgiving about it but I still feel awful she and her BF did so much into making this a really great night.", "That's my thought too.  I woke up feeling not great but felt better not soon after so I chalked it into nothing.  \n\nIn hindsight, I wish more than anything I could go back to bed and immediately say I was having a flareup to what seems like my now ex-friend.  I did feel fine for most of the day without medication but that didn't remain the case, aka this post.  \n\nThis seems very fully of hypocrisy but I also hate last minute cancelers-I had a party of friends do it for Thanksgiving and ended up having to train to CT to meet another party.  However, I honestly didn't realize I was sick and that's why I feel worse.  She put in a lot of effort for this and I canceled hours before.", "I agree. It sounds like the OP\u2019s message was sincere and apologetic. People get sick, and sometimes it comes on suddenly.\n\nThe only mistake the OP may have made is to offer money. What I\u2019m sure was a considerate gesture on their part could have been perceived as thinking the friend was upset for monetary reasons.  But the OP wasn\u2019t feeling well and was doing their best in an awkward situation.\n\nHowever, friends, even new friends, should give each other the benefit of the doubt. The other person\u2019s reaction was unkind and extreme. I understand her disappointment, but I\u2019m not sure it would be a good idea to continue a friendship with someone so suspicious and unforgiving. I agree with you that the OP dodged a bullet.", "Thanks-this isn't actually something I've thought about regarding this situation until now. \n\nI've been unhappy on major holidays, such as Friendsgiving, when people have bailed last minute but gotten over it fairly quickly.  In part, that's because I do get sick a lot (chronically, not with what I have now) so I understand how things change and, often, quickly.  And it also may be because I'm a pushover.  \n\nBut at the end of the day, I really didn't realize I was sick-sick; I thought medication for chronic illnesses would cure it and I was trying to see our plans through in good faith.  \n\nUp until I apologized the 5th(?) ime and she started saying how much I disappointed her BF, I understood but after that, it seems like me being a people pleaser and her sort of using this over me and that part was unnessecary.  I wouldn't mean to waste someone's time but I also realize she doesn't get sick the way I do so it's also fair to assume she wouldn't react as nonchalantly as I do.  So I still think what I did makes me a jerk but also, I'm still sick now.", "Thank you.", "Thank you!"]}
