Your husband should be calling this behavior out directly to the AH.", "Nope, you are NTA and hopefully she will feel shit enough about him that he will be single again soon. Otherwise she gets to spend her life waiting for his next awful comment in public and knowing people are thinking exactly what you said out loud!", "NTA-- When will people learn that if you don't want to be called out for being a shitty person, don't be a shitty person?\nThe world needs more people like you that aren't going to let that shit slide just because it's uncomfortable-- it's uncomfortable to listen to homophobic slurs. \n\n\nAs a queer lady, thank you.", "NTA. But you can\u2019t be an ally to gays while loving a man who tolerates homophobic Bs from his best friend. He has to tighten up.", "NTA\n\n\nYou should never apologize for pointing out a bigots... bigotry. Either you opened her eyes to his homophobia that she may have been downplaying, or made her realize her fiance needs to keep that shit to himself better. Like a closeted homophobe", "His comments do not justify your lapse in manners.\n\nESH", "NTA. you were pretty tame.\n\ni would ask why it was you that had to call out that rude behavior. Your BF should have done it before you... and ask yourself why he ignores this behavior.", "NTA for your response but\u2026 girl you\u2019re dating someone who supports a homophone. Who hangs w a homophone. Who cares about a homophobe. What does that say about YOU?", "YTA", "NTA, But why are you with a man who befriends gross people like this?", " NTA. As the saying goes, all it takes for evil to triumph os for good people to say and do nothing.", "This!\n\nPeople don\u2019t just make \u201cjokes\u201d like this unless they know their audience. This means OP\u2019s bf and this guy\u2019s fianc\u00e9 have heard these types of comments before and either a) laughed, or b) said nothing at all. \n\nThis homophobic dude is a coward, like all homophobes, bigots, and racists. If anyone said anything to shut down his shit, he would not feel so comfortable about casually making these \u201cjokes\u201d.", "Totally agree. If she didn't want to feel embarrassed by him, don't be with someone that's embarrassing to be with?", ">I hate this. The word should be acceptable from everybody or nobody should use it at all. I think it's the same for the n word.\n\nI disagree strongly. And let me explain why. \n\nIt's all about context. A reclaimed slur is just that- a slur. Used by the community it's being targeted at, it can be a way of taking power back. Of acknowledging a shared marginalization and experience. Used by someone outside that sphere of marginalization, it's just a slur. There's no reclamation going on, because the words aren't used to target them. So it's just a tool to harm and harrass. The reason it's cool for one group to use it and not all is context and impact. The difference between a lighthearted roast among friends or even just a common greeting and an insult hurled your way. \n\nThis all or nothing thinking lacks nuance. Not everything has to be okay in every context. That doesn't mean it needs to be cut off outright. People, namely bigots, are going to use slurs whether it's considered okay or not, because they don't really care. So all the 'just make it never okay for anyone to do regardless of context' posturing will only end up policing marginalized people for trying to respond to their marginalization. \n\n>Maybe it's a cultural thing (I'm European, not American), but I think it's utterly ridiculous to use a word that you don't want to hear from others.\n\nIt likely is a cultural thing, but not across continents. A lot of times I hear this \"well it should always be okay or it should never be okay\" position, as well as the related \"everything's fair game to joke about or nothing is\" stance, from people who don't deal with a whole lot of marginalization in their day to day life. Not all, mind you. But it's a very common pattern. I think it comes from a lack of perspective on the actual real word power of language, both for good and for bad. But the truth is that life is never so black and white. And it's okay to acknowledge the shades of gray.", "What is the saying - if you\u2019re sitting at a table with nine nazis, there are ten nazis at the table. \n\nWell, if you\u2019re celebrating a friends birthday with one bigot, you\u2019ve got a birthday celebration full of homophobic bigots.", "Pacifism is not using violence. Calling someone's bigotry out doesn't always mean beating the shit out of them.", "NTA. Don't throw hands unless you want a fight!", "NTA but if this is your bfs best friend.... Well he probably makes jokes like that as well and is simply covering for you. \n\nI'm a trans woman and as someone who lived in male groups for years this is common. It doesn't bother me personally jokes are jokes... However that wasn't even a joke and your bf should have exploded on his friend if he actually cared.", "NTA. But if one homophobe is sitting at a table with 9 people, you have 10 homophobes at that table. It says a lot about someone who they choose to hang out with or befriend.", "NTA. My personal favorite response to something like that is \"What an odd thing to say out loud.\"", "NTA but it was nice of you to say something to Sarah.", "NTA, if I was in her position that's exactly what I'd have been thinking anyway and it's pretty clear it was.", "Bigots should be embarrassed and made to feel like shit whenever possible and people who tolerate that bullshit should likewise be embarrassed about the company they keep. NTA", "Well someone has to call him out on it, otherwise he'll keep doing it thinking it's perfectly acceptable. More people should do what you did!", "NTA- You went way easy on them! My (f) giant, former military, construction worker, boyfriend  watches it with me for the \"Big titties and savage comedy\". He really hates ignorant bullies. He'd have given that lad the full officer 'booming voice' dressing down, from 'insecure child' to 'you're a disgrace to the concept of masculinity' via 'deep personal weakness that is the polar opposite of the people you're badmouthing'. And he'd have done that because he's merciful, and he knows I am not... And worse, I've watched all the English language series at least three times, so I can read a man all the way to filth and put in a few solid chapters on the way home.", "Yeah, it's not exactly something you can shrug off. That's pretty disgusting behaviour.", "Do you also think there should be \"straight pride\" parades?\n\nWhen you and your community have literally been jailed, beaten, and killed by people who call you a word *as they are jailing, beating, and killing you*, YOU can decide who gets to use it. The trauma has EVERYTHING to do with it because the word goes hand in hand with people wanting to ELIMINATE YOUR VERY EXISTENCE.\n\nWhen another gay person uses it, it's different, because you know that they don't have violent intentions or desires towards every other gay person! It's literally that simple!\n\nEspecially since the rule in most queer spaces is \"don't use slurs on people who haven't consented to them\". So I'll call myself a tr*nny f*g, I'll call my best friend who thinks it's funny a d*ke, I'll call my partner who calls herself queer but doesn't like other slurs queer... it's about respect, decency, and safety. \n\nWhat an incredible privilege to have never had to fear for your life on the basis of an identity you have no control over. (Yes, even if you are marginalized in some way, as privilege also is dependent on things like *where you live* and how much money you make, etc). \n\nIt's not \"ridiculous\" to take back a knife that has your blood on it, to use it as you please in ways that DON'T hurt people, and still not want to see it in the hands of people who want to hurt you.", "No problem! It\u2019s a common phrase in schools, can\u2019t take credit myself", ">pacifist\n\nThat's a weird way to spell \"pathetic coward\" but to each their own with spelling, I guess\n\n>'bigotry'\n\nVERY interesting quote placement given that the dude literally said a slur to degrade a marginalized group\n\n>woke\n\nDelete your account and stop getting your opinions from manosphere podcasts"]}
