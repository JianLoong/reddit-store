I think it's the same for the n word.\n\nMaybe it's a cultural thing (I'm European, not American), but I think it's utterly ridiculous to use a word that you don't want to hear from others.", "Not calling him out on the otherhand only would have emboldened him because \"nobody ever objected before!\"", "Yes!!! This is what I was thinking!! If he\u2019s so \u201cdisgusted\u201d by his friend dropping slurs and homophobic comments like that, why hasn\u2019t he said anything to his friend or dropped his ass as a whole? I don\u2019t get it", "By your analogy (and by general reasoning), OP's BF - the homophobe's best friend, remember, who clearly knows what his friend is like and accepts that - is, well, very much a homophobe. \n\nIsn't it weird how OP is totally *fine* with her *boyfriend* tolerating his bestie's homophobia? How she just embarrasses the fiancee, but has no beef when her BF wants to hang out with his homophobic bestie? \n\nI'm sorry, there are absolutely zero non-homophobes at the table. There's only one person who thinks she's better than everyone else because she's pointing away from herself.", "You win the internet today.", "Are you serious?  There\u2019s a time and place to call out these things?  Yeah, there is.  IMMEDIATELY.  I\u2019m not coddling the feeling of bigots, racists, homophobes or other low life s because \u201cgood manners\u201d.", "Meh, Sarah\u2019s marrying a homophobe, so she\u2019s not innocent.", "The judgement you\u2019re looking for is E S H \ud83d\ude0a", "Agreed. Saying on the car ride home he mentioned he also didn't like the comments is not sufficient. Men NEED to speak up with other men or the horrific toxic masculinity will never end. He's as much of a bigot in my mind", "> I don't think OP should be patting herself on the back here until she has a serious talk with her fiance about why he is OK with his best friend's blatant homophobia.\n\nYou have misread. OP is not engaged, OP is with her boyfriend. The boyfriend's best friend is Sarah. It was Sarah's fiance that made the joke.\n\nETA: I misread, my apologies.", ">AITA for asking my sister to cover up when she leaves the bedroom?\n\nHomophobia is the most overused term I've ever heard.  Just because someone disagrees with something a LGBTQ person does, doesn't make them homophobic.  In fact, it might make them the most rational person in the group.", "I used to feel this way until I realized I was gay, and gained a circle of gay friends. We never use it towards one another in a mean or hurtful way, it\u2019s more about taking a negative label and giving it whatever meaning or power we want, and stripping the power from those who would use it in a derogatory fashion or who are otherwise homophobic.", "Seriously. OP's gathering all sorts of kudos for doing basically the absolute bare minimum against homophobia in such a way as to not upset her life with her homophobe-loving BF. <eyeroll>", "Thank you my savior \ud83d\udc96. I couldnt figure it out for he life of me", "Yup, and it's super questionable why OP gives *him* a free pass on his bigotry. *Really* makes me think she's posting here to get everyone's applause while still being *totally fucking fine* with homophobic bigots.", "NTA but you should not have went to his fianc\u00e9", "Second sentence of the post: \n\n>my boyfriend's best friend, Jack,\n\nI'll certainly change \"fiance\" to \"BF\". \n\nMy point still stands.", "Incorrect, try reading again.", ">it\u2019s more about taking a negative label and giving it whatever meaning or power we want, and stripping the power from those who would use it in a derogatory fashion\n\nBut you're doing the exact opposite... If you want to strip the term of the derogatory meaning you should own it, regardless of who uses it. If somebody who isn't gay uses the F word and your attitude says \"yeah, so what?\", that's a so much more powerful message than telling people they can't use the word because they mean it in a negative way. If you keep treating it as a negative word, people will keep using it as a negative word.", "It\u2019s confusing at first. I\u2019m honestly on here too much lol", "Ah, you just revealed your character and your values.  \n\n\nBecause they deleted their comment: u/Holiday-Pirate7204 just said that those are things that no one cares about.", "Shit, you're right. My apologies.", "Much pithier and with a delightful cadence. Thanks!", "respectfully, nah lol. allowing slurs doesnt deter their usage or change their meaning", "No honestly I was like what does this even mean. I go to google and type \u201cesh on reddit meaning\u201d.", "Cope.  You disableist .", "No, but that's not really what I'm getting at.  I'm just saying that whether to continue being an asshole or not is up to the asshole, not those of us who call them out on their shit.", "Fine, but then nobody should be allowed to use them.", ">Cope.  You disableist .\n\nGonna go ahead and preserve this too! You're on a roll. Awww, are you trying to \"trigger\" liberals? Try harder!", "I\u2019m wondering why you feel so strongly? Are you feeling left out?\n\nFor me, it just feels like common sense and the last thing I\u2019m going to do is police the use of a word that is used to insult and marginalize another group. They get to call the shots. Not me.", "Are you gay or black, user white-tornado?\nYou might be invited to participate in discussions (and this pov can change from one person to another), but defining what a demographic you\u2019re not a part of does with slurs used against them for decades to centuries is not your prerogative.", "Because it simply doesn't make any sense to let some people use it while others aren't allowed. I don't use the word personally and don't have any desire to, but if you do use it you shouldn't be telling other people they can't, regardless of their and your own sexuality.", ">Are you gay or black\n\nMy entire point is that that should be completely irrelevant, so I'm not going to answer that question.\n\nI'm not going to ask that question you just asked everytime I see or hear somebody use a slur, which is why my view is that either everybody can use it or nobody can use it. Either one is fine by me, I really don't care for using slurs myself.", "Yourself, like you said.\n\nSomeone else might have been deeply affected by it, at any given moment in time, to have a completely different view.\n\nAnd when whole communities targeted by such terms tend to have similar opinions, it might be that many of those people did get deeply affected by it."]}
