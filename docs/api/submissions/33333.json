She has been in multiple accidents, gotten several tickets, and even had her license suspended once. She is always reckless, distracted, and impatient on the road. She never learns from her mistakes and always blames others for her mishaps.\n\nLast week, she crashed her car into a tree while texting and driving. She was not seriously injured, but her car was totaled. She had no insurance, so she had to pay for the damages out of pocket. She also got a hefty fine and another suspension.\n\nShe called me and asked me if she could borrow my car until she gets a new one. She said she needs it for work, errands, and socializing. She promised to be careful and respectful with it. She also said she would pay for the gas and maintenance.\n\nI flat out refused. I told her there was no way I was letting her drive my car after what she did. I said she was irresponsible and untrustworthy, and that I didn't want to risk losing my car or getting in trouble because of her. I also said she should take public transportation, ride a bike, or walk instead of driving. I said she needs to face the consequences of her actions and learn to be more careful.\n\nShe got angry and called me a selfish jerk. She said I was being unreasonable and unsupportive. She said I was the only family member who could help her, since our parents live in another state and our brother is overseas. She said I was making her life harder and that I should be more compassionate.\n\nShe hung up on me and later sent me a bunch of nasty texts. She also told our mutual friends and relatives about our argument, and some of them sided with her. They said I was being too harsh and that I should help her out as a favor. They said she was going through a tough time and that I should be more understanding. They said family comes first and that I should lend her my car.\n\nI don't think I'm the asshole here. I think I'm being sensible and realistic. I don't want to enable her bad behavior or put myself in danger. I think she needs to grow up and take responsibility for her actions. I think she is being entitled and manipulative.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let my sister borrow my car after she crashed hers?", "created_utc": 1702955100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18lrji1/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_sister_borrow_my_car/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
