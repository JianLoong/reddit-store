Our marriage was ok but we were both different people in different places. He still acted very immature like we are 16 and kid less. About a year ago he married Mary 28F. She has a kid 1M from a previous relationship and her kid is sweet however I can see my kids be a little upset because Alex plays dad to this new baby but not even to his own kids. I think they feel betrayed like he doesn\u2019t love them. \n\nThe main issue is when we started planning a trip for my daughter. She wants to go on a little family vacation to a beach. due to financial issues last year I couldn\u2019t give her a big birthday so I told her this year we could do something big. She chose the place and a few activities and invites, I asked about if she was gonna invite her father and her response was \u201cI guess but he is not gonna come he has the baby\u201d my heart broke because I know she wants more quality time with her dad. She ended up inviting him and he sounded excited to come but now it\u2019s two weeks before the trip he starts asking about prices so we could split it. I told him I\u2019d be paying for me, our son and our daughter and he got really confused and started going on and on about how it was unfair to only include my kids and not Mary\u2019s kid. I made it very clear my daughter invited him not even Mary or her son, but they are welcome to come however I would not be paying for them or sharing a hotel so there was no reason to spilt the payment. He mentioned the fact the baby won\u2019t be able to do most of the activities so it would be cheaper for me but that\u2019s not the case because if we split for example the boat tour then I\u2019d be paying for the baby who doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on. Now he is all mad and acting like I can\u2019t possibly pay for all this with out him(I make more than him so I have no clue where this is coming form. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He's going to cancel last minute, so warn your daughter.", "NTA. Forget about inviting him. He cares more for his new family. It is that obvious because even your daughter sees it. If he does come, he should be responsible for him and the baby. In no way should his wife be hoping on this trip!!!!!!! But  I think he should not come on a trip because you are divorced he should definitely have a part in your daughters life but not your vacation!", "Why would you for a kid (and your exes girlfriend) that is not yours?! Wtf? Your ex is crazy for thinking thats a possibility. \n\nNTA. Your obligation is to your kids only. Sadly seems like you failed to choose a proper father to them. From what you said he is more concerned about is stepson (who is too small to even remember this trip) rather than is own daughter who he has been neglecting. \n\nMake this an amazing trip to your little girl, a trip that she never forgets! Maybe she will forget the trash father she got.", "What\u2019s there to split? You\u2019re 3 and they\u2019re 3, it\u2019s already even.\n\nAlso, does your daughter want them all to go?

It is her birthday after all.....", "NTA  I'd pull the plug right now, tell him the invite is for him only - I doubt your daughter wants him along so he can ignore her.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s ridiculous. You\u2019re paying for yourself and your children. The fact that you\u2019ve even invited him is ONLY to benefit your daughter. He can pay his own way and if he invites along people who weren\u2019t invited he can pay for them too.", "Well, we all know why you divorced him.  I know where it's coming from.  You likely let him do stupid stuff like that while you were married.  Stand our ground.", "NTA but is your math right? If he wants to split it, that's 3 and 3, plus the baby probably won't get charged for most things.", "NTA\n\nYour ex should be covering his expenses entirely. Whether that is just him, him and the step child, or him, his wife, and her child. In addition why isn't he covering half of the expenses for his biological daughter? He doesn't have to cover half of her total trip expenses but he should be paying half of her birthday party/excursion, etc on her birthday. At a bare minimum he should have offered to help pay for something towards his child's birthday celebration. \n\nAt this point uninvite him and let him know that is may be easier in the future if he plans his own birthday celebration for each of his children.", "I'm so confused as to what the issue is?\n\nOP wants to pay for herself and her two kids, and have her ex pay for himself, his wife and his wife's child. So basically they are each paying for three people..... each paying half.\n\n\nHer ex wants to pay for all six people as a group and split the bill on half..... so each paying half.\n\n\nWhat's the fight about? Just the semantics?", "NTA. Why would Mary and her baby even be invited? So your kids can watch their father give all his attention to someone else\u2019s kid in a new and exciting location?", "NTA if he made a promise  to mary to \"raise\"  her kid like his own, thats between them, you have no obligation to do such thing!\n\nEdited to scratch my confusion, it is his biological 1 year old son that he is mad op is not paying for ? forreal? so good he is an ex.. too bad it's still long untill both ur kids reach 18 so u wouldnt have to deal as much with him", "Why are people so entitled??? I can see why you divorced him. Definitely NTA!!", "NTA. You're already being overly generous by inviting him.", "It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he was setting this up to not go and somehow make it out to be her fault (at least from their daughter\u2019s perspective). Deadbeat parents are infuriating.", "This! NTA.", "It's only misogyny if you would have a different view if the genders were reversed. ie. a man with two kids not wanting to pay/split cost for his ex-wife's new partner and stepchild to go on a trip.", "I left it totally up to her it was her birthday trip after all but I did warn her about she knows how it is", "I asked about her dad because it\u2019s for her birthday and he said months prior he wanted to go I also told her if she didn\u2019t wanna say anything we didn\u2019t have to", "its not about his new wife and his baby kid, it's about his new wife's kid( his stepkid...)\n\nScratch that,,, it is about his 1 year old son with marry but even so.. he either sucks at math or he wants her to pay half his bill.... because like that its already  more than half on op's bill as she pays for acomodations for 3 people+tickets", "This is what I couldn\u2019t understand. If they split everything 50/50 she\u2019d still be paying for the 3 of them that she is already going to pay.", ">the fight is about him going half on his expenses, not on hers.", "I\u2019d tell your ex that only he\u2019s invited (if daughter wants that), not his new wife nor her child (even if he pays for them). \n\nYour daughter deserves a celebration of her, not spending a few days watching her dad play daddy to another child. \n\nI think you need to have a very detailed talk with your 16 year old to find out what she wants/needs you to do in case her dad shows up with his new family. Does she want him to be included, even if that means his new wife and her child? Does she want only her father to be included, which means you have to be hard ass enforcer of the boundaries? Does she not want him there at all now? If so, who is the one to tell him that? \n\nGood luck and try to have a good time on your family trip.", "\"now it\u2019s two weeks before the trip he starts asking about prices so we could split it.\"\n\nI'm confused is he asking for you to pay for him or is he trying to pay and split it with you?\n\nIf it's you bring 3 people (you, son daughter) and he brings 3 people ( him, wife, baby) and you split it 50% that seems fair?", "Unless her ex expected her to pay for half of the rest of his family as well, which would be ludicrous.", "Is this even real??", "YTA for karma fishing. Looking at your post history, you were 20 just 18 hours ago.  How did you manage to age 14 years in 18 hours?", "According to this post she's 34F with two kids 16F and 12M.\n\nOPs past post describes herself as a 20F with a toddler of 2M.  \n\nEx remains a doofus in both", "NTA.  He can pay for himself and his wife,  the child will probably not cost anything.  He's quite selfish.", "YTA.  He is separate from you and remarried.  There was no reason to invite him on this trip.  There is no reason to expect him to travel without his wife and her child.  You set your child up for disappointment.  You.  That is all 100% on you.", "NTA. Make sure he knows that you are never offering to pay for him, his wife or his wife's child for any reason. If he invites them somewhere, he should always expect to pay for his family. Be careful with the messaging that gets back to your daughter. He is probably going to tell your daughter he *wants to go*, but MOM won't let him, blah, blah, blah.", "Another example of why he\u2019s an ex.

Also NTA because NYP (not your problem).", "NTA\n\nYou ex is a grown ass man. Why would you be paying for him at all? He should be paying for half the cost for the kids. You pay your own way.

Let him pay for half of you and the kids too", "NTA and also I would have straight up said only HE is invited.", "NTA but man, how pathetic for a 38yo with *three* kids to still be such a whiny teenager?\n\nHell, if he could get away with it, I'm sure he'd try to make you pay for him and his wife (or to take *his* child along without either parent).\n\nAt least your kids have you on their side, because your daughter already knows the deal with her father.", " NTA - I think you need to be very clear with him, it\u2019s an opportunity to be there for his daughter in a way he never has before and it\u2019s important for her to feel like her dads attention is on her and her alone. If he doesn\u2019t want to go it will ruin his relationship with her but that is not on you. Do not even allow Mary or their son to come. This if for your daughter and what she wants. Also, don\u2019t let him guilt your daughter into anything!", "NTA - Honestly.. wtf is up with this bs. That's HIS wife and his  stepbaby, HIS responsibility. Why would he even be entitled to a free trip for his family on YOUR dime??? HE should be the one splitting the cost with you for the daughter and son that you share, whom of which are also HIS responsibility.", "Yeah, your daughter has his number all right, soon to be blocked and thrown into the trash where he belongs.", "If he wants to bring wife and kid, it will defeat the purpose of his daughter getting to spend more time with him.\n\nThere needs to be a conversation regarding his alienating his older children and the consequences it can have on him and his children.", "What makes him so entitled that he thinks you are going to pay half his new family's way?\n\nTell your daughter before he does.  Because he will blame you for not being able to come.\n\nNTA", "Wait. He wants to share a hotel with you and your kids plus his new kid from his new marriage? Would his new wife be sharing the room too? How awkward.\nAlso if he wants to split the cost of activities for the kids. That's great. Tell him what he owes to cover the cost of your shared children. Not sure why you would pay his baby. Infants are usually free if they can participate at all.", "Nta but did you ask your daughter about inviting Mary and the kid? He can go on a trip with his daughter.", "I'm not sure why you said he could bring Mary and her son. Your daughter didn't invite them and I highly doubt she wants to see her dad focusing on them during her trip.", "NTA. No is a complete sentence. You have explained everything you need to explain. He is a grown man and you shouldn't have to repeat yourself. He of course is hoping you will feel bad and cave. I would text him so you have it in writing and say something along the lines  of \"as per our conversation I will not be paying for your wife and her child to come on our trip. Please let me know what you decide to do by x date. If I don't hear back by then I will assume none of yall will be able to make it\"  Do not answer his calls or any calls from his wife, because she's going to call. Tell your daughter what is going on and be firm that this trip is to spend time with her, not to give her stepmother and stepsister a free trip so that he can play \"Daddy\" and ignore your daughter until he and the new wife want a babysitter.", "NTA. Take your invite back, this is too much trouble, just go with your kids.", "So he actually expects you to pay for his holiday and his wife's child...?\n\nHe has some brass neck as we say.\n\nNTA", "I can see why you divorced him.

Ask him for half towards your shared kids.", "The weird thing is if they did it his way op would probably end up paying close to the same amount considering he wants to bring his new wife and the baby. Yeah maybe somethingd might be cheaper but things like the boat tour would end up at 6 tickets instead of 3 for just her and her kids. So she would still be paying for 3 tickets when splitting the cost and would also have to deal with her ex, her ex new wife, a baby, and her potentially disappointed kids. Considering all that I doubt the probably small amount of money she would save would be worth it.", "I don't think that is misogyny!", "Yeah they were mostly invited out of courtesy my daughter didn\u2019t want to just invite her dad because she feared he wouldn\u2019t show up", "Only an AH karma fishes and this OP is a karma fishing AH. Edit spelling.", "He can win. He can bring them, he just needs to pay for his wife and baby.", "Oh he's definitely setting up the situation so he can blame OP.   Except I don't think he cares much about the daughter's perspective either way -  I think he just wants to internally blame OP so he doesn't have to acknowledge how shitty a father he is to his first kid.", "At least your kids have you on their side, because your daughter already knows the deal with her father.", "When I first started reading this post, I thought the ex wanted a chance to pay half of his kids' way.

I don't believe he wanted to pay pay for his kids or OP because it's already covered. It's really just weird", "Why did you allow dad to be invited in the first place?! Dad has a new family, ofc if he goes on a vacation the whole (new) family goes. You set up totally unrealistic expectations for your daughter, and are now upset that those expectations aren't being realised... You are the adult, you should have set the reasonable and realistic boundary that mom and dad are now divorced, and that means having two different families now and those families will celebrate separately. \n\nIt's totally reasonable for you to expect dad would pay for his and his family's own way, but by giving your daughter the option to invite him (which, ofc she wasn't going to risk hurting his feeling by not inviting her father!) you put the onus of complicated adult relationships on a 16 year old. Happy birthday to her.", "I don't think so, because the ex made the comment that OP can't afford this trip without him, and that the baby actually makes it cheaper.\n\nThat makes no sense unless his plan was to take the total and split it, thinking that he was lowering her \"half\".", "True, but if the wife starts making things about the baby, and trying to change activities to suit the baby, then OP\u2019s kids feel the same way they always do about the situation.", "Dad was the only one invited, new wife and baby were invited by dad", "But then there is no reason to talk about any kind of split. She's covering herself, daughter, and son. They're going and doing the activities regardless of whether dad joins or not. He is responsible for paying for himself.
