Our marriage was ok but we were both different people in different places. He still acted very immature like we are 16 and kid less. About a year ago he married Mary 28F. She has a kid 1M from a previous relationship and her kid is sweet however I can see my kids be a little upset because Alex plays dad to this new baby but not even to his own kids. I think they feel betrayed like he doesn\u2019t love them. \n\nThe main issue is when we started planning a trip for my daughter. She wants to go on a little family vacation to a beach. due to financial issues last year I couldn\u2019t give her a big birthday so I told her this year we could do something big. She chose the place and a few activities and invites, I asked about if she was gonna invite her father and her response was \u201cI guess but he is not gonna come he has the baby\u201d my heart broke because I know she wants more quality time with her dad. She ended up inviting him and he sounded excited to come but now it\u2019s two weeks before the trip he starts asking about prices so we could split it. I told him I\u2019d be paying for me, our son and our daughter and he got really confused and started going on and on about how it was unfair to only include my kids and not Mary\u2019s kid. I made it very clear my daughter invited him not even Mary or her son, but they are welcome to come however I would not be paying for them or sharing a hotel so there was no reason to spilt the payment. He mentioned the fact the baby won\u2019t be able to do most of the activities so it would be cheaper for me but that\u2019s not the case because if we split for example the boat tour then I\u2019d be paying for the baby who doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on. Now he is all mad and acting like I can\u2019t possibly pay for all this with out him(I make more than him so I have no clue where this is coming form.

He's going to cancel last minute, so warn your daughter.", "NTA. Forget about inviting him. He cares more for his new family. It is that obvious because even your daughter sees it. If he does come, he should be responsible for him and the baby. In no way should his wife be hoping on this trip!!!!!!! But  I think he should not come on a trip because you are divorced he should definitely have a part in your daughters life but not your vacation!", "Why would you for a kid (and your exes girlfriend) that is not yours?! Wtf? Your ex is crazy for thinking thats a possibility. \n\nNTA. Your obligation is to your kids only. Sadly seems like you failed to choose a proper father to them. From what you said he is more concerned about is stepson (who is too small to even remember this trip) rather than is own daughter who he has been neglecting. \n\nMake this an amazing trip to your little girl, a trip that she never forgets! Maybe she will forget the trash father she got.", "What\u2019s there to split? You\u2019re 3 and they\u2019re 3, it\u2019s already even.\n\nAlso, does your daughter want them all to go?

It is her birthday after all.....", "NTA  I'd pull the plug right now, tell him the invite is for him only - I doubt your daughter wants him along so he can ignore her.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s ridiculous. You\u2019re paying for yourself and your children. The fact that you\u2019ve even invited him is ONLY to benefit your daughter. He can pay his own way and if he invites along people who weren\u2019t invited he can pay for them too.", "Well, we all know why you divorced him.  I know where it's coming from.  You likely let him do stupid stuff like that while you were married.  Stand our ground.", "NTA but is your math right? If he wants to split it, that's 3 and 3, plus the baby probably won't get charged for most things.", "NTA\n\nYour ex should be covering his expenses entirely. Whether that is just him, him and the step child, or him, his wife, and her child. In addition why isn't he covering half of the expenses for his biological daughter? He doesn't have to cover half of her total trip expenses but he should be paying half of her birthday party/excursion, etc on her birthday. At a bare minimum he should have offered to help pay for something towards his child's birthday celebration. \n\nAt this point uninvite him and let him know that is may be easier in the future if he plans his own birthday celebration for each of his children.", "I'm so confused as to what the issue is?\n\nOP wants to pay for herself and her two kids, and have her ex pay for himself, his wife and his wife's child. So basically they are each paying for three people..... each paying half.\n\n\nHer ex wants to pay for all six people as a group and split the bill on half..... so each paying half.\n\n\nWhat's the fight about? Just the semantics?", "NTA. Why would Mary and her baby even be invited? So your kids can watch their father give all his attention to someone else\u2019s kid in a new and exciting location?", "NTA if he made a promise  to mary to \"raise\"  her kid like his own, thats between them, you have no obligation to do such thing!", "Why are people so entitled??? I can see why you divorced him. Definitely NTA!!", "NTA. You're already being overly generous by inviting him.", "It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he was setting this up to not go and somehow make it out to be her fault (at least from their daughter\u2019s perspective). Deadbeat parents are infuriating.", "This! NTA.", "It's only misogyny if you would have a different view if the genders were reversed. ie. a man with two kids not wanting to pay/split cost for his ex-wife's new partner and stepchild to go on a trip.", "I left it totally up to her it was her birthday trip after all but I did warn her about she knows how it is", "I asked about her dad because it\u2019s for her birthday and he said months prior he wanted to go I also told her if she didn\u2019t wanna say anything we didn\u2019t have to", "its not about his new wife and his baby kid, it's about his new wife's kid( his stepkid...)", "This is what I couldn\u2019t understand. If they split everything 50/50 she\u2019d still be paying for the 3 of them that she is already going to pay.", ">the fight is about him going half on his expenses, not on hers.", "I\u2019d tell your ex that only he\u2019s invited (if daughter wants that), not his new wife nor her child (even if he pays for them). \n\nYour daughter deserves a celebration of her, not spending a few days watching her dad play daddy to another child. \n\nI think you need to have a very detailed talk with your 16 year old to find out what she wants/needs you to do in case her dad shows up with his new family. Does she want him to be included, even if that means his new wife and her child? Does she want only her father to be included, which means you have to be hard ass enforcer of the boundaries? Does she not want him there at all now? If so, who is the one to tell him that? \n\nGood luck and try to have a good time on your family trip.", "\"now it\u2019s two weeks before the trip he starts asking about prices so we could split it.\"\n\nI'm confused is he asking for you to pay for him or is he trying to pay and split it with you?\n\nIf it's you bring 3 people (you, son daughter) and he brings 3 people ( him, wife, baby) and you split it 50% that seems fair?", "Unless her ex expected her to pay for half of the rest of his family as well, which would be ludicrous."]}
