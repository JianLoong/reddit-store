Don't let awkwardness with Gerald make you change your plans/schedule. He'll likely leave you alone from now on, unless he decides to apologize.\n\nI will agree with a piece of advice someone else gave you to work your marriage into conversation. When I was dating, I found that guys will either focus on marriage or boyfriends. By that I mean, you meet a guy & they'll either ask if you're married or if you have a boyfriend. If you say no, but don't elaborate, then it's game on for them, like the other relationship status doesn't exist.

You are not there to coddle his fragile, misogynist ego.\n\nYou're within your right to ask not to be in the same classes as him but be prepared for a possible no.\n\nGoing forward, I'd suggest wearing one of those rubber rings on your wedding finger. They're made specifically for people that work with their hands and will break or bend if they get stuck on something (so you don't run the risk of losing, degloving a finger) I know a lot of plumbers who opt for that option. \nIs it shitty and stupid that you have to take this measure? Yep, absolutely, but it might help you avoid something like this in the future.

I do have a female professor for my electrical class this semester so I think I will maybe go to her and explain.

I feel like maybe I should\u2019ve worn my big sparkly engagement ring and flashed it around the first day to make it clear, but I figured no one would take me seriously in such a male dominated field if I came in wearing flashy jewelry that could get my finger degloved in an accident.

I would sometimes skip on wearing my wedding band even before I started school because of sensory issues (which my lovely husband thankfully understands and never made me feel bad about it). But maybe the silicone would be more comfortable on my finger, I already saw my husband get excited when I told him about it and he thought I could go back to wearing a ring all the time instead of just when we go out.

No woman *owes* a man a got-damn thing, not her marital status info, not her time, certainly not her body. Gerald\u2019s entitlement is pathetic and concerning, and all on him.

It came across as if they believed I owed Gerald a date/chance/romance just because he was nice to me for a few months and we studied together in the library (with other classmates too) a couple of times. \n\nBut I do see your point that he\u2019s probably just embarrassed/defending himself. It just mostly put me off that he got angry at me for \u201clying\u201d and I didn\u2019t understand where the anger was coming from, if I had accidentally caused it, etc.", "Thank you, I mentioned this to my husband too (of course). A lot of my problem with socializing is obviously missing social queues/contracts \u2013 growing up I was always the kid who couldn\u2019t gauge my levels of emotional intimacy with people, so I would constantly over share and then create awkward situations which gave me horrible anxiety. My parents always just blamed it on me being weird and needing to try harder to \u201cuse my manners\u201d, so I masked it by disengaging with everyone instead of getting actual help. \n\nNow I\u2019m unpacking things in therapy but it\u2019s still a process and I am still pretty socially inept (which ironically is what made my husband fall in love with me, he says I was just so quirky and always made him smile when I\u2019d be too blunt with people on accident). Some of my therapy has been roleplaying social interactions with my husband, so he suggested that we could practice some ways for me to \u201ccasually\u201d drop in being married. I found that I can understand interactions better if I have some sort of idea of how it\u2019s supposed to go. Maybe that is a little crazy of me but it works.", "These fields are changing.

I really like Enso rings (the thinner kind) but there are some other good brands out there too. I have some sensory issues as well and silicone rings are more comfortable for me (barely notice it\u2019s there) so that\u2019s actually the only thing I wear instead of wedding bands.

Even a silicone ring can cause you to get hurt if there are opportunities for your hands to be near moving parts.  \n\nIf you want to wear it on a short necklace or something, that's cool, but your hands cannot be replaced without losing a ton of functionality. Your dearest love will want you to be safe more than he would care about any symbol of what you both know in your hearts.\n\nI'm just a stranger of the internet, but I'm also a femme person in a masc-dominated field, so I get how it can suck and understand wanting a solution to avoid stupid accusations in the future. Sadly, even a ring won't stop some dudes.\n\nJust food for thought, because you sound like you have a promising future in your chosen field.", "Is there a reason that course enrollments should be private? I don't know. Basically every course these days has online enrollment, and tells you that there were 35 spots of which 11 are currently available or something.\n\nIf the same computer system offered any student a list of those enrolled, would that be bad? It would enable people like OP to not choose the course that Gerald chose, but it would also enable toxic stalkers to follow their victims around campus. So maybe \"just make the information public and let people sort themselves out\" is a bad idea.\n\n(I do this with training courses at work. The list of attendees is public, and I pick the one that has people I like or will enjoy doing a course with.)\n\nWhich means that if the enrollment lists aren't public, what you're asking for is that OP  be able to go to an admin person and ask \"has Gerald registered for this course yet, and can you tell me which section he's in so I can select the other one\". Which is doable if few people are doing it, but gets ridiculous if more than a few are doing it. And it also means that if Gerald happens to be late registering then OP gets screwed because she has to delay her choices until after Gerald has chosen.\n\nThe third option is the nuclear option - go to admin, declare a major conflict between OP and Gerald, and require Gerald not to take any section that OP is in. That's a significant constraint on Gerald, and a lot of work for admin, and would require a determination of significant ongoing conflict between OP and Gerald. If, for example, OP had accused Gerald of rape, then it could certainly be a condition of allowing Gerald to remain on campus that he didn't take any classes that OP took. I don't think Gerald's one time incel rant rises to the level necessary to trigger this sort of action.", "I think that ASKING if it is POSSIBLE should be normalized.
