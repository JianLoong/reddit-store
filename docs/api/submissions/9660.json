I\u2019m sure what you said to him hurt a lot less than the realization that you and your family can\u2019t lean on him in such a difficult time. It is not fair that he makes you responsible for the few things you asked of him *and* his ego.", "NTA. Your further comments outline he had no intention of seeing to their dental needs, but is capable of remembering his own.\n\nIf you've got a degenerative illness and are still running the house by yourself, he's more dead weight at this point. \n\nI'd simply live as if he's not there. Don't count on him, or adjust for his schedule. It'll be less stress for you in the long run. To that end if it's easier, let him pick up the slack for himself though (laundry, meal for himself etc).

Why aren't you blaming him for not asking for the details of these responsibilities he agreed to take on? And for those of you saying \"but I have MS too and I can...\"... Stop.

He does suck at being a father and husband - his job is to be a partner and provide care for the kids. You asked for appointments - which are what, every six months for checkups, maybe 2-3 months for orthodontia? - even if he had said \u201cI can\u2019t schedule them but I can take them\u201d, it would have been better. But he failed as a husband to communicate with his wife. \n\nAs for the documents? All he had to do with put them in a safe. Done. Easy.

He didn\u2019t even come and offer to take something of your plate, you had to ask, which means he wasn\u2019t paying attention to you and your needs. That in itself is pretty bad husband behaviour. But then he failed to follow through with his promises, even though neither of his tasks were super challenging and he could have very easily asked for further directions, further heaping stress on you, for no reason.

They would have been safe where they were.

So, to see that your asks were orthodontist appointments and keeping up with birth certificates, I feel like maybe there's a lot more that was being asked than just that, or he's already doing a lot. And, while asking more than that is definitely reasonable as he's supposed to be a 50/50 partner and parent, it can also get overwhelming if you are the spouse of someone that is chronically ill, and you are saddled with both your normal responsibilities and a lot of theirs too. \n\nI feel like nobody can win with chronic illness. It's stressful for everybody involved. And if your husband is doing a lot, but he's forgotten where he put some documents, or dentist appointments escaped his notice for a few months (twice a year is typical, so not seeing for a year seems like he just forgot a single reschedule) then I think you've gone too far to say what you said.  \nBut if he's a deadbeat in all ways, and this was just the icing, then you were more than justified.", "YTA. That is not the way to handle it. Your husband may not honestly know how often the kids are supposed to have these appointments or time got away from him.
