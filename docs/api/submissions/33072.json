On top of that, anyone that you bring to a business event/any event reflects you as a person, if they disrespect everyone, that might look bad on you because of your association with that person.

She should stay home at this point.", "NTA- like everyone else is saying being introverted isn\u2019t an excuse to be rude. If she can\u2019t smile, be nice, and speak when asked a question then she needs to stay home.", "NTA. But I would rephrase it. Telling her she \"can't behave\" sounds condescending and makes her sound like a child. Her behavior is childish, but you're still married to this person, so a more tactful way to say it is just something like, how she clearly didn't enjoy it and didn't engage with anyone.

While it may not be right, her behavior will reflect poorly on you and can definitely affect your reputation at work, and could also indirectly affect your career prospects.  At my previous job, we had a high performing salesman who was very well liked, but his wife was what could best be described as a raging alcoholic.   At every work event and social outing to which he was invited, she would come along and, after a few hours, she would be drunk, get really loud, and become rather inappropriate.  It was super embarrassing for him, and over time people stopped inviting him to events that were not work related.  After a while, he stopped bringing her to work events.

Her misrepresenting you, not caring that she misrepresented you, and getting angry when you excluded her in response for showing the lack of care and respect towards you is extremely disrespectful and uncaring. Let her know that her being there the previous year made you uncomfortable, not because she was there, but because her behavior and lack of care in representing you in a positive manner caused your colleagues to worry and recognize her behavior as extremely negative. Along with the fact that she isn\u2019t being accountable for accepting that she did anything wrong and not taking on the responsibility of atoning for her behavior by working to better herself, it means that you do not feel you can trust her to represent you properly in a professional atmosphere where you want to stand out for positive reasons to advance your career. Tell her that she broke your trust in that area of your life, and if she wants to earn that trust back she has to give some effort to better herself or you\u2019re not going to include her in that part of your life.

Not only that, but she taught her daughter to disregard and disrespect him the same way, and he tolerated it until his daughter became an adult before divorcing her. You need to tackle this now, confront her and stop giving her the attention by excluding her, and continue to not reward towards for any negativity that she throws your way, if she displays positive behaviors then rewards her with attention. Excluding her is the right choice and all you need to do now is to stop showing her attention and affection for her bad behaviors, don\u2019t start showing it again until she starts being positive in her behaviors again. But, keep on excluding her from events like this until she shows she a desire to make an effort, otherwise the behavior won\u2019t change.
