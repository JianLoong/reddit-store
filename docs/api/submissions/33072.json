If she can\u2019t smile, be nice, and speak when asked a question then she needs to stay home.", "NTA. But I would rephrase it. Telling her she \"can't behave\" sounds condescending and makes her sound like a child.

At my previous job, we had a high performing salesman who was very well liked, but his wife was what could best be described as a raging alcoholic.   At every work event and social outing to which he was invited, she would come along and, after a few hours, she would be drunk, get really loud, and become rather inappropriate.  It was super embarrassing for him, and over time people stopped inviting him to events that were not work related.  After a while, he stopped bringing her to work events.

Her misrepresenting you, not caring that she misrepresented you, and getting angry when you excluded her in response for showing the lack of care and respect towards you is extremely disrespectful and uncaring. Let her know that her being there the previous year made you uncomfortable, not because she was there, but because her behavior and lack of care in representing you in a positive manner caused your colleagues to worry and recognize her behavior as extremely negative. Along with the fact that she isn\u2019t being accountable for accepting that she did anything wrong and not taking on the responsibility of atoning for her behavior by working to better herself, it means that you do not feel you can trust her to represent you properly in a professional atmosphere where you want to stand out for positive reasons to advance your career. Tell her that she broke your trust in that area of your life, and if she wants to earn that trust back she has to give some effort to better herself or you\u2019re not going to include her in that part of your life.

Not only that, but she taught her daughter to disregard and disrespect him the same way, and he tolerated it until his daughter became an adult before divorcing her. You need to tackle this now, confront her and stop giving her the attention by excluding her, and continue to not reward towards for any negativity that she throws your way, if she displays positive behaviors then rewards her with attention. Excluding her is the right choice and all you need to do now is to stop showing her attention and affection for her bad behaviors, don\u2019t start showing it again until she starts being positive in her behaviors again. But, keep on excluding her from events like this until she shows she a desire to make an effort, otherwise the behavior won\u2019t change.

Why does she suddenly want to go? Figuring that out will help you resolve the underlying issue.\n\n2. Introverted people struggle with small talk. This is just a thing. If you have specific expectations, you need to communicate beforehand.\n\n3. You need to stop infantilizing your wife. Instead of working things out, you seem more interested in belittling her.\n\nOn her side:\n\nA. She needs to understand that this isn't a normal social event. It's more like a job interview with snacks.\n\nB: By going, she needs to understand that she is part of that job interview and so has to adhere to a specific social code. \n\nC: It sounds like she's not used to that form of socializing. Playing on your phone is fine in many instances. She needs to realize this isn't one of them. \n\nSo either she agree to the rules that you carefully outline, or she can't go. Maybe it would be better to find something else you can do together.", "ESH. Your choice of words is insulting and infantilizing. She's not a child who is misbehaved. She is a grown woman. He does not enjoy socializing with people that she doesn't know. you are right to leave her home. you are wrong to make it sound like she's a kid. She shouldn't be complaining. She knows how she acted and how little she enjoys these events. Her job there is to be your ally and help make you look good. If she doesn't want to do that, she has no role there. \nEnjoy your time by yourself.", "YTA, \n\nIf you love your wife so much like you say, you would know already how she is and should not be surprised how she acts to events like this. If she is an introvert, then you would already know those type of people hate making small talk and socializing. My wife hates social environments and if I had  asked her to go to something like this, I would have had the expectation that she would be uncomfortable. And make her as comfortable as I could. You are just mad because you have this perceived idea that the higher ups care. They don't. Its just an event. Don't be surprise if she is angry at you.", "Curious.. is she autistic?", "Soft YTA for your wording. I think instead if \u201cyou can\u2019t behave\u201d something like \u201cyou don\u2019t appear or seem to enjoy yourself\u201d and you could follow up with the actions you mentioned in your post. The former sounds like youre scolding a child, not your partner.", "I think the issue is not that she \"cannot behave\", because she is not a naughty child to be corrected, but that she's underestimating the importance for you. I would too, because I hate small talk and these big fake events where you pretend you're rich and successful, just to impress people and it's just a charade to me. \nBut it's important to you, so she could at least cosplay as extrovert business woman who has a very successful self-made business she is fortunate enough to be able to practice in the comfort of her home office and joke about how much better the coffee is. \nIf she isn't able to, because it sucks to do this and frankly I think too it's ridiculous, she should indeed stay home. \nBUT the way you're talking about it makes it seem you're literally ashamed of her and that you're like her dad telling her to behave. \nMaybe you could learn something from her attitude and not get too impressed by hierarchies at work and let her help you see through the fakery. \nAnyway... judgement... ESH. You how you worded it and she for not having made an effort the last time. \nGo alone and talk about it later.", "To deny and reject your wife as if you\u2019re ashamed of her is terrible. Those vows you made on the wedding day, they were just words only. The commitment and oath taken empty. When you fell in love with her you did so accepting the good and bad in her. On that day I bet she told herself she\u2019d never have to fight life alone anymore, to have a true best friend.", "The way you talk about her makes me think we have an unreliable narrator here. YTA.", "It's called growing apart. Either she's ok with you going alone, or she needs to make an effort if she wants to go. What's not ok is to demand to go, only to continue acting like that. If that's the case, then I'd say you might be better off without her as you'll have grown too far apart without the understanding to respect each other in the process.", "YTA. You care more about your image than your wife\u2019s feelings. She\u2019s introvert, so it\u2019s not easy fir her to start conversations. Did anyone at the party (encouraged by you, maybe) talk to her about something that she could actually chime in? Something that she had the comfort to chitchat about? From the look of it, she didn\u2019t and just played with her phone to avoid boredom. But you can\u2019t see that since you\u2019re too busy maintaining your image.\n\nYou should\u2019ve let her choice if she wanted to go again to the boring party or not. Telling her she\u2019s not invited cause she ruined your image is very, very cruel.", "Anyone who infantilizes their spouse as someone who \"can not behave\" is the ah, automatically. Your wife is a shy introvert, my dude. She's uncomfortable with large groups of people, especially people she doesn't know. She's not misbehaving. She's being herself. My husband is a lot like her. Your telling her that being herself is misbehaving is indeed being a jerk. Your refusing to understand her personality is being a jerk. Be kind and understanding and I'll bet you can find some middle ground, as my husband and I have. But that will never happen if you continue to insist she be like other people and not like herself.", " This is exactly why I don\u2019t think Holiday parties should exist at all. Why the fuck would you want to socialize with people whose only connection to you is a work relationship. It is so phony and artificial and except for a few bored extroverts no one wants to go to them. I think they are basically ego boosts for C suite executives to survey and show off little fiefdoms and give fake praise to their good and loyal serfs. Instead of the CEO praising Bill in accounting for crushing his numbers for the 5th year in a row. Why don\u2019t you just hand Bill and envelope with $1,500 cash in it. That\u2019s the best way to reward employees for a job well done.", "Whoo. Thoughts and prayers, man.", "YTA for saying 'she can't behave' and it turns out she's a wallflower and not a raging drunk", "Give her a written quiz on what is and is not appropriate behaviour and dress for various events.  Then leave her at home regardless.", "I think you should except the fact that you love her. Or not. And either let her be herself, or move on. I think you are the ass hole.", "And everyone else. Can you imagine being another spouse who doesn\u2019t even work there and then you\u2019re seated next to her for dinner?", "This!! Like that\u2019s not being introverted, that\u2019s acting like a petulant child. Rude and immature and now she\u2019s pissed he won\u2019t take her. Leave at home. I\u2019m embarrassed in your behalf.", "Agree with this. I'm introverted and likely on the spectrum. I sometimes wear clothing that is less formal than it should be. Small talk/back-and-forth conversation is difficult for me so I avoid it or struggle. I have trouble doing new things and larger events are very stressful - noisy and unpredictable. It might come across as being inconsiderate but maybe she has an issue that is more complicated than introversion", "Side note- Autism ( especially in women) looks vastly different than what most people would think. It looks like what you described to be honest ( in part of course).", "I need a badge that says \"highly food motivated\". Will perform social niceties in return for buffet.", "YES!  I mean you can't argue about not mingling if a cat has staged a coup and clamied your lap.", "God that sounds awful, but good job being an adult about it lol", "Exactly!", "That\u2019s my thought too like, I get being bad at small talk with total strangers that really can be miserable, but if she has an out not to go she should be thrilled.", "She probably doesn\u2019t want him to go without her. She\u2019d be ecstatic if they both skipped the night entirely.", "Thanks! It was awful lol", "> And I cannot help but feel the \u201cglare\u201d comment borders on \u201cshe should smile more.\u201d Which, if you really want to see a woman\u2019s angry face, tell her that.\n\nI'm *so* fucking glad I'm not the only person that got this impression from this post. Everything about this guy and his co-workers attitudes just seems so uptight, bougie and outmoded.", "Never said I did those things. (; And good for you for seeking perfect wifey status. Not everyone wants to act like that because ya know, we\u2019re all different humans. Glad you got picked hunny.", ">I don\u2019t understand why people are acting like she is 10\n\nYes you do. The question you should be asking is why **she** is acting like she's 10.", "Maybe the reason this grown woman has gotten to the point where she throws a tantrum over pants and can't be trusted to be in public for an hour or two without being a complete embarrassment is because too many people have coddled her feelings. OP shouldn't have to treat his partner like a temperamental toddler who's 2 hours past her bedtime.", "My partner asked me to tell one of his ex-colleagues and her husband (I hadn\u2019t met them before) the story of how I ended up with him and also my life through medical school (which he wasn\u2019t there for). He\u2019s the extrovert and I\u2019m the introvert, but once I get talking I have a bad habit of getting too detailed and rambling. I was so nervous about not doing that, to the point where I deflected the question entirely by saying \u201cit\u2019s a really long story, and I don\u2019t want to monopolize the conversation.\u201d Fortunately all 3 wisely didn\u2019t ask again. \n\nThat said, I absolutely participated in the conversation and overall enjoyed dinner with them.
