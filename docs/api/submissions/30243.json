I wanted to share a recent experience with you. So, I (f16) recently made a hair appointment without my mother's knowledge or permission, I took care of all the arrangements myself, including paying for the deposit, the transportation to and from the salon, and even the actual service. I informed my mom about it the day after I made the booking, and she asked me how I planned to get there. I casually mentioned that I would take an Uber. Well, that didn't sit well with her, and she expressed her concern that \u201cI was too young\u201d for such a mode of transportation. She also called me inconsiderate and took the opportunity to lecture me. To add to the situation, my mother's boyfriend joined in and started yelling at me, claiming that I'm not grown up yet.\n\nHonestly, I'm a bit puzzled here. I took care of all the expenses, including the ride, and I'm not sure what the issue is. It's just a little confusing for me, that's all.

She's desperately trying to hold on to the younger you who she could make decisions for.  You're doing great, keep moving forward knowing that adults don't necessarily know what they're talking about.", "NTA\n\nThis is bizarre. You'll be a legal adult soon enough, and yet here she is trying to baby you. There's no rational reason for her reaction.", "NTA. I did similar when I was your age (but I had my own car and could drive myself - typical in my area, and Uber wasn\u2019t a thing back then). I told my mom, and although she didn\u2019t love that I was planning to cut my long hair much shorter, she realized that it was time I had control of my own hair, and wasn\u2019t mad. \n\nI can understand safety concerns about using Uber, but there are lots of ways to help mitigate safety risks with rideshare. Or if she\u2019s that concerned, she could offer to drive you. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I'm just curious did you make the appointment on your own on purpose? Like did you think your mom wouldn't let you get your hair done?

As a mom I would be proud of becoming more independent and taking the initiative to set everything up.

Ahem, middle daughter 'o mine...", "NTA you are quite capable and able to get your hair done without your mother.", "NTA\n\nA youth who can finally handle their sh*t themselves and not have their parents get involved. There is hope! \n\nAnyway I'm proud of you for handling all that. You'd be surprised at how many grown adults have to have their parents call their college to handle things.", "Nta. At16 you are not old enough ? You seemed to be able to make your own hair decision, pay for some of your needs and wants and decide how to bring them about.

A parent's job is to help their children grow into fully functioning adults. You seem to be well on your way!

You're living under her house which means until you are of the age to move out and get your own place, you follow her rules. As for being independent,  I get that you want to but you need to make smart decisions.  It is one thing if you arranged to go with a friend but UBER? Nope.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I say taking an uber/getting hair done alone at 16 is perfectly age appropriate. If you were *12* I might be concerned but definitely not at 16. NTA", "NTA. I get that the uber part may make her uncomfortable if you are going alone. I felt the same way when my daughter was your age. However, I don't understand the issue with the rest of it at all. I think it sounds very self-reliant to be making your own appointments and handling payments at 16. Do you have a shared family calendar? perhaps it would help if she has a heads up about your plans. That said, the boyfriend can fuck all the way off here. He has no reason to yell at you for anything.", "Why is mom's boyfriend getting involved. Dude needs to mind his own business.", "you're NTA but you should realize it's probably very scary for her to imagine her baby taking Ubers by herself now. It's not to say that you should stop yourself from doing so- but from her perspective its prob scary having you go in a \"strangers\" car. Sometimes Uber drivers can be creepy too so just keep that in mind.", "NTA. Look, I get it. My parents were both super over protective when I was a kid. My mom would have also doubted my decision to take an Uber (although that didn\u2019t exist when I was a kid). I don\u2019t think it\u2019s totally out of hand that she questioned the Uber choice, but then she better be willing to help by giving you a ride, rather than questioning your intent. \n\nSome unsolicited advice, with overprotective parents, be transparent with them where you can. She probably feels like you\u2019re trying to sneak around, even if that\u2019s not your intent. For something like this, once your mom gets upset, try to cut it. \u201cHey mom, if you\u2019re not comfortable with me taking an Uber, can I get a ride?\u201d If she says no, then you you stand your ground. If that doesn\u2019t work, then maybe your mom is more than over protective. In that case, I\u2019m sorry. \n\nAs for the boyfriend, he can butt out. He\u2019s not a parent, and it\u2019s an annoying thing when every adult feels like they can judge you for something you said / did, like they can infer your intention rather than just keeping the \u201cissue\u201d to what it is.", "Nta. Remember to get a style they\u2019ll hate. \ud83d\ude0e", "NTA. Well done you for being so independent. I agree with comments above saying that you shouldn't be paying for your own hygiene products etc. Some red flags here though, please please please do not let your mum have any access to your bank accounts.", "Tysm! It\u2019s very refreshing hearing for once I\u2019m not the problem.", "INFO: If she wants to hold onto younger you, why couldn't she offer to pay for your haircut? (Rhetorical, I know, but to me that falls under \"stuff parents should pay for)\n\nand NTA!", "Thank you. I truly felt like I was the issue  .", "I see! She said that on saturdays she sleeps in which I understand, hence why I offered to get an Uber.", "She just complains about everything. Everything turns into an argument, so I decided to just make things easier for her, by paying for everything, etc.", "It\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll use this as motivation to get my life together \ud83d\udc97", "I really like the your message. My mother makes me feel like I\u2019m 4! It\u2019s not that I want to be grown it\u2019s just I know I will be soon. I don\u2019t want to enter adulthood being confused and lost.", "Thank you. I understand.", "Maybe every woman should stay home then?\n\nWhat a ridiculous over reaction.", "Thank you! He often included himself because he\u2019s been with my mom for 3 years lol.", "I don\u2019t think you are, and I have kids your age. If your mom was worried about safety she could have said so without the drama.\n\nETA, NTA.", "Are you getting purple hair or some wild do that your mom would object to?", "Good question! I pay for most of my own thing; food, hygiene items and more, not that I want to but she will make me lol. The issues come about whenever I want to do something/want something that isn\u2019t a necessity. Such as getting my hair done or attending a party, she then will remind me of my age.", "I'm sorry that your mother has made things hard for you. In the future I would recommend sharing your Uber location with someone else (even a friend or the person you're heading to see) that can keep an eye out for you. Just for an extra bit of safety. I wish you all the best!", "So now you've learned that she complains no matter what. You can't please someone who is unpleasable, so please yourself in the future so at least one of you can be happy!", "Thank you :)", "I was getting my hair straightened:)", "Ah, so your Mom wants you to use your money when it benefits her.  Like food and necessities that she as a parent SHOULD PAY FOR HER CHILD.  And she doesn't want you to spend money that could go to her.  She sounds controlling.  Save your money in an account she can't access.  Study hard and do well in school, so that you can go to community college, college or trade school, and aim for a good job and a good future for yourself.  You got this!  NTA.", "Yes! She even has my location, shared for eternity lol.", "I'm super excited because my kid has starting organising their own extra lessons, even though I have to pay for them. LOL.", "Thank you! I plan on attending a trade next year. So excited \ud83d\udc97", "Yes, OP is going to have to continue to fight for her independence but it sounds like she's able to do it!", "Awww\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97", "Amazing!! Best of luck!\nI do think the Uber can be slightly risky for a solo teen, so perhaps you might have consulted when your Mom can drive you.  But it sounds like she might have thrown obstacles into you spending your money."]}
