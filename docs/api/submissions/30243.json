I did similar when I was your age (but I had my own car and could drive myself - typical in my area, and Uber wasn\u2019t a thing back then).

I say taking an uber/getting hair done alone at 16 is perfectly age appropriate. If you were *12* I might be concerned but definitely not at 16. NTA", "NTA. I get that the uber part may make her uncomfortable if you are going alone. I felt the same way when my daughter was your age. However, I don't understand the issue with the rest of it at all. I think it sounds very self-reliant to be making your own appointments and handling payments at 16. Do you have a shared family calendar? perhaps it would help if she has a heads up about your plans. That said, the boyfriend can fuck all the way off here. He has no reason to yell at you for anything.", "Why is mom's boyfriend getting involved. Dude needs to mind his own business.", "you're NTA but you should realize it's probably very scary for her to imagine her baby taking Ubers by herself now. It's not to say that you should stop yourself from doing so- but from her perspective its prob scary having you go in a \"strangers\" car. Sometimes Uber drivers can be creepy too so just keep that in mind.", "NTA. Look, I get it. My parents were both super over protective when I was a kid. My mom would have also doubted my decision to take an Uber (although that didn\u2019t exist when I was a kid). I don\u2019t think it\u2019s totally out of hand that she questioned the Uber choice, but then she better be willing to help by giving you a ride, rather than questioning your intent. \n\nSome unsolicited advice, with overprotective parents, be transparent with them where you can. She probably feels like you\u2019re trying to sneak around, even if that\u2019s not your intent. For something like this, once your mom gets upset, try to cut it. \u201cHey mom, if you\u2019re not comfortable with me taking an Uber, can I get a ride?\u201d If she says no, then you you stand your ground. If that doesn\u2019t work, then maybe your mom is more than over protective. In that case, I\u2019m sorry. \n\nAs for the boyfriend, he can butt out. He\u2019s not a parent, and it\u2019s an annoying thing when every adult feels like they can judge you for something you said / did, like they can infer your intention rather than just keeping the \u201cissue\u201d to what it is.", "Nta. Remember to get a style they\u2019ll hate. \ud83d\ude0e", "NTA. Well done you for being so independent. I agree with comments above saying that you shouldn't be paying for your own hygiene products etc. Some red flags here though, please please please do not let your mum have any access to your bank accounts.", "Tysm! It\u2019s very refreshing hearing for once I\u2019m not the problem.", "INFO: If she wants to hold onto younger you, why couldn't she offer to pay for your haircut? (Rhetorical, I know, but to me that falls under \"stuff parents should pay for)\n\nand NTA!", "Thank you. I truly felt like I was the issue  .", "I see! She said that on saturdays she sleeps in which I understand, hence why I offered to get an Uber.", "She just complains about everything.

My mother makes me feel like I\u2019m 4! It\u2019s not that I want to be grown it\u2019s just I know I will be soon. I don\u2019t want to enter adulthood being confused and lost.", "Thank you. I understand.", "Maybe every woman should stay home then?\n\nWhat a ridiculous over reaction.", "Thank you! He often included himself because he\u2019s been with my mom for 3 years lol.", "I don\u2019t think you are, and I have kids your age. If your mom was worried about safety she could have said so without the drama.\n\nETA, NTA.", "Are you getting purple hair or some wild do that your mom would object to?", "Good question! I pay for most of my own thing; food, hygiene items and more, not that I want to but she will make me lol. The issues come about whenever I want to do something/want something that isn\u2019t a necessity. Such as getting my hair done or attending a party, she then will remind me of my age.", "I'm sorry that your mother has made things hard for you. In the future I would recommend sharing your Uber location with someone else (even a friend or the person you're heading to see) that can keep an eye out for you. Just for an extra bit of safety. I wish you all the best!", "So now you've learned that she complains no matter what. You can't please someone who is unpleasable, so please yourself in the future so at least one of you can be happy!", "Thank you :)", "I was getting my hair straightened:)", "Ah, so your Mom wants you to use your money when it benefits her.  Like food and necessities that she as a parent SHOULD PAY FOR HER CHILD.  And she doesn't want you to spend money that could go to her.  She sounds controlling.  Save your money in an account she can't access.  Study hard and do well in school, so that you can go to community college, college or trade school, and aim for a good job and a good future for yourself.  You got this!  NTA.", "Yes! She even has my location, shared for eternity lol.", "I'm super excited because my kid has starting organising their own extra lessons, even though I have to pay for them. LOL.", "Thank you! I plan on attending a trade next year. So excited \ud83d\udc97", "Yes, OP is going to have to continue to fight for her independence but it sounds like she's able to do it!", "Awww\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97", "Amazing!! Best of luck!\nI do think the Uber can be slightly risky for a solo teen, so perhaps you might have consulted when your Mom can drive you.  But it sounds like she might have thrown obstacles into you spending your money.", "NTA. I have a 17-year-old daughter (she'll be 18 in a few months) and she's the type to make appointments or plans without telling me, then let me know the DAY OF that she needs a ride! Uber is an option here (I set up an UberTeen account that is paid for from my account, not hers), but she rarely uses it. I wish she could remain \"my baby\" forever, but I'm happy to see her branching out and gaining independence before she goes off to college next year. IMO mom's boyfriend needs to shut his mouth. He's not a parent so yelling about ANYTHING is inappropriate! Mom & random man she's sleeping with are the AHs here!", "NTA and it's none of your mom's boyfriend's business what you do with your free time. I was riding the subway in Philly as a 12 year old. Talk about being too young for that mode of transportation! But I was fine with it and so was everyone else. I think you sound like a really responsible young woman and I hope the hair appointment is an absolute delight.", "SHAME ON YOU", "Here\u2019s what you have to look at. Mom\u2019s first instinct is, \u201cNow I have to figure out how to get her to and from a salon.\u201d Because you made an appointment without considering her schedule. Depending on the city, she might not feel comfortable with you taking an Uber by yourself. You are 16. A million things could happen, and no good mother wants that for your child. Yes I get you were trying to be a big girl and handle the whole thing so your mom wouldn\u2019t have to do anything and that was your way of making it easier on her. But as a mom, I get her reaction. Boyfriend\u2026 needs to sit down. If they were engaged or married, or if he had just been a live in boyfriend forever and you called him dad, which you obviously don\u2019t, it would be different. Now if you had a friend and her mom taking you, that would be different. Or even a friend with a license. That would change things. Your NTA because you were trying to handle a hair appointment yourself, but you missed the mark a little bit. You need to convo with mom away from boyfriend and I\u2019m sure you can work it out.", "NTA But your mom\u2019s boyfriend needs to freaking chill", "Nta you're 16.  Safety could be an issue but if so, what would she prefer?", "NTA\n\nBut, my guess is your mom is having a knee jerk reaction about the safety of Uber drivers. (Which I get. One hears stories. They arent common, but... It's also a newer thing, and she may not know how to make sure you keep yourself safe.)\n\nTalk her through any safety concerns.\nAnd good on you for doing all the organizing!", "The reality is that you are not a legal adult. So you should have informed your mother before making this appointment because she is legally responsible for you. If something happens to you, it falls on her. Uber has only recently allowed teenagers under 18 to ride alone, so the concerns are fair.", "NTA it sounds like your mom is on a power trip looking for an excuse to yell at you.", "what are you, amish? Your parents suck.", "Get your drivers licence asap", "NTA. And her boyfriend was right, you\u2019re not full grown at 16 but unlike what he apparently assumes, you shouldn\u2019t be full grown yet. Completely normal. Since she seemed fine at first, I can\u2019t illuminate you on why it\u2019s such a problem either. That\u2019s a question she will have to answer!", "Your not but your parents should trust you and treat you like an adult I mean they're going to have to in two years anyway why not start now", "NTA- I would just speak to your mom privately and explain that you apologize for not informing her before handling this out but that you thought she'd be happy about showing your independence and responsibility. I can see her being worried about you, she's a mom after all. Until you're legally an adult she IS responsible for you and all your decisions however her boyfriend needs to stay out of it though so speak to her privately", "Nta, you were being very responsible", "Your mother's boyfriend had no right to talk to you at all about it, and the fact she let him tells me enough as it is. Cudos on you for taking the initiative and doing something for yourself. \n\nAlso, there's nothing inconsiderate about making an appointment and then forwarning your mother of your plans to go to said appointment in advance. If she had plans for the day you decided, maybe she should be considerate enough to understand you will be a legal adult in 2 years. \n\nIn 2 years she will legally not even have a right to your medical information or to schedule your medical appointments on your behalf. You need to be capable of making decisions, appointments, plans, etc for yourself. Frankly if you're old enough to drive (you are) and work (you must be to have money for your own care I imagine) you're old enough to take an Uber", "NTA. You're not an adult, but you'll be soon. That's something she can't change. I would've said something along the lines that \"she's scared because her daughter is growing up\" but that was out of the picture when her boyfriend was also lecturing you.", "So part of it is communication. You are 16 and it is definitely time you learn how to be independent. BUT, you are still a minor and your mother's daughter. I think really the issue lies in approach. I think what needs to happen is you need to express to your mom that you would like more independence. Don't yell, don't make it into a fight. It's hard not to get defensive with what your mom says to you but you really need to listen to what she is saying, not about how what she is saying is currently making you feel. Easier said than done, I know. But you need to be able to take in her point of view and then tell her your ideas on what she says. This way the two of you can come to a compromise. \n\nOverall, go to your mom and say hey, I'm 16, and I would like to exercise more independence. Can we find common ground on where we can start that will make both of us happy? I want to prove to you that I'm responsible and can handle some things on my own. And maybe the more I prove to you I'm responsible and trustworthy, I can earn your trust to do more things on my own.", "16 year olds are not grown up enough to make their own decisions. That\u2019s why you have to be 18 to make your own decisions. It\u2019s not some arbitrary age they chose. They made 18 the age because there is enough evidence of people under 18 making decisions that land them in danger or trouble.", "Awww Tysm! I\u2019ll let you know how things go :)", "Exactly. She doesn\u2019t want to take me herself yet has a problem when I provide a way of transportation..", "I would be so proud of my daughter if she did that! In all fairness, she could bike to the hairdresser, but still! NTA", "She\u2019s not full grown but she\u2019s supporting herself as far as food and necessities that isn\u2019t housing, so I would say she has the right to make her own decisions!", "Talk about arbitrary - there is no law about having to be 18 to make a decision, lol. I take it you don't have kids!", "Nope, you definitely aren't the one with the issue. I worry you'll have to deal with more of this.\n\nJust remember that no matter how right you are: *she* has the power until you're 18 as long as it doesn't qualify as some kind of abuse (in which case child protective is the place to go), and once you're 18 the extent of her power depends on the extent to which you can or cannot provide for yourself.\n\nI hope this is just passing and she realizes that you're gonna fly the nest one way or another. That's life.", "She's not a woman, she is still a child, a minor child.", "So you\u2019re not too young to provide for your own essentials but you\u2019re too young to decide what you want to do with your hair? Yeah this is control issues to a T. Moms having a hard time letting go, but also is trying to lighten her own load by justifying you being financially independent. It doesn\u2019t work that way. NTA.", "She legally doesn\u2019t have the right to make these particular decisions. She could leave the house and her mom can get the police to bring her back. We can argue all we want, the reality is that she legally can\u2019t just leave the house and do whatever she wants. Your belief that she has the right doesn\u2019t mean Jack.", "Just found the mom", "Her mom is legally supposed to require her to buy food or necessities either but she does. And an FYI, not all police will bring you back to your parents from 16 on. They can but often don\u2019t when you\u2019re safe. My oldest child left her adopted father\u2019s house at 16 because of abuse the sheriff\u2019s department was literally ignoring. She left the state all together. My ex demanded the cops transport her back. Both the county he lived in refused and the the state she ran to refused to transport her back. They did a well child check and let her be.", "Even if I was the mom, she still can\u2019t go out without permission. Y\u2019all are hilarious. Like it\u2019s really not about right or wrong. Just talking to a wall at this point.", "Okay cool story, still can\u2019t leave the house without your parent/guardian\u2019s permission. I\u2019m not defending the mom. I\u2019m just saying that it doesn\u2019t matter. The post is that she intended on going to a hair appointment by herself without asking permission, not that her adopted father is abusing her. lol like what", "Same concept about leaving. The cops sure as hell isn\u2019t bringing a 16 year old from a hair appointment if they won\u2019t bring them back across state lines. That\u2019s absurd thinking on your part.", "Omg lol okay, you win. Your stupid sob story wins"]}
