And your sister's family can't afford another one. \n\nYour BIL is a big AH for not considering consequences and getting such an expensive gift. But this is not the fault of your sister or your niece who is really sad. \n\nWould you consider to get one for your niece and have a serious talk about how big gifts should get?

Is there any chance sister/Callie saw it and didn\u2019t know/think it was Maddie\u2019s present?\n\nI\u2019m a little baffled that your sister had no idea at all about what Stephen had bought. And Callie is 5 so I get her being upset but it\u2019s not your responsibility to buy her a gift just because your daughter got a birthday present Callie wanted.\n\nAsking for a gift back is insane.

Stephen maybe a soft one but I don\u2019t think you are.\n\nNTA OP", "Gonna say NTA  \n\n\nThey gave the gift, thats all there is to it, now they want it back so your daughter got no gift from them then for her birthday they dont love or care for her only their own child.  \n\n\nThats the message being sent and be clear to them thats the message being sent.  \n\n\nIt seems like Stephen may have over spent on the gift without thinking and its causing issues and if thats the case fair play, but why should your child suffer as a result why cant you just buy Cassie one for her birthday and that way your child does not have her gift taken from her cruely.", "NTA. It was a gift. Stephen and Liv should have set a budget limit. They can also save to get one for Callie or Callie can come over and play. Giving it to Callie will only make her spoiled and learn she can cry to get what she wants.", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister left your BIL in charge of the gift. He got your daughter something he knew she would like. Your sister, however, *is* the AH because she's demanding you take a gift from a child. If she had stipulations for the gift, she should have laid them out before sending her husband to shop for it. You're right. It *is* absurd that she's asking for it back. Your parents telling you to give it back or buy the other child one is absurd, too. It was a birthday party!", "You're NTA but your sister is in a state right now where her husband kind of screwed her and their kid over, and I think you should consider what it's worth to show your sister that you have her back. If you truly can afford it, I'd suggest offering to buy Callie her own car as an early birthday/Christmas/whatever gift so the cousins can drive around together. Then in the future, set a price limit on gifts and ask that any presents above $$$ amount be discussed with you beforehand so that family members don't accidentally spend a lot on something that kid won't be interested in. That keeps it neutral and friendly and prevents future issues in a classy way.", "NTA, but in your shoes, if I could EASILY afford to buy another motorized car, I would do that and give it to Callie. Your BIL f'ed up here\u2014unthinkingly bought and gifted something that his own daughter wanted without checking with his wife. Your sister is TA for blaming you, but her little girl had nothing to do with the snafu, and it's hard on her. On the other hand, if I couldn't easily afford it, then I would let sis and BIL figure something out. I'm not  taking a gift back from my own four year old.", "NTA, but your sister and parents are. Why don't your parents buy it for her of they are so concerned.", "NTA\n\nWho is Maddie?", "Buy another one for your niece. Your sister could be more tactful but maybe her husband spent too much on the gift without discussing with her and if your financial situation allows, just buy one for your niece. Don't let your niece see your daughter have a gift from her own parents that she can't have because her parents can't afford it for her, that's just MEAN.", "NTA\n\nBut I personally would give it back and never ever in my life buy her or her kids anything. She would also be never invited to my house.", "NTA... first of it's rude to return a gift and secondly it is extremely rude for her to demand a gift her husband gave to your daughter just because her daughter wants it I mean they just need to teach their kid how gifting works but again seems like your sister also doesn't know how gifting works and again they need to teach the child that she just can't have everything she cries for or they are gonna have bigger issues than this in future", "Have people always been this entitled or are we just seeing it more now?

There is so much wrong here, first your sister presuming to know your finances, second thinking that her daughter wanting a gift was a valid reason to take a gift from her niece, and lastly asking for the gift back at all. Whatever decision you decide will be the right one. I feel bad for Stephen for sure.", "Info \u2014 why don\u2019t you just buy another car for Callie & give to her as a gift?", "NTA. That's some balls. It's also bad parenting. Why can't they tell Callie that when it's her birthday, she should ask for one? Does Callie get whatever she wants? \n\nTo keep the peace, I would let them know Callie can expect one for her birthday or the next gift-giving holiday.", "Nta unless he gave away her toy", "NTA. The audacity of some people is astounding.  How tacky do you have to be to ask for a gift back? Give them the gift back with a note saying, \"Thanks for the 'gift'.  Please, no more in the future\" and never accept another gift from them again.", "NTA. She is literally asking you to rip a gift that was given to your daughter AWAY from her to appease Callie.  Yeah hell no.\n\nShe's not only rude but incredibly selfish. A gift is a gift. And trying to demand it be taken away from a 4 year old? Oh she's the worst.", "NTA her problem is with her husband. Maybe you should point that out. Why would he buy his niece an expensive gift he can\u2019t afford for his own daughter? That kind of show off behaviour is fucked up. Poor Callie, she\u2019s just a baby and doesn\u2019t understand.\n\nIf money isn\u2019t an issue, maybe offer to buy your daughter whatever car she wants instead and give the gift back.

However, if they truly can't afford one and you can, why don't you tell your sister that you will buy your niece one for Christmas.", "NTA. you'd only have to give it back if they named the baby Cheelee", "Your sister can fuck off, and your parents have two choices: \n\n1) THEY buy Callie one for the next holiday/birthday if they feel she should have one.\n\n2) THEY can come explain to your four year old why they are taking her new gift away to give to her cousin.\n\nNTA. Was your entire family raised in a barn?!", "NAH.  \nBIL obviously spent the budget for their daughters birthday on your daughter, and to add insult to injury he spent the \u00a3 on the one thing his own daughter wanted! So tight on a 5yo.  \nCross words have obviously been had at home and her mum is devastated. BIL can\u2019t humble himself to say he\u2019s really sorry and he overspent, is there any chance the girls can share or Callie could have it, so mum has come in all guns blazing demanding it back.  \nI understand why mum is gutted and tried asking for it. I also think it\u2019s rude and inappropriate to try and ask for it \u2018back\u2019 from another child. BIL is the one who has serious making up to do, but if you really can afford it I\u2019d suggest getting this upset little girl a reciprocal value gift of a toy car next gifting occasion.

Whose maddie", "NTA I would give it back quietly and just not invite them next time.  Let your bil know why you're returning it.", "Lmao almost every child on earth wants the other kids birthday presents but only the worst parents would literally TAKE THEM BACK FROM THE BIRTHDAY GIRL to appease this.\n\nNTA\n\nOn one hand:\nImagine growing up and learning the lesson that on their birthdays, other people get gifts and you don't. \n\nOn the other hand:\nNow imagine growing up and learning whatever lesson it is that you learn when your uncle gives you a gift and a few days later your parents take it away to give it back to your aunt because your cousin wanted it.\n\nEdit: further thinking upon it I think it would be even MORE damaging to the non-birthday girl to teach her that she never has to watch something good happen too someone else without  it also happening to her", "NTA. You can\u2019t have a fa,ily member do that to your daughter. It would be a crappy leasing for both kids. A gift is given, end of story. Neither of the kids would benefit long term with that.", "Odd man out but ESH except for Maddie. If it's one of those ride on powered cars you said then that's easily a $150-200 present. That is not normal for a struggling family to gift another child. You know they couldn't afford that. Your kids are about the same age. You know that he has a history of giving you an unusual amount of attention and extravagant presents and yet you continue to accept them. You need to set some boundaries with your BIL and not just keep accepting expensive presents that you know are causing issues for them because it benefits you and your family. If you couldn't afford it yourself I'd say maybe ok you had a reason but you said flat out that you can easily afford it. \n\nYour sister's an AH for getting mad at you when the bigger portion of the blame goes to her husband and he's the biggest AH and is probably well on the road to being an ex. \n\nAlso final note on gifts and boundaries. Maddie's 5. When she's 16 would you be ok with uncle Stephen giving her very expensive gifts possibly without his wife or your knowledge or approval? Maybe it's innocent, but Liv has got to be wondering if something's going on between you and him and honestly down the road if something's going on between him and Maddie. At 5 Maddie needs to have an understanding of appropriate gifts too and family is not an exception to that. He wouldn't be the first uncle to gift lavish gifts to a niece and turns out to have bad intentions later.", "I'd return the damn car and send a message to your brother in law saying that as much as you REALLY appreciated the gesture he was sending, going forward you'd appreciate it more if he NEVER gets your child another gift. The scenario and how your sister handled it shows that anyone can and will be disrespected and treated as a second class citizen if their child wants something that is gifted to them. Taking back a gift given to a child puts that child through a lot of confusion and hurt and you don't want to ever put your daughter through those emotions ever again. And then GO LOW CONTACT with your sister till she apologizes.", "NTA? YTA? ESH? \n\nNot for the gift issue - for EVERYONE failing to recognize that your BIL is using you to hurt your niece and your sister. He gave your daughter a splashy gift his own child was yearning for, and that he'd told your sister was a \"waste of money.\" And then watched his 5 year old twist through an entire birthday party.\n\nYour family needs to figure out how to get you extracted from being his tool for abusing her.", "[removed]", "ah yeah the peace keeping enablers are present as soon as the insane ppl ask or insane things. NTA keep it. tell them, as an olive branch, callie gets one on her birthday or smth smth", "You guys In India? NTA", "NTA. They could afford to buy one for your kid, but not their own? Yeah, no. \n\n\nI see where the niece gets the idea it\u2019s ok to ask for other\u2019s personal property, even from a small child. The entitlement is unreal and shame on your parents for encouraging you to reinforce such childish and selfish behavior from your sister.", "NTA.   Your sister is enabling a sense of entitlement in her child by doing this.  She should help her 5yr old deal with the disappointment of seeing someone have something she wants but can't have.  Maybe encourage sharing when the cousins are together.", "ESH; the husband super f\u2019d up by buying that gift for your daughter, your sister should not have asked for it back, and if money is not an issue for you then you should just buy one for your niece.", "YTA \n\nYou should find out more. It sounds like Stephan grabbed her child\u2019s gift rather than the one intended for your child. \n\nAlternatively you could buy their child the same gift - if you won\u2019t do that then you should feel pretty bad about it.\n\n\nEdit: at minimum you need to stop accepting expensive gifts from your BIL. It\u2019s beyond inappropriate to continue now that you are a pattern.", "YTA. That is a 250 dollar gift for a four-year-old. Your sister should be absolutely LIVID at her husband for spending so much, and you should be understanding that it was a mistake given the cost.", "NTA. Brother in law probably was concerned that a gift he could actually afford would not be acceptable to bring to a party thrown by a family of your income level. Because he was left in charge of gift buying and was probably given no guidance by sister, he over-spent so as not to commit a faux pas at the rich people's party.  He sacrificed for you. You are NTA but you can see its really not fair to invite attendees of a much lower income level without going to the effort of reducing the pressure on them to bring a gift that would not stand out as deficient in a pile of rich people's gifts. You wouldn't have this problem now if you had specified ahead of time, for example, that everyone was chipping in on one big gift, or that only Barbies and Barbie accessories would be the gifts, etc.", "Good lord.

It may seem rude of her to ask, but it really sounds like he is essentially robbing his own family and she has to try something to stop the damage he keeps doing. It's heartbreaking that he keeps denying his own family like this - indeed I'd say its abusive to keep steamrolling his wife like this as he controls the finances, denies them things and overspend all without communicating to his wife.\n\nI suspect BIL is insecure because you guys are likely a larger income family then them - the expensive gift giving might be his attempt at appearing richer than they are to you guys and his version of \"keeping up with the jonses\".

(If her parents can't afford that toy for her but they bought it for her cousin, then BIL needs to do some explaining to his wife, first.)  \n\n\nBut if the toy is affordable, just because she saw another kid get it, doesn't mean she shouldn't have it: it just means she can't be allowed to think she can take another kid's  toy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They are still little sponges at that age and teaching her that if she whines she\u2019ll get what she wants is not a good idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you know Callie whined?

Teaching her that if someone tried to take something that was gifted for her would probably leave her as equally devastated?  \n\n\nShe's a 5 year old girl and these emotions are really big on them. And the father definitely shouldn't have bought something like that without consulting his wife first. But SIL demanding OP give up the gift is not the way. Rather she should be consoling her daughter and teaching her that while we don't always get what we want, there are still things to look forward to. When my brother got a scooter for Christmas in the 90's I pitched a biiiig fit and made the whole day uncomfortable for everyone. The next year I got a whole new bike. \n\nThe point is, SIL has a moment here where she can teach her daughter and help her sort through these emotions. But going to OP and demanding the gift be returned when their own daughter already is attached to it is just as crappy as what the dad did. Could OP give it? Yes. Would it be fair to her 4yo? No. Is it fair to the 5yo? No. Hurt feelings are going to play a part either way.

I have friends who are very wealthy and given them a sweater or a blanket for their birthday as a token of appreciation because they have everything, and they\u2019ve always accepted it with grace, as I do in kind. That\u2019s how I was brought up and Liv was brought up the same way.

Marriage should be a partnership where you divide tasks and responsibilities that you both decide are important. \n\nSome people do better a shopping or just enjoy it more.

That's just sick. If she can tell her daughter that on her birthday she can have one too, it's different.\n\nImagine if you've been asking your parents for a laptop for school and your parents say they can't afford and then your dad bought athe same laptop for you cousin on his/her bd. That's the equivalent to a 5 years old here, and it's super hurtful of the father to do this. \n\nOP owes her niece a bd gift anyway since her daughter got such an expensive bd gift, she should reciprocate.

You are still assuming a lot about the context here, like we can't know that the kid asked and was told this directly, but this obviously adds some info about the uncle's poor decision making.\n\nI still think it's a bad idea to get a kid something after they see someone else get it for their birthday because that kind of spoiled entitlement is something I keep seeing in adults in way too many reddit posts.\n\nAnd the aunt here should never have made this into op's problem.", "I think it looks like a problem that originated between Stephen and Liv due to money.
