Call and chat him up; it may lift his spirit.\n\nIt is crap folks gave you a hard time, as if they are life experts. Best to you OP.", "NTA, although you should tell them why.  If they don't understand then they TA.\n\nI lost my younger brother several years back, he was in his late 30's.  The hospital where he was in palliative care was just off a freeway.  For several years after his death, every time I drove down that freeway, as I approached that exit (infrequently, maybe only every few months), I would get heart palpitations and my eyes would well up.  It lessened over time, as grief usually does.  But it was very intense the first couple of times.\n\nI can't even imagine what it would have been like to step into the same room that he spent his last few weeks in.  Anyone who can't understand how difficult it would be for you to go through this is an asshole.", "NTA \n\nIm so sorry for your loss. My sister quit her job because my dad died in icu at the place she worked. I had a really rough time going near, started crying and all. But I guess the nurses just assumed it was because my baby was hospitalised and taken to a test. I swear when we turned at the corner and went past the room he died in my heart broke a little. \nIt can be traumatic. But you probably dont know how much until you lose a loved one.", "NTA, but there is nothing to be gained from being obtuse about the exact reason you are uncomfortable in that room.  \"This is the room I watched my father slowly fade away in\" is a lot different than \"this reminds me of my dad\".  If they've already been told the exact reason and they're still acting like this, yeah, they are assholes.  But in the post, there seemed to be a lot of polite covering up or lessening of the actual truth.

It's not trivial.", "NTA but I think your wife should explain it is the exact room your father was dying in and not just the general area.  I don't think you or she were wrong to keep it vague but they might back down and stop causing so much drama if they fully understood.  If not, then you are 100% justified shutting them down and even blocking them from contacting you until they back down.

Dad didn't die at the hospital. He was in that room until he went home on hospice and actually died at home.  Either way I can't help my feelings or the wave of emotions that hit me stepping back into that place.", "My mum died in the ICU when I was 8, and 25 years later I still haven't returned to that hospital.

After my dad passed, same scenario as yours unfortunately, I had a panic attack going into another hospital to visit a friend. It was unbelievably hard to try to hide that so I could be there for my friend, and it was a hospital on the other side of the state. I wouldn't have been able to go in either. I am glad you did what you had to do for your own wellbeing. What anyone besides your spouse thinks about it is irrelevant. They have no idea what it feels to lose a parent that way.", "Do you feel the same way when you walk into the house your father actually died in?", "In that case, they're the AHs.

I'm so sorry for your loss.", "Sharing emotions and feelings is hard for me, that's on me and I understand that much. They know that was the room dad was in after his unsuccessful surgery to remove his cancer. They also know I was very close to dad. I may be obtuse but simply saying a specific room holds too many memories of dad should be all they need to know.", "I truly understand how you feel. An uncle of mine ended up in the same ICU unit where my father had died a year earlier. He was in a serious enough condition that my sister and I knew it could well be the last time we\u2019d see him so we forced ourselves to go and visit. We thought we were strong enough. \nWe were wrong. \nMy aunt wanted to chat with us at the same waiting room where we had spent days and nights waiting for the doctors to update us and slept/napped in between looking in on our dad. After just about 20 minutes, we were both in tears and had to apologise to our aunt and explain why we were upset and that we had to leave. \nFortunately she understood. But my uncle did end up dying a short time later.\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to go back to that hospital and God forbid I\u2019d have any reason to.", "OP, I\u2019m a pediatric nurse. We had a kiddo that lived with us for two years because we couldn\u2019t find placement for him. He was our baby and we loved him. He fell ill and, likely due to his past medical history, went into cardiac arrest. We had to cpr him in the room before transferring him to the icu. Only recently (3 months later) I had another patient in that room and I cried after leaving the room. \n\nSo I cannot imagine what it would be like if it had been a parent, someone I had known my whole life, or someone who loved and cared for me. NTA", "NTA, the 2 hospice rooms my grandfather used in his last weeks alive, have been converted for visiting specialists to use. I can\u2019t stand being on that floor of the hospital, I have to use the elevators away from that area also. I have explained my predicament to the staff, so now I usually have the last appointment of the day and the doctor will use a different room for me. \n\nI know I sound spoilt and entitled, I honestly can\u2019t breathe being in that small area of the hospital.", "My father died at home from cancer--it wasn't unexpected.  But still, I have no idea how my mother could bear to go into that bedroom ever again.  If it were me, I'd have flashbacks and a breakdown."]}
