Theodore it is! So I've been making post about our baby boy on Instagram calling him \"Theo\" cause Theo and Teddy are some nicknames were going to use and were just so excited, he's our first! Well today, after posting these posts for at least a month now, my bil reached out to me, for the first time in my husband and I's 7+ year relationship. (He lives in another state, and calls my husband maybe once a year, and when my husband calls, he's usually dismissed so he's stopped trying)\n\nHe's upset because \"Theo\" was the name of their dog that passed in January, it was an older dog and he definitely loved her I'm not dismissing that and I understand how hard losing a pet can be, they're family I completely understand. But while I knew, I never made that connection. Theodore isn't Theo that's just a nickname for the name so that combined with the fact that we just...don't communicate much, along with the fact that this is a human and not a dog, the name being more or less the same never even occured to me. He was basically saying he feels it's rude and inconsiderate for us to name our baby Theodore despite the fact that he calls once a year and never visits, so he will more than likely not see this baby but at MOST once a year, another reason it didn't occur to either of us.\n\nHe sent me many paragraphs about how it was a hard loss for him so he's surprised we'd still choose Theodore \"considering all we've (him and his husband) been through\". I was very cordial about it and made it clear it wasn't our intention to hurt him and we just didn't consider how the names were the same yet he continued to insist it's rude because it was \"just such a tough loss for us\" I expressed I understand how he feels and if he needs support he can always reach out and I'm sorry he feels affected by our name choice emotionally and while it wasn't our intention, it clearly hurt him nonetheless. However he continued to insist it's \"a decision that lacks conscious awareness\" but also expressed \"I don't for a second think your choice had anything to do with me or my dog\" so I ended with a \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" because no matter how polite I tried to be he kept trying to kick this \"dilemma\" further down the line. I even made sure to let him know I'll call him Teddy on Instagram from now on so as to not upset him by him seeing the name Theo, I'm nauseous, getting kicked in the ribs by Teddy, and don't know how to feel.

You\u2019re fine, pay him no mind, and enjoy the name you want. NTA", "How would you even *know* that a low contact relative has a dead dog once  named  \u201cTheo\u201d?

Don\u2019t even worry about it. NTA and congratulations on your growing family.", "Absolutely, NTA. Your BIL, who at best, is low contact with your husband, has the nerve to call you to ask you to rethink your child's name because the common nickname was his dog's name. Screw him. He doesn't seem to figure much in yours and your husband's lives, what makes him think that he has any say in the life of your child? He doesn't.", " NTA people can\u2019t gatekeeper names full stop. Then the fact you are almost nc with him meant it didn\u2019t cross your mind and even if it did he doesn\u2019t own rights to the name. Imo people are getting more and more entitled these days, I think it has always been a thing but now everyone thinjs that they should be considered when decisions are being made. Errrm no, you live your life and we will live ours the way we want thanks.", "NTA. Everyone has some kind of association with names.

It doesn't sound like y'all are close enough for it to be reasonable for him to unload about you with this.", "NTA. You and your husband chose a name that both of you seem to like. After that, it's good to remember that you can't please all of the people, all of the time. And this is one of those times.", "NTA \n\nYour BIL is being an idiot and I'd just ignore him. Even if you had a better relationship with him I still think this would be an insane thing to complain about.", "Definitely NTA and he shouldn\u2019t be taking his grief out on you. He clearly doesn\u2019t own the name and is being ridiculous", "NTA. If he hardly ever talks to you, how are you suppose to know. Keep the baby name and don't worry about the BIL. He needs to work on his own feeling and you call your kid whatever you want.", "NTA. He has got to be kidding. And besides all that, taking the name of someone (or in this case the name of a pet) that has passed is usually seen as a sign of respect, as a way to remember and honor the loved one. A name doesn't belong to anyone, otherwise the world would either have ran out of names or had some really weird ones by now.  Nevermind the summation that brother hardly, if ever, will be within earshot of someone saying your son's name. What's brother going to do if he is at the grocery store or a restaurant and someone calls out to a Theo? Tacke them? Brother needs to grow up.", "NTA. Leave him a thumbs up emoji and that you can't wait for him to meet Theo", "NTA. Your BIL, on the other hand\u2014definitely TA. He calls you, the spouse of the brother who he barely speaks to, just to police you on the name of your baby? He seems awfully self-centred if he thinks you guys are naming your kid the same as his dog just to spite him. Also it's just very odd that he seemingly thinks this is all a valid reason to try to nudge you into changing the baby's name, considering he doesn't seem to be a very big or constant presence in your lives.", "NTA.  Clearly you are not naming your child after his dog, so no connection whatsoever.  Even if there was a connection, it is YOUR child and YOUR choice as to his name.  You've tried to reason with and reassure him.  That was nice of you, but unnecessary.  If I were you, I'd just move on as obviously he will only be happy if you relent and that is totally unreasonable.  BTW, congratulations!", "Info: why isn\u2019t BIL talking to husband about this?", "I'm already feeling a lot better about this thank you guys so much, I try to keep my ground and put my foot down but when you're only getting opinions from friends on this you never know if you're actually right, or they're just being on your side because they care about you, so seeing strangers read this and agree with me makes me feel so much better, I'm already feeling better from the stress this caused (which makes me worry about Theo, causing more stress \ud83d\ude2c) so thank you so everyone so much \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "NTA, it\u2019s your child, and there are many other Theo\u2019s and Theodore\u2019s in the world.

I truly think he\u2019s being unreasonable, given the circumstances. It\u2019s not like he lives with you or even anywhere near you, so it\u2019s not like he\u2019ll have it thrown in his face all the time.

If you were close and knew how troubled he was by the loss of the dog, maybe you would be TA, but you are not. He is being unreasonable.", "I laughed out loud at this one!", "I feel for your BIL, but NTA\n\nIt is bad enough when people have issues with names for any of thousands of reasons, and the loss of a dog is devastating (I have lost 2 and I was absolutely heartbroken.) However, I would NEVER presume to tell someone that they can't use a name for their child because of it. We are ALL responsible for our own grief and healing, and he should not be putting that on you. He needs to get over the loss on his own.\n\n\\*\\*I will say that I think it is a terrible idea to announce an unborn child's name on social media because that is exactly how the issues get started. If you had kept it to yourselves the baby would be born, named and there would be nothing he could do or say about it.", "The name of his\u2026 dog?  Is that a typo for \u201cthe name of his beloved six-year-old daughter\u201d? \n\nBecause then he would have some standing to ask family members to forbear from using that name for a few years. You still wouldn\u2019t have to honor his request, but he could ask. \n\nA pet, though? No, I\u2019d call the kid \u201cTheo My Uncle\u2019s Dead Dog\u201d and my BIL could just suck it. \n\nNTA", "NTA he needs to get a grip. What did he expect, when he gave his dog a human name?

If it is true, tell him while it is a ruff time for him he must be a good little boy and keep a tight leash of his expectations.", "What the hell. Someone barely in contact with your family thinks they can veto your child's name because of a dead dog. He has some serious entitlement issues. \n\nNTA. Good luck with the baby.
