{"id": 24269, "submission_id": "15mi3wv", "title": "AITA for not allowing my son to go on a trip with his mom's boyfriend?", "selftext": "Recently, my 13 year old son asked if he could miss one of our weekends together. He had been invited by his mom's boyfriend to go with him and his sons to Alaska for a week. \r  \n\r\n\nLegally I am entitled to custody of him every other weekend and he is my only child that still regularly attends these visits. My oldest two sons (21 & 19) rarely make the time to see me anymore and my two daughters (17 & 15) seem to be busy with their own things and recently I've only been seeing them every other month. My youngest child is the only one who is normally very happy to spend the weekend with me.\r  \n\r\n\nTheir mom and I separated in 2016 and in early 2021 she started dating her new partner. From my viewpoint, the kids seem to like him, and he also has four kids of his own (with three different woman). My youngest son particularly seems to enjoy spending time with him, and he likes to tell me some of the things they get up to together. I can admit I occasionally feel jealous with him bonding with another man so easily.\r  \n\r\n\nWhen my son brought up the trip to Alaska, he told me his mom had agreed to let him go as long as I also allowed it because the trip was scheduled for during one of my weekends. I told him no for several reasons.\r  \n\r\n\nFirstly, I do not know the boyfriend all that well and don't feel comfortable leaving my son in his company. You may argue that my ex does know him well, but I can't say I 100% trust her judgement in men. I have heard some unsavoury things from mutual friends about her boyfriend.\r  \n\r\n\nSecondly, from what I understand some parts of trip could be dangerous and too physically exhausting for my son who isn't used to some of the activities. They will be hiking, survival camping, white water rafting, and hiking glaciers. This all sounds fun sure but also dangerous. I worry about him being in situations he could potential be badly hurt especially as neither parent will be with him.\r  \n\r\n\nFinally, I hate to say it, but I am legally entitled to this weekend, and he needs to learn he can't just bail on things he's committed to because something better came up. If I don't see him that weekend, it will be a whole month before I get to see him again because I doubt his mom will let me rearrange to the next weekend.\r  \n\r\n\nHe was upset but seemed to understand where I was coming from. He sulked for the rest of the day before he went home. His mom texted me asking if I was serious about my decision and assured her I was and listed out my reasons for why. She told me I would regret my choice and that I was being an ass to our son. My mom also thinks I might end up regretting this decision, however, I'm confident that he'll quickly get over it. I'm going to make sure my son and I have a great time that weekend and I'm sure there will be other trips he can go on with the boyfriend in the future with his mom present or when he's older. \r", "created_utc": 1691594023, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mi3wv/aita_for_not_allowing_my_son_to_go_on_a_trip_with/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You seem to want to hold onto him because he's your last child who's still somewhat attached to you. \n\n\"Your weekend\" is a legal construct that he didn't choose (I'm assuming it's in your custody agreement with the court), so I'm not sure why you think he would be bailing on a commitment to you. The commitment is between you and your ex. If this is a special occasion and his mom really wants him to go, talk to her about arranging a substitute weekend.\n\nThis sounds like an amazing unique experience for your son. If you're really worried about his ability to do these activities, you can work with him to start hiking and building up his endurance. And if you're REALLY worried about the boyfriend and whether he's a good guy, why not get together with him and your ex and talk it out?\n\nYou seem quite ready to kill this trip rather than find ways to make it happen. Your son will likely \"get over it\" but that doesn't mean he's not hurt.", "YTA\n\n> I am legally entitled to this weekend, and he needs to learn he can't just bail on things he's committed to because something better came up.\n\nYou're making it sound like he had a choice in how he's shared between his parents. This isn't like \"Oh, he signed up to basketball, and has to finish the season\", which he had a choice in. So, while you're legally entitled to do it, it doesn't mean you're not an AH.\n\nLet's be honest, your other kids aren't spending time with you when they're not legally mandated to, and stuff like this is just ensuring that your 13 yo will do the same when he isn't compelled to see you.", "Info\n\n1. You see your child like twice a month on weekends\u2026 so he is with the mom and bf the majority of times? i assume they may live together \n\n2. So you have 4 other kids who dont bother to want to see you , why is that??? Your son may remember this and well never forget it\n\n3 listen he is with his mother the MAJORITY OF TIMES\u2026 you dont think she wouldnt approve of this if she didnt trust her bf???

Have you even considered that your ex and her boyfriend might have offered you a \"replacement weekend\" to compensate for the fact that you're not seeing your son.  You are TA for being jealous, a fact that you admit.   \nHave you considered that it might be your own attitude that is driving your children away?     \n   \nAlso, saying \"he can't just bail on things he's committed to because something better came up\": unless you and ex talked to the son and asked when he wanted to visit you, he never \"committed\" to anything.   \n  \nYou say that, \" I worry about him being in situations... as neither parent will be with him.\"  I assume that you mean yourself and your ex.  You have to accept that your ex's boyfriend (in a relationship with her for two years, and a person that your son \"seems to enjoy spending time with\") is one of your son's parents.   \n   \nYour mother and your ex are right.  You will regret your decision when your son chooses to no longer spend any time with you as soon as he is not legally obligated to do so.", "YTA\n\nYou've prevented your son from having a really cool trip to Alaska because of petty jealousy. Why wouldn't his mom let you swap for the following weekend? That seems like a reasonable deal - he can go on the trip with mom's boyfriend, but you see him the following week.\n\nYou don't see your older kids much, and I think this post has given us a clue as to why they don't want to spend time with you much.", "YTA. \n\nIt is one weekend. He is being given an incredible opportunity. In Fucking ALASKA! Have you been there? It's amazing! An opportunity to make some incredible memories.

Do you have any idea how unsure of yourself you were? \n\nYou are forcing him to not miss his weekend with you out of jealousy and pettiness. He will chose, just like your other children to eventually miss every weekend with you because you can't celebrate his joys and adventures with him. You can't let him grow and be an autonomous individual. \n\nYou are placing your comfort above his. Without a doubt. \n\nThis will bite you in the ass. I promise you. \n\nJust ask your other kids why they don't come around. \n\nI bet you they tell you that you are an asshole.", "YTA. What it really boils down to is that your are jealous.

He had no say in that and it probably puts dents in his plans with friends etc a lot.\n\nYou're holding him back because you're being jealous and selfish and trying to justify it. It sounds like an amazing trip, is probably not as dangerous as you think (I've done all those things with zero experience, you can do it as a tourist activity quite safely). If I was him I'd be furious.\n\nAre you meant to have him that weekend? Yeah. Did he chose for his parents to divorce and get new partners? No. Is the new partner trying to involve him and offering him a great trip? Yes. Are you being childish and selfish? Hell yes.\n\nSwap a future weekend with your wife to even the time and let him go. \n\nOh, and it's not his problem if your other kids don't see you anymore either.

He didn't commit to anything, its court ordered visitation. Did you even  talk to the ex about swapping weekends? If you are this stubborn I can see why your  older kids make other plans. Keep it up and you can lose this one too.", "YTA, why not just switch weekends or at least tell your ex that you will let him go if she will switch. You\u2019d still get your time and your son would still get a once in a lifetime experience. I\u2019m a divorce attorney and see this bullshit all the time. This is about sticking it to your ex, not helping your son. Keeping your son from these activities without a real reason will however help put him on the trajectory for him also not to see you when he is old enough to make those decisions", "YTA. \n\nFirst, kids deserve to have full social lives, not subject to the arbitrary time constraints of their divorced parents. Your kid will be invited to sleepovers, school stuff, etc that interferes with \"your time\" and any good parent puts what their child needs and wants over what the court has designated as \"their time.\" Your kids suffer when you limit their social life because of the custody agreement. \n\nSecond, this is a special opportunity for your son. Is it really unsafe? Is this guy really suspect? Ask yourself honestly, if a Dad of one of your son's friends came to you and asked to take your son on this trip, what would you say? You know the Dad socially, you know he has kids so he can parent generally, but you don't know him super well, yes travel has dangers. But my guess is you would likely say yes, because it is an awesome opportunity for your son that he wants to go on. \n\nAnd finally, most of your concerns could have been addressed if you had a conversation with your ex. She could have given up another weekend, and there's no reason to assume she wouldn't. You could have asked both her and her boyfriend about safety and all the details of the trip, and set limits on what they could do, asked for check ins, whatever. Instead you just assumed the worst so you had an excuse to say no. BE A PARENT. \n\nAnd for the record, your son will remember this. There's a reason your other children are distant with you, and your behavior here certainly indicates some of those reasons.", "> I can't say I 100% trust her judgement in men.\n\nWay to tell on yourself lol, assuming you\u2019re a man\n\nYTA let him enjoy the trip.

Additionally, your son didn't commit to this it was imposed on him.\n4. How often the other kids see you isn't your son's problem, they're not possessions. It's also a red flag that no other kid wants to see you - why might that be?", "YTA, there is probably a reason your older kids don't visit you...\n\nYou do have some valid points about the danger level of the trip as well as not knowing the boyfriend very well. I doubt any parent would trust someone they don't really know to take their kids on a potentially dangerous trip, especially when there is going to be multiple kids. This alone is enough to say no.\n\nThat being said, your entitlement is off the charts, \n\n>he needs to learn he can't just bail on things he's committed to because something better came up.\n\nHe didn't commit to anything, the commitment is between you and his mother, and it's not like he's bailing last minute...

Just switch weekends, you fucking selfish child.", "YTA and they're right about you regretting this decision. Your older kids don't want to spend time with you and you are choosing to push away the only one that does. Sit down with your ex and her boyfriend to discuss the trip further and allow your son to go on the trip. To feel better about it ask to set some perimeters about what you think he should and shouldn't be doing, and let your ex know that if your son goes on the trip he will have a makeup weekend with you.", "YTA.  Enjoy the time you have with your son because he will quickly become like your other children and quit coming around too.", "I feel like there are a lot of missing reasons for why the rest of your kids do not spend time with you. \n\nListen. Some of your arguments are valid, and I would need extra reassurance that the trip would be safe for a 13 year old as well. But nobody is stopping you from having a conversation with the boyfriend. This is an exciting trip, and he's 13 years old! Don't make him not want to come around either. Weekends can be rescheduled upon mutual agreement. I think YTA for not recognizing that there were better ways to still keep seeing your (decidedly happier) kid. This may seriously damage your relationship going forward.", "YTA\nIf you think your ex wouldn't swap weekends over a cool trip, you could have made her the AH by saying: it's fine if your mother agrees to have us be together next weekend. If she would have said no, then the blame would lie with her.\n\nYou could also have been less of an AH if you made the reason for not allowing him to go, be about your concerns for his safety instead of about it being your weekend.", "YTA.  And as wrong as a human being can be\u2026Kid ain\u2019t getting over anything but you", "YTA \nI hope you change your mind about letting him go before it\u2019s too late.

Look, I get it. I can see your hesitation, and the time your son has known this guy should be factored in. It's far away and a lot can happen. If he's known them for a couple years- I think you should let him go. \n\nBased on things you said and even your relationship with your other kids and the phrases you used- you are using the danger part of it to justify saying no. You are jealous, and your son is going to miss out on an amazing trip because of it. And he will resent you for it. I am a step mom myself, and their biomom would always pull stuff like this. Tell us yes then say no and make us the bad guys for still following through on the trips. The kids would become jealous and blame us for all of it.\n\nI know how hard it is to not have a lot of control or say so when it comes to your kids' lives- but it is what it is. Don't let him miss out on this awesome opportunity because you are jealous and hurt. Which I get- I really do- but you have to take a step back from this. \n\nAll of this is moot if she's only known the boyfriend for a short period of time- like 6 months or less, then you'd be right. But otherwise...\n\nYou have what, 5 kids? I think you need to do some serious self-reflecting on why your relationships with them aren't close and work to change it before you lose the last child you have left. I know there can be parental alienation and lifestyle issues from child support, etc. My husband and I went through all of it, and sometimes the dad just gets screwed. But you need to try to figure out why, and if it is a result of your actions or attitudes, and work to change it and improve- whatever it takes. My SK's would go through periods where they wanted nothing to do with us, so I get it. I really do. Sometimes you can't control it. But based on the way you talked, you might have a little to do with it. \n\nTalk to your son, talk to your wife and her boyfriend. Ask for details about the trip. Ask what he would do in certain situations, if he has experience doing this stuff. If he knows what he's doing- let your son go. Good luck. I hope your relationship with your kids improves.

He had been invited by his mom's boyfriend to go with him and his sons to Alaska for a week. \r  \n\r\n\nLegally I am entitled to custody of him every other weekend and he is my only child that still regularly attends these visits. My oldest two sons (21 & 19) rarely make the time to see me anymore and my two daughters (17 & 15) seem to be busy with their own things and recently I've only been seeing them every other month. My youngest child is the only one who is normally very happy to spend the weekend with me.\r  \n\r\n\nTheir mom and I separated in 2016 and in early 2021 she started dating her new partner. From my viewpoint, the kids seem to like him, and he also has four kids of his own (with three different woman). My youngest son particularly seems to enjoy spending time with him, and he likes to tell me some of the things they get up to together. I can admit I occasionally feel jealous with him bonding with another man so easily.\r  \n\r\n\nWhen my son brought up the trip to Alaska, he told me his mom had agreed to let him go as long as I also allowed it because the trip was scheduled for during one of my weekends. I told him no for several reasons.\r  \n\r\n\nFirstly, I do not know the boyfriend all that well and don't feel comfortable leaving my son in his company. You may argue that my ex does know him well, but I can't say I 100% trust her judgement in men. I have heard some unsavoury things from mutual friends about her boyfriend.\r  \n\r\n\nSecondly, from what I understand some parts of trip could be dangerous and too physically exhausting for my son who isn't used to some of the activities. They will be hiking, survival camping, white water rafting, and hiking glaciers. This all sounds fun sure but also dangerous. I worry about him being in situations he could potential be badly hurt especially as neither parent will be with him.\r  \n\r\n\nFinally, I hate to say it, but I am legally entitled to this weekend, and he needs to learn he can't just bail on things he's committed to because something better came up. If I don't see him that weekend, it will be a whole month before I get to see him again because I doubt his mom will let me rearrange to the next weekend.\r  \n\r\n\nHe was upset but seemed to understand where I was coming from. He sulked for the rest of the day before he went home. His mom texted me asking if I was serious about my decision and assured her I was and listed out my reasons for why. She told me I would regret my choice and that I was being an ass to our son. My mom also thinks I might end up regretting this decision, however, I'm confident that he'll quickly get over it. I'm going to make sure my son and I have a great time that weekend and I'm sure there will be other trips he can go on with the boyfriend in the future with his mom present or when he's older. \r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "It\u2019s pretty normal for teenagers to start having their own chosen activities on weekends so I\u2019m not necessarily suspicious that the older kids are moving on in life. And I kind of understand the worries about risks during physically demanding activities that the boy isn\u2019t used to. Any chance of sitting down with boyfriend for some reassurance about supervision, training, whatever might put your mind at ease about the trip? Is a recreational company running the trip, such that your could check with them about safety practices?\n\nPlease let go of \u201cbut it\u2019s MY weekend!\u201d  You can easily trade weekends with his mom. And it\u2019s best for your relationship if you support your kids as they grow up and want to expand their life experiences.", "Let the kid go but only way is you get the next 4 weekends in a row with your son. Your EX will get pressure from the kid to give you the 4 weekends. It will be a trip he won't forget. YWBTA if you don't offer the deal to the EX. Everything in life is negotiable.", ">My oldest two sons (21 & 19) rarely make the time to see me anymore\n\nGee, I wonder why\n\nYTA", "YTA for making your son to miss an awesome sounding adventure just because you are petty. Your other children do not have much time for you and you are trying to force your son to be with you.", "YTA\n\nWonder why your other kids don't want fuck all to do with you. Save this post and refer back to it when your youngest finally sees you for the manipulative assbag you are", "INFO: how long has mom & bf been dating? Could they change the trip to a different weekend when he\u2019s not with you? Did you suggest to mom that you switch weekends?", "YTA. You say you \"doubt\" his mother would be willing to rearrange weekends. Have you actually spoken to her about it? Maybe if you used your words and told her one of the main reasons you don't want your son to go is because you hate missing weekends with him, she would be willing to switch - for your son's sake, if not for yours.\n\nAnd for the record, your son never \"committed\" to spending ANY time with you. You get to see him every other weekend because your custody agreement says so. If you keep behaving the way you have in this situation, don't be surprised if your son follows his sisters' example and doesn't have time for you. Look in the mirror and ask yourself why your other children don't want to spend time with you. Trust me, it's NOT because they're busy with other things.", "It\u2019s a trip of a lifetime and you\u2019re keeping him from going because you\u2019re jealous. YTA.", "YTA. Your son asked you a favor and you said no. He would be missing one visitation for the chance to go somewhere new and cool. To bond with his potential new family. \n\nAlso your excuse sounds so dumb.\" I don't trust my wife's taste in men\"? You realize you ARE your wife's taste in men, right? At this point I don't trust her taste either.", "YTA. Have fun that weekend with the sulking kid.", "YTA big time.  It couldn\u2019t be more obviously that you\u2019re jealous that the ex\u2019s boyfriend is providing him an opportunity that you can\u2019t or won\u2019t, but make no mistake: refusing him the ability to go on the trip has damaged your relationship permanently.", "YTA and if you do this I have a feeling that as soon as he is 15 and can choose whether he wants to see you like your older kids you won't be seeing him anymore", "NTA.  Your role as a father is to protect your child to the best of your ability.  Period.  \n\n Just because your wife dates the guy doesn't mean he is a reliable enough person to entrust your kid to.   They've been an item less than 2 \n\n  The bf could be perfectly fine and safe but if you don't know him like that, you're well within your rights to say \"no\".  \n\n Don't let some redditors shame you for saying no. \n\nWe aren't your son's father.  You are.\n\nJust make sure that you actually do something fun with your kid during that time.   You may not be able to do \"Alaska\" but spend quality time with him and let him know that you enjoy all the time you have with him.\n\nLastly, I don't agree with what your ex did.  They should've had a sit down conversation with you prior in order to discuss all the trip details.  In this meeting you could've asked questions, voiced concerns, and rejected/approved outright.  If an agreement was made, then the 3 of you would notify and involve your son.\n\nThey effectively put you in a bad position of having to say \"yes\" to your son spending a bonding trip with a stranger or you saying \"no\" to a trip they already made your son excited about.   It's a low key shady move.", "YTA Congratulations in making him the 5th of your kids who won\u2019t bother with you. Imagine someone loving your kid and making the effort to include him for you to ruin it for him. Vile behaviour.", "NTA. \n\nI mean, you're a bit the asshole for your last reason.\n\nBut it's super fucked up of your ex to tell your son what she did. It makes you out to be the bad guy just for wanting to spend time with your son.", "Op is worried his kids don't want to see him as much and wants to do things with Mom's boyfriend. People like to DO things together and I don't hear much doing with Dad. Not all activities cost money. What does your kid like to do and what are his interests?

It'll do you all good.", "YTA because of this\n\n>My oldest two sons (21 & 19) rarely make the time to see me anymore and my two daughters (17 & 15) seem to be busy with their own things and recently I've only been seeing them every other month\n\nClearly you messed up somehow that your 4 older kids barely make time to see you, and you're on your way to doing that to your 5th", "Yta. No, he did not commit to his parents splitting. The fact that he has to spend time between you guys is because you guys split, and don't ever blame it on your kid again. You are going to come to regret this, he's not going to forget it for atleast a handful of years. He'll think about the chance he missed to see a new area and how you just wanted to puff out your chest and say that this is your weekend my son doesn't get to travel when he should be staying home with me.\n\nAsk for details on each activity. Confirm that they have professional people running these activities, but your son isn't going to forget missing a trip like this.

Trust me, he's not going to forget it.", "YTA (probably) \n\nyou are jealous - get over it.\n\ndon\u2019t know the man - so go meet him and form a better opinion and ask how you ger kids skills and safety will be catered to\n\nkid maybe can\u2019t do some stuff - help prepare him and assess his skills and abilities to keep up - if convinced this is a problem then and only then are you in the right.\n\nit\u2019s your weekend and the kid can\u2019t be allowed to bail (not on his commitments but in the courts allocation of time)   - be a grown up and swap with your ex.   \n\n\nyou have two low contact kids and unless you work out how to co-operate and place the kids welfare AND happiness a bit higher on the list of concerns you will have three.   \n\n\nyour instinct to arrange to have a good bonding time with your kid is a good one - but why have you waited till a stranger made it clear he wanted to do those thing?", "YTA. Why not sit down with the boyfriend and talk about your concerns, get an itinerary, and research the risks? Sounds like this guy might be in your kids life for some time. Sure, there are some red flags with having multiple baby mamas... but maybe you should make your own judgements about people rather than listening to the opinion of mutual friends. \n\nDon't force your son to spend time with you just because your other kids are wrapped up in their own young adult lives. That's not fair to him.", "Yta your son didn't commit to these weekends you and your ex decided them. \n\nYou will contact with this child too.", "If you don\u2019t trust the boyfriend then nuff said. Follow your instincts. Not the asshole.", "Yta", "YTA, when your son breaks contact with you (you know, like the rest of your kids did), are you going ro tell everyone that you don't know why and that you've done nothing wrong? Let him have his trip and have a different weekend with him or risk losing him forever, your choice", "YTA A lot of your reasons do not even make sense. You don't trust your son in his company? He's been with your son's mother, who he lives with, for two years. Do you think they haven't already been spending a substantial amount of time together? Why would being in Alaska somehow make it different? \n\nHow is your son \"bailing\" on you when it's something planned way ahead of time by a legal agreement he did not even have a say in? In the beginning of your post, you say he is the only child, out of several, who regularly attends scheduled visits anyways, so why is he the only one who needs a lesson on \"bailing\"?\n\nYou mention some reasons that could be valid at the end of your post, but I find it hard to believe those are actually your concerns after everything else.\n\nAlso, why on Earth does it matter how many women he has children with? In what way was that relevant to your post?", "YTA, wouldn't trust her judgment on men only because she was with you. Don't be surprised when your son decides to want nothing to do with you either.", "YTA. You have 5 kids and the only reason you see one of them is because of a court order that forces him. You should think really hard on why 4 of your kids want so little to do with you and if you're pushing number 5 that way.", "YTA how do you know your kid can\u2019t participate in these activities?  Are they things you wouldn\u2019t do.  I know I couldn\u2019t do them but I would let my kid try since we are different people with different abilities.\n\nYes it\u2019s your weekend but since the ex is aware of the trip to ALASKA for a week (2 weekends) you can suck it up she\u2019s missing out on her weekend too.  If it\u2019s that big of an issue mention it to the ex if tut could have an additional weekend?  Since she has custody it shouldn\u2019t be a problem if it is then you can decide if this adventure for kid is worth him missing you\u2019re weekend?  \n\nOP I would also reflect on why all the older kids have basically cut contact.  Since this is your youngest you need to look at if your behavior is a pattern.  Your kid will always remember missing this trip.  Your just jealous that he\u2019s bonding with the BF while you do everything in your power to stop it.  I hope OP realizes his child is at an age where he can request his visitations be changed, stopped, or on the kids terms.  He\u2019s not your property he\u2019s a person.", "So you don't trust your ex's taste and judgement in men. That's a bit of an own goal considering she dated you for a while. \n\nYTA", "I found the line about his ex's taste in men to be particularly amusing. that's a self burn if ever there was one.", ">But not a surprising look for a dad with kids who don\u2019t want to see him.\n\nThat was my thought exactly. No wonder none of the kids want anything to do with him. If OP proceeds with his plan and doesn't let the kid go, you can be damn sure the kid will remember and it will be one of the reasons that he also wants nothing to do with his dad once he's older.", "\u201cI\u2019m entitled to my child\u201d nah mate, you don\u2019t own a child and they are allowed to be their own person. Infact you should want them to think outside the box and follow their own path.", "Yeah, I was somewhat with OP until I got to his \"Finally\" paragraph. And the whole \"mom won't allow me to swap weekends\" excuse was fairly lame, especially since OP only \"doubts\" that she would. That question is easily remedied. It's also easy to say that you will only let the stepdad have that weekend if you can have another one.\n\nAs for not trusting the boyfriend, OP, that is on you to remedy. Whether your son goes on this trip or not, he is spending a lot of time with mom's boyfriend. You shouldn't only be concerned about your son's welfare on your weekends. You have heard some \"unsavory things\" but don't actually give a damn unless it's inconvenient to you?!? That kid spends more time with him than with you!\n\nAll you're left with is concern of the dangers of the trip and activities. They are valid concerns, but I'm not sure how much weight they should actually have.", "Right? And why is OP holding his son to a higher standard than his daughters?", "Why not just try to negotiate with the ex? He could just call her up and say \u201chey I\u2019m ok with him going, but only if I get the next weekend with him\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable for OP to want to keep his custody time. But there\u2019s no reason for his son to miss out because both parents are too stubborn to negotiate. I don\u2019t see why they can\u2019t just switch weekends.", "1. Her and the boyfriend don't live together.\n2. My older kids have things they would rather be doing and friends they would rather be seeing. Although I admit my older boys in particular have always favored their mom to me.

Men often spout this off though when things don't go their way.", "You know *why* courts \"favour\" morhers?  Because more often than not mothers fight for the custody that fathers don't want in the first place.  When men actually ask for custody they're more likely to receive it.", "No the courts favor the stable parent. I get you have your whole \"court's think dad's are bad thing\" but as as former family law attorney there was two cases ever that the court went with the mom over the dad when there was good reason not to and one of those had to do with the race of the children.

A parent won't be present. Will his presence magically stop any impending calamities?", "Even in my super conservative, \"anti-woke\" state the presumption is 50/50 unless one parent has shown they are a danger to the child or just didn't fight.
