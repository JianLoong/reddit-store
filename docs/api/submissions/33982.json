The place was a popular and somewhat high end restaurant. The unspoken agreement between the two of us was that I cover the bills whenever we go out together as I\u2019m doing much better financially.\n\nFor background information, Laura married right after college and became a SAHM. She only started working again last year after her divorce (no monthly alimony but ex husband takes care of all their children\u2019s expenses; she has almost 6 figure USD from their joint bank account that is now hers) and now more or less has the salary of someone newly graduated from college.\n\nSo we ordered five dishes to share at the restaurant. The dishes came one by one and Laura and I chatted as we ate. The last one was supposed to be a steak of a certain cut of beef and specific side dishes. What was served looked nothing like what was on the menu. I called for a server to take it back and get us the right order but my sister stopped me.\n\nLaura said the restaurant was super busy and we shouldn\u2019t add burden to the already busy and hard working staff. She said we could just eat this dish we got by accident. She said some places the owners make the staff pay for this type of errors out of their own pocket and we should be kind.\n\nWhen the bill came, I told my sister she needed to pay for the dish we didn\u2019t order. Laura threw a fit, telling me I knew she didn\u2019t plan to spend this kind of money today as I have always paid. I said I told her to return the dish and she refused so paying for it was now her responsibility.\n\nLaura finally scraped together enough cash for the dish while I paid for the rest, my sister calling me AH for being so petty. Later my mom also called me and said I was being unkind because I could easily afford to pay while Laura would find it harder to make up the loss.

I would be wondering if the wrong dish was the same price or not as well. Might have cost less. But you were correct to want to receive what you ordered. The server needed to know. And it might have been comped if you agreed to keep it. You did what you needed to assure your sister doesn\u2019t overstep again. You also should have just let her not like it and just do what you wanted. You were going to be paying, not her so what she wanted was even a point. Place too busy. Not your problem.

The time to bring up that she would have to pay is when you were discussing whether to send it back. Presumably you gave in then, so to later spring on her that she has to pay was just petty.", "ESH -- And you know what?  Why is a 40 year old grown woman calling their mommy to complain about their 32 year old sister over a restaurant dish?  I see this in AITA so often, so many busy bodies and tattle tales.

And then the whole family is in an uproar!  Who ARE these people, cuz I know no one like this.  Do any of you?  I'm starting to think that this whole sub is just full of rage bait and made up shit.

You because how you behaved was assholeish, not because you have the most money or are always obligated to pay. Your sis because it's real easy to spend other people's money, and when you/your spouse isn't the one paying, you don't make extra decisions that will affect the bill, counter to the wishes of the person who is paying the bill.

The place was a popular and somewhat high end restaurant. The unspoken agreement between the two of us was that I cover the bills whenever we go out together as I\u2019m doing much better financially.\n\nFor background information, Laura married right after college and became a SAHM.

She is the AH for this. And I don't know where you are from, but staff paying for a mistake from their own pocket ? Never heard of that (again, that might be thing elsewhere, I don't know).\n\nYou agreed to keep the dish... why ? At the end, it was your decision to go along with your sister. you are paying for it. Than you should have the final word in the decision. YTA\n\nThe way it should have gone in my opinion is: Your sister doesnt want to return the dish. You tell her if you keep it and you both eat it then she'll have to pay for it. If she agrees with that, than ok. If she doesn't, then you return it and ask for what you ordered. That is an easy situation. I don't understand putting someone against the wall like you did.\n\nYou were right for wanting to return the meal, but you decided otherwise. Too bad !\n\nThe way it ended was just you being petty and your relationship with your sister affected by it.\n\nIf you had returned the dish and she would have been pissed, than that would have been on her and you wouldn't have been an AH at all. But you are as much as she is.", "\"You must pay [whatever] PURELY BECAUSE  you are richer\" is such BS.", "OP, YTA. I understand your frustration in several fronts. However, your \u201cunspoken agreement\u201d that you will always pay should be revisited now, and you need to let her know at the time she\u2019s deciding to join you if you are paying or not. On her part, if you are paying for dinner, you should get to decide whether to send the dish back or not. Did you both eat the dish in the end? I think you should have paid as usual, and later talked through some new understandings about how you\u2019ll split the bill. YTA only because you didn\u2019t make it explicit AT THE TIME when you chose to keep the dish at her urging that you would expect her to pay for it. Maybe go out to places where you can split the bill comfortably in the future.", "ESH. Her for taking advantage of you financially. And you for springing this on her. If your habit is to pay, she had no reason to expect that would change. And she doesn\u2019t control you. Just because she said not to send it back doesn\u2019t mean you have to comply. Send it back anyway. Or tell her, \u201cI\u2019m sending it back unless you\u2019re willing to pay for it.\u201d", "You should have told her that she'd have to pay before you decided whether to send it back or not. What you did was kind of sneaky, so YTA.", "Info: Did you eat the unordered dish?", "YTA. If you didn\u2019t want to pay for the incorrect dish, you should have said so while there was still the option of sending it back. Then she could have decided if it was worth it to her or not.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to keep paying all the time, that\u2019s fine, but you need to be upfront about it. You don\u2019t get to change the arrangement after the food has already been eaten.", "Who ordered the dish they did not get and did they eat the food they did? \n\nIf I did not get the dish I ordered and the restaurant was busy or I did not want to wait while my dining companion ate, I would eat the \"wrong\" dish unless it was something I really couldn't stand. Of course, if the food was eaten, it had to be paid for.", "And the sister does not get to dictate how OP spends her money. OP did not want to keep the food but sis did. Sis can pay. \n\nWrong dishes get passed out sometimes. It happens. It is a busy restaurant. Most of the time the person running the food did not take the order so it could be a simple oversight. OP would have been absolutely reasonable in flagging down their server and saying they did not order this dish, they ordered dish x. They may have to wait a bit longer for their food, or if it recently came out, their dish that they did order could have still been in the back to be brought up. Asking to be served what you actually ordered is not an unreasonable expectation. Asking ones server to fix a mistake in a polite manner is also a reasonable thing to do.", "Yyyyyyyup", "Sure - but it\u2019s also possible that OP prefers only high end places that her sister couldn\u2019t otherwise afford. If OP pays for everything then that could be an issue, but maybe OP prefers going with sister to a fancy place (and paying) rather than splitting fast food.", "It does sound like BS that\u2019s just sort of how it goes when it comes to family. OP is probably ok with it because otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t be able to go out and she likes spending time with her.  \n  \nI\u2019ve done that before. Wanted to go to a nice place that I knew someone couldn\u2019t afford so I just covered it. Otherwise we woulda went somewhere cheaper that I wasn\u2019t in the mood for."]}
