She only started working again last year after her divorce (no monthly alimony but ex husband takes care of all their children\u2019s expenses; she has almost 6 figure USD from their joint bank account that is now hers) and now more or less has the salary of someone newly graduated from college.\n\nSo we ordered five dishes to share at the restaurant. The dishes came one by one and Laura and I chatted as we ate. The last one was supposed to be a steak of a certain cut of beef and specific side dishes. What was served looked nothing like what was on the menu. I called for a server to take it back and get us the right order but my sister stopped me.\n\nLaura said the restaurant was super busy and we shouldn\u2019t add burden to the already busy and hard working staff. She said we could just eat this dish we got by accident. She said some places the owners make the staff pay for this type of errors out of their own pocket and we should be kind.\n\nWhen the bill came, I told my sister she needed to pay for the dish we didn\u2019t order. Laura threw a fit, telling me I knew she didn\u2019t plan to spend this kind of money today as I have always paid. I said I told her to return the dish and she refused so paying for it was now her responsibility.\n\nLaura finally scraped together enough cash for the dish while I paid for the rest, my sister calling me AH for being so petty.

Than you should have the final word in the decision. YTA\n\nThe way it should have gone in my opinion is: Your sister doesnt want to return the dish. You tell her if you keep it and you both eat it then she'll have to pay for it. If she agrees with that, than ok. If she doesn't, then you return it and ask for what you ordered. That is an easy situation. I don't understand putting someone against the wall like you did.\n\nYou were right for wanting to return the meal, but you decided otherwise. Too bad !\n\nThe way it ended was just you being petty and your relationship with your sister affected by it.\n\nIf you had returned the dish and she would have been pissed, than that would have been on her and you wouldn't have been an AH at all.

On her part, if you are paying for dinner, you should get to decide whether to send the dish back or not. Did you both eat the dish in the end?

They may have to wait a bit longer for their food, or if it recently came out, their dish that they did order could have still been in the back to be brought up.
