It was probably like a huge weight had been lifted.\n\nThis. It's really difficult to exist with that expectation that you'll be the \"breadwinner\" and provide everything for your wife and family at all times. I personally vastly prefer buying my wife and kids things than myself, so I sympathise with wanting to be able to do that and how good it would feel to be able to do that when before I was unable. \n\nI do think OP's wife is TA for how he chose to behave with that, seriously so, and OP is right to be unhappy and I can't fault her for trying to bring him down a peg because frankly when someone gets that weird about money and paying for things then he probably isn't safe to rely on for finances anyway.", "I agree, this sounds more like an ESH situation. If the husband wasn't an AH prior to this raise, getting the raise and then being an AH could totally be more of an insecurity thing than an AH thing.  It doesn't make it right but it doesn't mean he was intentionally being an AH.  An honest conversation could've resolved this. Instead, OP harbored resentment and did a one-up maneuver.  That's an AH move.", "[removed]", "Yes. I think you hit the nail square on the head. It's a pretty toxic aspect of our culture that \"Real Men\" should be the providers and any man who doesn't earn the lions share of the household income is somehow less of a man. Equally as toxic as the idea a \"Real woman\" should be able to go out to work full time, do 100% of the childcare, 98% of the housework and act like a porn star in the bedroom. All without breaking a sweat, or smudging her perfect make-up. These ideals put far too much pressure on both men and women. Marriage is a partnership. You work together and how you split the work is up to the two of you and how you want to work it out.", "I don't think it's fucked up at all. Husband changed the power dynamic then used it to embarrass and belittle his wife. She got a higher paying job to stop his insults and barrages. I don't see how getting a higher paying job for the sole purpose of not being insulted is spiteful.", "Yeah see how much he likes it when he actually has to pay for everything. Alright hunny if I\u2019m just a useless woman spending your money I\u2019ll need you to pay all the bills and give me your credit card to use while I put my money in a savings account under my name.", "Yep, I am blind. Sorry!", "Ah yes. Never read a misleading title on this sub before for clickbait.. Still didn\u2019t answer the question.", "\u201cShe decides to show him he isn\u2019t really contributing \u201c \u2026.did you really just blame her for his short comings? \n\nThere is idiocy and there is malice. He acted in malice.", "Getting a better job = undermining him?  Yikes.", "How the fuck have I seen that movie and didn't pick it up?!\n\nThanks! Off to rewatch Role Models now.", "Don\u2019t you know it\u2019s her job as a woman to coddle her husband\u2019s feelings even when he\u2019s being sexist? If he doesn\u2019t get to put her down, then his peepee will fall off!", "Society is still quite patriarchal and men do face that pressure.  Being vulnerable to it isn't the problem but letting it take over is.", "Not that I know what the conversation was, but she did say  \n\n\n> I tried to talking about it with him multiple times, but he didn't understand the problem.\n\nSo it seemed like there was some attempt at communication.", ">If the husband wasn't an AH prior to this raise, getting the raise and then being an AH could totally be more of an insecurity thing than an AH thing.\n\nInsecure assholes are still assholes. OP tried talking with him about his constantly belittling her. Taking that high road didn't work.", "But he wasn't like this for just a short time when he was too happy with his new job and let him slip up. OP needed three months to find a new job and in this time he didn't shifted back to his behaviour pre-raise. So over three months he hold his money over her head, makes comments to others.

By OP\u2019s own admission, they got a better job just to \u201cbreak down\u201d their husband\u2019s ego. They found a higher paying job simply to knock their partner down a few pegs. I don\u2019t know why you need this explained to you, it\u2019s literally what this post is about.", "So why get a better job? If he's that malicious why is she staying in a marriage that's all about one upmanship? It's toxic and horrible.\n\nWhat she did was not addressing the actual issue -- that he was behaving poorly -- and all about rubbing his nose in it. The outcome will be shaming him, creating more tension in their marriage and making her feel dominant again. \n\nShe asked if she was TAH, and she was.", "In the ops post she directly says he has reasons to be insecure, but doesn\u2019t elaborate. This could be because she is trying to paint a bad guy picture. What led to those insecurities, was it brought up by her and the parents over and over? While he definitely currently is being an ah, this behavior absolutely could be actions cause consequences. Until I see op say they did not rub it in his face over and over him having a poor job, I\u2019ll say NAH, if she elaborates there is no cause from her or the family I\u2019ll change it to NTA", "Communication is a two way street. You can have the most perfect and truthful words in the universe, but they still won't go anywhere if the other person isn't willing to listen.", "Really communicating is getting through to your partner without acting petty like OP. \nReally communicating is not playing power games.
