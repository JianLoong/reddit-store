When we found out, I wasn't even five weeks along yet (I was 4 weeks and 3 days). We both knew we didn't want to have the baby, so we ordered the abortion pills online. At the time, we couldn't have them sent to my house, so they ended up going to his place, where his parents opened them.\nAfter my boyfriend got off work, they cornered him, and his mom started crying/screaming, saying how he couldn't do this and that the \"baby\" did nothing wrong, and that he had to make the right choice. From what he said, they talked about me as if I was nothing but an animal that had no say in what would happen. While they were talking to him, they insisted that I come over so that we could all talk about this. The only reason I ended up going was that they said if we didn't talk, they would kick him out.\n\n\n\nBoth of his parents are from Mexico, and his mother doesn't speak English, so I waited for five hours at his house for his dad to get back so we could talk. From the moment he walked into the house, he only talked to my boyfriend about making the right choice and started talking to me when his mother said something about me being in the room. He talked about how we should have been more responsible even though I was and still am on birth control and we've never done it without a condom. After listening to everything he said about my boyfriend making the right choice without yelling or raising my voice, I told him how he and his wife had no place getting in the middle of this and how it was disrespectful of him to insist on my coming to talk but then not talking to me and wasting my time. I also told him that they had no say in what I was going to do and to stay out of it and to just stay out of our relationship. \n\n\n\nAfter I said that, I was kicked out of the house. They then talked to my boyfriend about how disrespectful I was and how he should break up with me. They also said they would forget this happened and let it fade into the past. \n\n\nThis brings me to the present. my boyfriend and I are about to have our 2-year anniversary, and he mentioned it to his dad. My bf said they've realized that I'm not going anywhere anytime soon, so now they want to have a dinner where we can both apologize to each other and move on from it. But I don't think I should have to apologize for anything I said. They made something that had nothing to do with them about themselves and what they wanted. My boyfriend said I don't have to agree to go and that I should do what's best for me and my mental health, but friends of mine are saying it's wrong of me not to go because they want to say sorry and move on from this.  They said that I should go and say sorry because I need to think about the future since I could end up marrying him. So would it be wrong of me to not go to the dinner and just act like it didn\u2019t happen?", "created_utc": 1681955249, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12shu2b/wibta_if_i_dont_go_to_the_apologize_dinner_my/", "score": 149, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His parents treated you like an incubator and kicked you out of their house when you refused to play along. If you let this go and bow your head to 'keep the peace' you'll likely regret it far more in the long run. Because this won't be the last time it happens, guaranteed. \n\nAre you prepared to apologize when you do have kids and they feel you did something wrong and kick you out of their house again? Are you prepared to keep bowing down until your back breaks? Because that's your future. If they really wanted to bury the hatchet this apology dinner would be THEM apologizing to YOU. Not a dual apology that takes the heat off their backs.\n\nNTA. Seriously you're just 20, don't give in to this bullshit on the chance you might end up with this man. If he's really worth it he'll support you over his parents.", "YWNBTA because these folks clearly want you to apologize for an offense you didn\u2019t commit and if you attend, it will be expected/demanded. If you go and don\u2019t verbally and genuinely apologize to them - and you should not - they will make you the A H. They\u2019re taking a fake high road. You\u2019ll never have a good relationship with these nosy meddlers and one uncomfortable dinner isn\u2019t gonna fix that.", "NTA. They were wrong and you were right. It is good that they want to re-establish the relationship. But you do need to think about the future and that means ensuring that you are respected.", "NTA - your sorry for what exactly?  Two people who can't mind their own business?", "I wouldn't bother unless you see some kind of future with this guy and his family - and I seriously wonder what kind of future that would be, given their behavior toward you.\n\nYou certainly would NOT BTA if you didn't dine with these people, though to be fair I can understand why they might be freaked out given how young their son is. But if THEY want to apologize to YOU - let them. \n\nYou have nothing to apologize for, however.", "YWNBTA - honestly I'm surprised you still talk to them at all.", "Don\u2019t go. It will be another ambush. NTA", "Nta", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe them an apology. And you don\u2019t owe them forgiveness.", "You have absolutely nothing to apologize for.\n\nNTA", "You did nothing that warrants an apology to them. They were completely out of line. You drew your boundaries and held them which is what healthy people do. I see nothing wrong with you skipping the dinner. However if you're going to marry him you will have to deal with them. To a point when you marry someone, you marry their family. The ideal would be attend the dinner, to attempt to keep peace and not apologize. Don't apologize. You did nothing wrong and they don't deserve it. Let them apologize to you because you are sincerely owed one.", "NTA", "YWNBTA OP.\n\nYou don't have to apologise for telling them the truth and certainly had they wanted you to treat them with respect, they should have started by treating you with respect.\n\nIn any case you should do what is best for your mental health and yourself (though I'd suggest given the phrasing of what they want - i.e. that they want you to apologise - that you should say no and keep avoiding them).", "NTA\n\nAs others have said you'll never stop apologizing if you start now and you can BET his parents will bring up their \"lost\" grandchild as much as possible until they die, so there's also that. You can BET his entire extended family already knows.", "NTA.  I wouldn't want to have anything to do with people like that, they sound awful.  And just because people \"want to say sorry\" doesn't mean they get to, or that you have to forgive them and pretend it never happened.  I'm sorry doesn't just erase things, and some things can't be erased or forgotten.  But this may or may not be one of those things, that depends on how you feel. Evidently they have figured out that you are going to be in BF's life, so they want to try to pull you in to the family.  But people don't change, which means that like as not, they will continue to try to control things, they will continue to throw giant tantrums if you don't do what they want, and generally try to make you a player on their stage, rather than let you be the main character in your own life.  \n\nBut, having some kind of relationship with them may make things easier in the long run.  If you're willing to give things a shot, you can always go, refuse to apologize, see what they have to say, and leave if dinner becomes dinner drama theater part 2.  But even if they seem reasonable, I would be very cautious.", "NTA. But think about what the future of this relationship looks like", "NTA. Your feelings are valid, and it's understandable that you feel resentful about the way your boyfriend's parents treated you and intruded on your personal decisions. It's your choice whether or not to attend the dinner, and you should prioritize your own mental health and comfort.\n\nHowever, consider that this dinner might be an opportunity for you to build a more positive relationship with your boyfriend's parents, especially if you see a long-term future with him. They want to apologize and move forward, which could be a step in the right direction. It's important to remember that attending the dinner doesn't mean you're obligated to apologize for your own actions, but rather to accept their apology and attempt to move past the incident.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours, and you should do what feels right for you.", "Why was this reposted from a few days ago?", "You would not BTA if you didn't go.  However, it WILL make it a bigger deal if you don't. I would go.  Let them apologize and then thank them for their apology.

Tell them if they pay you $4,000, you'll accept any apology. If they don't, then that means there applogy is essentially worthless (it holds no value). This will put them in the position of \"fuck her, we're not paying\" or \"ok will pay since the relationship with you is more important.\" \n\nI do this all the time, I remember my father forked over $6000 because I gained nothing from talking for years but he wanted someone to talk too.

All day. First they OPENED YOUR MAIL. BIG, HUGE no deal.

But absolutely do NOT apologize. Not even a fake, half-hearted one like so many others are suggesting. This commentator is correct - that will set a precedent you don't want. They'll think it's OK to treat you like trash bc you'll ultimately bend to \"keep the peace.\" What they did to you was horrible (acting like you're just a walking incubator with no agency, how gross), and they should apologize. Going to dinner gives them this chance. It also gives you a chance to see if they've grown at all and now understand how irrepressible their behavior was. Or if they still think they were right and don't really respect you as an individual. It'll be very telling if they try demanding an apology from you, how they handle a respectful, justified refusal, and/or how your BF reacts. Is he really willing to defend you if things go south, his parents continue being unreasonable? Or is he paying lip service? You might also consider telling them beforehand your expectations for dinner. That you're willing to attend and hear them out, entertain their apology but shouldn't necessarily expect one from you .", "I don't talk to them at all but I do talk to his four younger siblings.

I reposted it because I still don't know what to do. I would like to hear from people without it just becoming a big fight. But I also got a lot of hate full messages so I would just like advice and not hate.", "I don't think they've grown at all. They told him not too long ago that he has to watch out for me and my family because we might hurt or unalive him. They've also said that he has to stop thinking about the sex I give him and start thinking about the future/ having a family because \u201c she's not the type of woman that could give him that\u201d. Also, this was the first time I had met them.", "Keeping the peace often just means appeasing bullies or abusers.", "What peace? Right now, it's a truce, at best.", "To be honest OP, the only reason they're having this dinner is because they expect that you and their son will get married/have children and this is their way to getting a foot in the door.\n\nBased on their approach here, you're going to have to deal with micro-aggression from them.\n\nI'd suggest you figure out how to firmly establish boundaries and exactly how much you want them to be part of the lives of you and your boyfriend and any future children you might have.", "If keeping the peace means you apologize for their mistake, then I'd opt out.", "You're right. if I do end up going and not apologizing I would probably be called all sorts of names and played for a fool.", "They're already playing you for the fool tbh.  Their 'peace offering' is like an apology that starts 'I'm sorry people got their feelings hurt'.  Which is to say, that isn't an apology and a request that you apologise for their behaviour is not a peace offering.  Them making it implies they think you don't see what they're doing.", "NTA. If they're talking about both sides apologizing, they're not sorry.", "why are you reposting this. you weren't the asshoke last time why would it be different this time", "NTA. I hate to assume the worst of people, but when you've seen their worst, it's hard not to - the standard has been set. I'd be concerned they're only apologizing to get access to potential future grandchildren. If you WANTED you could go to the dinner, but I'd make it clear you're not apologizing before you commit to that - otherwise you might get trapped at that table by social obligation and have a second parental meltdown while ignoring you", "Uh, they've basically given you a preview of what the rest of your life will be like. They'll insist on being part of every decision you make and they'll berate you and threaten both of you if you go against them. If you have kids they'll take over the parenting or criticize yours. I'm sure your fiance is great, but this is what the rest of your life will be like if you marry him and he stays in contact with them. NTA", "You have nothing for which to apologize. I\u2019d go LC with them. They are very rude and have no regard for you. NTA and avoid them. They will only attack you again for some other reason."]}
