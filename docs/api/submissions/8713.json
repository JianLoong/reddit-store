They enjoy the same kinds of dysfunction and habits. \n\nSo she recently decides that she wants to start coming to family dinners a few times a week, and has been telling everyone how good she is doing, being nice to the kids, helping clean up,, ect. \n\nThe other night, after a few glasses of wine mind you, she takes me aside and let's me know she is \"cleaning up her act\" and wants me to help her convince dad and step mom to let her move back in because... she is pregnant...\n\nShe says she is going to need help raising the baby, and it would make things so much easier because they already have all the baby stuff and the house is basically already set up for a baby. \n\nShe was telling me how excited she was and asked my thoughts, and I was honest with her. I told her it was terrifying, and that she was in no way mature enough to do this, and that even her \"changes\" were for selfish reasons. \n\nI also told her I wasn't going to support the idea of her moving home if I was asked about it. \n\nShe ended up getting really upset at me and storming out, and when my dad asked what happened I told him.

Punishing your sister is punishing that child.\n\nEven if you are taken for a ride by your sister, at least the baby has a chance of being protected from whatever self destructive behaviours she chooses.\n\nSo for that reason, i'm saying **YTA**", "I missed the \u201cafter a few glasses of wine\u2026.\u201d Meaning. \n\nDamn!", "Yeah, fetal alcohol syndrome is no joke", "Sadly many people don't have any idea of the lifelong impacts prenatal alcohol exposure can have on an individual.\n\nNot saying that it is any excuse for the sister's deplorable behaviour, but the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and FASD need to be talked about more in society and all people of childbearing age should be educated about it.", "Here's a reputable link with the most up-to-date research history about FASD. It is a Canadian resource, but the info is good in any country.\n\nwww.canfasd.ca", "It\u2019s ma\u2019am ha but I like the sound of being called sir.", "The nm-tx border literally runs through my childhood yard.

I wanted to know if they\u2019ve actually adopted since it would be fucking stupid to recommend something you haven\u2019t done or tried yourself.

Shes using your family, and wants you to lie so she can get her way. Good riddance.

She's young and immature, but with support and guidance, she likely has the potential to step up and be a good mother.\n\nShe needs professional help, not to be forced or bullied into having an abortion that she doesn't want. Do you have any idea what that does to a woman? It's reproductive abuse.\n\nOffering support to pregnant women isn't \"delusional\", it's essential. She wants to raise her child, which means she needs support from her loved ones (not to be enabled, but offered resources to allow her to help herself and her baby).\n\nCrisis pregnancy centres exist to help support women who want to raise their babies or place them for adoption. They connect women and their babies to crucial resources, from housing and employment to adoption agencies. If OP's sister has a problem with drugs and/or alcohol, they can connect her to therapeutic programs that will help her stay sober. \n\nShe's made her choice, but you want OP to pressure and manipulate her into making a different one. If you were \"pro-choice\", you'd accept her *choice* to keep and raise her child. \n\nBullying women into having abortions they don't want is not about \"choice\", it's about exerting control. It's highly abusive behaviour and commonly seen in domestic violence situations.\n\nNo woman should ever be forced into an abortion, or made to feel as though she has no other option. It's not a \"choice\" when you convince her that she has no other options.\n\nYou never tell someone that they \"need abortion\" and should abort their child. What the hell is wrong with you?", "And that is why commas were invented!", "It's not unpopular in the real world.\n\nSaying that \"people like her need abortion\" is also far worse than merely *suggesting* adoption.

Convincing a woman that she has no other option other than to terminate a pregnancy is the definition of being \"against choice\". \n\nIt's not a \"choice\" when you've been made to feel as though you have no other way out.\n\nShe wants to keep her child. If you cared about \"choice\", you'd respect her choice. Coercing or forcing a woman into an abortion is reproductive abuse. \n\nEven telling a woman that she \"needs\" abortion demonstrates being \"against choice\". She's made her choice, quit trying to bully and manipulate her into changing her mind.", "Why should that matter?\n\nYou don't have to have personally lived through something in order to advocate for or against it.\n\nIf you only speak up about topics that personally involve or affect you, that's very self-centred.\n\nUnlike almost everyone else in this particular thread, I'm not telling OP what her sister should or shouldn't do regarding her child. I just corrected misinformation and a misconception that a lot of people have surrounding adoption.", "And I wanted to know if that person has adopted a child so I asked.

But what I always think about such posts, that Parents are responsible for the upbringing of the children. Your father is partly to blame for your sister's behavior.
