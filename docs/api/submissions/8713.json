Our mom died when we were young(parents were divorced by then), dad remarried  few years ago and we now have a 4 year old brother and a 2 year old sister. We all were living at home.\n\nMy sister didn't like our step mom from the start, so things were always kind of tense at home, and she did not handle having more siblings well. \n\nShe was always the baby and spoiled and entitled, and when the lils came along she started rebelling and basically has made life hell for everyone in the house.\n\n She was coming home drunk constantly at all hours,, she would be agressive and belligerent, especially twords my step mom.\n\nShe basically resents the lils and would litterally refuse to interact with them, would flat out ignore them, tell them to get away from her and call them names, refused to help in any way. \n\nMy dad and step mom kicked her out a few months backwhen they found drugs in her purse, by the door, where the lil ones could have gotten into it. \n\nSince then she has been living with the bf of the month, also a real peach. They enjoy the same kinds of dysfunction and habits. \n\nSo she recently decides that she wants to start coming to family dinners a few times a week, and has been telling everyone how good she is doing, being nice to the kids, helping clean up,, ect. \n\nThe other night, after a few glasses of wine mind you, she takes me aside and let's me know she is \"cleaning up her act\" and wants me to help her convince dad and step mom to let her move back in because... she is pregnant...\n\nShe says she is going to need help raising the baby, and it would make things so much easier because they already have all the baby stuff and the house is basically already set up for a baby. \n\nShe was telling me how excited she was and asked my thoughts, and I was honest with her. I told her it was terrifying, and that she was in no way mature enough to do this, and that even her \"changes\" were for selfish reasons. \n\nI also told her I wasn't going to support the idea of her moving home if I was asked about it. \n\nShe ended up getting really upset at me and storming out, and when my dad asked what happened I told him. He was not happy, and assured me that he would not be letting her move back in. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1675105645, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pb0al/aita_for_telling_my_sister_thats_terrifying_when/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She sits there drinking wine while pregnant, then acts insulted when you say she isn't mature enough to have a baby?\n\nEspecially strange since her current plan to care for said kid is \"I'll make my parents do it.\"\n\nIt's clear she's highly manipulative, immature, and self-absorbed. I hope you and your parents will be there for the poor kid when she inevitably neglects it.", "that is terrifying, geez NTA. she asked you answered. Don\u2019t ask if you don\u2019t wanna know", "Couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the title of your post because your response is truthful and hilarious. But after reading more it truly is terrifying. She\u2019s pregnant and drinking for one not the mention all the other things. People like this need abortion not delusional support. NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou were honest, and she can\u2018t *expect* help or appreciation.\n\nShe should\u2018ve made sure that she can provide everything for the baby and that she has a definite plan before getting pregnant.", "NTA.  And with all due respect, am worried about her offspring.  based on how you described her behavior and the dynamics she created, it certainly is terrifying.", "NTA\n\nWow.  She is jealous of no longer being the baby and getting all the attention so she makes a baby to get the attention again. Heaven help her child.", "NTA. You guys won\u2019t be her free childcare while she continues to party. She has to grow up. And her bf needs to take care of his own.", "NTA\n\nShe asked for your help, you told her no and gave your reasons. \n\nUltimately, the decision to move back home is between her, your dad and stepmother. \n\nIf your parents are done having babies, they might be happy to pass along all their gear as their youngest will be 3 by the time your sister's baby is born. \n\nShe's not asking to come home for the gear, she wants to come home so that someone else will be responsible for her child. \n\nIf she continues down this path, you and your folks will be getting a drug addled infant in 6-8 months as the child will likely be removed from her care. But she still shouldn't be allowed to move back home. Also, this would be the time for your folks to talk to her about getting herself healthy and adopting out the baby.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't support her moving back in due to her manipulation and behavior.  Question asked, question answered.  Sadly, if she's still drinking when she knows she's pregnant, and has a history of drug use with BF, then she's possibly still using.  Poor kid.", "If she is only cleaning up her act because she needs something, then it is not a genuine change. A facade will only last for so long and eventually the mask will fall away. \n\nIt's good you told your dad what's up. He needs to know what your sisters' true intentions are. If your sister being there is going to make life hell for everybody else, as sad and unfortunate as it is- she should not be allowed to move back in. There are other people that live in that house that deserve peace and to not be belittled or feel unwelcomed in their own home. \n\nYour NTA for telling her that her being pregnant was terrifying. You know her and she was already a few glasses of wine in. She didn't make a very good impression of a healthy change. She admits the selfish side to her intentions and indicates no personal growth (just manipulation). \n\nI do hope that she seeks whatever help she may need. She deserves to be healthy and happy. She just needs a bit of help to get to that point. She has to want to put in the work towards getting mentally healthy. \n\nMaybe your dad can do a bit of research on places or people that can help her as she needs. Him putting the rest of the family in distress to try and help your sister isn't going to be the right move. Helping her get the help she needs is best in this situation. If she refuses help, then that is on her.", "NTA. \n\nNot only did you speak the truth, you helped your family see her as the manipulative and immature person she is. \n\nMaybe she did actually change, maybe she hasn't. Her actions will bear her out. But the fact that she only came back to pretend play nice until she got what was good for her does not bode well for these supposed changes.", "NTA. No no no no no", "NTA\n\nAlso, this:\n\n>after a few glasses of wine \\[...\\] let's me know \\[...\\] she is pregnant\n\nExcuse me, but wtf? I really hope it was only you drinking that wine, not her!\n\nDo you have any idea what alcohol does to an unborn child?!", "I promise you that it does not take anymore time to type \u201clittle.\u201d ESH.", "ESH.\n\nShe sucks for the obvious reasons you pointed out.\n\nAs for you, you're not necessarily wrong, but I'm not sure you're really helping. If she's making improvements to herself and how she interacts with family, you don't need to shit on her for that - if the \"changes' are for selfish reasons, then so what? The important thing is that she makes the changes.\n\nYou don't need to support her and you have reason to be suspicious of how she'll act going forward, but don't try and cut her down.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Getting pregnant is the opposite of getting her act together.  She needs to live with the consequences of her actions.  Maybe your parents not letting her move back will encourage her to terminate or put the baby up for adoption.", "Absolutely NTA. She was incredibly shitty to little kids, and doing drugs/alcohol, but decides to \"clean her act up\" just so she can get everyone but her to take care of this baby. On top of that, she's not even cleaning her act up, because she's still drinking multiple glasses of wine while pregnant, let alone what she could be doing at home with her boyfriend. You are absolutely correct in saying that she is not mature enough for a baby, and in saying that her \"changes\" were selfish. Once again, absolutely not the asshole here.", "You helped your dad and family dodge a bullet.

She sucks, clearly. But you sort of do too--you could have simply said this wasn't your call (you don't get to decide who lives in your dad's/stepmom's home) and that she needed to take it up with them--rather than telling her why you thought she was being an a-hole. I get that she has a lot of issues and you want to help, but you can't force her to do anything.", "NTA\n\nCall CPS and let them know she's unfit to be a parent.

Your sister is toxic and would be an awful mom.  You'll be expected to babysit full time while she keeps on partying."]}
