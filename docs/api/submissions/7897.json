My coworker, Shawn (27 M) is autistic and frequently misses social cues and sometimes throws tantrums when overstimulated, when there\u2019s a change happening, or when he doesn\u2019t get his way. Shawn does not work in my department, but he stops by everyday because he\u2019s bored and needs something to do. My department doesn\u2019t mind in general as we all feel bad that Shawn has nothing to do, so at times my coworkers give him small errands to run. As soon as I started working there, everyday when Shawn would come around he would flirt with me. He would say the same exact thing, \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty\u201d \u201cYou look nice today\u201d \u201cCan I have your number\u201d and one day he would not leave until I took his number, and another he said he wanted to go on a date. It was extremely awkward for me because he would stare without blinking at me during this entire script he\u2019d go through and not leave for a long time even when I repeatedly tell him I have to work and I am married. I always made sure to be kind to him as I understand his limitations, however I didn\u2019t feel I should put up with being harassed  just because of that. I also didn\u2019t want to say anything because I just started working at this job and felt it would look bad to start complaining right away. \n\nI finally told my boss what\u2019s been going on with Shawn 2 weeks ago. She was very upset that he was behaving that way with me and said she\u2019d talk to his boss. A week later we find out Shawn was fired- we don\u2019t know the exact details of how it happened. Yesterday his mom came by. I thought security called me for my uber eats delivery but it turned out to be her. She started begging me to speak to Shawn\u2019s boss to tell him it was a lie and that he\u2019s a good person so he can get his job back. I refused to speak with her and started to go back upstairs so she cursed me out as I left. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if I should have not said anything to my boss and just dealt with the situation.

You were mearly discussed his behavior.", "NTA, I am a mother of two boys, both of which are on the spectrum. This is something he should have been taught growing up, or at the very least supported with understanding as an adult. You've done nothing wrong, and from the mother's reaction, I think it's not difficult to understand why he's not had this supported properly.", "NTA. You don't deserve to be sexually harassed by anyone.", "NTA - Autism is not a free pass to sexually harass a co-worker. Being autistic doesn\u2019t mean that you cannot learn what behaviours are unacceptable or harmful to others, and if they\u2019re capable of holding a job that requires them to interact with people, they\u2019re capable of learning that it\u2019s not ok to harass people.", "NTA. First, you were harassed repeatedly, you told him you were married, not interested, etc and he still kept coming back. Autistic or not, he needs to learn to read the room so to speak. As for his mother coming and cursing you out, that\u2019s an entire different situation. I hope you reported her to your boss, his old boss, security etc. Anyone who feels that they can do something like that isn\u2019t healthy. Not for you, or for Shawn.

I could understand if you were not clear.

To this day, and he\u2019s 28, he still blames his mom for \u201cruining his life\u201d by telling him that he must stop talking and writing love letters to a girl when he was 17.  There is no way you could have known that your attempts to shut down the harassment would be to stomp on him with your words.  And that\u2019s not appropriate for a co-worker.  Maybe there would have been a way for you to have a sit down with you, his boss, and him where you and your boss could have been very firm together, but now I\u2019m armchair quarterbacking.  The mom was a total AH for coming to your work, btw. That said, I agree with other posters that there were maybe other issues.

I recently had a meeting with an employer of a young person I support (Jamie - not real name) where we discussed some inappropriate comments and behaviours (not about dating or anything related to relationships but still conversations which made others uncomfortable).\n\nIt was agreed that I would work with the employer to make a set of boundaries in the work place specifically for Jamie to ensure that they had a clear understand of how some comments made others feel and what constitutes inappropriate workplace behaviour. \n\nThese are the steps that I would have suggested that the employer makes, however for your part in this whole thing, you did absolutely nothing wrong. It seems like both within and out with work that Shawn needs a little more support. There might be a program that his mum can get him into which will help with group-working environments in a more supported place before he is ready to go back out into the workforce.", "NTA. Sexual harassment is sexual harassment, you weren't lying and he was fired for a just cause.

I've been in your situation with a colleague in my field and because I was nice to him and didn't set boundaries, he went around telling mutual colleagues that he wishes to use me  to gain some experience in sex because he was a virgin and I was \"easy\". I was married at the time and had done absolutely nothing to imply that perception of me. The only thing I did was not stop him or file a complaint about him when his gestures became too aggressive.

Telling him you are married and you have to work doesn\u2019t exactly answer his question because he knows that married people sometimes cheat/divorce and having to work doesn\u2019t address the question.\n\nAdmittedly there\u2019s still a chance that might not have worked (in similar circumstances I was harassed for nearly 3 years by a colleague who, about a month after me setting a very clear boundary, famously came out with the phrase \u201cI thought you meant no kissing, cuddling or dating\u2026 I didn\u2019t think you was ending the relationship\u201d (like, dude\u2026 without those things, WHAT RELATIONSHIP?).

Parents who use autisim as an excuse for everything deny their children the social, mental, and emotional development that an adult needs. Adults who use it as they want aren't healthy individuals.\n\nIf Shawn was working with you, he was evaluated to be someone who can work at your level. Reporting Shawn was, in no way, a bad thing.

He continued to bother you, even when you said \"I'm married\". There's no way he didn't notice that. As someone who does have a form of autism, I miss social cues.

Aside from what everyone else has already mentioned (especially that there was probably other reasons he got fired and your experience was the last straw), I have a suspicion the mother had the audacity to come ask specifically for you and verbally attack you at work is because she was probably dependent on his income from the job.

There's a great blog post on the \"Doctor Nerd Love\" website (weird title, I know) titled \"Socially Awkward Isn't an Excuse.\"  In short, it states that even people who lack social skills (such as those with autism) are capable of learning when certain behaviors aren't appropriate, and being socially awkward shouldn't be an excuse to sexually harass people.  I feel for Shawn, but at the same time he needs to learn that his behavior isn't acceptable.\n\nAlso, the fact that his mom wants you to LIE to your boss to get him his job back indicates that she's not interested in teaching him proper social skills, but expects the entire world to revolve around him.  As someone with autism who had to teach myself these skills, this is always infuriating to see.  Yes, some accommodation from others is appreciated, but most of us don't expect the entire world to bend to our needs.", "NTA. Understandably being on the spectrum is hard. I have a son who is autistic and I will be getting assessed myself as I show a lot of cues just like my son. Anyway to my point. Regardless of the circumstances he has. He still needs to learn there are consequences to his actions. Yes more care may be needed in explaining that to him compared to your regular Joe. So his boss may have been better of giving him a stern talking to and warn him not to do it again or there will be severe consequences, regardless if it was to you or another member of staff.
