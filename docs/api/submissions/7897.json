My coworker, Shawn (27 M) is autistic and frequently misses social cues and sometimes throws tantrums when overstimulated, when there\u2019s a change happening, or when he doesn\u2019t get his way. Shawn does not work in my department, but he stops by everyday because he\u2019s bored and needs something to do. My department doesn\u2019t mind in general as we all feel bad that Shawn has nothing to do, so at times my coworkers give him small errands to run. As soon as I started working there, everyday when Shawn would come around he would flirt with me. He would say the same exact thing, \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty\u201d \u201cYou look nice today\u201d \u201cCan I have your number\u201d and one day he would not leave until I took his number, and another he said he wanted to go on a date. It was extremely awkward for me because he would stare without blinking at me during this entire script he\u2019d go through and not leave for a long time even when I repeatedly tell him I have to work and I am married. I always made sure to be kind to him as I understand his limitations, however I didn\u2019t feel I should put up with being harassed  just because of that. I also didn\u2019t want to say anything because I just started working at this job and felt it would look bad to start complaining right away. \n\nI finally told my boss what\u2019s been going on with Shawn 2 weeks ago. She was very upset that he was behaving that way with me and said she\u2019d talk to his boss. A week later we find out Shawn was fired- we don\u2019t know the exact details of how it happened. Yesterday his mom came by. I thought security called me for my uber eats delivery but it turned out to be her. She started begging me to speak to Shawn\u2019s boss to tell him it was a lie and that he\u2019s a good person so he can get his job back. I refused to speak with her and started to go back upstairs so she cursed me out as I left. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if I should have not said anything to my boss and just dealt with the situation. I do feel bad that Shawn was fired.", "created_utc": 1674305279, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hqho0/aita_for_causing_my_autistic_coworker_to_be_fired/", "score": 178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am positive there was more to the story and what happened to you was just the last straw.  If it had been a one off, they would have talked to him and possibly moved him around.  Sounds like there was more going on.", "NTA . He was harrsing you. If he wasn't autistic he would have been fired for the exact same behavior. You didn't go to your boss to get him fired.  You were mearly discussed his behavior.", "NTA, I am a mother of two boys, both of which are on the spectrum. This is something he should have been taught growing up, or at the very least supported with understanding as an adult. You've done nothing wrong, and from the mother's reaction, I think it's not difficult to understand why he's not had this supported properly.", "NTA. You don't deserve to be sexually harassed by anyone.", "NTA - Autism is not a free pass to sexually harass a co-worker. Being autistic doesn\u2019t mean that you cannot learn what behaviours are unacceptable or harmful to others, and if they\u2019re capable of holding a job that requires them to interact with people, they\u2019re capable of learning that it\u2019s not ok to harass people.", "NTA. First, you were harassed repeatedly, you told him you were married, not interested, etc and he still kept coming back. Autistic or not, he needs to learn to read the room so to speak. As for his mother coming and cursing you out, that\u2019s an entire different situation. I hope you reported her to your boss, his old boss, security etc. Anyone who feels that they can do something like that isn\u2019t healthy. Not for you, or for Shawn. She\u2019s protecting him where she should be using this as a teachable moment.", "NTA - it is fine to make concessions that help people, but being harassed is not a concession that you should ha e to make.", "NTA.\n\nAutism may \"explain\" why he did that but it DOES NOT excuse his actions.", "NTA - Autism is not an excuse for not accepting something you are told directly. I could understand if you were not clear. But language such as \u201cI\u2019m married\u201d is not subtle, \u201cI need to work\u201d could be misinterpreted as \u201cI would if it wasn\u2019t for my work\u201d so that\u2019s worth considering in future.\n\nComplete speculation but I doubt he would have been fired based on your complaint alone. If the issue was raised and he was not able to take criticism on board from his manager it may have been felt that the company could not risk him continuing the harassment. Your complaint may not have been the first. It\u2019s sad but it\u2019s not your fault for raising the concern. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to put up with harassment.", "NTA, being autistic is not an excuse to harass someone... done", "NTA.\n\nYou did nothing wrong and that he got fired wasn\u2019t your decision.", "NTA - Mental disabilities aside you have the right to work without being harassed.

Especially after you turned down his requests several times. You did the right thing and told your boss, what she is doing with that is *on her*. It\u2019s her company and if she think it\u2019s necessary to fire him, well, then it is what it is. And the request of his mother is inappropriate. I\u2019m sure that she thinks her son is a good person, but other peoples boundaries have to be respected and protected too.", "NTA: you were almost too restrained in your complaint, there's never an excuse for you to feel uncomfortable by unwanted advances in your place of work. Your employers probably could have done a better job with how Shawn's termination was handled, regardless of how he received the message they could have asked his mom to come in and help with the communication aspect. His mom had no right to ask you to lie about the harassment.", "NTA.  You aren\u2019t the reason Shawn got fired.  His actions towards you might have contributed to it, but there was most likely a history of repeated warnings.", "NTA autism isn\u2019t a magical get out of jail free card.", "You did not cause him to be fired, he was sexually harassing you full stop. You should have reported him much sooner. You have a right to a safe workplace. NTA", "NTA. autist here. he needed that lesson. his mother seems like an enabler, who would rather cover for Shawn than teach him the social rules. we might not do well with those rules and cannot learn them via osmosis like most people, but we can be taught those rules and follow them.\n\nalso, i would be surprised if this was Shawn's first strike.", "NTA!!!! OMG he gets like 1 or 2 passes because he\u2019s autistic but you do not deserve to be HARASSED!!! And he kept going on and on and on. I get that he doesn\u2019t get social cues\u2026 but the reality is you should not have to be forced to be in that situation. And the audacity of his mom to show up to the workplace!!!! Omg. First of all, you did not make the decision to fire him. You reported a really uncomfortable situation after it was going on for a long time and you kindly expressed your desire for him to stop.\n\nIf the mom wanted to fight for another chance for her son, she should have been talking to your boss not you! But even then she shouldn\u2019t be showing up to the workplace and cussing people out. jeez", "NTA This didn't just happen once or twice. It was a regular occurrence that made you feel incredibly uncomfortable. I'm willing to bet his tantrums had been noted too. This kinda sounds like a final straw.", "I don\u2019t think being autistic is an excuse for you to accept harassment NTA", "I have an autistic stepson, and he had this issue too.  The problem is obsession like we can\u2019t even comprehend.  To this day, and he\u2019s 28, he still blames his mom for \u201cruining his life\u201d by telling him that he must stop talking and writing love letters to a girl when he was 17.  There is no way you could have known that your attempts to shut down the harassment would be to stomp on him with your words.  And that\u2019s not appropriate for a co-worker.  Maybe there would have been a way for you to have a sit down with you, his boss, and him where you and your boss could have been very firm together, but now I\u2019m armchair quarterbacking.  The mom was a total AH for coming to your work, btw. That said, I agree with other posters that there were maybe other issues.  Don\u2019t people usually get an oral warning, then a written warning before they are terminated?  Hopefully he will find employment elsewhere.\nEdit to add NTA", "NTA probably not his 1st strike as well.", "NTA. You have a every right to feel uncomfortable. This wouldn't be his first warning, your rightful complaint was his last warning.\n\nThey have workers and new workers they need to protect.", "NTA. You were the last person Shawn got to sexually harrass, you were not the first. So don't feel bad. And the fact his mother inserted herself into the whole situation is very telling.", "NTA. \n\nBut damn. HR or your bosses name dropped you to Shawn??  That is crazy.  His mother had no business coming there.", "NTA Case closed.", "NTA. \n\nI work with young adults, many of whom have additional support needs, including autism or learning difficulties. I recently had a meeting with an employer of a young person I support (Jamie - not real name) where we discussed some inappropriate comments and behaviours (not about dating or anything related to relationships but still conversations which made others uncomfortable).\n\nIt was agreed that I would work with the employer to make a set of boundaries in the work place specifically for Jamie to ensure that they had a clear understand of how some comments made others feel and what constitutes inappropriate workplace behaviour. \n\nThese are the steps that I would have suggested that the employer makes, however for your part in this whole thing, you did absolutely nothing wrong. It seems like both within and out with work that Shawn needs a little more support. There might be a program that his mum can get him into which will help with group-working environments in a more supported place before he is ready to go back out into the workforce.", "NTA. Sexual harassment is sexual harassment, you weren't lying and he was fired for a just cause. Yes, it sucks for him that he doesn't get social clues, but the straight-up \"no\" he definitely did get and just didn't want to stop. And that's on him.", "NTA. I've been in your situation with a colleague in my field and because I was nice to him and didn't set boundaries, he went around telling mutual colleagues that he wishes to use me  to gain some experience in sex because he was a virgin and I was \"easy\". I was married at the time and had done absolutely nothing to imply that perception of me. The only thing I did was not stop him or file a complaint about him when his gestures became too aggressive. Like a comment mentioned earlier, being autistic doesn't excuse this behavior.\n \nEdit: he continued behaving this way with many other women.", "As an autistic person i will say that it may be an explanation for certain behaviors but it is NOT an excuse.", "I\u2019m autistic and autistic people can understand consent just fine and if you were repeatedly saying no, and I\u2019m married, then he knows what he\u2019s doing", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Telling him you are married and you have to work doesn\u2019t exactly answer his question because he knows that married people sometimes cheat/divorce and having to work doesn\u2019t address the question.\n\nAdmittedly there\u2019s still a chance that might not have worked (in similar circumstances I was harassed for nearly 3 years by a colleague who, about a month after me setting a very clear boundary, famously came out with the phrase \u201cI thought you meant no kissing, cuddling or dating\u2026 I didn\u2019t think you was ending the relationship\u201d (like, dude\u2026 without those things, WHAT RELATIONSHIP?). My mistake in that instance was using phrases like \u201cright now\u201d or \u201cat the moment\u201d to describe my wish to remain single - apparently that was not clear enough that it meant \u201cnever\u201d in his case.\n\nIn that event when I finally reported it (2.5 years down the line) management intervention (and I think, on the quiet, a believable threat of violence from one of the managers if he contacted me again) mostly resolved the issue, and nobody had to get fired over it.\n\nBut you were not obligated to do that or to interact with someone making you uncomfortable and even without that, it seems like the managers are the real assholes here for keeping someone underemployed and not setting workplace behaviour expectations more clearly early on with him. They also appear not to have communicated effectively on how his behaviour contributed to him getting fired; it\u2019s possible that they didn\u2019t really have a role for him but had been threatened with a discrimination suit from the mother if they got rid of him so they used you as an excuse - but that\u2019s very poor management on their part however you look at it.", "NTA.
