My coworker, Shawn (27 M) is autistic and frequently misses social cues and sometimes throws tantrums when overstimulated, when there\u2019s a change happening, or when he doesn\u2019t get his way. Shawn does not work in my department, but he stops by everyday because he\u2019s bored and needs something to do. My department doesn\u2019t mind in general as we all feel bad that Shawn has nothing to do, so at times my coworkers give him small errands to run. As soon as I started working there, everyday when Shawn would come around he would flirt with me. He would say the same exact thing, \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty\u201d \u201cYou look nice today\u201d \u201cCan I have your number\u201d and one day he would not leave until I took his number, and another he said he wanted to go on a date. It was extremely awkward for me because he would stare without blinking at me during this entire script he\u2019d go through and not leave for a long time even when I repeatedly tell him I have to work and I am married. I always made sure to be kind to him as I understand his limitations, however I didn\u2019t feel I should put up with being harassed  just because of that. I also didn\u2019t want to say anything because I just started working at this job and felt it would look bad to start complaining right away. \n\nI finally told my boss what\u2019s been going on with Shawn 2 weeks ago. She was very upset that he was behaving that way with me and said she\u2019d talk to his boss. A week later we find out Shawn was fired- we don\u2019t know the exact details of how it happened. Yesterday his mom came by. I thought security called me for my uber eats delivery but it turned out to be her. She started begging me to speak to Shawn\u2019s boss to tell him it was a lie and that he\u2019s a good person so he can get his job back. I refused to speak with her and started to go back upstairs so she cursed me out as I left. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if I should have not said anything to my boss and just dealt with the situation.

You were mearly discussed his behavior.", "NTA, I am a mother of two boys, both of which are on the spectrum. This is something he should have been taught growing up, or at the very least supported with understanding as an adult.

You don't deserve to be sexually harassed by anyone.", "NTA - Autism is not a free pass to sexually harass a co-worker. Being autistic doesn\u2019t mean that you cannot learn what behaviours are unacceptable or harmful to others, and if they\u2019re capable of holding a job that requires them to interact with people, they\u2019re capable of learning that it\u2019s not ok to harass people.", "NTA. First, you were harassed repeatedly, you told him you were married, not interested, etc and he still kept coming back. Autistic or not, he needs to learn to read the room so to speak. As for his mother coming and cursing you out, that\u2019s an entire different situation. I hope you reported her to your boss, his old boss, security etc. Anyone who feels that they can do something like that isn\u2019t healthy. Not for you, or for Shawn.

To this day, and he\u2019s 28, he still blames his mom for \u201cruining his life\u201d by telling him that he must stop talking and writing love letters to a girl when he was 17.  There is no way you could have known that your attempts to shut down the harassment would be to stomp on him with your words.  And that\u2019s not appropriate for a co-worker.  Maybe there would have been a way for you to have a sit down with you, his boss, and him where you and your boss could have been very firm together, but now I\u2019m armchair quarterbacking.  The mom was a total AH for coming to your work, btw. That said, I agree with other posters that there were maybe other issues.

I recently had a meeting with an employer of a young person I support (Jamie - not real name) where we discussed some inappropriate comments and behaviours (not about dating or anything related to relationships but still conversations which made others uncomfortable).\n\nIt was agreed that I would work with the employer to make a set of boundaries in the work place specifically for Jamie to ensure that they had a clear understand of how some comments made others feel and what constitutes inappropriate workplace behaviour. \n\nThese are the steps that I would have suggested that the employer makes, however for your part in this whole thing, you did absolutely nothing wrong. It seems like both within and out with work that Shawn needs a little more support. There might be a program that his mum can get him into which will help with group-working environments in a more supported place before he is ready to go back out into the workforce.", "NTA. Sexual harassment is sexual harassment, you weren't lying and he was fired for a just cause.

I've been in your situation with a colleague in my field and because I was nice to him and didn't set boundaries, he went around telling mutual colleagues that he wishes to use me  to gain some experience in sex because he was a virgin and I was \"easy\". I was married at the time and had done absolutely nothing to imply that perception of me. The only thing I did was not stop him or file a complaint about him when his gestures became too aggressive.

Telling him you are married and you have to work doesn\u2019t exactly answer his question because he knows that married people sometimes cheat/divorce and having to work doesn\u2019t address the question.\n\nAdmittedly there\u2019s still a chance that might not have worked (in similar circumstances I was harassed for nearly 3 years by a colleague who, about a month after me setting a very clear boundary, famously came out with the phrase \u201cI thought you meant no kissing, cuddling or dating\u2026 I didn\u2019t think you was ending the relationship\u201d (like, dude\u2026 without those things, WHAT RELATIONSHIP?).

I told him about what happened, and he took it to his boss, and the guy was fired.

I won't say much because I don't want to dox myself, but helping people like Shawn keep their jobs and advocating for them is literally my job. Sean's autism does entitle him to certain reasonable accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, and many employers deal with this by allowing people with disabilities to get away with literally anything without repercussions or consequences. When they do that, they are actually doing a disservice, not only to the employee with disabilities, but for everyone in the entire workplace. Shawn's status as a disabled person does not exempt him from harassment policies, nor should it. You told him his behavior was inappropriate and you were not interested, and he continued to harass you. If he got a free pass and faced no consequences, he would have learned that his behavior was tacitly acceptable and continued. He needed to face the same consequences as any other employee would in that situation. And it is entirely unacceptable and unprofessional for his mother to come at you like that. I hope that Shawn gets the services he needs, but it's not your responsibility to provide for his wellbeing. \n\nI would urge you to educate yourself about Autism a little bit more, though. Describing Shawn's behavior as \"tantrums\" is pretty demeaning language.

A shameless and seemingly deliberately deceitful mischaracterization of what was actually said. \n\nYour argument, such as it is, is a mixture of shit you made up, projection and magical thinking.", "Seriously? I deemed all autistic men predators because I'm not tolerant of this bullshit boys will be boys attitude that endangers autistic girls? You're disgusting. I hope you never have to face the situation OP did, where your boundaries and consent are less than shit for a man who has decided he's entitled to you, your body and your love.", "Why are you bending over backwards to protect a sexual harasser", "It's not her job to manage.  \n\nAs someone who has experienced a full range of sexual harrassment, upto and including rape, fuck off.   The harrassers intentions are irrelevant to how it affects the target..   \n\nIf this person has not been taught about consent and harrassment, that sucks.   But it's HR's and his family/therapist's job to manage the situation, not the target of the harrassment.", "She did speak up and told him several times that she was married. Did you read the post? Or are you defending this behavior because you display it?", "Anyone who disagrees with my bizarre defense of sexual harrassment is ableist?\n\nI see. Thanks for explaining.\n\nAs for 'speaking up' maybe you should read the opening post again. OP spoke up, to him, every day for months.", "I'm someone who hangs out with alot of neuroatypical men (I have nerdy hobbies and employnebt) .   I also frequently don't wear my ring.  \"I'm married\" works very well.  People that don't respect that are typically neurotypucal douchebags.", "Dare I ask what they said?", "In a court of law, many cases have been thrown out if the intent to sexually harrass wasn't there.\n\nGiven this, applied to the op, it is obvious that the intent was not there.\n\nHe was, quite literally, obsessed with the op, which is what happens with NT people and they repeat and repeat the same behaviours.\n\nThis was, to that person, no different to lining up pens, or similar, simply a repetitive behaviour. They had no understanding of the social etiquette and certainly, no sexual intention, given that they simply spoke to her, never touched her or invaded her space or suggested otherwise.", "Do you not think that those you hang out with are Socially hifh performing men who are NT?\n\nI presume you realise that they are not a homogenous group?a\n\nWould you ever say similar about hanging out with a group of black people suggesting that they represent all POC? OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T!", "Being found legally incompetent due to a disability is possible.  \n\n However, it's not moral to allow a harrasser to have continued access to his target.   He needs intervention before returning to a workplace.", "It is not the burden of women to tolerate sexual harassment even when it comes from neurodivergent people. Your claims are disgusting and belittling to the ND community.", "There are plenty of autistic people here affirming that autism is not an excuse and that op did the right thing.   I'm OK with my stance", "And this could have been managed in a less ableist manner.\n\nIn a supportive manner.", "If she'd made herself so clear, then the situation may not have repeated. If she'd reacted and sought support for him this wouldn't have escalated.\n\nYou're right she didn't have to.\n\nAnd that makes her a crap colleague and human being.", "Nobody is obligated to be supportive towards their harasser. Stop.", "That's on HR to do the supporting or retraining if appropriate.   She has a legal right to report this sort of behavior.", "Keep victim blaming, that\u2019s really helping your narrative."]}
