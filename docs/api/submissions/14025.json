What was that punishment for?", "YTA- Like father like son\u2026.\n\nListen, if your son threw a tantrum by kicking the backseat of your car and cussing you out, than yes he should\u2019ve been punished. But I\u2019m left to wonder where he learned this behavior\u2026 OP you realize you threw a tantrum too right? You were sarcastic (and ironically) cussed at your brother to  leave. Then \u201cback talked\u201d your SIL after she expressed the arguing was making her uncomfortable. \n\nSometimes when children act out it\u2019s good to have a third party (like your brother) to talk with them and hopefully help them realize why those behaviors are wrong. This is why they say \u201cit take a village\u201d.\n\nI seriously cannot get passed the fact that your son cussed and was punished, but, you used THE BIG ONE, the Queen-Mother of the dirty words to tell your brother to get the F out. Reminds me of A Christmas Story and the \u201cO FUDGE scene\u201d with Ralphie saying he\u2019s heard that word from his dad a million times. \n\nOP I think you need to wash YOUR mouth out with Lifebouy Soap!", "Info: Was your son given dinner in his room? Was he allowed to eat with the family but chose not to?", "YTA and you SHOULD be kinder.", "Your 9 year old isn\u2019t the only one who had a meltdown today.\n\nYTA.\n\nYour brother stepped up and helped your child emotionally navigate a shitty situation and possibly helped him understand the situation and definitely treated him with more respect than you showed anyone today. \n\nDoes your wife get a day in punishment since they\u2019re her children too?", "Yta - you're sarcastic and rude. Of course it was awkward and of course they left. If you had issues with him staying up there, you should have told him no. Or that he needed to come back down.", "INFO: have you done anything to help your son learn HOW to regulate his emotions or do you just punish him?", "YTA, but not exclusively for the reasons you might think. You are the asshole for kicking your brother out for something as simple as that, especially in the way that you did - but that\u2019s not the only reason. \n\nPart of being a good parent is taking constructive criticism and being able to own up to being wrong or handling situations wrong. It\u2019s good that your son has an adult that will call you out, if he did it himself (son), He\u2019d probably be punished further. \n\nThe fact that someone showing your son compassion upset you so much is a HUGE red flag. If that\u2019s how you act / respond (anger, cursing at your brother, lashing out), it\u2019s no surprise that your son has picked up those traits. Looking in the mirror isn\u2019t so fun. \n\nYour brother was *right* too, and that\u2019s what really gets me. There are a PLETHORA of studies that show being kinder (not to be confused with a lack of punishment and structure) and taking the time to actually teach kids what they did wrong and how to do better yields better long term results.", "YTA. Kids need help with emotional regulation and you\u2019re clearly not in any position to teach anyone that.", "YTA. You don't know everything and you should learn how to take constructive criticism.  I don't think it's necessary to start a fight with your brother so you can prove a point to a 9 year old. Kindness goes a long way with children AND the rest of your family.", "NTA, i assume that if your brother come to your place just for diner it means he doesn't live far so it's not like your son don't see his uncle a lot. And your brother should have respected you on this. Him going to say hello and spend a bit of time with would have been ok, but him literraly spending the evening with your son is very rude to you and your other child. But at the same time, you should have told him to come back down and not lettinghim spend his evening with your son, so it's a bit on you too.", "YTA. Get yourself some therapy to learn how to handle conflict like an adult, and to learn how to effectively parent what seems to be a difficult child.", "YTA. You got offended and lashed out.", "YTA for not resolving this amicably. A kid who is grounded could spend time with his uncle and that made you mad.\n\nYou could be kinder like your brother said. But no, you choose not to. So be an AH \ud83d\ude04", "He copied your tantrums", "NTA\n\nYour brother should have respected your wishes as a parent. Barring abusive behavior, your parenting style should not be any of his business.\n\nI think that\u2019s the part your brother does not get, he thinks your parenting decisions are up for debate.\n\nI don\u2019t think you were wrong to tell him to leave. Maybe the F Bomb could have been kept out of it but honestly if someone was questioning my parenting, I\u2019d probably have a few choice words myself. Whenever you do talk again, I\u2019d probably tell him your decisions as a parent aren\u2019t up for discussion or debate.", "ESH, meaning you and your brother. You two need to figure out how to communicate without immediately getting hostile. Sarcasm has its place, but it escalated this situation unnecessarily. Think about setting a better example for your nine year old because I think I see where he learned to curse at the people he is supposed to love.", "I pretty much always say NTA when it comes to parenting. And sibling relationships are fucked 5 ways to Sunday, so no, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH. If your relationship with your brother is anything like mine, it\u2019ll blow over.", "I could see two extremes here, and anything between.\n\nAt one extreme, your kid might be a manipulative little pill, you have tried to be firm but he got on your last nerve, you grounded him but still weren't trying to be cruel and your childless brother just doesn't get it.  Your wife is a peacemaker and so just wants everyone to get along.\n\nAt the other, your kid is a supersensitive child and you're a yeller. Your wife and brother both see this and have tried to tell you this but you won't listen to them. \n\nWithout more information my inclination is N-T-A. But... you should sit down with your wife and ask sincerely if you were out of line. And if you can't do that...", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t invite family over if they can\u2019t see the whole family. It seems inevitable your brother would need to go upstairs to talk to Axel, when it could\u2019ve easily been, \u201cokay no screen time, come have dinner.\u201d Then there wouldn\u2019t have been this weird, private conversations fiasco. \n\nAnd that\u2019s where your brother crossed a line. He didn\u2019t respect your decision as a parent, and he ignored the rest of the party so he was also a poor guest. The grounding was/is totally warranted here.", "Nta your brother needs to mind his own business", "NTA. You could have been a bit more diplomatic with your brother, but I can understand your frustration with him second guessing and interfering with your parenting decisions. \n\nDoes your brother have any children of his own?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you don't like looking in the mirror then try changing. If you have this little control or even RECOGNITION of when you're emotions are getting the better of you then that's a pretty big red flag.

Your son is acting the way he is because YOU are his role model, and your post alone outlines that you can\u2019t control your anger, you lash out, and wildly overreact and exaggerate situations to make them worse. Like what is with \u201cbanishing\u201d your kid to their room, while being sent to your room has been proven to not even be an effective punishment, regardless of that the point isn\u2019t to exclude them from the family and try to get rid of them, it\u2019s to make them think about their actions and that they have consequences.
