I would encourage you to take the constructive criticism people here (because you did come here and invite this discussion), and from people who know and love you, as an opportunity to consider if there\u2019s a better way to address things than you currently are capable of addressing them.

I had a LOT of punishments like yours from one parent, the other parent tried more like your brother to talk to me about my feelings and why what I did was wrong and how to better express myself and we discussed the reasons for rules. Knowing the reason for a rule helped me follow it. For example, I hated wearing a seat belt because I didn\u2019t like the way it felt (sensory issues). If I was told \u201cput on your seat belt\u201d I would ask why and if I was told \u201cbecause I said so\u201d I would be SO upset. But if I was told \u201cI know it\u2019s uncomfortable but it\u2019s to stop you getting hurt if there\u2019s an accident\u201d I would do it because I was in a very serious accident when I was 2.

But not throwing a tantrum at a kid throwing a tantrum is important. Plus if you punish a kid by sending them to their room going and talking to them after giving them a little time to calm down should be part of the process of the punishment, the learning from the mistakes part. The part where you explain to them the rules and the reasons for them and give them a chance to tell you how they felt so you can validate their feelings in an appropriate way that will help them with their emotional regulation next time. And then you give them a chance to apologise and you hug it out and the kid can come down for dinner. Your brother did your job for you. And better than you.

This helps tremendously in avoiding spiking into affect which leads to loss of control of behavior, which happens. Even sometimes with this approach. It helps her be a participant in the situation instead of just a party things are happening to (so we have a feeling of control instead of a loss of it), and it shows you are not raring to fight.

That means practicing good self regulation in everyday life. \n\nAlso, it IS worth noting that kids DO do what do do and not what we say (well, rarely do they do what we say anyway), and when you model that an acceptable response to perceived disrespect is cursing and yelling- that is what you have modeled.

In fact, as a role model, the uncle seems way better than OP.  \n\nAnd yeah, the kid COULD have picked up the swearing elsewhere, but we have OP copping to using cussing as a management tool for his family, so there's that.   \n\nUnfortunately,  unless OP learns to manage his temper and mete out appropriate punishments, I see this kid escalating his behavior, not getting better.", "oh yeah sure the son learned this behaviour at school and not from his dad who literally did the exact same thing at even less provocation.sure.", "It\u2019s sushi so I\u2019m assuming it was ordered from somewhere else and not made by OP, therefore I\u2019m looking at it as take out. If I cussed my mom out while she was driving me and my brother to pick up a pizza or I guess in this case sushi, you can bet your ass only my brother would have gotten pizza that night, and I would have gotten a sandwich or something else made for me at home. \n\nOPs not teaching him, \u201cyou don\u2019t get to eat cause you\u2019re in trouble\u201d he\u2019s teaching him \u201cyou don\u2019t get a treat cause you\u2019re in trouble\u201d, and I see 0 problems with that. It\u2019s not like he fed him disgusting slop either.\n\nEdit // also the kid is not going to be hurt from malnutrition because he had a pb&j for dinner one night lmao", "It makes a decent struggle meal if you need it to, but its by no means a balanced meal for a kid. Especially if you\u2019re using commercial ingredients, and many people are, you\u2019re not getting much in the way of vitamins or minerals. Additionally, all of these ingredients are pretty high in sugar. \n\nUSAtoday did an [article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2021/10/25/peanut-butter-jelly-healthy-nutritionists-weigh-sandwich/6102633001/) with a few nutritionists weighing in on how to make the sandwich better, so objectively speaking there is, in fact, an issue with pb&j\u2019s nutritionally.", "Eating a meal that the rest of the family is eating and sharing it with them is not a reward for bad behavior. There\u2019s also no indication that this is a special meal, either.\n\nA single PBJ and juice is not enough. Clearly, the child was still hungry, as he ate some of his Uncle\u2019s food.", "Uhhh yeah, taking things away from kids does work, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re on about. It\u2019s a punishment, it\u2019s supposed to be a minorly unpleasant removal of something they like but don\u2019t need, like screen time. There\u2019s been a weird pendulum swing about punishment since \u201cgentle parenting\u201d is popular right now, sometimes a parent takes something away because the kid was bad, kid pouts, eventually everybody moves on.\n\nThis top comment just made up a narrative that half the comments are deciding to run with, I read this is a father who justifiably punished their son and then had their brother try to just undermine the punishment, not some brave brother defending an abused child.", "Out of curiosity, do you have kids?", "No. I am asking your opinion. Forget about this entire situation. You made the statement that taking away screen time is an inappropriate punishment for bad behavior. I asked you what would be an appropriate punishment? You have failed to give any answer. \nIt would seem that you do not feel that children should be held accountable for appropriate behavior.", "To me it doesn\u2019t matter how the tantrum started or why. It ended in his child swearing at him and kicking the back of his seat in protest. And I\u2019m dying to know where you\u2019re seeing that OP lost his temper at all. Nowhere does it say he yelled at anybody, not even at his kid.", "I wouldn\u2019t take kindly to someone trying to tell me how to parent my kid, either, and with OP\u2019s reaction I\u2019m guessing this probably isn\u2019t the first time brother has overstepped.", "Did you read what he wrote? His brother suggested to him to be kinder to his kid. Where did he undermine his punishment? Didn't even happen in front of his kid. \nA massive difference to what you are discribing.", "It's Reddit.", "That may be what he\u2019s trying to teach, but thats not what kids learn from punishments like this. What they learn is that, when they\u2019re bad, they dont deserve good food. That is a problem. That can and has led to people punishing themselves with food later in life when they feel bad about themselves. \n\nYour anecdotal evidence does not compare to the actual science we have on the subject, that says tying food in with punishments during childhood increases risk later in life for illnesses like anorexia, bulimia, and binge-eating. \n\nIn a world with 5000 different parenting options, why risk your childs health going this one route. Just get them a regular meal and parent a different way.", "I'm baffled by this, tbh. like if I was serving a kid, I'd include stuff like a fruit or veg on the side and probably another small side item but... a pb and j is a totally normal meal for a child. for adults, too. \n\nin recovery from anorexia, meal plans often suggest pb&js for meals. you have to add yogurt on the side and a fruit and milk, but its a pb&j. not every meal has to be jam packed full of vitamins and minerals, but meals do have to have the basic micronutrients to keep you alive: fat, protein, carbs, fiber.\n\nedit: the article you linked says as much, too. healthier than boxed mac n cheese.", "It has nothing to do with gentle parenting. When you reduce someone\u2019s autonomy, their natural instinct is to fight. Regardless of whether they are a child or a parent. There are other things you can do that aren\u2019t \u201cgentle parenting\u201d but that are not controlling the child. I\u2019m not saying let kids do whatever they want. They need guidance.\n\nSo how about we guide them on emotional regulation? How about putting the kid in time out and saying when YOU can chill out, then you can come back to the group as long as you behave. It makes the child search for control over their emotion and it allows them the reward of self moderating in order to be a functional part of the group.\nIsolating the child in their room is the WRONG response. It causes calm in the parent, but not in the child. The damage is done at this point because the kid is 9 and has already learned that controlling people\u2019s autonomy is the only way to get what you want out of them.", "\"No shit\" and \"get the fu(k out\"  \n\nYeah, OP has a problem with his anger management \n\nNow, as for the tantrum itself, it very much does matter.   If OP is arbitrarily making up things as he goes along, then the kid doesn't have any consistency to base his own behavior on.  \n\nLet me explain.  \n\nSay OP has had clear rules about screen time for at least several months.   Let's say 2 hours total time per day for arguments sake.   Now if the kid has gone over, then yeah, he should tell him \"hey, you've used up all your time for the day\"  if this rule has been enforced consistently for several months, a well regulated child will move on.   If the child balks or throws a tantrum, a consistent parent would have already laid out a punishment that would be in line for what the behavior was.  \n\nOn the other hand, if the kid is normally given free rein on the screens, and OP suddenly, and without explanation, takes the privilege away, then  even well regulated children would react badly.  For the 9 YO to cuss his dad out leads me to believe the dad falls into the inconsistent category.  On top of the anger issues.", "Maybe someone should give you advice on how to parent your kid if you think being grounded to your room for the ---entire day--- is just a time out and appropriate punishment, especially for a meltdown at 9 years old which happens to kids at that age. \n\nAn hour is a timeout. A few hours maybe also a timeout. But the ENTIRE DAY. Holy shit.", "Saying 'maybe be kinder' once isn't even telling you how to anything unless you have control issues. Mature adults are capable discussing this calmly, the brother hasn't been haranguing OP hes just being nice to a kid.", "He told him he wouldn't get screen time today. It's in the post.", "He tried to interfere with their parenting, first by rewarding them with spending the whole visit in their room, and later trying to \"correct\" the father\u00b4s parenting. Not every time a kid is punished is an instance of \"the father is doing a poor work\", sometimes there is nothing other than a child\u00b4s consequences of their actions. You give the benefit of the doubt to the kid but not the father? You can assume the dad didn\u00b4t communicate with their son but can\u00b4t assume the kid gave the uncle the puppy eyes? Regardless, uncle coming out and swinging on OP like he made their child a disservice is undermining their parent, maybe commenting what he said neutrally would be more effective or even accepted, but just coming like \"your son is upset, what are you gonna do about it?\" is pretty presumptuous and arrogant on their part", "I think it is fine for a lunch/snack.. if you\u2019re using good ingredients. I mean, at the end of the day that is really the determining factor. If you\u2019re using jam filled with real fruit, natural peanut butter, whole grain bread\u2026. With some sides that\u2019d be fine. But that not what most people do.\n\nIn this case, its being served with OJ. Commercially in the US that\u2019s generally made with orange paste, a ridiculous amount of sugar, water, and coloring. That would leave me hungry before breakfast, its not gonna be enough for a kid who needs between 1600 and 2200 calories a day.", "Massive L for the US, goddamn. I don't do well with excessive sugar, I start to feel sick. But pb sandwiches with banana in the UK got me feeling good.", "A meltdown that had the kid swearing and kicking the back of his father\u2019s seat. And it clearly wasn\u2019t an entire day? What? Kid\u2019s 9 years old, probably in school, and was grounded for the rest of the night as it so clearly states in the OP.", "I mean. It\u2019s wildly not unheard of that kids will complain to other family members when they\u2019ve been \u201cslighted\u201d by punishment for their actions. Grounding a kid is far from cruel.", "But why. The punishment for no screen time was for kicking the seat.  But what caused all of it. There is more to the story. What was the melt down about. Was it just because he was kicking the seat. And he wouldn\u2019t stop.", "This is wild to me. The whole point of banishing a child to their room is so they think about their actions, right? Its not just so they\u2019re misable alone. So if an adult goes up there, talks about the kids actions, and comes back down just to say to the parent that they could be kinder in the future.. that doesnt negate/undermine the punishment. \n\nThe child cannot swear and \u2018go off\u2019 on their parent; their parent could have handled the situation in a more kind way. These are not mutually exclusive statements.", "Is this a jail or a home you are talking about and even  in jail you get visiting rights.", "Yeah, I'm European so I thought it was so odd. Apparently \"wonder bread\" that's a common bread (just regular white bread that goes well in the toaster) tastes more like cake to us Europeans. We have much stricter rules on what's allowed in our food and I think a cap on how much sugar etc. Or at least in the EU, but you brits probably still have the same rules in effect, apart from bendy bananas maybe ;)"]}
