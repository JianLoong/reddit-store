What was that punishment for?", "YTA- Like father like son\u2026.\n\nListen, if your son threw a tantrum by kicking the backseat of your car and cussing you out, than yes he should\u2019ve been punished. But I\u2019m left to wonder where he learned this behavior\u2026 OP you realize you threw a tantrum too right? You were sarcastic (and ironically) cussed at your brother to  leave. Then \u201cback talked\u201d your SIL after she expressed the arguing was making her uncomfortable. \n\nSometimes when children act out it\u2019s good to have a third party (like your brother) to talk with them and hopefully help them realize why those behaviors are wrong. This is why they say \u201cit take a village\u201d.\n\nI seriously cannot get passed the fact that your son cussed and was punished, but, you used THE BIG ONE, the Queen-Mother of the dirty words to tell your brother to get the F out. Reminds me of A Christmas Story and the \u201cO FUDGE scene\u201d with Ralphie saying he\u2019s heard that word from his dad a million times. \n\nOP I think you need to wash YOUR mouth out with Lifebouy Soap!", "Info: Was your son given dinner in his room?

Of course it was awkward and of course they left. If you had issues with him staying up there, you should have told him no. Or that he needed to come back down.", "INFO: have you done anything to help your son learn HOW to regulate his emotions or do you just punish him?", "YTA, but not exclusively for the reasons you might think. You are the asshole for kicking your brother out for something as simple as that, especially in the way that you did - but that\u2019s not the only reason. \n\nPart of being a good parent is taking constructive criticism and being able to own up to being wrong or handling situations wrong. It\u2019s good that your son has an adult that will call you out, if he did it himself (son), He\u2019d probably be punished further. \n\nThe fact that someone showing your son compassion upset you so much is a HUGE red flag. If that\u2019s how you act / respond (anger, cursing at your brother, lashing out), it\u2019s no surprise that your son has picked up those traits. Looking in the mirror isn\u2019t so fun. \n\nYour brother was *right* too, and that\u2019s what really gets me. There are a PLETHORA of studies that show being kinder (not to be confused with a lack of punishment and structure) and taking the time to actually teach kids what they did wrong and how to do better yields better long term results.", "YTA. Kids need help with emotional regulation and you\u2019re clearly not in any position to teach anyone that.", "YTA. You don't know everything and you should learn how to take constructive criticism.  I don't think it's necessary to start a fight with your brother so you can prove a point to a 9 year old. Kindness goes a long way with children AND the rest of your family.", "NTA, i assume that if your brother come to your place just for diner it means he doesn't live far so it's not like your son don't see his uncle a lot. And your brother should have respected you on this. Him going to say hello and spend a bit of time with would have been ok, but him literraly spending the evening with your son is very rude to you and your other child.

Barring abusive behavior, your parenting style should not be any of his business.\n\nI think that\u2019s the part your brother does not get, he thinks your parenting decisions are up for debate.\n\nI don\u2019t think you were wrong to tell him to leave. Maybe the F Bomb could have been kept out of it but honestly if someone was questioning my parenting, I\u2019d probably have a few choice words myself. Whenever you do talk again, I\u2019d probably tell him your decisions as a parent aren\u2019t up for discussion or debate.", "ESH, meaning you and your brother. You two need to figure out how to communicate without immediately getting hostile. Sarcasm has its place, but it escalated this situation unnecessarily.

Your wife is a peacemaker and so just wants everyone to get along.\n\nAt the other, your kid is a supersensitive child and you're a yeller. Your wife and brother both see this and have tried to tell you this but you won't listen to them. \n\nWithout more information my inclination is N-T-A. But... you should sit down with your wife and ask sincerely if you were out of line. And if you can't do that...", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t invite family over if they can\u2019t see the whole family.
