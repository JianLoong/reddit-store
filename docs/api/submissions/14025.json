But I\u2019m left to wonder where he learned this behavior\u2026 OP you realize you threw a tantrum too right? You were sarcastic (and ironically) cussed at your brother to  leave. Then \u201cback talked\u201d your SIL after she expressed the arguing was making her uncomfortable. \n\nSometimes when children act out it\u2019s good to have a third party (like your brother) to talk with them and hopefully help them realize why those behaviors are wrong. This is why they say \u201cit take a village\u201d.\n\nI seriously cannot get passed the fact that your son cussed and was punished, but, you used THE BIG ONE, the Queen-Mother of the dirty words to tell your brother to get the F out.

It\u2019s good that your son has an adult that will call you out, if he did it himself (son), He\u2019d probably be punished further. \n\nThe fact that someone showing your son compassion upset you so much is a HUGE red flag.
