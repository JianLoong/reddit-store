If you snuck your cat in the house and it killed his bird, that would be bad. Grief doesn\u2019t get better with expensive presents. This guy is being a manipulative d-bag.

I know it upsets you when people suggest that you are some sort of victim in this relationship, or that 3 years isn't a long time. Three years is a long time when it is approximately 1/6 of your entire life. When you are his age (27), 3 years is 1/9 of your entire life. And when you are in your forties, 3 years when you were 16-19 will just be a distant and hazy blip in time. \n\nI encourage you to take a break from the relationship. You don't necessarily need to date anyone else. In fact I think not dating for a bit might be good for you. If your boyfriend won't agree to a brief break, you'll have more clues about whether he and his family thinks of you as a truly equal partner. Clearly they are not currently treating you like one. I'm not sure how/why you think you will be able to control/change this going forward.", "NTA, and sweetie? Please stay with your mother.\n\nI don't shame age gaps - my wife is twelve years older than me. But I was 25 when we started dating, a full on adult living by myself with a job and a cat. And I'm sure there are people who would argue that our age gap is too much, but I digress. It is *not normal* for someone in their mid-twenties to date a teenager. I can't imagine at that age looking at a 16 year old and thinking, \"Yeah, I'd date that.\" Why couldn't he get a girl his own age? Why was a *sixteen* year old on his radar at all? Nothing about it is normal.\n\nThree years is a lot, but it's not the end of the world. You have an out right now. Don't go back. Or go back with a friend if you left stuff there.

He is behaving like this because he knows you are too young and inexperienced to know that this is manipulating and controlling behaviour.

Adults date teens for two reasons. One is that they are sex predators. The second is because they can mold a teen mind any way they want because they are too young and too inexperienced to have formed strong opinions on anything on their own.

You're 19 now, which is still a child. Look at any 16yo boy. Even to you, that must look like a young child. And you're only 3 years older! Now imagine where you will be at in another 5 years. You will have changed so much, you will be an adult, with adult wants and needs, responsibilities and you will look at 19 year olds as \"kids\". A 16 year old will look like a toddler to you. Why would you be attracted to a toddler? They are easily manipulated because they lack experience. Even the smartest of toddlers can be convinced that Santa brought them those presents. And even the most mature 16 year old girl can be convinced that that guy really really loves her. I'm so sorry, because I KNOW how you feel. I've been there. And I wouldn't believe it either.

A 3 year relationship is nothing.", "This man is with someone so young because when an accident that is no one's fault like this one happens he can bully and gaslight you into thinking it's your fault and get you to go above and beyond for him as an apology, let me ask you, how many friends do you have that are just your friends and not his, how often do you see your family and do you have to get his permission to do so?", "Watch Centaurworld.\n\nThat is not love. Love is him forgiving you for something that was an accident. Love is not a 23 yo dating someone who is still a child. Teenager, yes. But still a child. The life experience differs hugely. That is why people are worried.\n\nGrooming, abuse, it's not easy to see when you think you're in love. But this man does not love you. Love is not demanding expensive gifts. Love is not ignoring a very clear social boundary of the fact that grown men do not date teenage children.\n\nHe probably will tell you he loves you. Does whatever he can to prove it. Knows exactly what to say to hurt you just as much as he makes you happy. That's manipulation. Love is not using someone's hurt or pain against them. Manipulation will use everything they can to control the person.\n\nStat at your moms and break up with him to test him.   He'll come crawling back saying he loves you and he will demand things of you. He will rage and be furious that how dare you.", "This!! OP you are easier to manipulate and control. Buying him an expensive gift for Christmas because his bird died is ridiculous and manipulative. Even if you bought him something expensive it doesn\u2019t mean things between you two are magically going to be perfectly fine again!  I\u2019d definitely step back and take a hard look at how your relationship with him as been while you\u2019re staying at your mom\u2019s!! You can do better!", "OP, please read this very well written comment and really think about it.", "I said the same but you asked what she could be blamed for logically i said what i think the family and bf could say but i agree with you . And actually said something very similar in my comment where i voted"]}
