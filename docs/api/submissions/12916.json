It was a 2 minute conversation as I was bringing her to school and the mom side of me was thinking more of the fact that the mom wanted A to earn the money.  Having never met the mom or A I didn\u2019t want my first impression from her to be that I\u2019m an overstepper. I could have cared less about the $4. \n\nI took the advice of many and emailed the teacher offering to anonymously pay for any child in Q\u2019s class that couldn\u2019t go if money was an issue. She replied quickly and told me that no child would be denied the trip if they couldn\u2019t afford it. \n\nI have a feeling that this very young 23 year old teacher may be taking some money from her own pocket so I\u2019m heading to the store after Q gets home to buy classroom staples that she is probably low on. \n\nFirst time poster here so hope I\u2019m following the rules. \ud83e\udd1e\n\nMy 4th grade daughter Q (10) has a heart of gold which I most days absolutely love. She asks me as I\u2019m driving her to school if she can have $4. I then asked her if she needed snack money and she said no she has a friend A (10 year old girl) who needs it for their field trip next week and this is the last day to hand it in.\n\nI told her that was very nice but I\u2019m sure her parents would pay for it if she was allowed to go. A told Q that her mom is a nurse and is gone before she wakes up. I pointed out that she must see her at other times during the day. Q responds that A\u2019s mom told her that she needed to earn the money herself if she wants to go. \n\nMy heart strings were pulled and I almost handed it to her because it\u2019s only $4 but then rethought it. This girl is new to town and I have never met her or her mom. I want my daughter to be someone who helps those in need but I also don\u2019t want her to be taken advantage of and always giving to those who have the means.\n\nI realize you never know someone\u2019s actual situation but I\u2019m erring on the side of \u201cthe mom has the money but doesn\u2019t just want to give it without teaching her daughter that life isn\u2019t always going to give you what you want for free\u201d.", "created_utc": 1679493676, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yk06w/aita_for_not_giving_my_kid_4_to_pay_for_another/", "score": 1896, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If what the other kid told your daughter is true, then the other mom\u2019s attitude towards her 10 year old kid is kind of troubling and it might be a good idea to quietly find out if the mom really is expecting her 10 year old to finance her school trips on her own. I\u2019m not necessarily saying the other mom is evil, she might just be low income or something but $4 really isn\u2019t a lot of money and it\u2019s her alleged attitude that\u2019s most unsettling. I\u2019d leave it to the school to decide if they want to involve the other mother directly but the situation as relayed to your daughter (the mom is never around and refuses to give her young child $4 for a field trip) sounds like it might warrant some further action.", "NAH\n\nJust let the teacher know you are willing to contribute to any student who cannot afford the trip and give a heads up about what your daughter asked.", "NAH\u2026That\u2019s a tough one but maybe you could ask the teacher? I am secretly paying for another child to go on a class field trip because their mom can\u2019t afford the $20.", "NAH - but as a parent I would have given the $4. You have to remember the info you\u2019re getting is filtered through a 10 yr old brain, who got the info from another 10 yr old brain. Point being a lot of facts could have been misunderstood or left out. I would have erred on the side of \u201cgive the kid 4 bucks to go on the field trip\u201d especially if they\u2019re new in town anyways and maybe the mom didn\u2019t fully understand what was going on with the field trip (from experience being the new parent at a school sometimes it\u2019s hard to stay caught up with how schools communicate to parents, not all schools are great communicators unfortunately).", "NTA, send the teacher an email and cover the $4 anonymously if A\u2019s family is in financial distress.", "So... you would give your daughter 4 $ for chocolate but not for another child? And you try to teach her to help others? I'm an adult and I honestly don't get it.\n\n\nIn my mind you sbould have some kind of budget in mind for extras for your kid if they don't get an allowance (yet) and let them have some say about how they want to spend it. \n\n\nI feel you blow this 4 completly out of proportion, taught your daughter helping other is actually bad and you don't have a say in your life. \n\n\nSaying no was fine but as I say I really don't get your reasoning.\n\n\nYTA", "NTA. Because you are correct: you don't want to mess with another parent's parenting decisions.   \n\n\nHowever, if you are fortunate enough that $4 is no big deal, why not give your daughter an extra $4 to give to the teacher? She can put the money in an envelope with a note saying expressly that this money is for anyone who cannot pay. That way, her friend can go on the trip and not feel like she's a charity case. And if it happens that the friend's mom really can't afford four bucks, the child can go anyways.   \n\n\nMost schools these days have funds for things like this. The teachers generally know which kids are in need and which kids might be having a life lesson on being thrifty.", "NAH You shouldn't overstep that student's parent's decision. But the reply from her mother sounds like it could be due to a tight budget. You should chat with the teacher to check if the other student is not able to afford things and if you could help in the future.", "NTA.\n\nWhile I absolutely would be willing to pay the money, the issue is the permission from the parent - you can't overstep there.\n\nIf you would like to help, contact the teacher and ask if there were any kids who could not go due to money issues and offer to help that way. I've actually done this (I was friends with the teacher outside of school and she had brought up how bad she felt about some kids not being able to go, so I was able to give her the money since she was able to get parents' permission). I would not have left this to my child to do anything, as wonderful as she is I am certain she doesn't know the full story.", "I don't think you're the asshole but you could have contacted the teacher and asked for clarification.", "NTA\nAs you said you don't really know the situation. Since this isn't a matter of safety, not your business.", "I\u2019m really shocked at all of the Y T A posts.  First of all it\u2019s a 10 year old giving information to another 10 year old who is then giving it to their parent.  \n\nOP is definitely NTA without knowing what is actually going on.  The \u201cearn the money\u201d could be a simple as pick up your toys.  Asking the teacher is the best way to go about donating to help other students.  People can\u2019t just over rule other kids parents especially if they don\u2019t know them.  \n\nActing like the OP has flawed logic between giving her kid $4 for snacks but not a field trip that requires parental consent is just ignorant.  There is a huge difference between giving your kid extra money for snacks to share with kids whose parents can\u2019t afford to do that and over riding another parents decision.", "NTA. The burden for funding this child\u2019s field trip should not fall on the hopes a random parent pays. If you paid this time, the issue goes unaddressed and what happens if no one steps up next time?  Schools have funds to help cover field trip expenses for families that are not able to pay. You covering the cost of the trip does not help solve the bigger problem.", "NTA. It's your money and you can decide what to do with it, and you don't know the situation well enough to determine if you should be giving A the money. Even if you did, I feel like you would want to clear it with the mom first rather than having Q just give A the money", "NTA. \n\nHonestly, this isn't a situation for you to get involved in.  You don't know what is going on at that home, and its not really your place to decide that someone else's child should go on the trip.   Maybe the girl is refusing to do her chores and that is why the parent isn't paying.  \n\nAlso, I can say as a former teacher, there is a good chance that if its just a matter of a day or 2, that the kid would still be able to go on the trip.  \n\nAlso, paying for it doesn't matter if there is no permission slip signed, so the mom still has to get involved anyway .", "NTA you need more info, the kid could just be taking advantage of op daughter. The other parent may not want the kid to go or the kids grounded and not allowed. Maybe the other parent wants the kid to do chores to earn it as a life lesson that you need to work for what you want.  There's a lot that could be going on here that could explain it.\n\nThe other parent could get mad if you did without asking. At my son's school you need permission slips aswel as the payments (UK school). So just giving the money could be pointless anyway. \n\nNTA get more info and decide from there.", "NTA. Assuming your daughter is telling the truth, this is a matter between A and her mom. And while I agree it is wrong to make a 4th grade child pay for a field trip, it is the parents decision and OP is wise not to interfere with that. If the mom finds out, she may not allow A to go on the trip.\n\nI would contact the teacher and tell them what your daughter told you. Then say you\u2019re willing to send in $4 for A. See what the teacher says.", "NTA. Your daughter is so sweet. Maybe Q's mother is trying to teach her some lesson or she is getting punished for something she did, it's not right for you to step in unless the child is unsafe or anything.", "YTA!!!  Heartless!!!  My kid even hints that someone in their class is in need I'm on the phone with the teacher asking what needs to be done.  \nYour kid had a heart of gold, you now tarnished it!!", "YTA. It was $4. Now this child will be singled out as not being able to go. If you can afford why hold back? Are you worried about being scammed out of four whole dollars?", "NTA. Helping out others in need is great, being taken advantage of is not. You don't know what's going on here. Maybe inform the teacher if you trust them to handle the situation professionally. My school offers help to students whose parents cannot afford some school activities. Yet $4 is an amount a nurse should be able to handle without difficulty.\n\nEDIT: I overlooked this information: \"Q responds that A\u2019s mom told her that she needed to earn the money herself if she wants to go.\"\n\nWhy don't you give A the money in return to do some chores for you? Then she has earned the money for herself.", "ESH - her mom is definitely an a-hole for making her child work for an educational trip as a child. It's kind of sucky to put your child in a position where she's questioning her own good heart. If you're feeling charitable, something you could do is send extra money in an envelope to the teacher and say you'd like her to use it to cover the cost of the field trip for any students who don't have the money, then leave it up to the teacher to get permission from the parents for their children to attend.", "YTA.  I don't think the issue is what the other mom was trying to teach her child, it's what you were teaching yours about charity and compassion.", "Soft YTA.   \n\n\nIf I can afford something but am not sure of the truth of the other person's story, I will always choose to get taken advantage of. I can't control other people, but I can control myself. So, if they took advantage of me, too bad, that's on them. If they didn't, and they really needed the money, then I'm glad I didn't hesitate to help.   \n\n\n(Plus, if your daughter had the $4, she could have brought it back if the other kid either already had the money, or didn't have her parent's permission to go. Also, the $4 could have been paid back if the mom did have the means to pay.)", "ESH. It's the last day to turn in $. How is a 10-year-old going to earn that money if the mom is never around?  All you've done is ensure that the new kid in school is unable to attend the fiend trip.  Over $4.\n\nI get not wanting to overstep another parents' rules, but maybe this isn't the hill to die on.", "Being a person who probably puts too much energy into others I\u2019d say YTA. But it\u2019s your money and your choice and the way you raise your daughter is also your choice. If you didn\u2019t want to give $4 because it was the last day and maybe deal with the lesson part later that week (since the trip wasn\u2019t for another week) that\u2019s really up to you and no one else. Personally I would have paid it, especially since the girl was new, probably not made any friends and at the very least made a friend in your daughter, and either reached out to her mother the next day or met her while dropping your daughter off. It just makes me sad that because her mom isn\u2019t an attentive parent, she will miss out on a field trip she obviously wanted to go on. NTA became you aren\u2019t obligated to pay for another kid that\u2019s not yours.", "NAH I think it\u2019s a good call. They\u2019re 10 years old. There might have been some broken communication from the girls mother -> girl -> your daughter -> you. The mother may have had a good reason for not wanting her to go on the field trip and you giving it to her could seem like undermining her parenting. If you knew them a bit better then maybe it would be okay but the fact that she\u2019s new and a stranger to you makes it tricky.", "YTA. You're willing to give your kid $4 for snacks but not so another child can go on a field trip? I'm glad my parents were generous and taught me to help others.", "Well, you're not an AH. I mean, your money, your choice.\n\nHowever... 2 things stuck out to me. First:\n\n>A told Q that her mom is a nurse and is gone before she wakes up. I pointed out that she must see her at other times during the day. Q responds that A\u2019s mom told her that she needed to earn the money herself if she wants to go.\n\nI'm reading this as single parent working long shifts... likely new to the field and struggling. I'd assume it's financial need here.\n\n>I\u2019m erring on the side of \u201cthe mom has the money but doesn\u2019t just want to give it without teaching\n\n>Apparently the permission slip was already handed in and signed \n\nIf the parent signed the permission slip, why would you assume it's that they didn't want the child to go?\n\nI'd likely have told my child that I could give the money to the teacher to cover costs for any kiddos who couldn't afford it, as some of the other replies have suggested.\n\nSecond:\n\n>She asks me as I\u2019m driving her to school if she can have $4. I then asked her if she needed snack money \n\nYou were willing to give your 10 year old $4. 10 is... a testing ground. It's the start of or precursor to adolescence, and is an important time for exploring independence, and making our own choices. This is the age where, I feel, if your child is generally responsible, well-behaved, thoughtful, and not too terribly entitled... where I'd start giving them the freedom to make bad decisions (in a safe way) and to learn from them.\n\nI'd likely have given my 10 year old the $4 and explained my concerns. \"Sometimes people say they are in need, but they aren't. It might be a better choice to give the money to the teacher and...\" etc. Let her know what might happen if the other child is taking advantage. \"If she asks you again, that might mean...\" and so on. And praise her willingness to help those in need. That's an amazing trait to have at any age, but especially admirable in a 10 year old!\n\nThat said... there's no \"one right way\" to parent, and what I would do might not work for your family. You've no obligation to pay for another family, and you have a right to teach your child the lessons *you* think she needs to learn.\n\nYou can't be the AH in this situation, and I don't think either the children or the other parent have done anything wrong. So... going with NAH", "Yta I guess your daughters gets her compassion from her dad. Your daughter knows her classmates situation more than you.  She wanted to help the new girl be able to come on a fun trip.  She wanted to help the new girl fit in and not stand out.\n\nYou had the $4. You were fine giving it to her for snacks.\n\nYou could have went in and talked with the teacher. Or given it to your daughter and told her to give it directly to her teacher and say 'this is for anyone who wasn't able to bring it in today'.", "NTA because obviously there would need to be a permission slip to accompany the money.\n\n**BUT**  you\u2019re a giant ah for how you set out this scenario.\n\nYou\u2019d give your kind $4 for snack, but not a friend?? That\u2019s a very weird perspective to have when giving.\n\nYou seem skeptical of a 10yo which is also super weird.. if you\u2019re teaching your daughter boundaries to accompany her big heart, then why are you so concerned about this situation?\n\nIf the four dollars would radically change your life then I have understanding, but it also just seems like you didn\u2019t really want your kid to help. Which is fine, but just say that. Don\u2019t try to frame it as ***\u2019oh my kid is so lovely that this little monster I don\u2019t know might be taking advantage of her.***", "Just because she\u2019s a nurse doesn\u2019t mean she has the money.

Your daughter doesn\u2019t want her friend to miss out, and it doesn\u2019t sound like the child isn\u2019t allowed to, but that mom doesn\u2019t have the money. It\u2019s only $4 and it\u2019s allowing your daughter an act of kindness.  I personally just paid $70 for a friends kid to go on a field trip she couldn\u2019t afford to send her on, without hesitation. Could I have used that money elsewhere, absolutely but knowing that she isn\u2019t going to miss an opportunity because of me was well worth it.

The form also gave money, date, time, and travel details for information/planning purposes for requesting days off and financial planning. \n\n2- A notice was sent out as a reminder every few days when the fee would be due. On that reminder, I include an option to volunteer to send in an extra admission fee to be set aside for anyone who needed it. Several families would send it in. I kept track of who did and how much. \n\n3- On trip day, anyone who has permission but no money or lunch is covered by extra funds. Any unused funds are offered to be returned. Most parents would ask us to hold on to it for ice cream treat days or something else kids need money for. If I didn\u2019t have enough spare funds to cover everyone, I paid myself. No kid is left behind because of money. \n\nYour daughter was super sweet to want to help. I love that! I also love how you contacted the teacher directly to help anyone who needed it.

If that had been the situation I would have done the same. You sound like an amazing person to have overcome that. You took a terrible situation and forged ahead with some help from a friend. You sound like an incredible human being.", "Thank you. \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97", "Thank you \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97", "This was partially (or mostly) paid by the PTO. Each grade has a budget and if they go over the students pay out of pocket.", "She really is \ud83d\udc97", "That\u2019s a wonderful thing to do and will remember that in the future.", "Since she is brand new to the school I have no idea if it\u2019s something that has happened in the past. I will always send extra food or snacks if my kids say so and so only gets X, Y & Z every day. (Yes that\u2019s happened).\n\nI will keep an eye out and also told my daughter that if she feels bad about a situation she can always talk to me about it and we\u2019ll figure it out. I just need more time to process than when I\u2019m going through the drop off line. \ud83d\ude2c", "This trip was mostly funded by the PTO and the $4 was to offset the cost. I was actually president of it when my oldest ones were in this school. If the PTO has the ability to they can cover the cost but working so closely with the teachers over the years it almost always came from the teachers or a well meaning teacher. \n\nThankfully this teacher sends out a list each month saying what communal items they are running low on. So a case of Puffs and a ton of glue sticks were purchased from BJ\u2019s tonight. \n\nI appreciate your advice. \ud83d\ude0a", "Thankfully she will be going. \ud83d\ude0d", "Thank you for getting it\u2026this is 100% where my conflict lied. If the mom is trying to teach her daughter something, anything! Whether it be the value of money, learning that she needs to do a task in order to get a reward or whatever I did not in that moment or now feel that was my place to say screw the mom here Q give the money to A.", "Same here, I just send the teacher $50 Amazon cards several times a year", "In my class there was a standing offer for field trips that parents could send extra money, and that money would be added to help cover students who couldn't afford to pay, with priority going to the paying student's classmates.  So parents would just write a note in the envelope whether they wanted change or to donate the extra.", "Does it matter?", "Oh, ok. Thanks. \ud83d\udc4d", "Yes, and sometimes our children they are too young to understand that everybody parents different so to your daughter it might seem like you\u2019re just saying no and being selfish but really, you\u2019re just trying not to overstep boundaries as a parent because you wouldn\u2019t want them to go behind your back about something you explicitly told your daughter she had to do.", "This is an AMAZING idea. That way, families don\u2019t even have to ask if there\u2019s funding or feel like charity cases; everyone basically pays what they can to the pta and it\u2019s done. I\u2019m going to remember this when my child is school aged and suggest it!", "Absolutely it does\u2026I emailed the teacher after I posted offering to pay for any child who couldn\u2019t afford to go\u2026.yes I would give my child $4 for a snack at lunchtime since she rarely asks and one item alone is $2\u2026giving $4 to a child to pay for something that HER mother wanted her to earn on her own conflicted me\u2026not the $4 \u2026 the money was irrelevant it was about possibly going against the wishes of a mother I had never met.", "Absolutely. Thank you for understanding. \ud83d\ude0a", "> I always had to be the one to put food back too if we couldn't afford everything. \n\nThis is why I compulsively triple check my available funds before any kind of shopping.", "Me too. It sucks but I appreciate my mom\u2019s struggles so much.", "Yep.  Mine did too, similar time frame.  Though at least the kids left behind got to watch movies or do something else at least mildly fun.\n\nGranted my school wasn\u2019t affluent - we had few field trips and the school itself definitely couldn\u2019t cover sending kids who couldn\u2019t pay for whatever the activity was.", "same."]}
