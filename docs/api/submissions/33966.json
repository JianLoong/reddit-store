Honestly no idea. It's weird. I don't think it is committing a crime. They are not marrying so not breaking an incest marriage law. They can't naturally concieve children.

If no children can ever naturally come from the union the reason for the law is not there. So does that mean the reason for the conviction is not there. If biological children can never come from the union. That's why I'm confused i guess.", "I've always said it..
