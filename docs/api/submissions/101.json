I'm going to take a punt and say that the cashier, like most cashiers, was probably bored to sobs and not interested in anything your mum was saying. So there was really no need for you to say anything. You could've maybe raised the subject later and say that it wasn't very nice of her to try and put everything on you but calmly and sensibly.\n\nYour mum sounds a bit petulant though and if she really doesn't have any idea how much of the spending was hers, she needs to be more aware of her spending. If she had an issue with the items you were getting (which I assume she paid for), why get to the checkout and then b\\*tch about it? Why not keep an eye on things as she goes along?

She was lying to the cashier to make herself feel better about spending so much. You didn't need to take it personally, though it's understandable that you did since she was scapegoating you. \n\nI don't know your age, but you know you're right that she was using you as an excuse for her lack of self-control in buying things. I guess you just have to decide if it was worth it to you to rub her nose in it.", "NTA for being irritated that your mom made you the butt of a joke with a stranger, but YTA for picking a fight. Parents do annoying crap like this, it's unfortunate but starting a massive argument isn't going to make her stop. Next time she'll just have more ammunition to use against you. Now she can not only say you cost her a lot of money, she can also say you're ungrateful and disrespectful. I know it's awful to be treated this way, but you've got to learn to pick your battles.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
