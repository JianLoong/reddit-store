And no, just tossing cash at him won't fix a thing. But not that this is out of the way, it is up to you if you want to try to help him. And by that I mean help him learn how to manage things like his checking account, credit card, etc.   \n\n\nA financial management trick my father taught me was to write down, on a card or notepad, everything he spent money on. Buy a coffee, write it down, purchase school books, record that, grab beers with your buddies, and so on. My Dad started to do that once when he was pretty broke. He said the amazing thing is that once he was writing all of his expenses down it became clear how quickly he could spend money. Then the list let him look back to see what he spent each week or month, to find ways to cut costs. Then as he made adjustments he could see what worked and what didn't. Dad also made conscious choices to do low cost or free activities rather than ones that cost $$$, like meeting friends to hang out in a park instead of a bar, doing a potluck dinner rather than going out, etc.   \n\n\n The other thing your son needs to learn is to NOT use the credit card except in extreme cases.  Use cash or a Debit card or payment app tied to his checking. That way he is less likely to run up more debt. Now there will be times that he has to use the card, like if he needs textbooks and his next paycheck is a few days or a week away. But that literally is all that card should be for.   \n\n\nSo sit him down and talk about his monthly budget, both personal expenses, school fees and books, etc. Then work out a plan for how he will manage those expenses on the income he has. At first this will hurt, but at 19 he needs to learn these lessons now or he's going to be buried in debt and never get out of it.", "NTA. He\u2019s doing it on purpose.

Customer (son) presents a heavily edited case to manager (grandparents) who believe this and take it at face value.  They see a simple one-time error and an employee (daughter/DIL) who is being harsh/unfair etc.  Manager (grandparents) immediately grant request and offer sympathy.  Manager (grandparents) then remonstrate with employee (daughter/DIL)\n\nAt work you deal with this by keeping notes and, if appropriate, keeping manager in the loop.\n\nAt home you can only do this after the fact.  You can only do as you did here and explain the previous multiple abuses before you had to finally say no.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to have a sit down with the grandparents and agree a strategy for moving forward.\n\nI had this happen at work.  Customer repeated the behavior until the manager cut them off, escalated to higher management - rinse and repeat, then to a director who got them to \u2018promise\u2019 to not screw us over if he helped them  \u2018one more time\u2019. Customer screwed him for a HUGE amount of money.  If the escalation had been dealt with properly everyone would\u2019ve been happy, even the customer eventually.\n\nWho would he go to if the grandparents said no?

I learned what I needed to so I wouldn't screw up as often.\n\nI didn't hear OP say her son also has intellectual disability.  So what's a 19 year old's excuse for blasting past his bank account balance and refusing to hold himself accountable like an adult?", "There is nothing to learn about credit card debt.

Cause that's a neurological problem at that point.", "Absolutely calling it laziness is unfair and counterproductive when there is another reason, but laziness seems more likely, so being too hesitant to say that is its own problem.", "What you're saying is often very true, IDK people are downvoting you.", "Yep. The important thing is that you keep trying. You should be super proud of yourself!", "I don't think you/we are alone in that.\n\nI think our next major debt crisis in the U.S. will happen in a year or so.  Probably not until after the 2024 election cycle.  But inflation and interest rates are decimating a lot of Americans.", "I mean maybe 2 years ago. I\u2019d say it has to be at least a decade since I\u2019ve heard of anyone referring to budgeting as \u201cbalancing a checkbook\u201d.", "Consequences aren't negative reinforcement, living consequence free is unhealthy.

But thats it, no punishment my dear baby!\n\n\"Positive reinforcement only\" only works with pets, not with children.", "Hi I\u2019ve worked with autistic kids in the school system for 10 years and am AuDHD myself. The comment about the \u2018severe\u2019 end of the spectrum was abeblist. It is a spectrum disorder meaning that there are VASTLY different areas (like seriously there\u2019s around 20) where support needs may be needed. It\u2019s not a binary from \u2018mild to severe\u2019. Some people need heavy support in one area where another with the same disorder doesn\u2019t, and may need no support in another area. Someone may be able to drive a car, have a full time job, get a college degree, but has issues keeping their room clean or balancing their bank account, and have severe noise sensitivity that causes meltdowns or burnout.\n\nFor example they used to label all non verbal kids as \u2018severe and intellectually disabled\u2019 when now we know non verbal people can live perfectly independently with text to speech programs or ASL, and it\u2019s actually another area where they need support that keeps them from being independent.", "Because systems in current society are not designed with ND individuals in mind. The skillset needed to do many things varies greatly, and generalizing someone's (possibly) underdiagnosed or undiagnosed son at the start of adulthood is basically saying society and systems/structures within society and adulthood don't need to be examined... \n\nPut it this way, it's the equivalent of saying we should blame the 19 y/o for being legally blind and going into the red on his checking account because the bank doesn't B/LV features to manage his account. You wouldn't expect him to just \"Google how to see account balance,\" would you?\n\nIn the past 6 years, neuroscience and psychology are finding out more and more that SO MANY problems for people is that they are a square peg in a round hole. When you dig down deep into it, the hole needs to change to fit all shaped pegs.", "That\u2019s simply not true. There are some skills that need to be taught by someone and practiced over and over again to learn them. And not all autistic people struggle with the same things. It\u2019s not as black and white as you think.\n\nMy mom never taught me how to keep a house clean. She yelled at me to do chores and clean but never taught me the skills to maintain an area so it didn\u2019t become an insurmountable task for me to clean it. I knew how to scrub the bathroom with a toothbrush but I never learned how to maintain a room or house so it wasn\u2019t a huge task that felt impossible. I tried my entire life to do this and couldn\u2019t, until a friend was kind enough to go through my mess of a room with me and take the time to teach me what I didn\u2019t know. I now no longer struggle to maintain a clean area. Like at all.", "Ah, the jaded boomer purposefully misinterprets something to make their point. \n\nHow shocking", "He\u2019s literally complaining about the specific skills that he didn\u2019t pick up, and doing so in the most confrontational way possible. If he\u2019d reached out by asking for help it probably would have gone differently, but opening with \u201cyou didn\u2019t prepare me for this, so now you\u2019re on the hook for an open-ended amount of time\u201d is Bull.", "I graduated in 2010 and they taught us how to balance check books in a class but tbh I never did. Bc even then I could log into the website and check my balance and they kept a list of transactions I made. So there was no reason to. I haven\u2019t even written a check in 10 years at this point, the only places that take one where I live are places where you would make large purchases, like at a dealership.", "Executive functional skills are:\n\nPlanning\n\nworking memory\n\norganization\n\nemotional control\n\ninhibition\n\nmanage time\n\nmemorizing", "motor skills are often things autistics have issues with", "Yeah I keep track of bank transactions in a spreadsheet that's metaphorically a checkbook like eating with \"silver\"ware which is actually steel.

He\u2019ll have to learn to deal with his own issues with or without blaming OP.\n\nTough love sometimes is needed instead of bailing someone who\u2019s old enough to vote.", "That\u2019s also not true. There\u2019s a difference between motivation and your fight or flight system being activated. If you have ADHD and the fear of consequences is what works for you, it\u2019s because your executive functioning skills are not working and your fight or flight over takes that and makes you do the task anyway. This is not healthy.", "Thank you for this. I too work in education (the technical side), and am AuDHD. I was trying to put it into words, but was struggling.", "Lol, OP's son is not even diagnosed with anything. If he made it to college, I'm betting he can do the things he needs to. The other commentor's point is that ND people can learn what they need to do, it's also their responsibility to find a way as an adult. There's a difference between can't and won't. I work with ND and other disabled teens and I can tell you that if this guy is at college, he must be pretty capable. \nYour point about society being more inclusive is fine, but the onus is still on folks with disability to learn what they can and not be lazy. They can be just as slack and picky about what they will and wont do as anyone else. Again, I work with different types of teens and their attitude is often their problem, more than their disability.", "As a boomer with autism, you\u2019re being an asshat. I regularly google how to do things. I\u2019m a visual learner, so watching a video is a great way for me to learn something new. Also, where to find the button to open the gas tank on a rental car.", "I think OP's using them to mean the same thing? OP explained they literally didn't mean balancing a cheque book, but to monitor the balance of a bank account, and determine spending from there. It's like a truncated version of budgeting", "It's not really an agreement to disagree, they clarified exactly what they meant. The answer is there, they told you", "For me, when my fight-or-flight kicks in, I freeze up. At least when it comes to doing tasks that spike my anxiety or nerves.\n\nBut in a crisis situation (Car wreck, someone getting injured, fire, etc) I just... do what needs to be done. I can't explain it.  I was a Firefighter and Paramedic and never had a problem in stressful situations regarding emergencies...  but I'll be damned if I can't just make a simple phone call to pay an overdue bill; or deal with some other \"adult\" responsibility. \n\nEven cleaning, when it involves more than just washing a couple dishes or tossing laundry into a basket, becomes overwhelming and I just freeze up.", "What worked for you doesn\u2019t work for everyone. People showed me multiple times how to do the most basic of long division. It was gibberish and I never did learn it. However I watched maybe two videos online on applying gel polish and have gotten quite good at it since . Not all people learn the same way. They stated how they learn best and sometimes a person does in fact need to face the consequences of their actions.", "And so what??? What is the other option for those without parents that have the will, time, motivation and care to ask what to do on reddit, insurance/money for therapy or their own will, time, motivation to not be \"unhealthy\"?

Compared to someone who lived through the nightmare of their college and career attempts over 15 years to earn an bachelors... meanwhile trying not to unalive themselves because they had no f***ing clue what was wrong with their brain and everyone thought they were weird because they viewed life differently.\n\nI'm sure you know more than me about the subject matter at hand. \n\nFor the record, I don't assume...

You're not a child; you're damn near geriatric. Your input is both irrelevant and outdated. Telling a child to Google something that you should have taught them shows you shouldn't have kids. If that bothers you, be better.", "I completely get this. Most people don't have someone or multiple people that can take away the \"negative\" consequence, so we deal with it. \"Unhealthy\" or \"healthy\" just isn't a choice most people have. Not against anything you said just speaking to some of the previous comments, some of us jut have to... live anyway.", "Um, didn't say I was an expert. But neither are you... people on the spectrum, who have ADHD, have ID etc are all different. Your experience, is just that, one experience. I only said that attitude is very importamt, as I am sure you will agree. Refusing to tackle one's problems is not the answer. Good for you to keep perservering and finding solutions and not blame everyone else. Even normies struggle, can have trauma, learning difficulties, mental health.problems etc. Waitng for the world to change and create precisely what you need is not a winning formula for success. Asking for help, accepting help when offered, reaching out to professionals and advocacy groups should help. In my country, there are many, many places to turn and lots of funding available for help.\nAs for being ableist, I don't go around assuming every one with a problem has a disability, that would be weird., not ableist."]}
