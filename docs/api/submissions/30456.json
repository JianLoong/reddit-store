And no, just tossing cash at him won't fix a thing. But not that this is out of the way, it is up to you if you want to try to help him. And by that I mean help him learn how to manage things like his checking account, credit card, etc.   \n\n\nA financial management trick my father taught me was to write down, on a card or notepad, everything he spent money on. Buy a coffee, write it down, purchase school books, record that, grab beers with your buddies, and so on. My Dad started to do that once when he was pretty broke. He said the amazing thing is that once he was writing all of his expenses down it became clear how quickly he could spend money. Then the list let him look back to see what he spent each week or month, to find ways to cut costs. Then as he made adjustments he could see what worked and what didn't. Dad also made conscious choices to do low cost or free activities rather than ones that cost $$$, like meeting friends to hang out in a park instead of a bar, doing a potluck dinner rather than going out, etc.   \n\n\n The other thing your son needs to learn is to NOT use the credit card except in extreme cases.  Use cash or a Debit card or payment app tied to his checking. That way he is less likely to run up more debt. Now there will be times that he has to use the card, like if he needs textbooks and his next paycheck is a few days or a week away. But that literally is all that card should be for.   \n\n\nSo sit him down and talk about his monthly budget, both personal expenses, school fees and books, etc. Then work out a plan for how he will manage those expenses on the income he has. At first this will hurt, but at 19 he needs to learn these lessons now or he's going to be buried in debt and never get out of it.", "NTA. He\u2019s doing it on purpose.

Customer (son) becomes unhappy and wants to escalate to manager (grandparents).  Manager (grandparents) has no idea of the history.  No idea how many times the customer (son) has been given chances, given stuff they shouldn\u2019t have and has still failed to do things the right way.  Customer (son) presents a heavily edited case to manager (grandparents) who believe this and take it at face value.  They see a simple one-time error and an employee (daughter/DIL) who is being harsh/unfair etc.  Manager (grandparents) immediately grant request and offer sympathy.  Manager (grandparents) then remonstrate with employee (daughter/DIL)\n\nAt work you deal with this by keeping notes and, if appropriate, keeping manager in the loop.\n\nAt home you can only do this after the fact.  You can only do as you did here and explain the previous multiple abuses before you had to finally say no.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to have a sit down with the grandparents and agree a strategy for moving forward.\n\nI had this happen at work.  Customer repeated the behavior until the manager cut them off, escalated to higher management - rinse and repeat, then to a director who got them to \u2018promise\u2019 to not screw us over if he helped them  \u2018one more time\u2019. Customer screwed him for a HUGE amount of money.  If the escalation had been dealt with properly everyone would\u2019ve been happy, even the customer eventually.\n\nWho would he go to if the grandparents said no?

That seems like a decent starting place to learn to actually spend less than he has. It\u2019s shocking to me to learn that some people keep the debt riding along as a totally normal thing that they don\u2019t even try to avoid (and many of them could).

You can't simply look at your bank statement and think, \"OK, I have $20 in my account, and this costs $15, I can afford it.\" Instead, it becomes (especially if you use autopay), \"OK, I have $3000 in my account. The mortgage is going to be $2800. The electricity is going to be $5\\*, gas is going to be about $70, water is going to cost around $70, and trash is going to cost $30.

I personally think someone like that would benefit from balancing a checkbook simply to be aware of what money they have and where it goes.\n\nAnother reason is that some people need to be really in touch with their account and actually need to visualize how much they\u2019re spending. I was one of those before I figured out how to mentally anticipate how much money was going to come out of my account and how much free money (basically any hypothetical money left over after general living cost) I had.

That's something I *would* have to work to keep track of.", "Anyone who runs their account at or close to 0 honestly needs to keep some kind of track. Charges have 2 stages, pending and posted.

The charges generally don't post until the transaction is complete, so for a week/month long rental it's when you turn the car in, for a hotel, it's when you check out, and for online orders, it's when the product ships.   \n\n\nHertz bills your card for your weeklong rental, which drops off, then you extend it, and they run a second charge for the extension, which also falls off, and when you turn it in, they collect for the full rental period. The customer just went by the balance in their account and since they \"saw it come out\", assumed that's just how much they had. Now their account's negative $900, they're screaming at some customer service rep that the bank stole their money, and they're insisting the funds never went back because there is no credit, even though there is no charge.  \n\n\nWe'd get calls stating \"I should have x amount of money, where did my money go?\", and even when you start at a time/amount they agree was correct, then go through every charge since, total it up, and get the same balance, they'd insist they're still missing money because they never actually know how much is in their account.", "Maybe it's a Chase bank thing, but I was momentarily confused because my online payments to student loans and energy bill was not shown as pending on my transactions, whereas my grocery shopping trip was.

What _gadget_girl did was try to be fair about the situation. It's too easy to assume. Obvious things aren't always obvious for everyone.

Or like someone said elsewhere, he could have some kind of learning/attention issue.\n\nI'm coming from the point of view that he was genuinely upset that he wasn't taught to budget. Asking for the money is shitty, but he's just a kid. Not legally, but he can't drink, smoke, or rent a car. I was pretty emotionally unstable at 19, like many teens. \n\nHe can still learn from his mistakes without feeling neglected, which is how he might feel if he is actually hurting rather than trying to grab what he can from OP.\n\nWe only have one perspective on the situation, so I'm assuming the truth is somewhere between OP's and the son's POV. I can't condemn either, but want a solution that can be good for both.", "Funnily enough, if you are about to overcharge or empty an account, it turns red on my banks\u2019 online stuff! \n\nAsk me how I found that out lol", "Wait.... when I was 19 and in this situation, I wouldn't have called my father because he was horrid at finance management....\n\nPS: Are absentee fathers no longer a thing that Gen Z has to worry about?", "That's why I loved it when we got to a three month emergency fund. We set an amount, let's say $4000, and that's the bare minimum we need in that account.

They'd spend $300, then check and spend another $300, ending up in the red once all the transactions hit. \n\nPersonally, I track all my cards, bills and income via Excel, allowing me to itemize in a granular and personal fashion (i.e. home improvement, car parts for my car, car parts for cars I'm reselling, car sales price/profit, etc.). This also creates a running total prior to pending charges posted, so I know how much was already spent.", "Ah that makes sense. For me I've had my bank account since I was 8 (co-owned by my mom). I've been taught to keep track of it ever since then and when I was 18 my mom gave me full control of it without parental supervision anymore. I guess I took it for granted how many people are actually familiarized with banking processes. When I was 8 I honestly thought all children got their own bank accounts with their parents at that age since my siblings did too.\n\nEven now I still forget that not everyone would just automatically understand how credit processing works.", "My budget would be what is in my account above a certain amount.

BUT he's also an AH if his reaction is to blame and charge his teacher.\n\nWhenever I had a hard time learning chores and other things that I found boring, I felt like a worthless piece of shit human, not like the people trying to teach me were to blame. Heck, I grew up with internet, as any 19yo will also have, and if someone doesn't teach you well, you can go and learn for yourself with a little more effort (or less, depending on the person).", "It isn\u2019t always obvious.
