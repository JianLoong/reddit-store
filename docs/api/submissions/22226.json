You should be talking to Matt at this point, not Mom. She doesn't get a say. Give Matt a clear date to get her out. If he doesn't comply, begin eviction procedures. And talk to a lawyer about squatters in your state. \n\nAnd install some cameras in the common areas and your bedroom. If she is this entitled, she may think she owns the place or possibly may become destructive. Take precautions.\n\nMy random internet stranger take on the whole matter, Mom expects to use son as a retirement plan and is starting early.", "NTA.

There is a legally binding agreement and you've attempted to convey that and instead of respecting that the mother has decided her feelings outweigh that agreement.\n\nShe has now opted to refuse to leave the property, I recommend involving the authorities.", "NTA.

You will just have to have the lawyer try to talk to her and if that doesn't work than have the police evict her if they will ...I guess in the future you could add a clause in your lease that specifically says no over night guests include family members, but that won't help you now just an extra step to help prevent something like this again in the future.", "NTA , evict her, get police involved", "NTA.

Squatters have more rights than landlords these days, so don\u2019t let her get a foothold! You have a lease, you notified her (and him), what would happen if this continued!

If she says she pays his rent, then she can pay it elsewhere because it looks like her stubbornness is going to get them evicted. \n\nHowever, I haven\u2019t read anything about Matt\u2019s reaction? It looks like he\u2019s just ignoring the situation thinking it\u2019ll resolve itself and not taking the consequences seriously.

If she's happy to share a room with her kids she can get a studio apartment for the three of them. I'm wondering, what does Matt have to say about this situation?", "He can\u2019t talk to Matt.

My gut says Matt is having a rough time because Mom decided she needed to take over his life by moving in.\n\nRegardless, Matt is the adult on the lease, not Mom. As such, these conversations need to happen with Matt. Her paying for the lease doesn't mean OP has to deal with her, only Matt. Mom is just deflecting with all her BS. OP doesn't have to deal with that. \n\nOn another level, if OP brings up eviction, it should be with Matt. If OP tells Mom, there is no guarantee she will relay this to Matt. Again, Matt is the adult on the lease and needs to be aware of the consequences of Mom's actions or he may just get blindsided.", "Oh tenants absolutely. Who the tenant decides to let into the place they are paying for?  Unlikely.\n\nIt would be interesting to learn which legal jurisdiction this property is situated within", "anyone occupying the space for an extended period of time is a tenant. from what i'm reading even in the uk you're only considered a guest for 2 weeks and it's legal for landlords to include clauses limiting overnight stays, especially if they live on the premises like op does.", "Yeah the timeframe we are discussing is overnight.  So whilst what you are saying is true, the rule is \"no overnight guests\".\n\nI would be surprised if this is legal", "she's been there for 2 days and is saying she wants to stay for the rest of the internship. the op lives in the home. even in the uk the landlord can add a clause to the lease limiting overnight guests. there is nothing questionable about any of this"]}
