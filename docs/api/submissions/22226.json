If she says she pays his rent, then she can pay it elsewhere because it looks like her stubbornness is going to get them evicted. \n\nHowever, I haven\u2019t read anything about Matt\u2019s reaction? It looks like he\u2019s just ignoring the situation thinking it\u2019ll resolve itself and not taking the consequences seriously. NTA", "I have questions about how she can afford his rent but not her own. Either she's terrible with money or she planned on this situation all along. \n\nNo matter what, NTA. If she's happy to share a room with her kids she can get a studio apartment for the three of them. I'm wondering, what does Matt have to say about this situation?", "He can\u2019t talk to Matt. Matt is having a rough time.", "I think I know why the kid is having a hard time. Can\u2019t imagine this woman raising a mature and well-adjusted kid.", "it's completely normal for rental agreements to have limits on the number of tenants. landlords also generally have more control when they live in the home", "My take on that is Mom said Matt is having a rough time. My gut says Matt is having a rough time because Mom decided she needed to take over his life by moving in.\n\nRegardless, Matt is the adult on the lease, not Mom. As such, these conversations need to happen with Matt. Her paying for the lease doesn't mean OP has to deal with her, only Matt. Mom is just deflecting with all her BS. OP doesn't have to deal with that. \n\nOn another level, if OP brings up eviction, it should be with Matt. If OP tells Mom, there is no guarantee she will relay this to Matt. Again, Matt is the adult on the lease and needs to be aware of the consequences of Mom's actions or he may just get blindsided.", "Oh tenants absolutely. Who the tenant decides to let into the place they are paying for?  Unlikely.\n\nIt would be interesting to learn which legal jurisdiction this property is situated within", "anyone occupying the space for an extended period of time is a tenant. from what i'm reading even in the uk you're only considered a guest for 2 weeks and it's legal for landlords to include clauses limiting overnight stays, especially if they live on the premises like op does.", "Yeah the timeframe we are discussing is overnight.  So whilst what you are saying is true, the rule is \"no overnight guests\".\n\nI would be surprised if this is legal", "she's been there for 2 days and is saying she wants to stay for the rest of the internship. the op lives in the home. even in the uk the landlord can add a clause to the lease limiting overnight guests. there is nothing questionable about any of this", "NTA. It's in the lease and if you made the exception for him, others would want the same treatment. \n\nInvolve the attorneys, law enforcement, and evict him while letting him know exactly why.", "NTA. Definitely evict them. I want to hear what happens!", "Nta, I'm so sorry Matt is gonna have the eviction on his record bc of his mom.", "Bigtime NTA.  She doesn't get to just come live at your property!  The mental health of the tenants is not your problem.  I definitely think you need to speak to Matt alone if possible, and maybe he can get rid of mom.  If not, you are well within your rights to have the authorities involved.", "NTA - you need to follow through and call the police and have them thrown out ASAP. Have a copy of his lease in hand showing the police officer where it says no overnight guests. Don't let this lag or go on any longer.", "NTA. Get her out", "NTA\n\nI would speak with your lawyer and figure out the exact steps to get Matt and his mother removed. But I would absolutely have police come and remove the mother and the daughter from the house", "INFO: What\u2019s going on with Matt? Is he possibly having a medical issue he needs live in care for? Or she just means having a hard time like emotionally?", "YWNBTA. Matt's mom doesn't sound like she is in healthy state of mind but that is not your problem to fix. Call the police and have her formally trespassed from the property today. Treat her like a stalker and Matt as the victim, don't punish him for her seemingly unhinged behavior.", "Kinda leaning towards YTA on this one. You whipped out a lease for some kid's mother wanting to stay with him, but you freely admit that you'll \"overlook a girlfriend or ONS\"? Why? If no overnight guests means NO overnight guests, then you need to enforce it across the board. If it's a risk factor thing, I'm pretty sure that random one-nighters are a bigger threat to your property than a helicopter mom.", "I hope you pro ide an update", "NTA, and all you can do is proceed with what you are already planning - a legal process to get her out of your house.", "NTA but is that legal to say no overnight guests?", "Please pull Matt aside and ask him his opinion. He shouldn\u2019t be punished for his mom breaking rules and being stubborn. Please explain the entire situation and the consequences, and you may be able to keep the police out of the issue", "NTA. In addition to the other advice you've received, I think you should consider notifying Matthew's internship supervisor of this situation. This does not speak kindly to his readiness for the workplace.", "Is Mom visiting or living with Matt? Like OP said his place is not a hotel or AirBnB. Matt's mom needs to leave ASAP. NTA.", "If you don't follow through with your legal promises then you will have no power as a landlord moving forward.  Do what you say.  NTA, but follow through.", "NTA, although this setup would be illegal in my town so it'd be an ESH.\n\nHowever I'm going to assume what you're doing is legal, and mom is definitely an AH.", "NTA.  Time to get the police involved and serve Matt as well.", "Does OP rent out more than one room at a time? Because, if so let's not forget the other tenants in the house who now have to deal with 2 more people using bathrooms and the common rooms. That isn't fair to them, either.", "Now she's squatting and making things worse for both herself and her Son.NAT", "She\u2019s not homeless she drove here treating it like a vacation home for her and her other daughter. Staying in the shared spaces that the other 3 tenants use and even started a fight with one of our female tenants when she asked her to help clean up the kitchen after she made a mess cooking for her son.", "The mental health of the tenants is not your problem. I definitely think you need to speak to Matt alone if possible, and maybe he can get rid of mom.", "There\u2019s 3 other people including myself who doesn\u2019t want her or the daughter there. Matt isn\u2019t the only renter on the property.", ">  If no overnight guests means NO overnight guests, then you need to enforce it across the board.\n\nThat's not how life works no. When you're the one renting out rooms, you decide how and when you enforce those rules. This isn't a public debate in which some superior power comes down and make the room renter adhere to rules.", "[removed]", "I know, but that doesn't make him not TA, IMO. If the rule is actually \"no *long-term* guests\", then he needs to say that.", "While I agree that OP is NTA, it\u2019s unfair to makes assumptions about Matt and his relationship with his mother. For all we know Matt has also been telling her to leave and is likely embarrassed about the situation.", "Bot", "Well, I do agree matt needs to be involved in these conversations but it is absolutely relevant to speak to her as well because she is refusing to leave the property when she's been asked by the property owner to leave.", "He said X, and choose how he tolerates around it. That rule is a baseline, and him being flexible for the right reasons doesn't make him an AH when someone decides that they can abuse for the wrong reasons.", "Op should get a quick conversation with a local lawyer.   While this is likely true, local laws can vary widely."]}
