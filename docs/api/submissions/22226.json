My gut says Matt is having a rough time because Mom decided she needed to take over his life by moving in.\n\nRegardless, Matt is the adult on the lease, not Mom. As such, these conversations need to happen with Matt. Her paying for the lease doesn't mean OP has to deal with her, only Matt. Mom is just deflecting with all her BS. OP doesn't have to deal with that. \n\nOn another level, if OP brings up eviction, it should be with Matt. If OP tells Mom, there is no guarantee she will relay this to Matt.

So whilst what you are saying is true, the rule is \"no overnight guests\".\n\nI would be surprised if this is legal", "she's been there for 2 days and is saying she wants to stay for the rest of the internship. the op lives in the home. even in the uk the landlord can add a clause to the lease limiting overnight guests. there is nothing questionable about any of this", "NTA.

She doesn't get to just come live at your property!  The mental health of the tenants is not your problem.

If it's not great for the 19 year old to be under helicopter squatter mom's thumb, it's equally unfair to minor sister to be in the middle of a tenant disagreement involving police because of her.", "nta but i really want an update yo", "Evict them all.", "NTA. Do as you have threatened and serve Matt and his mother a WRITTEN notice to vacate due to lease violations. Check your lawyer for the local tenant landlord law and act NOW. \n\nSome areas you can give 1 months notice and then longer if they refuse to leave and you have to take them court.\n\nOnce a tenant relationship goes south, you need to act, it appears that she plans to do what she wants no matter what you say.\n\nMatt and his family should find a place where they can be together comfortably.", "NTA. Doesn\u2019t matter if she pays his rent if it\u2019s his name on the lease.", "NTA. I have to wonder what the bed setup is in Matt's room if is mother and sister are sleeping in it with him?", "Scrolled too far to find this. The comments are exceptionally lacking in empathy.", "If it were something that serious, wouldn\u2019t he just go back to his moms home? If it is some sort of moral support, mom needs to find a nearby hotel.", "Also I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re the asshole, it just seems like an odd arrangement that I\u2019ve never heard of.", "Get them out of there before your other renters either a) ask for reimbursement/reduction in rent or b) start bring their own overnight guests under the assumption that there are no consequences.\n\nTime to bring out the police and eviction papers before the problem gets bigger than it has to be.", "NOt to mention, the other tenants could bring legal action against OP for not enforcing the \"no overnight guests\" clause on Matt, thus forcing them to deal with mother and sister..not fair and needs to be addressed ASAP!", "Well there goes justnomil", "...and aunts.", "What kind of lease says no overnight guests? Wtf.", "Proceed with eviction. If not the other guests will wonder why.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Trespass her right away and evict Matt. Don't try reasoning with or humoring crazy; it never ends well.", "NTA - get police involved if necessary to remove mom from premises, evict Matt if needed for breaking lease. These people are more trouble than they are worth.", "Sorry you're facing this. One possible solution might be to have mom charged with trespassing. Youve told her to leave and she hasn't. Shes not on the lease. Ergo, she's a trespasser. Maybe a pair of cuffs will oook good on her...", "NTA \n\nHoly Batman!\n\nHonestly I can\u2019t imagine Matt is loving this!\n\nBut that Mummy is a problem for your home", "NTA. Trash mom is really gonna get her son homeless for what?", "A good one - when you are renting out rooms in a house.", "OP is renting rooms in her house, having no overnight guests is a given in this situation. You want to have people stay over go rent an entire apartment then.", "Ugh.  I had a renter like this when I bought my first home.  I rented a room to an 18 year-old college student whose parents liked the idea of her living with a responsible adult female.  The mom paid her rent and just showed up to my house to stay for a week *with her dog* who chewed up my screen door.  \n\nCall the police immediately and have her trespassed.  You are the owner of the home. She is not on the lease, she is not a legal tenant.  The law is on your side here.  She\u2019s either banking on you not doing it or is self-righteous enough to believe she can\u2019t be wrong.  Entitlement like this burns me up.  Let the cops kindly show her out the door.", "LMAO!", "Jesus. Would hate to live with the OP. sounds like a prison.", "In most places you can't have them arrested because as long as the tenant says they are a guest, they are allowed to be there no matter what the lease says.  You would have to evict the tenant to get them all out.", "NTA. That\u2019s unreasonable.", "NTA", "NTA. You have a woman who is determined to break the rules to get her way. No amount of reasoning will help you get her off. Even if she says she pays for Matt's lease, the lease is between you and Matt. Better be equally stubborn and get rid off her otherwise you will find others pulling the same sh\\*t in the future.", "I think it makes a difference if its just a single room vs an entire suite.", "Call the police and have her removed", "NTA, Now she's squatting and making things worse for both herself and her Son.", "Serve him with eviction notice. NTA", "Serve him with eviction notice. NTA", "Honestly I\u2019d just be a bouncer in my own house and march her out by the scruff of the neck. She\u2019s a trespasser with zero right to be there, so toss her out on her arse.", "nta evict them."]}
