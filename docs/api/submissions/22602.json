I32f was married to my \u201cboyfriend\u201d for several years. We dated through highschool, and married in college. Have 3 children together. We divorced about 4 years ago. During this time he had a few girlfriends, including his most recent he got pregnant. They split up during the pregnancy, due to her toxic ways. A month or so after the breakup, was our daughters birthday, which he attended. We talked a lot and decided to reconcile our marriage. There has been talk from time to time the past 4 years, but we really decided to make an effort this time. \n\nObviously his baby mama wasn\u2019t very happy about this, and although I had many confusing emotions about her pregnancy I was supportive of my husband through it all. Last week we got a call in the middle of the night saying his ex was being taken to hospital for emergency c-section, and she was having medical complications. My husband was an emotion mess, we rushed to the hospital. They wouldn\u2019t allow him back, since we got there too late and due to the severity of the situation. We waited patiently, until allowed back to her room, in which I was already getting dirty looks from relatives there.\n\nThe baby was brought back first, then her, which she was very doped up. I sat there for awhile silently, respectfully while my husband held his child, and tried to make small chit chat with his ex. Everything went smooth, we stayed for a few hours, before we had to head back due to the kids and work. The next day we planned to visit again, but my husbands ex called my husband screaming I had no right to be there, and if she wasn\u2019t o so doped up she wouldve have security take me out. My husband tried to explain that I came for support, but she hung up on him. Then I began getting angry text from her saying I have no right, and she didn\u2019t want to see me at the hospital again. I said I only came to support my partner, and that I didn\u2019t want any drama. She said I wanted the drama the minute I stole her baby father. I told her I didn\u2019t steal no one, I had a life 10+ years with him, and 3 kids. That I came to make sure her and the baby were okay. She then called me a nosy bitch, and said if I stepped foot in her hospital room again she\u2019d have me removed. \n\nI came honestly for my partner. I didn\u2019t want any drama. It was for support.

Especially after they have had such a horrifically traumatic birthing experience. \n\nThe fact is that you should not have been anywhere near that room for any reason.

Not sure if you did it on purpose with malicious intent or you were just super naive about this, but being in the mother's room when he met the baby for the first time, and while she was completely doped up after a complicated birth was completely out of line. And what makes it worse is that in a way, you were able to see the baby before even she was because she was still completely drugged at the time and might not have been able to see/function/remember correctly. Imagine if you gave birth to one of your children after you and your then husband broke up and he showed up with his then-girlfriend. How insensitive is that? Very. YTA.", "YTA.

Absolutely not.", "Sorry, bringing him to the hospital if he genuinely needed you for support is fine, as long as you are discrete about it, find an out of the way spot and try to avoid being seen by her family if he insists on you being there. However, going in the room of an exhausted and probably scared brand new mother was absolutely an AH move. Those first moments are for mother and child. It's probably difficult enough for her to accept you will be part of this child's life but those moments right after your child is born are precious and you never get them back. Nobody wants people they don't care for there in those moments. You stole that from her by going into that room. Maybe that wasn't your intention so maybe you were just being incredibly thoughtless. Either way, if you want to have ANY hope of not having 18 years of a really contentious relationship with the ex (and probably the child) you need to apologize and own that what you did was hurtful and that you realize you stole something from her that she can never get back. I'd also tell her that going forward, you will be more respectful of her feelings...and then follow through on that commitment.", "Have you considered that maybe now isn\u2019t the best time to reconcile? And maybe he has a lot of chaos going on in his life that he should be focusing on instead?

On what planet do you live, to think that your presence in the hospital room of his ex, who had just given birth, wasn't going to cause an issue. You just wanted to make it clear that this is my man, and I'm here to stay. \n\nThis baby, his parenting of this baby, and his co parenting relationship with the mother is nothing to do with you.

Waiting room only!", ">the reality is that when someone gives birth they set the rules\n\nThis right here. Ignoring the ridiculously complex situation... It doesn't matter who you are, if someone is in hospital and vulnerable, they have the right to say who is allowed to visit them. \n\nWhen my sister gave birth (and when she will again), she banned our mam from the delivery room because our mam has untreated anxiety issues and would absolutely not be helpful or supportive but rather flap and be worried. \n\nShe understood/understands it's my sister's choice, even though she'd like to be there. \n\nI can't imagine the extra audacity of someone's \"new\" or \"returning\" partner showing up.", "They all sound toxic, and this is just going to continue to be a toxic co-parenting situation. I know some people will disagree, but adoption might be the kindest route here for the child.", "The postpartum mother was the one trying to start drama? Come on.

She could've said a lot worse.", "I feel this is a grey area, it does not sound like there was anyone from his side of the family at the hospital to support him we do not know why. If he wants her there as a support person while his child is being born especially given there were complications that seems reasonable. I can understand that she would be unwelcome by most people on the mothers side but the only people who matter here are the parents and had she stayed away from the mother I would think it was a reasonable compromise. If something awful had happened he would need someone there for support, at the very least it sounds like he was in no condition to drive himself there", "Don\u2019t pee on my leg and tell me it\u2019s raining!", ">I do wonder how toxic she actually was. What OP and her boyfriend/ex did was pretty damn toxic\u2026\n\nOne of the most important lessons I learnt from my own most toxic ex, was - it's not the \"other woman\" who is toxic. Regardless of gender, it's the cheater or the one who wants to \"keep their options open\" and tries to return to you that is toxic. Every damn time. And they're the ones telling you the other person was toxic... Hmmm... I wonder why. \n\nLike I said, I had to learn this through experience but I never got to the stage of turning up in a fucking delivery ward! This is next level! Now, nearly ten years on, I'm in a happy relationship, and I pity the people my ex cheated with and then abandoned to come back to me when it felt convenient for him, but not in a condescending way, in an \"I'm sorry he fucked you over too\" way. \n\nHopefully OP learns this eventually.", "Why is he called your boyfriend after you say you're married but called your husband when he's having a child with another woman?

Definitely not your place to be there.", "YTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t want drama - yeah right. As someone with 3 kids you knew better. You even said she was doped up. You both took advantage of a woman who is drugged up who just gave birth? \n\n\nThat mom is gonna come at you guys for every penny and she deserves it after this bullshit.", "It sounds like you might actually he the toxic ex, not her. YTA.", "I could see staying in the waiting room being okay but that\u2019s it.

I suggest you are insecure and worried he will suddenly bond and want to be with her, which I can understand but the way you handled it was giant AH.
