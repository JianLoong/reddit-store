I32f was married to my \u201cboyfriend\u201d for several years. We dated through highschool, and married in college. Have 3 children together. We divorced about 4 years ago. During this time he had a few girlfriends, including his most recent he got pregnant. They split up during the pregnancy, due to her toxic ways. A month or so after the breakup, was our daughters birthday, which he attended. We talked a lot and decided to reconcile our marriage. There has been talk from time to time the past 4 years, but we really decided to make an effort this time. \n\nObviously his baby mama wasn\u2019t very happy about this, and although I had many confusing emotions about her pregnancy I was supportive of my husband through it all. Last week we got a call in the middle of the night saying his ex was being taken to hospital for emergency c-section, and she was having medical complications. My husband was an emotion mess, we rushed to the hospital. They wouldn\u2019t allow him back, since we got there too late and due to the severity of the situation. We waited patiently, until allowed back to her room, in which I was already getting dirty looks from relatives there.\n\nThe baby was brought back first, then her, which she was very doped up. I sat there for awhile silently, respectfully while my husband held his child, and tried to make small chit chat with his ex. Everything went smooth, we stayed for a few hours, before we had to head back due to the kids and work. The next day we planned to visit again, but my husbands ex called my husband screaming I had no right to be there, and if she wasn\u2019t o so doped up she wouldve have security take me out. My husband tried to explain that I came for support, but she hung up on him. Then I began getting angry text from her saying I have no right, and she didn\u2019t want to see me at the hospital again. I said I only came to support my partner, and that I didn\u2019t want any drama. She said I wanted the drama the minute I stole her baby father. I told her I didn\u2019t steal no one, I had a life 10+ years with him, and 3 kids. That I came to make sure her and the baby were okay. She then called me a nosy bitch, and said if I stepped foot in her hospital room again she\u2019d have me removed. \n\nI came honestly for my partner. I didn\u2019t want any drama. It was for support.

Period. \n\nThere are no exceptions to that. Not even for the father of the baby. Hell even if the person whose giving birth decides that they don't want the father in the hospital room, that is their right.\n\nFor you to decide you have the right to invade someone's birthing space is the ultimate level of entitlement. Especially after they have had such a horrifically traumatic birthing experience. \n\nThe fact is that you should not have been anywhere near that room for any reason. You forcing your way in there, because it's your partner's baby is inexcusable. Do not go back to the hospital. That is not your baby, it is their baby, and you being his wife means absolutely nothing in that equation.", "YTA. How would you have liked it if he\u2019d have brought one of his girlfriends to one of your births?", "YTA, you could have supported him from the waiting room, that is a major privacy violation on your part. \nShe just had a complicated birth, on top of being abandoned after becoming pregnant by her ex. Your boyfriend/ex husband is an asshole, and your acting like it\u2019s no biggie. I hope she gives y\u2019all hell.", "YTA. You were staking your claim on your ex husband and you know it.", "YTA. Was there something wrong with the chair in the lobby?", "YTA You know you did not belong in the new mother's room hospital room after she gave birth via emergency cesarean. You were not invited or welcome. If you want to \"support\" your philandering husband, do it from the waiting room.", "YTA - why on earth were you in her hospital room? That's extremely intrusive.

You waited until this woman was at her most vulnerable (toxic or not) to try to flex your \"winning the prize.\" Invaded a private moment, and the only information you have about her is what your greasy husband told you.

This was an intimate and scary moment for them.   Sorry but you didn\u2019t need to be in that room.  It\u2019s his child not yours.  It was highly inappropriate to be there.

Why would she need you there?\n\nYou didn\u2019t want any drama? You took back a man with a baby on the way that JUST broke up with a pregnant woman.

You could have waited in the waiting room if you were there to support your bf. You've experienced labor 3 times, so you know what a toll it takes - what a roller coaster ride of hormones and all sorts of stuff. You know how special those first moments are to bond with your baby. There isn't any logical or ethical reason for you to be there in that room. You know better, so be better. She told that she doesn't want you there, respect that. This is just the first few days of a lifetime dance you are going to be doing with his other family.

A woman\u2019s birth is one of the most personal and challenging things she can go through. Not only that, but it\u2019s a private medical event which everyone has a right to preserve. I\u2019m surprised the hospital even allowed you in the vicinity without permission from the mother. You likely ruined this woman\u2019s birth experience which already sounds traumatic. Your husband is an asshole for too for even thinking to invite you to \u201ccomfort him\u201d when his baby mama is in major surgery to give birth to THEIR child.

Absolutely insane.", "YTA - How can you be some oblivious and not read the room.", "As most have pointed out, you could have supported your boyfriend by going to the hospital with him, waiting with him in the waiting room, then STAYING THERE when he was given the all clear to go to the mother's room. Not sure if you did it on purpose with malicious intent or you were just super naive about this, but being in the mother's room when he met the baby for the first time, and while she was completely doped up after a complicated birth was completely out of line. And what makes it worse is that in a way, you were able to see the baby before even she was because she was still completely drugged at the time and might not have been able to see/function/remember correctly. Imagine if you gave birth to one of your children after you and your then husband broke up and he showed up with his then-girlfriend. How insensitive is that? Very. YTA.", "YTA. You asserted your dominance, now look at this from her perspective. There ain't no way in hell you would have been okay with the situation. How you don't see how fucking wrong you are is baffling.", "Of course YTA. You\u2019ve had children yourself. You know how that feels. To then turn up and be in the room after she gave birth is awful. You\u2019re trying to force your way in, and you don\u2019t need to. He\u2019s back with you. Absolutely zero need to rub it in her face like that.", "YTA.  I get that you wanted to support him, but this woman thought she was going to have a life with him & now she's not.  You're the woman who took him away from her (in her eyes).  Now she's having an emergency c-section with possible complications.  The last thing this woman needs is to see you.  You had no right to go into that room, causing her unnecessary stress when she just gave birth.  You should have either waited in the waiting room or stayed home.  You really had a lot of nerve going into her room to see the baby.", "YTA! \n\nBut why are you even with him.\nHe knocked up someone else! \nDoes no one have any self respect anymore.\nDo you really want to help him raise this baby with his crazy ex. \nSounds like a life of drama, tension and stress. \nGet a paternity test either way.", "ESH, but you more than her.\n\nIf you wanted to go just for support, wait in the waiting room or your car. You shouldn't have gone into the room. She is the one who had a terrifying traumatic surgery.\n\nI said \"ESH\" because she's wrong for accusing you of \"stealing her man\" and trying to start drama.
