It might not be possible depending on your situation. But having a separate place for sleeping would solve this problem.

He's either trying to be controlling, or he's in denial about his own sleep problems.

He's being codependent at best and controlling at worst. You shouldn't be expected to manage his sleep quality this way. You're not a teddy bear for him to use to soothe him to slumber.

You've already modified your behavior in response to his needs, which in my eyes are a bit questionable.

He needs to find something else that works.", "NTA. You are not a blankie. You are a living breathing person with your own set of habits and needs. Your boyfriend may not even realize he is doing this, but he is treating you like a prop for his sleep comfort and it is inappropriate.

Why are you willing to live like this?", "NTA. I was in this situation once. (Now ex-)bf had a totally different sleep rhythm than me, and he kept insisting that I change mine to his. It felt so infantilizing. We took another year to break up but that was definitely a factor. And it was not the only area in my life he wanted to control.

If you\u2019re not tired you\u2019ll just lie there wide awake, bored. I get tired first but then I\u2019m up earlier - even on the weekends. Does he get up later than you? Or earlier and insist that you also get up? Or is it just a night time thing? I find the whole thing ludicrous to be honest. As some have said, he\u2019s being controlling - sounds like he has to have you by his side and \u2018asleep\u2019 so he knows where you are and what you\u2019re doing/looking at", "NTA: Do you know who I went to with my sleep problems? My doctor who helped me find a lovely psychiatrist who has helped me find the right meds for my sleeping problems and my mental health issues as well as a nice therapist who has helped me come up with a tool to problem solve for myself.

I am a light sleeper and being awoken messes me up and means I can't get back to sleep easily, so I subconciously tense up if that's the situation.... I don't think he's being controlling, just has issues falling asleep. He should probably take melatonin, and just sleep well by himself.
