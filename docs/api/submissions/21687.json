In the second year of our relationship she got pregnant and I was so happy to be a dad, so excited to give my child everything I didn\u2019t have. Later on in the year, we welcomed a beautiful healthy baby boy.\n\nI should preface this a bit more by saying that myself and my ex are both pale Korean. So when my son was born of darker skin, I had some doubts but told myself that he would gain features that resembled his mom and I the more time went on. I was wrong. Within the first year of his life I knew that my son wasn\u2019t mine. Along with his darker skin, he has hair that defies gravity while mine and his mom\u2019s is as straight as needles. He has different facial features than the both of us. Despite knowing most of these within the first year of his life, I decided to stick around and raise him as my own because I already grew an attachment to him and vice versa. I of course didn\u2019t mention that I knew to my ex and whenever my family would question me about it, I\u2019d just say \u201che\u2019s my boy.\u201d \n\nOf course the the relationship with his mom and I ended, but for other reasons. Despite that I\u2019ve still stuck around to raise my son, he\u2019s 15 now and lives with me 75% of the time and with his mom the other 25%(it\u2019s just what works for us). Last week I took my son to get his haircut as he didn\u2019t want to grow out his afro anymore. He went back with his mom shortly afterwards and the day after I got a call from my ex telling me she needed to speak with me and that it was serious. We met up, and she sits me down very dramatically and proceeds to tell me that my son isn\u2019t my son and that he\u2019s her old coworker\u2019s son, and that he\u2019s in a very vital stage where he needs to learn about him and his biological dad\u2019s culture and what not. I told her that I knew. She looked shocked and confused. I told her that I wasn\u2019t stupid that I knew since the moment that he was born, and that I loved him and if he chooses to meet his bio dad then I fully support him. \n\nShe ended up getting mad at me saying that \u201cif you knew you should have said something and we could have prevented depriving him of his other culture long ago.\u201d When I brought up that she should\u2019ve told me she just said \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d That conversation ended and she went on to tell my son everything. He was rightfully upset and called me afterwards to pick him up(I told him that I had knew and just loved him from the beginning). He was upset with me for about a day, then he came to me and said he wanted to meet his bio dad. I said okay and called his mom, long story short bio dad doesn\u2019t want to be involved despite knowing about my son since he\u2019s been born. My son is still rightfully sore about the situation and my ex is saying it\u2019s just as much as my fault for not saying anything. Maybe if I did say something that he could have grown up with his real dad and didn\u2019t have to go through this or any of the other things he\u2019s experienced.

It\u2019s possible bio dad could come around to a meeting, but it sounds like he knew he had a bio child and rejected being a parent. You\u2019ve done the right thing.

Kudos to you.", "NTA. You literally said that bio dad knew about your son since day 1 and wanted nothing to do with him, so your ex getting mad about \"depriving your son of his culture and bio dad\" is crap. He didn't want to be involved at the beginning, so it wouldn't have mattered if you called her out on her cheating or not.\n\nShe just wants to spread out the anger she's getting from your son because of what she did.

You have done nothing but step up and be a real dad in all the ways that matter.", "NTA / you can learn about his culture together.", "NTA! You are obviously a beautiful human being and love your son deeply. His mother on the hand sounds manipulative. You are not at fault in any way here. May be you should take him out and have a long chat and reassure him that you love him and he is your son no matter what.", "nta. it takes a special person to do what you did. she\u2019s definitely the asshole for not only cheating, but lying about it for years and years, finally coming clean and then trying to turn the situation around on you.", "You didn't cheat. You didn't lie. You raised a child that you strongly suspected wasn't yours (sounds like you didn't do a DNA test). You are absolutely not in the wrong here.

And would affect this kid\u2019s upbringing.\n\nI believe that you were a consistent source of love and a good example for your son. You were there 100%. Just what a child needs.

Your ex is a dirty slute and now that her lies are imploding she wants to place blame on you. Would she have rather you kicked her to the curb 15 yrs ago? Then your son wouldn't have a father and probably would have had a much harder life. She is dumb. You are nta. You raised a child you knew wasn't your. That is a very noble thing to do, and what was best for the child. I hope your kid chooses to go NC with psycho mom.", "NTA - Is she seriously trying to blame YOU right now??? HAHAHAHA Jfc there is something mentally askew with her.\n\nHUGE kudos for being the kind of man that is smart enough to immediately know something's up, and loving enough to go \"Well, this is my son now, and that's all there is to it.\"\n\nHe has a \"real dad\". You. YOU are his 'real dad'. YOU are the one that loved him, supported him, encouraged him, taught him, etc. You raised him. That other cretin didn't care at any point for the past 17yrs. DIdnt care before he was born, didn't care after doesn't care now. There is nothing to 'earn' about - if it's an ethnicity issue, he can Google.\n\nHe's Korean, he grew up in a Korean household, that's the ethnicity that he was mainly raised picking up traits from. He just happens to be a darker-skinned, AfroKorean \\*shrug\\*\n\nHonestly I think she was hoping for some Hallmark moment where the biodad decided he wanted the teenager (ie. wanted HER still...) and she is salty that it is her selfness (YET AGAIN) that caused issues with her son. She hurt him and you, no one else did.", "NTA. There shouldn't be even any question. It takes a real man to raise another man's child.", "NTA.  We need more humans like you. And chances are, his sperm donor wouldn't have wanted anything to do with him as a child. Your son has lost nothing except respect for his mother.", "NTA\n\nGlad she\u2019s your ex though. She\u2019s got horrible morals.", "NTA Has the bio dad ever shown any interest? If they were coworkers he must have at least seen a photo at some point and said \u201cCongrats on your baby that looks exactly like me.\u201d It doesn\u2019t make sense that it\u2019s suddenly so imperative they have a relationship now.", ">Despite knowing most of these within the first year of his life, I decided to stick around and raise him as my own\n\nthat was not very smart but it doesn't make you the asshole", "NTA but your ex sure is for not checking with bio dad Before telling the son to meet him.", "NTA\n\nYou *are* his real dad in every way that counts", "NTA- You're probably the best person in your son's life, just keep being there for him, you're a stand up guy!", "NTA. Of course she's blaming you, she's trying to share her guilt for lying and cheating.", "NTA. You sound like a good man. Your ex has a lot of nerve blaming you, when she is the one who is clearly in the wrong.", "The title question is an easy n t a.\n\nThe real issue here though is are you and your ex right for suddenly dropping this issue on your son.\n\nESH for how both of you handled that.  \n\nNeither of you spoke with bio dad first?

Could have nothing to do with his feelings for his dad.", "I want to say something about the culture thing.  I'm assuming he's part Black. Or something similar.  Whatever he is, his bio dad is not the only one of it.  If he wants to explore the racial side more, there are probably a lot of books, movies, music, food, etc.  Not mention maybe other people.  Which also means your ex could have brought him up with a bit more of that culture without the bio dad if she had wanted to.  Does she know a bit more specifically what the culture is like Ethiopian vs Kenyan vs African American? If not, could be worth one more conversation with bio dad to find out.  And find out if there any other relatives that might want to know your son."]}
