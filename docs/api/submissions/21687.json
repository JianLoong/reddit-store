In the second year of our relationship she got pregnant and I was so happy to be a dad, so excited to give my child everything I didn\u2019t have. Later on in the year, we welcomed a beautiful healthy baby boy.\n\nI should preface this a bit more by saying that myself and my ex are both pale Korean. So when my son was born of darker skin, I had some doubts but told myself that he would gain features that resembled his mom and I the more time went on. I was wrong. Within the first year of his life I knew that my son wasn\u2019t mine. Along with his darker skin, he has hair that defies gravity while mine and his mom\u2019s is as straight as needles. He has different facial features than the both of us. Despite knowing most of these within the first year of his life, I decided to stick around and raise him as my own because I already grew an attachment to him and vice versa. I of course didn\u2019t mention that I knew to my ex and whenever my family would question me about it, I\u2019d just say \u201che\u2019s my boy.\u201d \n\nOf course the the relationship with his mom and I ended, but for other reasons. Despite that I\u2019ve still stuck around to raise my son, he\u2019s 15 now and lives with me 75% of the time and with his mom the other 25%(it\u2019s just what works for us). Last week I took my son to get his haircut as he didn\u2019t want to grow out his afro anymore. He went back with his mom shortly afterwards and the day after I got a call from my ex telling me she needed to speak with me and that it was serious. We met up, and she sits me down very dramatically and proceeds to tell me that my son isn\u2019t my son and that he\u2019s her old coworker\u2019s son, and that he\u2019s in a very vital stage where he needs to learn about him and his biological dad\u2019s culture and what not. I told her that I knew. She looked shocked and confused. I told her that I wasn\u2019t stupid that I knew since the moment that he was born, and that I loved him and if he chooses to meet his bio dad then I fully support him. \n\nShe ended up getting mad at me saying that \u201cif you knew you should have said something and we could have prevented depriving him of his other culture long ago.\u201d When I brought up that she should\u2019ve told me she just said \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d That conversation ended and she went on to tell my son everything. He was rightfully upset and called me afterwards to pick him up(I told him that I had knew and just loved him from the beginning). He was upset with me for about a day, then he came to me and said he wanted to meet his bio dad. I said okay and called his mom, long story short bio dad doesn\u2019t want to be involved despite knowing about my son since he\u2019s been born. My son is still rightfully sore about the situation and my ex is saying it\u2019s just as much as my fault for not saying anything. Maybe if I did say something that he could have grown up with his real dad and didn\u2019t have to go through this or any of the other things he\u2019s experienced.
