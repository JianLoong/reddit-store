In the second year of our relationship she got pregnant and I was so happy to be a dad, so excited to give my child everything I didn\u2019t have. Later on in the year, we welcomed a beautiful healthy baby boy.\n\nI should preface this a bit more by saying that myself and my ex are both pale Korean. So when my son was born of darker skin, I had some doubts but told myself that he would gain features that resembled his mom and I the more time went on. I was wrong. Within the first year of his life I knew that my son wasn\u2019t mine. Along with his darker skin, he has hair that defies gravity while mine and his mom\u2019s is as straight as needles. He has different facial features than the both of us. Despite knowing most of these within the first year of his life, I decided to stick around and raise him as my own because I already grew an attachment to him and vice versa. I of course didn\u2019t mention that I knew to my ex and whenever my family would question me about it, I\u2019d just say \u201che\u2019s my boy.\u201d \n\nOf course the the relationship with his mom and I ended, but for other reasons. Despite that I\u2019ve still stuck around to raise my son, he\u2019s 15 now and lives with me 75% of the time and with his mom the other 25%(it\u2019s just what works for us). Last week I took my son to get his haircut as he didn\u2019t want to grow out his afro anymore. He went back with his mom shortly afterwards and the day after I got a call from my ex telling me she needed to speak with me and that it was serious. We met up, and she sits me down very dramatically and proceeds to tell me that my son isn\u2019t my son and that he\u2019s her old coworker\u2019s son, and that he\u2019s in a very vital stage where he needs to learn about him and his biological dad\u2019s culture and what not. I told her that I knew. She looked shocked and confused. I told her that I wasn\u2019t stupid that I knew since the moment that he was born, and that I loved him and if he chooses to meet his bio dad then I fully support him. \n\nShe ended up getting mad at me saying that \u201cif you knew you should have said something and we could have prevented depriving him of his other culture long ago.\u201d When I brought up that she should\u2019ve told me she just said \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d That conversation ended and she went on to tell my son everything. He was rightfully upset and called me afterwards to pick him up(I told him that I had knew and just loved him from the beginning). He was upset with me for about a day, then he came to me and said he wanted to meet his bio dad. I said okay and called his mom, long story short bio dad doesn\u2019t want to be involved despite knowing about my son since he\u2019s been born. My son is still rightfully sore about the situation and my ex is saying it\u2019s just as much as my fault for not saying anything. Maybe if I did say something that he could have grown up with his real dad and didn\u2019t have to go through this or any of the other things he\u2019s experienced.

Don\u2019t listen to her. You\u2019re a good man and a great father.", "It's obvious that accountability is not in her vocabulary. I wish you and your son well.\n\nI would not speak another word to her.", "NTA - ask your son if he wants to stay with you 100% and fight for full custody. A judge will listen to a 15 year old.\n\nHe did grow up with a real dad - thats you. His sperm donor knew he was alive from day 1 and didnt care.", "NTA. What a great dad you are!", "ESH.\n\nyou didn\u2019t owe your ex jack shit, f her. \n\nyou did owe your son the truth, or at least a plan for when this situation eventually came up. I think you could\u2019ve handled that better, or taken initiative. calling you an AH for it may be a bit much though, but still, you could\u2019ve done better by your son.", "NTA. Your ex knows how this will play out with your son. One of you is a liar, the other is a hero. Yes, you could have told him sooner, let him know that you always love him and his mother's mistakes aren't his. However, someone that steps up and loves his child as you seem to would understand the right time. You would know best when your son is equipped for it, mentally. \n\nYour son will end up closer to the FATHER THAT CHOSE HIM over the mother that hid his origin.  Keep being an amazing father, right now your son needs it. He found out his mother intentionally lied to him and the father he just found out about has wanted nothing to do with him his entire life.", "NTA, getting a woman pregnant might make you the father but being the one who is there to raise the child, protect them, teach them everything you can to help them in life. These are the things that make you Dad to them. Your son is lucky to have such an amazingly strong dad in his life.", "NTA. \n \n\"I know you don't actually think it's my fault, but if you want to say that for a few years we both know I can't stop you.\"", "NTA.  Are you the only person in this family with eyeballs?   Of course you knew.  Of course your ex had to know you knew unless she thought you were stupid.  Of course your boy would have figured it out eventually.", "There is a This American Life episode about a white family that had a mixed race son and no one acknowledged the child's physical differences until the kid was into teenage years as well.\n\nIt's act one of the episode Family Physics which aired first in 2002\n\nhttps://www.thisamericanlife.org/214/family-physics", "NTA but i\u2019m assuming his other half is black based on \u201cdarker skin\u201d and \u201cafro\u201d and it is really important for him to know his culture. Maybe you can try and figure out how to get him to spend time with bio dads family? even if he doesn\u2019t want to step up maybe his parents will? just a suggestion!", "NTA and what a wonderful man you are for raising YOUR son, despite biology", "NTA.\n\nYou are an honorable father, more the father to your son than the sperm donor.\n\nYour wife is TA for cheating on you, for lying to you, and by failing her son.", "NTA your ex is psychotic for cheating on you and then blaming you for loving the kid you raised.  The leaps of logic are as wide as a canyon.", "NTA. Biology does not make a parent but raising a child does. You raised that child and have been there for him when his sperm donor was not interested. That makes you his Dad.\n\nMy nephew\u2019s egg donor was never interested in being a mother to him. When my brother met his wife my nephew got a real mother with her. She was his step mother until he turned 18 then she adopted him when it wouldn\u2019t have cost an arm and a leg to take his egg donor to court.", "You are 100% opposite of an asshole. NTA!!!", "NTA, you\u2019re a really good dad", "I just want to say that he absolutely did grow up with his real dad.\n\nYou're it, man.", "The fact that she was shocked he knew the kid wasn't his biologically despite him being half a different race fom either of them is also comical. OP is a real one though", "Exactly, the way she's acting you'd think she would rather have been a single mother. What does she want him to do, force the AP to meet the son?", "This. \u2b06\ufe0f I would suggest finding a kind, compassionate therapist for your son, and maybe a mentor, \u201cBig Brother\u201d or group from his father\u2019s culture so that he can learn about his origins.  You are a great dad, he is your son, and I know he appreciates that.", "The audacity of that woman! Blaming OP for all of this? Unbelievable! NTA, but your ex certainly is.", "Nta, you are a great dad!  ((((Hugs to you and your son))))", " He's going through a hard time right now so what he needs from you right now is to be a solid rock, make sure he knows you're in his corner no matter what.", "I literally could not agree more. Good luck op.", " Definitely issues. Is she currently single? It sounds like she's been fantasizing about reuniting with bio dad. Why all of a sudden at 15, with 25% custody, is she worried about his cultural awareness?", "And if he wants to know more about the African part of his heritage, there\u2019s plenty of ways to get involved in that without mom and bio dad. OP mentions his son has type 4 hair; they can start by finding black-owned barber shops or hair salons so he has a chance to chat with older people from that culture who he doesn\u2019t have any prior baggage with.", "This is a comment stealing biy. Downvote and report! Original comment by u/Condensed_Sarcasm", "I understand that he's curious I just hope this whole situation doesn't affect his relationship with his dad  too much since he was upset with him too for knowing which I don't blame him.", "I'd fully expect a teenager to be very emotional and angry after finding out something like this and possible act out in a number of ways. From his pov, his place in the world and how he fits into it has been suddenly and irrevocably altered. I suspect that his dad is ready for that nd will continue to be there for him until he finds his footing. He's a lucky kid to have a dad like this.", "I get that. He probably should get jnto therapy to process this in a healthy. I've seen other post where the dads just dropped their kids once they found out they're their own so it's refreshing to read that op is not like that and still wants to be his dad despite what happened.", "And from day one. Not everyone has the ability to separate their beautiful boy from the mother's actions. The OP is kind, caring and an example of what a father should be. I have to think that will be clear to his son when the dust settles. I agree with you about therapy. He's got a lot to sort through and it's good to have a place where you can let out your ugly feelings as well as your generous ones without hurting anyone if only to see what they sound like out loud and realize that you don't mean them."]}
