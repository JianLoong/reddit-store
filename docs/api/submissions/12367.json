No, you don\u2019t need to eat her food. You don\u2019t have to like her food.

You don\u2019t call someone up and tell them you don\u2019t like the food they cook for you. You just don\u2019t. If you\u2019re pregnant you can say you\u2019re nauseous the night of the dinner and just eat very little. But it\u2019s just basic manners when you\u2019re being hosted to pretend the food is good. Yes, you might have to \u2018deal with this the rest of your life\u2019\u2014 who cares?

You can easily say, \"I am sorry X ingredient/dish is a huge aversion now that I am pregnant,\" because that is normal and reasonable, then just continue post pregnancy saying sorry, the food aversion stuck, but when you tell her you don't like her food at all and now that you're pregnant its completely intolerable, that is unkind and unnecessary. Your offer to teach her to make food from your culture is insult to injury because you made it clear she's not up to your expectations and your food is just better. \n\nMy MIL was/is a horrible cook and my husband is the first to say it. But we eat her food when she cooks and when we cook, she eats our food and acknowledges we're good cooks. She takes pointers and adapts her cooking for the better. My FIL reports her food is much better now that she's tried new things, mostly discovered through eating with us. You can softly influence someone or you can bludgeon them with nasty truth bombs... one will subtly improve your relationship and the other will result in you being an asshole!", "YTA - that was pretty rude.

Theres alot im confused about. Usually when its someone like an in law, how often can you really be expected to be eating food with them? Im assuming you dont meet THAT often. And honestly when it comes to food, its kind of easy to play it off by eating a little and then stopping. idk offering to teach her to cook may have offended her, especially when u say 'recipes from my homeland', its like the equivalent to u saying that their culture isnt as good as urs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand yes i also forgot to mention the pregnancy thing. thats a perfectly okay excuse as well.", "It sounds like you tried to do the right thing, but you couldn't.

YTA.", "YTA. You chose to marry a man from a different cultural background. That comes with acceptance of how they do things differently than yours. Eating bland food for the sake of peace is common courtesy, it would\u2019ve been different if it was repulsive. Your post reeks of \u201cmy culture is great, hers is bad.\u201d Did you seriously expect her not to be hurt/sad?", "INFO: If the mayo or ketchup are the main issue why not asking her to put you some aside before she adds it?

Mayo?? \ud83d\ude31 \n\n\nBut you shouldn't have offered to teach her to cook. This is a topic that requires a lifetime of polite denial. You host because its too hard to travel with a baby and you ask her to bring desserts and drinks because her desserts are sooo good. And you pick 2-3 things she makes that you can tolerate and you just fall in love with them. \n\nBut now you're screwed because of your mother's insanely bad advice.

How would you feel if your guest told you \"oh, I can teach you to cook nice food without all those spices\"?", "YTA.\n\nIt would be one thing if you had a medical condition that caused you to be sick from some of the ingredients used by your MIL, such as gluten or dairy, and she insisted on making it anyway. But in your situation, you just don't like the taste. Telling her you don't like her food \\*IS\\* disrespectful and makes you sound spoiled.\n\nYou could have told her that your pregnancy is making you very ill and there are limited things you can currently manage to eat, so would she mind if you brought a dish of your own (to share, but also for you to eat). She's had children, she would understand that.", "Yta but you got exactly what you wanted, she'll never cook for your ungrateful ass again.", "YTA. This is exactly what you wanted right? She says she will never cook for you ever again and that\u2019s exactly what you seemed to want. There were better ways to avoid eating the food rather than insult her, but in the end this is the exact end result you were looking for.", "YTA  Along with being mean and disrespectful.  You could have easily went over ate very little using the pregnancy as an excuse if needed but instead you used it to be an asshole. I feel bad for your husband, by making that phone call you also disregarded his feelings, he was asking for one meal with his family, not a nightly thing. You made it so that he can never have a true family meal again because if he goes over there you, his wife are not invited and chances are if you invite his family for a meal at your place chances are his mother won't come. Good job!", "Honestly, this is not a hill I would die on. You just insulted your MIL and your husband just because it\u2019s not your personal preference. \nN T A for having preference\u2026 but you slid into AH territory for calling your MIL and insulting her cooking.   You could have begged off eating because of your pregnancy and suck it up when you\u2019re not sick. You don\u2019t have to like something to be polite. \n\nYTA", "Sorry YTA. You can suck up eating her food every now and then. Just a few bites while you're there and eat something else when you get home. And offering to teach her some of your recipes just comes off as condescending. You know there are people from other cultures that may find your food \"bad\" because if the way its seasoned. It may not be what you're used to but it's not like it would kill you to eat it.", "big YTA. there's being honest-- it sounds like a simple \"sorry, i don't actually like mayo\" at the next meal you have together would cover a lot of ground with the foods she makes for you... and then there's calling your MIL to tell her you don't like her cooking, but you can teach her to cook better. calling someone just to insult them is not okay.", "Honestly, NTA. \n\nI had a fil who looooved to cook. But that did Not mean he had Any talent for it.\n\nI\u2019m both a very polite and a very honest person. So when he asked me what I thought of his stew I asked him \u201cI should tell you if your son hasn\u2019t already: I will always tell you my honest opinion if you ask it of me no matter the subject. I\u2019ll be kind about it sure but it will be honest. Do you want my honest opinion or do you want the standard polite answer the masses give?\u201d\n\nHe blinked twice and told me to be honest. \n\nAgain I reminded him that I will be Honest so is he sure.\n\nHe was.\n\nSo I told him that while I admired his enthusiasm and his generosity in wanting to cook for and share with everyone, I didn\u2019t really like his food. \n\nHe was quiet for a moment then asked what it was that I didn\u2019t like because if he knew he could do better.\n\nWe ended up completely disappearing into our own little world discussing cooking in general, but most importantly Seasoning and the fact that there is a middle ground between \u2018 still moving on the plate bloody\u2019 and \u2018ashes from a cremation done\u2019.\n\nWe actually ended up going to a cooking class together. \n\nHonestly I miss him more than my ex lol.\n\nMy point, sorry for the novel, is that you should be able to be honest and not walk on eggshells\u2026 though if they are a Really messy cook then there is a chance of having to Literally walk on eggshells in the kitchen.", "ESH. Your MIL sucks at cooking, your husband sucks at being the mediator in this situation, your family sucks for the advice they gave you and you suck for calling and basically saying \"your cooking makes me sick\".", "Mayo on everything?  Just the thought of that makes me gag. I can imagine pregnancy makes it worse. \n\nThat said, next time just bring your own food.  I had to do that when I was pregnant.  Omg.  I lost so much weight my first semester due to throwing up.  It was horrible.  I couldn't handle seeing, or smelling, raw meat.\n\nYou should have blamed the pregnancy hormones.  People on a diet bring their own food.  Its okay for you to do that too.", "I was curious, so I googled tortilla pizza with mayo.  Consistent five star ratings.\n\nThe MAYO Clinic has a recipe for tortilla pizza\u2026ironic it has no mayo..", "Let look at this from the other side -\n\n\"I enjoy my MILs cooking and learning about the food from her culture so I thought she would like to try some of my cooking. I invited MIL over for dinner but she refused to eat any of it because she's *not accustomed to eating the type of foods I use to making and since she''s pregnant it'll be really hard for her to swallow because of her nausea, she even offered to teach me the recipes from her homeland that I seemed to really enjoy.\"*\n\nSee how that sounds?\n\nYTA\n\nETA - mayo as a base on pizza - I'll give you that one - that's gross and I LOVE mayo lol", "YTA. Listen, when we go to my in-laws, we end up eating like, junk food on junk food. I end up craving salads after about 24 hours. But I either eat something before they serve dinner so I take a little and oops, I'm already full! or I politely eat what I can. I might one day say like \"oh, I'm not a huge fan of steak,\" but I would never ever call them up to tell them that seemingly out of the blue. \n\nMorning sickness was a good enough excuse to pass on the food. I can't keep food down that I *like* most days. I promise you will never, ever change the way she makes pizza or pasta.", "Are you serious? YTA.\n\nEdit because this one really grinded my gears: Food and cooking are extremely personal to people. Maybe she puts mayo on pizza because that\u2019s what her parents did. It doesn\u2019t sound too appetizing, but it\u2019s how she likes things. \n\nYou had so many other options to go about addressing this issue, and you chose the most inconsiderate and disrespectful one. Bring salt, pepper, and any other seasoning packets with you if the food is so terrible you can\u2019t bear to eat it. Offer to help and hop in the kitchen while she\u2019s cooking, and add spices while you\u2019re assisting. Always bring over your own prepared dish that compliments whatever she\u2019s making. \n\nLook, my mom isn\u2019t the greatest cook, but I\u2019ll eat whatever she gives me because it\u2019s a labor of love and makes her feel good. I\u2019ve made a habit of cooking *with* her and she\u2019s gotten so much better and opened up to new cuisines. It\u2019s a fun activity we now share. \n\nDo some self-reflection. What would be your honest opinion if she were to call you and tell you your food is weird and that she can show you how to cook properly? I\u2019d imagine it wouldn\u2019t feel too good. \n\nIn summation, people that claim to be blunt often just lack social grace.", "NTA. Assuming you phrased it just like you wrote, that you\u2019re not accustomed to that type of food and that pregnancy is making it harder for you to eat food like that. I think that was a perfectly polite way to explain it to her, and the fact she blew up on you was incredibly inappropriate. I\u2019ll never understand why some people are so offended by truth \u2014 especially when the truth is over something so trivial. It\u2019s not like you told her you don\u2019t like her, you just don\u2019t want to eat her food.\nShe\u2019s definitely an over sensitive jerk in this case and your husband should be supporting you, not coddling his mother and treating her like a temperamental child. You shouldn\u2019t have to walk on eggshells your entire life because she can\u2019t function.", "ESh you and your husband. In one comment you say he doesn't like the food either. He should have talked to his mum additionally to say immediately to teach her dishes from your country (was a good thought) but sounds like her country is not as good as yours.", "YTA if the ethnicities  were flipped you'd also be the racist.", "NTA, sometimes people are gonna give us honesty we don't wanna hear. Not enjoying being told the truth doesn't make it asshole behaviour unless it was entirely unnecessary, and I think the band-aid might have needed to come off here eventually.", "Well you didn't say she cooks bad, only that you don't like this type of food and are coming from a different culture, this doesn't mean MIL is a bad cook so I don't understand why she got so furious, NTA", "Awkward for sure but NTA. Sounds like your MIL is a dreadful cook. She probably boils bacon.\n\nAt least you ripped the band-aid off and won't have to worry about eating her food for a while!", "I was gonna say YTA off the title but mayo in pizza? Ketchup instead of tomato sauce? \ud83d\ude31That is gross! NTA!", "NTA. Your MIL overreacted and is now pretending to be a victim. If one of my children\u2019s SO wanted to share their food and culture with me I would be excited about it.", "NTA. As much as people are opining that you had the perfect excuse to avoid eating her cooking by being pregnant, that's not really the point. A lifetime of curbing her hospitality is just as uncomfortable as telling her how you really feel about her cooking, and it avoids the bad faith of continuing to pretend.", "NTA\n\nEspecially when pregnant it is hard to forcefully eat something one doesn't like.", "NTA sounds like someone had to tell her, and it sounds like she knows considering how mad she got. You did it nicely so you're fine.", "NTA. I think the pregnancy excuse was perfect. You also said it as respectfully as you could. Your husband and MIL being so upset seems inconsiderate, you tried your best to tough it out and because you didn\u2019t want to keep lying you told her the truth and she got upset. It also seems like you guys spend a lot of time with your ILs so it would be hard to always say you\u2019ve eaten or not hungry. I\u2019m sure if there was a meal from your cultural food they didn\u2019t like they\u2019d have no issues telling you that.", "Unpopular opinion apparently but I think NTA. There's probably a cultural difference in levels of honesty or bluntness as well as the food, considering your husband didn't want you to say anything about it, but your family did. It kind of reminds me of a situation like, you meet someone and like them but they really love football and you don't. Do you pretend to love football too to seem like you have things in common so they like you more? My short answer, no, but it seems like a reasonable white lie for some in order to get what they want, which for you is peace with your MIL regarding meals. Once you've said those little white lies, there's only two results: either you pretend to love football (or weird Midwest-sounding cooking) for the rest of your life, or they find out you lied about it and they may be upset, but at least you don't have to pretend to like football anymore. You can't be pregnant forever and use that as an excuse to not eat; it's only delaying the inevitable. From what you've said, I think I'd hate her cooking too, just as much as I hate football. \n\nI don't think there was anything wrong with you telling her, but maybe you can take a few days to think and plan, get some advice from your husband on how his mom likes to be spoken to, and speak to her again about how the cultural differences in broaching a conversation like this may have insulted her in a way you didn't intend.", "Gently, ESH.  Although the food sounds disgusting (are they by chance from the midwest?) there are more polite ways of handling this and you definitely should have discussed it with your husband first.      And expecting your MIL to learn to make your dishes is rude; imagine if your husband offered to teach his in laws to make him ketchup-mayo smothered foods especially for him.  It\u2019s just rude.  \n\nBut you\u2019re pregnant and the MIL should have made accommodations without going nuclear.  Maybe meeting at a restaurant you all agree on, or suggesting you bring your own food.  Find solutions that don\u2019t revolve around catering to you.", "NTA but I feel sorry for your husband. Poor guy, wish I could take him out fishing for a day or two.", "NTA. Am I they only one here that wouldn\u2019t get offended if someone told me they didn\u2019t like my food. \n\nI understand that people can be really proud of their cooking but it\u2019s not that deep. People have preferences and they\u2019re not shameful secrets never to be divulged. I\u2019m not going to eat something I don\u2019t like to protect someone\u2019s feelings. I\u2019d be even more upset if I found out someone kept eating my food not liking a specific ingredient in it because they didn\u2019t want to offend me. You like what you like, it\u2019s ok not to like things.", "NTA\n\nAh yes the typical \"don't rock the boat\" attitude. And according to your husband you should pretend for the rest of your life together to like the food just to keep the peace? Honesty and communication is always the correct way as long as it's delivered in a tactful way. And by the sounds of it the food of your MIL really sounds terrible. \n\nIf your husband and your MIL like it, that's OK. If you don't like it and told it in a polite manner, which you did according to how you wrote it, that's also OK. You even made an attempt to make her learn your traditional food. Your MIL isn't obligated to say yes to that but you are also not obligated to like the food she makes.", "I\u2019m not going to say Y T A because I think this is probably a culture clash beyond just the food (blunt honesty versus white lies). If there\u2019s any way to salvage it at this point, I\u2019d blame it on the nausea and pregnancy hormones.", "AH would be a strong word.  I still can't get past this mayo pizza abomination.  I mean, yeah choke it down I guess, but your MIL needs to come to grips with the fact that she should be banned from the kitchen.", "NTA- You are allowed to be a picky eater. Just say that. The more excuses you try to make the more of an AH you become.", "It might be too late but I still say you guys should have a day of cooking and getting to know each other's cultures. Hopefully you guys can figure it out before your little one has arrived.\n\nIs there anything of hers that she makes that you do like? What about cooking together to make that?

Reverse the situation and have your husband call your mother and say the same thing.", "YTA if it was the other way around you would call her racist", "When a partner asks you to pretend to keep the peace, that is red flag number one.   \nSit your husband down, and speak about this, even if he might not agree with you, he has to have your back, aslong as you keep communicating respectfully.   \nLike you said, he grew up with her food, you did not. So he doesn't know any better. Aslong as you keep it respectfull, you should be able to be honest. If your MiL can't handle that, that is on her.  \n\n\nNTA.

Countless times have I ate a meal from in laws or even my own mother that I didn\u2019t like thought was bland etc. very rude if you in my opinion, you\u2019re complaining about these occasional dinners is it really that hard to just take small portions and smile and say it\u2019s okay?", "NTA. Mayo as pizza sauce? Ketchup as pasta sauce? That\u2019s disgusting. This goes beyond culture; it sounds like your MIL is just a hick.

I\u2019d like to avoid that place.", "She lives fairly close to us and everytime she comes over she brings some food for her son and I.\n\nThe food she brings usually goes to waste because none of us wants to eat it and when I go over which is multiple times in one month she usually offers me some kinda food which I have to make excuses in order to avoid eating it", "I've known a couple people who act like bland food *is* repulsive and I just.

I know it's a bit uncharitable but I kinda think it's drama queen behavior.", "Its not just the mayo and ketchup that's the issues here those were just examples.\n\nThe texture of her food, the taste, it's just not for me", "It's a thing... I personally really dislike it but my mil seems to love it\n\nTo each their own I guess...", "Thank you.

Also, she may adapt or change her cooking in that time period.", "When you\u2019re no longer pregnant you go back to eating small amounts to be polite.

You contradicted yourself about your husband though, does he like her food or not?", "You have a husband problem then. He needs to tell his mom to stop bringing over food. This whole thing could have been avoided by him simply saying no thanks mom. On top of that, he could have let her know your likes and dislikes in private. Like no mayo ..\n\nThe whole mayo thing on everything is gross. I hate mayo in general. \n\nI think NTA. No way I would want to deal with that the rest of my life. Start inviting her out for dinner and avoid either of you cooking. Somewhere neutral where you both can get something you like and removes the food tension may help your relationship. Maybe letting her see things you'd pick at a restaurant would clue her in a bit.", "People do this for me a lot and it costs me nothing to be polite. Most of it I can't eat because of severe allergies, which I have politely mentioned, so I take it, thank them profusely, and either pass it along or throw it out. \n\nAgain it costs nothing to be polite and treat people nicely. It will not kill you!\n\nYTA", "Depends on what kind of bland it is. Is it just kind of low flavor? Add some salt/hot sauce/whatever and go about your life.\n\nBut there\u2019s another kind of bland\u2014think the way gum tastes after you\u2019ve been chewing it for an hour. Not even a ghost of a flavor left. All that\u2019s still going is the texture. When it\u2019s that kind of bland\u2014it\u2019s pretty repulsive.\n\nI still wouldn\u2019t say anything to the person who gave it to me, though. You smile big, take small portions, eat slowly, drink a lot of water. Or if you absolutely can\u2019t eat it because of an eating disorder (ARFID, I\u2019m looking at you) or something, you make up an excuse. I just ate, or my stomach is sensitive today, or I\u2019m doing intermittent fasting and can only eat from 9 pm to midnight.", "I said rock the boat because OP mentioned that husband said to pretend to like the food to keep the peace which for me is another saying of don't rock the boat. \n\nAnd to be honest reading how OP described the food it does sound like shit. She told MIL that in a diplomatic way and even offering to cook together.\n\nI wouldn't want to put up with that with the rest of my life to pretend to like the food to keep the peace. OP also mentioned in another comment that eating MILs food is quite frequent so yeah there's that.\n\nEdit: also OP mentions in a comment how the food goes to waste because no one wants to eat it when MIL brings it. So yeah that does imply that even the husband doesn't like the food.", "I'm curious what her mother in law is actually cooking for her to dislike everything.", "There is a huge difference in eating a meal once in a while that you don't like rather then constantly.\n\nLike me personally I'd be offended if someone was pretending to like my food. When I cook for other people it's for them rather then myself so for me to hear that they were forcing themselves to eat something they don't like would hurt my feelings more then them telling me the truth.\n\nMaybe it's a cultural difference but my whole family is like that too when I had friends come over  that didn't like the type of food I ate growing up, my mom would cook them something else and would make it a game to find something from our culture that they'd enjoy each time they'd come over", "Basically she\u2019s saying he excepts the food and let it goes to waste , not saying that he likes it but he grew up on it and is probably used to it", "My husband says he love his moms food and will eat it to be polite, he often downplay his dislike for her food.\n\nHe pefers my food and when she brings food to our place he'll leave it in the fridge and ends up rushing last minute when his mom is about to come over and pack it up and throw it in the apartment garage bin", "Yes it is if thats your constant excuse to not eat food. It is Not believable at some point anymore.", "You nailed it. I like a little bit of ketchup on my fries if it's a good ketchup and not a bland, watery mess. I hate when people dump tons of dressings, ketchup, and other condiments on my food.  Put it out there, and let me add it if I want.  Too bad they don't have chickens they could feed it to. They eat anything.", "I would rather want people to be \"inpolite\" to me which well..they arent in my opinion by telling me they dont like my cooking instead of throwing away perfectly good food and wasting it in that economy wtf? Yall rather lie and waste food than just being honest?? Id hate to find out someone lied to me for years about liking my food while they threw it away or forced it down. If you think its impolite to say you dont like someones cooking in a respectful way (that you never asked for)  ..thats just an ego Problem to me at that point", "I mean, everyone experiences the world differently so I guess this is just one of those blue and black/white and gold dress situations but *personally* I wouldn't be repulsed by something with no flavor, at least not how you're describing it. I spit out gum when my jaw hurts or I need my mouth for other things, not when the flavor is gone. I'd probably eat the no-flavor food and be weirdly impressed that someone managed to completely deflavorize a food. But that's just me personally and i certainly have some unusual food opinions of my own. To be clear, I have no problem with anyone politely turning down food for any reason, this isn't a judgement on the OP. The mayo tortilla pizza sounded really gross.", "It's not \"constant\". You said it's a few times a month. \n\nMaybe it is a cultural difference, but you should respect other people's cultures and not behave in ways that they consider to be rude, especially when they are a member of your family.", "You somehow missed all the words between commas in the second sentence. \n\nYour thinking is all about you and your wants vs other people.
