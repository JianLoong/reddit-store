No, you don\u2019t need to eat her food. You don\u2019t have to like her food.

Pregnancy was the perfect excuse to say you just couldn't eat the food because your sense of smell and taste is being weird, rather than insulting her cooking.", "YTA. You don\u2019t call someone up and tell them you don\u2019t like the food they cook for you. You just don\u2019t. If you\u2019re pregnant you can say you\u2019re nauseous the night of the dinner and just eat very little. But it\u2019s just basic manners when you\u2019re being hosted to pretend the food is good.

You can easily say, \"I am sorry X ingredient/dish is a huge aversion now that I am pregnant,\" because that is normal and reasonable, then just continue post pregnancy saying sorry, the food aversion stuck, but when you tell her you don't like her food at all and now that you're pregnant its completely intolerable, that is unkind and unnecessary. Your offer to teach her to make food from your culture is insult to injury because you made it clear she's not up to your expectations and your food is just better. \n\nMy MIL was/is a horrible cook and my husband is the first to say it. But we eat her food when she cooks and when we cook, she eats our food and acknowledges we're good cooks. She takes pointers and adapts her cooking for the better. My FIL reports her food is much better now that she's tried new things, mostly discovered through eating with us. You can softly influence someone or you can bludgeon them with nasty truth bombs... one will subtly improve your relationship and the other will result in you being an asshole!", "YTA - that was pretty rude.

Theres alot im confused about. Usually when its someone like an in law, how often can you really be expected to be eating food with them? Im assuming you dont meet THAT often. And honestly when it comes to food, its kind of easy to play it off by eating a little and then stopping. idk offering to teach her to cook may have offended her, especially when u say 'recipes from my homeland', its like the equivalent to u saying that their culture isnt as good as urs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand yes i also forgot to mention the pregnancy thing. thats a perfectly okay excuse as well.", "It sounds like you tried to do the right thing, but you couldn't.

YTA.", "YTA. You chose to marry a man from a different cultural background. That comes with acceptance of how they do things differently than yours.

Mayo?? \ud83d\ude31 \n\n\nBut you shouldn't have offered to teach her to cook. This is a topic that requires a lifetime of polite denial. You host because its too hard to travel with a baby and you ask her to bring desserts and drinks because her desserts are sooo good. And you pick 2-3 things she makes that you can tolerate and you just fall in love with them. \n\nBut now you're screwed because of your mother's insanely bad advice.

How would you feel if your guest told you \"oh, I can teach you to cook nice food without all those spices\"?", "YTA.\n\nIt would be one thing if you had a medical condition that caused you to be sick from some of the ingredients used by your MIL, such as gluten or dairy, and she insisted on making it anyway. But in your situation, you just don't like the taste. Telling her you don't like her food \\*IS\\* disrespectful and makes you sound spoiled.\n\nYou could have told her that your pregnancy is making you very ill and there are limited things you can currently manage to eat, so would she mind if you brought a dish of your own (to share, but also for you to eat). She's had children, she would understand that.", "Yta but you got exactly what you wanted, she'll never cook for your ungrateful ass again.", "YTA. This is exactly what you wanted right? She says she will never cook for you ever again and that\u2019s exactly what you seemed to want.

You could have easily went over ate very little using the pregnancy as an excuse if needed but instead you used it to be an asshole. I feel bad for your husband, by making that phone call you also disregarded his feelings, he was asking for one meal with his family, not a nightly thing. You made it so that he can never have a true family meal again because if he goes over there you, his wife are not invited and chances are if you invite his family for a meal at your place chances are his mother won't come. Good job!", "Honestly, this is not a hill I would die on. You just insulted your MIL and your husband just because it\u2019s not your personal preference. \nN T A for having preference\u2026 but you slid into AH territory for calling your MIL and insulting her cooking.   You could have begged off eating because of your pregnancy and suck it up when you\u2019re not sick. You don\u2019t have to like something to be polite. \n\nYTA", "Sorry YTA. You can suck up eating her food every now and then. Just a few bites while you're there and eat something else when you get home. And offering to teach her some of your recipes just comes off as condescending. You know there are people from other cultures that may find your food \"bad\" because if the way its seasoned. It may not be what you're used to but it's not like it would kill you to eat it.", "big YTA. there's being honest-- it sounds like a simple \"sorry, i don't actually like mayo\" at the next meal you have together would cover a lot of ground with the foods she makes for you... and then there's calling your MIL to tell her you don't like her cooking, but you can teach her to cook better. calling someone just to insult them is not okay.", "Honestly, NTA. \n\nI had a fil who looooved to cook. But that did Not mean he had Any talent for it.\n\nI\u2019m both a very polite and a very honest person. So when he asked me what I thought of his stew I asked him \u201cI should tell you if your son hasn\u2019t already: I will always tell you my honest opinion if you ask it of me no matter the subject. I\u2019ll be kind about it sure but it will be honest. Do you want my honest opinion or do you want the standard polite answer the masses give?\u201d\n\nHe blinked twice and told me to be honest. \n\nAgain I reminded him that I will be Honest so is he sure.\n\nHe was.\n\nSo I told him that while I admired his enthusiasm and his generosity in wanting to cook for and share with everyone, I didn\u2019t really like his food. \n\nHe was quiet for a moment then asked what it was that I didn\u2019t like because if he knew he could do better.\n\nWe ended up completely disappearing into our own little world discussing cooking in general, but most importantly Seasoning and the fact that there is a middle ground between \u2018 still moving on the plate bloody\u2019 and \u2018ashes from a cremation done\u2019.\n\nWe actually ended up going to a cooking class together. \n\nHonestly I miss him more than my ex lol.\n\nMy point, sorry for the novel, is that you should be able to be honest and not walk on eggshells\u2026 though if they are a Really messy cook then there is a chance of having to Literally walk on eggshells in the kitchen.", "ESH. Your MIL sucks at cooking, your husband sucks at being the mediator in this situation, your family sucks for the advice they gave you and you suck for calling and basically saying \"your cooking makes me sick\".", "Mayo on everything?  Just the thought of that makes me gag. I can imagine pregnancy makes it worse. \n\nThat said, next time just bring your own food.  I had to do that when I was pregnant.  Omg.  I lost so much weight my first semester due to throwing up.  It was horrible.  I couldn't handle seeing, or smelling, raw meat.\n\nYou should have blamed the pregnancy hormones.  People on a diet bring their own food.  Its okay for you to do that too.", "I was curious, so I googled tortilla pizza with mayo.  Consistent five star ratings.\n\nThe MAYO Clinic has a recipe for tortilla pizza\u2026ironic it has no mayo..", "Let look at this from the other side -\n\n\"I enjoy my MILs cooking and learning about the food from her culture so I thought she would like to try some of my cooking. I invited MIL over for dinner but she refused to eat any of it because she's *not accustomed to eating the type of foods I use to making and since she''s pregnant it'll be really hard for her to swallow because of her nausea, she even offered to teach me the recipes from her homeland that I seemed to really enjoy.\"*\n\nSee how that sounds?\n\nYTA\n\nETA - mayo as a base on pizza - I'll give you that one - that's gross and I LOVE mayo lol", "YTA. Listen, when we go to my in-laws, we end up eating like, junk food on junk food. I end up craving salads after about 24 hours. But I either eat something before they serve dinner so I take a little and oops, I'm already full! or I politely eat what I can. I might one day say like \"oh, I'm not a huge fan of steak,\" but I would never ever call them up to tell them that seemingly out of the blue. \n\nMorning sickness was a good enough excuse to pass on the food. I can't keep food down that I *like* most days. I promise you will never, ever change the way she makes pizza or pasta.", "Are you serious? YTA.\n\nEdit because this one really grinded my gears: Food and cooking are extremely personal to people. Maybe she puts mayo on pizza because that\u2019s what her parents did. It doesn\u2019t sound too appetizing, but it\u2019s how she likes things. \n\nYou had so many other options to go about addressing this issue, and you chose the most inconsiderate and disrespectful one. Bring salt, pepper, and any other seasoning packets with you if the food is so terrible you can\u2019t bear to eat it. Offer to help and hop in the kitchen while she\u2019s cooking, and add spices while you\u2019re assisting. Always bring over your own prepared dish that compliments whatever she\u2019s making. \n\nLook, my mom isn\u2019t the greatest cook, but I\u2019ll eat whatever she gives me because it\u2019s a labor of love and makes her feel good. I\u2019ve made a habit of cooking *with* her and she\u2019s gotten so much better and opened up to new cuisines. It\u2019s a fun activity we now share. \n\nDo some self-reflection. What would be your honest opinion if she were to call you and tell you your food is weird and that she can show you how to cook properly? I\u2019d imagine it wouldn\u2019t feel too good. \n\nIn summation, people that claim to be blunt often just lack social grace.", "NTA. Assuming you phrased it just like you wrote, that you\u2019re not accustomed to that type of food and that pregnancy is making it harder for you to eat food like that. I think that was a perfectly polite way to explain it to her, and the fact she blew up on you was incredibly inappropriate. I\u2019ll never understand why some people are so offended by truth \u2014 especially when the truth is over something so trivial. It\u2019s not like you told her you don\u2019t like her, you just don\u2019t want to eat her food.\nShe\u2019s definitely an over sensitive jerk in this case and your husband should be supporting you, not coddling his mother and treating her like a temperamental child. You shouldn\u2019t have to walk on eggshells your entire life because she can\u2019t function.", "ESh you and your husband. In one comment you say he doesn't like the food either. He should have talked to his mum additionally to say immediately to teach her dishes from your country (was a good thought) but sounds like her country is not as good as yours.", "YTA if the ethnicities  were flipped you'd also be the racist.", "NTA, sometimes people are gonna give us honesty we don't wanna hear. Not enjoying being told the truth doesn't make it asshole behaviour unless it was entirely unnecessary, and I think the band-aid might have needed to come off here eventually.", "Well you didn't say she cooks bad, only that you don't like this type of food and are coming from a different culture, this doesn't mean MIL is a bad cook so I don't understand why she got so furious, NTA", "Awkward for sure but NTA. Sounds like your MIL is a dreadful cook. She probably boils bacon.\n\nAt least you ripped the band-aid off and won't have to worry about eating her food for a while!", "I was gonna say YTA off the title but mayo in pizza? Ketchup instead of tomato sauce? \ud83d\ude31That is gross! NTA!", "NTA. Your MIL overreacted and is now pretending to be a victim. If one of my children\u2019s SO wanted to share their food and culture with me I would be excited about it.", "NTA. As much as people are opining that you had the perfect excuse to avoid eating her cooking by being pregnant, that's not really the point. A lifetime of curbing her hospitality is just as uncomfortable as telling her how you really feel about her cooking, and it avoids the bad faith of continuing to pretend.", "NTA\n\nEspecially when pregnant it is hard to forcefully eat something one doesn't like.", "NTA sounds like someone had to tell her, and it sounds like she knows considering how mad she got. You did it nicely so you're fine.", "NTA. I think the pregnancy excuse was perfect. You also said it as respectfully as you could. Your husband and MIL being so upset seems inconsiderate, you tried your best to tough it out and because you didn\u2019t want to keep lying you told her the truth and she got upset. It also seems like you guys spend a lot of time with your ILs so it would be hard to always say you\u2019ve eaten or not hungry. I\u2019m sure if there was a meal from your cultural food they didn\u2019t like they\u2019d have no issues telling you that.", "Unpopular opinion apparently but I think NTA. There's probably a cultural difference in levels of honesty or bluntness as well as the food, considering your husband didn't want you to say anything about it, but your family did. It kind of reminds me of a situation like, you meet someone and like them but they really love football and you don't. Do you pretend to love football too to seem like you have things in common so they like you more? My short answer, no, but it seems like a reasonable white lie for some in order to get what they want, which for you is peace with your MIL regarding meals. Once you've said those little white lies, there's only two results: either you pretend to love football (or weird Midwest-sounding cooking) for the rest of your life, or they find out you lied about it and they may be upset, but at least you don't have to pretend to like football anymore. You can't be pregnant forever and use that as an excuse to not eat; it's only delaying the inevitable. From what you've said, I think I'd hate her cooking too, just as much as I hate football. \n\nI don't think there was anything wrong with you telling her, but maybe you can take a few days to think and plan, get some advice from your husband on how his mom likes to be spoken to, and speak to her again about how the cultural differences in broaching a conversation like this may have insulted her in a way you didn't intend.", "Gently, ESH.  Although the food sounds disgusting (are they by chance from the midwest?) there are more polite ways of handling this and you definitely should have discussed it with your husband first.      And expecting your MIL to learn to make your dishes is rude; imagine if your husband offered to teach his in laws to make him ketchup-mayo smothered foods especially for him.  It\u2019s just rude.  \n\nBut you\u2019re pregnant and the MIL should have made accommodations without going nuclear.  Maybe meeting at a restaurant you all agree on, or suggesting you bring your own food.  Find solutions that don\u2019t revolve around catering to you.", "NTA but I feel sorry for your husband. Poor guy, wish I could take him out fishing for a day or two.", "NTA. Am I they only one here that wouldn\u2019t get offended if someone told me they didn\u2019t like my food. \n\nI understand that people can be really proud of their cooking but it\u2019s not that deep. People have preferences and they\u2019re not shameful secrets never to be divulged. I\u2019m not going to eat something I don\u2019t like to protect someone\u2019s feelings. I\u2019d be even more upset if I found out someone kept eating my food not liking a specific ingredient in it because they didn\u2019t want to offend me. You like what you like, it\u2019s ok not to like things.", "NTA\n\nAh yes the typical \"don't rock the boat\" attitude. And according to your husband you should pretend for the rest of your life together to like the food just to keep the peace? Honesty and communication is always the correct way as long as it's delivered in a tactful way. And by the sounds of it the food of your MIL really sounds terrible. \n\nIf your husband and your MIL like it, that's OK. If you don't like it and told it in a polite manner, which you did according to how you wrote it, that's also OK. You even made an attempt to make her learn your traditional food. Your MIL isn't obligated to say yes to that but you are also not obligated to like the food she makes.", "I\u2019m not going to say Y T A because I think this is probably a culture clash beyond just the food (blunt honesty versus white lies). If there\u2019s any way to salvage it at this point, I\u2019d blame it on the nausea and pregnancy hormones.", "AH would be a strong word.  I still can't get past this mayo pizza abomination.  I mean, yeah choke it down I guess, but your MIL needs to come to grips with the fact that she should be banned from the kitchen.", "NTA- You are allowed to be a picky eater. Just say that. The more excuses you try to make the more of an AH you become.", "It might be too late but I still say you guys should have a day of cooking and getting to know each other's cultures. Hopefully you guys can figure it out before your little one has arrived.\n\nIs there anything of hers that she makes that you do like? What about cooking together to make that?

She\u2019s a bully, isn\u2019t she? She talks down to you and treats you like trash? Is she a horrible MIL? \n\nI\u2019m going to assume yes, because that is the only justification to you and your family trashing her cooking behind her back, and you calling her and telling her what you did, and not just because you don\u2019t like it. Give me a happily ever after here, because I\u2019m all for destroying evil MILS. \n\nHow would you and your mother feel if he and his mother did that to you and your cooking? It wouldn\u2019t feel good, would it? \n\nIt takes nothing to be kind. Literally. But you refused to be kind\u2014even after your husband asked you to put up with it for ONE DAY\u2014and you just had to call her and be hurtful. \n\nAnd have you been pregnant the entire time you have been with him? Or have you been refusing to eat her food before you were pregnant? Because if you have been, you using your pregnancy excuse NOW just makes you look like an even bigger AH. And not only that, but for some reason, you had to add insult to injury by offering to teach her how to cook your foods. I can\u2019t even wrap my head around that. \n\nSo now what? \n\nYou have hurt his mother, and disappointed your husband, and now, she refuses to cook anything else for you, and everyone is unhappy.\n\nWas it worth it? \n\nMaybe I\u2019m missing something here. I can be slow like that, but if someone had called MY mother and told her her food was pretty much gross, someone would be getting wrecked. Just like I\u2019m assuming you would wreck someone if they insulted YOUR mother.\n\nMaybe we were taught differently by our mothers, but mine taught me to always, ALWAYS, treat people how I want them to treat me, because what I put out to the universe, will come back upon me, threefold. If the food was gross, I would smile and pretend it was the best thing in the world because again, it takes nothing to be kind. \n\nAnyways, I hope you can apologize because your mother was right about one thing: you will have to deal with this woman for the rest of your life, you know, the grandmother to your child?
