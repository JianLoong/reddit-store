I would laugh my ass off at those neighbors. \n\nI made a very private backyard so I can sunbathe topless by the pool and nobody can see me.

I'm a big fat old bastard and I make no secret of the fact that I enjoy gardening in the nude. I do have good, tall fences & hedges around my property which keep my garden 75% hidden.

It is 100% the onlookers job to make it so that they cannot see you.

If they are uncomfortable seeing you then they should make it so that they cannot see you.", "NTA... I laughed as I imagined trying to get a bathing suit over a belly with a child at 8 months.

A pool is a brilliant way to relieve the stresses on your body.", "NTA\n\nThey'll probably be the sort of neighbours that will ask you not to breastfeed while sitting outside because they are offended.\n\nThey need to grow up and get over it - babies don't come from a cabbage patch, or brought down by a stork.\n\nGood luck - enjoy floating in the pool for the next month.", "NTA.
