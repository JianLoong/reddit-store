She makes it a big part of her personality, she practically introduces herself: \"Hi, I'm Sara, I hate celery and beetroot\". Except of these two things and broth she isn't a picky eater at all, so nobody is making a big deal out of that. \n\nIn the last few months my sister was repeatedly buying hummus... with beetroot... and using it on her sandwiches. I called her on that, asking why does she lie about hating beetroots when in reality she eats them daily. She told me that she still hates beetroots but their taste is not noticeable in hummus and that she thinks eating them in small portions is healthy for her as they contain iron (she recently had problems with anemy). I let it go, even though I still thought that it was weird. Also, I tried this hummus of hers and yes, the beetroots *were* clearly noticeable in taste. (Also, sometimes she adds celery to tomato juice when she tries to be on diet, 'cause she thinks it helps losing weight, so I think her \"disliking\" these foods is just a pose.)\n\nFast forward, on weekend our family visited my aunt and uncle (dad's brother's family) for dinner. Aunt made a roast with beetroots but told Sara that specifically for her she also had made a bit of another dish, so she doesn't need to eat them. Sara thanked our aunt but I thought that it is unfair that she had additional work even though my sister only pretends to hate beetroots. So I told my aunt openly that I saw Sara eating beetroots and she shouldn't worry too much since she is alright with eating them. \n\nEverybody got very silent and Sara was nervous and started saying that I'm lying. I called her on her beetroot hummus and she tried to tell me that it's not the same but for some time the mood during the dinner was very awkward. \n\nSara and my mum are really mad at me and say that I purposefully tried to make my sister look bad. My dad is on my side and says that she should get over her fussing anyway. I didn't try to make her look bad, I only thought that it's unfair that the aunt made a different dish for her, even though she's only lying to make herself look more inteesting.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671635112, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zrplit/aita_for_exposing_my_sisters_lie_making_her_look/", "score": 538, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Odd things to base one's personality around but ultimately two foods that aren't super common in most dishes and usually treated as optional add-ons as opposed to being core staples. Like if Sara had been pretending she didn't like garlic or onion when she actually did, I can see how that would be a little more frustrating to deal with growing up.\n\nBut shaming her in front of your family for something so silly is just as asinine behaviour as her building a personality around a very normalised aversion to two uncommon foods (especially as it sounds like it's a texture thing not a taste thing for her).", "YTA How sad is it that you that you think a person disliking two vegetables makes them interesting? That is your standard of interesting?

The texture makes me gag. But I got served freshly pulled from the garden and then roasted beetroot and yeah, they're pretty tasty because it's a different texture and it doesn't make me wanna vomit. \n\nMaybe just try not being a dick about it? Would give you a lot more peace just ignoring what she chooses to eat. It literally does not effect you in the slightest. If it does, it's because you are (for some unknown reason) allowing it to bother you. It's weird.", "YTA but also everything about this is super weird.

Its hardly very interesting. \n\nYou also dont seem to understand how tastebuds and dietary preferences work. \n\n\n>She told me that she still hates beetroots but their taste is not noticeable in hummus\n\nIts entirely normal to like something in one context and not another, especially blended into something like hummus. Just because you thought it was noticeable doesnt mean she does. \n\n>she thinks eating them in small portions is healthy for her as they contain iron (she recently had problems with anemy).\n\n>sometimes she adds celery to tomato juice when she tries to be on diet, 'cause she thinks it helps losing weight,\n\nAgain, entirely normal for people to eat things they would normallg avoid for health reasons.
