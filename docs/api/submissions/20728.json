Can people legitimately train a service dog themselves? Yes, service dogs aren\u2019t just for physical disabilities, but can be for things like PTSD\u2026 but it\u2019s the rare person who can do so. Your SIL better get used to people asking her what service her dog is trained to perform, because that is one of the only two legal questions people can ask about arrive dogs:\n1. Is this a service dog?\n2. What service does the dog perform?\n\nAnd you are correct that this is a safety question for accommodation purposes. Imagine not knowing why a service dog is barking when their owner is having a panic attack or a seizure or headed into a diabetic issue. This is why it\u2019s legal to ask what the service is. Your SIL is clearly being defensive because her dog is not a legitimate service dog. Otherwise she would happily answer the question.", "There are no legit service dogs you train yourself, as far as I know. Which is likely why she's touchy about the subject.", "Her friends are messaging you? Weird. I hope you\u2019re telling them to f\u2019 right off. \n\nThe \u201cservice dog\u201d schtick is incredibly dodgy and sounds like a load of attention seeking nonsense. It seems that lately a disability is a bit of social currency, and a service dog? That\u2019s a \u201clike\u201d machine. So yeah, keep asking those questions, loud, and in public. Where the dog was trained and for what disability shouldn\u2019t be an issue for someone with an honest need.", "All I know is Nobody messes with my Service Lobster  \ud83e\udd9e!", "NTA. From reading this post, it sounds like she\u2019s one of those folks who saw the relatively new emotional support animal accommodations and decided to abuse that system to their own advantage, giving a bad reputation to those who have a true need for such accommodations.

Id suggest just giving them time to cool off.", "NTA. It is generally considered rude to ask people why they need any kind of aid including service dogs and she had every right to decline to answer you, however it seems like you had only the best of intentions. It\u2019s a touchy subject for a lot of people, but it was absolutely inappropriate for her friends to bother you over it.\n Contrary to what lots of people are saying, service dogs can absolutely be trained by their owners, it\u2019s completely legal. Many people opt to train their own dogs if they can since it\u2019s much cheaper.", "NTA. It is a legitimate question to ask of a family member.  It is unusual for family members to be totally unaware of problems that would necessitate a service animal.

You say she is hostile and rude with you for no reason. Then you say you are only asking about her disability so that you can accommodate her better... Accommodate/support her how? Is there an event you are hosting that you wanted to prepare for? YOr did you just want to know in general? For accommodating/supporting her \"in general\"? Because that just sounds fishy to me, sorry. You have never had a friendship or be close so saying you want to support her in her disability sounds insincere. Like you are trying to think of a thoughtful excuse to be nosy. Nothing inherently assholish about being curious/nosy unless there is a history of SIL feeling judged by you.   \n\n\nBut even with the way you are carefully wording this post makes it sound like you *could be\\** judgmental in a passive-aggressive way towards her. She sounds like she *could be\\** the stereotypical girl with CPTSD who wants to train an emotional support animal (which are $$$ out of reach for average people) to help her deal with crippling anxiety issues. I have a lot of experience with people like  that, and I know that they can be hyper vigilant towards perceived judgment and rejection. And then you call up, when you're not exactly friendly, and say \"Hey, just wondered what the disability is-- so that I can support you and accommodate you better\" I would absolutely feel like you were being a passive aggressive, judgmental in-law who didn't actually have my best interest at heart, but wanted to snark about me...\n\nBut I don't know.

Service dogs can also be owner trained or trained by foster parents. There\u2019s a little old lady in our neighborhood that fosters future service dogs.

Whether what she's doing is legal or not idk but that's her problem not yours.", "It's not a real service dog if she's training it herself.

So from her pov you are already the annoying kid who wouldn't get the hint and leave her alone but she can't say anything bc she is dating your brother :) so she was maybe scared with what other nice and friendly accommodations, she never asked for, you will come up now.

She went into AH territory though for getting her friends involved.

There used to be a poster with the screen name \"Clumber\" whose service dog learned by imitating another dog.", "I have PTSD and found a service dog to be out of my price range.  I did get a dog from the shelter but I had no idea I could train her to help with my PTSD myself.  Any resources I should connect to to learn how to do this?  She is an Akita and Bloodhound mix so extremely intelligent and has been easy to train on anything I\u2019ve taught her so far.", "This my sd was attacked because of someone doing This", "Screen shot those post and send them as a response to her friends", "Yikes \ud83d\ude2c", "Strangers or coworkers sure. But if a family member asked, in response to you mentioning having a disability, when they had never heard of it until now?", "What if it\u2019s PTSD though? That\u2019s a common reason people have service dogs that many people don\u2019t like talking about. \n\nIdk my read is that she probably doesn\u2019t trust you because she perceives you as a negative towards her life partner and is therefore cagey to give you any personal information about herself.", "Do they have to be certified cause anyone could say any dog was a service dog and then there is vicious and ill mannered dogs being allowed everyone in public?", "Again the largest service dog organization in the country where Bush Sr., got his dog from, meaning I live in the US, and the location of the training facility is here on Long Island in Smithtown, where they also train dogs for veterans.", "most dog owners cant even train their dogs to be pets I really dont trust people to train them to be service dogs.", "No certification for service dogs. They can be owner trained.\nHowever, a service dog must behave in public. If someone claiming to have a service dog is in a store, and the dog is being loud (barking for reasons other than alerting to a medical issue), a nuisance, making messes or being aggressive, the store has every right to ask them to leave.", "Nope. There's no service dog certification in the US.", "Yes, and in the US service dogs can also be trained by their handlers themselves. Legally, the dogs don\u2019t have to be directly trained by professionals.", "Laws vary by country but speaking specifically on the US laws, service animals can be kicked out for misbehaving, being out of control, disruptive, going potty where they shouldn\u2019t be, or otherwise being a safety risk. So if someone brings a dog that they claim is a service animal, and even if it does do tasks, a business can still kick the animal out if it\u2019s not completely under control and behaving itself the entire time while there. \n\nAnd while I definitely agree that most pet owners unfortunately don\u2019t train their pets properly, I will however say that speaking from personal experience as a service dog handler the vast majority of service dogs I\u2019ve met that have also been owner trained are extremely well behaved and well trained as they should be. A lot of handlers who owner train also tend to go above and beyond what is required by law regarding the dogs training.", "It embarrasses me when my SD gets spooked and let\u2019s out a single bark idk how these people are ok with their \u201cservice dogs\u201d acting like that", "That\u2019s just frightening"]}
