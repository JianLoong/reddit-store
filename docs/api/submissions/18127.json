{"id": 18127, "submission_id": "13re0t3", "title": "AITA for telling my sister she needs to pay for child care or I'm not going to her wedding?", "selftext": "My (f25) sister's wedding (F28) is in a couple months. She recently sent out inventions. I was invited as a regular guest, not a brides maid or MOH since we live a state apart and obviously there's a certain level of involvement and time that goes into being part of a bridal party, which I understand. \n\nI want to be there for my sister and obviously I'd like to see her get married. \n\nBut the problem is... I'm a single Mom. My son is 6 and when he's not at school I need to be home watching him. So being out for hours at a time isn't really in the cards for me right now. My sister's wedding is child free. \n\nSince it's taking place in her state, I'd need to commute, and I'd probably have to be gone from my house for 2 full days. I can't have family watch my son since they'll all be at the wedding. And I don't really have friends who will babysit for 2 days. \n\nI contacted my sister and asked if she'd be willing to let my son come to the wedding with me, and explained he couldn't be left alone so young and that I didn't have anyone to watch him. She responded by telling me her \"no children\" policy was strict and she wouldn't make exceptions. \n\nI explained my situation again, and said I'd need some form of child care or to bring him with me. I then asked her if she would pay me to hire a nanny or babysitter to watch him. She got offended, and said \"children and weddings are both parts of life\" and I need to \"just figure it out, it's my kid, my problem.\" Which sure that's true, but also... her wedding, her making it a problem by not allowing me to bring my kid.\n\nI told her she could either pay for my child care or I wouldn't be going to her wedding. Which all she did was call me \"ridiculous\" and \"entitled.\" She said she shouldn't have to pay for my child and that part of being an adult is knowing how to take care of that kind of thing. \n\nI think that's ridiculous. Money is tight. Child care is expensive. I can't magically afford for someone to watch my 6 year old and most people would just let me bring him to the wedding. \n\nMy sister says she's definitely not paying for child care, and \"I guess you're not going to the wedding then.\" My whole family is mad at me for \"not being there for my sister.\" \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I think some people are misunderstanding the post so I'll be more clear. I'm not trying to force my sister to pay for anything, and it's totally fine if I can't come, she accepts that, and I just don't go. It only became a problem when my entire family came after me for not going to the wedding. I'm not mad at my sister for not paying. I'm mad at her for turning the family against me and saying \"(me) doesn't want to come to the wedding\" and complaining about me behind my back to my parents. She complained about me not going to the wedding as if I was purposely avoiding it.", "created_utc": 1685010517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13re0t3/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_needs_to_pay_for/", "score": 8750, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get where you\u2019re coming from, but you went about this all wrong.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s not within my budget to travel so far and also arrange to pay for child care when I get there.  I send my best.\u201d Full stop.  Don\u2019t ask for handouts from a stressed out bride.  Is that what people do?  Good lord.  If she\u2019s gracious she or the family will offer a solution.  But you don\u2019t ask for that.  That\u2019s where the entitlement came from.  In the end the kid is your responsibility, no one else\u2019s.", "YTA. It's no one else's responsibility to pay for your childcare. Completely unreasonable ask", "YTA. I've never heard of a bride/groom being expected to pay for a guest's childcare. What nonsense.", "YTA,. You could have just just politely declined the invite. Your kid, your problem.", "YTA - you would have been justified in declining but assuming its your sister\u2019s responsibility to pay and asking makes you an AH. Childfree weddings most certainly are a thing and this is your kid, so its your responsibility.", "It s ok to expose your concern but i think you went too far when asking her to pay.", "YTA. Your sister can have a child free wedding if she wants, and it's incredibly entitled to ask her to bend the rules for you, or to pay your childcare costs.\n\nIf she then has a go at you for not attending, she's being TA too, but otherwise a straight \"unfortunately I can't afford childcare so I'll have to skip it\" would have sufficed.", "YTA. \n\nYou don't ask your sister to pay for your childcare. You ask your sister if she knows anyone in her town who babysits. Or you get on care.com and look for a babysitter in her town. \n\nChild free weddings aren't uncommon. And she's right, this is part of being a parent. If you truly can't afford a babysitter for a few hours, then you'll have to miss the wedding. But you really should try to prioritize this.", "YTA for your request to have her pay for your childcare and being upset she said no. She has zero obligation to your child. It\u2019s her wedding day, she can set the rules as she wants. However, if it\u2019s not possible for you to attend then it simply isn\u2019t. Yeah more empathy from your sister would be nice. But if no childcare = no wedding, then that\u2019s just a fact.", "YTA\n\nshe can make the wedding child free, and she is probably spending a lot on it so it\u2019s not like there\u2019s leftover money for peoples kids.  You can\u2019t go then, don\u2019t make it their problem or guilt trip them", "YTA... but honestly I do see where you are coming from.  I think the basic situation is that if you cannot afford the childcare to go to a wedding you should just cordially tell her you are really sorry but you cannot get anyone to look after your child and therefore you can't go.    \nI would not have gone and given an ultimatum, i would have explained the situation and said I cannot go as i have no child care and see if she offered anything to me, if she hadn't i would have conceded to myself that i would not be able to go.\n\nI think that would have been a better way to handle it.", "ESH\n\nShe is correct, it is your child so it\u2019s your responsibility to find and pay for child care. Asking her to pay IS entitled. \n\nLikewise, when she decided to have a child free wedding she did so knowing that some people might not be able to come, so she needs to graciously accept your RSVP of not attending and not get upset about it.", "I\u2019d just decline and say childcare isn\u2019t in your finances now as a single mother and you wish her the best.

That\u2019s how you\u2019ve \u201cfigured it out\u201d. Not attending is a valid solution to this problem.

If you can\u2019t afford it or aren\u2019t comfortable leaving your kid with a sitter for two whole days, you can\u2019t go. That\u2019s the rules she made.

She wants a childfree wedding and you can\u2019t afford to have your kid be watched, so the answer is that you don\u2019t go. I think she could have helped, but I also don\u2019t really think she\u2019s obligated to.", "YTA for demanding that she pay for your childcare.  I'm sure she's been engaged for some time and you could have used that time to save money.  It's too bad that you don't seem to have arranged any regular childcare to even be out for an evening, let alone multiple days, but that's on you.", "On 1 hand your problem is a major 1 and needs addresses. On the other hand jumping straight to her paying for a nanny was wrong. You would have been better served simply telling your sis that your sorry but you wont be able to go if there isnt some kind of arrangements for children as you cannot afford a babysitter for 2 days. You could tell her that any ideas are welcome but you just dont see how it is feasible for you to afford it at this time.", "ESH/NAH   \nThis all comes down to how you communicate. \"*I would love to come and support my sister, but I cannot afford childcare for two days*\". Everyone in your family should be able to understand this, including your sister. \n\nHow is your relationship with your sister normally? Do you live far apart? Where does your parents live, and how much time do they spend with you son?Does he have a close friend from school he can stay with?", "I think you should have phrased it \" If you want me to attend, you will need to provide childcare\"\n\nBut no if you can't afford it, then you can't afford  it and you shouldn't go.  \n\nJust tell her that you can't attend for those reasons and you will attend her next one when your son is older.", "NAH\n\nYour sister can have the wedding she wants but she needs to know that has consequences, she knows you\u2019re a single parent with no other child care, what did she think you were going to do? I can\u2019t imagine leaving my nephews and niece out of my wedding", "YTA- you are overwhelmed and stressed and you are not thinking clearly. For some reason you don't want to go to your sister's wedding and maybe you are even a little jealous. Can't you stay at your parent's home and pay a friend of the family to watch your kid or something like that.", "YTA. It's months away and you can't figure out a solution in that amount of time?\nTake the kid with you, hire someone so you can be at the ceremony and dinner, leave after dinner. Hundred bucks tops and everyone's happy.", "NAH, if she is adamant about not bringing kids to the wedding and you don't want to talk me a financial hit to attend then not going to the wedding seems a reasonable outcome. You're both going into AH territory by getting angry at each other and the rest of your family should mind their own business unless they can help you attend.", "You are stuck between a rock and a hard place... which is exactly what you need to say to your family.    \nTell them that instead of being mad... come up with solutions.", "YTA your kid, your problem. Do you expect the bride n groom to pay for everyone's problems? Some might have old people to look after, some might get pay deducted for absence and some might have extra travel requirements.", "YTA What about the option to take the child with you and look for a babysitter there?", "NTA. She is right, your child, your problem, your circumstances dictate that the only solution is staying with him as all other alternatives she has rejected so your problem, your solution and if she doesn't like it that's her problem.", "[removed]", "YTA. You\u2019re not wrong for saying you can\u2019t go because of your child. It makes perfect sense that you can\u2019t just leave a six year old, but you are the AH for asking her to pay for childcare. Childcare is your responsibility, not hers. That\u2019s like asking someone with a destination wedding to pay for travel costs. If she wants to help you, she can do that. I would make an exception for my sister, but ultimately it\u2019s her choice. Your sister has decided she wants a childfree wedding and that\u2019s perfectly valid. She\u2019ll have to deal with the consequences of people dropping out if they can\u2019t get a babysitter. If you can\u2019t attend because of the cost, that\u2019s valid too, so just say that. \u201cI\u2019d love to, but I just can\u2019t because I can\u2019t arrange or afford childcare for two whole days. Family who would normally help will all be at the wedding.\u201d And your family are also AH for badgering you about not being able to go.", "NTA. Your family shouldn't be making you feel bad, if you can't afford to have someone watch your son that's just how it is.\n\nIt's also wrong of her to complain to the family about you not coming when she chose to make the wedding childfree.", "ESH, your sister\u2019s wedding is child free. It\u2019s her decision. You asked for an exception; she said no. That should have been the end of the discussion. Continuing to ask her for help is unreasonable, she\u2019s planning a wedding; she obviously didn\u2019t think or doesn\u2019t want to arrange childcare on top of wedding planning. That\u2019s cool. Her wedding. However, the rest of your family guilt tripping you for not coming is over the top. Child free weddings are allowed. But it comes with consequences; one of those consequences is that people with kids sometimes can\u2019t attend. As is said countless times; an invitation is not a summons.", "Well, I guess you aren\u2019t going to the wedding, then. \n\nYou can\u2019t afford to pay for childcare, and anybody that would do it for free will be at the wedding. If your sister really really wants you there, she could bend a little. But she isn\u2019t willing to do that\u2026 so\u2026 you just don\u2019t go.\n\nDon\u2019t let anybody make you feel guilty. You have responsibilities. Your sister has a *want*. And we don\u2019t always *get* what we want. NTA", "Uggh i really hate all the fuss about weddings. ETA you for asking her to pay for childcare and her/family for expecting you to just have a magical childcare solution. she invited you she doesn't want kids there. You don't have child care so you can't go there's no need to make a song and dance about it. Just reply to the invite saying I'm sorry but I can't make it and that is the end of the issue. Yes it suck you won't beable to attend your sisters wedding but sometimes that's just how things go.", "NTA. \nEveryone is entitled to a childfree wedding if they desire. However, if you have a childfree wedding you've gotta accept it's not feasible for some parents to attend. So goes life. Op literally said her only options are getting a sitter, making an exception, or not attending. A sitter for 2 days and 1-2 nights is very expensive. The sister isn't budging on making an exception for her nephew. So that leaves OP with not being able to attend. If the sister is still insisting on OP attending and not compromising, she can pay for childcare or make an exception. It's that simple.", "NTA. You can't figure out the childcare, so, being a responsible mother, you can't go to the wedding. The family that is mad for you \"not being there for your sister\" has to understand that you simply don't have the money. What, do they also berate you for not having the money in other situations? That's ridiculous.", "NTA. You have been forced to make a choice between your 6 year old child and a 28 year old sister who is acting like one. Easy call.", "NTA.\n\nBut brides, grooms and other wedding planners have to expect that if you make a wedding child free (or destination etc) some people you really wanted to come simply won't be able to.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve been petty and told her to pay for it too. First of all, can\u2019t imagine not allowing my nephew at my wedding. I would absolutely arrange for someone to pick the kid up once the party started. \n\nMy sister got married and she invited my in-laws. They helped watch my kids (her ring bearer and flower girl) and then took them home when the drinking began. My kids were a huge part of her day and the only kids who were invited. But honestly, if someone else needed child care, we would\u2019ve figure it out too. Why are families so fucking terrible to each other?", "NAH- Unfortunate.", "NAH She's allowed to have a child free wedding and you're allowed to decline. Stay home, send a nice card and gift.", "NTA. As a parent you have priorities. If she can\u2019t respect that then too bad.", "Esh - you can\u2019t expect her to pay for your child\u2019s care. She can\u2019t expect a parent with no support to come to a child free wedding", "NTA. But considering your family is mad at you, why don't you ask if they can then help out by each stepping away from the wedding for a half hour or hour to help watch him? That would get you through the ceremony and reception and that is really the only time you need help with child care.", "Absolutely YTA.   Can't even afford to pay childcare for 2 days. Glad your sister said \"I guess you're not going to the wedding then.\"", "NTA\n\nYou tried to reason with her. She didn't budge. So don't go.\n\nThis child free no exceptions!! trend is disgusting.", "ESH.  Your childcare is not your sister's problem.  But then, your family pressuring you to go to the wedding without your son is ridiculous.  \n\nIt's OK to have a childfree wedding.  But if your sister has a young child, you can't expect your sister to travel without him.  At the same time, your sister is in no way, shape or form responsible for childcare for your son.\n\nThere is no logical middle ground here.  Everybody is being unreasonable.  \n\nI'd probably play it this way.  Travel with kiddo.  Find a baby-sitter near the wedding to watch him during the wedding.   That seems the best approach, as you wouldn't need a baby-sitter for two days...just a span of several hours.", "YTA. Other people don\u2019t pay for your childcare. \n\nBut it\u2019s fair for you to decline to go because you are a single mother and can\u2019t find anyone to babysit or can\u2019t afford to pay.  She won\u2019t be happy but that\u2019s part of the issue with a child-free wedding, which is entirely fine for her to have.

Money is tight.\n\nYou....  you think it's ridiculous that you're expected to be responsible for your own child?   What?  \n\nIf money is tight, that's your own issue.  Don't go to the wedding if you can't afford it, ***but own it as your own decision***.  It is not her fault that you're not a responsible parent that has backup babysitting options lined up.   \n\nI'm glad your sister has a spine. \n\nParents that act like this are the worst.  No one else owes you anything because you decided to have children.   It's all entirely your own issue to solve, and don't toss the blame on anyone but your own lack of planning.", "YTA. You could have asked for help in finding childcare during the wedding. At your own expense. Or ask her to put you in contact with other trusted parents who already have childcare lined up, maybe they and the babysitter would be willing to share for a low cost.", "NTA.\n\nYou do not have the means to attend her wedding. You\u2019ve let her know, and you\u2019ve let her know why. \n\nWhile sorting out childcare is not her responsibility, it\u2019s equally not her place to be angry at you over not being able to attend her event.", "Info: did you try at all to find a solution? Is there any family nearby with teenagers that also won\u2019t be attending and could babysit? Or other guests that will also need a babysitter you could split the cost with?", "Could you not go with your son to the wedding, and hire a baby sitter to look after the child for the ceremony and party afterwards? I assume you would stay at the hotel / resort where the wedding is at so you could check in during the day with him, but he wouldn\u2019t be around the wedding party. You would have the best of both then. Or is a \u2018child free wedding\u2019 an entire weekend where children are out of sight?", "Just curious as to what the issue is if you have mos to prepare and mos to find a solution on childcare? You can take your son with you and find someone in her area that specializes in childcare, perhaps like a day care? One that can have an overnight stay?  Yea it will probably cost you a couple hundred extra but you have time to save no?", "NTA\n\nIf she excludes kids she has to understand that one of the consequences might be excluding parents, usually the mother, of young kids. Which it sounds like she does understand... hard to say, did she say \"I guess you're not coming to the wedding\" in a snarky, or sad sort of way? If she was snippy about it she is an asshole, if she was sad and regretful she is not. The relatives who are guilt tripping you are definitely assholes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the asking for money thing, I dunno, in my family we hit each other up for money all the time. I just asked my mom to cover the cost of my tax filing because it requires an American credit card, which, not living in America, I don't have. I'll make it up with groceries when I visit her, or I will take her out to dinner or spot her when she forgets her credit card or whatever, it will even out.", "NTA ... because somehow your family got into guilt tripping you after you said you can't afford to come. Would have said n a h otherwise.", "YTAH! She is right your child your responsibility she shouldn\u2019t have to pay for you, if she pays for you child\u2019s care then she has to pay for others.

Explained your problem and asked if they could look after the kid or help with care?

You can't expect that your sister pays for the babysitter, while also paying for you to be at the wedding. Also: child-free weddings? That is a weird thing for me, particularly when the child in question is your niece of nephew. And if your family is so angry, they can offer to babysit in turns so you can all catch some of the wedding.", "NTA but as she said, your kid, your problem and you have stated, no kid, I won't be there. Looks like you have made up your mind and your list of priorities. As she said children and weddings are part of life and you choose one over the other. The whole family isn't there for you when you need them the most but are happy to take sides with the sister. Its not fair on you but if they can't be depended upon, might as well not bother how they feel.", "NTA - That's literally her nephew, seems to be selective with which family members she wants to attend!\n\nI'd say that you'd love to attend but unfortunately you don't have the availability to attend and send a card/gift.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust as an option - is there someone who could babysit in your sister's state? Then you could to the ceremony, etc. and only have to get someone to babysit for the time you're at the ceremony?", "Send her invention back.", "ESH \n\nYour family is being ridiculous and failing to understand your situation.\n\nI would have said you weren't the asshole till you gave your sister the option of paying for your childcare? \n\nIt's easy just show a little grace and say \"thanks for the invite but the situation is untenable due to your child free stance and my inability to get childcare, I wish you all the best\"\n\nNo you decided that since you're being burdened then your sister should be burdened too.\n\nNo one here looks good.", "YTA,\n\nlike you sister said your child your problem and if you can't understand that then just don't go.\n\nchild care can be expensive understandable but you can't expect others to pay for your child.", "She invited to her wedding. If you can't go, you can't go, it's not her job to pay for your kid. YTA for implying that.", "YTA.  She doesn't owe you anything and you are quite wrong that others would include him. Don't go and distance yourself from your family for good.", "YTA \n\n>I told her she could either pay for my child care or I wouldn't be going to her wedding\n\nThis does reek of entitlement and expecting someone else to cover your responsibility. If you'd simply declined the invitation because you can't afford child care, that would be understandable. Making a demand like that was over the line.\n\n>My whole family is mad at me for \"not being there for my sister.\"\n\nThey suck, too. If you can't afford it, you can't afford it.", "YTA. \n\nYou can\u2019t go, she said ok.

Now you\u2019re kicking up drama and trying to blame it on your sister.", "YTA\nIf you can't arrange your own child care, or it's outside of your budget, or you just don't want to, just say that. It's no one else's responsibility though. If it were me, I think I would have to like ask a friend to travel with me to babysit for me, possibly then having to pay them for babysitting services as I wouldn't want a stranger watching my kid. But it seems like you're okay with that since you want her to arrange childcare, so since you're okay with a stranger watching your kid just hire a babysitting service once you get there?", "YTA. In what world is it your sister\u2019s responsibility to pay for your babysitter?  Absolutely ridiculous.", "YTA. Come on. She\u2019s allowed to say no kids.\nYou\u2019re allowed to not go. But this demand is so unreasonable and selfish", "Yeah YTA for gojng about it this way. Now had this been a response to her getting upset at you rsvp'ing no, that would have been different. But it wasn't, you initiated it almost straight away. I'm sorry, but that's ridiculous. He's your child. Not hers. I get that you want to be there for your sister, but not having childcare is a very good reason to not go.

She recently sent out inventions. I was invited as a regular guest, not a brides maid or MOH since we live a state apart and obviously there's a certain level of involvement and time that goes into being part of a bridal party, which I understand. \n\nI want to be there for my sister and obviously I'd like to see her get married. \n\nBut the problem is... I'm a single Mom. My son is 6 and when he's not at school I need to be home watching him. So being out for hours at a time isn't really in the cards for me right now. My sister's wedding is child free. \n\nSince it's taking place in her state, I'd need to commute, and I'd probably have to be gone from my house for 2 full days. I can't have family watch my son since they'll all be at the wedding. And I don't really have friends who will babysit for 2 days. \n\nI contacted my sister and asked if she'd be willing to let my son come to the wedding with me, and explained he couldn't be left alone so young and that I didn't have anyone to watch him. She responded by telling me her \"no children\" policy was strict and she wouldn't make exceptions. \n\nI explained my situation again, and said I'd need some form of child care or to bring him with me. I then asked her if she would pay me to hire a nanny or babysitter to watch him. She got offended, and said \"children and weddings are both parts of life\" and I need to \"just figure it out, it's my kid, my problem.\" Which sure that's true, but also... her wedding, her making it a problem by not allowing me to bring my kid.\n\nI told her she could either pay for my child care or I wouldn't be going to my wedding. Which all she did was call me \"ridiculous\" and \"entitled.\" She said she shouldn't have to pay for my child and that part of being an adult is knowing how to take care of that kind of thing. \n\nI think that's ridiculous. Money is tight. Child care is expensive. I can't magically afford for someone to watch my 6 year old and most people would just let me bring him to the wedding. \n\nMy sister says she's definitely not paying for child care, and \"I guess you're not going to the wedding then.\" My whole family is mad at me for \"not being there for my sister.\" \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "ESH Your sister is allowed to make her wedding child free.  It is then the responsibility of any parent invited to the wedding to find childcare if they plan to attend.  That is NOT the bride's responsibility.  So she is correct that you were out of line to ask her to pay for your child's care in order to attend. She's right to be upset you ever asked. \n\nHowever, in making her wedding child free, she also had to accept that some people will choose to or not be able to attend. That's just how it goes and she doesn't get to believe every parent is magically going to have childcare lined up to attend her wedding. Each parent gets to make that decision for themselves and their family.", "I\u2019m gonna go and say NAH. \n\nIdk why everyone feels so strongly about YTA. If my sister was in this position, regardless of what my original plan was, I\u2019d absolutely let my nephew come. I\u2019m getting married in September, and how I view a wedding is\u2026 I want everyone to enjoy the moment and feel their best and just have fun? I want my marriage experience to be where people see the love between my husband and I and our commitment to being kind to others and doing what we can for those we love. I understand everyone views weddings differently.  \n\nYou\u2019re asking a lot of people to be part of your wedding day, they make many accommodations to be there and it is expensive, it\u2019s okay to make accommodations for them.

And truly, if for some reason I didn\u2019t want my nephew to come (I couldn\u2019t imagine) and my sister was in a tight spot, I\u2019d absolutely help her. No question. I\u2019m sorry you are in a position where money is tight, that must must be stressful on top of being a single mom. Have a fun weekend with your son instead!

And then you expect her to pay for someone to watch your kid??? Whoa. Lady, check yourself. Who exactly do you think you are? Here's an idea (it's probably too late now since your whole family is rightfully peeved at your attitude), how about you contact your parents and say hey listen I really want to go support Sister but I'm in a bind.

It was OP that pushed.  \n\nThe sister did exactly what you said the sister should do.  \n\n>  A sitter for 2 days and 1-2 nights is very expensive. \n\nThere's obvious solutions for this.  The kid comes on the trip, the parents of different kids coordinate in advance to pool money for a babysitter, and the cost is much much lower because it's for only a few hours instead of a few days.  \n\n> The sister isn't budging on making an exception for her nephew. So that leaves OP with not being able to attend. \n\nYes, that's what the sister said.  OP argued back.  Why is the sister the one in the wrong when OP is the one that kept not accepting the answer?  The sister did everything you say.  \n\n> If the sister is still insisting on OP attending and not compromising, she can pay for childcare or make an exception. \n\nWhy?   You directly said to accept that someone isn't coming if they can't.  The sister did that.

It\u2019s completely unreasonable to leave a child that young for that long and her sister knows that all their close family and friends will be at the wedding.

Like I get wanting a child free wedding, but most people will make an exception for guests that they want there that would not be able to attend. I'm going to go with everyone's the asshole. The sister for not having any consideration for her single mother sister, and the sister for even asking to provide childcare help. You don't ask the bride that while she's planning and prepping for a wedding.", "I think maybe perspectives are different for people who are older when they get married. I was 29 when my sister got married and 31 when I got married. We were all kind of over the whole Disney princess fantasy promulgated by the wedding industrial complex.", "Even if this is the case, the family still is TA for shaming OP for not being able to afford childcare to come to the wedding. So even if the sister didn't send them, there is more than 1 AH and therefore ESH."]}
