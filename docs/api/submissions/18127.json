She recently sent out inventions. I was invited as a regular guest, not a brides maid or MOH since we live a state apart and obviously there's a certain level of involvement and time that goes into being part of a bridal party, which I understand. \n\nI want to be there for my sister and obviously I'd like to see her get married. \n\nBut the problem is... I'm a single Mom. My son is 6 and when he's not at school I need to be home watching him. So being out for hours at a time isn't really in the cards for me right now. My sister's wedding is child free. \n\nSince it's taking place in her state, I'd need to commute, and I'd probably have to be gone from my house for 2 full days. I can't have family watch my son since they'll all be at the wedding. And I don't really have friends who will babysit for 2 days. \n\nI contacted my sister and asked if she'd be willing to let my son come to the wedding with me, and explained he couldn't be left alone so young and that I didn't have anyone to watch him. She responded by telling me her \"no children\" policy was strict and she wouldn't make exceptions. \n\nI explained my situation again, and said I'd need some form of child care or to bring him with me. I then asked her if she would pay me to hire a nanny or babysitter to watch him. She got offended, and said \"children and weddings are both parts of life\" and I need to \"just figure it out, it's my kid, my problem.\" Which sure that's true, but also... her wedding, her making it a problem by not allowing me to bring my kid.\n\nI told her she could either pay for my child care or I wouldn't be going to her wedding. Which all she did was call me \"ridiculous\" and \"entitled.\" She said she shouldn't have to pay for my child and that part of being an adult is knowing how to take care of that kind of thing. \n\nI think that's ridiculous. Money is tight. Child care is expensive. I can't magically afford for someone to watch my 6 year old and most people would just let me bring him to the wedding. \n\nMy sister says she's definitely not paying for child care, and \"I guess you're not going to the wedding then.\" My whole family is mad at me for \"not being there for my sister.\" \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685010517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13re0t3/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_needs_to_pay_for/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get where you\u2019re coming from, but you went about this all wrong.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s not within my budget to travel so far and also arrange to pay for child care when I get there.  I send my best.\u201d Full stop.  Don\u2019t ask for handouts from a stressed out bride.  Is that what people do?  Good lord.  If she\u2019s gracious she or the family will offer a solution.  But you don\u2019t ask for that.  That\u2019s where the entitlement came from.  In the end the kid is your responsibility, no one else\u2019s.", "YTA. It's no one else's responsibility to pay for your childcare. Completely unreasonable ask", "YTA. I've never heard of a bride/groom being expected to pay for a guest's childcare. What nonsense.", "YTA,. You could have just just politely declined the invite. Your kid, your problem.", "YTA - you would have been justified in declining but assuming its your sister\u2019s responsibility to pay and asking makes you an AH. Childfree weddings most certainly are a thing and this is your kid, so its your responsibility.", "It s ok to expose your concern but i think you went too far when asking her to pay.", "YTA. Your sister can have a child free wedding if she wants, and it's incredibly entitled to ask her to bend the rules for you, or to pay your childcare costs.\n\nIf she then has a go at you for not attending, she's being TA too, but otherwise a straight \"unfortunately I can't afford childcare so I'll have to skip it\" would have sufficed.", "YTA. \n\nYou don't ask your sister to pay for your childcare. You ask your sister if she knows anyone in her town who babysits. Or you get on care.com and look for a babysitter in her town. \n\nChild free weddings aren't uncommon. And she's right, this is part of being a parent. If you truly can't afford a babysitter for a few hours, then you'll have to miss the wedding. But you really should try to prioritize this.", "YTA for your request to have her pay for your childcare and being upset she said no. She has zero obligation to your child. It\u2019s her wedding day, she can set the rules as she wants. However, if it\u2019s not possible for you to attend then it simply isn\u2019t. Yeah more empathy from your sister would be nice. But if no childcare = no wedding, then that\u2019s just a fact.", "YTA\n\nshe can make the wedding child free, and she is probably spending a lot on it so it\u2019s not like there\u2019s leftover money for peoples kids.  You can\u2019t go then, don\u2019t make it their problem or guilt trip them", "YTA... but honestly I do see where you are coming from.  I think the basic situation is that if you cannot afford the childcare to go to a wedding you should just cordially tell her you are really sorry but you cannot get anyone to look after your child and therefore you can't go.    \nI would not have gone and given an ultimatum, i would have explained the situation and said I cannot go as i have no child care and see if she offered anything to me, if she hadn't i would have conceded to myself that i would not be able to go.\n\nI think that would have been a better way to handle it.", "ESH\n\nShe is correct, it is your child so it\u2019s your responsibility to find and pay for child care. Asking her to pay IS entitled. \n\nLikewise, when she decided to have a child free wedding she did so knowing that some people might not be able to come, so she needs to graciously accept your RSVP of not attending and not get upset about it.", "I\u2019d just decline and say childcare isn\u2019t in your finances now as a single mother and you wish her the best.

That\u2019s how you\u2019ve \u201cfigured it out\u201d. Not attending is a valid solution to this problem.

If you can\u2019t afford it or aren\u2019t comfortable leaving your kid with a sitter for two whole days, you can\u2019t go. That\u2019s the rules she made.

She wants a childfree wedding and you can\u2019t afford to have your kid be watched, so the answer is that you don\u2019t go. I think she could have helped, but I also don\u2019t really think she\u2019s obligated to.", "YTA for demanding that she pay for your childcare.  I'm sure she's been engaged for some time and you could have used that time to save money.  It's too bad that you don't seem to have arranged any regular childcare to even be out for an evening, let alone multiple days, but that's on you.", "On 1 hand your problem is a major 1 and needs addresses. On the other hand jumping straight to her paying for a nanny was wrong. You would have been better served simply telling your sis that your sorry but you wont be able to go if there isnt some kind of arrangements for children as you cannot afford a babysitter for 2 days. You could tell her that any ideas are welcome but you just dont see how it is feasible for you to afford it at this time.", "ESH/NAH   \nThis all comes down to how you communicate. \"*I would love to come and support my sister, but I cannot afford childcare for two days*\". Everyone in your family should be able to understand this, including your sister. \n\nHow is your relationship with your sister normally? Do you live far apart? Where does your parents live, and how much time do they spend with you son?Does he have a close friend from school he can stay with?", "I think you should have phrased it \" If you want me to attend, you will need to provide childcare\"\n\nBut no if you can't afford it, then you can't afford  it and you shouldn't go.  \n\nJust tell her that you can't attend for those reasons and you will attend her next one when your son is older.", "NAH\n\nYour sister can have the wedding she wants but she needs to know that has consequences, she knows you\u2019re a single parent with no other child care, what did she think you were going to do? I can\u2019t imagine leaving my nephews and niece out of my wedding", "YTA- you are overwhelmed and stressed and you are not thinking clearly. For some reason you don't want to go to your sister's wedding and maybe you are even a little jealous. Can't you stay at your parent's home and pay a friend of the family to watch your kid or something like that.", "YTA. It's months away and you can't figure out a solution in that amount of time?\nTake the kid with you, hire someone so you can be at the ceremony and dinner, leave after dinner. Hundred bucks tops and everyone's happy.", "NAH, if she is adamant about not bringing kids to the wedding and you don't want to talk me a financial hit to attend then not going to the wedding seems a reasonable outcome. You're both going into AH territory by getting angry at each other and the rest of your family should mind their own business unless they can help you attend.", "You are stuck between a rock and a hard place... which is exactly what you need to say to your family.    \nTell them that instead of being mad... come up with solutions.", "YTA your kid, your problem. Do you expect the bride n groom to pay for everyone's problems? Some might have old people to look after, some might get pay deducted for absence and some might have extra travel requirements.", "YTA What about the option to take the child with you and look for a babysitter there?", "NTA. She is right, your child, your problem, your circumstances dictate that the only solution is staying with him as all other alternatives she has rejected so your problem, your solution and if she doesn't like it that's her problem.", "YTA expecting someone to pay for your childcare is tilypical entitled parent stuff. So you have a kid from some rando at a bar and you can't even afford a babysitter for the night?\n\nWinning!", "YTA. You\u2019re not wrong for saying you can\u2019t go because of your child. It makes perfect sense that you can\u2019t just leave a six year old, but you are the AH for asking her to pay for childcare. Childcare is your responsibility, not hers. That\u2019s like asking someone with a destination wedding to pay for travel costs. If she wants to help you, she can do that. I would make an exception for my sister, but ultimately it\u2019s her choice. Your sister has decided she wants a childfree wedding and that\u2019s perfectly valid. She\u2019ll have to deal with the consequences of people dropping out if they can\u2019t get a babysitter. If you can\u2019t attend because of the cost, that\u2019s valid too, so just say that. \u201cI\u2019d love to, but I just can\u2019t because I can\u2019t arrange or afford childcare for two whole days. Family who would normally help will all be at the wedding.\u201d And your family are also AH for badgering you about not being able to go.", "NTA. Your family shouldn't be making you feel bad, if you can't afford to have someone watch your son that's just how it is.", "ESH, your sister\u2019s wedding is child free. It\u2019s her decision. You asked for an exception; she said no. That should have been the end of the discussion. Continuing to ask her for help is unreasonable, she\u2019s planning a wedding; she obviously didn\u2019t think or doesn\u2019t want to arrange childcare on top of wedding planning. That\u2019s cool. Her wedding. However, the rest of your family guilt tripping you for not coming is over the top. Child free weddings are allowed. But it comes with consequences; one of those consequences is that people with kids sometimes can\u2019t attend. As is said countless times; an invitation is not a summons.", "Well, I guess you aren\u2019t going to the wedding, then. \n\nYou can\u2019t afford to pay for childcare, and anybody that would do it for free will be at the wedding. If your sister really really wants you there, she could bend a little. But she isn\u2019t willing to do that\u2026 so\u2026 you just don\u2019t go.\n\nDon\u2019t let anybody make you feel guilty.

ETA you for asking her to pay for childcare and her/family for expecting you to just have a magical childcare solution. she invited you she doesn't want kids there. You don't have child care so you can't go there's no need to make a song and dance about it. Just reply to the invite saying I'm sorry but I can't make it and that is the end of the issue. Yes it suck you won't beable to attend your sisters wedding but sometimes that's just how things go.", "NTA. \nEveryone is entitled to a childfree wedding if they desire. However, if you have a childfree wedding you've gotta accept it's not feasible for some parents to attend. So goes life. Op literally said her only options are getting a sitter, making an exception, or not attending. A sitter for 2 days and 1-2 nights is very expensive. The sister isn't budging on making an exception for her nephew. So that leaves OP with not being able to attend. If the sister is still insisting on OP attending and not compromising, she can pay for childcare or make an exception. It's that simple.", "NTA. You can't figure out the childcare, so, being a responsible mother, you can't go to the wedding. The family that is mad for you \"not being there for your sister\" has to understand that you simply don't have the money. What, do they also berate you for not having the money in other situations? That's ridiculous.", "NTA. You have been forced to make a choice between your 6 year old child and a 28 year old sister who is acting like one. Easy call.", "NTA.\n\nBut brides, grooms and other wedding planners have to expect that if you make a wedding child free (or destination etc) some people you really wanted to come simply won't be able to.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve been petty and told her to pay for it too. First of all, can\u2019t imagine not allowing my nephew at my wedding. I would absolutely arrange for someone to pick the kid up once the party started. \n\nMy sister got married and she invited my in-laws. They helped watch my kids (her ring bearer and flower girl) and then took them home when the drinking began. My kids were a huge part of her day and the only kids who were invited.

Why are families so fucking terrible to each other?", "NAH- Unfortunate.", "NAH She's allowed to have a child free wedding and you're allowed to decline. Stay home, send a nice card and gift.", "NTA. As a parent you have priorities. If she can\u2019t respect that then too bad.", "Esh - you can\u2019t expect her to pay for your child\u2019s care. She can\u2019t expect a parent with no support to come to a child free wedding", "NTA. But considering your family is mad at you, why don't you ask if they can then help out by each stepping away from the wedding for a half hour or hour to help watch him? That would get you through the ceremony and reception and that is really the only time you need help with child care.", "Absolutely YTA.   Can't even afford to pay childcare for 2 days. Glad your sister said \"I guess you're not going to the wedding then.\"", "NTA\n\nYou tried to reason with her. She didn't budge. So don't go.\n\nThis child free no exceptions!! trend is disgusting.", "ESH.  Your childcare is not your sister's problem.  But then, your family pressuring you to go to the wedding without your son is ridiculous.  \n\nIt's OK to have a childfree wedding.  But if your sister has a young child, you can't expect your sister to travel without him.  At the same time, your sister is in no way, shape or form responsible for childcare for your son.\n\nThere is no logical middle ground here.  Everybody is being unreasonable.  \n\nI'd probably play it this way.  Travel with kiddo.  Find a baby-sitter near the wedding to watch him during the wedding.

She won\u2019t be happy but that\u2019s part of the issue with a child-free wedding, which is entirely fine for her to have.

Your expense.  \n\n> She said she shouldn't have to pay for my child and that part of being an adult is knowing how to take care of that kind of thing.  I think that's ridiculous. Money is tight.\n\nYou....  you think it's ridiculous that you're expected to be responsible for your own child?   What?  \n\nIf money is tight, that's your own issue.

I assume you would stay at the hotel / resort where the wedding is at so you could check in during the day with him, but he wouldn\u2019t be around the wedding party. You would have the best of both then.

You can take your son with you and find someone in her area that specializes in childcare, perhaps like a day care? One that can have an overnight stay?  Yea it will probably cost you a couple hundred extra but you have time to save no?", "NTA\n\nIf she excludes kids she has to understand that one of the consequences might be excluding parents, usually the mother, of young kids. Which it sounds like she does understand... hard to say, did she say \"I guess you're not coming to the wedding\" in a snarky, or sad sort of way? If she was snippy about it she is an asshole, if she was sad and regretful she is not. The relatives who are guilt tripping you are definitely assholes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the asking for money thing, I dunno, in my family we hit each other up for money all the time. I just asked my mom to cover the cost of my tax filing because it requires an American credit card, which, not living in America, I don't have. I'll make it up with groceries when I visit her, or I will take her out to dinner or spot her when she forgets her credit card or whatever, it will even out.", "NTA ... because somehow your family got into guilt tripping you after you said you can't afford to come. Would have said n a h otherwise.", "YTAH! She is right your child your responsibility she shouldn\u2019t have to pay for you, if she pays for you child\u2019s care then she has to pay for others.

You can't expect that your sister pays for the babysitter, while also paying for you to be at the wedding. Also: child-free weddings?

And if your family is so angry, they can offer to babysit in turns so you can all catch some of the wedding.", "NTA but as she said, your kid, your problem and you have stated, no kid, I won't be there. Looks like you have made up your mind and your list of priorities. As she said children and weddings are part of life and you choose one over the other.

But it wasn't, you initiated it almost straight away. I'm sorry, but that's ridiculous. He's your child. Not hers. I get that you want to be there for your sister, but not having childcare is a very good reason to not go. And your sister is not obliged to make exceptions or to pay you to come to her wedding.\n\nShe doesn't get to get upset at you not going, but she does for you just straight up asking her to pay you hundreds of dollars to come after she said she wouldn't be making exceptions.", "YTA-Don\u2019t attend if you cannot afford to pay for your own childcare but don\u2019t try to put her on the hook for it.", "YTA.

She recently sent out inventions. I was invited as a regular guest, not a brides maid or MOH since we live a state apart and obviously there's a certain level of involvement and time that goes into being part of a bridal party, which I understand. \n\nI want to be there for my sister and obviously I'd like to see her get married. \n\nBut the problem is... I'm a single Mom. My son is 6 and when he's not at school I need to be home watching him. So being out for hours at a time isn't really in the cards for me right now. My sister's wedding is child free. \n\nSince it's taking place in her state, I'd need to commute, and I'd probably have to be gone from my house for 2 full days. I can't have family watch my son since they'll all be at the wedding. And I don't really have friends who will babysit for 2 days. \n\nI contacted my sister and asked if she'd be willing to let my son come to the wedding with me, and explained he couldn't be left alone so young and that I didn't have anyone to watch him. She responded by telling me her \"no children\" policy was strict and she wouldn't make exceptions. \n\nI explained my situation again, and said I'd need some form of child care or to bring him with me. I then asked her if she would pay me to hire a nanny or babysitter to watch him. She got offended, and said \"children and weddings are both parts of life\" and I need to \"just figure it out, it's my kid, my problem.\" Which sure that's true, but also... her wedding, her making it a problem by not allowing me to bring my kid.\n\nI told her she could either pay for my child care or I wouldn't be going to my wedding. Which all she did was call me \"ridiculous\" and \"entitled.\" She said she shouldn't have to pay for my child and that part of being an adult is knowing how to take care of that kind of thing. \n\nI think that's ridiculous. Money is tight. Child care is expensive. I can't magically afford for someone to watch my 6 year old and most people would just let me bring him to the wedding. \n\nMy sister says she's definitely not paying for child care, and \"I guess you're not going to the wedding then.\" My whole family is mad at me for \"not being there for my sister.\" \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "ESH Your sister is allowed to make her wedding child free.  It is then the responsibility of any parent invited to the wedding to find childcare if they plan to attend.  That is NOT the bride's responsibility.  So she is correct that you were out of line to ask her to pay for your child's care in order to attend. She's right to be upset you ever asked. \n\nHowever, in making her wedding child free, she also had to accept that some people will choose to or not be able to attend. That's just how it goes and she doesn't get to believe every parent is magically going to have childcare lined up to attend her wedding. Each parent gets to make that decision for themselves and their family.", "I\u2019m gonna go and say NAH. \n\nIdk why everyone feels so strongly about YTA. If my sister was in this position, regardless of what my original plan was, I\u2019d absolutely let my nephew come. I\u2019m getting married in September, and how I view a wedding is\u2026 I want everyone to enjoy the moment and feel their best and just have fun? I want my marriage experience to be where people see the love between my husband and I and our commitment to being kind to others and doing what we can for those we love. I understand everyone views weddings differently.  \n\nYou\u2019re asking a lot of people to be part of your wedding day, they make many accommodations to be there and it is expensive, it\u2019s okay to make accommodations for them.

And truly, if for some reason I didn\u2019t want my nephew to come (I couldn\u2019t imagine) and my sister was in a tight spot, I\u2019d absolutely help her. No question. I\u2019m sorry you are in a position where money is tight, that must must be stressful on top of being a single mom. Have a fun weekend with your son instead!

And then you expect her to pay for someone to watch your kid??? Whoa. Lady, check yourself. Who exactly do you think you are? Here's an idea (it's probably too late now since your whole family is rightfully peeved at your attitude), how about you contact your parents and say hey listen I really want to go support Sister but I'm in a bind. Can you help me afford a sitter? Or do you know if I could place Son with a sitter that is being used for other children in the family for the evening?

It was OP that argued.  It was OP that pushed.  \n\nThe sister did exactly what you said the sister should do.  \n\n>  A sitter for 2 days and 1-2 nights is very expensive. \n\nThere's obvious solutions for this.  The kid comes on the trip, the parents of different kids coordinate in advance to pool money for a babysitter, and the cost is much much lower because it's for only a few hours instead of a few days.  \n\n> The sister isn't budging on making an exception for her nephew. So that leaves OP with not being able to attend. \n\nYes, that's what the sister said.  OP argued back.  Why is the sister the one in the wrong when OP is the one that kept not accepting the answer?  The sister did everything you say.  \n\n> If the sister is still insisting on OP attending and not compromising, she can pay for childcare or make an exception. \n\nWhy?   You directly said to accept that someone isn't coming if they can't.  The sister did that.

That's it.", "That\u2019s why the sister said \u201cI guess you\u2019re not going to the wedding then\u201d.", "> Sister is entitled to a childfree wedding, but she can't expect everyone will be able to attend. \n\nSo then you think the sister is not an AH and OP is, right?  Because the sister did accept that OP wouldn't be able to attend and Op is the one that pushed.", "\u201cI told her she could either pay for my childcare or I wouldn\u2019t be going to her wedding\u201d\n\nThat sounds like a demand to me.", "She was demanding it.  \n\nAnd good.  Parents that act this way should have their invitations revoked.  The entitlement is ridiculous.  A guest that acts that way shouldn't be allowed in.  \n\nPart of being a parent is accepting you can't do everything *and to gracefully bow out and say no thank you to the invitation*.  Not guilt trip people into spending money on your decision to be a parent.  \n\nOf course the sister didn't care if OP was there at this stage.  Wedding guests that act like this should be cut.  Anyone that stirs up drama for their own responsibilities should be cut due to being a bad guest.  In the end it's a party to celebrate for the sister.  If OP is going to be pushy, OP shouldn't go.", "Do they have a good relationship? Is the sister even financially capable of paying? \n\nAnd no, *someone* doesn\u2019t have to pay, OP does. Someone can offer if they want, but ultimately, her kid - her responsibility", "Saying *pay for my childcare or I\u2019m not going* is entitled and ridiculous. It was absurd to make that request. \n\nIf she didn\u2019t have childcare and/or couldn\u2019t afford it, she should have declined and not tried to make it her sisters responsibility.", "That would be fine too, but \"I can't afford it\" and \"I don't want to come\" are two different responses.", "They're not moving there. Holy shit.", "That's a completely different  premise. I think she's looking for excuses to not go to the wedding and make her sister look as the AH here, which is not the case.", "You said you \"have no way to have your kid watched\". What you mean \"no one will watch my kid for free\". Those are completely different things. You don't get to make your decision to be a single mother everyone else's problem.", "If your budget is so tight you can\u2019t afford childcare, then you probably shouldn\u2019t be traveling either.", "Didn\u2019t you said it\u2019s in a few month? So you have some time to safe money. This means: 1-2 less doorbell food, 1-2 less hair appointment, 1-2 less nail appointment and stuff like that. AND(!) you could ask you parents to **borrow** some money for babysitting. So yeah you sound like what your sister said: entitled & ridiculous.\n\nBTW: YTA", "THIS. Sister was not out of line, OP can't figure out the childcare situation, so the sister accepted that OP won't be at the wedding and left it at that. The family who starts berating the OP for, well, not having the money to go, is totally out of line though.", "...what post are you reading? The sister didn't accept that the op wouldn't attend and told her she needs to figure it out so OP can attend.", "I just read it literally. No subtext.", "Bravo! Clap clap.", "She wants to come but can't afford it, not hard to understand,  I was replying to the idea of taking the kid with her and getting a babysitter there", "I don't think you're understanding the post lol", "I don't know OP but as a mother of young kids in a tight financial situation I can tell you that I don't get my hair or nails done, ever, and I don't have food delivered, ever. A friend cuts my hair for free (straight across the bottom). But even if I was doing those things, I would not be able to adjust my budget to cover two a nanny for two consecutive days and nights. $30 x 48 hours is $1,440.", "Agreed. If OP can\u2019t afford to go, that\u2019s that and no one should give her shit for it. \n\nCould you imagine if all wedding guests started to try and charge the couple getting married for their expenses to attend a wedding?", "What post are you reading?  The sister directly said to not attend if she can't find a solution.  It's right there in the post.\n\n> My sister says she's definitely not paying for child care, and \"I guess you're not going to the wedding then.\"", "The post where the sister says \u201cI guess you\u2019re not going to the wedding then\u201d. Right there at the bottom of the post.", "That's my point, they are two different things.\n\nI don't know why you brought up \"maybe she doesn't want to do it\" when the entire post is \"I can't afford it\".\n\nOffering a cheaper way to do something that somebody can't afford is reasonable.", "You say more than once that there's no one to watch you son; but that's clearly a lie if you are even asking your sister for this. It's not that there's no one to watch him or you have no childcare options; you just don't want to pay for it. What am I not understanding?", "I think everyone is understanding except you", "Her sister literally told her to figure it out and her family (including her sister, since she's family) are angry she can't \"figure it out\".", "It's reasonable if she is willing to uproot the kid, if that's not an option then you're not offering a cheaper alternative. The kid is always a parent's priority", "There's a difference between not wanting to pay and not being able to pay due to lack of funds..... If she can't afford childcare then there's no one available to care for her son. It's not difficult at all to understand.", "Can\u2019t afford and won\u2019t pay are not the same thing.", "It's not an issue of \"not wanting\" to pay it's not being able to. I have no one to watch my son unless someone helps pay..."]}
