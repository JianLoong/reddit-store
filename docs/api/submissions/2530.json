It seems like maybe it\u2019s different these days, but I stayed home alone starting when I was around 9. If you think he\u2019s responsible enough for it I see no problem.", "NTA. 12 is getting close to the age where you could reasonably start to babysit other kids. I mean it's also part judgement call on your part as to whether they're mature enough, but at first blush I'd say it's old enough to stay alone for a good chunk of the day. I mean don't abandon the kid every day all day, and I'd call it good. And definitely better leaving him home a bit longer instead of deciding to drive your other kids home when you still had alcohol in your blood.", "NTA. \n\nI was left alone starting at nine years old. Ive been leaving my son home alone since he was ten.. Your family needs to stay in their lane", "NTA I was staying home alone at about that age.", "NTA. He's old enough to be by himself for awhile. As long as he had a way to contact you in an emergency he's perfectly safe for a few hours. As someone who was once that older sibling, it's so great to just have some along time for awhile. Being at parties with lots of younger kids can get tiring or overwhelming when your that age. Too young to be apart of the adult talks, but too old to really enjoy playing with the younger ones anymore. It just sucks. You made the right choice here.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t want to go, he\u2019s old enough to be left by himself. He didn\u2019t do what he wasn\u2019t supposed to do.", "NTA. When I was 12, my parents left me home alone all time. My friends\u2019 parents did the same thing. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.\n\n12 is a reasonable age to leave a kid home alone during the day.", "I've got a 12yo daughter who is quite happy to stay home alone and she's responsible and mature enough to do it. And it's been that way since 9 or 10. Heck, now at 12, we don't do it but I'm sure she'd be comfortable staying at the house alone for a long weekend if we were gone. She knows how to cook food and do everything she'd need to do. Our neighborhood is fairly upscale and safe and I could see things being different in a different kind of neighborhood.", "NTA - You made a reasonable decision as a father and no one else's opinion about it matters.", "NTA. It\u2019s your kid, and you know your kid the best. Which you believe he was responsible enough to be by himself half a day and it seems like he did fine. And most kids are staying home around that age.", "NTA\n\nIf he's a responsible kid and could phone you if needed, I see no problem. He's going to be a teenager soon. At the age of 12, I was baby-sitting my younger siblings while my parents went to the supermarket, and we didn't have cell phones then.\n\nYour family members might have had less to complain about if Josh had spent the day at a friend's house, with the friend's parents there. However, I don't see where you did anything wrong.", "NTA. The assholes are the people forcing their unsolicited parenting advice onto you. \n\nIf a child is mature enough to be home alone, I don't see a problem with it. I also think it is important for kids to have autonomy and be given options and be permitted to make some of their own decisions. It helps them weigh pros and cons, helps them take accountability for consequences, and gives them a sense of pride and independence. Teaches them to trust themselves (and even seems to have built more trust between you two since he seemed to have followed your directions!) So everyone that was mad can pound sand, ya know?", "NTA sounds like he had the day he wanted and yall got to enjoy the party (minus the people being angry lol) hopefully you checked in with him a bit throughout the day?", "NTA. As long as there\u2019s no laws against a 12 year old being home alone for that length of time where you are (I know this varies) and you feel he is mature enough to do so, I see no issue with it", "NTA - hey when we were that age, my single mom left us on our own when she went to work, or we would come home from school and have to wait until she got there.......or we would ride our bikes around the neighbourhood all day and no one said anything.......these days, I believe the youngest you can leave a child on their own here is 13........because you know, weirdos.\n\nI think its healthy for a 12 year old to be given a little responsibility for themselves - it shows you trust them.  He was in his own house, and was able to amuse himself.  I'm not seeing how thats wrong.", "NTA 12 is a fine age to leave a kid home alone for a few hours.", "Sounds like a lot of busy busybodies who are being exhausting. I particularly like the criticism that you didn't let him do things with friends despite the fact that he literally did. Of course a twelve year old, with no history of highly questionable behavior, is old enough to stay home for four hours unattended. NTA", "Each kid is unique and so is each situation.  12 is a little young in my book but it would depend on the circumstances.  As a parent I'm not one to grant my kids their fits, simple rules, you cry or lie and you don't get what you want.  This applies to all situations  and so long as I'm consistent it's worked well.  In your situation, I would have taken him because of the rules being in play.  \nYour families reaction is one from their point of view.  Expectations of seeing all your kinds or family first and all that so the response is not unexpected.  Might even speak to deeper issues at play but not in the context given.  \nNAH IMO", "NTA - He was fine and you were fine with it then all is good.", "NTA at 12 I was babysitting two kids and a blind & deaf great grandma on NYE.", "NtA for letting him stay home alone. However,  in this case, I would have required my child to go. Sometimes we do things we don't want to do to show others we care about them and support them. Not everything we're going to do is going to be fun. Are baby showers, wedding showers and the like fun? No, but we go anyway because it's important to our family or friend. I wouldn't let my child bow out of everything they feel won't hold enough entertainment value for them.", "So if he'd needed you , you couldn't have driven straight to him because you maybe had a drink or two? \nLeaving him home is NTA but drinking any amount that impares ability to drive whilst in charge of three children as a sole custody time parent you are very much TA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's normal & fine, with reasonable boundaries for his age.", "NTA  \n\nAt 12 he's old enough to be by himself for a few hours. \n\nIt's nice that you gave him the opportunity to not go to a party he wasn't interested in and to have fun at home by himself.", "NTA, he\u2019s 12- that\u2019s old enough to be home alone for a few hours. If you trust him not to get into trouble and like, eat something decent enough it\u2019s fine. \n\nThe *only* reason why you\u2019d be kind of a butt is that you didn\u2019t use a white lie and say he wasn\u2019t feeling well or had a lot of homework or something, you just straight up said he didn\u2019t wanna go \ud83d\ude02", "Nta, and as fir the friends and family...\nThey need to play in thier own yards and stay out of yours. \nYour capable  of deciding for your own family.

That's legal to be home alone and about the age many kids start babysitting. As long as there aren't extenuating circumstances, like a 12-year-old who has special needs or is particularly sensitive or immature, there's generally no issue with them taking care of themselves when need be. Just be sure you've taught your kids basic safeties and skills- what to do in case of this or that, how to make basic foods, etc. (That goes as general advice to anyone.)\n\nIn this case, I kind of assume what your family is most miffed about is just the honest answer that your son wasn't interested in going to a family event and you didn't make him. Which is totally ok! But some people take offense to not forcing kids into family activities and, in their mind, \"just letting them do whatever they want\". Seems you got a little passive-aggressive blowback for that even if they didn't come out and say that.", "NTA. Your son is getting into his teenage years, and there will be times he wants his space. Good on you for respecting that.

He can say at home by himself for a few hours.", "As long as he has a phone to call you, he\u2019s fine.  Now I wouldn\u2019t leave him home to watch the other two, you\u2019d probably come home to a crime scene.

(Or longer during the week when my 7 yo brother and I were home together while parents worked.) It was safe mostly because we didn\u2019t do stupid things. Your son played games\u2014he was safe and probably enjoyed himself thoroughly.", "??? NTA. The kid didn't have any problem and he did hang out with his friends the whole day... Just online. Hello?
