I'm willing to bet your discord friends aren't Japanese, so it's a little weird of them to tell YOU, a Japanese woman, that you're just \"kinkshaming.\" \n\nHe IS a pervert and I wouldn't feel safe around him, especially not if I were Japanese. You did the right thing.", "NTA, you do not have to engage in and feed his sexual fantasies. It's hugely inappropriate of him to talk about you and friends as if you are exotic sex objects.

He's fetishizing people (and your whole culture) to the point of dehumanization, reducing real, nuanced human beings to sex objects for his fantasies. He's an asshole for making his 'kinks' other people's problem to deal with. A person's right to express their kinks publicly end at the exact point where other people's rights begin. He does not have the right to make other people feel uncomfortable or disrespected in order to express his sexual preferences.\n\nYou were right to snap at him. You weren't rude.

NTA at all. It sounds like you've already put up with completely inappropriate behavior from this guy for way longer then you should have. \n\nRepeatedly making unwanted sexual comments to someone isn't a kink, it's sexual harassment.

But as someone that is also enamored with Japanese culture (not fetishizing the women) that shit is too far.

He\u2019s completely dehumanizing Japanese women. That\u2019s not a kink, that\u2019s a problem.
