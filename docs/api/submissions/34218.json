And it's always appropriate to kink shame when you are being involved in someone else's kink without your consent!", "NTA, and anyone who disagrees with that is insane.\n\nJapan isn't a kink, that's ridiculous. I'm willing to bet your discord friends aren't Japanese, so it's a little weird of them to tell YOU, a Japanese woman, that you're just \"kinkshaming.\" \n\nHe IS a pervert and I wouldn't feel safe around him, especially not if I were Japanese. You did the right thing.", "NTA, you do not have to engage in and feed his sexual fantasies. It's hugely inappropriate of him to talk about you and friends as if you are exotic sex objects. He is creepy, best to leave him to his own devices.", "NTA.\n\n\u30a2\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306f\u30ad\u30e2\u30a4\u3067\u3059 \u3002\n\nYou didn't 'kinkshame' him. He's fetishizing people (and your whole culture) to the point of dehumanization, reducing real, nuanced human beings to sex objects for his fantasies. He's an asshole for making his 'kinks' other people's problem to deal with. A person's right to express their kinks publicly end at the exact point where other people's rights begin. He does not have the right to make other people feel uncomfortable or disrespected in order to express his sexual preferences.\n\nYou were right to snap at him. You weren't rude. Alex is rude.\n\nDon't show him around Tokyo. You shouldn't feel obligated to spend time with someone who doesn't respect you as a person. And if he tries to come back to the discord, or other people like Jen or Mary try to pressure you, don't yield or apologize. You were right to say what you said.", "Fucking weeb.", "Oh wow. NTA at all. It sounds like you've already put up with completely inappropriate behavior from this guy for way longer then you should have. \n\nRepeatedly making unwanted sexual comments to someone isn't a kink, it's sexual harassment. I don't know what world Jen and Mary living in, but having \"an interest in Japan\" does not in any way justify objectifying and sexually harassing Japanese women. You are completely right. In fact, you should probably have been much ruder.", "NTA \n\nHe\u2019s very creepy\u2026 if he\u2019s making sexual comments about you and your friends and only talks about things that make you feel uncomfortable you have every right to correct him. Women aren\u2019t objects. You should block him and tell the others in the chat he makes you uncomfortable. Friends should make you feel safe.", "NTA. Ew. Block Alex.", "that guy is watching way too many hanime \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02..\n\nNTA it's fine to keep a safe distance sometimes for your own sanity", "NTA.  Its not kinkshaming.  He seems to want to include you in these conversations that make you feel uncomfortable.  In such cases you are completely within your rights to shut down his inappropriate conversations.\n\nI am chuckling at your \"Japan would not want a pervert like him.\"  I have lived in Japan and the only thing I could think of was that Japanese men wouldnt want the competition maybe.", "He\u2019s in a rude awakening you may know this but don\u2019t you get work to death over there?
