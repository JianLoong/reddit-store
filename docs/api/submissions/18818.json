I\u2019m not bothered by it at all because night shifts are hard, but she wants me to cook, clean, and work a full time job while providing for the family of 4. I barely have any work experience due to her not allowing me to have a summer job throughout high school. my last \u201cwork\u201d experience was the summer of 2020 at my local humane shelter, even then at the age of 15 I had to provide for the family. no biggie, she\u2019s a single mother trying to make ends. But i\u2019m also leaving for college this upcoming fall, she keeps insisting me that college is not a right fit for me and to work night shifts with her. i keep telling her \u201ci\u2019m not going to provide for you, you can work, cook and clean just like i can\u201d. She then tells me i\u2019m not grateful for what i have and she\u2019s never good enough. She\u2019s threatened to kick me out and call the cops on my boyfriend for \u201ckidnapping\u201d.

When i stay with my boyfriend for a week i come back home to see the house a complete mess and it\u2019s suddenly my responsibility to get it back to where it was. i also have no drivers license at the moment because she had cancelled every single driver test i made while i was a minor, i\u2019ve had a drivers test made for the past few months and she deliberately makes plans on the day of the test.", "created_utc": 1685739251, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13you5n/aita_for_not_wanting_to_provide_my_family_of_4/", "score": 242, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's even threatening to throw you out and legally she could do that at any time and without warning.\n\nBy the way, you are an adult. You can go with your boyfriend and she can do little more than go outside to yell at bushes. If she calls the cops then you can just explain that you left willingly and that would be it.", "No, NTA.  You are her daughter not her husband.", "Yikes to people who said ESH. For me it's a very clear case of NTA. Your mother prevents you from developing yourself as an independent human being. While I understand she needs help and therefore relies on you, in my humble opinion this is parentification and not good for children, even if you're 18 yo. \n\nI think you can trust your relatives/boyfriend on this. Stick to your plan. Her saying college is not a fit for you is her saying she doesn't want you to develop yourself.\n\nEdit: helping to clean the house is different. But financially supporting your family while you're barely an adult is not ok.", "You are not to the asshole.\n\nIt's reasonable to expect a child will provide some support to their parents as compensation for raising them.\n\nIt's not reasonable to intimidate your child into giving up college for your sake.\n\nOn a sidenote, if the threat to call the police is genuine, then I would suggest you call the police first on their non-emergency line. Let them know about the possibility of receiving a fake call from your mum.", "Info: who are the other two members of the family? If they\u2019re minors, where\u2019s their father?

If you can graduate high school on time while running the household-all cooking, cleaning and care of siblings, then you can handle college.  Have your boyfriend or a girlfriend help with the driving test so mom doesn\u2019t know.  Take your boyfriend up on the job offer.  Get a new bank account at a different bank so mom has no access to your money.  You\u2019re an adult, move in with boyfriend temporarily if you must, the cops won\u2019t do anything once you tell them you are 18 and with him by choice.\nI\u2019m sorry your mom isn\u2019t happy for all you\u2019ve earned and achieved.

Especially since you're also living there. Sounds to me that it's time to leave and get your own place.", "NTA. Leave immediately. Made a new appointment for the test and do not tell her.", "This comment nails it. \n\nI recommend that you get a brand-new bank account, at a different bank than your mother uses. Start a checking account - you'll need one to direct deposit checks. Then start a savings account. For the savings account, you're likely better off with an online option such as Ally or Capital One, where you'll get a much higher rate of interest on your savings. Link the two accounts so whenever you have cash to spare, even if it's $10, you can transfer it from your checking to your savings. DO NOT GIVE ANYONE ELSE ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNTS. Don't even tell anyone about your savings account.\n\nThe goal, and it's hard in this economy so just do your best, is to have a financial cushion in case of emergency. You don't want to be stuck living with a toxic or abusive partner because you had to flee your mom's house at 18. Sock aside what you can - tax returns, extra hours at work, cash back from grocery reward apps, however you can scrounge up a little extra money here and there - let it earn interest and don't pull from it unless absolutely necessary. \n\nBest of luck to you.", "No shit.

There might be a moral obligation but your mom can\u2019t just take everyone\u2019s money and do what she wants with it. If you go work with her, she\u2019ll take it too. Go live your life, you deserve it. Check on your brother and grandma regularly if *they* need anything.", "NTA. Get the hell out. \n\nYour mother's actions are not those of single mother needing help. She has shown you in countless ways that she wants you in her home for the long haul. Trying to talk you out of college and getting in the way of getting your driver's license, while you are totally responsible for the house and your siblings, are all actions to sabotage you leaving the house to better yourself. \n\nFollowing her advice will lead you to living paycheck to paycheck on minimum wage, and carrying all of her load over time.

I agree with the earlier commenters AND I hope you can get your important documents in your own possession, e.g. birth certificate, social security card, etc. \n\nI hate to say it but it sure sounds like your mom is working very hard and she is also using you to cover everything else in her life.

OP, your mom has been parentifying you for years and is planning on continuing to do so.

So you working and putting in money would Help provide. \n\nYour family's situation sucks. Your mom is probably depressed and miserable. Taking care of an autistic kid, OR an elderly parent is seriously tough, and you guys have both. Caretaker burnout is real. She probably burned out a when you were younger.\n\nI really feel for your mom, but no way should she be taking this out on you. She is being manipulative, and while as you are living there you should help, all of this should not fall on your shoulders.

You're 18 now. If you want to leave, you legally can. Your mother cannot stop you. She cannot call the cops on your boyfriend for kidnapping, because as soon as they see you're 18 the first thing they're going to do is actually ask you whether or not you're there of your own free will. As soon as you say yes and can confirm that you aren't in any danger, which shouldn't be hard because let's be honest cops don't really try that hard, your mother would more likely than not end up looking at getting in trouble for wasting the police's \"valuable\" time.\nThe whole kidnapping thing isn't really going to work unless you have been declared unfit to take care of yourself by the state or by any hospital.", "I'd definitely be thinking exit strategy here, it's one thing to ask you to contribute, but to expect you to support a family at 18, that's rough.

Don\u2019t let her make those types of decisions for you too. At 18 your life just began, escape the toxicity now. When you are 30 and look back you won\u2019t regret it. If you stay, at 30 you\u2019ll be looking back and wishing you escaped while you had the chance. Picture this as being prison, and the cell door is opened, but it isn\u2019t going to stay that way forever.
