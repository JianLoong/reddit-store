I was really excited and proud of what I put together. Well, the commentary on my draft came through and the grade itself wasn't was I was hoping for, but that's not what got to me. \n\nWhat pissed me off was the complete lack of actual suggestions or critiques. The definition of surrealism was copy/pasted into the notes of the assignment by the professor, with no comments on the content of my work other than telling me I had to start over completely.  No notes on how to make something more fitting in the image or how what I provided could be adjusted to be more fitting. Nope, just told to start over. I work full time and I'm in school full time, I thought I'd be spending time on revisions and not an entirely new project. I simply don't have time available in the week with my other courses as well to go back and forth with her about more drafts. Not to mention, one of the examples provided was literal planes flying in arbitrary space through bubbles. Wow, so surreal...\n\nSo I replied in the comments essentially saying as much. I told her I would've appreciated actual feedback on the work I provided instead of being told to start over entirely with no real critiques on my work. I said I would provide a brand new project if that was what she wanted, but I also wanted to ensure that my inability to fit a both a new rough draft AND new final draft into 1/3 of the original amount of provided time will not result in docked points, and only one final project will be provided by me. I also asked her not to copy/paste dictionary definitions at me, as it's pretty condescending and unnecessary. My final suggestion was to pull the \"exemplary example\" from the assignment description, as it's no more surreal than the project I submitted.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not asking for a higher grade and I plan to concede to her request for a brand new project, but I wanted to share my disappointment that the one assignment that wasn't \"make this picture look exactly like what I did\" was the one that received literally zero actual criticism. I was venting to my sister (a teacher) who told me that I was rude and undermining her intent for the assignment or something?

It was her incredibly gentle way of letting you know that you were so far off the mark with what you submitted that you didn't even seem to understand the concept, or what surrealism means. She gave you the dictionary definition and asked you to start again because it was KINDER than having to actually say to you, point-blank, \"What you submitted is so far outside the parameters of the assigment that I'm concerned that you don't even understand what we're talking about.\" So she very gently, kindly, gave you the clearest definition possible of what she is looking for, and asked you to begin again. \n\nShe wasn't being patronising, she was giving you a second chance whilst trying not to embarrass you. And you responded with obnoxious vitriol and condescension. Yikes. \n\nAs someone else noted, if you genuinely had a problem with how she responded, you could have asked to speak to her. Instead you assumed that you were in the right, that she was doing something wrong, and attacked her angrily. Literally everything about your premise was mistaken. That seems to be a trend with you. So yes, YTA.", "YTA\n\nIf you want feedback or help on how you can improve your grade, *you fucking ask*. Send them an *polite* email or ask to meet them during their office hours.\n\nTalking that way to a professor is a pretty good way to sabatoge yourself.", "i can see how it would be frustrating to be graded like you didn't understand what the professor wanted, without being given any helpful instructions to improve.\n\nbut the way you responded was way over the top. just saying you were surprised by the grade and would appreciate some constructive feedback in their own words would've been fine, but your sister is right. you were rude.

How would you suggest I improve my new submission? \n\nPerhaps, she felt the assignment directions were very clear & you did not follow directions. If that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s nothing to critique. You just did not do the assignment. \n\nIt appears you have a lot on your plate & maybe took your frustrations out on the wrong person.\n\nYTA", "You criticized your professor I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. I think this falls under the know your audience category.", "YTA.  \n\nShe sent you the definition of surrealism because apparently, judging by your comment \u201cwow, so surreal,\u201d you don\u2019t know what artistic surrealism is. Outside of school, you\u2019ll be expected to understand what a client wants when they ask for your services for an artistic interpretation or style done in photoshop. Apparently, your default mode is to be led by the nose and then complain about the way someone speaks to you. When you hit the real world what will you do when your employer or client tells you you don\u2019t understand the assignment? Will you flip on them too or will you take what communication they give you, and figure it out? Admit that you didn\u2019t understand what surrealism is, and start over. The working world will fire you or find someone else for their projects if you can\u2019t understand or research a simple visual concept.", "YTA. It's understandable that you feel frustrated and disappointed with the feedback you received on your draft for the Photoshop collage project. It can be disheartening when you put in a lot of effort and receive minimal guidance in return. However, it's important to approach the situation with professionalism and respect, both in your interactions with your professor and in your venting to others.\r When expressing your concerns to your professor, it's crucial to maintain a polite tone and focus on your desire for constructive criticism. While it's valid to express your disappointment in the lack of feedback, it's important to do so in a respectful manner. Emphasize your willingness to learn and improve, and ask for specific suggestions on how you can make the project more fitting or how your existing work could be adjusted. By doing this, you demonstrate your commitment to the assignment and your desire to understand and meet the professor's expectations.\r It's worth considering that your professor may have limited time available to provide detailed feedback, especially if they have a large number of students or other responsibilities. While this doesn't excuse the lack of feedback, it can help to contextualize the situation. However, it's still reasonable to expect some form of constructive criticism or guidance to help you improve.\r Regarding your sister's perspective as a teacher, it's important to consider her point of view. She might have felt that your response to the professor was too confrontational or could be interpreted as undermining the professor's intent for the assignment. Remember that constructive communication can lead to better outcomes, even if you feel frustrated. Engaging in a respectful dialogue can help you clarify your concerns and potentially reach a more satisfactory resolution.\r In conclusion, while your disappointment with the lack of feedback is understandable, it's important to approach the situation with professionalism and respect. Seek constructive criticism from your professor, demonstrate your willingness to improve, and maintain open communication channels to ensure a productive learning experience.", "YTA\n\nThere is a better way to approach the situation rather than saying you \n\n>would've appreciated actual feedback on the work I provided\n\nI'm sorry but that is backhanded rude to the extreme. She is a professor and they mark your work as you see fit. If you want additional feedback ask to speak with her in person or over a call if possible to get a better idea of where you went wrong. \n\nTo translate what you told her:\n\nYour marking isnt good enough for me to understand what I need to change. Also dont sound condescending when MARKING my work.", "ESH\n\nTelling a student to start over with no substantive feedback seems lazy on the professor's part but then they can be extremely overworked and you didn't even ask just immediately started insulting them. Telling them to change their course material was a step too far.\n\nI get your frustration and I do think some of it is justified but you could have asked politely first, maybe they didn't have time, maybe they didn't bother because they felt most students would not care. You really should have asked politely first.\n\nBut also, this is not a battle you are likely to win this way even if you were 100% in the right. Not every battle is worth fighting.", "YTA This isn't how you approach a professor for help. You needed to ask for a meeting to go over specifics. Instead, you were rude and attacked your professor.", "YTA. Have you ever instructed before? What makes you think that you are more qualified than her to suggest how she should be teaching? \n\nYou should have raised your concerns or asked for specific feedback after you got her notes or explained that you didn\u2019t understand what the instructor was looking for. Its fine to ask more from your prof but what you did was talk to down to her and demand a certain grade. \n\n\nDoing multiple iterations and revisions is not uncommon in the visual arts profession. In fact, doing multiples helps you develop skills in the long run.", "YTA. Were you one of those kids in school when you were younger who would have your mommy or daddy go and demand your teacher give you a better grade when you didn't like the one you were given...?", "Yeah, no. The correct response would have been to send your professor a professional and POLITE email requesting a one-on-one meeting during their office hours to discuss where your misunderstanding of the assignment occurred and what improvements could be made. Perhaps if you had come together you could of came up with some middle ground about what she was expecting and what you had already done, so you wouldn\u2019t have to completely start over again. Unfortunately, that may no longer be an option after you lost your temper and took your stress out on her.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t high school. Your an adult now. Professors are not expected to (nor do they have too) hold your hand through out the process. You were so far off the mark the professor literally told you to start over. At that point I\u2019m pretty sure little notes and comments in the margins wouldn\u2019t have mattered that much and would have also just been a waste of the professors time. The professor was kind enough to allow her students to submit and grade a draft before they sent in their final project. Keep in mind that the grade you got for the draft could of been your final grade. Situations like this are EXACTLY why she set this up in first place. As I said, you\u2019re an adult and this is YOUR education. Therefore, it\u2019s YOUR responsibility to seek THEM out for help and clarification when you need it. YTA.", "NTA\n\nShitty teachers exist, seems like you stumble upon one. You were right to except actual criticisms on your work, not just generic crap.", "YTA - there was a nicer way to ask for additional feedback and there was no need to even mention the pasted definitions at all. I also don't think it's your place to tell her what examples to use or not use.\n\nYou could have just explained that you would appreciate more specific feedback.", "Professors vary significantly in many qualities, including things as basic as how well they can communicate their thoughts, how much time they have for each student, and how much they care about teaching in the first place.\n\nPaying (usually) thousands of dollars for a class, and then not being given basic courtesy in response can be very frustrating, and there isn't guaranteed to be anything you can do about it. The most likely route to success, if it isn't too late, is to drop this class and try again with a different professor.\n\nI want to be very clear that the professor disrespected you first, and that means you are NTA for responding in kind (or slightly kinder).\n\nBut. This is not likely to get you more useful feedback. Office hours, a polite email, talking to other students, or asking a teacher's assistant (if there is one) would all be better ways to get actionable feedback.", "NTA and if you continue to not get feedback go to the dean. The copy pasted definition is not feedback and i absolutely cannot understand the perspective of other commenters saying you should have just rolled over and started a new project.", "She is the professor and you are the student.  She is the superior and you are the inferior.  She has authority and you do not.  Know your place.\n\nYou can't chastise a person in authority over you and expect good things to happen.  Just dumb.  You will antagonize them and make an enemy when you could have changed your approach and gotten the help you wanted and made a strong ally.  Instead of being angry and disrespectful you could have asked to schedule a meeting for the purpose of getting more clarity on your grade and her feedback.  Then gone over everything you wanted.  Most professors would be happy as hell to have a student genuinely interest in learning. She would have been on your side in the future.\n\nNot now though.  \n\nMaybe you will smarten up and beg for forgiveness.\n\nYTA, disrespectful, stupid comment to make to a person with authority over you.", "lol YTA. How obnoxious can you be?", "NTA. Your response is that of a mature, competent adult in the process of learning a new skill. You are absolutely right to expect constructive, detailed notes and explanations how to do better. In this scenario, the professor's role is that of an art director, and she should have given you specific pointers how to achieve the results she expected.

Some assignments said one kind of submission in the actual Canvas assignment posting (ex. low-res jpg zipped with the PSD project, or XYZ resources used in project zipped in with submission) and then there would be an attached word doc with the assignment criteria that was different than the canvas posting, so I'd reach out to see what kind of submission she actually wanted, as there were two different requirements provided. And I never heard back and basically had to wing it and hope I picked the right content to submit for all 3.", "I hate to say it, but that sounds like standard sci-fi, not surrealism. Maybe something similar that was grounded on Earth would have been closer to the mark.", "Very kindly OP, from your description it sounds like you created a sci-fi environment, not a surrealist piece. Surrealism is chaotic, nonsensical, like stuff you might see in a dream. Your work sounds well thought out, but too rational.", "Sci-fi isn't surrealism though. Maybe if you put aliens in a bathtub or had the marshmallows in hot chocolate be planets, I'd understand. But, aliens on a planet isn't surreal at all. You need to apologize immediately.", "That\u2019s not surrealism and now I see why your professor sent you the definition, because it sounds like you got confused or actually don\u2019t know what it means. Before commenting, I think you should have seen the definition, then your art, then you probably would have been able to see the mistake.\n\nIt\u2019s sounds like you just made a sci-fi setting.", "You said you pored over the sources and examples the professor gave you, but if you had, I would guess you'd get an idea of what the Surrealist movement was all about. It doesn't just mean \"weird shit.\" You know Dali and the melting clocks? That's probably the most famous example. It *is* weird, but in specific ways.", "Surrealism is about melding weird things with reality. \n\nSo, there need to be elements of our reality. Sci-fi or fantasy art are different - that's pure fiction.\n\nI think the bubble space works because we have real items - plane, bubbles - in a place where they don't belong - space. The space is just an element to juxtapose items, it's not saying that surrealism is sci-fi.\n\nIf you did obviously alien creatures in a traditional earth setting, like a 1950s style cookie cutter neighborhood, the juxtaposition of the weird and the normal would be surreal. \n\nI am struggling to think of a way to make the obviously alien setting work - maybe you could add very obviously human things to it. Like a Walmart or a McDonald's or Starbucks to this weird place. Those should be very obviously human and out of place, not done in an alien style to blend in.", "If you really want feedback share it here.", "I mean, your project sounds like an interesting idea in its own right but I agree with those that say it is pure sci-fi rather than surreal. You mention the professor included the dictionary definition, did they highlight the \"unnatural or irrational juxtapositions and combinations\" part of that definition? Because that sounds like what is missing. What you made (by your description) does not sound irrational or unnatural as a whole but rather cohesive and an interpretation of an alien planet. I think you missed the mark on the unexpected elements of surrealist imagery.\n\nWhile it might not help you, I've always asked myself \"would Dali paint this?\" just because his work stuck with me the most out of the well-known surrealists.", "PS. I disagree with the comments that the definition was feedback. That's snarky. What I said is feedback. It took 2 min. What is the teacher doing that they couldn't write that? It's rude just to copy paste the dictionary definition,  you obviously tried hard and just missed the mark slightly.  The teachers job is to teach, which means explaining the definition. \n\nI wouldn't have reacted the way you did but also I get the feeling that you tried hard and put yourself into it and likely reacted out of hurt. I also think art is hard to teach and it would feel horrible to put yourself put there as an artist and get that back as a response without any attempt to understand where you're coming from or to help you improve.", "OP created a straight sci fi scene. Because OP apparently thought that surrealism (which has a substantial intellectual history, presumably coveted during lecture) meant \"stuff that looks weird/otherworldly.\"\n\nSo the professor's critique--this isn't surrealism, here's a definition of surrealism to get you restarted, redo the piece to match the assignment--is right on the mark.\n\nOP went scorched earth instead of seeking clarification/further help.", "It's not babysitting. The prof should be giving feedback on their work. If you think wanting feedback is babysitting, then you are as deluded as OP is. I've taken many courses at the post secondary level, both in university and in technical colleges. Not once have I ever had an instructor or prof not be willing to tell me what I'm doing wrong or right in the class.", "That professor sounds awful. Why teach an artistic course if you're just going to be a passion crushing pedant? Art is subjective and up to interpretation which is why OPs professor should have given more direction and explained why OPs work wasn't surrealist, rather than just flippantly sending a definition and an order to start over.", "Also, as an afterthought, I think the reason she didn't provide any hints or suggestions was because if she tells you what to do, it's going to be like it's her project and not yours. The concepts need to come from your perspective.", "Thank you, I haven't poked around much on the art subreddits here, I definitely don't consider myself an artist so I was intimidated to try, but maybe I'll give it a go to see what they say. \n\nI only have 4 days left in the course and was given my draft comments yesterday, so I honestly don't have time to try and schedule a meeting with her, but seeing as previous attempts at communication throughout the class were either ignored or unseen, I'm assuming I'm just throwing shit at a wall and hoping it sticks at this point.", "Honestly, this post has made grossly self conscious now so I'll probably just sit on this horrible feeling and literally copy a concept from an example she gave but with different components because at this point I guess that's what she expected. I won't have to deal with her again after this week and if she doesn't like me after this, I'll surely survive. \n\nI also love everyone jumping in asking \"WhAt HaPpEnS wHeN yOuR bOsS gIvEs YoU cRiTiCiSmS?\" I take them? lol he tells me where I went wrong and I improve...isn't that how it's supposed to go? Don't think I'd have been offered this employer-sponsored paid tuition opportunity to finish my degree if they thought I wasn't someone who likes to learn and grow and improve. Sorry for rambling under your comment, felt like one of the few it was safe to do so cause of the lack of name-calling :)", "im saying anybody who approaches this scenario from the perspective of \"she is above you and you are below her and thus by contradicting her you have stepped out from your lowly place. grovel to her, worm, or your education shall be wasted\" isn't reasonable and can be ignored.\n\ndoes she have authority? sure. is she \"the superior\"? lmao fuck no", "Okay, well he\u2019s an AH for not responding to those I suppose but thats not what you\u2019re asking here. \n\nHad you previously asked for guidance about the actual content of assignments and been shot down it would be one thing, but you hadn\u2019t. \n\nA simple email really could have saved you from all of this.", "Exactly what I was gonna say! Maybe you tried to make something look real rather than take something real and distort it?", "At a guess, the prof is dealing with an angry, highly defensive student who resists feedback and has been demonstrating an unwillingness to learn all semester. Further, the prof may not be tenured, and has no energy for constructing an elaborate defense against the scathing evaluation this person is obviously going to write. The fewer words this prof uses to give feedback to this person, the fewer weapons they have to sling at her.", "You should take a look at the comment where OP actually describes the piece they made. It definitley missed the mark in a pretty big way to the point the professor\u2019s comments made total sense. \n\nIt was not surreal whatsoever which is why they pasted the definition, and told them they had to start over because it was not salvageable.", "\"Can not be salvaged\" IS feedback. And giving the textbook definitions IS feedback, too.", "In the context of knowing the material she is also the superior.  She has superior knowledge of the subject matter and that's why she's teaching the class and he's just a student.\n\nLet's be practical, he could have been polite, respectful and asked for a meeting.  No groveling would have been required when you start with a simple, polite email, *\"I am stuck and need some additional feedback.  Could you please meet with me to discuss my project in more detail.  Does XyzDate at XyzTime work for you?  If not could you suggest a different date/time?  Thanks\"*. Turn the read receipt on that too.   Maybe he would have gotten a response or maybe not.  Maybe he would have had to follow up with another email and cc'ed her department head.   A tiny bit hostile but the proper chain of escalation too. Probably would have gotten a positive response with that.  \n\nYou think he's going to get that now?  If he wants that help from her now, he's going to have to grovel.  No department head or anyone else at the school is going to help him when he's been a disrespectful little shit.  \n\nBeing polite and respectful to everyone is smart and doubly smart to be polite and respectful to people who have the power to make your life miserable.\n\nOP is not smart.", "And then he got actual feedback from Internet strangers instead of a link to dictionary.com.", "lmao not even close. \"you did it wrong, do it right\" is not feedback at all", "[deleted]", "I'm expecting her to give feedback on how the piece can be improved or what can be avoided for the next piece. i'm expecting her to have specific examples - \"this isn't surreal, you were coming at this from X when you needed to come at it from Y'. im expecting her to take time out of her day to help a student when a student asks for help.\n\ny'know, basically any more than the bare minimum of copy pasting a definition OP already has?", "So, reteach the entire lesson and hand-hold the student through each step. \n\nIn college.\n\nGot it. \n\nAlso, this student didn\u2019t ask for help. They submitted whatever the hell they wanted and got pissy when they didn\u2019t get exactly what they wanted even though what they wanted had yet to be communicated."]}
