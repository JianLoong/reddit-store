One I'm taking now is an intro to photoshop course, in which we submitted drafts of our final project. the project is a \"surreal\" photoshop collage and \"exemplary\" examples were provided in the assignment itself on Canvas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, I submitted my draft after days of editing and pouring over the examples and various sources provided (by the professor) for photos/resources throughout the course. I was really excited and proud of what I put together. Well, the commentary on my draft came through and the grade itself wasn't was I was hoping for, but that's not what got to me.\n\nWhat pissed me off was the complete lack of actual suggestions or critiques. The definition of surrealism was copy/pasted into the notes of the assignment by the professor, with no comments on the content of my work other than telling me I had to start over completely.  No notes on how to make something more fitting in the image or how what I provided could be adjusted to be more fitting. Nope, just told to start over. I work full time and I'm in school full time, I thought I'd be spending time on revisions and not an entirely new project. I simply don't have time available in the week with my other courses as well to go back and forth with her about more drafts. Not to mention, one of the examples provided was literal planes flying in arbitrary space through bubbles. Wow, so surreal...\n\nSo I replied in the comments essentially saying as much. I told her I would've appreciated actual feedback on the work I provided instead of being told to start over entirely with no real critiques on my work. I said I would provide a brand new project if that was what she wanted, but I also wanted to ensure that my inability to fit a both a new rough draft AND new final draft into 1/3 of the original amount of provided time will not result in docked points, and only one final project will be provided by me. I also asked her not to copy/paste dictionary definitions at me, as it's pretty condescending and unnecessary. My final suggestion was to pull the \"exemplary example\" from the assignment description, as it's no more surreal than the project I submitted.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not asking for a higher grade and I plan to concede to her request for a brand new project, but I wanted to share my disappointment that the one assignment that wasn't \"make this picture look exactly like what I did\" was the one that received literally zero actual criticism. I was venting to my sister (a teacher) who told me that I was rude and undermining her intent for the assignment or something? Why be a professor if you're not going to give actual, constructive criticisms on students' work?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: alright y'all, I get it, I suck.

Go to their office hours, meet with them after class, send them an email, etc. \n\nYou went full scorched earth wayyy too quickly.", "YTA\n\nYou were absolutely obnoxious, and the irony of you calling HER condescending is . . . wow.\n\nSince you seem to be more than a bit obtuse, let me clarify for you: her giving you the dictionary definition of surrealism and asking you to start over from scratch WAS a critique, and a very, very kind one. It was her incredibly gentle way of letting you know that you were so far off the mark with what you submitted that you didn't even seem to understand the concept, or what surrealism means. She gave you the dictionary definition and asked you to start again because it was KINDER than having to actually say to you, point-blank, \"What you submitted is so far outside the parameters of the assigment that I'm concerned that you don't even understand what we're talking about.\" So she very gently, kindly, gave you the clearest definition possible of what she is looking for, and asked you to begin again. \n\nShe wasn't being patronising, she was giving you a second chance whilst trying not to embarrass you. And you responded with obnoxious vitriol and condescension. Yikes. \n\nAs someone else noted, if you genuinely had a problem with how she responded, you could have asked to speak to her. Instead you assumed that you were in the right, that she was doing something wrong, and attacked her angrily. Literally everything about your premise was mistaken. That seems to be a trend with you. So yes, YTA.", "YTA\n\nIf you want feedback or help on how you can improve your grade, *you fucking ask*. Send them an *polite* email or ask to meet them during their office hours.\n\nTalking that way to a professor is a pretty good way to sabatoge yourself.", "i can see how it would be frustrating to be graded like you didn't understand what the professor wanted, without being given any helpful instructions to improve.\n\nbut the way you responded was way over the top. just saying you were surprised by the grade and would appreciate some constructive feedback in their own words would've been fine, but your sister is right. you were rude. YTA.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are delusional.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" with no comments on the content of my work other than telling me I had to start over completely.\" .. your work was THAT bad?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and I plan to concede to her request for a brand new project,\" .. this is not a request. It is what you have to do for a passing grade.", "Instead of telling her why everything she did was wrong why not just ask the question? How would you suggest I improve my new submission? \n\nPerhaps, she felt the assignment directions were very clear & you did not follow directions. If that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s nothing to critique. You just did not do the assignment. \n\nIt appears you have a lot on your plate & maybe took your frustrations out on the wrong person.\n\nYTA", "You criticized your professor I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. I think this falls under the know your audience category.", "YTA.  \n\nShe sent you the definition of surrealism because apparently, judging by your comment \u201cwow, so surreal,\u201d you don\u2019t know what artistic surrealism is. Outside of school, you\u2019ll be expected to understand what a client wants when they ask for your services for an artistic interpretation or style done in photoshop. Apparently, your default mode is to be led by the nose and then complain about the way someone speaks to you. When you hit the real world what will you do when your employer or client tells you you don\u2019t understand the assignment? Will you flip on them too or will you take what communication they give you, and figure it out? Admit that you didn\u2019t understand what surrealism is, and start over. The working world will fire you or find someone else for their projects if you can\u2019t understand or research a simple visual concept.", "YTA. It's understandable that you feel frustrated and disappointed with the feedback you received on your draft for the Photoshop collage project. It can be disheartening when you put in a lot of effort and receive minimal guidance in return. However, it's important to approach the situation with professionalism and respect, both in your interactions with your professor and in your venting to others.\r When expressing your concerns to your professor, it's crucial to maintain a polite tone and focus on your desire for constructive criticism. While it's valid to express your disappointment in the lack of feedback, it's important to do so in a respectful manner. Emphasize your willingness to learn and improve, and ask for specific suggestions on how you can make the project more fitting or how your existing work could be adjusted. By doing this, you demonstrate your commitment to the assignment and your desire to understand and meet the professor's expectations.\r It's worth considering that your professor may have limited time available to provide detailed feedback, especially if they have a large number of students or other responsibilities. While this doesn't excuse the lack of feedback, it can help to contextualize the situation. However, it's still reasonable to expect some form of constructive criticism or guidance to help you improve.\r Regarding your sister's perspective as a teacher, it's important to consider her point of view. She might have felt that your response to the professor was too confrontational or could be interpreted as undermining the professor's intent for the assignment. Remember that constructive communication can lead to better outcomes, even if you feel frustrated. Engaging in a respectful dialogue can help you clarify your concerns and potentially reach a more satisfactory resolution.\r In conclusion, while your disappointment with the lack of feedback is understandable, it's important to approach the situation with professionalism and respect. Seek constructive criticism from your professor, demonstrate your willingness to improve, and maintain open communication channels to ensure a productive learning experience.", "YTA\n\nThere is a better way to approach the situation rather than saying you \n\n>would've appreciated actual feedback on the work I provided\n\nI'm sorry but that is backhanded rude to the extreme. She is a professor and they mark your work as you see fit. If you want additional feedback ask to speak with her in person or over a call if possible to get a better idea of where you went wrong. \n\nTo translate what you told her:\n\nYour marking isnt good enough for me to understand what I need to change. Also dont sound condescending when MARKING my work.", "ESH\n\nTelling a student to start over with no substantive feedback seems lazy on the professor's part but then they can be extremely overworked and you didn't even ask just immediately started insulting them. Telling them to change their course material was a step too far.\n\nI get your frustration and I do think some of it is justified but you could have asked politely first, maybe they didn't have time, maybe they didn't bother because they felt most students would not care. You really should have asked politely first.\n\nBut also, this is not a battle you are likely to win this way even if you were 100% in the right. Not every battle is worth fighting.", "YTA This isn't how you approach a professor for help. You needed to ask for a meeting to go over specifics. Instead, you were rude and attacked your professor.", "YTA. Have you ever instructed before? What makes you think that you are more qualified than her to suggest how she should be teaching? \n\nYou should have raised your concerns or asked for specific feedback after you got her notes or explained that you didn\u2019t understand what the instructor was looking for. Its fine to ask more from your prof but what you did was talk to down to her and demand a certain grade. \n\n\nDoing multiple iterations and revisions is not uncommon in the visual arts profession. In fact, doing multiples helps you develop skills in the long run.", "YTA. Were you one of those kids in school when you were younger who would have your mommy or daddy go and demand your teacher give you a better grade when you didn't like the one you were given...?", "Yeah, no. The correct response would have been to send your professor a professional and POLITE email requesting a one-on-one meeting during their office hours to discuss where your misunderstanding of the assignment occurred and what improvements could be made. Perhaps if you had come together you could of came up with some middle ground between what she was expecting and what you had already done, so you wouldn\u2019t have to completely start over again. Unfortunately, that may no longer be an option after you lost your temper and took your stress out on her.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t high school. Your an adult now. Professors are not expected to (nor do they have too) hold your hand through out the process. You were so far off the mark the professor literally told you to start over. At that point I\u2019m pretty sure little notes and comments in the margins wouldn\u2019t have mattered that much and would have also just been a waste of the professors time. The professor was kind enough to allow her students to submit and grade a draft before they sent in their final project. Keep in mind that the grade you got for the draft could of been your final grade. Situations like this are EXACTLY why she set this up in the first place. Show some respect and gratitude. As I said, you\u2019re an adult and this is YOUR education. Therefore, it\u2019s YOUR responsibility to seek THEM out for help and clarification when you need it. YTA.", "NTA\n\nShitty teachers exist, seems like you stumble upon one. You were right to except actual criticisms on your work, not just generic crap.", "YTA - there was a nicer way to ask for additional feedback and there was no need to even mention the pasted definitions at all. I also don't think it's your place to tell her what examples to use or not use.\n\nYou could have just explained that you would appreciate more specific feedback.", "Professors vary significantly in many qualities, including things as basic as how well they can communicate their thoughts, how much time they have for each student, and how much they care about teaching in the first place.\n\nPaying (usually) thousands of dollars for a class, and then not being given basic courtesy in response can be very frustrating, and there isn't guaranteed to be anything you can do about it. The most likely route to success, if it isn't too late, is to drop this class and try again with a different professor.\n\nI want to be very clear that the professor disrespected you first, and that means you are NTA for responding in kind (or slightly kinder).\n\nBut. This is not likely to get you more useful feedback. Office hours, a polite email, talking to other students, or asking a teacher's assistant (if there is one) would all be better ways to get actionable feedback.", "NTA and if you continue to not get feedback go to the dean. The copy pasted definition is not feedback and i absolutely cannot understand the perspective of other commenters saying you should have just rolled over and started a new project.", "She is the professor and you are the student.  She is the superior and you are the inferior.  She has authority and you do not.  Know your place.\n\nYou can't chastise a person in authority over you and expect good things to happen.  Just dumb.  You will antagonize them and make an enemy when you could have changed your approach and gotten the help you wanted and made a strong ally.  Instead of being angry and disrespectful you could have asked to schedule a meeting for the purpose of getting more clarity on your grade and her feedback.  Then gone over everything you wanted.  Most professors would be happy as hell to have a student genuinely interest in learning. She would have been on your side in the future.\n\nNot now though.  \n\nMaybe you will smarten up and beg for forgiveness.\n\nYTA, disrespectful, stupid comment to make to a person with authority over you.", "lol YTA. How obnoxious can you be?", "NTA. Your response is that of a mature, competent adult in the process of learning a new skill. You are absolutely right to expect constructive, detailed notes and explanations how to do better. In this scenario, the professor's role is that of an art director, and she should have given you specific pointers how to achieve the results she expected. Both your professor and your sister appear to see you as a child and themselves as adults who can talk down to you. No. Just no. Keep doing what you are doing.

The space is just an element to juxtapose items, it's not saying that surrealism is sci-fi.\n\nIf you did obviously alien creatures in a traditional earth setting, like a 1950s style cookie cutter neighborhood, the juxtaposition of the weird and the normal would be surreal. \n\nI am struggling to think of a way to make the obviously alien setting work - maybe you could add very obviously human things to it.

People keep forgetting that students PAY teachers! And so it makes no sense for the students to go out of their way and do everything. What is the teacher there for? What are they teaching that isn\u2019t free online ? One would think is the feedback loop. Wich helps students directly understand the material and what they did wrong instead of just the free definition of the word everyone can google.

Maybe she just had the students google surrealism and worked it out themseleves- wouldn\u2019t be far fetched considering she couldn\u2019t even bother explaining it in her own words and instead copy pasted google definitions. \n\n3: it\u2019s the teachers JOB to provide feedback.

This advice is a great way for the OP to mortify themselves.", "You comparing my attempts at furthering my education while already a member of the workforce to a 19 year old dunce crashing his car is laughably inaccurate.", "Ah... I actually really feel for you. It sounded like you did your due diligence in trying to clarify with the teacher on multiple assignments but they have a history of ignoring you. It's really not cool. When a teacher is teaching an online class, it's up to them to be available for clarifying questions.\n\nPersonally, I think the only thing you could have done better was not to go full \"scorched earth\" in your response (i.e. releasing all your frustrations on the teacher in a reactionary manner). I agree that the teacher sounds like a terrible communicator, but flying off the handle likely won't yield a result of making your own life easier. However I completely understand that sometimes in fits of emotion, we make mistakes. That is human.\n\nPersonally, if it were me... I would probably write to the professor apologize ONLY for the harsh and reactionary manner in which I delivered my frustrations. I would make sure to say that I do still feel frustrated about the lack of clear constructive criticism, and that it would be extremely helpful if we (you and the teacher) could open up a dialogue to help me get a grasp on surrealism and the assignment. It's literally the teacher's job to do this, so if they won't help you then they're truly just an awful teacher. In that case, if I were you I'd just say fck it and do the assignment as best I could. Unfortunately, sometimes crappy teachers make it hard to receive an exceptional grade, and we just have to suck it up and accept that. In cases like that, it's often less mentally taxing to let it go.", "That\u2019s great stock feedback though. It\u2019s exactly what OP needed in this case.", "I would also suggest that if the student's work was so far out of scope that they needed to start from scratch the professor might have felt like they couldn't give any more specific feedback than \"this doesn't work, here's the definition and start again\"\n\nOP stated they gave a bunch of examples and sources - what else is the prof really supposed to do? If the problem lies within OPs understanding of surrealism as a concept then specific critiques on the piece itself aren't actually beneficial to OP. If I have an assignment to paint something monochromatic and I turn in something that has blues and oranges, specific critiques about my piece beyond \"this isn't monochromatic, here's the definition of monochromatic\" don't really matter at this point because those aren't the reason the piece isn't getting a passing mark. \n\nGetting OP to understand surrealism is the point and the professor probably doesn't want to inadvertently confuse them with other feedback until that core concept is understood.\n\nAnd it's not as though surrealism is a secret, a quick Google will lead you to a mountain of information about what surrealism is. A part of post-secondary education is learning how to find information for yourself and determine the right kind of questions to ask when you need more specificity. \n\nSo OP missed the feedback that they don't understand the core concept, missed the opportunity to re-evaluate their piece with the knowledge that it doesn't fit the brief, missed the opportunity to set up a meeting with their professor to ask specific questions and missed the opportunity to do some of their own research to try and understand better - instead, they decided to post a snotty comment. Yeesh.", "That's fair enough, and believe me, I feel compassion for teachers who don't have time to go into a full-blown, in-depth critique of every assignment. I'm guessing the vast majority of the time, such a critique isn't feasible. At least with your copy/paste message you are opening up dialogue and inviting students to talk about it more in-depth if they need to.\n\nBut I do think that if OP's teacher hadn't already established a pattern of not answering requests for assignment clarification (discussed in some of OP's comments), OP probably wouldn't have flown off the handle. I'm not saying OP was in the right for flying off the handle. But if the teacher had a history of being good about responding and clarifying, OP's emotional response probably wouldn't have been so strong. Even though it is true that teachers are often overloaded with students and work (and they should definitely be appreciated more), the most fundamental aspect of their job is to help a student understand. When a teacher ignores questions for clarification, they are not fulfilling their basic job.", "If it is not feasible for a professor to actually do what is required to teach people who are paying to learn from her, then the professor should refund the students.  It\u2019s roughly 30K a year for university.  That is a lot of money to give excuses for why you can\u2019t teach the students who pay to learn.  BS as a s matter of fact.

At a certain point, it\u2019s up to you, the adult student, to set up an appointment with the professor, if you still don\u2019t understand the premise of an assignment.

Nope, just told to start over.\n\n,\n>To be clear, I'm not asking for a higher grade and I plan to concede to her request for a brand new project, but I wanted to share my disappointment that the one assignment that wasn't \"make this picture look exactly like what I did\" was the one that received literally zero actual criticism.\n\n\nYou may want to read it more closely. Op has been clear that what she wanted was guidance on what was actually wrong with the assignment so she could do it properly the 2nd time.

They talk about spending days poring over the provided examples to make sure they got it right, and then how proud they were of the result. That doesn't sound like a student who doesn't care. \n\nAs for the \"massive amount of material about it\"... I'm not sure where you're seeing that in the post.
