This is her second marriage as she divorced my birth father when i was 8. I was diagnosed with autism shortly after my father left, and i am convinced that she thinks my father\u2019s absence is my fault. I\u2019ve always been difficult to handle, very emotional and sensitive especially in social situations. I\u2019ve only ever had a few friends and my mother thinks that the reason my father left is because of the difficulty of raising me.\n\nMy mother met a man that we will call David 2 years ago. They hit it off instantly and he proposed a few months ago. I wasnt originally planning on attending the wedding due to my fear of social situations, I was worried about having a panic attack or becoming overstimulated but i was pressured into coming by my mother.\n\nThroughout the wedding i wore my noise cancelling headphones which help me to feel more comfortable in crowds. Mostly keeping to myself, i wasnt feeling too bad at the start. After the marriage my brother approached me and took me to the table where everyone was talking. My mother noticed me immediately and signalled for me to take off my headphones so she could speak to me, but made an offensive comment about my introverted behaviour. She and her friends laughed at me and nobody was there to stand up for me.\n\nMy whole life she has disliked me and made me feel ashamed of my disability. She\u2019s always forced me to get involved in conversations and attend parties and meetups with my classmates when i was in school and she was very clearly happy when i moved out, although she had never blatantly disrespected me in front of a group of people like this, and this was my breaking point. I swore at her and stormed out of the wedding, her friends shouting abuse at me as i walked out. I was later told that she spent the rest of the dinner crying and that her wedding was \u2018ruined\u2019. I am now being told off by all my family members and being told how selfish and childish i was acting on her wedding.

Then yeah you would have been over the top.", "NTA. Fuck cry bullies.", "NTA. It almost seems like your mom purposely provoked you so she could play the victim. Sorry OP, that sucks.", "NTA.

She can dish it out but she can't take it.", "ESH\n\nIn my opinion you already felt self-conscious and out of place and your reaction was excessive for what your mother did, in this particular instance.\n\nMaybe you overreacted due to a build up of resentment.  \n\nHas your mom ever said she doesnt like or that you should be ashamed of your disability or is that just how you think she feels?  Because sometimes people project what they themselves are feeling onto others, usually those who are closest to them.\n\nIf makes sense that your mom would want you to take the headphones off if she wanted to have a conversation with you. Making a single comment to you that you found offensive was not ideal, but i dont think one comment should warrant what you did in response, which marred a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" important event.  Instead of swearing, could you not have calmly said, \" your comment hurts my feelings, please dont make other comments like that?", "NTA\n\nSo she still just cares about the fact that her big day was \"ruined\" because her son took offense to being disrespected because of his disability in public. All the while you were just trying not to cause a bigger scene and didn't even want to be there because of this very reason in the first place. Sounds like she just wanted you there to keep up her image among her friends and family.", "Certainly NTA. Some social situations can be terrifying, especially when not many people have empathy. The fact that she was the one forcing you to socialise and taking away your only sense of security (your headphones) only to blatantly made fun of you in front of a group of people is just cruel. I believe she knew exactly how you'll react and milked as much reactions from people as she could especially given that it was on her wedding day, too.", "If she didn\u2019t love you, she wouldn\u2019t have invited you in the first place. You were both wrong, she should have probably asked you to stay home and you really can\u2019t have a conversation if you\u2019re wearing headphones.", "NTA - Keep being you.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t ruin anything she was the 1 that did that, who the hell insults their child like that. Might be her wedding day but doesn\u2019t mean she can just do and say whatever she wants.", "Well, you are very aware of your limitations why did you go. You are an adult and if you can\u2019t handle being in a crowd you should not go to these things.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t expect you to be included in anything after this. Your disability makes it where you cannot handle crowds.", "Nta you deserve a better mom. I\u2019m sorry", "NTA. Your mother made a point to talk to you and to insult you in front of people who then laughed at you. She then threw a fit when you stood up for yourself and refused to be her entertainment for the night and let her bully you in front of her guests. If this is the case, she deserved to have her wedding ruined. \n\nWhat I hope has happened is that people who aren\u2019t familiar with your family dynamics saw what your mother did called her out for her behavior and she (and the rest of the family) are blaming you for this as opposed to taking responsibility for their actions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm a teacher, and while I 100% understand why my Autistic students get uncomfortable, the fact is that they will find themselves in uncomfortable situations. They have to learn how to properly cope with those scenarios. I'm not certain if Mom forced OP into uncomfortable situations, as much as she exposed him to them so that he could deal with them.

I don't think we have enough information to say who is the AH here.", "NTA and tell your family that you have had enough of her cruel behavior towards you and also ask them why they care so much about her tears but not your tears.

She\u2019s upset because karma has finally come back to bite her. You owe her nothing. You said she pressured you into coming, so I\u2019m going to assume you still live with her?

I feel that I need this information before I can make a fair judgement.", "Ya bud not the same thing. It works with gas powered dildo though.", "It is the same thing. Nobody wears noise canceling headphones in public because they want to be assholes. OP has a sensory disability that requires they block noises or get overwhelmed.", "INFO: What did she say? The way you describe the events occurred sounds like it may have been subtly affected by how strongly you feel about the situation, but it\u2019s hard to tell as the reader. Your feelings are valid, but may also skew the nuance in your account of events, so what happened on that wedding likely does reflect your mom\u2019s general struggle or incompetence in appropriately dealing with you, making her comment hurt even more as it hit a sore spot. But maybe you weren\u2019t exactly bullied away the way you said you were, it depends on her comment a lot. Tough situation. I do believe people dislike you less than you feel they do, though they can still be clumsy and hurtful. Best of luck.", "I'm leaning toward NTA, but like others here want more INFO on what she said.", "NTA"]}
