Additionally I work on a specialized team in a small office within the larger office.\n\nYesterday, a coworker (A) who my team was previously friends with came into our office and explained to us that she had been out at the end of last week because her husband was having surgery. While he was being prepped, they found a mass in his throat. It was biopsied and is being checked, and I genuinely hope it comes back as benign. After telling us how they found the mass, A told us a story about how she had found a singular bed bug on her pillow once, and flipped her house upside down. She didn\u2019t find any others and everything was fine, and \u201cHow good is God that He woke me up at the exact right moment\u201d. And then she tied that story back in to telling us about the mass by saying the surgeon finding it was a \u201cGod moment\u201d. \n\nNow, I do not begrudge people believing in miracles and perfect timing. I don\u2019t even begrudge people thanking God for things in my presence because my trauma is my own to handle.

If I were to bring up my religion (polytheism) people would look at me sideways (in my specific office, at least). \n\nIt is important to note that I said none of this directly to A, nor to anyone else in my office.

But your trauma and your beliefs don't dictate what others can do. You need to manage your trauma and get help for it,  because it's affecting your life - it's affected the way you can be around others in the workplace. A lot of the world is religious and you will encounter religious people and need to be able to cope with that. If you can't, it's better to get help so this doesn't affect you more in the future. You can choose to just not be part of a conversation.

Now I know you mentioned that other coworkers mention God and their church at work as well- but if these are just old church ladies talking to each other about church events, sermons they've gone to, stuff like that; then that's not really preaching either.

Why hate on her for her beliefs? Just bcz you feel you cannot say what you believe in. This is your own insecurity and you're talking abt sth that didn't happen.

It is in fact really, really annoying and frustrating, and all the comments saying Y T A because \u201cyou could talk about your deities if you wanted to\u201d are overlooking how religious microaggressions work. The incidents you listed aren\u2019t proselytizing or anything, and I wouldn\u2019t say these ladies are TA for those comments, but based on my experience I\u2019m sure that you hear that kind of stuff on a daily basis and it *is* actually a dick move to turn a secular workplace into a de facto Christian environment. I got so fed up at hearing people say \u201cthank you Jesus\u201d all day long when basic things went right in a hospital office, then being super weird any time my Judaism came up. Anyway, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for posting what you posted, but you shouldn\u2019t be too surprised that it came back to bite you.

Just as you should be able to share your joy about your pantheon in the workplace. \n\nI'm a polytheist as well and at this point in my very Catholic workplace, they find it the least odd thing about me and I'm very open about it. I don't necessarily have a \"Isn't Thor good?\" moment, but that's a difference in how my faith sees godly intervention. Perhaps see if you can be more open about your faith, but if you feel uncomfortable that's on you. It's not on your coworkers to never bring up their own faith at work (unless they are literally proselytizing). \n\nAlso, sometimes folks complain about work online.
