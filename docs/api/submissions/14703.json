Additionally I work on a specialized team in a small office within the larger office.\n\nYesterday, a coworker (A) who my team was previously friends with came into our office and explained to us that she had been out at the end of last week because her husband was having surgery. While he was being prepped, they found a mass in his throat. It was biopsied and is being checked, and I genuinely hope it comes back as benign. After telling us how they found the mass, A told us a story about how she had found a singular bed bug on her pillow once, and flipped her house upside down. She didn\u2019t find any others and everything was fine, and \u201cHow good is God that He woke me up at the exact right moment\u201d. And then she tied that story back in to telling us about the mass by saying the surgeon finding it was a \u201cGod moment\u201d. \n\nNow, I do not begrudge people believing in miracles and perfect timing. I don\u2019t even begrudge people thanking God for things in my presence because my trauma is my own to handle.

If I were to bring up my religion (polytheism) people would look at me sideways (in my specific office, at least). \n\nIt is important to note that I said none of this directly to A, nor to anyone else in my office. I did, however post it to my Facebook during a bathroom break. I used vague language, and didn\u2019t even mention the discussion that led to my venting.

But your trauma and your beliefs don't dictate what others can do. You need to manage your trauma and get help for it,  because it's affecting your life - it's affected the way you can be around others in the workplace. A lot of the world is religious and you will encounter religious people and need to be able to cope with that. If you can't, it's better to get help so this doesn't affect you more in the future. You can choose to just not be part of a conversation.

Now I know you mentioned that other coworkers mention God and their church at work as well- but if these are just old church ladies talking to each other about church events, sermons they've gone to, stuff like that; then that's not really preaching either.

Why hate on her for her beliefs? Just bcz you feel you cannot say what you believe in. This is your own insecurity and you're talking abt sth that didn't happen.

It is in fact really, really annoying and frustrating, and all the comments saying Y T A because \u201cyou could talk about your deities if you wanted to\u201d are overlooking how religious microaggressions work. The incidents you listed aren\u2019t proselytizing or anything, and I wouldn\u2019t say these ladies are TA for those comments, but based on my experience I\u2019m sure that you hear that kind of stuff on a daily basis and it *is* actually a dick move to turn a secular workplace into a de facto Christian environment. I got so fed up at hearing people say \u201cthank you Jesus\u201d all day long when basic things went right in a hospital office, then being super weird any time my Judaism came up. Anyway, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for posting what you posted, but you shouldn\u2019t be too surprised that it came back to bite you.

Just as you should be able to share your joy about your pantheon in the workplace. \n\nI'm a polytheist as well and at this point in my very Catholic workplace, they find it the least odd thing about me and I'm very open about it. I don't necessarily have a \"Isn't Thor good?\" moment, but that's a difference in how my faith sees godly intervention. Perhaps see if you can be more open about your faith, but if you feel uncomfortable that's on you. It's not on your coworkers to never bring up their own faith at work (unless they are literally proselytizing). \n\nAlso, sometimes folks complain about work online.

Dude what did you expect?!", "As someone who believes in Zeus don\u2019t act so glib\n\nDepending on where you are expressing differing religious views can potentially lead to harassment. \n\nI\u2019m fairly open about my religion and yes do call on the appellation of Zeus or other gods but I don\u2019t live in Hicksville. I\u2019ve always lived in cities. Like my sexuality it\u2019s never been an issue but might be for others", "Perfect solution. I'm an atheist so I like to say, \"Thank science\".", "May I has how it\u2019s disrespectful? /genuine. I would like to understand so I don\u2019t repeat my mistakes.", "I was never friends with A. B shared my post with her.", "She can be passive aggressive on social media", "Is it not as widely accepted though in your country? I've never heard of Hinduism (in its polytheistic form) being less accepted than Islam, for example.", "I\u2019ve known A for several years; she\u2019s a friend of my mother and sisters. She\u2019s aware of my trauma, and has been known to use any and every opportunity to talk about God previously. This time it hit me different, since she\u2019s been treating me differently since my transition started. I didn\u2019t see my post as pass/agg since I didn\u2019t have her on FB and so didn\u2019t expect her to see it, and since my venting was general, not specifically about her. Her comment was a catalyst, not the driving reason.", "Sorry, do you know what benign means? It means \u201cnot bad\u201d. As in, I hope the results come back negative for cancer or anything else harmful. Like. I hope the results come back and say he\u2019s okay. I wouldn\u2019t wish a malignant tumor on anyone.", "I used to have that as a hard and fast rule. I\u2019ve worked with B for three years now, and we were close until I started transitioning. Since then she\u2019s been different with me. I never imagined she\u2019d share a post of mine with another coworker like this, especially because we both used to agree on this kind of topic. But, lesson reinforced, ig. Nothing is private on the internet.", "Getting fired. A hostile work place\u2026 \n\nIf OP works Demeter where coworkers get away with being so preachy at work it is definitely not safe for them to be out as a Pagan.", "I'll be as glib as I want to be. I don't give a shit if you believe in Zeus just like I don't give a shit if people believe in Jesus. Everyone's entitled to be as deluded as they want to be, and I am entitled to be as glib about their delusions as I want to be. You aren't special.", "How do you feel when people have an issue with you, but instead of talking about it with you they go behind your back and talk about it with everyone else? People are not going to be able to trust sharing things with you in fear you are going to complain about them on the internet. I can't grasp why you think it is okay.", "OP's primary complaint is that these people are passive aggressive towards them. It's hypocritical to behave in the same manner. On a public forum, no less.", "You\u2019re absolutely right, OP can be passive aggressive, that\u2019s a completely okay thing to be. But you cannot be oblivious to the consequences of those actions and expect sympathy. Op made their bed, now they have to lay in it.", "I live in an Islamic country (thankfully not as strict as iran or anything) but people don\u2019t really think about polytheistic people. you\u2019re either muslim, christian or jewish and anything else is \u2018foreign\u2019", "Oops, you're right sorry. I did momentarily forget, my bad", "It\u2019s not about the damn religions it\u2019s about the environment. You don\u2019t have to be an edgy atheist to realize that. Hostile work environments are fairly common and don\u2019t lead to a payout or recriminations typically.", "If their Facebook isn\u2019t public then it\u2019s not really a public forum but they should likely do a clean up of their friends list", "Sorry, I should've specified I was talking about Western countries (where any religious person who is not Christian risks being discriminated), as from the post I presume OP lives in one. If you live in the Middle East specifically, the fact that the three main monotheistic religions are from that area definitely plays a role in what you're saying though, doesn't it?", "And?  You still choose to be silent or not. Allowing other people to judge you into silence doesn't change anything. Simmering in resentment about how you can't be free to be you when it's a choice you make ...doesn't change the fact.  You either bow to the herd, or remain silent and things go on as they are.  Or you say fuck it and do what you want to do.   \n\nBut don't blame other people for oppressing you, when what you really want is to equally oppress them. \"I don't feel comfortable talking about MY religion, so NOBODY CAN.\"  Please.  Get over your special, special feelings.", "You post like someone who has little to lose. \n\nWhen you have people who depend on you and understand just how much errant words can cost you, you'll understand that people in the real world aren't willing to risk being fired or blacklisted, and would rather go for mutual nonaggression.\n\nHopefully you won't have to learn that lesson firsthand.", "That\u2019s not at all how the world works in a lot of places \n\n\u201cBeing your true self\u201d isn\u2019t an option as it risks being fired, harassment and in more extreme cases murdered. Statistically OP is extremely likely for all those \n\nOP also didn\u2019t \u201coppress\u201d these people by making a vent", "LOL.. I adore people who think that other people being brave and refusing to take shit is because they have nothing to lose. \n\nYou aren't a slave. You have choices.  You're responsible for where you are at this moment in time and what you choose to do with your time. \n\nYou've chosen every single one of your present day circumstances, from the job you're in, to the children you have. \n\nThat's the real world, sugar.  And it's not \"mutual non aggression\" when you're whining to the world about how unfair you are being treated by other people being allowed to live their lives.  That's the definition of aggression. Passive, but still aggression. \n\nCowardice is cowardice.  No matter what excuses you make to justify it.  But it's okay.  There' smore people like you, willing to bend over and take it, than there are people willing to make a stand.  That's why the world is in the state we are.  Because the people willing to FIGHT for shit, tend to want to fight for the wrong things. \n\nBut don't think they're the only problem.  The cowardice of the knee-benders is equally to blame.  Because you know, you can't fight the real world, you just bend your neck to it.", "Live on your knees all you want.  Some people prefer eating dirt, to taking a stand. \n\nIt's still a choice.", "Thank you for reaffirming my earlier perception. :)\n\nIt's very easy to make such sweeping declarations and wide ranging judgements when you have no skin in the game, when you're not impacted personally, and when you don't know it can about the stakes riding on the consequences. Such is the major flaw of this board: the people giving advice frequently either would never follow the selfsame advice they offer, or they will never have to deal with the fallout of the consequences of their advice.\n\nIt's not about being unwilling to fight. It's understanding that your actions have consequences, and deciding \"Is it really worth losing my job, career, home, and more to be **right** in an argument that at the end of the day has no real world impact.\"\n\nDon't lecture me on the value of picking fights. I've got the scars you've yet to accumulate."]}
