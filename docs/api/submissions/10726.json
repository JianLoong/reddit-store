Simply say, wish I could help but I don\u2019t have the cash.", "NTA - especially as it not his first time being picked up recently. If he skips bail it falls on you and based on his living situation it sounds like he probably will be in trouble again.

His girlfriend is trying to guilt me into doing it but she was the reason he got arrested in the first place.\n\nYou really need to revaluate this association. Unless you just enjoy toxic messes then carry on.", "NTA.\n\nConsider: what is the purpose of the bail system? It is a flawed system, but it doesn't exist for no reason.\n\nIf the people closest to an accused offender do not trust them enough not to re-offend before a court date, then why should the police/court? The whole point of this system is that someone who knows the person's character has to put their money where their mouth is.\n\nYou have weighed it up and believe it to be a poor gamble. That reflects badly on him, not you.", "As someone who has been there and done that you're definitely NTA. Absolutely do not co-sign especially if you think he will violate the terms.", "NTA - your friend made a mistake and must live with the consequences.  With what you said, you run the risk of losing any money you put in should he skip bail.  He has proven himself unreliable and unwilling to learn from his mistakes.  If his girlfriend, the reason behind his arrest wants him to be released, then it is up to her to do it on her own.", "NTA you need to remove yourself from this situation.", "NTA because if he gets arrested for breaking the law again, which is what he's doing, you won't get your money back.", "NTA don\u2019t touch this", "You know a lot of bonding companies will make you put up your house or car as collateral right? You willing to risk turning over your vehicle to the bounty hunter?", "Maybe it's time to reevaluate your friend group.", "NTA", "Never \"loan\" anything to a friend/family you can't afford to lose, because odds are it's not coming back. That is a good thing to apply to everything in life \u2014 money, cars, computers, etc. You don't need to go into debt if/when he violates the conditions of his release. NTA.", "NTA; By cosigning for bail you are making yourself accountable for his appearance in court.  If he has been picked up twice in 1 month, either law enforcement has a bone to pick, or he is making a habit of being a suspect. \n\nI would reccomend you take a step back and keep it to verbal and emotional support.", "There is an old saying that describes this situation. It's called 'throwing good money after bad'.", "NTA. \n\n>His total bail is only 3500 but I don\u2019t have that lying around rn either.\n\nHe did the crime and has to deal with the consequences. Plus, you don't have the money lying around in the first place. It's not your problem to deal with. If the girlfriend is the reason he is in there and she wants him out, she should be paying. You shouldn't have to put yourself in debt because your friend is irresponsible.", "NTA - You should do yourself a favor and avoid both of these people. Nothing good can come of these relationships.

Unless you have $3500 that you were planning on setting on fire.", "Never cosign anything for anyone.\n\nWhen they stop paying, and they almost always stop paying you will be on the hook for the remaining balance.\n\nNever cosign anything for anyone!!!\n\nNta", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStay out of their toxic relationship. Explain to your friend that you dont have the money and can not help.", "NTA but for heaven's sake do NOT do this! You're going to lose the money.", "NTA, Just tell them that your credit isn't good enough as you called anonymously and asked.", "NTA! You don't own him anything because if he breaks the conditions of his bail you are now on the hook for it.", "NTA when co signing anything, car, an apartment, a bank loan, whatever, you have to decide can you afford to pay that money if the person who is supposed to be paying it, doesn't. Can you afford to be on the hook for it yourself?  With bail it is even more important. If they don't turn up to court or violate the terms of the bond, can you manage never seeing that money again? If it is a struggle to come up with the money in the first place, then the answer is obviously no. Then you add in that they are most likely to violate the terms and there it is, showing you even more that it is not a safe bet. Make your decisions based on logic, not emotional guilt trips and berating.", "NTA, and honestly ***NEVER COSIGN ON A LOAN.***\n\nThey cant get a loan for a reason, so you'd be paying it. The only exception is perhaps your kid is 16 or so, and has no job or credit and you're helping them get a car in their name and were honestly planning on helping buy one anyways. Then, sure it's alright as you're building them credit on what would've been your dime. Otherwise, no way no how.", "NTA. I caved in to the pressure from my on-again/ off- again boyfriend every time he called me from jail or the bail bondsman did. I drained my bank account for that loser. He managed to get arrested a dozen times in a one year period. Please don\u2019t waste your money mom this loser so-called friend.", "Its one of those relationships where they both go batshit crazy and beat the hell out of one another I\u2019m pretty sure not just one way or the other. Not that it justifies it I\u2019ve just known him since like 7th grade so I feel bad for him somewhat.", "Mind you not bad enough to bail him out lol", "They are toxic \ud83d\ude1e"]}
