Can you afford to be on the hook for it yourself?  With bail it is even more important. If they don't turn up to court or violate the terms of the bond, can you manage never seeing that money again? If it is a struggle to come up with the money in the first place, then the answer is obviously no.

I know he's your friend and everything, but can you really trust him to do right or will she be putting him back in jail again when they have another fight. You do not want to be responsible to pay that back if anything happens. Right now, my sister is in the process of hiring a lawyer and trying to stop a bond company from taking money out of her paycheck because she let an ex boyfriend(who she is friends with) mother guilt her into signing one for him. If you really think he will follow the bail terms; do it; but if you have any doubts don't do it. Also, that relationship sounds toxic.

One family member and one coworker. Both would start the physical first and one for sure deserved it and the other is questionable whether she even actually got hit.
