She copies the dance moves of a boy band called Exo, some seeming to be explicit, and whilst friends were over her friend said \"girls do not dance like that\" which she replied with \"I am a man now, I am a sexy Exo boy so it doesn't matter.\" \n\nI want to support my child no matter if my child wants to be a son or daughter, however I am originally from Poland where most people did not speak on the LGBT, so I am confused as to if I should ask my child about her identity because I don't want her to feel scared about being open about it with me or if I should wait if maybe one day she should make the decision to tell me about gender on her own, and I don't want to embarrass her if I'm wrong and she is a girl.", "created_utc": 1676764297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115vvgz/wibta_if_i_asked_my_child_if_they_are_transgender/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am here for you.\"  No need to add anything else, it wuold just plant the seed of your support.  He/she may be testing the gender waters, could be a phase, or could have decided.  In any case they likely have some fear.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be an AH either way, but I don\u2019t think you should force the topic. It sounds like what you really need is advice. I suggest you check in on one of the LGBTQ+ subreddits.", "NAH the best solution imo would be to present yourself as someone who she's safe to be herself around. if that happens to be trans, great. if not, don't push because either she's not ready to tell you or simply not trans. butch/tomboy/GNC type girls exist too, and they also need support from parents.", "You wouldn't be the asshole but since it's a sensitive topic, take the gentle approach. Ask her about her interests. You could start with EXO since she likes them and go from there.", "You're doing great.  Tell your kid that you've noticed their friends calling them \"Other Name\" and ask if they would like you to use that name for them also and also ask your child what pronouns they prefer.\n\nIf your child is transgender, I highly recommend asking them if they want to talk to their school about using their preferred pronouns and preferred name at school.\n\n\nIf your child is transgender, even if they seem to be handling it well, I highly recommend getting them a therapist so they have a safe space to discuss any issues.  Allow your child to choose their own clothes, hairstyle, friends, etc...  It's really important that they feel that they can be the person they are.\n\nAnd if they are transgender, I highly recommend helping them find a college in a few years, where they feel safe and comfortable, as well.", "Try posting to /r/transgender for some guidance on approaching it. As a trans person honestly there's no wrong answer here.\n\nIt really doesn't sound like they are hiding their identity from you if those conversations are happening near you soopenly. So next time you can just say \"so do you prefer \\[male name\\] now? I can call you that!\" and don't actually ask about specific identity labels. That's probably the simplest approach. It shows support and acceptance without forcing a \"bigger\" conversation.\n\nAlso an option to leave a trans pride flag item around the house for them to hide.\n\n(I'm using they/them pronouns as it does not specify gender and it sounds like your child may not actually use she anymore but hasn't specifically requested he either).", "I think you're awesome for asking the question here.  \n\nI don't think you have to directly ask your child if they are transgender.  I think you just let them know that you think they look great, you like their new name, and that you love them always and forever no matter what.  When they're ready to tell you, they'll feel comfortable doing so.", "This isn't really an AITA.\n\nThis is just asking for advice.  \n\nEspecially given what you have described about your home country, you can simply make it clear to them that you do not hold any prejudices over these issues, that you're happy with them no matter what, and they should always feel comfortable speaking with you about anything should they want to.\n\nYou don't have to insert any of your assumptions about them or ask them to come out with it.  Just let them know there will be a soft landing if there's anything to tell.", "Don't ask if they are transgender, ask what her pronouns are. That gives WAY more room for discussion, since gender has such a wide range of expression.", "Just ask them what their pronouns are. This may still be confronting for them so if they blow up a little don\u2019t take it personally. NTA", "We opened the conversation with our kids with asking about their pronouns and sharing ours. I\u2019d try that. She could be still figuring things out. NTA if you take a gentle approach and not make it a big deal.", "NAH. I would advise you let your daughter come to you if she wishes. If she ISNT transgender she might get hurt that you think she might be. If she IS transgender you put her on the spot to either admit shes transgender if shes not ready, or lie to you.", "Just so you know if you ask, your child will probably not tell you even if they are trans. It\u2019s important to most people that they come out on their own terms and on their own time. Just let your kid know that they are safe in your home. You sound like you care so you\u2019re probably doing okay", "Hi OP, Polish trans man (born female, transitioned to male) here! I really appreciate that you\u2019re supportive of your child no matter who they are, that will definitely mean a lot to them as they grow up. \n\nMy recommendation is that you don\u2019t ask them directly if they\u2019re transgender, just because that could make them feel like they either have to lie to you or have to come out earlier than they\u2019re ready, both of which could be bad for them. Instead, just make sure that they know that you\u2019re open to LGBT+ and specifically trans people, and that you love them unconditionally! \n\nThey may be nervous to tell you because we don\u2019t talk about this stuff much, but showing them that you\u2019re okay with it will go a long way towards making them happy and comfortable with you, whether or not your kid is trans themself. Powodzenia, OP! <3\n\nEdit: NTA but there are better ways", "You are NTA in general, that's easy to see just from reading what you wrote. But I would advise against asking outright, it needs to be something your child tells you on their own. you can lead them into it with talks about how you'll love them no matter what and how you'll always be there for them. But if they are trans let them bring it up to you on their own terms.", "YWNBTA but you would be handling it ineffectively if you ask outright. Find ways to show your child that you're a good ally to others of diverse genders, and that you love them unconditionally. Then be patient. If you make it safe and there's anything to tell, then they'll tell you in time.", "NAH, your child might not be ready to say anything to you. Instead, find a natural time to say that you love them and you are always here for them. If you say it enough times maybe your child will be ready to talk to you.", "My husband and I went to breakfast with our oldest.  Born female,  she was the most feminine person I knew.  The arguments we had about covering up for school,  I can't tell you.  At breakfast it was obvious there was a change. They didn't say anything, but I knew.  When we left I asked him if he noticed,  he didn't.  So I started researching transgender to make sure I said the right things as this was very new to me.  He said that I didn't love our child unconditionally.  He all but demanded I ask.  My reading suggested that you let them tell you when they are ready, but I believed my marriage depended on it, so I asked.   I am thankful my child was ready to talk, but I hate that I didn't let them tell me when they were ready.  \n\nI say let them talk to you when they are ready.", "Probably gently bring up the new name, and ask if they would prefer you to start calling them by that name. Your child may be trans, they might not be. At that age they may very well be trying to piece it all together themselves. However, if they are, there\u2019s always a chance they simply aren\u2019t ready to come out to you yet. \n\nasking about the name ONLY gives you a chance to prod, without overstepping very delicate boundaries in what can be a terribly difficult process emotionally and mentally for them. More importantly, it gives them security to decide how much they wish to say up front. They might say yes, and leave it at that, or it might give them the confidence boost to tell you more! \n\nDo not push for information however. Identity is a precious thing for a teen especially. How someone comes out is incredibly important to them and a memory to hold onto for life, don\u2019t take that away by trying to force them to tell you. \n\nBe patient, be kind, and remember that it isn\u2019t in any way about, or reflective of you, and the rest will sort itself out. But YWBTA if you just came up and asked.", "NTA and you sound like a great, attentive parent! \n\nBest to let you child tell you on their own terms - but you can absolutely find reasons to tell them you love them unconditionally, no matter who they grow into as a person.", "Personally I\u2019d say no. Supporting your child is great, but I think they should just figure it out on their own.  When I was 15 I was super masculine. I had a buzz cut, loved Kpop/anime, wore only men\u2019s clothing and was often mistaken for a boy.  I definitely had some gender envy at the time.  I was figuring myself out still with space from any titles.  Let your kid figure themselves out before they ask. They\u2019re only 15 and trying to find out who they are. It\u2019s not always that they\u2019re trans, but they just masculine things.  Let them come out on their own time. They might be embarrassed if you ask if they\u2019re trans when they\u2019re not.  Support your kid from a distance.", "I would wait for her to say something.\n\nAITA may not be the best sub for this post.  Maybe try something r/relationship_advice.  Good luck", "YWBTA if this is the case,  let your child come out to you on their own terms.  You could do things that would give your child the idea that you'd be accepting and open. But let them come in their own time.", "I would say you wouldnt be the asshole perse..but let him tell you on his own terms and for now be supportive", "Perhaps you could bring up a story or a dear abby article and exclaim that any parent should love their child no matter what and that you can't imagine how a parent would stop loving their child just because they are transgender. You could put up a lgbtq+ flag. You could also encourage your child to bring over any transgender or lgbtq+ friends as you house is now a safe haven. I would also talk to pflag families in case my advice is off. Good luck and I'm glad your child has you for a parent!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
