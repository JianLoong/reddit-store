You don't have to forget anything with a calendar handy all the time. YTA", "I don't even use google calendar or any kind of calendar tbh, but it seems difficult to forgot that I want my wedding the same summer as my cousin. Even if I were to forget the exact date I'd still ask them to make sure I'm not messing anything up.", "Yep I don't believe that she \"forgot.\" She's the giant AH.", "I mean me too, but I can kind of understand it since it is local vs. hours by car or a plane ride. That means no hotel costs as well. Just a lot cheaper but it is super crappy to do to someone who has been planning for 2 years!", "The cousin bloody reminded her when she got engaged. Like. There\u2019s. No. Way. No way it wasn\u2019t intentional.", "That whole paragraph is weird to me:\n\n>The issue is that my cousin lives an hours flight away from me and the rest of our family (in the country they grew up in) and most people have decided to come to my wedding as they can\u2019t afford both and mine is local.\n\nI'm guessing non-native english speaker and certainly not American, because to me:\n\n1. An hour long flight (which is how it is written) is nothing, you are basically landing as soon as you finish taking off\n2. If I'm saying the wedding is local, I'm saying you don't need a hotel, or at most you want one for one night, and your travel costs are basically gas\n\nFrom my point of view there would be no reason that someone who could afford to go to the cousin's wedding in the first place couldn't afford both.  Also apparently none of them have made travel arrangements for a wedding taking place in the next couple of months?"]}
