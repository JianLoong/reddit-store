Why isn\u2019t he interfering with her behaviour?", "NTA  She played the FAFO and lost.

Your post doesn't necessarily elude to whether or not she has a history of pettiness, or just over exaggerating. However, you also seem to have handled this whole scenario poorly by basically airing the dirty laundry between you two rather than maybe talking to your son, or whomever is married to DIL about it. Instead of saying \"I can't do the cabin this year due to my leg, please consider coming to my place this year,\" it does sound as if you basically said \"DIL plans suck, come accommodate me instead.\"\n\nAlso, is she the only one complaining? Your concluding comment didn't mention who the texts/calls are from. If it's just her, then I wouldn't worry about it and tell her that she's the only one who seems incapable of accommodating a temporary injury. Basically let her make an ass out of herself if she wants, but you don't need to fuel that fire.", "NTA and what\u2019s the pie?", "NTA since it\u2019s not your fault that your leg is broken.

NTA really good move to just immediately expose her non sense with the text argument recipes!", "ESH\n\nYou and the daughter in law both sound exhausting.  On a surface level reading of this situation I would have said that she is the A, because of course they should make accommodations for your injury and it\u2019s totally unreasonable to expect you to bake and trek out to a mountain cabin on crutches.  You also seem to have a valid point about her overreacting to minor stuff.\n\nReading between the lines even slightly, though, it\u2019s seems like you and DIL are made for each other - the emotional tone of your post and the way that your disputes blow up into huge text arguments spanning the whole family, gives me a strong sense that DIL is not the only \u201cdrama queen\u201d here and you are just as guilty of escalating matters.", "Why on earth would you cede the high ground by calling her a \"petty b*tch?\" \n\nYou know doing that started something new that's going to go on for years. You have caused your own headaches.\n\nJust be right, and act like an adult. You learned many years ago how to conduct yourself. Don't let that girl drag you down.", "ESH - She sounds like a drama queen but so do you. Name calling was unnecessary. \n\nThe facts of the situation were clear enough to everybody else that they moved Thanksgiving to your house over it all. She lost. You didn\u2019t have to rub it in.", "ESH. You\u2019re an adult, don\u2019t call people rude name in group chats. You could have said \u201csorry, with my leg I can\u2019t make the cabin so will need to bow out\u201d with the same result and not come across as an equally crappy person.", "NTA.

No one want to go to an inaccessible cabin that excludes part of the family. Her lack of compassion is why no one is attending her Thanksgiving.  She FAFO.", "She is the one complaining, the rest of the family is on my side ( besides my son but he isn\u2019t happy with her either) due to having to deal with issues of there own before with her.\n\nMy daughter is quite happy since Halloween she made a huge deal about her costume Barbie and she got the wrong address for the party since DIL was mad someone had the same costume as her.\n\nI have a lot of examples of this fun.", "... it didn't span the whole family until DIL uninvited OP from Thanksgiving though?

Disengage and don't fuel the fire.", "He's not doing her any favors either, he's just supporting her in hurting others and alienating herself.

But in this case he is wrong. He should be an adult and talk with her about her behaviour.", "Well, honestly he should tell her that her actions are uncalled for and that she should start behaving like a mature adult. \n\nHe isn't really helping her by not standing up to her tricks, if anything he is enabling her.", "LMAO she thought she was going to be the only person dressed as Barbie on Halloween?", "Ya, absolutely NTA then.

Spouses should be loyal to each other, thats the deal.", "No, actually, there is no \"deal\" that spouses have to back everything the other one does, especially if it's dangerous, hurtful, toxic or harmful to the family. A spouse should SUPPORT their partner by helping them learn and improve their behavior for the benefit of everyone, not jump right to divorce. Really a childish understanding of adult relationships.
