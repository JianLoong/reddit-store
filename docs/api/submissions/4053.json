We've been together for 4 years.\n\nBefore I met him (and for the first year and a half of our relationship) I lived with Tammy (27f). Tammy and I have been best friends since we met at 12/13. Tammy and John have a great relationship, too.\n\nThe issue is with some people in my friend group who I met after John and I got serious. For some reason, they're all obsessed with the 'and they were roommates' joke when it comes to Tammy and I. At first it was kind of funny, but now it's crossed a line and they won't stop. If I casually mention Tammy is coming along to an outing, at least 2 people will make some dirty sex joke about the two of us. She hit really hard times during covid, and John and I let her stay in the guest bedroom. Cue the jokes about having a 'maid' wink wink nudge nudge.\n\nIt makes all three of us uncomfortable and I've tried to get them to stop but because they're my (soon to be) SIL's friends (and I am close with SIL- who doesn't make these jokes) it's been hard to cut them out or distance because of the tangled web of connections.\n\nI should note that I have been very clear that I dislike these jokes and that they're being disrespectful to myself, Tammy and John.\n\nWell, last week we all went out and Tammy came along. I was in no mood for these types of jokes and made a note in my phone of everyone who made a joke and how many times they said it. At the end of the night, we all went back to my place and I stood up and pointed at the 'jokesters' and said 'you're uninvited'. Out of the 8 people who went out with us, 4 were uninvited. I made it very clear why and explained it again so there was no confusion. The 4 who were uninvited, left the apartment.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is on my side but my SIL is now fuming. She's super pissed that I've 'isolated' her from her friends because she's 'obligated' to pick family. I said she can still be friends with them so long as they stop the jokes. **(edit; christ alive, people. I'm not dictating her friendships. this was a part of a much bigger conversation that i was obviously not going to transcribe here. she can still be friends with them if they make those jokes but the bigger picture was that I was not going to be friends with them if they continued to make those jokes).** Naturally, the people who I uninvited are pissed too and there has been a barrage of passive-aggressive instagram posts about it and the money they've spent being wasted.\n\nAITA for uninviting them?", "created_utc": 1670284037, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdohrx/aita_for_last_minute_uninviting_multiple_people/", "score": 677, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stop hanging out with them", "NTA\n\nThey stopped being friends of yours the moment you told them you didn\u2019t think the joke was funny and they kept doing it anyway.", "NTA but also, and I know this is beside the point, but that's really not even how the \"they were roommates\" joke works", "NTA if your SIL is so upset she needs to hold her friends accountable, not blame you for them being uninvited. you\u2019re allowed to invite and uninvite who you please. they wouldn\u2019t stop with the jokes, they deserve it", "NTA. Super weird people are even doing that? Two girls can't be friends? Let alone live together? How are the people who are making the jokes, not getting any of what you've been saying? I would be TIREEEEDDD.", "NTA. And honestly, good for you.", "NTA.\n\nBoundaries. People need to respect them.", "op=NTA\n\nthat is nasty and bullying, you asked them again and again to stop\n\nall you did was uninvite them from your wedding(and i presume social occasions that you host/organize) --which is absolutely your right\n\nyou didn't tell your SIL that she has to unengage with them.\n\nthe uninvited can stick it(to put it semi politely).", "Nta. It sounds like you've made it clear multiple times before this how uncomfortable you are about it and they kept doing it anyway. Sure it could be considered extreme, but at the end of the day it's still the consequences of their actions and you dont have to sit and take it at an event you're organising for you and your partner", "I am just imagining the \"jokesters\" grabbing the mic at your wedding and making more inappropriate jokes. *shudder*\n\nIf the first 42 times you told them didn't get them to stop, they're not stopping now. \n\nNTA", "NTA I\u2019m so confused as to why that\u2019s a joke in the first place, let alone one that keeps being made if you\u2019ve all been clear you don\u2019t care for it.", "INFO why are numerous people suggesting you were having a sexual relationship with a roommate? Maybe you are bi\u2026 but otherwise its common for people to have same-sex roommates so what\u2019s with all of the adolescent (terrible) jokes?", "A joke isn't funny unless everyone is laughing. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I'm imagining this like a movie scene where you are hectically pointing around the table yelling \"And YOU get uninvited, and YOU get uninvited\".", "NTA\n\nThis is YOUR wedding. YOU and your husband decide who gets invited and who doesn\u2019t. \n\nThis is no longer sex jokes, this is *harassment*.\nThey are your SIL\u2019s friends and she is responsible for keeping them in line. You\u2019re bot alienating her from her friends, she can go see them any time she wants \n\nGood for you for standing up for yourself and your husband! I wish you a happy day of union!", "NTA. This was an absolute power move and I love it so much.", "NTA\n\nYou repeatedly told them to stop and they refused. They disrespected you so you cut them out. You did nothing wrong.", "Good on you stand your ground.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.  People who disrespect you over and over again are not your friends and don't deserve to be a part of your special day.  Your sister in law doesn't get a say who comes to the wedding.  It's not her wedding.", "NTA and a smart move on your part. You don\u2019t need them messing up your wedding with more of their \u2018harmless jokes\u2019 via toasts or whatever. They sound like a pack of hyenas.", "You're getting married in two months! How could a guest have possibly have spent money on your wedding yet? They're just playing the poor me role. You're NTA", "NTA. Good for you", "NTA\n\nUninviting people to a wedding is not isolating anyone. It\u2019s ONE event.\n\nAnd it\u2019s unsuprising that you don\u2019t want people at your wedding who make repeated gross jokes about you even after you have told them to stop.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t trust them to not make the same damn jokes at the wedding.", "NTA. This is gross, definitely sexual harassment, and objectifies your friend. Your SIL's friends suck. And since she is well aware of what they're doing and doesnt put a stop to it, she sucks by association", "NTA\n\nThese people are AH about you, your fiance, and your friend. At the end of the day, you can invite who you want at YOUR wedding. AH can't expect to be invited.", "NTA- I commend your composure for actually tolerating this nonsense for as long as you have. Shame on your SIL, especially since she doesn't partake in the jokes. If I was SIL I'd tell them flat out \"Cut it the fk out. The jokes are old, not funny, and very disrespect for to my brother and his wife to be (at the very least).\" \n\nAn invitation is just that you're not obligated to invite people who have continously disrespected you, your best friend, & your soon too be husband. A wedding is so for the people who love & care for the bride & groom. Family, friends, and maybe even colleagues. I can guarantee that those types of jokes would've definitely been made at your wedding.", "NTA. You asked them to stop, they didn't. They are not trustworthy  and they are not your friends if they dont respect your wishes. They seem like the type to try to spoil your wedding.  \nIt's plenty of notice too.", "Where is John in all of this? NTA", "Nta. They would have continued their jokes at the wedding. I had a best friend that I also lived with in my twenties. We worked together and lived together and hung out together so we got many of the same \"they're a couple\" jokes. It gets old quick.", "NTA. Your SIL has no say in your invites. She\u2019s an adult and can still see her friends any time that\u2019s not this specific family function. You clearly made the right choice since these so called friends doubled down on their awfulness by passive aggressively attacking you publicly on social media. Someone who was actually upset they got uninvited would maybe take a hard look at their actions and apologize. These sound like tactless, self centred people. Distancing yourself from them will be good for your happiness and peace of mind.", "NTA - those people are not your friend. And they shouldn't pretend that they are if they continue to tease you after you've asked them not to.", "Ummmm YTA, you invited them because they are your friends.  You kept tally marks and uninvited them to your wedding??  They're being childish and insensitive. You are being equally childish and overly sensitive. If at the end of the night you had let them know what they did, told them you're questioning their friendship. But to uninvite is just too much.", "I wonder if SIL is also embarrassed of herself that OP called out her friends\u2019 bad behavior that she continually accepted", "Plus you KNOW they would've made the same \"jokes\" at OP's wedding.", "The jokes were public so the consequences should be public too.", "NTA\n\nThis is YOUR wedding. YOU and your husband decide who gets invited and who doesn\u2019t. \n\nThis is no longer sex jokes, this is *harassment*.\nThey are your SIL\u2019s friends and she is responsible for keeping them in line.

I wish you a happy day of union!", "My friend (who was more my roommate's friend than mine). For whatever reason it really bothered her that I chose to wait for sex until marriage.  I started out as drunken \"helpfulness\". \"None of us waited and we're fine!\"\n\nK great, but this is my choice. (Also keeping in mind that I didn't even have a boyfriend at the time.)\n\nShe kept escalating, despite me telling her repeatedly that it wasn't funny or any of her business, until it turned into her buying sex toys and hiding them in my room every time. She came over.\n\nRoommate has to start hanging out at the friend's house because I refused to have her around anymore.\n\nWe are no longer friends, obviously.", "You didn't need to warn them in advance. You aren't their parent.\n\nThey showed how much they care about your feelings, and you'd rather not have such people attend your wedding. Simple.\n\nGood for you!!", "Excellent. You've got a keeper! \n\nCongratulations on your upcoming nuptials. I hope you two will be very happy together.", "That\u2019s harassment. I\u2019m sorry you went through that", "Yeah I was completely baffled by this \"joke\" when I read the post, and this explanation hasn't cleared anything up. Maybe it's hilarious amongst the moneyed classes because the only people I know who didn't have housemates in their 20s are those who went straight from living with their parents to living with their partner."]}
