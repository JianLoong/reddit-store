We've been together for 4 years.\n\nBefore I met him (and for the first year and a half of our relationship) I lived with Tammy (27f). Tammy and I have been best friends since we met at 12/13. Tammy and John have a great relationship, too.\n\nThe issue is with some people in my friend group who I met after John and I got serious. For some reason, they're all obsessed with the 'and they were roommates' joke when it comes to Tammy and I. At first it was kind of funny, but now it's crossed a line and they won't stop. If I casually mention Tammy is coming along to an outing, at least 2 people will make some dirty sex joke about the two of us. She hit really hard times during covid, and John and I let her stay in the guest bedroom. Cue the jokes about having a 'maid' wink wink nudge nudge.\n\nIt makes all three of us uncomfortable and I've tried to get them to stop but because they're my (soon to be) SIL's friends (and I am close with SIL- who doesn't make these jokes) it's been hard to cut them out or distance because of the tangled web of connections.\n\nI should note that I have been very clear that I dislike these jokes and that they're being disrespectful to myself, Tammy and John.\n\nWell, last week we all went out and Tammy came along. I was in no mood for these types of jokes and made a note in my phone of everyone who made a joke and how many times they said it. At the end of the night, we all went back to my place and I stood up and pointed at the 'jokesters' and said 'you're uninvited'. Out of the 8 people who went out with us, 4 were uninvited. I made it very clear why and explained it again so there was no confusion. The 4 who were uninvited, left the apartment.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is on my side but my SIL is now fuming. She's super pissed that I've 'isolated' her from her friends because she's 'obligated' to pick family. I said she can still be friends with them so long as they stop the jokes. **(edit; christ alive, people. I'm not dictating her friendships. this was a part of a much bigger conversation that i was obviously not going to transcribe here. she can still be friends with them if they make those jokes but the bigger picture was that I was not going to be friends with them if they continued to make those jokes).** Naturally, the people who I uninvited are pissed too and there has been a barrage of passive-aggressive instagram posts about it and the money they've spent being wasted.\n\nAITA for uninviting them?", "created_utc": 1670284037, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdohrx/aita_for_last_minute_uninviting_multiple_people/", "score": 4512, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Last time I checked, a wedding is about the bride and groom, not the SIL.", "Oh shit me to. Thank you for explaining the real meaning lmao", "What does the **very first line** of my comment say?\n\n>These people are toxic and have no place at your wedding.\n\nSo what the hell are you talking about? I said she should let sexual harassers attend the wedding?\n\nSeriously, what are you talking about?", "Idk why, but I\u2019m reminded of street signs in construction zones in California. When there are speed bumps involved the sign says SLOW BUMP. I saw a slightly different one a couple years ago that said SLOW HUMP. Idk who was in charge of that bit of humor, but it was hilarious.", "NTA! But you are a good friend, you don't need double  tongue snakes at your wedding and in your life .", "what does you uninviting them to your wedding have to do with her being friends with these people. \n\nshe should be talking to these people and demanding an apology for what they said, and you shouldn't go out with you SIL if these people are going to be there. if they come to you and apologize them be the bigger person and accept the apology and re-invite them to the wedding.\n\nif they don't then just cut off contact and make new friends.", "NTA they sound like fools", "NTA\n\nSetting clear boundaries and having them crossed is grounds for removing yourself from people or removing them from you. \n\nYou\u2019re a badass for how you told them. I applaud you and want to be like you.", "Their jokes weren't jokes, they were bullying you. They didn't stop after asking multiple times and knew it made all 3 of you angry. If that anger is funny to them, they are bullies. Could they be jealous? And, why does your SIL feel you are obligated to invite all of HER friends (isolating? Puuuuuullllllleeeeeaaaasssee!) to YOUR wedding? She's not getting married nor is she paying and you get to have fun at your wedding without gross sexual innuendo that was bound to cause issues. If they cared about you, they would stop. NTA", "I see it is kind of a lame joke.  If I was in you situation I think I would have just ignored it rather than deal with the drama but your wedding your choice.  I know I will get down voted for that but just my opinion.  They probably mostly do it because they know it will get a reaction out of you.  Does your fiance agree with uninviting them as well?"]}
