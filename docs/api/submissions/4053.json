We've been together for 4 years.\n\nBefore I met him (and for the first year and a half of our relationship) I lived with Tammy (27f). Tammy and I have been best friends since we met at 12/13. Tammy and John have a great relationship, too.\n\nThe issue is with some people in my friend group who I met after John and I got serious. For some reason, they're all obsessed with the 'and they were roommates' joke when it comes to Tammy and I. At first it was kind of funny, but now it's crossed a line and they won't stop. If I casually mention Tammy is coming along to an outing, at least 2 people will make some dirty sex joke about the two of us. She hit really hard times during covid, and John and I let her stay in the guest bedroom. Cue the jokes about having a 'maid' wink wink nudge nudge.\n\nIt makes all three of us uncomfortable and I've tried to get them to stop but because they're my (soon to be) SIL's friends (and I am close with SIL- who doesn't make these jokes) it's been hard to cut them out or distance because of the tangled web of connections.\n\nI should note that I have been very clear that I dislike these jokes and that they're being disrespectful to myself, Tammy and John.\n\nWell, last week we all went out and Tammy came along. I was in no mood for these types of jokes and made a note in my phone of everyone who made a joke and how many times they said it. At the end of the night, we all went back to my place and I stood up and pointed at the 'jokesters' and said 'you're uninvited'. Out of the 8 people who went out with us, 4 were uninvited. I made it very clear why and explained it again so there was no confusion. The 4 who were uninvited, left the apartment.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is on my side but my SIL is now fuming. She's super pissed that I've 'isolated' her from her friends because she's 'obligated' to pick family. I said she can still be friends with them so long as they stop the jokes. **(edit; christ alive, people. I'm not dictating her friendships. this was a part of a much bigger conversation that i was obviously not going to transcribe here. she can still be friends with them if they make those jokes but the bigger picture was that I was not going to be friends with them if they continued to make those jokes).** Naturally, the people who I uninvited are pissed too and there has been a barrage of passive-aggressive instagram posts about it and the money they've spent being wasted.\n\nAITA for uninviting them?", "created_utc": 1670284037, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdohrx/aita_for_last_minute_uninviting_multiple_people/", "score": 253, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
