It was all being planned by his friends and I was part of the group planning the itinerary. We had zoom calls, meet ups, etc. I had every intention to go and to support my brother. \n\nHis fianc\u00e9 Ella (29F) then planned her bachelorette party. Prior to sending out invitations, Ella called me for advice about her trip. Ella said she knew this will upset my family(my family is very close), but my sister will not be invited as she is going with her friends and not a family trip. I was kind of shocked because my sister was a BRIDESMAID for the wedding\u2026.so how can you not invite her\u2026 \n\nMy mom did pressure Ella to make my sister a bridesmaid because she always wanted to be a one and has no sisters. Honestly, many people dislike my sister so thats why my mom will make sure she\u2019s always included in plans. Ella went on to explain how she regrets allowing my mom to \u201cguilt and bully\u201d her into making my sister a bridesmaid, but she can still make her trip right by inviting her closest friends. I was floored. How incredibly rude to do to the family you\u2019re marrying into? Ella also explained since their wedding is non-traditional, titles, roles, etc did not matter. She kept defending her \u201cright\u201d to invite who she wants to her trip and said she didn\u2019t invite her own sister because they also do not have a close relationship. I still felt like my sister should be going because she has known her for 8 years. Ella even said my sister would RUIN her trip based off past experiences. Which I will admit she has ruined a few nights out with her drinking. But she is FAMILY.\n\nI decide to tell my parents what happened. My mother was devastated and began crying that her daughter wasn\u2019t invited. This into a lengthy fight with my family towards my brother because they wanted to convince him to change Ella\u2019s mind. She was pretty fucking set on her decision. So I dropped out of his trip.\n\nI told Brian I obviously can\u2019t go on his trip since our sister is clearly being left out. If I go and she doesn\u2019t, it would absolutely DEVASTATE my family. I could not have long term resent with my family so I chose to skip it and protect my family. \n\nI am writing now because the bachelor trip was months ago but my relationship with my brother and Ella has not recovered. We used to hang out on weekends but clearly we don\u2019t speak anymore. Ella apparently feels I betrayed her trust by telling my parents about our phone call. She has been distant ever since this happened. I was just doing right by my family. I had no issues with her but did not agree with my sister being left out. \n\nMy family is perfectly fine that I skipped the trip and I was able to support my sister. During the wedding my mom even tried to talk to Ella about this and ask she let everything go, but I don\u2019t know what happened with that. \n\nAnyway. Am I the asshole for defending my family?\n\nEDIT: No one invited to the trip was a bridesmaid. Ella did not want friends to be bridesmaids. She actually ended up sending a text to my sister and her other sister that she wasn\u2019t doing bridesmaids anymore because it was too stressful since she was also dealing with a mental health crisis during the wedding planning", "created_utc": 1669944578, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/za6yga/aita_for_skipping_my_brothers_bachelor_party/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And use your brother to manipulate the situation.\n\nYou're definitely a chip off the old mom block.", "YTA.  The groom is YOUR BROTHER.  The bride is NOT YOUR SISTER and NOT YOUR SISTER'S close personal friend.  That's why you were invited and she wasn't.  It's not an insult, it's just that these parties are for people who are really close and your sister obviously wasn't really close to the bride.\n\nThen you ran to your mommy and told on them!

Your soon to be sister in law got bullied into having your sister as a bridesmaid, which is already off to a bad start.

You admit your sister is known for ruining things.\n\nNo wonder she was having a mental crisis during it all with your family trying to micromanage and control her. Whose wedding even is it? Why should what your sister wants supercede what the bride wants? And instead of arguing reason to your family, you doubled down on the madness and escalated the drama by punishing your brother.\n\nYes, you behaved very badly to both of them and I can understand if they'd want to maintain a distance from you and the rest of your family since you all did everything in your power to ruin *their* time.", "YTA although not the only one.

The fact that your sister is so awful that she couldn't be trusted at a party, and that your mom had to bully someone into including her should indicate the problem.

I guess you're stuck hanging out with your sister.", "YTA\n\nyour sister has a track record of being awful, you mum bullied your future sil into having her in the bridal party and you sister has many people that don't like her due to her behaviour. \n\nIt is about time someone let your sister deal with the consequences of her behaviour.", "YTA\n\nDon\u2019t cause trouble in situations that have nothing to do with you.\n\nI don\u2019t have a problem with Ella\u2019s decision either.

If some how it is, I hope your brother and his wife to be, go no contact and get to live their lives free of pushy bullies that make THEIR wedding, and HER bachelorette party about them.

That at least gives your brother a chance to have a great night.", "This \n\n> I was part of the group planning the itinerary\n\ndoesn't jive with \n\n>During the meeting I was expressing concerns that Brian and his friends would make me go to strip clubs\n\nBut yes YTA you weren't defending your family. There was nothing to defend. Your brother is lucky enough to marry someone who hasn't run screaming into the hills given your family dynamics and the minute she gave a little push back regarding your sister who is a known problem more so when she is drinking, you go running to your mother to tattle and bail on your brother. Funny how your brother stopped being family that is defended when it meant letting someone else make decisions for their event.\n\nIf your family would have been \"devastated\" that you went to your brother's stag party while your sister was left out of the bachelorette party that NONE of the bridesmaids, I think you all need professional help because this is neither normal, natural or healthy.\n\nThem knowing each other for 8 years doesn't make them close. I've known people for decades who I would not call myself close to. We speak when we see each other, but I'd sure af never invite them to my home.", "YTA. Excluding family is not pleasant, but if your sister is KNOWN to ruin family events, WHY would anyone WANT to invite her to a bachelorette party? This is not defending your family, this is FORCING your SILTB to include your sister EVEN THOUGH you know that your sister is likely to ruin the event.", "YTA.  You may want to consider how hypocritical your stance is - family values for when one of your own is at the receiving end of an \u201coffense\u201d, but not when they are the ones committing the offense, like your mother bullying Ella into choosing your sister as a bridesmaid or your sister ruining nights out or just being not nice. I like how you also don\u2019t think that Ella, in fact, does have a right to invite whomever she wants on her nontraditional bachelorette (the entire purpose of which is to be a fun trip to unwind with those closest to her ahead of her wedding).  \n\nWhat\u2019s crazy is that you basically chose your sister over what is right. Because family. You also didn\u2019t seem to think family matters when you ditched your brother for his trip. So stop complaining about Ella and Brian being distant because you made your choice and think it was justified, so should accept the completely natural (and expected) consequences of your actions. \n\nYou guys sound a bit mobbish and I rather feel bad for Ella. Thankfully, it sounds like Brian has her back against the lot of you.\n\nWhy do so many people dislike your sister?", "YTA\n\nI'm a bride planning her bachelorette.  I feel no obligation to include my future sisters in law in the bachelorette invites even though they are in the bridal party.  I am going to invite them because I genuinely want them there, but if I didn't know them well enough or didn't like them, I would feel no obligation to include them.  \n\nA bachelorette party is about the bride being surrounded by a hand-picked group of her closest people.  Just because you extend the polite offer of including your future spouse's family in your bridal party (also not an obligation) does not mean you extend them the intimate offer of the bachelorette.  Especially when you are only including them to appease your future spouse's family.   \n\nYour family is alarmingly rude and entitled, especially your mother. I am guessing your sister is just as rude and entitled, and that's why she has no friends and gets no invites.  Your mom's drama over her daughter not getting an invite was over the top.  And you're TA too about the bachelor party.  It's no wonder your brother and his wife distanced themselves from you.", "\u201cBut she is family\u201d\u2026.omg barf! Fuck that shit.

You used devastated for sis not getting wasted face, what is beyond devastated?\n\n\nYou think having the title of family means your sister gets to be a toxic drunk and make that what your SIL remembers about this weekend?

It was all being planned by his friends and I was part of the group planning the itinerary. We had zoom calls, meet ups, etc. I had every intention to go and to support my brother. \n\nHis fianc\u00e9 Ella (29F) then planned her bachelorette party. Prior to sending out invitations, Ella called me for advice about her trip. Ella said she knew this was upset my family(my family is very close), but my sister will not be invited as she is going with her friends and not a family trip. I was kind of shocked because my sister was a BACHELORETTE for the wedding\u2026.so how can you not invite her\u2026 \n\nMy mom did pressure Ella to make my sister a bachelorette because she always wanted to be a one and has no sisters. Honestly, many people dislike my sister so thats why my mom will make sure she\u2019s always included in plans. Ella went on to explain how she regrets allowing my mom to \u201cguilt and bully\u201d her into making my sister a bachelorette, but she can still make her trip right by inviting her closest friends. I was floored. How incredibly rude to do to the family you\u2019re marrying into? Ella also explained since their wedding is non-traditional, titles, roles, etc did not matter. She kept defending her \u201cright\u201d to invite who she wants to her trip and said she didn\u2019t invite her own sister because they also do not have a close relationship. I still felt like my sister should be going because she has known her for 8 years. Ella even said my sister would RUIN her trip based off past experiences. Which I will admit she has ruined a few nights out with her drinking. But she is FAMILY.\n\nI decide to tell my parents what happened. My mother was devastated and began crying that her daughter wasn\u2019t invited. This into a lengthy fight with my family towards my brother because they wanted to convince him to change Ella\u2019s mind. She was pretty fucking set on her decision. So I dropped out of his trip.\n\nI told Brian I obviously can\u2019t go on his trip since our sister is clearly being left out. If I go and she doesn\u2019t, it would absolutely DEVASTATE my family. I could not have long term resent with my family so I chose to skip it and protect my family. \n\nI am writing now because the bachelor trip was months ago but my relationship with my brother and Ella has not recovered. We used to hang out on weekends but clearly we don\u2019t speak anymore. Ella apparently feels I betrayed her trust by telling my parents about our phone call. She has been distant ever since this happened. I was just doing right by my family. I had no issues with her but did not agree with my sister being left out. \n\nMy family is perfectly fine that I skipped the trip and I was able to support my sister. During the wedding my mom even tried to talk to Ella about this and ask she let everything go, but I don\u2019t know what happened with that. \n\nAnyway. Am I the asshole for defending my family?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's clear why your brother went LC.", "Right. Your truth. \n\nBut you came here to get outsiders opinions, and it\u2019s like 99% YTA (and 99.9% that your mom is even more TA). Rarely are these posts this close to unanimous.\n\nI\u2019m kinda curious though, what will you do with this info? Because now everyone has told you that what you did is assholish behavior, and you still think you did nothing wrong\u2026this has got to be a real conundrum for you!", "Btw stop using the excuse you are doing it for family as your brother is family as well \n\nif you did it for family with then your brother wouldn't have gone LC witch shows that you did it for yourself and the attention of your parents as the golden son", "Clearly that\u2019s working for you.

Also your mom/you is not doing your sister any favors by forcing people to do things with your sister.

Except them.", "Don\u2019t it\u2019s bad advice. If you spent as much time with your brother and Ella as you said then I am sure they vented about the situation to you especially Ella being forced. Having family as a priority is one thing. How we being forced to take your Sister everywhere is strange and weird. Your Mother has created the issues with your sister hy always defending her shit behaviour. No one wants a sloppy drunk that\u2019s going to make a weekend that\u2019s supposed to be fun and about the bride about their future Sister in Law. Your an ass and a terrible brother. Your sister is never going to have any meaningful relationships until she grows up but your family is preventing that from happening enabling her bullshit. No one likes her because she isn\u2019t likeable and you have all prevented her from learning that lesson as instead of having consequences your include her even if your friends don\u2019t like her. Your also going to struggle for that matter because if your attached at the hip to your sister and family comes first over even your girlfriend or then wife good luck keeping them around.

Your choices created an unnecessary high drama situation involving a lot of very unhealthy people who behave pretty terribly by your description.  Some behavior is in fact unacceptable.

They do not manipulate and guilt trip others into catering to their whims, and they do not send their children out into the world with the gross sense of entitlement that you and your sister appear to share.  You may want to work on that.
