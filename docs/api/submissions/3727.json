It was all being planned by his friends and I was part of the group planning the itinerary. We had zoom calls, meet ups, etc. I had every intention to go and to support my brother. \n\nHis fianc\u00e9 Ella (29F) then planned her bachelorette party. Prior to sending out invitations, Ella called me for advice about her trip. Ella said she knew this will upset my family(my family is very close), but my sister will not be invited as she is going with her friends and not a family trip. I was kind of shocked because my sister was a BRIDESMAID for the wedding\u2026.so how can you not invite her\u2026 \n\nMy mom did pressure Ella to make my sister a bridesmaid because she always wanted to be a one and has no sisters. Honestly, many people dislike my sister so thats why my mom will make sure she\u2019s always included in plans. Ella went on to explain how she regrets allowing my mom to \u201cguilt and bully\u201d her into making my sister a bridesmaid, but she can still make her trip right by inviting her closest friends. I was floored. How incredibly rude to do to the family you\u2019re marrying into? Ella also explained since their wedding is non-traditional, titles, roles, etc did not matter. She kept defending her \u201cright\u201d to invite who she wants to her trip and said she didn\u2019t invite her own sister because they also do not have a close relationship. I still felt like my sister should be going because she has known her for 8 years. Ella even said my sister would RUIN her trip based off past experiences. Which I will admit she has ruined a few nights out with her drinking. But she is FAMILY.\n\nI decide to tell my parents what happened. My mother was devastated and began crying that her daughter wasn\u2019t invited. This into a lengthy fight with my family towards my brother because they wanted to convince him to change Ella\u2019s mind. She was pretty fucking set on her decision. So I dropped out of his trip.\n\nI told Brian I obviously can\u2019t go on his trip since our sister is clearly being left out. If I go and she doesn\u2019t, it would absolutely DEVASTATE my family. I could not have long term resent with my family so I chose to skip it and protect my family. \n\nI am writing now because the bachelor trip was months ago but my relationship with my brother and Ella has not recovered. We used to hang out on weekends but clearly we don\u2019t speak anymore. Ella apparently feels I betrayed her trust by telling my parents about our phone call. She has been distant ever since this happened. I was just doing right by my family. I had no issues with her but did not agree with my sister being left out. \n\nMy family is perfectly fine that I skipped the trip and I was able to support my sister. During the wedding my mom even tried to talk to Ella about this and ask she let everything go, but I don\u2019t know what happened with that. \n\nAnyway. Am I the asshole for defending my family?\n\nEDIT: No one invited to the trip was a bridesmaid. Ella did not want friends to be bridesmaids. She actually ended up sending a text to my sister and her other sister that she wasn\u2019t doing bridesmaids anymore because it was too stressful since she was also dealing with a mental health crisis during the wedding planning", "created_utc": 1669944578, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/za6yga/aita_for_skipping_my_brothers_bachelor_party/", "score": 5493, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And use your brother to manipulate the situation.\n\nYou're definitely a chip off the old mom block.", "YTA.  The groom is YOUR BROTHER.  The bride is NOT YOUR SISTER and NOT YOUR SISTER'S close personal friend.  That's why you were invited and she wasn't.  It's not an insult, it's just that these parties are for people who are really close and your sister obviously wasn't really close to the bride.\n\nThen you ran to your mommy and told on them!

YOU, your mom, your sister are all AHs", "YTA\n\nYour family are the in-laws people write horror stories on here about. Your soon to be sister in law got bullied into having your sister as a bridesmaid, which is already off to a bad start.

You admit your sister is known for ruining things.\n\nNo wonder she was having a mental crisis during it all with your family trying to micromanage and control her. Whose wedding even is it? Why should what your sister wants supercede what the bride wants? And instead of arguing reason to your family, you doubled down on the madness and escalated the drama by punishing your brother.\n\nYes, you behaved very badly to both of them and I can understand if they'd want to maintain a distance from you and the rest of your family since you all did everything in your power to ruin *their* time.", "YTA although not the only one.

I guess you're stuck hanging out with your sister.", "YTA\n\nyour sister has a track record of being awful, you mum bullied your future sil into having her in the bridal party and you sister has many people that don't like her due to her behaviour. \n\nIt is about time someone let your sister deal with the consequences of her behaviour.", "YTA\n\nDon\u2019t cause trouble in situations that have nothing to do with you.\n\nI don\u2019t have a problem with Ella\u2019s decision either.

If some how it is, I hope your brother and his wife to be, go no contact and get to live their lives free of pushy bullies that make THEIR wedding, and HER bachelorette party about them.

That at least gives your brother a chance to have a great night.", "This \n\n> I was part of the group planning the itinerary\n\ndoesn't jive with \n\n>During the meeting I was expressing concerns that Brian and his friends would make me go to strip clubs\n\nBut yes YTA you weren't defending your family. There was nothing to defend. Your brother is lucky enough to marry someone who hasn't run screaming into the hills given your family dynamics and the minute she gave a little push back regarding your sister who is a known problem more so when she is drinking, you go running to your mother to tattle and bail on your brother. Funny how your brother stopped being family that is defended when it meant letting someone else make decisions for their event.\n\nIf your family would have been \"devastated\" that you went to your brother's stag party while your sister was left out of the bachelorette party that NONE of the bridesmaids, I think you all need professional help because this is neither normal, natural or healthy.\n\nThem knowing each other for 8 years doesn't make them close. I've known people for decades who I would not call myself close to. We speak when we see each other, but I'd sure af never invite them to my home.", "YTA. Excluding family is not pleasant, but if your sister is KNOWN to ruin family events, WHY would anyone WANT to invite her to a bachelorette party? This is not defending your family, this is FORCING your SILTB to include your sister EVEN THOUGH you know that your sister is likely to ruin the event.", "YTA.  You may want to consider how hypocritical your stance is - family values for when one of your own is at the receiving end of an \u201coffense\u201d, but not when they are the ones committing the offense, like your mother bullying Ella into choosing your sister as a bridesmaid or your sister ruining nights out or just being not nice. I like how you also don\u2019t think that Ella, in fact, does have a right to invite whomever she wants on her nontraditional bachelorette (the entire purpose of which is to be a fun trip to unwind with those closest to her ahead of her wedding).  \n\nWhat\u2019s crazy is that you basically chose your sister over what is right. Because family. You also didn\u2019t seem to think family matters when you ditched your brother for his trip. So stop complaining about Ella and Brian being distant because you made your choice and think it was justified, so should accept the completely natural (and expected) consequences of your actions. \n\nYou guys sound a bit mobbish and I rather feel bad for Ella. Thankfully, it sounds like Brian has her back against the lot of you.\n\nWhy do so many people dislike your sister?", "YTA\n\nI'm a bride planning her bachelorette.  I feel no obligation to include my future sisters in law in the bachelorette invites even though they are in the bridal party.  I am going to invite them because I genuinely want them there, but if I didn't know them well enough or didn't like them, I would feel no obligation to include them.  \n\nA bachelorette party is about the bride being surrounded by a hand-picked group of her closest people.  Just because you extend the polite offer of including your future spouse's family in your bridal party (also not an obligation) does not mean you extend them the intimate offer of the bachelorette.  Especially when you are only including them to appease your future spouse's family.   \n\nYour family is alarmingly rude and entitled, especially your mother. I am guessing your sister is just as rude and entitled, and that's why she has no friends and gets no invites.  Your mom's drama over her daughter not getting an invite was over the top.  And you're TA too about the bachelor party.  It's no wonder your brother and his wife distanced themselves from you.", "\u201cBut she is family\u201d\u2026.omg barf! Fuck that shit.

You used devastated for sis not getting wasted face, what is beyond devastated?\n\n\nYou think having the title of family means your sister gets to be a toxic drunk and make that what your SIL remembers about this weekend?

It was all being planned by his friends and I was part of the group planning the itinerary. We had zoom calls, meet ups, etc. I had every intention to go and to support my brother. \n\nHis fianc\u00e9 Ella (29F) then planned her bachelorette party. Prior to sending out invitations, Ella called me for advice about her trip. Ella said she knew this was upset my family(my family is very close), but my sister will not be invited as she is going with her friends and not a family trip. I was kind of shocked because my sister was a BACHELORETTE for the wedding\u2026.so how can you not invite her\u2026 \n\nMy mom did pressure Ella to make my sister a bachelorette because she always wanted to be a one and has no sisters. Honestly, many people dislike my sister so thats why my mom will make sure she\u2019s always included in plans. Ella went on to explain how she regrets allowing my mom to \u201cguilt and bully\u201d her into making my sister a bachelorette, but she can still make her trip right by inviting her closest friends. I was floored. How incredibly rude to do to the family you\u2019re marrying into? Ella also explained since their wedding is non-traditional, titles, roles, etc did not matter. She kept defending her \u201cright\u201d to invite who she wants to her trip and said she didn\u2019t invite her own sister because they also do not have a close relationship. I still felt like my sister should be going because she has known her for 8 years. Ella even said my sister would RUIN her trip based off past experiences. Which I will admit she has ruined a few nights out with her drinking. But she is FAMILY.\n\nI decide to tell my parents what happened. My mother was devastated and began crying that her daughter wasn\u2019t invited. This into a lengthy fight with my family towards my brother because they wanted to convince him to change Ella\u2019s mind. She was pretty fucking set on her decision. So I dropped out of his trip.\n\nI told Brian I obviously can\u2019t go on his trip since our sister is clearly being left out. If I go and she doesn\u2019t, it would absolutely DEVASTATE my family. I could not have long term resent with my family so I chose to skip it and protect my family. \n\nI am writing now because the bachelor trip was months ago but my relationship with my brother and Ella has not recovered. We used to hang out on weekends but clearly we don\u2019t speak anymore. Ella apparently feels I betrayed her trust by telling my parents about our phone call. She has been distant ever since this happened. I was just doing right by my family. I had no issues with her but did not agree with my sister being left out. \n\nMy family is perfectly fine that I skipped the trip and I was able to support my sister. During the wedding my mom even tried to talk to Ella about this and ask she let everything go, but I don\u2019t know what happened with that. \n\nAnyway. Am I the asshole for defending my family?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your mother stomps alllll over the bride\u2019s boundaries and practically forces her to include your sister (which you admit not many people like), and the bride wants to makes her own choices for the bachelorette and she\u2019s the one in the wrong?!!! Everyone around your sister makes exceptions for her, but no one makes exceptions for the bride?

Why would it matter if you went to your brother's party regardless of your sister's attendance to the bride's party? Are her social & cognitive skills that far off that she would be upset for you going to something? This just baffles me.\n\nAlso the bachelorette party is for the bride..she can choose to invite who she does & doesn't want.

So you probably won't be interested but here are some of my thoughts on your post and comments anyway.\n\n>But if I went my family would of been torn apart. What was I supposed to do? Allow my family to have long term resentment? \n\nDon't you see that this is what's happened anyway. Now you have resentment from Brian and Ella towards the rest of you. I'm sure your sister and mother would've gotten over the lack of an invite to the bachelorette party much quicker than your brother and his wife will get over the dark cloud you all put over their whole wedding. \n\n>During the wedding my mom even tried to talk to Ella about this and ask she let everything go\n\nWTF! So not only did you all cause drama and ruin the excitement in the run up the wedding with this BS, your mom then brought it up at the wedding! What on earth is wrong with her? Knowing that this was a touchy subject already, she couldn't let it go for one day and let her son and his wife enjoy their wedding? And she has the audacity to ask Ella to let it go when none of you let it go when she didn't want your sister as a bridesmaid OR when she wouldn't invite her to the bachelorette. Ella doesn't owe your family a damn thing but you all owe her and Brian a massive apology, although at this stage I doubt it would make any difference. Considering Brian didn't side with any of you it looks like he can see how toxic your family is and is happy to make a new one with Ella. \n\n>My mom did pressure Ella to make my sister a bridesmaid because she always wanted to be a one and has no sisters.\n\nIt sounds like Ella is absolutely right, your mother did bully her into making your sister a bridesmaid and she should be ashamed of herself. What a way to welcome your new daughter-in-law into the family! Ella had every right to decide who she wanted included in her wedding and that includes the bachelorette. If your mom hadn't forced Ella to make her a bridesmaid she wouldn't have felt left out when she wasn't invited to the bachelorette which she only had close friends at.  She didn't even invite her sister who she's known her whole life but you expect her to invite your sister because she's known her for 8 years. I really don't see your logic here.\n\n>Honestly, many people dislike my sister so that's why my mom will make sure she's always included in plans.\n\nThere must be a reason why they dislike your sister and your mom forcing people to include her is just going to build up resentment from everyone else and make your sister even more disliked!\n\nAfter someone asked how old your sister is:\n>25\n\nSHE'S 25! SHE'S AN ADULT! MOMMY SHOULDN'T NEED TO FORCE PEOPLE TO PLAY WITH HER ANYMORE! \n\n>In all honesty my mom still makes her doctor appointments. She does everything for my sister\n\nYour mother still makes her doctor appointments? Your sister needs to grow the hell up!  You all need to quit babying her and teach her to be responsible for her own life, friendships and actions. \n\n>She is a drinker you need to babysit. She is a handful.\n\nThis right here is probably a HUGE part of the reason Ella didn't want her there. It's HER bachelorette party, she doesn't want to have to babysit, she wants to spend time with her friends relaxing and drinking and enjoying herself. It's not her responsibility to babysit a 25 year old woman! And I have no doubt that she would've been held 100% responsible by your family if anything had happened to your sister. \n\n>I figure she could behave for one trip.\n\nWhy the hell would you think that? You said yourself she's ruined other events so why on earth would she all of a sudden be able to control herself and behave like an adult?\n\n>But she is FAMILY.\n\nThis is not a get out clause to act however you want and treat people badly and expect everyone else to just put up with it. What you need to realise is that sometimes families or certain people within them are toxic and don't deserve to be treated special just because they're FAMILY. Sometimes someone needs to stand up to that behaviour and that's what Brian and Ella did. The fact you're defending and participating in this nonsense says a lot about you as a person and trust me, it's not good.\n\n>You think I was being a bully by trying to get her invited to the bachelorette party? I wasn't being mean to them I was trying to calmly and reasonable get her to changer her mind\n\nNo is a complete sentence and a final answer. The fact that you persisted after this is still bullying. Bully's aren't always gruff, overbearing monsters who hit you or get in your face and shout at you. They can be as calm and reasonable as you like and still make your life hell and intimidated you.  Ella gave you her answer and you didn't accept it so you tried to get her to change her mind and didn't like when she refused. You then punished your brother by pulling out of his bachelor party and causing tension during one of the most important times of their lives. All of this is classic bullying tactics.\n\nAll of this could've easily been avoided if you and your mother had just kept your noses out of it and let Ella and Brian organise their wedding they way they wanted it. Your mother shouldn't have forced Ella to make your sister a bridesmaid and you should've kept your mouth shut about the bachelorette because it had nothing whatsoever to do with you. If your sister found out and was hurt well that's up to her to deal with. Every day is a school day and your family have been teaching your sister all the wrong lessons.", "Kudos to Ella and Brian for taking a step back from that crazy family", "Question: Have you apologized at all and give any empathy to Ella for what happened and the amount of pressure your family put on her to do things THEIR way for HER wedding?", ">The groom is YOUR BROTHER.
