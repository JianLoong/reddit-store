But a couple people I've asked IRL have sided with me and I'm still kinda torn on it.\n\nMy in laws live in a hot climate and we go visit regularly. At the end of the day the inside of their house is usually about 80F (26C). I find it nearly impossible to sleep when it's this hot, and there are only so many strategies I can employ to keep cooler. Namely, minimal sleep clothing, not using a blanket, turning on a fan, opening windows once the sun sets. Often when we're visiting I turn the AC on a bit before bed to get it down to maybe 76-78 degrees. I can manage at that temperature. I'm unable to do this when my sister in law is home since she claims she's freezing to death anywhere below 80, so if she's there I just deal with the heat. Important to note here that they showed me the thermostat and invited me to change it if need be.\n\nWhere I live has four seasons so sometimes we are running the heat and sometimes the AC. Shortly after they arrived for a recent visit, I woke up in the middle of the night sweating to find that in order to accommodate my in laws temperature preferences, my wife had turned the heat up to 80F. I turned it back down to 72 and asked them not to change it.\n\nI understand there's an incongruity in me wanting the temperature changed at their house and not wanting it changed at mine, but I feel like being too hot vs too cold comes into play here. Like I said, there's only so many ways you can cool off when it's hot. But if it's cold, put on some socks, grab an extra blanket. Warming up in a 72F home should not be difficult for healthy humans.\n\nI think what it comes down to is AITA for not inviting them to change the temp at my house to whatever they want when they've invited me to do that at their house? And my best defense is my temperature preferences are well within average preferred indoor temps, and it's really easy to warm up but hard to cool down.", "created_utc": 1683134697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136toh2/aita_for_adjusting_the_thermostat_at_my_in_laws/", "score": 1148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Final decision.", "I'm going against the grain and giving you an NAH, but I also probably am biased because like you, I prefer it cooler. However, after admitting that bias, I do think you make a good point about how its easier to warm up by putting on more clothes etc, than it is to cool down. Also, since reddit really only likes to weigh one or two things, I think we have to consider another thing at play here, which is most of us have a sense of what is reasonable and not reasonable. \n\nImagine a scenario where your in-laws say to you, make as much noise as you want at our house, we're very deep sleepers, and they tend to go to bed at 5pm. You decide to watch a movie at 7pm, and its a bit loud. Then, they come to your house, and decide to wake up at 4am and listen to loud music. You would likely tell them they can't do this. What I think gives you a bit of leeway here is (and if anyone replies to my comment I imagine they'll fight me on this) *most* of us agree that it is reasonable to want quiet at 4am, and that it is ok to make noise at 7pm. The temperature issue is similar, most of us want the temperature around 70 degrees in our homes (feel free to google this if you disagree). \n\nAnother related issue on AITA that comes up a lot, which is should hosts have to consider the 'out of regular bounds' dietary restrictions of their guests? Usually the answer is no. If your in laws were raw vegans, and said, please, help yourself to all of our food, and you ate a mango, and then they come to your house and you make a good faith attempt to get them food they can eat, you still have the issue that you can't offer them all of your food, because so much of it they can't eat. And you should be allowed to eat whatever you want in your own home.\n\nSo, I don't think what you're doing here makes you the ah just because its hypocritical as so many have commented.", "YTA \n\nI live in Michigan, but I am naturally a cold person.

Or a heated blanket?  Something similar to the fan option you have as it gets hot - that may be the happy medium or it might not help either way.  But worth offering IMO.\n\nI also noticed your wife changed the temp, the in laws didn\u2019t just get up and assume it was their right.  I know you didn\u2019t imply they did, but I think it\u2019s a key thing here that you didn\u2019t overrule your in laws, you overruled your wife.  In that sense, a very soft, YTA.  You shouldn\u2019t do that to her in general, and you shouldn\u2019t have taken your issue with her to her parents.  You should have addressed your concerns to her and let her then figure out the best option for everyone involved, whether that was her telling them not to touch the thermostat or setting a min/max temp range, or whatever would work for you all.", "If I went to relatives, and they kept it at 80, I would pack up and go to a hotel.

The owner sets the temp in their own house. If he is THAT uncomfortable, he can stay at a hotel. It's not like the in-laws changed the thermostat themselves, the wife did.", "That\u2019s a good rule. I\u2019m going to borrow it.", ">They come to his house and his wife decides to make it 8 degrees warmer? \n\nIs it 'his house' and not the wife's as well?", "As someone with an actual sweating condition where I sweat all the time, even when cold, I promise you it isn't. Being damp all the time may not be painful at face value but I promise you you WILL hurt if your whole body is covered in a thin layer of liquid all day long.", "Op said that he turned the thermostat at his home back down to 72. He was willing to compromise at their home but not at his.", "I wonder if the in-laws are just wearing the same lightweight clothes they would at home, instead of putting on long sleeves.", "My house recently got central air and heat installed and when my temperature is over 74 degrees I start to lose it. I can only tolerate 72 or lower. I also have a ferret and they're heat sensitive so I HAVE to keep it under 72 for her. I am most comfortable at 67-69", "Unless you have undiagnosed hypothyroism, or a heap of other conditions (that often come with age) that affect ones ability to warm up. Hot blooded people think their experience of temperature is universal. It is not.", "Even if she had raised the heat to 74. Okay, ya know, that's too hot for some, too cold for others, there's a debate to be had about that...\n\nNope. *80.*", "I'm not talking about OP's situation. I'm specifically saying it's not innately easier to warm up than cool down.\n\nIt's helpful if you address what I actually said.", "Really depends on how old they are and what temperature they are used to having. My family knows not to visit us in the winter. We only heat the house to 63 in the winter because of the cost of electricity. I would be livid if someone put the temperature up to 80. It is much cheaper to cool a room below 80 in the summer  than it is to heat one to 80.", "At 80 degrees indoors, you can be nude with a fan blowing on you and still feel too warm. I'd rather be uncomfortably cold than uncomfortably hot. My hobby for several months out of the yr is pretty much complaining about how hot the weather is.", "\u2026 and they couldn\u2019t do the same for what reason?", "80 is straight up unacceptable. NTA", "Heat blasting to 80F is very different from natural 80 with a fan.", "My bedroom is normally around 59\u00b0F. Summer time wife and I cannot sleep above 67\u00b0F.", "That\u2019s really hot! 68 is perfect year round. 70 is boiling. Lol.  I\u2019m at 64 now and I like it. And I\u2019m only in Maryland.  Crazy how we are all so different!", "Agreed. I\u2019ve got so many comments here from people who think that 76 is super cold (presumably they don\u2019t own a cardigan) and it\u2019s shocking to me. I\u2019d have to run the heating 24/7 to maintain that kinda heat \ud83d\ude05", "If you can\u2019t put on a jumper and be comfortable at 22 degrees then I don\u2019t know what to say", "Damn. This is my situation. Put me in a situation below 72 and I'm freezing. I keep a kotatsu for warmth. It's impossible to warm up once I get cold and I will be freezing all day. Absolutely miserable.", "I guess I just assumed it would be easier because I get cold easier so I got used to getting warm and it's easier for me, and when it's hot I just die. \n\nBut yeah extremely cold feels 100% like shit as you said I wouldn't recommend that to anyone since one would assume it's easier, 0 stars would not recommend lmao", "They invited him to change it. So he lowered it by a couple degrees. He didn't invite them to change his, but it was raised 8 degrees. There are no double standards here.\n\nFurthermore, it's much easier to keep warm in a \"cold\" environment than it is to keep cool in a warm environment.", "Yes. I hate being either when I'm trying to sleep. It's almost impossible to go to sleep when you are cold unless...hypothermia? All it takes is a little bit of cold to make you uncomfortable. \n\nHeat is kind of different imo. But I can't tap into that discomfort in my head right now because I've been cold the past couple of nights lol so I'm biased. All me in a couple months. For now YTA, but there isn't much you can do about it. \nGet your inlaws some heated blankets", "My experience staying with people who run hot are that they often don't have enough \"warm\" for their guests. They think of what makes them comfortable and buy thin blankets for their guests beds and wonder why their guests complain about how cold they are. As someone who runs cold myself, I often end up looking through linen closets for whatever spare blankets might be around or grabbing my coat or sweater to help me sleep. I've had hosts who run hot look at me and say \"how are you not sweating under that?!\" Like, bro. Not everyone runs hot like you.", "I run cold. Get an electric blanket.", "Exactly. Lack of communication. You don\u2019t turn the heat up THAT much without consulting the other people living there. Do you know how hot it has the be to physically wake you up lol", "You seem to not have much experience with either of these devices, so assuming you\u2019re asking in good faith, a regular fan isn\u2019t going to cool down an 80 degree room very much. It\u2019s just going to move the hot air around, make it a bit more comfortable, but fans don\u2019t actively cool the air the around them very much. You need a whole ass A/C unit for that, and those cost hundreds of dollars and need exhaust through a window. A space heater, on the other hand, costs like $20 and very effectively warms up a room significantly. TL;DR, A fan is not nearly as good at cooling down a hot room as a space heater is at heating up a cold one.", "I agree being too cold sucks. But it's still much easier to warm up at night than cool down. \n\nI'd recommend an electric space heater if they are too cold when visiting.", "For real, I am super temperature sensitive, especially at night. Winters in the Midwest, 70 during the day, 65-68 at night. Summers, 72 during the day, 70 at night. 80 would kill me. I'd get them an electric space heater if they were too cold. It's way easier to warm up than it is to cool down. I seriously get irrationally angry when I'm too hot at night.", "I feel like I run into this one frequently on this subreddit about all kinds of things. Something being normal does not make it morally correct. It doesn't make it morally incorrect either. Sometimes people have fundamentally opposed needs but that doesn't mean somebody has to be wrong.\n\nIf the whole thermostat thing bothers both parties, it is possible that it would be better not to have them stay at one another's houses when visiting. Sometimes there are just people that you can't live with. I think that's okay.", "As a general rule, it is easier for people to warm up than cool down. Individual results may very.", "Okay chill. To your point then, maybe not innately easier, but I'd say practically eaiser. You have more options available to warm up than to cool down.  Like..... A space heater for example.", "I live in texas and rather die before letting it be 80 inside.", "I live in a hot/humid climate and my in-laws keep their house at 78-80. When we visit in the summer I am constantly coated in moisture because their AC can\u2019t dehumidify the house enough at that temp. It\u2019s fucking miserable and I always feel so gross. I don\u2019t know how their house isn\u2019t covered in mold.", "OMG, I grew up without AC at all and I remember days when it would 103 and trying to sleep at night with windows open (we didn't have enough fans for each room). My mom would hang a wet cloth diaper in the windows to try to cool down the breeze, IF there was one. 80 is nothing.", "I live in the desert southwest in the United States, and we had our first 100-degree Fahrenheit day last Sunday. Even before I had my thyroid taken out because of benign tumors, I couldn't sleep if the temperature inside was over 78 degrees. Now, I keep my thermostat set at 68 or 69 degrees in the summer and 64 degrees in the winter. I get very sick when I'm feeling hot.\ud83d\udd25 \ud83e\udd75 \n\nNTA. OP. It's one thing to turn down a thermostat by 2 or 3 degrees at night. It's quite another issue to turn it up 8 degrees.", "Yeah, the hypocrisy is definitely there, and listening to the story as somebody who uses Celsius and not having the immediate frame of reference to what 80 feels like I was like \"ehhh, it is a double standard\" but then I actually read the Celsius conversion. Turning the heat up to 26c overnight? That's insane. Hell, even 22c (the 72 that the sister can't handle) is a completely comfortable daytime temp and I wouldn't ever sleep with my heat on that high. I currently have my heating on because it's daytime and I'm sitting at a desk and it's at the highest I ever have it - 21c. I'll turn it down soon, and I turn the heating off way before bedtime because otherwise it's too warm to sleep. \n\nObviously, these temps feel different depending on whether you're using the heater to heat up a room, or the air con to cool a room, but OP is right, healthy humans should be able to be comfortable at 22c.", "My house is at 74\u00b0 right now with no heat or air on. We are having one of those in between wintery spring days. I\u2019m roasting and am going to have to turn on the air long enough to cool it down for sleep. How do people handle this on a regular basis? Lol", "Except OP did not do this. They offered. Presumably they asked the wife. OPs reaction here makes this YTA. Instead of trying to compromise, he said no changes.", "I do not know how people afford to heat their homes to this degree!

I couldnt have EVER imagined being too hot to sleep comfortably before my partner and I got together.

Just saying that one isnt better than the other. They both suck, they are *both* difficult, and making it seem as if one has it better only serves to excuse that party being miserable while the other gets their way guilt free.", "I have bunions which are when your toes bend inward which was most likely caused by me not having proper fitting shoes growing up \n\nI hardly ever wear socks now and if I do they only make my toes worse technically", "Yeah the problem there is that you have to ask for a space heater", "My mom once refused to put the ACs in when it was 80 degrees and i was sleeping in the living room with her and my sister and my little brother so i couldn't strip.

Your choice is open windows/closed blinds in an effort to circulate some air, or closed windows to keep the heat out and feeling like you\u2019re being smothered by hot still air.
