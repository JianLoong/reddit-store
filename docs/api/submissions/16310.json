But a couple people I've asked IRL have sided with me and I'm still kinda torn on it.\n\nMy in laws live in a hot climate and we go visit regularly. At the end of the day the inside of their house is usually about 80F (26C). I find it nearly impossible to sleep when it's this hot, and there are only so many strategies I can employ to keep cooler. Namely, minimal sleep clothing, not using a blanket, turning on a fan, opening windows once the sun sets. Often when we're visiting I turn the AC on a bit before bed to get it down to maybe 76-78 degrees. I can manage at that temperature. I'm unable to do this when my sister in law is home since she claims she's freezing to death anywhere below 80, so if she's there I just deal with the heat. Important to note here that they showed me the thermostat and invited me to change it if need be.\n\nWhere I live has four seasons so sometimes we are running the heat and sometimes the AC. Shortly after they arrived for a recent visit, I woke up in the middle of the night sweating to find that in order to accommodate my in laws temperature preferences, my wife had turned the heat up to 80F. I turned it back down to 72 and asked them not to change it.\n\nI understand there's an incongruity in me wanting the temperature changed at their house and not wanting it changed at mine, but I feel like being too hot vs too cold comes into play here. Like I said, there's only so many ways you can cool off when it's hot. But if it's cold, put on some socks, grab an extra blanket. Warming up in a 72F home should not be difficult for healthy humans.\n\nI think what it comes down to is AITA for not inviting them to change the temp at my house to whatever they want when they've invited me to do that at their house? And my best defense is my temperature preferences are well within average preferred indoor temps, and it's really easy to warm up but hard to cool down.", "created_utc": 1683134697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136toh2/aita_for_adjusting_the_thermostat_at_my_in_laws/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t think we\u2019re comparing apples to apples here.

It\u2019s their house, not yours. Either both of you adjust when you\u2019re visiting or neither do. As for remaining comfortable I assume the room has windows and it\u2019s cooler than 80 outside? Just close the door and crack a window.", "Yta. Their house, they decide on the temperature.

Not me. My house is a crisp 68\u00b0 in the summer and 67\u00b0 in the winter. When family come over they know it\u2019s my house and my preferred temp.

That\u2019s a double standard, and they probably hate the cold as much as you hate the heat. Find a way to compromise, or suck it up and deal.\n\nYTA. Final decision.", "I'm going against the grain and giving you an NAH, but I also probably am biased because like you, I prefer it cooler. However, after admitting that bias, I do think you make a good point about how its easier to warm up by putting on more clothes etc, than it is to cool down. Also, since reddit really only likes to weigh one or two things, I think we have to consider another thing at play here, which is most of us have a sense of what is reasonable and not reasonable. \n\nImagine a scenario where your in-laws say to you, make as much noise as you want at our house, we're very deep sleepers, and they tend to go to bed at 5pm. You decide to watch a movie at 7pm, and its a bit loud. Then, they come to your house, and decide to wake up at 4am and listen to loud music. You would likely tell them they can't do this. What I think gives you a bit of leeway here is (and if anyone replies to my comment I imagine they'll fight me on this) *most* of us agree that it is reasonable to want quiet at 4am, and that it is ok to make noise at 7pm. The temperature issue is similar, most of us want the temperature around 70 degrees in our homes (feel free to google this if you disagree). \n\nAnother related issue on AITA that comes up a lot, which is should hosts have to consider the 'out of regular bounds' dietary restrictions of their guests? Usually the answer is no. If your in laws were raw vegans, and said, please, help yourself to all of our food, and you ate a mango, and then they come to your house and you make a good faith attempt to get them food they can eat, you still have the issue that you can't offer them all of your food, because so much of it they can't eat. And you should be allowed to eat whatever you want in your own home.\n\nSo, I don't think what you're doing here makes you the ah just because its hypocritical as so many have commented.", "YTA \n\nI live in Michigan, but I am naturally a cold person.

It sounds like at their home, they encouraged you to adjust the temperature to make yourself more comfortable. So, that's perfectly acceptable.\n\nHowever, it sounds like they did speak with your wife first and she gave them permission to change the temperature, as well as assisted in changing the temperature for them, so they didn't actually do anything wrong and your wife was just trying to be polite and accommodating to guests.\n\nGoing forward, you've asked them to not change it but maybe just make sure they have extra blankets available and maybe see about getting a small portable heater for if they really feel uncomfortable and the blankets aren't enough, but otherwise, it sounds like a mountain being made out of a molehill. If they feel that strongly about it, they'll let you know they don't want the thermostat changed the next time you go over is all and as long as you respect that, shouldn't be an issue.", "YTA.

If you want to turn the temp down a bit when you are at their house, then turn it up a bit for them when they are at yours.
