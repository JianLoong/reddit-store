But a couple people I've asked IRL have sided with me and I'm still kinda torn on it.\n\nMy in laws live in a hot climate and we go visit regularly. At the end of the day the inside of their house is usually about 80F (26C). I find it nearly impossible to sleep when it's this hot, and there are only so many strategies I can employ to keep cooler. Namely, minimal sleep clothing, not using a blanket, turning on a fan, opening windows once the sun sets. Often when we're visiting I turn the AC on a bit before bed to get it down to maybe 76-78 degrees. I can manage at that temperature. I'm unable to do this when my sister in law is home since she claims she's freezing to death anywhere below 80, so if she's there I just deal with the heat. Important to note here that they showed me the thermostat and invited me to change it if need be.\n\nWhere I live has four seasons so sometimes we are running the heat and sometimes the AC. Shortly after they arrived for a recent visit, I woke up in the middle of the night sweating to find that in order to accommodate my in laws temperature preferences, my wife had turned the heat up to 80F. I turned it back down to 72 and asked them not to change it.\n\nI understand there's an incongruity in me wanting the temperature changed at their house and not wanting it changed at mine, but I feel like being too hot vs too cold comes into play here. Like I said, there's only so many ways you can cool off when it's hot. But if it's cold, put on some socks, grab an extra blanket. Warming up in a 72F home should not be difficult for healthy humans.\n\nI think what it comes down to is AITA for not inviting them to change the temp at my house to whatever they want when they've invited me to do that at their house? And my best defense is my temperature preferences are well within average preferred indoor temps, and it's really easy to warm up but hard to cool down.", "created_utc": 1683134697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136toh2/aita_for_adjusting_the_thermostat_at_my_in_laws/", "score": 272, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Final decision.", "I'm going against the grain and giving you an NAH, but I also probably am biased because like you, I prefer it cooler. However, after admitting that bias, I do think you make a good point about how its easier to warm up by putting on more clothes etc, than it is to cool down. Also, since reddit really only likes to weigh one or two things, I think we have to consider another thing at play here, which is most of us have a sense of what is reasonable and not reasonable. \n\nImagine a scenario where your in-laws say to you, make as much noise as you want at our house, we're very deep sleepers, and they tend to go to bed at 5pm. You decide to watch a movie at 7pm, and its a bit loud. Then, they come to your house, and decide to wake up at 4am and listen to loud music. You would likely tell them they can't do this. What I think gives you a bit of leeway here is (and if anyone replies to my comment I imagine they'll fight me on this) *most* of us agree that it is reasonable to want quiet at 4am, and that it is ok to make noise at 7pm. The temperature issue is similar, most of us want the temperature around 70 degrees in our homes (feel free to google this if you disagree). \n\nAnother related issue on AITA that comes up a lot, which is should hosts have to consider the 'out of regular bounds' dietary restrictions of their guests? Usually the answer is no. If your in laws were raw vegans, and said, please, help yourself to all of our food, and you ate a mango, and then they come to your house and you make a good faith attempt to get them food they can eat, you still have the issue that you can't offer them all of your food, because so much of it they can't eat. And you should be allowed to eat whatever you want in your own home.\n\nSo, I don't think what you're doing here makes you the ah just because its hypocritical as so many have commented.", "YTA \n\nI live in Michigan, but I am naturally a cold person.

Or a heated blanket?  Something similar to the fan option you have as it gets hot - that may be the happy medium or it might not help either way.  But worth offering IMO.\n\nI also noticed your wife changed the temp, the in laws didn\u2019t just get up and assume it was their right.  I know you didn\u2019t imply they did, but I think it\u2019s a key thing here that you didn\u2019t overrule your in laws, you overruled your wife.  In that sense, a very soft, YTA.  You shouldn\u2019t do that to her in general, and you shouldn\u2019t have taken your issue with her to her parents.  You should have addressed your concerns to her and let her then figure out the best option for everyone involved, whether that was her telling them not to touch the thermostat or setting a min/max temp range, or whatever would work for you all.", "If I went to relatives, and they kept it at 80, I would pack up and go to a hotel. There is no way I could sleep at that temp. I put mine at 70  for sleeping. If my wife wouldn't complain so much, I would do 65. If they came to my house and set it at 80.....", "They didn't turn it up though, his wife did! And I agree, she should have set it at the compromise point.", "Even a 2-degree temperature change is huge to some people. For me, it would definitely be significant. \"What is the difference between 8 and 2?\" A lot to some people!  \n\nThe fact is, everyone has their own internal temperature.  Everyone has their own set idea of what a comfortable level of heat and coolness is like.  It can drive couples insane, as I also like it very cold while my partner likes things warm and toasty.\n\nMy dad is in the Philippines and it is 111 degrees there. This is normal for them.  Not normal for my dad, to be sure.  I live in Canada, where we joke about having 4 seasons, but we have only 3: It gets too freaking hot, freezing as eff , or so-so.  \n\nBut you become the AH when it is only your internal temperature that matters. So only your comfort matters, anyone else...\"Fogit abawt it\".", "Agreed. It's a huge difference in temperature (2-3' vs 8-9) AND it's much easier to stay warm at 72' than it is to stay cool at 80'.  \n\n\nAlso, the solution seems obvious, get them a space heater and they can make that room 100' if they want.", "Why does he mind the small change? If it's reasonable at his temp, 2-4 degrees are also reasonable too, right? If not, then it's not that small a change. Also, people from warmer climates adjust slower/more difficultly to cold.

I HATE it being so warm in my apartment, but yeah, usually sits at 80 cause I'm not trying to have a billion dollar power bill.

You are basing it of your own biases.", "72 is reasonable to most of us. But not everyone. Apparently it is not for them. Everyone should be able to have their own home their preferred temperature.

I live in the tropics and 80 is the perfect temperature. I'll even grab a light blanket in case I wake up a little cold. I don't even turn on my ceiling fan until we are getting above 90 temperatures. The idea that anyone would choose to sleep in 72F instead of 80F is kind of crazy to me.", "Hotels aren't always an option", "Man if I visited your house I\u2019d show up with gloves, a blanket, and an extra sweater!\n\nMy husband prefers it cooler (ideally about 65) and I prefer it warmer (ideally 72-74). We compromise at 68-70 and neither of us is comfortable. I spend my time covered in couch blankets wearing fuzzy socks while he walks around in nothing but shorts. It is downright BLISSFUL when I visit friends and family and get to be comfortable!\n\nAnd I still say OP is NTA.

That's...not what's happening here.", "My gf and I both ask eachother before changing the temp. You and OPs wife having shitty communication skills isn\u2019t an excuse. Literally nothing indicates he was pissed lol. You\u2019re projecting that onto him. It literally says he asked them not to change it. So you point is moot cause you don\u2019t even know if he did say please or not lmao.", "I don\u2019t think anyone is saying it\u2019s pleasant being too cold, just that the options to try and warm yourself up are not only multitudes greater than cooling yourself off but also generally more specific to you. \n\nYou can put on jackets socks etc and it only affects you. You can\u2019t just take off your clothes and have it only affect you in most situations.", "Yeah, I always hate the \"you can put more clothes on.\" I have Reynauds and anemia, and being too cold fucking hurts my body. I worked in an office where the summer temp was kept at a crisp 62. Even with stockings, long pants, long sleeves, a blazer, and a coat, I would be in pain by the end of the day. I had to end up getting a note from my doctor, so I could have a space heater.", "Yeah, but let's admit that being extremly hot is harder to deal with since you have limited options, unlike coldness for which you can put a lot of blankets on for, sure it's not comfortable but you can't remove \"infinite\" clothes when it's hot. \n\n(also it wasn't freezing it was just a bit cold, but 80 degrees is *a lot* (at least for me, im weak lmao)", "Omg, thank you! I feel like people don't get this. There is a point where adding clothes only makes you more uncomfortable. And there are times when the clothes don't suffice, like if you are trying to work with cold hands. But also, if you're trying to sleep and your neck gets cold. You can't really wear anything for that, and if you're not someone who is comfortable covering up their face with the blanket, then you are kind of screwed. \n\nI feel like the other side doesn't understand how bad it can be for people who run cold so we are always told to deal with it, as though we are lying about how bad it really is.", "I\u2019ve gotten hypothermia before. I\u2019ve been so cold it felt like someone was jamming railroad spikes into my flesh as a warmed back up. It *hurt*. But there are things you can do. Like tuck hand warmers into the backs of your gloves. Or get a heated blanket. You can move around to warm yourself up. When you are too warm there are extremely limited things you can do. You can get naked. You can eat cold things. But after that the fixes get harder and harder. You can tuck ice packs into your clothes or lay on top of ice packs but that only lasts as long as the ice pack takes to melt. You can go make like a lizard and sit in tepid water to let that cool you, but that requires being in the tub constantly. The options are *much* more limited.", "Exactly. I used to work with a guy who would keep the AC going year round at 62 degrees. This might be fine if we were living in like Hawaii or something, but we\u2019re in Nova Scotia and it gets COLD here.
