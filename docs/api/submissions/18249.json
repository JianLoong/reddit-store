You were drunk and you\u2019d been pestered about this for so long that your reaction makes sense. I think it would\u2019ve been better to end this before it got to this point; either by saying \u201cPlease stop asking me this question, it\u2019s making me uncomfortable,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve already given you an answer, I am done discussing it,\u201d or \u201cIf you think I\u2019m a liar, then why are you friends with me?\u201d or something along those lines.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH because she literally asked for this. I\u2019m sure there are people who will find her pretty, so she should seek reassurance from them instead of trying to force it out of you (and still being dissatisfied when you told her she was pretty). I think from now on, you should work on shutting these conversations down completely before they get to a point of trapping you. Instead of changing the subject, be blunt and make it clear that you won\u2019t discuss it.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA because you were kind of put in an impossible situation. \n\nWhen you change the subject, she still asks and does not get the hint that you don\u2019t want to talk about it\n\nWhen you say she isn\u2019t she does not believe you and keeps asking\n\nWhen you tell the truth, she gets upset.\n\nI don\u2019t believe there is anything you really could have said or done that would have pleased her or that she would accept.

Your friend for pestering you so much about this over and over and over, and you for not dealing with it directly in the first place.  You should have had a response that you pulled out every time \"I don't talk about looks.  Stop asking me.\" and pulled that out every. single. time.", "ESH. She must seek professional counseling if her self-esteem issues are as bad as they sound. Pestering her friends for reaffirmation isn't helping her. Unless she's that socially unaware, she knows she's annoying you but does it anyway because her need for validation triumphs over her respect for others' boundaries. \n\nThat said, drunk or sober, you didn't need to shatter her already inexistent confidence by calling her ugly. A simple \"I do not want to answer that question ever again, so stop asking me\" would've sufficed. Repeating this phrase every time she asked, or simply ignoring her question from then on, would've worked. You are justified in being fed up with her pestering. You are not justified in being mean to her as retaliation.", ">The thing is she hasn\u2019t spoken to me since\n\nI'd keep it that way, tbh. She sounds exhausting and wasn't getting the hint.
