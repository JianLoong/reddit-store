She booked the day off so you could spend a family day together, but you turned round and said \"OK then - I'll go visit elder daughter\".\n\nShe wants to spend time with you. Do you not want to spend time with her?", "Info - why can't you take your 1yo with you when you go to see your 10yo?", "Definitely YTA. \n\n1. Your wife booked this weekend off specifically to spend with the three of you, not so that she could be stuck home with the baby while you travel to see your other daughter. \n\n2.  You need to work on getting your daughter more than once a month. Get her for the summer or something.", "YTA.  Your GF has 3 weekends off a year, and you're going to take off on one of them?  I'd be pissed at you, too.", "Why doesn't your daughter come and stay with ya'll?  AND, if you aren't working on the weekends, why aren't you taking your 1 year old with you to see your 10 year old?\n\nSounds like the /fiancee is doing all the working and the heavy lifting on raising your baby.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nIs she your partner or your babysitter?

She is a saint and you are Residue.", "Why wouldn\u2019t you all go see your daughter??\n\nEdit I see you answered you all cannot afford it. \n\nEsh I feel bad for your daughter. She\u2019s clearly not considered family.", "ESH and I think you need a serious conversation with your fianc\u00e9e about how she sees the future unfolding.\n\nAs it is, you honestly don't spend enough time with your eldest daughter. Sorry, but it's true. One visit per month doesn't make a good relationship with a kid you chose to bring into the world.\n\nYour older daughter is family and her presence should be scheduled into your plans and activities. If your gf has three weekends off a year and it is deemed 'family time', all the members of the family need to be there. Presumably, she knew that you were a man with a child when she chose to get into a relationship with you. There are responsibilities that come along with dating and marrying someone with existing children. One of them is knowing that all the children need to be included and considered.", "YTA a massive one at that because you knew her intention was to have family time, and said screw you Im going to see my oldest. I completely understand wanting to see your oldest as much as possible but at the expense of your relationship with your family shows you have no sense of balance and the fact your shocked she\u2019s off with you after you ditched her acknowledging you rarely spend time together as a family these days. She even used one of her three weekends for your daughters visit so you\u2019re just trying to have your cake and eat it to.", "YTA", "YTA.

Can't you compromise by doing something all together (you, fiance, older + younger kid)? Maybe you could invite her to go with you too? If she's still against that then she's the AH.", "Nta. I\u2019m never going to say it\u2019s a bad thing to want to see the child you rarely see. Your child\u2019s feelings and being able to see you is frankly more important than your fianc\u00e9\u2019s feelings. She\u2019s not wrong to be upset, but she picked a guy to gave a kid with who also already has a kid who needs him and gets almost nothing.", "Honestly, this comes down to you and fiance need to have some serious conversations because yeah, you visiting your eldest needs to be a priority. Not just for you but it should also be a priority for her. But family time is also important.\n\nIt sounds like your daughter lives pretty far from you and presumably you living closer isn't a viable option. Presumably, your daughter is also with you at holidays at such. But that isn't the same as you being in her life on a daily basis. (Something your child with her is hopefully going to experience.) So you being there as frequently as possible is important.\n\nThat doesn't mean the you, fiance and your child spending time together isn't important. But right now it may not be as important.\n\nNTA but it feels like there should be been some serious talks before the 2 of you had a kid together...", "NTA.  Your fianc\u00e9e doesn\u2019t consider your 10 year old part of the family.  I\u2019d put that wedding on hold until you do some pre-marital counseling with her so you both understand what effect that is going to have on your child.", "INFO: What sort of sweatshop nightmare job does your fiancee have that she only gets three weekends off a year?", "Of course NTA.", "NTA, but you do know when a woman tells you to go ahead and do something, that always means DON'T, right? Just a heads up...", "NAH.  So it sounds like from comments I see you go down early in the morning and come back late at night when you go visit your older daughter, and it\u2019s not feasible for everyone to go\u2026 Presuming everyone understands and accepts that, I can understand your fianc\u00e9 thinking one of the few weekends she gets off you\u2019re gonna be gone, but it will only be one day.  So you can have family time the other day, but she needs to understand your other daughter is important as well. That can be a mommy and me day for her and your one year old while you\u2019re gone. She should be able to see the value in that, but I understand her wanting to have you for a whole weekend.  But it is nice that you don\u2019t have to try to figure out logistics of who\u2019s going to take care of the one year-old on a day you\u2019re going to visit\u2026 I totally see both sides\u2026 \n\nIt\u2019s definitely OK and normal for her to be disappointed, but if she\u2019s getting pissy and angry then she falls into asshole territory", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
