{"id": 18071, "submission_id": "13qn3gg", "title": "AITA for yelling at her to stop causing a scene?", "selftext": "My fiance\u00e9 \"Hannah\" (29f), myself (28m) and our 3 kids booked a vacation months ago to come visit my family in Maine this week. We were originally supposed to stay at a hotel but when we got here we were told that they overbooked and essentially every other hotel was full so we ended up needing to room up at my sister's house. This is incredibly stressful, given how my sister is, but I obviously have a higher tolerance because it's my sister and I was raised by her in this home. \n\nNow.. my sister is the type who will run her mouth about T.rump, completely unwarranted. She brings up events as much as possible, or just other drama in general (she is an extremist). She also has 3 dogs who run the house and are completely untrained. As in begging for food at your feet, whining nonstop, jumping on top of you if you are sitting on the couch, etc. As I said, it's a very stressful environment but again, I have a higher tolerance. My only goal right now is to keep my fiance\u00e9 comfortable and calm because she gets pissed off incredibly easy when it comes to untrained dogs AND media drama. Unfortunately staying with my sister was literally our only option. \n\nSo we have been here for 2 nights now and Hannah is already completely done. This was supposed to be a 2 week trip. She's becoming snappy and the entire family is picking up on it and asking what's wrong and making snid comments to me about her attitude. Like Hannah has been snapping at the dogs to get away from her and the kids or has been passive aggressively putting her headphones in whenever my sister starts bringing up basically anything. And while I understand, it's also putting me in a bad spot. The final straw was this morning. She was sitting on the couch with a coffee and one of the dogs jumped up on her and spilled her coffee. She snapped \"Get the fuck away from me\" and then got up and stormed out of the house to go sit in the car with her headphones. She came in an hour later and stood hovering over our youngest son and continuously slammed the dog out of the way whenever she started begging at our sons feet. So I kind of hissed at her to stop causing a fucking scene because the whole family is just beside themselves at this point and we are all walking on eggshells. She goes \"A scene? A fucking scene? Seriously? I have been trampled, jumped on, had boiling hot coffee spilled on me and food is being ripped from our kids hands, all while being cornered by drama every fucking time I breathe. Calm your fucking family down.\" She left and the family is pissed at both me and her. Her for causing a fight and me for not \"voicing why she was so pissed\".\n\nETA: there's other stuff too.. like the dogs have been taking the blankets off the kids at night and curling up with the blankets on the floor and it's cold here. Or my sister keeps recruiting her and I to do chores around the house because Hannah is able and my sister is not (she is obese and can't move around too much without being extremely winded). So there's more to it but the most of it is the dogs and extremist drama.\n\nHannah DID voice that she doesn't want to hear the drama because it pisses her off. She was very blunt with my family about it. When she told them this however, they pulled the whole \"so you're offended by the truth\" comments (as I said- my sister is an extremist and if you don't agree with her, you must be an idiot). She's also said she didn't want the dogs near her or the kids while they are eating. We were told it's \"their house\". So Hannah was 100% vocal. She didn't turn in to an ass until her requests were ignored.", "created_utc": 1684938046, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qn3gg/aita_for_yelling_at_her_to_stop_causing_a_scene/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
