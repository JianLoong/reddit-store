{"id": 18071, "submission_id": "13qn3gg", "title": "AITA for yelling at her to stop causing a scene?", "selftext": "My fiance\u00e9 \"Hannah\" (29f), myself (28m) and our 3 kids booked a vacation months ago to come visit my family in Maine this week. We were originally supposed to stay at a hotel but when we got here we were told that they overbooked and essentially every other hotel was full so we ended up needing to room up at my sister's house. This is incredibly stressful, given how my sister is, but I obviously have a higher tolerance because it's my sister and I was raised by her in this home. \n\nNow.. my sister is the type who will run her mouth about T.rump, completely unwarranted. She brings up events as much as possible, or just other drama in general (she is an extremist). She also has 3 dogs who run the house and are completely untrained. As in begging for food at your feet, whining nonstop, jumping on top of you if you are sitting on the couch, etc. As I said, it's a very stressful environment but again, I have a higher tolerance. My only goal right now is to keep my fiance\u00e9 comfortable and calm because she gets pissed off incredibly easy when it comes to untrained dogs AND media drama. Unfortunately staying with my sister was literally our only option. \n\nSo we have been here for 2 nights now and Hannah is already completely done. This was supposed to be a 2 week trip. She's becoming snappy and the entire family is picking up on it and asking what's wrong and making snid comments to me about her attitude. Like Hannah has been snapping at the dogs to get away from her and the kids or has been passive aggressively putting her headphones in whenever my sister starts bringing up basically anything. And while I understand, it's also putting me in a bad spot. The final straw was this morning. She was sitting on the couch with a coffee and one of the dogs jumped up on her and spilled her coffee. She snapped \"Get the fuck away from me\" and then got up and stormed out of the house to go sit in the car with her headphones. She came in an hour later and stood hovering over our youngest son and continuously slammed the dog out of the way whenever she started begging at our sons feet. So I kind of hissed at her to stop causing a fucking scene because the whole family is just beside themselves at this point and we are all walking on eggshells. She goes \"A scene? A fucking scene? Seriously? I have been trampled, jumped on, had boiling hot coffee spilled on me and food is being ripped from our kids hands, all while being cornered by drama every fucking time I breathe. Calm your fucking family down.\" She left and the family is pissed at both me and her. Her for causing a fight and me for not \"voicing why she was so pissed\".\n\nETA: there's other stuff too.. like the dogs have been taking the blankets off the kids at night and curling up with the blankets on the floor and it's cold here. Or my sister keeps recruiting her and I to do chores around the house because Hannah is able and my sister is not (she is obese and can't move around too much without being extremely winded). So there's more to it but the most of it is the dogs and extremist drama.\n\nHannah DID voice that she doesn't want to hear the drama because it pisses her off. She was very blunt with my family about it. When she told them this however, they pulled the whole \"so you're offended by the truth\" comments (as I said- my sister is an extremist and if you don't agree with her, you must be an idiot). She's also said she didn't want the dogs near her or the kids while they are eating. We were told it's \"their house\". So Hannah was 100% vocal. She didn't turn in to an ass until her requests were ignored.", "created_utc": 1684938046, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qn3gg/aita_for_yelling_at_her_to_stop_causing_a_scene/", "score": 572, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have absolutely no idea why anyone involved thought this was a smart plan, but it\u2019s his family\u2019s home and his wife is a guest and instead of just leaving she\u2019s physically and verbally lashing out. That\u2019s not the way, either. ESH except the children.", "Why am I not surprised that someone is defending the woman in this case and her rudeness to the family\u2019s hospitality (which btw, livable or not, they extended space for his fianc\u00e9 and they are the way they are. They don\u2019t HAVE to allow them a free space for two weeks even if it is unpleasant.) and not considering the rock and hard place that he\u2019s in. But because he\u2019s the man, he\u2019s the bad guy, right? I\u2019m curious, did you have a father in the home growing up? And if so, was he head of the household or did you grow up witnessing mama force him to submit to HER?", "No, I want to know why you won't drive elsewhere, too. It takes *four and a half hours* to drive across Maine. That is nothing to the 26 hour drive you already made.\n\nAnd this is assuming literally *all* accommodations are booked solid until the state border, which is unrealistic at best.\n\nNah, you're being a coward and won't stand up for your own family. How pathetic.", "Please tell me you\u2019re not a dog owner because your comment on how the sister allows her dogs to act just screams that you share in her gross negligence.", "I stopped paying attention about him somewhere around February after he was out of office. If he goes to jail, I'll believe it when I see it.", "Even if they were just being nipped at, having dogs that haven't been taught any boundaries around food and behavior isn't okay and I'd certainly never expect my kids to be somewhere where this was an ongoing issue and the dog owner wasn't doing anything to stop them.", "You\u2019re an immense embarrassment as a man, partner and father. Also, based on your post and comments, sounds like you\u2019re not only (a huge) TA - but also a trump sympathizer. Over 300 people and counting telling you to get your family to safety and that YTA. Every comment you write is so defensive and full of malarkey, that it amazes me you even thought it was a good idea to write it out.", "Why are you letting your children be bit, have food stolen from them, and have their blankets ripped off of them at night? How are you protecting your family?", "Yeah I hear ya. Now that I realize how the dogs are treating the kids, I can say that I would do the same thing as well", "I mean, fair. I think because she's a guest, they should be trying to make her more comfortable? Be hospitable and accommodating? If someone stays in my home, I try to make them comfortable. I don't talk politics, especially if I know they don't agree. I don't let my dogs run amok (I don't let them anyway, but if I know my dog struggles with a behavior, I try to mitigate its impact). \n\nThe effort should be on both sides, but honestly, if food is being ripped out of my kids' hands and their safety is at risk (per ops comments), I'd definitely cause a scene. I also would have set the boundary and then left once it was crossed because I'm not playing with dogs who are aggressively taking food out of mine and my kids' hands and/or mouths. I think ESH, too, but more because this situation is not out of OP, his wife, or his sisters hands. OP or his wife could have pulled the plug. His sister could attempt to be accommodating to guests in her home...especially with dogs who are posing a safety risk to her guests. \n\nI would have left the situation with or without my husband. Maine has a ton of parks. Hotels may be booked, but they could have rented an RV if they really wanted to stay. They could have taken their asses back home too. \n\nOPs sister should have accommodated her guests, regardless of the reasoning why. Because she didn't, it makes her the asshole. \n\nOP and his wife (either together or independently) could have decided to leave if boundaries were crossed. They didn't, that makes them assholes. \n\nKids are stuck doing whatever their parents decide.", "I think it's Ops fault because it's his family. He knows his fiance and sister don't get along and went in knowing it would be \"stressful\" but it was fine for him because he has a higher tolerance, having grown up there. Reread the first paragraph,  he doesn't put his fiance's thoughts at all,  probably because she would've rather gone home.", "Bro what the fuck are you even on right now? In other comments, I have clearly said I think OPs wife is also TA for not removing herself and her kids from that environment. \n\nI blame OP because he knew how it would be. He knew how it would go. It is his family. He knew his wife would struggle in the environment and still stayed. I'm sure OPs wife has tried to stay because it is her husband's family. \n\nI had both parents, and while shit wasn't perfect, my mom was a sahm, and my dad worked. My parents typically made decisions together. There was no submission on either side. They were equals. My own marriage is a team effort, and our household is less traditional in the sense that we both divide the household chores and child-rearing equally. We both work. So, whatever point you are trying to make is bullshit. \n\nIf you invite guests into your home, you try to accommodate their needs. If you cant accommodate those needs then you say no. It's pretty simple.", "The sister is living in her own home. OP and his family invited themselves to stay for TWO WHOLE WEEKS when they knew about the dogs and knew she was a bore anout politics. I don't care is Sis is raising jackals in the bathroom. OP and his family need to go someplace else.\n\nNice effort at derailment, though!", "Well *get ready* to see it all again. I\u2019ve already started seeing trump campaigns for the primary.", "Thank you for saying this! No one wants to hear rants about the same topic all day long, whether it\u2019s politics, sports, religion, or whatnot. A former friend of mine used to complain nonstop about how horrible her ex husband was \u2026. Guess what? Everyone stopped wanting to hang out with her because they got tired of hearing about it, me included. An extremist on any topic is annoying. I\u2019d be just as irritated in OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9e\u2019s position, regardless my personal beliefs or politics.", "Yeah I don\u2019t like Trump either but if someone started talking about how much they dislike him every 10 minutes that would drive me mad. \n\nSounds like OP\u2019s sister could do with going outside every once in a while", "Why are we all taking him at his word that she is actually an \u201cextremist\u201d though? He used that word like 10 times, that and drama. There were no actual examples or specifics. He\u2019s shown he\u2019s YTA for the rest of his actions, I\u2019m just not really even sure I believe the extent of those claims. It sounds like every story from subs like entitledparents or the old fatpeoplehate sub. Where everything is one note and excessive. Just my thoughts on this.", "I wasn\u2019t talking to you so I\u2019m\nNot going to reason or explain myself to you. I\u2019m talking to the other person who feels so strongly about OP and his family", "I\u2019m not reading all that \ud83e\udd10\n\nI\u2019m not actively going to look for the \u201cother comments\u201d at all, I\u2019m not thinking about you really. I just commented on something I seen because your comment originally was putting all the blame on him until I jabbed", "Agreed.  So many people have zero manners or consideration these days, with excuses like \"it's the dog's house\" or \"my kids can do what they want in their own house\".  While this is technically true, it's extremely selfish and bad manners to expect guests to tolerate it.  If you don't mind out of control pets or kids when you are alone, that's fine, you do you. But when you have visitors you need to raise your standards to a level that doesn't endanger or greatly inconvenience them.  Because civilization.", "It appears they were.  That the point of the trip was to visit the sister, who raised OP, in the home they are visiting. While they were not originally invited to stay in the house, they were invited to visit.", "Do you think that OP and his fam just\u2026 broke in? Like seriously? They wouldn\u2019t be there without sister agreeing to that. I own a dog. My dog is fucking trained and has manners because dogs NEED to be trained. Would it be fucking okay for a person to go around snatching food out of their guests hands and scratching or biting them JUST because \u201cit\u2019s my house and this is what I always do\u201d? Fucking no! Just because it\u2019s their house doesn\u2019t make the behaviors acceptable.", "Generally, but they are not guests in this case. If you never invite anyone to your house, you don't have to train your dogs to be around other people. This is a family of four that showed up unexpectedly and said \"host us for 2 weeks.\" And when asked to help out around the house, he said he couldn't because it would be enabling his fat sister. And even though everyone was obviously miserable, they didn't make new vacation plans and leave the next day. The first night may have been an emergency after having been turned away from the hotel, everything beyond that is an imposition.", "It definitely sounds like they imposed themselves on Sis. And they need to leave.", "They are guests if she agreed to host them. They aren't there without her permission. If you're going to agree to let people you care about stay, do it right and practice some level of hospitality. Don't be an uncivilized slob and say, \"well you can leave if you want, bro\"\n\nBut agreed on becoming an imposition at a certain point.", "Her dogs bit the children. EVERYONE would say that\u2019s wrong."]}
