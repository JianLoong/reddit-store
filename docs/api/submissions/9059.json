Nick said he had never heard of any of them, which I thought was crazy\n\nThis morning MIL called us at 9am(we were still in bed) asking if we would be offended if she continued to buy our baby girl clothes and stuff when she shops. MIL tends to overthink and has a lot of anxiety in general(diagnosed) and was asking because she sent me a picture of a sweater she bought(which not that it matters but it was a 6-9month boys sweater light blue with trucks on it. We\u2019ll still have our daughter wear it) I had responded by saying \u201cthat is cute! I\u2019m excited for all the baby clothes look what I bought\u201d and showing her an outfit that I just purchased. She got anxious that since I didn\u2019t say anything else about the sweater that I wasn\u2019t okay with her buying things or had an issue with that sweater in particular. That\u2019s why she called. We reassured her she\u2019s good. She told me to keep buying the cute girly outfits and she\u2019ll buy the outdoor play outfits\n\nNick brought up how we made a registry and she asked me to send it to her mentioning that FIL might help with some big things and she\u2019s excited about the small things. That\u2019s when I mentioned the books. I told her that I put all the classic childhood books on there and was surprised that Nick didn\u2019t know any of them and that we\u2019re definitely going to buy them\n\nMIL instantly got offended saying not to believe \u201cNicks crap about how he didn\u2019t have a good childhood\u201d because of course she read him books but they played outside more and how I can ask anyone in the family and they\u2019ll confirm that she was the best mom. She went on for a few minutes and in my opinion there were plenty of moments where she gave Nick an opening to just say yeah I did have a good childhood, and the whole thing would have ended right there. I was quiet and he didn\u2019t say a thing and she hung up sounding like she was crying. As soon as she hung up I texted her saying Nick and I realize the only reason I remember the books is that I have more siblings so the books were in my house for close to 15 years whereas he\u2019s an only child \n\nShe sent Nick a text asking if he really thinks he had a bad childhood and how she did her best. Nick got mad at me saying I never should have brought it up and look what I\u2019ve done. How I turned him into the bad guy just because he told the truth. I feel like he could\u2019ve stopped it by just saying \u201cno I don\u2019t think I had a bad childhood\u201d at any point but he thinks it\u2019s my fault knowing how his mom gets anxious.

Nick could've stopped it or, if he didn't have a good childhood, well, good on him for not being manipulated into saying he did! But it's not your fault.\n\nHonestly, the fact that he DIDN'T pipe up to reassure her suggests to me there's some real baggage there and I would be pretty cautious about bringing up anything related to Nick's childhood ever, at all with her. Especially if Nick is around. You don't want him in a position where he has to decide if he should lie to take care of her emotions or be honest/quiet and deal with her escalating.", "NTA - she sounds exhausting. Why didn't he speak up while she was on her tirade? Or is he just tired of constantly having to reassure just as well? Whatever the case, your comment wasn't malicious and her reaction was overboard.", "NTA. Talk about deflection. Your husband failed to make any comment, his mother reacts, but it\u2019s your fault.\n\nIf your husband is really concerned, he can call his mom and help soothe her anxiety.", "NTA, and yikes, if your MIL turned a passing comment about books into him complaining about a terrible childhood and husband then getting mad at you. All the luck in the world, OP you\u2019re going to need it.", "NTA, but clearly,  Nick did not have a magnificent childhood.  It is not his job to tell her she was a great mom, I am sure her anxiety got in the way since he was not defending her immediately.  However,  maybe don't mention these \"failings\" as it clearly puts him in a tough spot and makes your MIL frankly super annoying and emotionally draining.", "NTA. Your husband and his mother clearly have some issues with interpersonal communication. He could have easily deescalated without lying by saying \"mom, it isn't a big deal. I just don't remember the books.\" He doesn't need to say his had a good childhood if he didn't, but he could still have helped. And his mother shouldn't be putting you in the middle or taking out her anxiety on you all. If she messed up when he was a kid, that's hard, but it's a matter for her therapist. It's above your pay grade as her kids.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt's not your fault that she took you mentioning the classic childhood books that you wanted to get your child as an insult to her parenting because her son didn't read them.", "NTA the mom obviously a slight tweaker beware in the future over stuff like this.", "~~INFO~~ : Does your husband actually think he had a bad childhood? If not, why is he so reluctant to reassure his overly anxious mother? \n\nMy mother has similar reactions. Everytime I mention anything remotely negative about my childhood she is immediately like \"OMG, what did I do wrong?\". This is because she tried so very hard since she didn't have a great childhood herself. This is so important to her, that she is easily made insecure about it. \n\nI would vote N AH, but your husbands reaction kinda irks me. Is it so difficult to say \"Mom, I might not remember these books, but I still had a good childhood\"?", "NTA. Both your MIL and your husband is way overreacting. I don't see how your saying your husband didn't know about certain books means he \"had a bad childhood.\"\n\nIndeed, Nick could've said he had a good childhood during the discussion between the 3 of you (unless he thinks he didn't?). And to take it out on you is really beyond the pale. For both of them to not speak to you is outrageous. They owe you both an apology. \n\nHope this is unusual behavior from your husband and that he's not going to turn into a real creep.", "NTA. And you will never be TA for something like this, however, you need to 1. Tell hubbie you are not responsible for his mother's anxiety and you can not possibly anticipate everything she is going to freak out over. 2. Work out a better communication system w/ her b/c you can not be putti g this much energy into calming her. I would suggest just not saying anything extra to her ever. Just the bare basics and leave the rest to your husband.\n\nAnd yes, if she acts like this, your husband had a terrible childhood and you 2 need some couples counseling to figure out how to set boundries w/ your MIL, b/c as much as you 2 think you can handle it, she will do this to your child too and no child should have to deal w/ constantly re-assuring grandma's insecurities.", "NTA. MIL sounds a little exhausting tbh", "NTA. \nMy husband knew no nursery rhymes. Like, the tunes maybe but none of the words. I told my MIL this. \"Urgh that's Mr. knittingneedles332 for you, memory's terrible\". And then we all teased him.", "NTA.

As a new mom you're going to need rules or I fear \"Nick\" and MIL will spiral out of control with emotional swings. You may need to tell them that postpartum blues are not theirs.", "NTA but... your MIL has issues, no surprise there, but her issues have given your husband his own set of issues that are now affecting your relationship. He shouldn't be giving you the silent treatment over his mother's issues. That's completely unfair.\n\nThis isn't on you to fix - but if I were talking to him I would strongly recommend therapy to explore how his mom's anxiety affected him, how it affects his relationship with you, and how it will affect his relationship with his own children", "NAH -  Your comments were totally innocent.  Your MIL overreacted, but I guess it was a soft spot. Combine that with her anxiety, and I'd give her a pass.", "NTA. Your MIL has serious emotional problems and your husband is so obtuse about it, he threw you under the bus she's driving to meltdown town.", "Having a kid and watching them grow up is going to bring up more of these issues for Nick. He should see a therapist. NTA", "I see no assholery here, only a bad case of lack of tact tending towards ESH. You were making conversation and put your foot in your mouth. Take you MIL out for coffee, apologize for having put your foot in it, do not try to justify why it came out that way with a \"but\" groggy with sleep, bewildered that your hubby did not know the books and such. Tell her how you love what hubby brings to your life and that it is thanks to her that he does this or that.\n\nI suggest you read up on RSD - Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria. That may explain some of your MIL's reactions. RSD and anxiety feed on each other. Something I know only too well.\n\nP.S. I'd never heard of them until well into adulthood either. Nothing wrong with that.", "I know you didn't say it on purpose but when your child arrives and you as a mother will be questioned about any parent decision you make you will understand why it sounded awful. NTA", "YTA. What other reason could you have had to bring up Nick not having those books, if not to imply that he missed out in his childhood?", "YTA. Your comment definitely implies she was a neglectful parent. Why say that even if it could be true? Her reaction was a bit strong but when you have your own child you might find that your hot button is also criticism of your parenting.\n\nI read my kids books I liked, some from my own childhood and some more eclectic stuff. Some parents go old school with Little Golden Books or Dr. Seuss, or with fairy tales.

If you don't she will keep asking 'But did you like it?' over and over. If you do, she will indulge in a monologue about how hard it was to get you that present, how clever she was to find it, how fantastic she is at choosing presents.\n\nShe is exhausting, and if you let her start it's really hard to get her to stop.\n\nI believe Nick- I bet he had a miserable childhood with a self-obsessed mother who he was always forced to be emotionally responsible for.
