I know medical care in the US (and I am assuming you're a US citizen) is terrible with the way insurance operates, but that is the the current situation. It's not easy racking up medical debt. I know, it's happened to me.\n\nBut it is your mother's money and she can dole it out however she wants. In the same right, you are allowed to hold a grudge over this and never speak to her again. We all get to make choices and then live with consequences of those choices. You mother chose, and now she will face the the consequences of how she chose (good or bad).
