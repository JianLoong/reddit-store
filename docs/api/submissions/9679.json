Absolutely NTA.", "Dear OP:\n\nI feel very sorry for what you have been through. I do hope everything works out for you. It feels like a betrayal because you are literally dying and possibly would've without chemo. Knowing your mother bought something like gadgets instead of using the money to help you LIVE is a huge betrayal. You saw her true colors and are giving her the consequences of her actions. You are definitely NTA and am glad you are cured.", "I don't understand how a parent COULDN'T help their child who was diagnosed with cancer. It's one thing if she didn't have the funds to support you, but evidently, that wasn't the case.\n\nBut there isn't enough information to deduce whether you should cut her off from your life.\n\nSo currently, NTA.", "Definitely NTA. I'm happy you are recovering. Good luck.", "NTA. Your right your an adult, but your also 20 and going through a cancer diagnosis and all that entails. If your mom was broke that\u2019s one thing, but she apparently had money to buy expensive gifts for your siblings. Your mom should have made an effort to\nto help you with this. I hope she was an emotional support for you?", "NTA I cannot understand letting your child suffer & not being willing to soemhow try to help the best of your ability", "NTA - I feel like I just need a tshirt saying \u201cgenetics \u2260 obligation\u201d. I\u2019m so sorry you went through that on your own. Your mum doesn\u2019t deserve you. I hope your treatment goes well", "NTA. She made her choice, now she can live with the results of that choice.", "NTA I\u2019m baffled at this notion of once you\u2019re 18, you\u2019re on your own for good\u2026 young adults still need guidance and help from their parents not just emotional but also sometimes financial. And that\u2019s okay. \n\nPeople need to understand that once you\u2019re a parent, it\u2019s for life, you\u2019re not on some 18 years only contract. \n\nif you\u2019re planing on completely cutting off your kids at 18 don\u2019t have them at all. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry the woman who birthed you is a pathetic excuse for a mother. Stay strong and get better op \u2764\ufe0f.", "NTA. It's my belief that you're never not responsible for your kids, period. They exist only because you indulged your selfish desire to procreate. That they're adults doesn't matter - when they're in trouble, you help them. Your mom wasn't even broke or anything, she's just an AH.", "NTA\n\nI was on the fence until I saw that she was obviously financially stable.

You are 1000% NTA. I would sell pretty much everything I own if I had to to pay for a child\u2019s cancer treatment. Any loving parent I\u2019m sure would agree. The fact that you even had planned to borrow it and pay her back is even more reason you are NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say without backstory, but I dare say this isn\u2019t a good relationship in other ways anyway.", "NTA it breaks my heart that you weren\u2019t given the support that you needed from your mom. It\u2019s not like you needed the money for something trivial, you needed it for life saving treatment. Seems like your mom\u2019s priorities are all out of whack and it\u2019s totally understandable that you don\u2019t want to speak to her. I\u2019m so glad to hear that your are doing better health wise and I wish you the best going forward.", "NTA.  That is not a person who  deserves to be in your life.", "Not only wouldn't I let her in my life, I'd shame her to anyone who'd listen because it's likely she'll invent a flattering reason for your estrangement. I'd put it on my socials, tell my nosiest relatives, call her best friends...I'd burn it all down. So if all you do is cut her off, in my books you're an angel. I hope you are well now and stay that way."]}
