When my parents asked what the fine was about, I took the blame as I didn't want them to think my husband was driving recklessly. And they gave me a good lecture about driving and I just agreed.\n\n\nNow for our current living situation, I quit my job since around 8 months ago but I had a lot of savings enough to fund my expenses & my 1/2 of the house expenses until 3 months ago.
