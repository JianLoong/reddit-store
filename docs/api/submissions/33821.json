Max is in his final year of a 4-year-degree in mathematics, and he wants to go to grad school and study cancer after he earns his bachelors. He\u2019s getting straight As, he has research experience in computational biology, and right now, he\u2019s just a very kind, warm person.\n\nThe problem is that starting from when he was around 14 yrs old, Max was an absolute MONSTER. And at the age of 17, he and a few other guys aged 17-21 had extorted a retiree for her money and possessions. They didn\u2019t hurt her, and they had their own twisted sense of \u201chonor\u201d where they inflicted as little physical harm on people as possible. Mostly the guys just stole stuff and got high/drunk. My brother did serve time in prison for this crime. I and the rest of our family have forgiven him, and my parents love that he is trying to redeem himself. We come from a very impoverished background, so my parents are very gracious to Max and they want him to beat the odds. But despite all this, I can\u2019t get over Max\u2019s self-pitying claims of PTSD and mental damage from his prison sentence. I mean, you need to own it, man. You messed up. Sometimes he claims to have \u201cflashbacks\u201d when I do certain things around him, and lately I have just given up on being patient with him. He won\u2019t open up to me about what exactly he\u2019s experienced in prison, but he\u2019s acting like he\u2019s been through \u2018Nam. \n\nAITA for not being able to stand my brother\u2019s self-pity?", "created_utc": 1703640142, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ro0ap/aita_for_having_no_sympathy_for_my_younger/", "score": 586, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or maybe because of what he did in the past, you mistrust him, and therefore mistrust that he really has PTSD.\n\nHim serving his time and getting PTSD are not mutually exclusive, but if seems like you are trying to imply that if he \"owned\" that he \"messed up\" he somehow wouldn't have PTSD. This makes no sense whatsoever. Both of these things could be true or neither could be true because they do not depend on each other. He could have PTSD regardless of his \"owning it.\" Or maybe he's faking it. But if you think that, why not just say it? It feels like you're trying to justify your mistrust of him with this explanation that you're not sympathetic because he's not taking responsibility, when really, its about how YOU feel about him. It's time to be honest with yourself about why you really are doubting his claims of PTSD.\n\nSince I don't know if his claims are true or not, I'm going to err on the side of caution and assume they are, because prison in the US (assuming that's where you are) is a fucked up, dreadful place that's rife with trauma-inducing situations. Now I'm going to speculate a lot, so tell me to fuck off if I'm completely off-base here: I think your reasons for mistrusting your brother (assuming that's what's really going on) are warranted, but you would be better off facing the music of your feelings instead of trying to externalize and justify them by placing blame on your brother in this specific context. Place it where it belongs: your trust was broken when he did what he did in his youth, and now you're having a hard time trusting that he's being honest about this trauma. That's a very understandable consequence of his behavior, but when you blame him for for not \"owning it\" you come across as callous and unsympathetic because you are responding in a callous, unsympathetic way. \n\nDescribe it like it is at the crux of the matter to yourself and others (whether my interpretation is right or you have a better explanation for your reaction) if you want to be understood to not be TA.", "Is he getting therapy?

First, the way we treat prisoners in our prisons is terrible. Yes, they are paying a price but that is for their freedom, not their dignity and safety. Since most prisoners will eventually be released we really need to be better at making sure they can be productive and good citizens when released otherwise it is both punitive and dangerous for the world at large. It is not uncommon for prison guards to use more hardened criminals to punish other prisoners in violent ways or even use them to fight and bet against. Solitary confinement is horribly abusive and can lead to long term psychosis.\n\nSecond, if you aren't going to forgive him, that's up to you but why would he ever tell you what he experienced if your reaction will be \"well, suck it up.

Who\u2019s to say the poor person he tormented isn\u2019t also experiencing PTSD? \n\nThen again, I come from a developing country, where prison conditions are much worse.

I can\u2019t think of anything you would be doing to cause flashbacks to prison unless it\u2019s tossing him a bar of soap.\n\nConsidering that he was in prison for physically abusing and threatening vulnerable people, I wonder whether his self-pity is a personality trait.

I am not suggesting he did not deserve to be arrested and serve prison time, I am saying that you need to have some freaking compassion. Your brother should be nothing but applauded at this time in his life. He served his time and that left a mark on him. He is to be commended, not disbelieve and worse, mocked about what he went through and the resulting mental illness flhe got from it.", "YTA. But hear me out.\n\nIt\u2019s only because reddit doesn\u2019t find his crimes that he served time for \u201cheinous enough\u201d.\n\nIf he was a repeat kid-diddler who had gotten out after 10, people would be telling you NTA all day long.", "ESH. \n\nI think it\u2019s very likely that he is dealing with significant trauma from prison. Downplaying that doesn\u2019t make you come off well here. You should acknowledge that it\u2019s likely that he has experienced trauma and that he will be damaged as a result of it. \n\nThat being said, his trauma is a direct result of his own behaviour, and that\u2019s worth consideration. Prison might have been awful, but he was there for a repugnant crime of preying on a vulnerable person. So, to a large extent, I agree that he does need to own it and deal with it himself. Forgiving someone does not require ignoring reality or pretending like nothing happened. If I was in your position, I\u2019d ask him if he wonders whether or not the trauma that he inflicted on his elderly victim impacts her life every day. Perhaps real rehabilitation will come when he cares more about that than his own trauma. \n\nYou can acknowledge that he does have mental damage without needing to sympathise with him. But if his behaviour is truly self-pitying, then I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong to have little patience with that. Depending on what things he expects you to change, I\u2019d also consider how reasonable that is and be honest with him about how willing you are to accommodate that. Understanding his issues does not necessarily mean that you will pander to them, and when people are the architects of their own trauma, it\u2019s not unreasonable to not have sympathy.", "YTA. If you don\u2019t actually know what the experience was you should not comment on it.", "YTA try a VR prison experience for an hour", "I don't think there is enough information, to begin with OP is biased, clearly he has already decided that brother is an idiot and that's how he tells us, but is it really what happens? Prison is a horrible place that's why there are people who prefer death to her, if you are worried about your brother, talk to your family so they can convince him to go to therapy, if his trauma is real you will be helping him and if he pretends it will be a step for him to accept his responsibility", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Max is in his final year of a 4-year-degree in mathematics, and he wants to go to grad school and study cancer after he earns his bachelors. He\u2019s getting straight As, he has research experience in computational biology, and right now, he\u2019s just a very kind, warm person.\n\nThe problem is that starting from when he was around 14 yrs old, Max was an absolute MONSTER. And at the age of 17, he and a few other guys aged 17-21 had extorted a retiree for her money and possessions. They didn\u2019t hurt her, and they had their own twisted sense of \u201chonor\u201d where they inflicted as little physical harm on people as possible. Mostly the guys just stole stuff and got high/drunk. My brother did serve time in prison for this crime. I and the rest of our family have forgiven him, and my parents love that he is trying to redeem himself. We come from a very impoverished background, so my parents are very gracious to Max and they want him to beat the odds. But despite all this, I can\u2019t get over Max\u2019s self-pitying claims of PTSD and mental damage from his prison sentence. I mean, you need to own it, man. You messed up. Sometimes he claims to have \u201cflashbacks\u201d when I do certain things around him, and lately I have just given up on being patient with him. He won\u2019t open up to me about what exactly he\u2019s experienced in prison, but he\u2019s acting like he\u2019s been through \u2018Nam. \n\nAITA for not being able to stand my brother\u2019s self-pity?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That's part of why it doesn't actually \"fix\" criminals very often: If you gather up a bunch of somewhat unstable people and force them all to live together, a lot of them are going to come out broken and/or worse than when they went in. You could stand to have some compassion for that. \n\nThat compassion is completely separate from holding him accountable for what he did - on both accounts, yours and his. You can be compassionate for the trauma he experienced in prison without dismissing the fact that he did something horrible, and that was why he was in prison in the first place. He can struggle with PTSD, and need compassion in that regard, without dismissing the fact that he has done something horrible enough that it may well have traumatized another person. The facts are related, but also separate. \n\nIf you don't feel that you can forgive your brother fully enough to have compassion for his PTSD, even if you don't know the specific details of the experience, then maybe you shouldn't spend time with your brother.

Sounds cruel and unusual if you ask me.", "well if veterans didnt join the military they wouldnt have ptsd. if r*pe victims did insert whatever victim blaming thing you want they wouldnt have ptsd. prison was the consequence, not ptsd. it shouldnt be used against him, especially when you dont know how he got it exactly. he could have been a victim of r*pe in prison. i really hope you dont think thats a good punishment", "No, he would have got PTSD because of something that was done to him WHILE he was in prison. Like being raped. \n\nIf OP is purposely triggering a rape victim by doing something like going up behind him, then it's also for OP's wellbeing to stop doing that.", "Yes they did and ive never cried poor me for the experience. That's the difference", "Why you keep trying to send me dick pics?", "I really hope to god you don\u2019t have people with mental illness in your life. Max sounds like a good dude who took ownership and turned his life around, he stole from people he didn\u2019t murder someone but imagine what he\u2019s been through in prison where he paid his dues (his freedom) and reformed among way more evil people. I imagine he has possible been physically abused and almost certainly suffered mentally abuse which equates to PTSD. Which he is within his right to communicate his triggers - this is extremely healthy and helps healing and not pushing people away. \n\nNot wanting to talk to his brother who thinks he deserves the PTSD because he commited a crime before his pre frontal cortex had even finished developing is a pretty reasonable boundary. OP shouldn\u2019t have anything to do with him until he goes to therapy to sort out his fucking resentment for the people around him rooting for his brother to succeed.", "Genuine question if you were the victim of a crime do you think that you would want to hear any apologies from that person", "I'm sorry I didn't realize you personally knew this guy. OP said nothing about him not being rehabilitated, thats something you pulled out of your own ass, as you should with your head if you ever get the chance.", "No you don\u2019t.", "Taking classes in prison, you can get good grades too!\n\nBut  (A's) are good regardless of where earned.\n\nYou never know if someone is good or bad until they act out.\n\nHaving worked with ex-con's has been enough proof for me, time alone is the real deciding factor.", "I'm not sure it takes rape, for example, to learn.", "Yes, just because the American system does doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s the point of it. Educate yourself and get some empathy.", "a LOT of veterans commit many heinous crimes in other countries and are never actually punished for it tho. regardless, how would you feel if you did stupid awful things as a kid, and then went to prison for it, turned your life completely around, and then had people rooting for your downfall and intentionally triggering your ptsd because you were stupid and awful as a kid despite the fact that its been a decade", "He's not crying poor me.  He's asking his sibling not to fuck with him and treat him like shit, because he has PTSD.  Not the same thing.  You know bad shit goes down in prison, and that can fuck people up.  \n\nJFC", "He can 'pay his dues' until the cows come home.   I absolutely agree that op shouldn't have to have anything to do with him, no untils involved.", "Never said he was either. Reading isn't your strength", "Why because I don't feel a certain way about criminals?  This dude didn't get popped for a dime bag and thrown in prison for it. He stole from a fucking old lady. I'm not throwing a pity party for him that he had to pay a price for that. I also won't lose sleep over his current problems due to his punishment.  NEITHER WILL YOU. You're just looking for outrage karma that someone isn't fake crying about another's self inflicted issues.", "Maybe next time he will think of committing a felony against the elderly", "Lmao man you like making that comment about reading it might just hurt my feelings if you repeat it a third time. She said, and I quote, \"right now, he's just a very kind, warm person.\" Read that fuck boy", "Yeah sure okay bub", "Why do you insist he isn't rehabilitated and you are chucklehead? You don't know him. You don't know what he went through.  But from the sound of it you would join the brother in fucking with him and making the PTSD worse, which is fucking torture, so maybe YOU need another stint in the joint.", "Lmao fuck boy?", "After all your hand wringing that's it?", "Ok if he's rehabilitated then sounds like prison did its job. I'll continue to keep my sympathy for the actual victim in this the old lady", "Yes."]}
