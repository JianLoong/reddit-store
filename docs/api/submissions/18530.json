I voted against it but everyone else was fine to give him a second chance so he got an invite.\n\nWe went to a southern coast to do some some snorkelling and spearfishing.  The spot is known for sharks, but Michael had been there a few times before and swore by it and we trust him. We all hopped into the boat and went out to the spot, but Darren decided against diving and wanted to stay on the boat and fish so we said go for gold and the rest of us jumped in. I was actually relived by this because I did not trust him with a speargun.\n\nWe\u2019d been in the water about 5-10 minutes when I noticed a red colour in the water. My heart sank thinking the worst, and my dive partner and I immediately went to the surface to look around. We started swimming for the boat and noticed a commotion which in my mind confirmed my fears, but when I climbed on the other\u2019s were on board and looked fine. I was still panicked and asked about the blood in the water and whose it was. That\u2019s when Michael told us that Darren fucking chummed the water with some blended up mullet to attract sharks to catch. \n\nI went the fuck off, I honestly can\u2019t remember what I said exactly but it was along the lines of him being the dumbest person to ever be shat into this planet. Darren tried explaining that he wanted to catch something big to impress us since he was still feeling insecure about last time but I said not good enough. You risked our lives to boost your ego, how can I trust someone like that to be around?? He went home early shortly after we got back to shore, the rest of us said good riddance but Michael brought up that he didn\u2019t mean to put us in harms way and that he just wanted to fit in. \n\nI personally don\u2019t feel like an asshole, but it\u2019s true that he didn\u2019t have any bad intentions.

AITA for yelling at a guy for attracting sharks to the water we were diving in??\n\nEdit: first few commenters are saying he had bad intentions but I am sure he wasn\u2019t actually trying to put us in harms way, just couldn\u2019t put 2 and 2 together.
