Utterly harmless.\n\nTiger sharks can be quite dangerous, as the other commenter noted. The trouble with chumming is you can attract the more aggressive species in the area, depending on where you are (hammerheads, mako, great white even).  Chumming is also dangerous because sharks commonly have feeding frenzies, which is NOT something you want to be in the water for", "YOu are right.", "Oh yeah, I mentioned whale sharks because I knew they are harmless and have swam with them before. (Unless you get too close and accidentally hit by their tail.)\n\nI also had that hunch about feeding frenzies too but couldn\u2019t remember what sets them off (if it\u2019s just due to blood being in the water or a combination of blood and thrashing prey). Either way, you do not want to be in the water when one of those is happening!", "You\u2019ve swum with whale sharks?! You lucky b*stard, that\u2019s incredible! \n\nI believe frenzies are triggered by the combo of blood and movement in the water? I\u2019d have to check though.\n\nEither way.

He *chummed* the water in order to *attract **sharks***. Holy shit. Again; NTA.
