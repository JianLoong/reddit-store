After we sent out invites, my SIL got pregnant and will be due 2 month before the wedding. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is more passionate than I am about the no kids thing, and really didn\u2019t appreciate when his sister initially assumed her baby would be an exception. She ended up reaching out over text to ask for an exception and if her newborn can be there, saying she wasn\u2019t comfortable with anyone watching the baby, but prefaced \u201cno pressure\u201d in the ask. \n\nHe got back to her reiterating we understood but unfortunately we\u2019ve had to tell other family and friends who are in similar situations they can\u2019t, but really it\u2019s our one big day so hope she understood, and so as a solution we offered our bridal suite as a base for baby and parents throughout the entirely of the wedding, but would appreciate no children including new borns at the ceremony and dinner. \n\nThis did not go over well. She said she was disappointed and hurt by our decision, essentially pinning it on me versus her brother, and said everyone they know that could watch the baby will be at the wedding, the room offer didn\u2019t work for them, and it\u2019s best they don\u2019t attend.\n\nAITA for being upset about this entire situation? Am I truly missing something? I don\u2019t care to see anything about babes in arm exceptions. One of the main reasons why many, including ourselves, choose to have no kids at weddings is to avoid the inevitable disruptions that come alongside that. We plan on getting married once and would ideally like to not have a baby crying during our vows and speeches. \n\nWe really felt like our offer of our suite, on our wedding day, was a good compromise but essentially her reply indicates that unless the baby can be there strapped to her body, regardless of what we want, then she won\u2019t be there. From the beginning this has felt like a no win situation. No solutions presented from the other side, or other compromises just\u2026we aren\u2019t coming unless we get our way, which has left both of us confused and obviously very upset.", "created_utc": 1678559141, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11or5uy/aita_for_supporting_fianc\u00e9s_decision_to_tell_his/", "score": 1042, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are allowed to say no children and she's allowed to say she won't come or compromise.", "NTA\n\nWhile your compromise seemed like a good idea, you ideally don\u2019t want to leave a two month old baby alone. So someone was going to miss the wedding regardless, whether the parents took turns or the grandparents jumped in once in awhile. Either way, it wasn\u2019t a good fit.\n\nSIL shouldn\u2019t have tried to pin it on you, (and your husband should have said it was both your guys\u2019 idea), but choosing to not have children at your wedding means some people won\u2019t come. That\u2019s just something you\u2019ll have to accept.", "I really don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s the idiot in this scenario! Is there an acronym for that? Edit: NAH\n\nYou want your wedding to be child free, no exceptions. That\u2019s fair enough; your special day, your rules. \n\nYour sister is due to have an 8 week old baby. Those things can be fussy and clingy- my little monster was definitely a cluster feeding boob-barnacle and I was an under-slept, leaky mess at that time. I tore really badly and still hadn\u2019t healed. If your sis ends up having a c-section then the healing time is 10 weeks minimum. \n\nYour offer of the bridal suite is a really generous gesture, but really won\u2019t work for a baby this small. At this age the newborn still hasn\u2019t figured out that they\u2019re not part of mum yet (it\u2019s called the fourth trimester for a reason)and are just happiest strapped to a parent. \n\nSo there really isn\u2019t a solution here. You don\u2019t want to compromise your day and your sister can\u2019t come if she abides by your rules. I can understand frustration on both sides and I think this is a situation where both sides agree to disagree.

And you are an AH if you are upset that your SIL didn\u2019t wait till after your wedding to have a baby.  your line about everyone having a year heads up on your wedding date makes it seem like SIL getting pregnant during the year long prep for your big day rubbed you the wrong way.  No one has to put their life on hold for your wedding day.", "NAH ...\nFor your sil: Many people would not want to leave their new born with someone else and they need constant care at that age. So she can't come. She's upset about it and that's ok, she probably would have quite liked to be at her brothers wedding. A lot of people have a childfree wedding but make exceptions for either close family or newborns (or both). \n\nYou are entitled to not want kids at your wedding. I get it. I didn't either but we still had exceptions. You can stick to your guns to have the day how you want but it is you and your fiance who have to deal with the consequences of your choice which at the moment is a childfree wedding without your sil. \n\nYou want a solution. Just ask if the baby is not sleeping or starts making any noise during the ceremony and speeches that she take it out. Ask that she sits near a door. Politely.", "NAH. Wanting a child-free wedding is fine, them not attending in that case is also fine. Yes, they should not have assumed that they would be an exception, but neither can you expect them to come if they are not comfortable with their newborn elsewhere.", "NAH, it's your right to invite to your wedding whomever you want to, but yeah it's also her right to not attend. \n\nA newborn is a different situation than a child. A child can be watched by other people more easily. Newborns, especially when they are breastfeeding are not that simple.\n\nI attended a wedding with my 8 month old and my mom stayed in a hotel room with him at the location, still I had to leave the party several times to feed him, calm him etc. \n\nI wouldn't attend a wedding with a newborn either for that reason. So if you would be mad that she is not coming, that would change my judgement tbh", "NAH. You\u2019re allowed to have a child free wedding, your FSIL is allowed to not want to be away from her newborn. Like she said, everyone who could watch the baby will be at the wedding so even if the bridal suite suggestion would work multiple people would have to miss parts of the wedding. Plus, if she\u2019s breastfeeding she can\u2019t really be away from the baby so staying in a room all night doesn\u2019t sound like fun. You can have a child free wedding but you can\u2019t be upset about people not attending.", "INFO: I just am very confused about who would be in the suite with the baby. If it\u2019s mom, then she\u2019s just sitting in a room there and not part of the festivities at all. Or were you envisioning her and her partner rotating through the evening? Presumably you don\u2019t want other family (your in-laws) dashing off to take baby sitting shifts. What were you imagining?", "NTA for wanting no kids at the wedding. You would be the AH for expecting or insisting the sister with a new born to attend. The sister would not be the AH to graciously decline the invite. She is the AH for throwing a fit about the reasonable rule instead of just declining the invite.", "There really is no good compromise when it comes to a two-month-old nursling. Either you give the exception or she doesn\u2019t come. It\u2019s okay for her to ask and for her to be hurt, it\u2019s okay for you to say no. You just have to decide what\u2019s most important to you. NAH.", "The SIL can politely decline and they can want a child free wedding. It\u2019s in both their rights. It doesn\u2019t make them the asshole for wanting that nor does it make the SIL for not wanting to leave their child and declining. They even tried to find a middle group to allow her to be there for part of it.\n\nBut if the SIL can think she can dictate what happens at someone else wedding is a little over the top. This sub is full of \u201cit\u2019s your wedding, no one can tell you what to do\u201d responses. what makes this any different?", "NTA\n\nMany people don't have children at their weddings. I did, but that was my choice and my husband agreed. We liked the randomness of kids during these times. But again, that was our choice. Many if not most people choose no children during at least the ceremony. A friend of mine wanted no kids. Her MOH/best friend said she wouldn't go if her kids weren't invited. Eventually my friend gave her the exception and invited only her kids. Then MOH insisted her family gets front row at the ceremony. Everyone knew her kids were loud. But my friend had to agree if she wanted her MOH/best friend to attend. It went horrible. But, in the end, my friend had a great wedding and enjoyed her time. She and her MOH/best friend no longer speak to each other since the event. It's a shame when entitled people force themselves into these situations. Relationships get really strained. \n\nYour SIL needs to accept your rules, find someone to watch her baby, or don't attend. It's understandable how upsetting this is for both of you (SIL and your fianc\u00e9) but he set the rules and she needs to accept them. It's not about her. This is about you and your fianc\u00e9's big day.", "Can her partner stay in the bridal suite with the baby for the ceremony and dinner, just so she can be there, then they can both take off?", "NTA I\u2019m sick of people reading these invitations as \u2018no kids except mine\u2019. If you don\u2019t like the rule then don\u2019t go to the wedding, the world doesn\u2019t start revolving around you because you pushed out some kid.", "I couldn\u2019t have attended a wedding at 2 months postpartum without my baby. They need their mothers and especially if it\u2019s their first, it\u2019s very difficult to allow someone else to watch them. Not to mention if they\u2019re exclusively breastfed, that\u2019s a whole other issue. I did attend a wedding with my newborn and my husband and I took turns to take the baby out the second she got fussy. She didn\u2019t disrupt anything because we got her out of there immediately and we sat in a spot that allowed us to do that discreetly.\n\nIt\u2019s all good to say no babies, no kids.\nYour SIL should have politely declined once she got your answer about not bringing her newborn.\nNTA", "NTA - they have the option of not attending.

The baby will not starve to death or be damaged by someone watching them in the bridal suite.", "Every time someone I know has brought an infant that age to a wedding it literally slept the entire time and did nothing, it was mostly out of convenience for the breastfeeding mum being able to attend more easily. It was never a big deal at like 10 weddings with a tiny tiny newborn, but you\u2019re also not wrong for not wanting a baby there if you say no kids. NAH but also having been to close to a dozen weddings where the only child was a 2 month old or less newborn, there was absolutely no disruption, fuss or even really attention paid to the baby beyond \u201coh cute baby is sleeping\u201d", "NTA\n\nYou are free to make your wedding child free and she is free not to attend if she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable having anyone who won\u2019t be at the wedding watch the child.

Your fiance is more adamant then you are about no kids, yet somehow you are the monster and will make a horrible mother?!? I wanted a child free wedding and got guilt tripped into having 7 children there and I hated it. I was miserable all day at my own wedding bcuz the kids wouldn't shut up and their parents wouldn't stop them. We actually had to stop our vows bcuz one of my nephews started running through the venue and the youngest (like 3 months old) started screaming at the top of his lungs. Don't let you SIL try to ruin this for you guys, enjoy your day and ignore the ignorant people on Reddit. Wishing you and your future hubby much love and happiness", "NTA. \n\nIt is your decision to have a child free wedding, and honestly, these people that think they get \u201cexceptions\u201d kill me. \n\nYou would only be the AH if you get pissed at her for not coming.

However, I know I wouldn't have attended a wedding at 2 months postpartum without my newborn. \n\nMaybe nta if her reaction really does warrant calling her an AH, but it's hard to judge that from the limited info we have and only getting one side of the story. She is probably also very hurt at the thought of missing her brother's wedding and may feel like she is being punished for getting pregnant. That may not be true, but it does happen, and pregnancy hormones will make you feel ALL the feelings, especially in an already emotional situation like missing a large milestone event for someone you love. \n\nAlso, you may want to add some clarification to your post, as in comments, it seems that you're upset over the way she is reacting, specifically about blaming and being angry with you, which is totally fair. Your post itself makes it seem more like you're upset with her and the fact that she won't come without the baby, which would put this more into esh or yta territory, and that's why you're getting some of those judgements on this post.", "Why are you posting this again when you asked this same question a month ago?", "NTA, I have a 2 month old and she could be all smiles and happy one minute and screaming her head off the next. Would not take her to a wedding even if children are welcome.", "NAH. Echoing what others have said. You are entitled to a child free wedding, although I confess that is not something I actually understand at all and would ever even consider for myself. But your SIL and other invited guests with children are within their rights to decline your invitation specifically because your wedding is child free, particularly as the child in question will be a newborn, I would say no as well. \n\nHer not saying she can\u2019t be there is not an ultimatum and is a decision most parents of newborns would make in her shoes. \n\nWith regards to your issue with bearing the brunt of the blame, I agree that is not fair, has your fianc\u00e9 made it clear that the final decision was his and that he was the one who was more adamant then you that the answer was no.", "NAH, you are allowed to have a child free wedding but you have to accept that it means some people will not attend. Especially someone with a newborn.", "NAH\n\nno kids means no kids, and I grinned a bit about \"including newborns\" because I think \"especially newborns\" since they are the most likely interrupting the ceremony. But your sister in law is not an AH for saying \"no\" as well. You want her to accept your No, well, that should be a two way train. I mean I'd be annoyed, not enough for an AITA post though, of her expressing disappointment but I would surely not think she's wrong declining the compromise. See, I am a strong believe in nobody needs to have an excuse or explanation for their \"no\" in most cases [sorry, I am German, I am precise, I can think of very weird situations a \"No\" would need an explanation, totally unrelated situations nobody would never think of...).\n\nAlthough, maybe the compromise would work if a bit better thought through. I mean if everyone who can watch the baby theoretically is at the wedding wouldn't it be possible to make some baby watching plan with these family members involved? Of course these should all stay sober until their shift would be over but, speaking from experience, those you'd watch your newborn are most likely those who have no problem not to drink. Geez... my Mum would probably take the whole shift and I could be glad she'd be at the ceremony lol. Well, my mum is a bit kids crazy (sorr Mum none of your four daughters gave you grandchildren). I probably could send my Mum to you do the job...\n\nAnyway, I am not a mother but even I can understand that you can not let a newborn unsupervised in that room, not even for short. And I can even understand if your sister in law doesn't let anyone do the job no matter what. It is her right, her decision, as it is for you two not to have kids at the wedding.", "NTA, but not so sure why you're upset.  You offered her a perfectly fine alternative and she said no.

I feel like their compromise with the suite should have been fine.\n\nI don't understand why so many people are saying Y T A here, a newborn from my experience (which i'll admit isn't much) is way too loud to been expected to be an exception for an event where there should not be any interruptions, such as a baby crying.", "NAH\n\nShe's not TA for not coming to your wedding and you're not the AH for making your wedding child free.\n\nWhen my second was around 2 months I went to a child free wedding.

Most daycares don't take babies under 3mo and many parents, especially post Covid, don't use any childcare under 3mo for health reasons as their immune systems are still developing when they are so little. Since presumably all family members they'd be comfortable relying on will be at the wedding, they are stuck unless they (in their eyes, I would guess) put their baby's health at risk. \n\nSIL did not handle this well, but I would be upset if I felt like I had to choose between the wellbeing of my newborn and my own brother's wedding. However, that doesn't make it your fault.", "NAH - you want a child free wedding and that\u2019s ok, but you must accept that it may eliminate some people from attending.", "My wife and I had a general no-kids wedding but allowed children of the wedding party to attend. However years later, we just wish that we allowed children to attend the wedding.

She ended up reaching out over text to ask for an exceptions and if her newborn can be there, saying she wasn\u2019t comfortable with anyone watching the baby, but prefaced \u201cno pressure\u201d in the ask. \n\nHe got back to her reiterating we understood but unfortunately we\u2019ve had to tell other family and friends who are in similar situations they can\u2019t, but really it\u2019s our one big day so hope she understood, and so as a solution we offered our bridal suite as a base for baby and parents throughout the entirely of the wedding, but would appreciate no children including new borns at the ceremony and dinner. \n\nThis did not go over well. She said she was disappointed and hurt by our decision, essentially pinning it on me versus her brother, and said everyone they know that could watch the baby will be at the wedding, the room offer didn\u2019t work for them, and it\u2019s best they don\u2019t attend.\n\nAITA for being upset about this entire situation?

You can prioritize a reception where you can pretend (and yes, it's imaginary) that you are 100% the center of attention, or a reception where adults may feel it's more acceptable to get absolutely trashed.  Accept that some people will be hurt by your priorities, and they have a right to their feelings.\n\nYour offer of the suite was likely intended to be generous, but it's simply not practical.

That's a mum thing that you guys are missing. So, your decision to keep your approach means that you are excluding the either her spouse or herself in a way that's telling her that you did not want her in the wedding, which can feel pretty ratty to take from one's brother.\n\nThen again feeling entitled to be there even when she has that new born and pushing that on the couple of the hour is pretty ratty as well.\n\nEdit:\n\nLooking at your question, yes, YWTA for being upset when they can't come without their baby.

I was already thinking you were a minor ah for not making an exception for very literal babes-in-arms, but that's my take and your choice. But you absolutely CANNOT demand that a very new mother attend your wedding by rules that make it untenable for her. Get your head straight: you can insist on your own rules; you cannot insist that people join your little kingdom/queendom to be subject to those rules. \n\nThey're not refusing to strong-arm you: they're refusing because the terms you've laid down can't work for them.

We\u2019ve skipped no kid weddings bc of logistics and the couple was (once especially) shocked and disappointed that my husband wasn\u2019t attending his best friends wedding but it literally made no sense with our 6 month old (the plan was to leave the kids with a sitter and we all get on a bus to another town- nope).

I can see why people do it, though. The few kids who actually came were well-behaved; what annoyed me was the adults shushing them and making a fuss over them fidgeting. I didn't hear anything the kids were doing, but I could hear their hard-of-hearing grandmother scream-whispering \"SHHHHH\" every few minutes. Same thing with airplanes--it's not the children who bother me, it's the adults.", "YTA.  You are within your rights to insist on a childfree wedding, but you also have to accept this your choice means some people will not attend.

Some may call that simply a personal choice, but I think when you make deliberate choices that exclude close friends and family through no fault of their own, that makes YTA.\n\nAlso, am I reading this right? Do you really expect her to leave a newborn baby alone in a hotel suite while she attends the ceremony? And you actually think that this is a viable option that a responsible parent of a newborn would consider? You need a reality check. She isn\u2019t choosing not to attend. You have essentially disinvited her.", "I don't \"get\" the whole child free wedding thing. It's as if the bride and groom expect the rest of the family and friends to cease existing so they can have their perfect Disney fairy tale wedding. Life is not like that. It is comical, it is loud, it is unpredictable and it can be full of love and friends if allowed instead of ridiculous expectations. \n\nHope the \"perfect\" wedding is worth losing family members over. If you have kids some day, you will understand how parents protect their babies and do not trust leaving them to others they don't know. Maybe you will find yourself excluded from events too.", "Edit: changed judgement to NAH as poster has said she is upset for being blamed by the SIL. \n\nY W B T A if you\u2019re upset that they are not going to attend without their two month old.

I don't want a baby at my wedding, and I think that's okay to say! Really appreciate your response though.
