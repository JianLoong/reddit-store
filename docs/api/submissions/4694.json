{"id": 4694, "submission_id": "zlind3", "title": "AITA for not forcing my son to speak to his father when he was upset?", "selftext": "I have three kids with my ex, Steve. For over 2 years now, I have primary physical custody of the kids and he sees them for 5-10 hours on the weekend, by mutual agreement. We have also unofficially agreed to have phone calls twice a week on specific days. \n\nI try not to butt into the phone calls, but I do monitor to make sure they're not getting into my apps, as it's on my phone and they're too young to have their own phones. Steve has also asked me to help them stay focused to have quality phone calls, which I do if they're just goofing off taking screenshots or whatever. I am good about keeping the phone calls or communicating to reschedule on occasion when needed. \n\nI strongly dislike Steve for a variety of good reasons, but act cordial and polite for the kids to the point that even Steve believes he still has a chance with me. However, he tends to get argumentative and insulting very quickly when he doesn't get his way, and I have to just disconnect or walk away to avoid a distressing scene in front of the kids, which he has done countless times before I grew a spine and stopped letting it happen.\n\nOn Steve's last phone call day, two of the kids, Chris and Drew, had just had an embarrassing (to them) upset in the sport they are in, and they were feeling mad and sad about it. During the phone call, Steve talked with Drew first, and it didn't go well. Steve kind of lectured Drew and I could tell it wasn't helping Drew feel better. They finished the conversation, Drew handed his other brother Brandon the phone, and when Brandon was done, it was Chris's turn. \n\nChris (7M) plays on the same team and was having a really hard time dealing with the defeat. He was sitting quietly in the room reading a book, still glowering but trying to calm himself down. I told Chris it was his turn and held the phone out, and he didn't move. I said \"come on, it's time to talk to Dad\" and he said \"NO.\" I said \"Don't you want to talk to Dad?\" and he said \"NO\" again. Steve could hear and see all of this on the video call. I turned the phone around to me and said \"well, it sounds like Chris isn't ready to talk to you right now.\" \n\nSteve says \"come on, can I at least tell him I love him?\" And I said \"he said NO pretty clearly two times, I think we need to respect that. Maybe you can make him a quick video and I'll show it to him when he calms down.\" Steve started to roll his eyes and put his hands up in the air, and so I said \"well, sorry about that, have a good night\" and hung up. \n\nSteve later sent me a text about how I'm harming the kids by my actions and that I should be ashamed of myself. I disagree. I think it's important to teach kids consent and boundaries in relationships, and I think we model this by respecting when they're not ready to talk. They have to do plenty of things they don't want to do every day, but if Chris is doing all he can to control himself and can't handle a conversation at the moment, I think we have to be the adults and not take it personally.

Is he well-intentioned, or is he a narcissist?\n\nOn a side note, it's a little concerning the kids were taking a loss so hard in the first place.  It's just a game.  One of the big reasons to have kids play sports at all is to teach sportsmanship, and acting like an AH (even for a little kid) isn't acceptable after a loss.  I'm not saying you should have made him speak with his dad, it seems like you read the room correctly, but it should be made clear that when they lose a game, they can't clam up and treat everyone else badly because of it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
