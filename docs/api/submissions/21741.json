I would just get a badge with the words \u201cI need space\u201d for the leash, hopefully that\u2019ll filter out most of the would-be petters (and give you a good reason to give a sharp telling off to anyone ignoring the words and attempting to pet him).", "NTA Tell them it's a werewolf and it's looking for food.", "NTA. That's rude as hell, don't blame you for being tired of it.\n\nDepending on his coat color(s), you might be able to use a temporary dye or hair chalk (they make those for dogs) to make him look like a dark, solid-colored dog. People tend to be a little warier of black dogs, so it might cut down on the nonsense.", "NTA. You don't owe anything to strangers.", "Get a vest for him. I have a yellow one that says \u201cDog in Training\u201d. You could probably get one custom made with don\u2019t touch, or something similar", "NTA.

If your girlfriend is so uncomfortable with that, maybe don't take your dog on dates?", "YTA for pretending you don't notice. They're already imagining themselves petting the dog: if you do not assertively protect him, then you aren't doing your job. If one of these people makes him anxious enough, the interaction could go in a way that's dangerous for him and others.\n\nDepending on how comfortable your dog is with these approaches, you might need to be very firm, or you might be able to agree to some interaction. But you should signal to him that you are okay with anyone you are letting pet him and you should be the person saying no when no is the answer. He should understand that it's not his job to defend himself against difficult people: you will handle that. \n\nA \"do not pet\" harness or leash will discourage some. (I know too many service dog handlers to think it will work on everyone.) But your dog deserves you to stay on top of things. \n\nI talk to my dog *all the time* in public. He's deaf. This is not for his benefit. It signals to the hearing humans we encounter that I am paying attention and will be on top of anything that happens -- because, like yours, he's big enough that some people perceive him as dangerous.", "YTA. Grow up or don't take the dog out with you all the time.", "YTA, I have an unusual breed of dog and get stopped whenever she\u2019s out with us.

Even though it is annoying, when you go out in public with a dog like that peo are going to be drawn to it and curious. It takes practice, but you can briefly answer a question or two and move on without being rude. Of you don't like the attention and it stressed it out, leave your dog at home when you go on outings.", "Light YTA/NAH.\n\nYes, it is annoying, but people are just being curious.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This guy intentionally got a very large, very unique looking dog and now he's surprised that people are commenting on it.

You are using the same argument that people use to justify harassing/touching/asking physically disabled people and their mobility aids, black people and their hair, trans people and their genitals. It's absolutely horrifying! People (and their dogs) should be allowed to be outside without being harassed constantly. \n\nA counter point: my sister will notice people looking at her dog when they are walking together, and if she is in the mood, she will offer to let people say hi to the pup. That's really sweet, and kind, and makes everyone involved really happy! Imagine a world where this was the norm. People would know it's only ok if they offer. How much better this would be, for everyone! Reactive dogs would be protected, unique/unusual dogs wouldn't be mobbed every few minutes. I would guess incidents of dog bitting would go way down!
