They're already imagining themselves petting the dog: if you do not assertively protect him, then you aren't doing your job. If one of these people makes him anxious enough, the interaction could go in a way that's dangerous for him and others.\n\nDepending on how comfortable your dog is with these approaches, you might need to be very firm, or you might be able to agree to some interaction. But you should signal to him that you are okay with anyone you are letting pet him and you should be the person saying no when no is the answer. He should understand that it's not his job to defend himself against difficult people: you will handle that. \n\nA \"do not pet\" harness or leash will discourage some.

My last dog was a red mlerle Australian shepherd and it was a problem his entire life, I just learned to accept it. At least in the US, people like animals and saying hi to people\u2019s dogs is a normal thing. That said, it really is next level how much more attention you get when you have an uncommon dog.\n\nIgnoring anyone is rude but I get it. There\u2019s a limit to the amount of people I want to talk to in general, not to mention how hard it can be to simply get your dog to poop when you get stopped mid walk and people want to know about your dog. If you ignored everyone, I\u2019d say YTA but that doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s your normal reaction from the story. \n\nFWIW, you might have more luck if you use a head harness. Majority of people don\u2019t know the difference between a muzzle and a head harness and will leave you alone. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people bother service dogs with vests on but people tend to steer away from dogs wearing (what they think are) muzzles. The leash sleeves seem decent but I don\u2019t see them as any better then using a vest - same issue of non-dog people don\u2019t know about leash sleeves so they don\u2019t care. Similarly they don\u2019t know head harnesses are just another kind of harness and assume it\u2019s a muzzle, so to speak I used that ignorance against them to be left alone\n\nLearning dog body language is also a really useful skill. You mention you think your dog is overwhelmed, that\u2019s really important to notice. With my aussie I missed the signs that kids were bothering him too much and he ended up hating kids after he grew up interacting with them nearly every day. Not all dogs care for attention, some will be nice to kids but still hate interacting with them, etc. it\u2019s important to be able to read a dog before they themselves feel the need to react because that reaction can be bad even if it\u2019s a warning. I mean my dog was 80lbs, so I can tell you a parent generally will not be happy if a 150lb dog barks at their kid to leave them alone even if the kid was harassing them", "I can't imagine that a dog would be SOOOO Unique Lookikg that dozens of people stop you every single day lol", "NTA why would anyone need to know this?", "NTA but people will continue to ask.

My other dog would want to search everyone she could for treats or snacks if she had the slightest chance. She gets ridiculously excited by people we have done so much training with her but she's a rescue and people will still try to stroke her after telling them no as she is scrabbling and trying to jump up at them.
