My two older sisters (32, 30) both have kids. My third sister (27) doesn't and is getting married at the end of the month. I (23) also don't have children but my partner & I hope to have some in the future. Oldest sister lives overseas with her husband and so is mostly irrelevant in this situation - her and sister 3 don't speak.\n\nAnyway, sister 3 is having a childfree wedding. She is, like, aggressively childfree. We don't really get along.\n\nSo, basically, our parents are old farts (lol love them) and can no longer drive. I can't drive, either, but my husband can, as can my older sister. She's a single mom, though, and had no one to watch her kids.\n\nMy husband & soon to be BIL hate each other. They grew up together and theres just lots of hard feelings there, so my husband wasn't going to the wedding. I was going to have him drop me off.\n\nIn the end, last weekend, after months of anxiety, I said I would stay with the kids so my parents and sister could go. She will drive them and attend in my place. Once we decided my husband gave the okay to work on the day of the wedding.\n\nMy sister lost it at that. Then decided she would have someone else drive our parents and asked me to come. I told her no, my older sister wants to go - I'd rather her there, anyway, as if one of our parens falls or something she knows what to do.\n\nSister lost it and said I was being selfish. This is where I may be the asshole;\n\nI then told her I didn't see the point in going to an event half the family would be missing from (referencing the kids). \n\nShe said it shouldn't matter to me, because I don't have kids. I then said they were better company than her & point blank refused to attend her wedding. Even if the kids have a babysitter, which sister is now offering to pay for, I wouldn't go.\n\nShe's so upset. I feel a little bad, but not much.\n\nMy oldest sister says I'm in the right, second sister says she feels really bad. Our parents aren't really acknowledging the situation. I think they just want to see their daughter get married.\n\nAITA?\n\nI can definitely see both sides of this and I'm conflicted. The more I think about it the closer I get to apologising and offering to go, even though I don't want to.\n\nETA; Everyone who was asking about the drama between my husband & BIL - here you go. I had to get permission from my SIL before I could share.\n\nMy SIL (husbands sister) and soon to be BIL (sisters almost husband) dated in high-school. He got her pregnant and dipped. He tried to force an abortion on her, accused her of cheating, the whole shebang. \n\nWhen she had the baby she had a DNA test done and sued him for child support. The entire time he was slating her name, making her feel horrible - tried to force her to put their son up for adoption. \n\nWhen their son was five months old he passed away due to an undetected medical issue. She was suffering, hospitalised. \n\nBIL made a post about being free from the shackles of his \"bank draining baby mama\" and went on a partying streak to celebrate. Insists that she's a bad mom, even now, and has never once visited his sons grave (and skipped his funeral). Didn't tell his own family members that he'd passed away and they also missed his funeral. \n\nMy husband fucking hates him. He ended up having to work overtime to help pay for the funeral as a fifteen year old because BIL refused to step up. He doesn't even acknowledge his son.\n\nMy SIL is still recovering, no thanks to him, but has welcomed a baby girl in the past year and she is an amazing mom. \n\nThe term \"bad blood\" is an understatement.", "created_utc": 1690914467, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fklj7/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_sisters_childfree/", "score": 8498, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And she's proud of it.\n\nLast time I went out with her we saw a young mom with a couple toddlers in a store. Like, walmart, nothing special. The babies were crying and my sister made a whole show about calling over a literal security guard and asking him to remove the children because they were disruptive. \n\nLike, she hates kids.

I'm not trying to say my thoughts on child free weddings, but I do think its one thing to say \"no one under 21\" and another to say \"I won't go to my sister's wedding\".  One is a general rule that happens to affect certain people, the other is more personal. \n\nIf OP had a rule to never go to any weddings, I'd understand.", "The times when she was annoyed were in public.

Everything about your guest list is personal and who is a priority in your life. You invite the people who are important and you want to spend the most important, or at least most expensive, day of your life with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a difference between choosing not to invite your nieces and nephews and choosing not to invite your friends children or even your cousins' children. Most people don't expect to nor will have a close or lifelong relationship with their friends children. When you have a child free wedding you run the risk of friends not showing up because their children can't make it. You are saying that their children are not important to you. Most people aren't necessarily offended by this because they know that their children are not a priority. They may take offense that you would prefer they not show up than to show up with their kids though. I would rather not bring my kids to a friends wedding but sometimes life happens and you have to choose between bringing kids or not attending the wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKids however don't grow up in a vacuum and there is nuance. In this case (which is completely fake by the way) the sister hates children and has been actively excluding them from her life. These actions, outside of just the wedding itself, affect the entire family and their get togethers. If the kids are one or two they will never know that they were not invited or unwanted at the wedding. By the time they are 4, 5, or 6 they will understand that they don't have a relationship with their aunt but won't necessarily understand why. In a few more years they know perfectly well that their aunt simply dislikes them for who they are. They aren't going to turn 21 and magically like the aunt. At that point relationships have already been built or harmed and it was the choice of the adult. Yes, kids understand that they are not important to their aunt. It is going to be confusing and difficult for them because they are feeling unwanted and unloved by family which is what is actively happening here. When you choose to actively push away certain individuals in your family expect to have consequences for your actions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP is basing her actions around how her sister makes the rest of the family feel. Yes, she could be more honest with her sister which would be better but her sister called her selfish for wanting to watch her nieces and nephews.", "I don't think I explained particularly well but she's not, like, nice about it.

Like my mom is the youngest of 12 siblings, and all of them have kids.   \n\nAs a child, there were \"adults only\" events I didn't go to.  That didnt' make me dislike my aunts/uncles/cousins who got married any less.  It was just a thing, because I understood that some things were for adults and some were for kids AND adults. \n\nI think the kids start feeling left out when the parents make it a big thing.  If the parents constantly talk about Aunt Jennifer's wedding in front of a child, and how fun it will be, then sure, the kid will feel left out.

What in the world could motivate your sister to ever consider *dating* that guy, much less *marrying* him jfc", "this isn't about the children - its about the person she is marrying.  Tell her that even though you don't like her you would otherwise go to her wedding.\n\nTo marry a man like that , she must be very desperate to have a big day , to say 'i have a husband'.  Unfortunately her life would be better off if she was single, unburdened by a man.\n\nNTA", "Christ almighty, why is your sister marrying that guy???\n\nThe mind boggles...\n\nAnyhow, NTA. You never have to justify not going to a wedding. No is a complete sentence.\n\nGo play with your nieces/nephews for the day. They sound like much more fun!", "YTA. It\u2019s her wedding. Children can be obnoxious as hell and she\u2019s allowed to not want them there.\n\nI read your edit about what future BIL has done, but stuck with Y T A because nowhere do you mention that that\u2019s the reason, or that it is even a part of the reason, that you\u2019re skipping the wedding. You just mentioned it to state that your husband isn\u2019t attending.\n\nIf you\u2019d stated that as the reason for not going, instead of this whole \u201chalf the family is missing if the kids aren\u2019t there\u201d-nonsense, my judgement would be different.", "You're not the AH for not wanting to go to a wedding, but your sister is also not an AH for wanting her wedding to go exactly how she wants. It is her wedding and having no children is a very common and honestly understandable rule. Children do ruin events like that because they don't behave as well as an adult does (though does depend on the situation). I personally would have a completely children wedding too, and anyone who decided to still come with a young child would be turned down at the door and not let inside. I'd honestly say NAH", "NTA because in the end you\u2019re not going to the wedding because of the soon to be BIL.\n\nBut YTA for the title. Makes it sound like you\u2019re not gong because the wedding is childfree!", "Totally unrelated and probably inappropriate for this thread but I love your username lol. I knew someone that made their username a jamble of the words 'fart' and 'sniffer' haha", "I don't understand why people are so mad about child free weddings. Every wedding I've been to with kids has been massively interrupted by screaming kids during the ceremony. It isn't cool to inflict that on the couple and it's unrealistic to think kids can stay still that long. \n\nWeddings are freaking expensive so stop taking the couples decisions so personally. \n\nOP is kidding herself by pretending that during the year it takes to plan a wedding her sister couldn't find a freaking baby sitter. \n\nOP YTA. AND a crappy sister.", "I was trying to avoid swaying it, initally, but so many people were asking for the details about their issue. So I added it to the post. It was never my intention to sway the vote.", "If she doesn\u2019t want to go she doesn\u2019t have to go, even before edit it was obvious she doesn\u2019t like her sister and no one is obligated to go to the wedding of person they don\u2019t like, she just didn\u2019t want to be rude and came up with an excuse, but sister kept pressing and she got what she wanted - the truth.\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "How exactly are you sensing this \"contempt\" radiating? OP seems perfectly reasonable to me, her sister made a choice that made it difficult for her family to attend and OP offered to help her older sister. Reddit loves baseless conjecture.", "Yeah nah that edit, holy shit, the whole family should not attend on fucking principle", "\"How dare you, he's not that person anymore! Instead he goes with me to harass the orphanage workers for daring to keep chidren alive!\"", "I'm 100% with you on that comment!!\n\nOP ... the fact that no one seems to be able to confront this guy about his BS is just *FEEDING* his horrible behavior. Basically, he's the town bully who's marrying your entitled sister, and you/the rest of your family are the terrified villagers \ud83e\udee4\n\nI know it's hard to stand up to that kind of bully. I married one in 1977/left him in 1982. It took me and my family a DECADE after that of refusing him and calling the law on him every time he showed up causing problems to finally convince him that he really didn't want to ring any of our doorbells anymore. It took us all being on the same page/banding together to do it .... so we made sure everyone knew the truth of the story, and knew to run him off the second he showed up!\n\nSo I get how hard it is to deal with a bully (trust me, the best way is to be very public about their BS. Tell everyone about it, even if it doesn't make you look that great either) but this is the part I don't get:\n\nWhy is your youngest sister marrying this piece of filth. \n\nDid you and your husband not tell her about this AH's history? \n\nIf your SIL is so willing give you permission to share her story *here* with a ton of strangers who aren't involved in the slightest ... then why didn't you ask her for permission to share that story with your sister to keep her from dating and ultimately marrying this jackass? I don't care how annoying she was to me as a kid sister, I would have tried to let her know why this clown would be a terrible idea!!\n\nWhy didn't you?", "I have no strong feelings towards children, sometimes they're annoying, yes, so are adults. At least children have the excuse that their brains have yet to develop. What excuse do adults have?", "Does the sister who is marrying him know the whole story? Does she know that he celebrated the death of his infant son? Does she know that he tried to screw over his ex in all possible ways?", "This is what makes me question what the family dynamics are like. Is the sister an actual arsehole or is the sister the the scapegoat for the whole family's problems/OPs problems who just happens to be in a relationship with an abusive man who has lied and twisted his past.", "And to the OPs own future children; I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d trust this man around a plant.", "i like you", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fklj7/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_sisters_childfree/judtchf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3\n\nOP commented this awhile ago: I think this is probably why", "OPs Husband was just 15 and worked all hours to pay for his nephew\u2019s funeral! I can see why these despicable humans don\u2019t want to be confronted by children and memories thereof at their wedding. I find it hard to believe that anyone would attend when he stills shows not an iota of remorse for his behaviour.", "Yeah, sister getting married had to know it was a possibility someone would end up not able to go when she made a no kids rule to people with kids"]}
