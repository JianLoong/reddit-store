My two older sisters (32, 30) both have kids. My third sister (27) doesn't and is getting married at the end of the month. I (23) also don't have children but my partner & I hope to have some in the future. Oldest sister lives overseas with her husband and so is mostly irrelevant in this situation - her and sister 3 don't speak.\n\nAnyway, sister 3 is having a childfree wedding. She is, like, aggressively childfree. We don't really get along.\n\nSo, basically, our parents are old farts (lol love them) and can no longer drive. I can't drive, either, but my husband can, as can my older sister. She's a single mom, though, and had no one to watch her kids.\n\nMy husband & soon to be BIL hate each other. They grew up together and theres just lots of hard feelings there, so my husband wasn't going to the wedding. I was going to have him drop me off.\n\nIn the end, last weekend, after months of anxiety, I said I would stay with the kids so my parents and sister could go. She will drive them and attend in my place. Once we decided my husband gave the okay to work on the day of the wedding.\n\nMy sister lost it at that. Then decided she would have someone else drive our parents and asked me to come. I told her no, my older sister wants to go - I'd rather her there, anyway, as if one of our parens falls or something she knows what to do.\n\nSister lost it and said I was being selfish. This is where I may be the asshole;\n\nI then told her I didn't see the point in going to an event half the family would be missing from (referencing the kids). \n\nShe said it shouldn't matter to me, because I don't have kids. I then said they were better company than her & point blank refused to attend her wedding. Even if the kids have a babysitter, which sister is now offering to pay for, I wouldn't go.\n\nShe's so upset. I feel a little bad, but not much.\n\nMy oldest sister says I'm in the right, second sister says she feels really bad. Our parents aren't really acknowledging the situation. I think they just want to see their daughter get married.\n\nAITA?\n\nI can definitely see both sides of this and I'm conflicted. The more I think about it the closer I get to apologising and offering to go, even though I don't want to.\n\nETA; Everyone who was asking about the drama between my husband & BIL - here you go. I had to get permission from my SIL before I could share.\n\nMy SIL (husbands sister) and soon to be BIL (sisters almost husband) dated in high-school. He got her pregnant and dipped. He tried to force an abortion on her, accused her of cheating, the whole shebang. \n\nWhen she had the baby she had a DNA test done and sued him for child support. The entire time he was slating her name, making her feel horrible - tried to force her to put their son up for adoption. \n\nWhen their son was five months old he passed away due to an undetected medical issue. She was suffering, hospitalised. \n\nBIL made a post about being free from the shackles of his \"bank draining baby mama\" and went on a partying streak to celebrate. Insists that she's a bad mom, even now, and has never once visited his sons grave (and skipped his funeral). Didn't tell his own family members that he'd passed away and they also missed his funeral. \n\nMy husband fucking hates him. He ended up having to work overtime to help pay for the funeral as a fifteen year old because BIL refused to step up. He doesn't even acknowledge his son.\n\nMy SIL is still recovering, no thanks to him, but has welcomed a baby girl in the past year and she is an amazing mom. \n\nThe term \"bad blood\" is an understatement.", "created_utc": 1690914467, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fklj7/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_sisters_childfree/", "score": 2141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everything about your guest list is personal and who is a priority in your life.

Most people don't expect to nor will have a close or lifelong relationship with their friends children. When you have a child free wedding you run the risk of friends not showing up because their children can't make it. You are saying that their children are not important to you. Most people aren't necessarily offended by this because they know that their children are not a priority. They may take offense that you would prefer they not show up than to show up with their kids though. I would rather not bring my kids to a friends wedding but sometimes life happens and you have to choose between bringing kids or not attending the wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKids however don't grow up in a vacuum and there is nuance. In this case (which is completely fake by the way) the sister hates children and has been actively excluding them from her life. These actions, outside of just the wedding itself, affect the entire family and their get togethers. If the kids are one or two they will never know that they were not invited or unwanted at the wedding. By the time they are 4, 5, or 6 they will understand that they don't have a relationship with their aunt but won't necessarily understand why. In a few more years they know perfectly well that their aunt simply dislikes them for who they are. They aren't going to turn 21 and magically like the aunt. At that point relationships have already been built or harmed and it was the choice of the adult. Yes, kids understand that they are not important to their aunt. It is going to be confusing and difficult for them because they are feeling unwanted and unloved by family which is what is actively happening here. When you choose to actively push away certain individuals in your family expect to have consequences for your actions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP is basing her actions around how her sister makes the rest of the family feel. Yes, she could be more honest with her sister which would be better but her sister called her selfish for wanting to watch her nieces and nephews.", "I don't think I explained particularly well but she's not, like, nice about it.

Like my mom is the youngest of 12 siblings, and all of them have kids.   \n\nAs a child, there were \"adults only\" events I didn't go to.  That didnt' make me dislike my aunts/uncles/cousins who got married any less.  It was just a thing, because I understood that some things were for adults and some were for kids AND adults. \n\nI think the kids start feeling left out when the parents make it a big thing.

But given the update, clearly NTA except for ever considering attending this travesty of a wedding.", "Well devil\u2019s advocate she said she had to get permission from her sil to explain that (which is valid) I\u2019m thinking she used the child free thing for the excuse as it was something she could post but this is the main reason she\u2019s not going.", "She said she needed her SIL\u2019s permission to post the story. So she may have been trying to talk around it.", "Read the edit, that anger is NOT misplaced.", "I can understand that. You have to pretend in order to protect someone vulnerable, and you'd have to come up with SOMETHING to get out of going one way or another. TBH, in your position, I don't think I'd be able to look that man in the eye without my face letting on that I probably wouldn't brake if he suddenly stepped in front of my car. If you go, he'll probably figure out that you know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut geez, what was this post, then? Testing out excuses on a neutral audience to see which one you'll be able to get away with? If you need an excuse for missing the wedding, and she's steamrolled over your transportation and childcare excuses, just fabricate a medical emergency like the rest of us do. RSVP that you'll go, and then three hours before text everyone that you won't be able to make it, then go incommunicado for the rest of the night, maybe leave home and go stargazing or something. Later, say you felt a deep ache in your thigh, followed by a tearing pain, and you rushed to the ER for an ultrasound because WebMD told you those are the signs of a dislodged blood clot. I did that. (Actually had the symptoms, texted an MD I know, he told me to get to the ER IMMEDIATELY. It wasn't that, I was fine, still don't know what it was.) That ate up six hours of my evening and a huge chunk of cash, but the six hours are the important part.\n\nAs a bonus, you potentially wreck this monster's wedding as everyone is wondering what happened to you.\n\nAm I a petty and vile cretin? Yes, yes I am.", "Oh good lord. People. I hadn\u2019t seen that stuff while scrolling through. I personally felt husband was completely valid in not attending prior to hearing the backstory - nobody should be forced to go to an event if there\u2019s that much bad blood with one of the main people involved. Even as the bride I\u2019d prefer anyone to just pass on the wedding upfront like the husband did instead of going to my wedding and being that uncomfortable or unhappy. I\u2019m just shocked OP was so focused on the kid free part when there are multiple other much bigger reasons to not go.", "She does say that but doesn\u2019t attribute it to anything specific. It could even be about the possibility of her parents falling since she gives this as a reason for the sister to go in her place. \n\nThe title of the post is specifically about not going to the child free wedding despite not having children. She even mentions specifically not having them again in her post but that she wants them eventually, she calls her sister aggressively child free - the focus of the post is almost entirely about the child free aspect and a lot of her replies are focused on the child free aspect. It seems weird to not mention there being other reasons she didn\u2019t want to go if that was the case. I think she\u2019d at least have said that there were issues she couldn\u2019t discuss without the involved parties permission but her husband is valid in his hatred for the guy due to him doing awful shit when they were teens. Even without going into details there would probably have been more focus on not wanting to go because she agreed with her husband, or the fact that she didn\u2019t think he was a good person, etc. She probably would have at least said that the child free thing was just the polite reason she gave for not going in order to not blow up family drama before the wedding. You\u2019d think it\u2019d have been framed more like \u201cAITA for lying to my sister about why I don\u2019t want to go to her wedding\u201d if the child free thing was just a cover for the real reason. \n\nI think there are PLENTY of reasons for her to not attend and to keep these people at arm length. The BIL is a monster, and if she genuinely thinks her sister wouldn\u2019t care if she knew the details then her sister is a monster too.", "I think people are also missing the part where you said the 2 of you don\u2019t really get along.  If your older sisters get along it would make more sense for her to go and you watch her kids. \n\nAlso, not going supports your husband opinion of the future BIL which I think is very important to make that stance now and not later on.  BIL seems like he is a horrible human.", "Agree with you OP. I think weddings without kids kind of misses the point of it being a celebration with family.", "Exactly. She declined. The bride pushed the issue. Things escalated. Honestly, given the level of bad blood between the groom and OPs husband, the bride and groom should be thankful OP isn\u2019t attending.", "It made me want to cry just reading that her SIL's 5-month-old passed away and I don't even know any of these people. That guy is a monster. I wouldn't want him anywhere near me, my family, and definitely wouldn't go to the wedding and I'd flat out tell my sister why.", "I couldn\u2019t be gleeful that any person has died. It\u2019s clear future-bil never considered his son as a human being.", "I agree this very well could be happening here. I think those of us in the lgbtq community (or community adjacent) understand this concept a lot, because we understand the \"not my secret to tell\" world really well.", "Or she just made it up because she was getting a lot of Y TAs. This is a convenient little story that suddenly puts everyone back on her side.", "Not only post, it\u2019s probably the stated reason to the family\u2026 it\u2019s child free, I volunteered to watch the kids, it\u2019s too late to change. Tbf this is a reasonable explanation. It\u2019s child free so there is the possibility siblings with children may not attend. OP volunteered to sacrifice her attendance so others could.", "I read it that she was using the child free aspect to dip on the wedding without explicitly saying she didn\u2019t want to go. And threw \u201chalf the family missing \u201c referring to the kids as a dig about the dead infant, but I could be off", ">Testing out excuses on a neutral audience to see which one you'll be able to get away with? If you need an excuse for missing the wedding, and she's steamrolled over your transportation and childcare excuse\n\nThis is literally what she was doing and still doing", "I dunno, by now it's getting disjointed enough that it reminds me of ME when I'm in a tizzy and freaking out. It's getting into \"can't make this shit up\" territory.", "Wanna know why you suck? BIL is an absolute demon, who your husband is in all his right to hate, and if I was your husband or your husband's sister I could never stand you going to that wedding, it would feel like a massive betrayal. But no, you were completely willing to go to that monster's wedding, the only reason you're not going now is because you personally don't like childfree weddings. So you're both someone who turns a blind eye to the awful people in this world, and someone who feels entitled over the planning of someone else's wedding. Ridiculous.", "NTA. But you shouldn't be asking anybody else. If all this is true, you have more than a lifetime of reasons to go NC with your sister and her new husband.", "Sometimes it's a lot easier to use a \"minor\" excuse like \"sister 1 can go with mom and dad while i babysit the kids because she's able to help them in case of emergency and she can drive, while i can't.\" instead of explaining the long version of \"you actively terrorize families with kids in public spaces and your fianc\u00e9 celebrated the death of his 5 month old son.\"", "Yeah I just took it as she hates the groom, doesn't get along well with her sister, but loves her nieces/nephews so she could suck it up and enjoy spending time with them. Since they weren't going to be there, the negatives outweighed the positives and she opted out.", "It adds up perfectly fine, with her already stating that hubby had issues, and her detailing those issues in a few comments. I agree that info should been in the main post from the beginning", "It's not shameful to get a security guard in Walmart because some kids were crying? That's fucking embarrassing", "Complaining about kids in a Walmart or on a plane is over the top (and bragging about it).", "Ew. Cut them both loose.", "Yeah, the childfree wedding thing is kind of a red herring. Don't go to the wedding because the groom is a monster!", "I took it as the only fun part would be hanging out with her niblings but since they're not invited she doesn't want to since she doesn't really support the union.", "Sounds like they deserve each other if that\u2019s true. No way would I be going and faking a smile at a monsters wedding.", "OP hates her sister, yet spends an awful lot of time collecting over-the-top stories about her behavior. Are there that many security guards in Walmart (I've never been in one) where you can just summon one up for toddlers being toddlers? Is that even realistic? Is there no longer a difference between shameful and shaming someone? OP's stories about her sister are not believable to me.", "I was excluded from a wedding in my family because they wanted a \u201cchild free wedding\u201d. Care to guess what wing of the family has never even *met* my kids, decades later?\n\nDon\u2019t presume that being told they\u2019re not welcome is something kids couldn\u2019t possibly care about.", "Depends on the area. The one near me has a couple. But summoning a security guard to have children removed from a store (and Walmart at that, not Bloomingdales) is shaming the mother for not being able to quiet her children and embarrassing herself."]}
