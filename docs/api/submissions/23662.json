I can't drive, either, but my husband can, as can my older sister. She's a single mom, though, and had no one to watch her kids.\n\nMy husband & soon to be BIL hate each other. They grew up together and theres just lots of hard feelings there, so my husband wasn't going to the wedding. I was going to have him drop me off.\n\nIn the end, last weekend, after months of anxiety, I said I would stay with the kids so my parents and sister could go. She will drive them and attend in my place. Once we decided my husband gave the okay to work on the day of the wedding.\n\nMy sister lost it at that.

Half the family will be missing regardless.", "My BIL doesn't even know we know he's the father. My SIL doesn't want to deal with him and if we mention it he's going to show up on her doorstep acting all nasty, get back in her face. Its not something anyone wants to deal with.", "Being immature and celebrating your sons death are two seperate things.", "She should have just said that then.  I think that is where many people are coming from.  \n\nShe didn't want to go, but wouldn't just say that.  So she made up an excuse, that she was babysitting.  THen the sister was like \"I'll pay for a sister\", now there seems to be some other excuse", "I think most people would be pretty upset if, for no reason that they know of, their sibling just clearly tried to get out of going to their wedding. \n\nThis isn't like a birthday party or something.  Its a big life event.  ANd it sounds like the sister actually loves OP, even though the feeling may not be mutual", "Yeah I get it. Shit is always awkward when we see her though lol.\n\nAnd yeah I'm just like a normal guest.", "I agree 110%. A person invited can choose to go or not. But it\u2019s still to choose not to go to a wedding bc someone else can\u2019t bring kids lol. OP didn\u2019t want to go. Don\u2019t lie. Just don\u2019t go.", "Politely declining would not necessarily be an asshole move - though I do wonder why she hates her sister so much that showing up to her wedding is unthinkable. \n\nMaking up one fake reason on top of another and then telling the bride to be you don\u2019t like them is an asshole move.", "You don't need a reason.  But, when its a major life event for a sibling, you usually suck it up and go. \n\nI hate graduations.  I find them boring.  Ddin't even love going to my own. \n\nBut when my brother graduated, I made it a point to go and support him.  \n\nSo yes, she can choose to not go, and not give a reason.  But that will definitely cause a rift in their relationship.  And maybe she is ok with that. \n\nBut either way, she shouldn't be blaming the sister for it.", "No but she doesn\u2019t need to bash their choice to have a child free wedding! No is a complete sentence no reason needed.", "This is so reductive.\n\nIf you just \"don't want to go\" to a very special day in you siblings life, I think that makes you an asshole.", "Ok? The problem is that OP gave a reason, and that reason was a transparent lie.", "(Ignore this, I'm testing to see if me replying to this comment means it'll stick)", ">She got herself moved up to first class, for free, because she complained so much. And she's proud of it.\n\nHa.  I mean, I like kids.  But if she got a free upgrade AND got away from a crying child, I'm not going to hate on her for that.", "So you just hate her. What a family dynamic. People who love children often don't want to sit next to crying children in a nice restaurant, maybe because they paid for a sitter to have an adult dinner. It sounds like you two should just spend less time together.", ">I then told her I didn't see the point in going to an event half the family would be missing from (referencing the kids).\n\n\"Having a child free wedding is fine.\"\n\nYou said both these things.\n\nTherefore, liar.\n\nYTA.", "Maybe she just wanted you there more, and when she realized you weren't going, she tried to make it happen.  \n\nI'm not sure what your relationship is like, but it seems you are more than happy to attribute the worst possible motives to her.  But it is her wedding, and if you care about her, you should try to support her.", "That\u2019s bc her sisters kids aren\u2019t her problem why didn\u2019t you offer to pay for a sitter", "I did say I think they should go to the wedding, however the way they both communicate (as told by OP) doesn\u2019t seem very productive. I don\u2019t think immediately blowing it is ever the right response even if someone is saying they can\u2019t come to your wedding", "The same logic can apply to people who choose to exclude nieces and nephews from their weddings though. You are choosing to exclude family from an important life event and milestone. You are making it more difficult for your siblings to attend. Expect it to cause a rift in family relationships.", "There's a difference between being annoyed with children being loud in public and asking an actual security guard to remove children from a public space for being children.", "Oh yeah I get it. Sometimes a date night is not as fun because of crying kids. But you don't need to get all public and shamey about it.", "Its fine. It doesn't mean I want to go.", "Because sitters are fucking expensive lol. Why pay for a sitter when I can do it for free?\n\nIf our sister couldn't afford it, thats fine, but then how did she miraculously find the money when it was me missing the wedding instead of their mom?", "Why should OP have to pay for a sitter? She can choose to go or not, but she\u2019s not obligated to pay for one sister\u2019s childcare because of another sister\u2019s choice to have a child free event.", "I mean, one is just excluding people under a certain age, its not a personal thing.  I'm not trying to say my thoughts on child free weddings, but I do think its one thing to say \"no one under 21\" and another to say \"I won't go to my sister's wedding\".  One is a general rule that happens to affect certain people, the other is more personal. \n\nIf OP had a rule to never go to any weddings, I'd understand.", "The times when she was annoyed were in public. Where's the shaming? She didn't complain to the parents; she asked employees of the public places to accommodate her elsewhere. I hope you all grow up and get past your childhood hatreds, or stop seeing each other altogether.", "So you are a liar, got it.", "Cut her off if you hate her so much", "Bc she\u2019s saying it\u2019s other sisters responsibility", "Well, I disagree on your premise that it's not a personal thing. Everything about your guest list is personal and who is a priority in your life. You invite the people who are important and you want to spend the most important, or at least most expensive, day of your life with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a difference between choosing not to invite your nieces and nephews and choosing not to invite your friends children or even your cousins' children. Most people don't expect to nor will have a close or lifelong relationship with their friends children. When you have a child free wedding you run the risk of friends not showing up because their children can't make it. You are saying that their children are not important to you. Most people aren't necessarily offended by this because they know that their children are not a priority. They may take offense that you would prefer they not show up than to show up with their kids though. I would rather not bring my kids to a friends wedding but sometimes life happens and you have to choose between bringing kids or not attending the wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKids however don't grow up in a vacuum and there is nuance. In this case (which is completely fake by the way) the sister hates children and has been actively excluding them from her life. These actions, outside of just the wedding itself, affect the entire family and their get togethers. If the kids are one or two they will never know that they were not invited or unwanted at the wedding. By the time they are 4, 5, or 6 they will understand that they don't have a relationship with their aunt but won't necessarily understand why. In a few more years they know perfectly well that their aunt simply dislikes them for who they are. They aren't going to turn 21 and magically like the aunt. At that point relationships have already been built or harmed and it was the choice of the adult. Yes, kids understand that they are not important to their aunt. It is going to be confusing and difficult for them because they are feeling unwanted and unloved by family which is what is actively happening here. When you choose to actively push away certain individuals in your family expect to have consequences for your actions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP is basing her actions around how her sister makes the rest of the family feel. Yes, she could be more honest with her sister which would be better but her sister called her selfish for wanting to watch her nieces and nephews.", "I don't think I explained particularly well but she's not, like, nice about it. She is loud all, \"These children are out of control,\" aggressive point, \"And they shouldn't be allowed to disrupt the shopping experience of everyone else. I demand you remove them or I will report you to blah blah blah.\"\n\nShe's just a dick about it. When we were at our parents place, helping them out, she went next door and threatened to call the cops because the neighbour kids were being too loud and \"impacting\" our fathers healing. (The man is deaf as fuck he could barely hear them).", "Oh my god can you read?", "The whole old parents thing makes it difficult. They're in and out of hospital and I don't work so I'm usually the one running around hospitals and such. I see her a lot because of that.", "I\u2019m not following lol. At no point in this story are the children OP\u2019s financial responsibility.", "I find it so interesting when people say that kids will feel some type of way about not being invited to a wedding. \n\nI come from a HUGE family.  Like my mom is the youngest of 12 siblings, and all of them have kids.   \n\nAs a child, there were \"adults only\" events I didn't go to.  That didnt' make me dislike my aunts/uncles/cousins who got married any less.  It was just a thing, because I understood that some things were for adults and some were for kids AND adults. \n\nI think the kids start feeling left out when the parents make it a big thing.  If the parents constantly talk about Aunt Jennifer's wedding in front of a child, and how fun it will be, then sure, the kid will feel left out.  If its just a thing that is happening, the kids won't care unless they are given a reason to care.", "Yup. You told her: \"I didn't see the point in going to an event half the family would be missing from (referencing the kids).\"\n\nthat was a lie. Because you then said here: \"Having a child free wedding is fine.\"\n\nSo which is it? Either way, you're lying.", "Honestly I don\u2019t think YOU can read. You\u2019re a liar.", "Then you\u2019re screwed you should get some therapy and start acting like an aduly", "Op said that the bride should\u2019ve offered to pay for a sitter but the kids aren\u2019t the brides problem", "Yes. *I* do not see the point in going. To *me* a childfree wedding is pointless. That does not mean I believe they should never happen. They're fine. It just means I won't go to them.", "What is the lie?", "If the bride couldn't afford, thats fine. Its the fact that she \"couldn't afford it\" when our sister was the one missing the wedding, but now because its me missing it she can suddenly afford it.", "No they\u2019re not, but it\u2019s the bride\u2019s event. I don\u2019t think she should necessarily pay either, but I still don\u2019t see how it\u2019s in any way logical to expect OP to."]}
