{"id": 22865, "submission_id": "156cime", "title": "AITA because stricter rules apply to my son(14) than to his cousin(12)at a party?", "selftext": "Today is my parents' golden wedding anniversary. First there is church and then a party in a banquet hall for the rest of the day. My parents wanted a big, fancy family celebration and don't want any presents or anything like that, they just want to have their family around them in a nice setting. It wasn't easy to convince our son that a suit and tie must be worn by him that day, and of course he sulked and moaned, but in the end we were able to buy him a nice suit.\n\nI recently talked to my sister about the upcoming party and she told me that she had similar problems with my nephew, \"but he doesn't have to stay in his clothes for long anyway\". I asked her what she meant by that and she said my nephew can change into more comfortable clothes after church. I told her that I didn't like that because our parents wanted the family to wear nice clothes and they certainly didn't mean that the outfit was changed immediately after church, not even for a 12-year-old. We bought our son a suit with a waistcoat so he could still look smart without a jacket later at the party and told him that he had to wear his tie as long as his grandpa had his. It wasn't easy to explain that to him, but he grudgingly accepted it, and now when he sees his cousin in jeans and a t-shirt at the party while he's in collar and tie for the rest of the day, the moaning will surely start again.\n\nMy sister says it's my own fault and I'm way too strict with my rules, I see it differently. Once a year you can survive a day in a suit, even if you don't like wearing the clothes, even a teenager. Otherwise he has the best life and I don't think that's too much to ask.\n\nAITA if I continue to insist on my rules?", "created_utc": 1690008132, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156cime/aita_because_stricter_rules_apply_to_my_son14/", "score": 27, "replies": ["This post has been removed due to the status of the original poster's account.

It might settle the expectations", "YTA\n\nYour rules can only extend to your child. Your sisters rules apply to hers. One is not better than the other because\u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter! They\u2019re both children, it\u2019s not their day, they\u2019re not the focus after the group photo. Your son will survive in a suit and no one will bat an eye at her kids jeans\u2026 except for you for some reason. \n\nThat said, a suit and tie with a waistcoat on a teenager screams dated and stuffy.  Did you ask your son for his idea of formal wear? The younger generation is reinventing formal wear that isn\u2019t uncomfortable, and it\u2019s definitely not just jeans and tshirt.", "NAH You have your rules for your son and your sister has her rules for her son. It's not up to you to determine her rules nor vice versa. My parents had rules for me that my cousin's didn't need to abide by and my aunts and uncles respected that. \n\nI would offer some advice though, let your son at least have the option of taking off his jacket and loosening his tie at the actual party. That way he can still look nice, but he can feel a little more comfortable.", "You have your rules, and your sister has hers. It's okay to have different rules. Your son will complain, but that's the price of parenthood.", "I don\u2019t understand why some parents insist on making things harder or difficult for their kids ? Isn\u2019t the point of parenthood to do everything you can to encourage and nurture and not making them directly uncomfortable with no reason other than \u201cproper- ness\u201d or a superficial expectation? Yta. Your sister is correct. I understand kids need to suffer discomfort when there is a valuable lesson that will come out pf it (e.g persisting at school and finishing unless circumstances don\u2019t support that as in your child\u2019s best interests), but this does not seem to be such a time. Your son can learn to dress for a certain dress code when it\u2019s appropriate for him to consider that - e.g job interviews, etc.", "Need more info. How flexible are your parents when it comes to what the kids wear? Maybe they could be more flexible like your sister and make it a special rule so the kids don't stay too long in uncomfortable clothes? As important as this occasion is, it's also important to have two-way communication with your parents on what is possible and not possible for their special day. If they're really strict about the dress code, even for the kids, then your sister isn't respecting their wishes and could cause upset if her kid is the only one not dressed for the occasion the whole day. Her kid could essentially cause a visual 'clash' in a photo where everyone is formally dressed but her kid isn't. Advocate for your son and speak to your parents. If it's not possible, it's not possible, but at least you tried and you can explain your efforts to your son, who I'm sure would be more appreciative as opposed to turning up on the day, seeing his cousin swanning around in jeans and wondering why can't he do the same?", "NAH. Y\u2019all are separate parents parenting different children. I would check with grandparents to see what they want though. It\u2019s their event and if they are fine with the kids changing into more comfortable clothes at some point, there shouldn\u2019t be an issue.\n\nEdit: He might resent you later though if you continuously enforce rules he deems stupid on him though. I know I hold some resentment for my upbringing.", "NAH overall, because you have your rules and she has hers. Berating her over her choice was a bit uncalled for, but you were defending the rules set by your parents so I cant call you the AH here. Sister is inconsiderate, your son will eventually see why it was important to adhere to the dresscode if he even remembers it later in his life.", "Im not a fan of being dressed up, not as a kid neither as a adult.\n\nSo jeans and a nice shirt wouldn\u2019t be that bad.\nAlso, your parents want a nice happy family\u2026 you only get that if ppl are comfortable in their clothing especially kids.\n\nYou are not the AH but you can absolutely be less strict with stuff like this.", "Look, if the suit is the hull you want to die in, that\u2019s YOUR prerogative as a parent. The other parents and their kids choose to do it differently, and yeah, your son will feel some kinda way about it. Are you familiar with the expression, \u201cyour right to swing your fists ends at the other person\u2019s nose\u201d? Trying to have others change their rules to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d of your little world, YTA. Just understand that yeah, he\u2019s gonna see you as the asshole, but a teachable moment in here is that he can learn that people parent differently across the board, even in the same family. That or, as others suggested, figure out what the celebratory couple would like instead of making the suit such a BFD out of hand.", "NAH. To be frank, in this situation a 14 yo can no longer go by kid-rules, imo. He's now a teenager and as such more and more of 'grown-up rules' start applying to him. It's OK to expect a teenager to follow the dresscode for the duration of the whole party, and start teaching him about clothing side of manners (like when it's ok to do away with the coat and tie). \n\nA 12 yo can still be seen to be just a child, and not a teenager. As such, they can be given more slack when it comes to the dresscode. Following this logic, your teenager probably also has more freedom in their every day life than a 12 yo kid does. Growing up means both new responsibilities and freedoms hand in hand. Maybe your teen will understand it better if you explain it from this direction.", "YTA. Obviously, you are neither the rule maker nor the rule enforcer. Jump off your broom for the day and let your kid enjoy the wedding with the rest of his cousins. Do you REALLY want him to remember it as the time mom made me wear the suit?", "YTA. Honestly I think your sister picked the smarter way out but you do have every right to insist your kid wears his suit throughout. You don\u2019t have any right to tell your sister what she should do with her kid and that\u2019s why you\u2019re TA", "You are the asshole for trying to insist that anyone else change the way they parent their kids because of the way you want to parent your own kid. Other kids will always have different rules for their kids and that will make parenting your own kid more difficult, but that\u2019s life. NTA for insisting your kid dress the way you want him to dress.", "NTA, you\u2019re teaching your son to show respect and kindness to others on their big day. Your sister is teaching her son the opposite.", "YTA and I 1000% agree with your sister. Why are you being cruel to your child? \nYou can still look nice and smart in something that isn\u2019t a suit. A pair of dress pants and a button down top is nice and smart.", "YTA if you try to make decisions for your sister and her kid. Make the rules you feel are best for your own son, but let your sister do the same. Yep, your kid is going to complain more when he sees his cousin in jeans. That\u2019s a reality you\u2019re going to have to face if you believe the suit is crucial to the party.", "Your rules in regards to your son? Absolutely not the AH. You raise your child the way you want (unless it's actually causing harm). Your rules in regards to your nephew? 100% AH. You don't get to dictate what your nephew wears. It's not your business. Stay in your lane Bud!", "NTA. I would reply it\u2019s not about the suit but about doing as requested. If you want to do something and has requirements then you have to follow rules set out. I suppose at 14 he has less autonomy and may not want to, but that\u2019s life at that age. He may only end up counting the times he wears a suit during his life on one hand, it\u2019s not as popular now in life.", "NAH. Your rule isn\u2019t enough to make you an arde. It won\u2019t kill our kids to eat liver one day a year\u2014but I don\u2019t force mine too..You are making this anniversary a more negative experience than your sister\u2014why? What lesson are they learning being forced to endure clothes they don\u2019t want to wear? As sn adult I don\u2019t do that and I\u2019ve attended weddings, funerals, and meetings where tens of millions of dollars were on the line.", "NAH\n\nDifferent families different rules", "There are two ways to look at this.\n1. NTA for wanting your son wear a suit for a golden anniversary.\n2. YTA for insisting upon it as a rule, creating an apprehension rather than help him appreciate.\n\nCould you explain to your son, that a lot of young children actually like wearing suits. Explain to him with analogies and examples.  Like Batman , Iron man etc...\nShow that suit is cool for events. Appeal to his best side rather than saying... \"stay with tie as long as grandpa does\". That doesn't sit well.\nThe way you see it is Church, decorum etc... which is not wrong, however presenting it like we do it for others, that will cause an aversion. Try to make him think, he is doing it for 'himself' and that he is going to be so cool on pics..\nHe could practice being James bond etc...\n(As a last resort, only as a last resort, do reverse, force him into wearing jeans, like totally force him and say you want to return the suit.... he will listen)\n\nDon't make this about you, your sister or your rules... you are not ruling your son.\nIf he thinks it 'his' choice to be in suit, who cares about the cousin's sloppy clothes.... \n\nMake it about him... He will enjoy! \ud83d\ude0e\n\nSo yes YTA but also NTA.", "NTA. Explain to your son that your parents will appreciate the fact that he does actually honour their wishes and that his cousin doesn't. \n\nMaybe even share a little laugh with your son that his cousin looks 'off' during the party. Explain that a lot of guests will be talking about the fact that he's wearing jeans and they will think less of him behind his back.\n\nThank your son and say you're proud of him for 'being the bigger man'. Maybe give him something small that represents him being the bigger man, a small glass of champagne might make him feel real proud of himself in his nice suit.\n\nComplement how handsome and adult he looks in his suit and ask a couple other family members to do the same. 'you're becoming a real man', 'you're looking so grown up'.\n\nMake sure by the time you're done with the party he'll want to wear the suit again, and the cousin is gonna look like a spoiled child while your son is the responsible one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
