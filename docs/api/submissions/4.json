We tried to have a baby in our 20s, went through fertility treatments, and nothing worked. This pregnancy was a huge surprise and is a highrisk pregnancy. My wife is 20 weeks now. \n\nMy brother and SIL have 3 kids (aged 5 - 8). SIL was pregnant again this summer and had a miscarriage at 21 weeks. They were obviously devastated and we felt awful for them. \n\nMy SIL talks about her miscarriage a lot, which is understandable. But it has been making my wife really anxious so I first asked my brother if they (he and SIL) can just stop bringing the miscarriage up in front of my wife. He said sure, and stopped, but SIL didn't. So I asked her too, and she said that she will try. She didn't stop. \n\nYesterday they came to visit us with the kids to stay a couple of days for Halloween. At lunch, my SIL said to my wife \"20 weeks now huh, I remember feeling the baby at 20 weeks. Sadly we lost him at 21\" and my wife had a panic attack. We (wife and I) left the room, and I came back 30 minutes later and just lost it at my SIL, I told her to just for once shut the hell up about her miscarriage. \n\nI feel like an ass, really.

It's fine to talk about your past, and even to dwell on it and feel the sting, but that doesn't mean you get to try to make someone else feel that way", "NTA. \n\nI am not going with N A H because at some point, SIL needs to be able to read the room. You do not tell a pregnant woman \"oh this is right where I was when I had my miscarriage!\" because it is at best tone deaf and at worst, cruel. \n\nI do not have kids, but had a sister who had a later term miscarriage (a still born) at about 5 months pregnant. It was awful. When I have pregnant friends, I do not share that story. I had two friends who talked about some similar symptoms of what happened with my sister, but they aren't very specific, one being a lower back pain. Both times, I told my friends \"take back pain seriously and call your doctor\" not \"my sister had a similar pain and her baby died\" because that's not helpful at all. \n\nYour SIL has had time to process, and isn't just sharing her sadness, but making your wife's pregnancy about her loss, which is totally inappropriate. Sure, your delivery could have been softer, but at that time your SIL had deliberately told your wife she lost her baby at this same stage, setting your wife fully in a panic.", "NTA. Your SIL is allowed to grieve her loss, but not at the expense of your wife's sanity. Your wife waited a long time for this baby and deserves to enjoy every moment of the pregnancy. Surely there other people in her life your SIL can share her thoughts with. It's not fair that your brother and his wife lost their baby, but it's also not fair for her to cause your wife extra stress and anxiety during her pregnancy. I hope you can figure out a way to tactfully get your SIL to stop discussing such a distressing topic with your wife. Congratulations on your surprise pregnancy. I hope all goes well.", "[removed]", "NTA - I understand that having a miscarriage is devastating (been there) and you do need to talk about it, but your SIL seems to be making unnecessarily unsettling and sensationalist statements to your wife.\n\nThe tone of what she\u2019s saying almost seems deliberate.", "NTA. Lost a baby at 18 weeks and would never dream of acting like this. She should be more sensitive to your wife not less.", "NTA OP, I wish I could understand just how devastating a miscarriage can be for women, but I can only imagine given that I'm a man and even then, I wouldn't come close. That being said, I've got more than enough common sense and respect for others to do what they ask of me and not bring up a personal tragedy so often, especially in front of someone who is in the exact same boat as I was when that personal tragedy happened to me. OP, your SIL is either incredibly selfish trying to make everything about her and her tragedy, or she's incredibly oblivious and doesn't have an ounce of common sense or ability to read the room. You asked her point blank could she stop mentioning her miscarriage around your wife and she said yes she would try (WTF). She knew your wife was pregnant, she knows how easy that stress can cause some pregnancies to miscarry, and despite knowing all of this she chose to talk about her miscarriage in such a descript and detailed fashion that it caused your wife to have a PANIC ATTACK for fuck's sakes!\n\n\"20 weeks now huh, I remember feeling the baby at 20 weeks. Sadly, we lost him at 21.\" Great, so now your wife is going to be panicking for the next 7 days about losing her baby all because your oblivious/selfish SIL couldn't keep her damn mouth shut. OP, your SIL caused your wife to have a panic attack and will probably cause her to have even more stress related episodes in the future during this pregnancy. For the sake of the health of your wife and your unborn child, please cut your SIL and your brother out of you and your wife's lives until a few months after your wife has given birth and adjusted to being a new mother.", "NTA\n\nSIL has the right to mourn her lost baby, but she also has the duty to respect your wife and your desire to avoid such a grim subject, especially because it hurts your wife.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nI understand why your wife is so upset and why hearing that sent her into a panic attack. I had a high risk pregnancy for my second, after multiple miscarriages, so get it. It is not an easy time at all. Your SIL shouldn't say things like that to her, as I'm assuming she full well knows the history and that it's a high risk pregnancy so should know better.\r  \n\r  \n21 weeks though...phew. That's not a miscarriage but your SIL giving birth to a dead baby that can't survive even in the NICU. Most people have a funeral for babies that die in utero at this stage and onward. It's only been a scant few months, seeing your wife at the same stage of pregnancy must be a huge trigger for her. Maybe a little distance is needed right now.", "It's like she is secretly wishing for your wife to have a miscarriage too", "NTA...if your SIL knows the pain of losing a baby,  she should be able to understand the fear this would put on your wife.  Best of luck.", "NTA\nSounds like SIL is doing it on purpose to upset your wife. Everyone knows you don\u2019t talk to pregnant women about your poor pregnancy experiences u less they are okay with it. \n\nMy best friend is pregnant right now. I just had a miscarriage. I told her Hera happened but we aren\u2019t talking about it because I don\u2019t want to stress her out and I can grieve my loss in other ways.", "No you are NTA. You made the original request and it was ignored. You are in a high risk pregnancy and your wife was in the middle of a panic attack of course you lost the plot. What she was saying to your wife was absolutely outrageous. You are not an ass in any way, I think the way you are looking out for your wife is lovely.", "I had a stillbirth and it was (and still is) totally devastating. I don't talk about it to pregnant women because they have enough stress unless 1. They ask or 2. They mention a doctor not taking them seriously and say that maybe the doctor knows better than they do (my loss could have been prevented if the doctor had run the test I'd asked for but he thought it wasn't necessary, so it wasn't run)\n\nYou are NTA and you need to avoid your SIL right now. If she asks why tell her honestly that she's putting your baby at risk because constantly raising your wife's blood pressure is seriously not good for either of them. I'd even go do far as to have your wife block her on her phone and social media, and have any contact go through you (with your wife's consent of course, but given how much stress this is causing this might come as a relief if you suggest it)", "Definitely NTA. I would  not spend any more time with her until the baby is born.", "I'd probably swerve hanging with your brother and SIL until your wife gives birth. Explain why to your brother, if everyone's an adult, nobody's gonna lose any sleep about a few weeks distance to preserve your wife's mental health.\n\nGood luck. Oh, and, NTA.", "NTA \n\nI do understand that a miscarrige is a traumatic thing, but it doesn\u00b4t feel like the SIL is  talking about it because she is sad, it feels like she is talking about it just to be the center of attention or because she is jealous of your wife because she is preagnent and want to make her feel bad", "NTA. She caused your wife to have a panic attack. You understand she is going through a loss and you respect that. You have only asked her to stop talking about this to or in front of your wife due to the stress it causes her and she refused to do that. That\u2019s on her. I would kick them both out and tell them not to come back till they are prepared to be decent people.", "As someone who has had a miscarriage NTA that is so fucking insensitive of your SIL and there\u2019s no way she said that without knowing how upset that would make your wife. Yes it\u2019s sad she lost her baby- but she doesn\u2019t need to talk about it constantly near a woman having a high risk pregnancy. I would flat out refuse to be around SIL until baby is here to ease your wife\u2019s mind.\n\nAlso- something you can tell your wife to help keep her calm, is a lot of places consider 24 weeks to be viability week. This means at 24 weeks or later if baby needs to be delivered, doctors will do everything in their power to help your baby and a good chance they will survive (granted some NICU time) I always looked forward to\nViability week with my babes! Wishing you two a peaceful remainder of her pregnancy!", "NTA. Your SIL's loss is tragic and I definitely don't expect her to be over it yet. She's probably experiencing a crazy amount of emotions still and being around another pregnancy is probably triggering. But she doesn't need to ruin your wife's pregnancy and give her so much anxiety. I say this as someone who has experienced multiple miscarriages, SIL is very much in the wrong and she needs help. I would stop seeing her for while so that you and your wife don't have to be subjected to your SIL's grief and so your SIL has time to heal and hopefully get some therapy.", "NTA and please go NC with SIL for the duration of the pregnancy.", "NTA. \n\nYour SIL knows first hand just how devastating a miscarriage can be, so she also should know just how extremely anxiety inducing her bringing up her miscarriage over and over again is to a woman with a rare pregnancy that's not likely to ever happen again.", "NTA, but sadly you may need to distance yourself and your wife from your brother and his wife for awhile.", "NTA\n\nY W B T A if you keep letting these people in your house.  You have asked her numerous times not to speak about her miscarriage around your high risk pregnancy wife.  SIL is not source of happy thoughts and positive vibes, there is no reason for her to be around your wife right now.", "NTA \n\nYour SIL is a self centered asshole. Don\u2019t apologize, just stay away from her until after your baby is born.", "NTA: Your SIL is a narcissist and needs to make everything about her.", "INFO: \n\nDid she apologise?", "NTA I\u2019ve had a miscarriage and it\u2019s awful. If talking about it helps her than more power to her. However, constantly bringing it up around someone who is pregnant is not helping her it\u2019s being cruel and jealous. She needs therapy. You and your wife are totally in the right here and it might be best to distance yourself from them for awhile. She\u2019s in pain but that doesn\u2019t give her the right to cause problems and trauma for you and your wife.", "NTA.\n\nI can't imagine what kind of grief they're in and of course they should be able to talk about it.  I can imagine it being particulary hard being around another pregnant family member still,  read the room.  That was an extremely bad time to bring it up", "That was so awful I pictured Tony Soprano\u2019s mom saying it. NTA. Time for some distance.", "NTA ! I had a late term miscarriage a few years ago (I\u2019ve since been blessed with a gorgeous healthy baby) so I understand the devastation especially considering you have to \u201cbirth\u201d your baby when it\u2019s a late term miscarriage \u2026 that been said I would never in my wildest dreams say anything about a miscarriage to any pregnant woman let alone a woman with a high risk pregnancy purely because I know the anxiety it would cause . I\u2019m trying to understand why you SIL would say that and I\u2019m coming up empty \u2026 I am truest sorry for her loss, the pain is honestly indescribable, however that doesn\u2019t give anyone the right to callous/insensitive .", "NTA!  Your SIL should have known better than to bring this up to you and your wife at this time!  My God, what were they thinking!??\n\nMy nephew and his wife recently had a beautiful baby girl after years of failed fertility treatments, which is a great joy to them.  Her pregnancy was also one that we all held our breath and prayed nightly for.  Thankfully, a wonderful outcome.  During that time, a long time family friend lost her daughter during childbirth, during to rare complications following a c-section delivery.  The baby survived, and looks so much like his mother.  We went out of our way to not discuss this sad situation in front of my nephew and his wife.  To bring any anxiety to them, when one case had nothing to do with the other, would have been so wrong.\n\nYour SIL has many reasons to feel sorrow, but she also needs to understand that visiting that upon expectant parents is a selfish and thoughtless thing to do.  You had every right to tell her to shut up and keep her thoughts to herself!  \n\nSending my best wishes and most positive thoughts for a joyous arrival of your new baby!!  My nephew had pretty much given up, as well.  They had one last embryo to implant from their previous IVF efforts.  If this didn't take, they were going to the next stage of adoption (they still are planning that).  But this little embryo was tough!  She implanted herself and refused to let go!  She was born in September and was absolutely perfect!  God Bless your growing family!  Enjoy every moment!  XO", "NTA, your SIL clearly hasn't processed a lot of her feelings on the miscarriage and I'm sure seeing another pregnancy is very tough on her. That doesn't give her the right to pass those feelings onto others, you asked both of them politely the first time as it was affecting your wife, its unfair of her to continue doing this when she knows the effect it has.", "NTA\n\nIt's like constantly reminding someone ill that you had a loved one die from the same illness. Nothing can excuse that.", "You are NTA. Your SIL sounds like someone who's intent is to make your wife anxious. Don't allow her to be around for the rest of the pregnancy. She doesn't have your wife's best interests at heart in the least.", "NTA \n\nMy SIL had a miscarriage while my pregnancy went on strong. We got pregnant at the same time. \n\nNeither of us talked about the pregnancies to each other. It\u2019s just insensitive. \n\n11 years later and she has a healthy relationship with my kiddo and she went on to have a rainbow baby but like. It was just common sense to be sensitive to the other? I didn\u2019t brag or boast or really talk about my pregnancy when she was round and she didn\u2019t talk about how stressful it was and heartbreaking to have a miscarriage. We both knew what the other needed and tried our best to be mindful.", "NTA\n\nWhile I understand your sister-in-law is grieving, and I hope she is receiving therapy and perhaps even on medication to help with it, she literally does not care how it's affecting your wife.\n\nHonestly, if she can't stop talking about it, and is getting professional help, I would keep your distance from even having her around. After all, when your wife gives birth, it will set your sister-in-law off even worse.", "NTA. It's rough they had to go through that, it must be hard for her to see your wife pregnant. That doesn't make it okay she is stressing your wife out. Could you say it any other way? Yes. But did that work? No. Maybe this wakes her up for what she is doing to you two.", "NTA. About 6 weeks ago I suffered a late term miscarriage. While normally I'd say it's really important for her to talk about it (it is) she needs to fall about it with the right people.  Your and your high risk pregnant wife are not the right people.  Just go NC with them until after your baby is born.  Your wife did not need the negativity and stress and suggest your sil get some proper help.", "NTA \n\nShe is very self absorbed not to realize what she is suggesting to your wife. It seems like intentionally making her anxious and making it difficult for her to be excited for your child.", "NTA.  I don't know what this is, your SIL's behavior, but some people can only view the world with themselves at the center.  Her behavior is very unempathetic at best and purposely hurtful at worst.\n\nHer \"trying\" to not talk about miscarriages is not a difficult thing to do.  She just doesn't care to stop her behavior.  Some people also have a black cloud hanging over them constantly and their misery is how they interact with the world.  People like that are exhausting to be around.", "NTA\n\nYou set a boundary with kind words, she broke them intentionally. Cut her off till the baby is born.", "Info: when you say this summer do you mean the summer that ended last month? Roughly 40 days ago?", "NTA. Throughout my pregnancy my coworker talked nonstop about her miscarriages. She had multiple, and also multiple children (4).\n\nIt was awful and by the end of it I hated her guts. It was a coworker so I changed jobs and never had to speak to her again, but in theory your wife and SIL will have an ongoing relationship. \n\nYour SIL probably doesn\u2019t realize this but you did her a kindness to try to preserve her relationship with your wife. I feel for her but she needs to shut up.", "NTA. It is not that hard to just avoid the topic. I would go for LC for the rest of the term.", "NTA\n\nIt is highly inappropriate for your SIL to bring it up in the current situation. In the same way you wouldn't brag about a pregnancy in front of a friend struggling with infertility. Read the room ffs.", "NTA.\n\nMiscarriages are terrible and tragic. But tragic things happen, and if someone is struggling they need to get support to help them manage\u2026You can have empathy for someone who\u2019s going through something without letting them act out and cause distress to others.", "You're a husband your wife's health comes first. Get SIL out of the house. Tell them they aren't to call, message  or see your wife until the baby is born. Stress and worry are horrible for pregnancies.  \n\nPlus those reminders are dick moves. It seems deliberate for some reason.", "NTA! I was prepared to rule you the AH but this is understandable. I talk a lot about my pregnancy loss. It\u2019s very therapeutic. But holy fuck what your SIL said was super insensitive. I would recommend cutting or limiting contact at least until the pregnancy has concluded.", "NTA. \n\nYour wife\u2019s pregnancy is already high risk. SIL doesn\u2019t need to come and add more stress to your wife telling her about her miscarriage all the time and stressing her out. \n\nSIL needs to learn to stop talking about it or stay away til the baby\u2019s born", "NTA - this is causing your wife way too much stress. You\u2019ve approached this politely and appropriately. Your SIL needs to work through this with her therapist.", "NTA\n\nSIL is cruel.", "NTA.\n\nYou asked kindly and at this point she is stressing our your wife badly enough it could cause a problem. Panic attacks are no joke.", "NTA. \n\nI don't understand the other judgements. Wtf? What kind of asshole would tell a currently 20 week pregnant woman such a thing? \n\nI don't care your SIL is grieving. She's an asshole and grief isn't an excuse. She should go to therapy if she's having a hard time with it. \n\nYou asked. More than once. She caused a panic attack to your wife\n\nI wonder if the everyone's the ahole would still say so if that was cause of stress enough to cause wife a miscarriage?\n\nThe way I see it your SIL seems to be wishing ill on your baby. I understand everyone grieves their own way but this isn't an excuse to be a monster. If you cannot handle social, as someone suggested, don't be social. \n\nSometimes we also need to think if our negativity is actually good for others. She made the choice to say stuff like that. She basically said to your wife \"oh even if you can feel him kicking now it could still die next week. That happened to me.\" \n\nI know plenty of grieving mothers who have had miscarriages and so forth but have never actually been such assholes to others. Especially not to a pregnant high risk woman. \n\nKick them out and tell them that their efforts aren't currently enough and you and your wife need positivity at the moment and support? Not negativity and ill wishes.\n\nDefinitely suggest your SIL to go to therapy as she's clearly going through something. \n\nBut do not excuse her behaviour as \"grief\" because there's no excuse for panicking a pregnant woman especially when I assume she knows how hard it was for you guys to get pregnant and that it's high risk. She needs to be the centre of attention and that is actually sickly to think of.\n\nYou can phrase it as \"I'm sorry but I am going to have to ask you to leave. Wife is very distress due to the fact you keep bringing up your miscarriage after we have tried to be nice and ask you not to. She needs to be relaxed and have positive vibes around as she is high risk and could have issues if too stressed.\" \n\nRegardless of all, your reaction was expected. I assume you're just as worried as your wife about the pregnancy and sometimes people forget that even if it's the woman growing the bun, the men also goes through most feelings. Except they don't always feel like they can voice them as they get diminished. \n\nThis is what a disgusting society we became. We excuse the woman but not the man. \n\nThe husband went through the same miscarriage. He managed to keep his mouth shut. He is clearly hurt too but way more respectful than his wife.", "No, no you are not. That is utterly ghoulish attention seeking from your sister in law. NTA.", "NTA. Jesus it\u2019s just common sense and decency to not constantly remind the pregnant woman that she could miscarry.", "NTA but you need to limit your time with her. Do not invite her over and don't go out of your way to talk to her. I understand that she is sad and she is grieving. But if she is still struggling that much, she needs to go to a therapist. It's one thing to bring it up a little here and there. But what she said to your wife was inexcusable. She knows exactly what she is saying. Grief isn't an excuse anymore. It sounds to me like she is intentionally trying to cause stress to you and your wife now.", "NTA, but SIL might not be able to stop herself because she's grieving and people grieve differently.\n\nI fully agree that she needs to stop talking about it with your wife because it is upsetting her.  If SIL can't stop some boundaries need to be set to keep her away from your wife. \n\nYou should speak again with your brother and set the boundaries and honestly recommend SIL seek some grief counselling.", "NTA. This is about emotional space. Sometimes a friend goes through something really horrible and you don\u2019t have the emotional bandwidth to help them all the time. That is okay. If you call up a friend to complain about your father and they say \u201coh my father died 10 years ago, I\u2019d love to have another argument with him,\u201d it\u2019s insensitive. Even though the loss of the parent is objectively worse than an argument with a parent, you clearly weren\u2019t in a place where you had the emotional bandwidth to have that conversation and they are stepping on your needs in favor of their own. \n\nAll relationships call for some level of balancing emotional bandwidth at times. When your friend is going through a breakup you don\u2019t talk about how much you miss being single and think he/she is super lucky they get to flirt with new people. When your friend is stressed about a test, you don\u2019t take the moment to talk about failing out of college. You recognize the emotional availability of the person you care about in any given interaction or relationship. SIL is not recognizing the emotional bandwidth of your wife right now. She doesn\u2019t have the emotional space and it\u2019s a conversation she can\u2019t take on at the moment. She clearly did have the conversation(s) when the event happened and in the past, but while she\u2019s pregnant, the bandwidth isn\u2019t there. She\u2019s already worried about her own pregnancy too much.\n\nSIL is being insensitive and not respecting emotional space and boundaries. It\u2019s out of line. While I would normally say yelling isn\u2019t the way to handle these things, in this case you did try to have a private, civil, and sensitive conversation. SIL was not unaware.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu need to go no contact with your SIL to protect your wife - STOP letting SIL abuse your wife.", "NTA. Good on you for standing up for your wife and creating boundaries. I would suggest you keep yourself and your wife away from your brother and SIL. She won't stop her bullshit so it's best to stay away.", "NTA. It sucks that SIL is clearly still traumatized by this but she's selfishly stressing out YOUR wife which could lead to the exact same thing happening! She needs therapy.", "NTA - We all understand she is grieving, which is probably made worse because your wife hit the same mark and is able to continue her pregnancy... a whole lot of \"life isn't fair vibes.\" However, your wife is pregnant and stress isn't going to help her through the rest of the pregnancy. Your wife is not her therapist.", "Nta your sil is being needlessly cruel. She can commiserate with her other family members. Hope your wife carries to term and delivers safely.", "NTA. But set a simple boundary. If she keeps talking about the miscarriage which is causing your wife considerable anxiety, she will be kicked out of your home, be put on no contact until they baby is born and will be excluded from everything until after the baby is born. I know it is extreme but experience has shown me, this may be the only way.", "NTA. Your SIL needs to have therapy to heal from her own trauma, not pass her own trauma on to your high-risk wife.", "NTA\n\nSIL had a traumatic loss, but that does not excuse saying such things to your wife. I cannot imagine, even in grief saying that to my sisters-in-law at the same stage. She needs to be in therapy for this. You and your pregnant wife are not the people to talk to here. She\u2019s trauma dumping on your joy and it needs to stop. Now, maybe this wakes her up to how awful that comment was, or maybe she doubles down. Either way, I\u2019d go NC until after your baby is born to protect your wife from her. It may seem harsh, but as this shows, it only takes one thoughtless comment to cause a huge problem. High risk pregnancies are nothing to take lightly and your wife needs to be protected from things like this. \n\nIf you can get through it calmly, apologise for yelling, but be firm that her comments are NOT welcome and maintain your distance until the baby arrives.", "Isnt it time they stopped visiting? Wait until after the birth to see them. Dont do xmas with them. Your SIL isnt appropriate to have round anymore during the pregnancy.", "When I saw the title, I was ALL KINDS going to go off on you. I've been through that hell. It's traumatic, horrific and a woman's worst nightmare. That, however, does NOT give the mourner a free pass to traumatize others.

Absolutely NTA! \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA\n\nIt's just not ok to do that.", "This is one of those situations where you need to go no or low contact for both of their sakes.

Please keep her away from your wife.", "NTA, you did all of the right things, they both agreed that it would stop, she kept going, and it was understandable that you finally lost it. People are allowed to talk about their losses up to the point where it begins to make people like you and your wife uncomfortable. It's like repeatedly telling your newly engaged friend all about how happy your marriage was until it ended in a horrible way, many times after they ask you to stop.", "NTA. That is not ok. Especially with the time comparison. She needs compassion- and to be empathetic.", "NTA. Your SIL should have basic social skills. That means NOT talking to pregnant women about your miscarriages unless explicitly asked. Grief does not exuse assholery.", "NTA.  Sounds like she might need to go home if she can't control herself in front of your wife.", "NTA...geeze, who says that to a pregnant person? \"Oh 20 weeks...I remember that time, and then mine was DEAD a week later\". Like wtf. Especially after you asked nicely. I realize the SIL had a highly traumatic experience, but she is causing one for your wife. If she can't respect that, then she needs to not be around your wife until after your baby is born.", "NTA. To me it seems she's doing it on purpose.", "NTA. Sil is selfish and honestly a btch for thinking it\u2019s even okay to bring this up to a pregnant woman going through a high risk pregnancy. There isn\u2019t much you could say in this situation that would make you an asshole tbh", "NTA at all.. SIL is a looking for pity from anyone that will give it. She needs to stfu about it. Grieving is a process but bringing it up every time is a not grieving. \nCongratulations by he way. I hope everything goes well for you and your family.", "NTA- kick them out.

They were obviously devastated and we felt awful for them. \n\nMy SIL talks about her miscarriage a lot, which is understandable. But it has been making my wife really anxious so I first asked my brother if they (he and SIL) can just stop bringing the miscarriage up in front of my wife. He said sure, and stopped, but SIL didn't. So I asked her too, and she said that she will try. She didn't stop. \n\nYesterday they came to visit us with the kids to stay a couple of days for Halloween. At lunch, my SIL said to my wife \"20 weeks now huh, I remember feeling the baby at 20 weeks. Sadly we lost him at 21\" and my wife had a panic attack. We (wife and I) left the room, and I came back 30 minutes later and just lost it at my SIL, I told her to just for once shut the hell up about her miscarriage. \n\nI feel like an ass, really.

If she actually is *completely out of her mind* to that degree, then BIL is the asshole for not getting her into some sort of inpatient program until she comes to her senses.\n\nOr, maybe. Just maybe. SIL *is* in fact, capable of recognizing that even though she is going through something terrible, she is not the only person on the entire planet with feelings, and actively *wishing* her pain on other people in some twisted attempt to make herself feel better is completely unacceptable.", "Yeah I am 100% on the side of the only mature thing to do is to stay away from SIL and give her space for her grief until you are ready to contend with that. Blowing up at her was just plain evil.", "Misery loves company", "I know women like this. So my brain also went there. It sounds like jealousy", "My brain went here too.\n\nSIL knows its a high risk pregnancy. She has been asked to stop.\n\nShe continues to try to stress the pregnant wife so she also has a miscarriage so they can be miscarriage friends \n\nI don't think it's a deliberate thought. I think it's subconscious. I don't think sil is a monster. I think she needs lots of therapy. I think it's fair to go NC for your wife until after delivery or therapy takes root \n\nI go nta, because her actions are so much worse than you yelling at her. But, thiugh your response was understandable, it was a bit over the top. She is also in pain. However. She caused you and your wife stress and pain that could go badly. So, I guess justifiable asshole.", "That was my takeaway too. There\u2019s no way this is unintentional. I feel for people who have miscarriages in really do but anyone with a semi-functioning brain knows you don\u2019t discuss miscarriages with someone who is expecting. That\u2019s like talking about a plane crash to someone as you take them to the airport.\n\nYou have your painful life experiences and you are more than entitled to feel everything you feel for them but constantly bringing this up to an expectant mother is just cruel, vicious and repulsive and really takes away a lot of empathy id normally feel for someone who experienced this.\n\nOne or two slip ups is understandable- it\u2019s a big thing and  in general talking about it is healthy and can be cathartic\u2026but seriously choose your audience.\n\nNTA- and honestly I\u2019d flat out ban her from your home/events until your baby arrives. She\u2019s not worth the drama and your wife does not need this.\n\nI understand this would be difficult especially with the holidays coming up but she\u2019s made it pretty obvious she\u2019s either too oblivious (which I seriously doubt), just doesn\u2019t care or is actively trying to push your wife to experience this for herself.\n\nHer reason doesn\u2019t matter - she\u2019s proven you can\u2019t trust her around your wife during the pregnancy.\n\nThere will be people who say you\u2019re overreacting, will say you\u2019re causing trouble or whatever but that is irrelevant.\n\nYour focus is on your wife and your child- none of the rest matters right now and SIL and the rest need to understand that.\n\nIf you can get time to talk to SIL and can manage it without losing your temper (I couldn\u2019t) talk to her and ask her how she would have fleet during her pregnancy if someone kept talking about miscarriages. Tell her you know she\u2019s been through a lot and you care and you want to help anyway you can but right now you are doing everything you can to keep your wife from having to experience the same loss she did. Tell her you know she\u2019s not doing it intentionally but her constantly bringing this up with your wife could end up stressing her out enough to where this happens.\n\nWhatever you do you are most definitely NTA. \n\nGood luck op", "That was my thought also, because misery loves company. And I know women who done that sort of thing to other people.", "Even though she already has 2 healthy children knowing their struggles and her high risk pregnancy. Yikes", "My thought exactly. It may not be an intentional thing, but at least a little underlying bitterness.", "You might be right. Some people do that kind of thing and it\u2019s so awful! Misery often loves company.", "My brain went to a similar place. I think she's doing it to be unintentionally spiteful at this point. She enjoyed the attention she got from being pregnant, then when she had a miscarriage she got attention from that as well. I could be wrong, and I hope I am, it just seems that she's a bit jealous of OP's wife being pregnant.", "I've been attending baby showers for decades now, and the desire of moms to frighten pregnant women with horror stories never ceases to amaze me.  It is as if once the woman is unable to back out of the pregnancy, it is time to treat her to all the stuff they don't tell you about in parenting books.  It is honestly terrifying.", "This is exactly what I was thinking.  It's sick because there are people out there who really hope for things like this, because they aren't dealing with their grief.  Sounds like SIL needs therapy.", "This is exactly what I was thinking.", "Well, it sounds like OP and wife already suffered through infertility and had issues so they are probably aware. The SIL sounds like one of those women who always has to push her experiences as being the most important", "So sorry for the loss of your dad. I lost my mom a few years ago and I still talk about her so much. I also understand that my brother and especially SIL talk about the baby they lost. I am here for it, I am the shoulder to cry on when they need one. But my wife and baby just need to come first now.", "I don\u2019t think it would be a harder call. Pregnancy is stressful, every single day of it. OP s wife doesn\u2019t need any reminder of that from anyone. She shouldn\u2019t have to ask people to stop talking about it constantly to her, it\u2019s a given. \n\nMiscarriage is a horrible thing to experience, and it should be more talked about, but pick your audience. Out of consideration, use someone else in your village. \n\nWill the OP and wife be allowed from 21 weeks to talk about their viable pregnancy to the SIL, or will they be expected to keep it to themselves when she\u2019s around to spare her feelings?", "I feel the same way about my mom. She died when I was 14 and I think about and talk about her a lot.", "Yes. For every one truly malicious person, there's a couple dozen people that just don't think before they talk.", "I refuse to believe this. No one is this clueless. There is NO WAY this started and ended in cluelessness. Especially when being reminded MULTIPLE times the topic is hurtful and stressful. This is intentional.

How dispicably cruel, maybe even downright sadistic. This kind of behavior all but screams that she's resentful and wants to hurt OP's wife.\n\nDefinitely NTA. I would even argue that your delivery wasnt even a*hole-ish. You addressed this with her two times previously nicely. Sometimes nice doesn't work.", "This was my thought. Not to dismiss the pain of a miscarriage but SIL has 3 children; OP and wife have struggled with infertility for over a decade. It would be very evil (yes, I'm using that word) for SIL to want OP's wife to miscarry just because? When SIL has children already...", "SIL was 100% deliberate in what she said. She is very obviously bitter and resentful of OP and his wife for her being pregnant. She seems jealous and was intentionally cruel to someone that is already worried about the pregnancy to begin with.\n\nOP you are NTA but your SIL definitely is and what you said was completely warranted considering you've already asked for them to stop talking about the miscarriage. They should've listened. Instead they caused your wife to be even more anxious about her already high risk pregnancy.

It is extremely unlikely that her trauma has been appropriately recognized and treated by her medical team at this point- in fact it takes 30 days after the onset of the traumatic event to even begin evaluating someone properly for PTSD. Let alone making any progress in treatment. And that's if it  is identified- most women with perinatal trauma and complicated grief do NOT get the help they need. They are told to go home and try again or \"at least you have other children\" and left to fester in untreated severe mental illness for years. And then blamed when they behave like someone with untreated mental illness.\n\nSomeone in her stage of grief and trauma literally cannot think properly.

I've had many people around me have miscarriages (or how it's been punctuated in other comments, still births) \n\nI had family apologise for not coming to kids bdays or religious celebrations for these reasons and we've always been super understanding of it. \n\nThat is the appropriate behaviour for the situation. Not force your negativity on people who are experiencing their first pregnancy where she's had 2 healthy ones and the last still birth.\n\nI feel like it was very inconsiderate considering it was a high risk pregnancy and they're all very aware of it. If SIL wasn't seeing it, hubby should've. \n\nThere's no excuse for evil. And that comment is pure evil.\n\nAlso let's not forget she didn't apologise for what she said.
