I had a few drinks and his dad had two, since he was gonna drive.\n\nBut on the way back his dad started asking me \"you work on self driving cars, yeah?\" (I do, I'm a systems engineer and have job hopped between a handful of autonomy companies.) \n\nHe started asking me how I liked his Tesla and I joked \"just fine as long as you're the one driving it!\" And he asked me what I thought about FSD which he'd just bought. He asked if he should turn it on. I said \"not with me in the car\" and he then laughed and asked how I was still so scared when I work with this stuff everyday. \n\nI was like \"Uhh it's because I...\" But stopped when he pulled over and literally started turning it on. I was like \"I'm not kidding, let me out of the car if you're gonna do this\" and my boyfriend's dad and brother started laughing at me, and my boyfriend still wasn't saying anything. \n\nHis dad was like \"It'll be fine\" and I reached over my boyfriend's little brother and tried the door handle which was locked. I was getting mad, and probably moreso because I was tipsy, and I yelled at him \"Let me the fuck out\" \n\nMy boyfriend started trying to tell me to calm down because I was drunk and I told him that it didn't fucking matter, I'd be outta here sober or drunk. He told me to stop cussing in front of his little brother, and I told him to tell his dad to cut his shit out and I wouldn't have anything to cuss over. \n\nHis dad was like \"fine, I didn't realize it'd be suuuch a big deal\" and drove home normally, but things have been tense as hell. \n\nWe got back to his house and he was mad at me for \"overreacting\" the first time I met his family all together. I got angry and was like \"I'm not the one who decided to do the ONE THING that I said I'm not comfortable with in the car, just after I asked him not to, to laugh at me\"  \n\nHe said that his dad used the car a lot, and it was fine, and I asked him (since we're both rock climbers) would he ever get on a route with his carbainer that doesn't lock? What if someone says they do it all the time and it's fine? He was like \"absolutely not, but that's different\" and I was like \"it's literally not, just like we don't know any climbers who'd do that shit, nobody in my field that I know would stay in that car.\n\nHe got mad and told me to go to sleep, I was drunk. But honestly today I woke up sober and I stand by what I did, like I wasn't comfortable with what was happening and my boyfriend's family all laughed and started trying to do the one fucking thing I said no to? Like whatever that thing is, it's fucked up.\n\nAITA for yelling at my boyfriend's dad to let me out of the car?\n\nEdit - I'm not trying to get into fights about who my favorite billionaire is or isn't.

Car VEERED towards the biker.  Scared the absolute hell out of me.  No thank you.  Idk why it did that beyond thinking I was being unsafe but it trying to control things when I was 100% acting safer was enough for me to decide I\u2019d never be comfortable with my son in car.", "NTA. They crossed a boundary you very respectfully put in place. That\u2019s not okay no matter what your boundary was. Also, unrelated but what is going on with the self driving feature that nobody who works on it will be in the car with it on?", "Honestly I don\u2019t have anything to do with anybody who thinks it\u2019s funny to scare me.

If it makes you that uncomfortable then he should have just waited until you weren't in the car", "NTA, for many reasons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.) You have the absolute right to control your exposure to a harmful environment. If you ask them not to do something when the option not to doesn't harm them, and they do it anyway, that's a problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.) You deserve respect. You clearly communicated a boundary and they utterly disregarded it, while also trying to make sure you were stuck in with them (the locked door).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3.) Teslas are well-known for being highly dangerous vehicles that can essentially become an uncontrollable tube of death on \"full self-driving\" mode. You have a right to walk away from situations with a high likelihood of death.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou and your boyfriend really, **really** need to sit down and talk about why he and his family think it's appropriate to disregard, disrespect, and downplay your legitimate boundaries and fears.", "NTA. I\u2019m very curious, kind of astonished even, that no one in his family asked you WHY you feel as you do. You are a freaking systems engineer on these cars and you refusing to be in one while it is in self driving mode should\u2019ve been a HUGE indicator that the technology is flawed or Tesla is flawed.", "NTA. I read just a few of your expert comments and don't want to get in any self-driving vehicles. So who is going to be responsible when Tesla's self driving big rigs hit the road full time.  I never trusted a computer to drive for me in any case. Yes, you freaked out. You know how dangerous that car was. YOU are the expert, not a bunch of yahoo's who don't understand that if their car wrecks because the computer screws up it's all on them. It drives me crazy how if you had been a man they might have listened to you. You are one kick butt woman. Your boyfriend didn't even back you up. He blasted you for it when you got home. His father crossed your one boundary. Instead of asking why you felt that way as the expert, they laughed. Not a good start to a long term relationship.", "NTA, OP. Gotta say that I'm honestly concerned more about how your boyfriend dismisses your concerns, tries to make you out to be the hysterical drunk female, and even after the fact tells you that you were in the wrong for establishing and protecting a boundary.\n\nObviously this isn't  a picture of your entire relationship and the whole picture might look very different, but I think I would be reconsidering whether this is a person I want to date, especially if he's going to put his family's very minor preference over (WELL-JUSTIFIED, but I mean, they shouldn't even need to be justified in this case) your feelings of safety and security.\n\nHe's being awfully assheaded for someone in his 40s.", "\"Wanna see me drive on the wrong side of the road?

Your boyfriend's father enjoys laughing at scared people, and your boyfriend is cool with it.  That tells you something about both of them.", "NTA. No one else in that car understands or gives you credit for knowing what you are talking about. They certainly don't respect your knowledge and experience. Aren't you tired of being treated like less than equal?", "NTA. You have the right to leave any situation in which you are uncomfortable. You stated in advance what you were comfortable with, and this was not respected. These people are not a good family for you to be friends with or date them, any of them.

It's an AH move to know something makes someone else uncomfortable and to do it anyway.

It\u2019s like some parallel universe (or maybe it\u2019s just ego). \n\nWhat is even worse is that your boyfriend doubled down, even after you rationally explained it.

Oh yes, kidnapping and illegal imprisonment.  Which apparently your boyfriend feels are acceptable actions.  Admittedly this likely wouldn't be escalated to a court and accomplish anything but it seems worth keeping in mind that your boyfriend will forcibly restrict you from leaving somewhere if he feels like it.\n\nDon't believe me lets take a look at a parallel.  If your bf invited you to a friend gathering and someone there was acting creepy, and your bf just laughed because \"that's just how they are\" and you decided to leave and he physically stood in front of the door arguing with you that you needed to stay and just accept it, would you be asking if you were the asshole when you started yelling for him to get out of the way?

This should not be taken to indicate any current or past employer's position.)\n\nA number of companies are working on self driving tech. I have, and would, get into a number of their vehicles.  Just not Teslas. \n\nMany of the competing companies are at a similar level of technology development. However every other company is either...\n\n1.  manning every vehicle with a highly trained safety driver / monitoring engineer pair who know the system inside out and is trained to avert emergencies, and is extremely focused. They usually take short (like 15 minute) shifts because it's hard to keep that extreme  focus. Or..\n\n2. Operating in a very very severely limited domain (in terms of location, weather, etc..) with 1:1 remote monitoring with a highly trained person monitoring every vehicle and able to intervene in a moment. These people also take short shifts. Or...\n\n3. Operating away from people (I.E. hauling vehicles for mining operations, which do not use public roads and where the mine roads are laid out so no people are permitted on the autonomous hauling routes. \n\nBut tesla does not do any of that. They don't have trained safety drivers, live remote monitoring, or constained operational domains. They don't limit how long a single person can operate the vehicle, despite widely accepted evidence on how focus degrades over time. \n\nThey have similar (or arguably worse) self driving technology to other companies. But while the other 30 or so companies in this space are being responsible for the safety of their vehicles with live monitoring, and trained engineer intervention, Tesla is just letting random consumers take on that role (and liability)\n\nIt's not a good place to be, as a consumer, to be doing the same dangerous job that other people are being paid 6 figures to do. Without training. For free. Hell, worse than free, you're paying to take on a corporation's liability. \n\nThis allows them to avoid paying for some of the usual research and development costs like safety drivers and live monitoring, and it also offloads a lot of liability of testing a very very new and unreliable technology from them as a corporation onto their consumers.\n\nIt also helps them appear \"ahead\" in technology development, while honestly under the hood, I'd say they're behind and simply appearing ahead because they're bypassing safety practices and engineering rigor that other companies are following. \n\nFor example, every time a driver claims FSD or Autopilot error, and Tesla claims driver error, that is a shifting of liability that the other companies in this space would not do. All the other companies take the liability of their technology failing on themselves. \n\nTesla is pushing liability onto the end-user and their insurance policies which are generally unequipped to handle claims regarding AV malfunction, and publicly denying any accusations of malfunction. However other companies developing similar tech are purchasing insurance themselves at very high rates, and being transparent with their insurers about the risks they're undertaking. \n\nI don't see that as ethical, as they're pushing the danger and accident liability onto the consumer, at a very early stage of technology development. I also don't see that as safe for the consumer.\n\nIt's a joke in my field that if you pay for FSD, you're paying to be a crash test dummy...", "Reminds me of airline mechanics.
