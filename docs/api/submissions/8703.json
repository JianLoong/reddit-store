That's all I'm going to say about that. \n\nMy daughter is ten year old and she just got her first period.  I grew up with sisters and I am not a complete idiot so I had read up on what to do. I had also talked to my mom and sisters about it.  I had been prepared since she was 8. I gave her the boxes of pads and tampons.  I explained to her that it was normal and healthy.  I watched a video with her that was a tutorial on what to do.  I also asked her if she would like to talk to either my sister or the woman I'm seeing about how to do everything right. \n\nShe said that she understood and would like to talk to my sister on the weekend.  After dinner on Saturday my sister talked to me about it. She said that I had gotten the basics correct and there were only a couple of things she needed to explain or correct. \n\nMy ex called to talk to the kids yesterday and afterwards yelled at me on the phone.  She called me an asshole for excluding her from a milestone in her daughter's life.  I asked her if it had happened during her week with the kids if she would have told me about it.  She said that wasn't the point. It was a mother daughter thing and that I took it away from her.

Anyway, well done", "NTA\n\nIt's a natural and normal part of your daughter's life. You are her parent and guardian.\n\nYour DAUGHTER can decide to share that info or not. You did absolutely nothing wrong tending to her immediate needs.", "NTA - Your did your research and didn't necessarily need to ask your ex for help on this one? The main thing is that your daughter got the help and support she needed.", "NTA.

While it is true that it is usually the mother who deals with their daughters' period education, it shouldn't have to be. And since you are the custodial parent and she got her period while with you, you did what you needed to, and you made sure your daughter also had a woman to talk to for any questions.\n\nIn an ideal world, you would have notified your ex about it, but in an ideal world she wouldn't be an ex and you wouldn't be parenting separately.\n\nHer actions stem from her jealousy on missing a milestone, but that is a her problem and not a you problem, and your daughter cannot schedule all of her female development to only happen when she is with her mother.", "NTA.\n\nAnd it's really weird to make it a teary-eyed mummy-daughter moment. No. It's not buying a wedding dress or going to a graduation. It's bleeding and owie and reassurance.\n\nYou did fine.", "NTA because on balance you did almost everything right\u2026 except suggest her mom as someone she could talk to when you gave her an either/or, excluding her from a major moment in the kid\u2019s life.", "NTA: I think something like that is a decision that OP's daughter has the right to make; and it sounds like she was fine with telling her mother about it in their call.

Pretty sure your kid didn't really want the whole planet celebrating the event, so keeping it low-key was the way to go.\n\nAlso, \"mother-daughter thing\", lol.

Let your daughter make the decision who she goes to for advice on that, because its her body.  She told her mom when she felt the time was right.", "NTA\n\nAssuming the daughter can freely text or call her mom as is the norm, your only responsiblity was to let mom know sometime in advance of her next parenting time so she can be prepared imo.  \n\nWhile I can sort of get her reaction on a primitive level, it isn't Mom's first period to own.\n\nWhat were you supposed to do--tell the kid to call her mom so she wouldn't feel 'excluded' from her bodily functions?", "NTA-sounds like you offered her good support and info and her needs were met.", "NTA. You\u2019re a good dad! I\u2019m 55 and am still waiting for a family member to explain it to me. \n\nYou were prepared and it sounds like you handled it perfectly. \n\nI can understand your wife\u2019s disappointment but you have primary custody because of her extensive travels. She knew that since she\u2019s out of town so often, it was more than possible your daughter would get her period when she was out of town.\n\nShe should have prepared and had a talk with your daughter beforehand and because she wanted to share a part of this milestone, she should have told your daughter to call her day or night when it happened so they can talk.

You were there, and it sounds like you handled everything just fine. You didn't exclude her from anything, she wasn't available to share that moment. The only thing you could have done was call her and let her know.", "Info: did you not tell your ex because you wanted to punish her or because you forgot? I think therein lies your answer.", "NTA. Your ex should be glad you were prepared to help your daughter. I think you did a great job as a dad.", "NTA you did awesome. Sounds like you're a good dad and your daughter won't forget it.", "NTA. The absolute priority in this situation is that your daughter is comfortable having discussed this, knows what to do and expect, and was prepared.

She will remember what both parents do and how both act, and although (like me) you may always feel like you lost out or have the worse side of the situation, your life will be better if you can be the bigger person, and it\u2019ll allow you not be an even better dad to your daughter. Good luck with things OP and we\u2019ll done for being prepared - a lot of fathers wouldn\u2019t have been.", "NTA.  Meh - maybe you should've let her know, but honestly, you sound like a great dad for doing everything you did.", "NTA. You are the primary caregiver and did everything right to help your daughter. She is old enough to share this milestone with her mom and she clearly did so, which is great. If you don't regularly share updates with the mom I don't see why this occasion warranted a special call.", "NTA. What did she expect you to do? Film your daughter telling you she got her period? Flip a switch behind your daughter's ear that would turn off her period until she got home so she could experience this \"milestone\" with her?\n\nYou did what any good parent would do. You explained what was happening, supported her but didn't make a big deal out of it, gave her tools to deal with it, and offered her options for support that knew more about what was happening than you.", "NTA as the primary parent it was absolutely right that you dealt with it and I'm sure had your daughter wanted to talk to her mother about it she would have asked. You handled everything very sensitively and good for you for being a good parent to your daughter.", "NTA, but I think you should have let her mom know. Keep in mind she is still your kid's mom. Sounds like you are a great dad.", "Bravo for being prepared. Maybe you could have told mom, but she shouldn't be this upset. The energy should go towards the kids. Keep up the great parenting.", "Honestly my ex and i aren\u2019t on good terms either but i know he would have at least told me if our daughter started on his weekend or brought her home. Thankfully she started while she was with me and i\u2019ve not needed to discuss it with her dad YET. \n\nOp i would have at least given my ex a heads up if i were you\u2026..\n\nClearly your ex and daughter aren\u2019t as close as ex thought. Ex had no right to yell at you, op you can\u2019t schedule when your daughter starts her cycle.

Your wife was out of town and the issue had to be addressed.\n\nThis kind of thing is better dealt with in person instead of by phone in my opinion anyway. You did quite well, as  a matter of fact.", "NTA....could you have given her a heads up? Sure.  Here's the big thing...When you offered her adults to talk to, she didn't say \" I want Mommy.\"   That reeeeeeally jumps out at me.", "NTA\n\nUnder the circumstances, you did extremely well.  I commend you for learning what you could so you could explain to your child what was happening with her body.  You gave her a couple of choices of the other ladies in your life to answer any questions your daughter might have.  I don\u2019t think you intentionally left your ex off the list.  I\u2019m sure it was more likely you just named a couple of people off the top of your head.", "NTA - You didn't keep your daughter from calling her mother right?", "NTA. If your daughter wanted her mom, I\u2019m sure she would have asked. You went out of your way to make sure you were prepared and got her everything she needed.", "NTA. You did what you thought was best. I personally think it should of been up to your daughter if she wanted to tell her mom.", "NTA \n\nI WISH my father was this open with girls having their period and thats a normal when my mom left to go to Europe to see family I was stuck with my dad for 2 WHOLE MONTHS and yk when mother nature decided to come and stay for a week asking for essential were like \" I need to go to the store to get stuff because I'm sick \" God typing that sounds so much weird than just saying \"HEY CAN I GO TO THE STORE AND GET PADS OR TAMPONS\" yea.... so anyways you did amazing your daughter is definitely really lucky to have a father normalizing this and your ex is definitely being dramatic when was that a mother daughter bonding ??? That sounds more strange than asking my dad indirectly for pads  ..", "NTA because you did what you're supposed to do. Your daughter is the priority, not your ex. \n\nThat said, this is a big milestone for a girl and I would be hurt if my ex didn't tell me BUT, I'm the mom and the primary guardian, we both see our daughter every week and we co-parent and get along very well so I can't in good conscience consider you TA for not sharing the news.", "Everyone saying it's a major mildstone make me very uncomfortable lmfao. I hate talking about my period and I'd be embarrassed if I found out my mother was trying to argue over my period. She sounds like she's trying to argue over nothing in my opinion. I didn't tell either of my parents for two whole years because my mom was so weird about it and would often ask embarrassing questions in front of my whole family. She definitely would not have told you about it if it happened at her house. NTA.", "NTA. What did your Ex expect you to do? Just tell your daughter to deal with it till she went back to her moms?", "ESH (you & ex)\n\nI'm glad you had educated yourself in preparation for this event. Sounds like you did a good job with it. \n\nAs a co-parent, you have an obligation to inform the other parent about things like this. Don't leave it on your daughter to have to tell her mom. It's not her responsibility to be the go-between just because you don't like talking to ex. Ex needs to be able to make sure she has age-appropriate products available at her place. \n\nYour statement that it was a parent kid medical issue and therefore a you thing is leaving out that ex is ALSO a parent. She has the right to be included in medical things. \n\nOne would hope that if it had happened at your ex's place that yes, she would have told you: so that you could have age-appropriate products available at your place, and also so that your daughter doesn't have to be the go-between. So ex is an AH for not saying that (\"it's beside the point\"? no. it IS the point)\n\nLike her or not, you and ex are co-parents. CO. That means that it is on YOU to share information the other parent should have. Anything involving a medical issue (and yes, starting menstruation is a medical issue) is REQUIRED to be shared with the other parent. So suck it up and CO-PARENT.", "NTA. Mom could have had a preparatory conversation if she wanted to be involved.  My only suggestion is to not refer to menstruation as a medical issue, but a hygiene issue.   Menstruation is not a disease or condition that needs to be treated.  Just a normal part of being human that about half the population experiences.  Sounds like you did a good job explaining how she should take care of herself.", "NTA\nThis isn't a mother daughter thing. This is a daughter thing, and as such, she is the only one who matters in this situation.  You were the parent at bat, and you handled it. Now it's up to your daughters discretion on what and who she tells about her body and its bodily functions.", "NTA but i think as a courtesy you should have told the mom.", "NTA and good for you for being prepared!", "NTA, I love how you handled this.", "NTA- your ex wife chose her career over her children and seems not to call very often. If she would have put more of an effort into her relationship with her daughter I\u2019m sure your daughter would have called her first. \nShe is mad because she sucks as a mom and knows it.", "NTA - good job, sounds like you did the right things! Kiddo could have told/rang mum if she wanted to. Thanks for making her first period not a big deal!", "NTA. Honestly your ex probably should have brought it up to your daughter and explained it a while ago if she thought it was a \u201cmother daughter\u201d thing. \n\nGood for you for making sure your daughter felt safe and prepared both before and when it happened.", "NTA at all! You did everything right. Offered her the options of pads and tampons, sat down and watched an educational video with her and had some trusted women for her to talk with about it. You\u2019re clearly a caring father and did everything you could to make your daughter comfortable during this confusing time for her. For the record, when I got my first period my mom went out and got me pads, and that was that. She asked me if I had learned about periods in school, I said yes (my school system had a relatively comprehensive puberty section in our health class in middle school where they separated the boys and girls to learn about the changes in their bodies), and she left it at that. Thank you for normalizing fathers being there for their daughters during puberty. Your ex can talk to your daughter next time she sees her. Til then, keep it up!", "NTA. I believe what you did was perfect. After having 2 girls, I don\u2019t see this as a mother/daughter milestone either. And I am guessing that neither does your daughter or she would have said she preferred talking to her mother instead of your sister. It\u2019s not a milestone, it\u2019s a very painful mess every month. The only thing it indicates is that she will soon be able to bear children. You don\u2019t get suddenly mature and it doesn\u2019t magically give you any ability to do anything better or understand things better.", "NTA your daughter could have asked for mom at any time. Please remove the mindset that it's a medical issue though, it's normal and natural and doesn't need any form of medical issue if the bleeding stops, there aren't large clots, mental health is good, minimal to no pain, etc.", "NTA. I can get where she's coming from and wanting to be involved but honestly what could she have done? You seem to have done a good job, had all your ducks ready and in a row so I'd say you did an amazing job. Especially being a dad when many dad's fail or just push it off on mom. \n\nGood job", "NTA. You handled it appropriately. She was out of town and not available. You offered the next best people - her aunt and your gf. You did your best.", "NTA.", "Well, you asked your daughter if she wanted to talk to your sister or partner, it would have been reasonable to include her mother in that list, so she had that option.\nAnd while I think it should have been your daughter\u2019s choice, it would have been nice if you had asked your daughter if it was ok for you to let her mother know.\nNOt TA for having prepared and supported your child, but it is in her interests that you are civil to her mother and don\u2019t create or encourage hostility or put your kid in the middle of awkward situations, and a quick text or call to her to let her know would have been appropriate and could have avoided the row, and would have cost you nothing.\n\nAlso, I think it is a bit different from most medical stuff but equally, most medical things are going to be things that it would be reasonable for you to keep her mother informed about.\n\nSo on balance, ESH. Your ex for making it all about her, and you for not considering that she might want to know and that telling her would make life easier for your daughter by limiting conflict that she is exposed to.", "NTA, parenting of a child is not a gender-specific activity.  When my eldest wanted to get a bra - she went to her dad (I was travelling for work as well).  He took her shopping, and all was well, and I was proud of them both.  1 - that my (now) ex would do anything for our daughter, and 2 - that my daughter knew she could go to her dad for anything.  Your ex is the AH for thinking only she can parent a female child.", "Yta telling her to  ask the woman your seeing over her mom. You could have offered to let her phone mom. I'm happy you read up and handled it but yeah. It's something you should have gotten her to call mom about", "YTA.  While you did nothing wrong in having the conversation with your daughter, you should have offered her to speak to her mother about this.  Not your sister and the woman you are seeing, her mom.  If she asked to speak to your sister instead, that would have been fine.  You also should be keeping the other parent informed about what is going on with your children.  She should have been told this happened because it will likely occur in her home at some point.  I think you are allowing your bitterness to exclude her as a parent.  You have to love your children more than you hate your ex.  Facilitating and encouraging a healthy relationship with both parents is part of that.", "Slight YTA - Some of your comments keep pressing upon the issue that the mom was so many miles away.  Yes your daughter could have contacted her mother, but the way you speak about the mother makes me think the daughter did not want to contact her because of how YOU react to the mom.  I mean I get it, horrible ending to the marriage, etc. but that is still her mother.  Do you speak ill of the mom in front of your children?  Could be why she did not want to reach out.  You did what you could, you did well as a dad but I think you still should have let your ex know.", "YTA. It's not clear from the post if the mother was available by phone, but if she was, surely you could have provided your daughter with the boxes of stuff, encouraged her that is was normal and then let her speak with her mom to get the rest of the stuff. If not, there's no reason whatsoever other than your bitterness towards your ex (whether deserved or not) to not give her a headsup on what is going on.", "Soft YTA only for not telling her. Even though you\u2019re the primary parent, she\u2019s still a parent, and it\u2019s important for her to know about milestones like this when they happen on your watch. Even if she\u2019s petty enough to not do the same, you\u2019re the one setting a good example for your kids.", "YTA. I get it your marriage ended badly but you still have to coparent. Your ex their mom had a right to hear this info from you when it happened. She might have wanted to check in an have a talk with her and mom needs to be ready for visitation time too.", "YTA, you did it out of bitterness and purposefully didn\u2019t mention her when suggesting your daughter talk to someone else, that\u2019s manipulative.", "I mean I'm going to say YTA becaude you didn't even suggest her mom as a female she could talk to. It seems like you are actively trying to alienate her and harm her relationship with her mother. That's not beneficial to your child.", "Going with yta. Instead of talking about to your ex HER mother you decided to talk to your own mom.  I would be pissed too.  As a mom whose has to co parent with my abusive ex I would still have discussed it with him because he is my child\u2019s other parent.", "YTA.", "Slight YTA. It should be your daughter's choice which woman she talks to. It sounds like you made the decision to put your sister between your daughter and her mother, not daughter. \n\nMy YTA is tempered by your ex's view that this is about her. Her milestone moment. Your account of this makes it seem that ex looks at this as being about he, not about her daughter.", "I\u2019m going YTA. My mom wasn\u2019t around much, but she is still the only person I would have wanted to talk to about this as a child. Even though you say you didn\u2019t do it on purpose your entire story about the wife getting attention even though she\u2019s not really attractive reeks of anger and was not really relevant to the story except to be critical. \n\nI think how you handled the part with your daughter was fine, but I think you didn\u2019t call her mother on purpose.", "YTA for the way you talk about the mother of your child", "ESH. Or at least you and your ex wife - I don't have any issues with your daughter or your sisters behavior. You suck because you're not sharing important milestones and things that happened during your time with her mother, and she sucks because apparently she's been allowing this up until it came to something she had strong feelings about....and possibly doing the same thing with things that happen on her time? (Unclear)\n\nYou are coparenting. You need to get over whatever bitterness exists enough to communicate with her about your kids, because THEY need that. It isn't about you guys it's about your kids. \n\nI also think you are being slightly obtuse to pretend you don't know that getting your period is typically a huge milestone shared by mothers and daughters, but I do think the bigger issue is that you seen to really think this is an effective way to co parent.\n\nEDIT: I've decided to change my verdict to NTA because I realized I wasn't actually judging the conflict at hand. I do not think you are the asshole for handling your daughters period yourself, though I do think you are being a bit disingenuous by pretending you didn't anticipate her being annoyed or you didn't know that that is often a mother Daughter milestone.", "YTA you cut your wife right out of the people your daughter could talk to for support. This is a major milestone and you took it away from your daughter. \n\nI dont care about the animosity between you and your ex wife.  I dint care of she slept with all 2000 men on that site. Thats irrelevant. That is a you and her issue. But you need to move past it. \n\nYou both need to pull your heads out of your asses and start being grown ups and learn to be civil towards each other. Not saying that you and her need to be best friends. But seriously stop trying to remove your wife from milestones your children have..\nThat alone makes you a AH", "YTA: Also a man but it seems like that is kind of an important thing that you should have assumed she would want to know about.  The only reason not to is if you thought she was going to engage in some sort of psychologically abusive behavior.  From your description it seems like the issues with your ex are between you and her, not her and your kids so I'm assuming that's not the case.", "YTA. This is a major milestone and was absolutely worthy of a call to your wife, if for no other reason than your daughter might have wanted her mother's support. You said \"it was a child medical thing\" so you shouldn't have had to include your ex - I don't understand that. Are you saying if your daughter broke her leg you wouldn't tell her mother?", "YTA. As a woman, I honestly think it was disrespectful to both your ex and your daughter. Getting your period is an embarrassing, intimidating, intimate thing in a girl's life. By the sound of it, you handled it well as the primary caregiver, BUT you should have talked to her mother about it too. Right away. You are CO-PARENTING. You have to put aside any bitterness between you two for the health of your kids. By the way you talk about your ex, you sound quite disrespectful. \n\nWho knows how your daughter feels about all this - she may have been too embarrassed to bring it up to her mom on her own and this could've distanced their relationship even further. Her mom is her closest female relative to whom she probably feels most comfortable talking about these things. You did a disservice to her by thinking it \"wasn't important\" to share the information with her own mother - who she probably spends quite a bit of time with. Your daughter needs you two to communicate important moments like these to each other so that she doesn't feel like she's being put in the middle of a nasty relationship. Her mom deserved to know.\n\nI would have been furious and hurt as her mother if my ex didn't share that information.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

On one hand i can see legitimate health and safety reasons why both parents should know - whether or not you menstruate is pretty medically important (for ex. I had a friend who used to faint constantly and had chosen not to tell her parents or doctor that she had begun mensturating. It took them near a year to determine she was anemic and her symptoms were exacerbated when she was menstriating. A simple iron supplement fixed the problem and may have prevented her from missing so much achool she was held back that year) and any parent having sole responsibility for a kid at any given time should know important medical information, however I also see your argument for bodily autonomy. I think I lean on the side of it being highly situational. \n\nAs I've restated a few times though, my insistence that co parents should be sharing important goings on that happen when the other parent is not around is much more general than this specific question and I stand by it.", "If you read my comment I don't really have issues with the period specifically, more the idea that he doesnt communicate issues and milestones or really at all with his coparent. Which is why I changed my verdict and apologized to OP because I wasn't fairly judging the question he asked. But aside from that I don't care how old the kids you are co parenting are - it requires communication with each other.", "I think you did good. You kid is 10, she could have called her mom herself, but chose not to disclose, and you chose to give her her privacy. Any respectful of their kid's autonomy would have done the same.", "I changed my verdict because I realized I wasn't really answering your actual question. I don't think you are the asshole for handling the period yourself, but I do have issues with coparents not talking with each other. It wasn't very fair for me to focus on that though since that wasn't what you asked.", "I'm not acting like that. Of course she can. But she is ten, and generally speaking people understand that ten year Olds don't make the right decisions and need their parents help. I even specifically told a story about a friend of mine who was young and chose to keep this info to herself not understanding the harm because she was a child. \n\nIdc if you agree with me but you don't need to twist my viewpoint. I don't care whether she is capable or not, I believe she is a child and knowing why it's important to share medical information with the people caring for her isn't her responsibility.", "NTA, you didn't have to call, You don't have to shout out on every roof that your daughter had her periods for the first time, The Yta's are being weird, it's a normal body thing, You Gave Your Daughter everything she needed, Was their for her and later took it to a woman to explain it further. End of the story", "I don\u2019t see getting a period as a milestone, for me it\u2019s a huge inconvenience", "I say NTA. You did the right thing as a whole.\n\nBut for many women, this is a celebration between mom and daughter. This may include storytelling, maybe a celebratory meal, etc. \n\nAll that can still happen. Even if it's after your ex' current shift. Hence I think ex needs to know about things like this in a timely manner. \n\nSo bear that all in mind. Don't take opportunities away from your daughter in the future that exclude your ex, because of resentment. Ex may be a horrible woman in your eyes. But she is still mom. That's a role that you cannot replicate. Not in your daughter's eyes.", "I think you should post an edit about it or people will keep asking/blaming you about it", "Did you daughter ask you not to share with her?  Did you include her mother in the suggestions of people she could talk to?\n\nIf there's some kind of issue between your ex wife and daughter you might have been justified in not sharing, but it's a crappy thing to do if the issue is your relationship with her (your ex wife).  I mean even your framing of it (Parent/kid medical issue).  If your either of your children had some sort of medical issue while in your wife's care would you not want to know about it?", "So you don\u2019t think mom needs to know so she can have the appropriate pads when daughter is at her house?", "You're right, it should be the 10 yos choice. But doesn't look like dad made that choice available. His reaction was \"do you want to talk to your aunt or my girlfriend?\" Never even suggested mother. And obviously the 10 yo knows the dad tries to avoid talking to the mom, I highly doubt she'd say, \"dad can you call my mom whom you very obviously hate?\"", "I get a first period being intimidating. I was scared when I got mine. \nI wasn\u2019t embarrassed, it\u2019s the people around you that make it embarrassing", "I don\u2019t want to ever talk to my dad about my period . I\u2019m just giving my opinion of a girl growing up. That would have been mortifying for me. I would have called my mom or aunt or asked to talk to my mom or my aunt about it. Def would never want to talk about it with the new girlfriend.", "Both of y\u2019all are ignoring the fact that daughter herself didn\u2019t reach out to mom, when asked if she wanted to talk to another woman she chose to talk to her aunt. And no where in the post did OP say daughter couldn\u2019t contact mom to talk about it. Daughter just didn\u2019t.", "As the daughter of a single father I think both you and /u/ClipClipClip99 should both be fucking embarrassed to post something like this", "My daughter could call her at any point in time.  She chose not to.", "I mean, I'm a woman and it's not a big deal. It's going to happen to basically every female at some point. Why turn nothing into something?", "I have never once tried to limit communication between my kids and their mom.  She could have called her mom before talking to me, after talking time, during the time I was trying my best to help her out, that evening while I was watching Netflix, in the morning before school, from the bus in the way to school.  Is there some other way I can communicate that I do not in any way inhibit my children from talking to their mom.  Let's pretend that my kids are older and changing a tire.  And they mess up and the car comes off the jack.  No one gets hurt but they might need extra help figuring out how to deal.  And it is my ex's week.  Should she Skype me for help or ask her father who she lives with or her brother who owns a tow truck for help.  Since they can be physically present and able to help sooner than ten days later?", "My kid knows what a period is.  I thought she might benefit from talking to someone she knows and trusts and could explain the more esoteric acts involved in feminine hygiene products.", "Talking to someone in person is easier and more helpful", "My daughter could contact her mother at any point in time.  I don't need to be included in their conversations.   My daughter chose not to call her mom.", "And my daughter chose not to contact her.", "And my daughter had access to it.", "Yes it does.  It means she cheated on him.", "Some ppl just can't read huh", "My ex wife is not ugly.  I was very clear in stating that I personally still think that she is beautiful.   She had some self esteem issues.", "I do not speak to her unless I need to. My children have access to her on email, texting, phone calls, and Skype.   I personally don't talk to my ex since I had to get a lawyer involved to keep her away from me.", "scolding you??? tf is wrong with him", "No my kids can talk to their mom whenever they feel like it.", "The dad already have supplied her kid with all she needs. Those thing don't expire. She can pack as many as she likes for the little period of time she spend with her mom. If the kid want to go around without telling her mom, it's her choice.", "I think he suggested people that were available right away. The mom seemed like she was in the middle of her 2 weeks away time. I'm assuming the 10yo has access to her mother via text of phone at whenever she wants (it doesn't say one way or another) but it's not like she could assist at that time.", "Fair. I was concerned when I started my period (at 9), but when my mom (who hadn\u2019t told me anything yet) started crying and saying my childhood was over, that shit fucked me up pretty bad.\n\nMy point is that dad saying \u201comg this is such a big deal, you must be terrified, don\u2019t do anything until I call your mother\u201d would have made the girl feel embarrassed and more scared than she already was. \n\nA parent handling it calmly and matter-of-factly, then asking if she needed female/emotional support, is the best way to alleviate those fears and make it non-embarassing.", "exactly, everyone is assuming the worst", "Yeah but he\u2019s not a single dad. He\u2019s letting his hate for his ex impact his daughter.", "It *can* be an important thing to many girls. She should have been asked if she\u2019d like to chat with her mom, aunt, or dad\u2019s girlfriend. My mom was out of town when I got my first period so my teenage brother got to help me and then later my dad. I knew logically them helping wasn\u2019t a big deal, and didn\u2019t want to make it a big deal by asking to talk to my mom. But when my dad asked me if I had spoken to her I was relieved he called her and I did feel better after talking to my mom.", "[removed]", "I get what you're saying but I also think you're being a little deliberately obtuse. You can't say in one sentence that it's merely a medical issue that you should be able to handle on your own and in the next say that she might need a close female relative to help answer questions. You have to acknowledge that for a lot of young girls (maybe yours isn't one) having their first period is something they would want to talk to their mothers about. I think in a healthy co-parenting relationship you absolutely would have asked your daughter if she wanted to call her Mom. I think you don't like your ex so you specifically left her name out of it.\n\nThink of it this way: if you and your ex were still together, would you have informed her about this and asked your daughter if she wanted to talk to mom? If so, why wouldn't you do that now?", "Because you gave your daughter other options and her mother wasn't one of them", "WOW, you would rather put this on your daughter then to consider a different opinion/take on this?!? Good luck op, clearly this issue is just the a tiny pinnacle of a much larger mountain.", "No she did not. You made that choice for her by excluding her mother when you presented her a selection of women she could talk to", "You made it clear to your daughter that you wanted her to talk to your girlfriend instead of her mother. That is awful. YTA.", "A lot.", "But how are her self-esteem issues relevant to why you won't talk to her?", "I don't know man, this seems pretty childish to me.  Unless your ex is a crappy mom you should take it upon yourself to share information with her, not just foist that responsibility onto your children.", "If you think that a 10 year old child is going to be great at tracking when her period comes, good luck. Those first several cycles you find yourself reacting (hey I need pads now) as opposed to being proactive (looks like I\u2019m running low on pads).", "I don't think you could assume that though. Only half of 10 yos have cell phones (US numbers). And, re-reading, OP suggested his daughter talk to either his sister or *the woman I'm currently seeing*. Obviously the mom has access to phones where she works or she wouldn't have been livid that he didn't call. And the help a girl needs at that time is less physical and more *emotional* support, which can certainly be provided over the phone.", "First of all: I was unaware that you, complex_pin_8155, were the arbiter of what made someone a woman. I\u2019ll be sure to check in with you next time I\u2019m wondering. \n\nSecond, getting your period SHOULDN\u2019T be a big deal. Not in a horrifying way, at least. Dad 100% did the right thing here.", "You\u2019re gross.", "I literally never said I could handle it on my own.

She can also tell her next time she sees her. I don't understand why you would think it's such an urgent matter. It's just period. Just let the girl handle her period like she feels comfortable. If she doesn't want to involve certain people, it's her prerogative.\n\nBeing an incubator doesn't give you 100% access and right on the child you made. Being a mom is earned.", "What part in \u201cI also asked if she would either like to talk to my sister or the woman I\u2019m seeing\u201d suggests that you offered her to call her mother? You excluded her mother. You are alienating your child from her mother. I don\u2019t care that her mother is making this about her. You are an asshole. You said everything in such a matter that a 10yo would understand that her mother would not be a safe person to talk to."]}
