That's all I'm going to say about that. \n\nMy daughter is ten year old and she just got her first period.  I grew up with sisters and I am not a complete idiot so I had read up on what to do. I had also talked to my mom and sisters about it.  I had been prepared since she was 8. I gave her the boxes of pads and tampons.  I explained to her that it was normal and healthy.  I watched a video with her that was a tutorial on what to do.  I also asked her if she would like to talk to either my sister or the woman I'm seeing about how to do everything right. \n\nShe said that she understood and would like to talk to my sister on the weekend.  After dinner on Saturday my sister talked to me about it. She said that I had gotten the basics correct and there were only a couple of things she needed to explain or correct. \n\nMy ex called to talk to the kids yesterday and afterwards yelled at me on the phone.  She called me an asshole for excluding her from a milestone in her daughter's life.  I asked her if it had happened during her week with the kids if she would have told me about it.  She said that wasn't the point. It was a mother daughter thing and that I took it away from her.

She told her mom when she felt the time was right.", "NTA\n\nAssuming the daughter can freely text or call her mom as is the norm, your only responsiblity was to let mom know sometime in advance of her next parenting time so she can be prepared imo.  \n\nWhile I can sort of get her reaction on a primitive level, it isn't Mom's first period to own.\n\nWhat were you supposed to do--tell the kid to call her mom so she wouldn't feel 'excluded' from her bodily functions?", "NTA-sounds like you offered her good support and info and her needs were met.", "NTA.

She knew that since she\u2019s out of town so often, it was more than possible your daughter would get her period when she was out of town.\n\nShe should have prepared and had a talk with your daughter beforehand and because she wanted to share a part of this milestone, she should have told your daughter to call her day or night when it happened so they can talk.

You were there, and it sounds like you handled everything just fine. You didn't exclude her from anything, she wasn't available to share that moment.

Meh - maybe you should've let her know, but honestly, you sound like a great dad for doing everything you did.", "NTA. You are the primary caregiver and did everything right to help your daughter.

If you don't regularly share updates with the mom I don't see why this occasion warranted a special call.", "NTA. What did she expect you to do? Film your daughter telling you she got her period? Flip a switch behind your daughter's ear that would turn off her period until she got home so she could experience this \"milestone\" with her?\n\nYou did what any good parent would do. You explained what was happening, supported her but didn't make a big deal out of it, gave her tools to deal with it, and offered her options for support that knew more about what was happening than you.", "NTA as the primary parent it was absolutely right that you dealt with it and I'm sure had your daughter wanted to talk to her mother about it she would have asked. You handled everything very sensitively and good for you for being a good parent to your daughter.", "NTA, but I think you should have let her mom know. Keep in mind she is still your kid's mom.

Keep up the great parenting.", "Honestly my ex and i aren\u2019t on good terms either but i know he would have at least told me if our daughter started on his weekend or brought her home. Thankfully she started while she was with me and i\u2019ve not needed to discuss it with her dad YET. \n\nOp i would have at least given my ex a heads up if i were you\u2026..\n\nClearly your ex and daughter aren\u2019t as close as ex thought.

You did quite well, as  a matter of fact.", "NTA....could you have given her a heads up? Sure.  Here's the big thing...When you offered her adults to talk to, she didn't say \" I want Mommy.\"   That reeeeeeally jumps out at me.", "NTA\n\nUnder the circumstances, you did extremely well.  I commend you for learning what you could so you could explain to your child what was happening with her body.  You gave her a couple of choices of the other ladies in your life to answer any questions your daughter might have.  I don\u2019t think you intentionally left your ex off the list.  I\u2019m sure it was more likely you just named a couple of people off the top of your head.", "NTA - You didn't keep your daughter from calling her mother right?", "NTA. If your daughter wanted her mom, I\u2019m sure she would have asked. You went out of your way to make sure you were prepared and got her everything she needed.", "NTA. You did what you thought was best.

That sounds more strange than asking my dad indirectly for pads  ..", "NTA because you did what you're supposed to do. Your daughter is the priority, not your ex. \n\nThat said, this is a big milestone for a girl and I would be hurt if my ex didn't tell me BUT, I'm the mom and the primary guardian, we both see our daughter every week and we co-parent and get along very well so I can't in good conscience consider you TA for not sharing the news.", "Everyone saying it's a major mildstone make me very uncomfortable lmfao. I hate talking about my period and I'd be embarrassed if I found out my mother was trying to argue over my period. She sounds like she's trying to argue over nothing in my opinion. I didn't tell either of my parents for two whole years because my mom was so weird about it and would often ask embarrassing questions in front of my whole family. She definitely would not have told you about it if it happened at her house. NTA.", "NTA. What did your Ex expect you to do? Just tell your daughter to deal with it till she went back to her moms?", "ESH (you & ex)\n\nI'm glad you had educated yourself in preparation for this event. Sounds like you did a good job with it. \n\nAs a co-parent, you have an obligation to inform the other parent about things like this. Don't leave it on your daughter to have to tell her mom. It's not her responsibility to be the go-between just because you don't like talking to ex. Ex needs to be able to make sure she has age-appropriate products available at her place. \n\nYour statement that it was a parent kid medical issue and therefore a you thing is leaving out that ex is ALSO a parent. She has the right to be included in medical things. \n\nOne would hope that if it had happened at your ex's place that yes, she would have told you: so that you could have age-appropriate products available at your place, and also so that your daughter doesn't have to be the go-between. So ex is an AH for not saying that (\"it's beside the point\"? no. it IS the point)\n\nLike her or not, you and ex are co-parents. CO. That means that it is on YOU to share information the other parent should have. Anything involving a medical issue (and yes, starting menstruation is a medical issue) is REQUIRED to be shared with the other parent. So suck it up and CO-PARENT.", "NTA. Mom could have had a preparatory conversation if she wanted to be involved.  My only suggestion is to not refer to menstruation as a medical issue, but a hygiene issue.   Menstruation is not a disease or condition that needs to be treated.  Just a normal part of being human that about half the population experiences.  Sounds like you did a good job explaining how she should take care of herself.", "NTA\nThis isn't a mother daughter thing. This is a daughter thing, and as such, she is the only one who matters in this situation.  You were the parent at bat, and you handled it. Now it's up to your daughters discretion on what and who she tells about her body and its bodily functions.", "NTA but i think as a courtesy you should have told the mom.", "NTA and good for you for being prepared!", "NTA, I love how you handled this.", "NTA- your ex wife chose her career over her children and seems not to call very often. If she would have put more of an effort into her relationship with her daughter I\u2019m sure your daughter would have called her first. \nShe is mad because she sucks as a mom and knows it.", "NTA - good job, sounds like you did the right things! Kiddo could have told/rang mum if she wanted to. Thanks for making her first period not a big deal!", "NTA. Honestly your ex probably should have brought it up to your daughter and explained it a while ago if she thought it was a \u201cmother daughter\u201d thing. \n\nGood for you for making sure your daughter felt safe and prepared both before and when it happened.", "NTA at all! You did everything right. Offered her the options of pads and tampons, sat down and watched an educational video with her and had some trusted women for her to talk with about it. You\u2019re clearly a caring father and did everything you could to make your daughter comfortable during this confusing time for her. For the record, when I got my first period my mom went out and got me pads, and that was that. She asked me if I had learned about periods in school, I said yes (my school system had a relatively comprehensive puberty section in our health class in middle school where they separated the boys and girls to learn about the changes in their bodies), and she left it at that. Thank you for normalizing fathers being there for their daughters during puberty. Your ex can talk to your daughter next time she sees her. Til then, keep it up!", "NTA. I believe what you did was perfect. After having 2 girls, I don\u2019t see this as a mother/daughter milestone either. And I am guessing that neither does your daughter or she would have said she preferred talking to her mother instead of your sister. It\u2019s not a milestone, it\u2019s a very painful mess every month. The only thing it indicates is that she will soon be able to bear children. You don\u2019t get suddenly mature and it doesn\u2019t magically give you any ability to do anything better or understand things better.", "NTA your daughter could have asked for mom at any time. Please remove the mindset that it's a medical issue though, it's normal and natural and doesn't need any form of medical issue if the bleeding stops, there aren't large clots, mental health is good, minimal to no pain, etc.", "NTA. I can get where she's coming from and wanting to be involved but honestly what could she have done? You seem to have done a good job, had all your ducks ready and in a row so I'd say you did an amazing job. Especially being a dad when many dad's fail or just push it off on mom. \n\nGood job", "NTA. You handled it appropriately. She was out of town and not available. You offered the next best people - her aunt and your gf. You did your best.", "NTA.", "Well, you asked your daughter if she wanted to talk to your sister or partner, it would have been reasonable to include her mother in that list, so she had that option.\nAnd while I think it should have been your daughter\u2019s choice, it would have been nice if you had asked your daughter if it was ok for you to let her mother know.\nNOt TA for having prepared and supported your child, but it is in her interests that you are civil to her mother and don\u2019t create or encourage hostility or put your kid in the middle of awkward situations, and a quick text or call to her to let her know would have been appropriate and could have avoided the row, and would have cost you nothing.\n\nAlso, I think it is a bit different from most medical stuff but equally, most medical things are going to be things that it would be reasonable for you to keep her mother informed about.\n\nSo on balance, ESH. Your ex for making it all about her, and you for not considering that she might want to know and that telling her would make life easier for your daughter by limiting conflict that she is exposed to.", "NTA, parenting of a child is not a gender-specific activity.  When my eldest wanted to get a bra - she went to her dad (I was travelling for work as well).  He took her shopping, and all was well, and I was proud of them both.  1 - that my (now) ex would do anything for our daughter, and 2 - that my daughter knew she could go to her dad for anything.  Your ex is the AH for thinking only she can parent a female child.", "Yta telling her to  ask the woman your seeing over her mom. You could have offered to let her phone mom. I'm happy you read up and handled it but yeah. It's something you should have gotten her to call mom about", "YTA.  While you did nothing wrong in having the conversation with your daughter, you should have offered her to speak to her mother about this.  Not your sister and the woman you are seeing, her mom.  If she asked to speak to your sister instead, that would have been fine.  You also should be keeping the other parent informed about what is going on with your children.  She should have been told this happened because it will likely occur in her home at some point.  I think you are allowing your bitterness to exclude her as a parent.  You have to love your children more than you hate your ex.  Facilitating and encouraging a healthy relationship with both parents is part of that.", "Slight YTA - Some of your comments keep pressing upon the issue that the mom was so many miles away.  Yes your daughter could have contacted her mother, but the way you speak about the mother makes me think the daughter did not want to contact her because of how YOU react to the mom.  I mean I get it, horrible ending to the marriage, etc. but that is still her mother.  Do you speak ill of the mom in front of your children?  Could be why she did not want to reach out.  You did what you could, you did well as a dad but I think you still should have let your ex know.", "YTA. It's not clear from the post if the mother was available by phone, but if she was, surely you could have provided your daughter with the boxes of stuff, encouraged her that is was normal and then let her speak with her mom to get the rest of the stuff. If not, there's no reason whatsoever other than your bitterness towards your ex (whether deserved or not) to not give her a headsup on what is going on.", "Soft YTA only for not telling her. Even though you\u2019re the primary parent, she\u2019s still a parent, and it\u2019s important for her to know about milestones like this when they happen on your watch. Even if she\u2019s petty enough to not do the same, you\u2019re the one setting a good example for your kids.", "YTA. I get it your marriage ended badly but you still have to coparent. Your ex their mom had a right to hear this info from you when it happened. She might have wanted to check in an have a talk with her and mom needs to be ready for visitation time too.", "YTA, you did it out of bitterness and purposefully didn\u2019t mention her when suggesting your daughter talk to someone else, that\u2019s manipulative.", "I mean I'm going to say YTA becaude you didn't even suggest her mom as a female she could talk to. It seems like you are actively trying to alienate her and harm her relationship with her mother. That's not beneficial to your child.", "Going with yta. Instead of talking about to your ex HER mother you decided to talk to your own mom.  I would be pissed too.  As a mom whose has to co parent with my abusive ex I would still have discussed it with him because he is my child\u2019s other parent.", "YTA.", "Slight YTA. It should be your daughter's choice which woman she talks to. It sounds like you made the decision to put your sister between your daughter and her mother, not daughter. \n\nMy YTA is tempered by your ex's view that this is about her. Her milestone moment. Your account of this makes it seem that ex looks at this as being about he, not about her daughter.", "I\u2019m going YTA. My mom wasn\u2019t around much, but she is still the only person I would have wanted to talk to about this as a child. Even though you say you didn\u2019t do it on purpose your entire story about the wife getting attention even though she\u2019s not really attractive reeks of anger and was not really relevant to the story except to be critical. \n\nI think how you handled the part with your daughter was fine, but I think you didn\u2019t call her mother on purpose.", "YTA for the way you talk about the mother of your child", "ESH. Or at least you and your ex wife - I don't have any issues with your daughter or your sisters behavior. You suck because you're not sharing important milestones and things that happened during your time with her mother, and she sucks because apparently she's been allowing this up until it came to something she had strong feelings about....and possibly doing the same thing with things that happen on her time? (Unclear)\n\nYou are coparenting. You need to get over whatever bitterness exists enough to communicate with her about your kids, because THEY need that. It isn't about you guys it's about your kids. \n\nI also think you are being slightly obtuse to pretend you don't know that getting your period is typically a huge milestone shared by mothers and daughters, but I do think the bigger issue is that you seen to really think this is an effective way to co parent.\n\nEDIT: I've decided to change my verdict to NTA because I realized I wasn't actually judging the conflict at hand. I do not think you are the asshole for handling your daughters period yourself, though I do think you are being a bit disingenuous by pretending you didn't anticipate her being annoyed or you didn't know that that is often a mother Daughter milestone.", "YTA you cut your wife right out of the people your daughter could talk to for support. This is a major milestone and you took it away from your daughter. \n\nI dont care about the animosity between you and your ex wife.  I dint care of she slept with all 2000 men on that site. Thats irrelevant. That is a you and her issue. But you need to move past it. \n\nYou both need to pull your heads out of your asses and start being grown ups and learn to be civil towards each other. Not saying that you and her need to be best friends. But seriously stop trying to remove your wife from milestones your children have..\nThat alone makes you a AH", "YTA: Also a man but it seems like that is kind of an important thing that you should have assumed she would want to know about.  The only reason not to is if you thought she was going to engage in some sort of psychologically abusive behavior.  From your description it seems like the issues with your ex are between you and her, not her and your kids so I'm assuming that's not the case.\n\nI just want to make it clear in case people are misunderstanding me.  My read of the OP is that he is an asshole because he didn't tell his wife out of spite and it's a shitty thing to use your children as a means of hurting your ex.    It seems somewhat obvious that this is something a fair number of people would want to know in his ex's position and that his decision not to do so was one of malice rather than ignorance or a concern for his daughters well being.", "YTA. This is a major milestone and was absolutely worthy of a call to your wife, if for no other reason than your daughter might have wanted her mother's support. You said \"it was a child medical thing\" so you shouldn't have had to include your ex - I don't understand that. Are you saying if your daughter broke her leg you wouldn't tell her mother?", "YTA. As a woman, I honestly think it was disrespectful to both your ex and your daughter. Getting your period is an embarrassing, intimidating, intimate thing in a girl's life. By the sound of it, you handled it well as the primary caregiver, BUT you should have talked to her mother about it too. Right away. You are CO-PARENTING. You have to put aside any bitterness between you two for the health of your kids. By the way you talk about your ex, you sound quite disrespectful. \n\nWho knows how your daughter feels about all this - she may have been too embarrassed to bring it up to her mom on her own and this could've distanced their relationship even further. Her mom is her closest female relative to whom she probably feels most comfortable talking about these things. You did a disservice to her by thinking it \"wasn't important\" to share the information with her own mother - who she probably spends quite a bit of time with. Your daughter needs you two to communicate important moments like these to each other so that she doesn't feel like she's being put in the middle of a nasty relationship. Her mom deserved to know.\n\nI would have been furious and hurt as her mother if my ex didn't share that information.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm advocating sharing important information at what is happening at each other's houses with your coparent, and I'm speaking on the whole as this is the OPS general way of behaving according to his post. \n\nIMO we all carry our own baggage and it makes us see things different. With that little glimpse into your history I can see why you would strongly lean on the don't share info side. I personally had coparents that refused to talk to each other and consistently put me in a position of messenger, and frequently I missed out on important things because of their lack of communication - and that's why my immediate reaction to this post was that coparents should be sharing with the other parent what happened while they were in their household because it's difficult to parent without large chunks of information. \n\nTbh I'm on the fence about if a coparent should share the period thing specifically. I don't think i have strong feelings either way. On one hand i can see legitimate health and safety reasons why both parents should know - whether or not you menstruate is pretty medically important (for ex. I had a friend who used to faint constantly and had chosen not to tell her parents or doctor that she had begun mensturating. It took them near a year to determine she was anemic and her symptoms were exacerbated when she was menstriating. A simple iron supplement fixed the problem and may have prevented her from missing so much achool she was held back that year) and any parent having sole responsibility for a kid at any given time should know important medical information, however I also see your argument for bodily autonomy. I think I lean on the side of it being highly situational. \n\nAs I've restated a few times though, my insistence that co parents should be sharing important goings on that happen when the other parent is not around is much more general than this specific question and I stand by it.", "If you read my comment I don't really have issues with the period specifically, more the idea that he doesnt communicate issues and milestones or really at all with his coparent.

But she is ten, and generally speaking people understand that ten year Olds don't make the right decisions and need their parents help.

Awesome!\u201d* There is ***nothing*** great about that!! \n\nThe milestone thing is hold over from some religious bullshit about a young girl \u201cbecoming a woman\u201d I think. It\u2019s gross. Right up there with people watching others consummate a marriage. It\u2019s so cringe. Yes she can technically get pregnant but let\u2019s not focus on that because she\u2019s just a child with more bullshit she has to worry about.

It matters that the parent handled the situation without causing any undo embarrassment.", "All the research in the world doesn't tell you what it's really like to have a period.", "> While I can sort of get her reaction on a primitive level\n\nMy husband had primary custody of my stepdaughter.  When she got her period she absolutely dreaded telling her mother.

My stepdaughter was much older though, almost 15 when she started.", "That's not what I've gotten from these comments. It seems like OP is outwardly and obviously resentful of his ex, not that the ex is bitter and it doesn't seem like OP even offered her mom as an option, a fact that her daughter is not likely to press on considering OP's resentment.\n\nI also really want to know what the fuck happened because framing \"1 of a dozen women in a camp of 2,000 men\" doesn't sound like a situation that the vast majority of women would be comfortable with in regards to \"male attention\". In fact, it sounds like an environment that sounds prone to the sexual exploitation of women and I'm really curious to know if OP considers being a victim the same as cheating.... I dunno.\n\nThe framing of that statement is giving me some real bad vibes.", "That's nonsense. If the girl even visits her mom at all it might be relevant but before that not really. Mom should be able to figure it out and there's no reason why the daughter couldn't say it herself. You're reaching pretty hard to even find something to equivocate to ex's behavior.", "I'd actually agree with this 100% if that's what the mother was upset about, and OP had left her high and dry because the daughter was going over to her mother's and he'd not said anything. Instead she was more devastated about being \"robbed\" of a mother daughter moment. \n\nShe needs to get a grip, the kids with him. She still found out and has time to prepare. Also letting the daughter tell her mother I thought was quite a nice touch.", "This doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. He has primary custody. If and when his ex has the kids, it sounds like it\u2019s a fairly uncommon occurrence- at the most it\u2019s one week out of every three. Why does that require him to tell her IMMEDIATELY? She obviously found out when she talked to her daughter that weekend, because her daughter decided to tell her. If she was going to have her daughter at her house he could have told her in advance of that - but she found out well before that would have happened anyway, because he wasn\u2019t hiding the information from her or telling his daughter she wasn\u2019t allowed to tell her mom. His daughter is clearly in contact with her mother (because she\u2019s the one who ended up telling her) so if she felt she needed her in that moment she could have reached out. Ex is just upset that she wasn\u2019t there for that moment - which I still think is kind of weird. Periods can be uncomfortable to talk about and the last thing I wanted when I got my first one was to talk to any adult about it. I talked to my mom because I knew I had to ask someone what to do and she almost teared up with happiness and said \u201cyou\u2019re a woman now!\u201d.

However, I disagree about this not being the daughter\u2019s information to share. I get what you\u2019re saying about having appropriate products available, and that\u2019s definitely important. But I was in largely the same position as OP\u2019s daughter. I got my period while my dad was my custodial parent. I shared the information with him because it was relevant to our lives, but I chose not to share the information with my mother because I didn\u2019t have the type of relationship with her. To this day, I strongly respect and admire my dad\u2019s ability to differentiate between medical occurrences and medical emergencies. He let me decide when I was comfortable telling my mother and I think that had a huge positive influence in our relationship because it really taught me that my body and its experiences are mine. That meant everything when my entire world had been torn apart and nothing else was in my control.", " The daughter gets to decide who to tell.  Period.", "Idk telling other people about her having her period at all seems gross to me unless he asked her permission. I don't care that she's a child and this is her mom.

Double standards go both ways. It's a minor error of not getting a chance to talk with the Mom first. It's also ridiculous it's being referred to as a medical issue.

It's a parent-child medical issue.\"", "Actually, if dad got full legal custody then no, mom doesn\u2019t have a right to be involved in a medical issue unless daughter happens to tell mom about it - dad is not legally required to involve mom because mom does not legally have that right according to the custody agreement.", "I was looking for this every thing. There's also The topic of what the parents can agree on as \"kid appropriate products\". And yes, it's absolutely a mother- daughter thing, which was taken from mom. Great, aunt was available, but it's an intimate moment for a mother and daughter. How does mom feel about tampons? Pads? Cups? Disks? For a 10 year old? Not to mention there's going to be things that she'll experience because her mother's been through it. Maybe auntie has had the penultimate menstrual experience. Perhaps bio mom (and other women on her side) have experienced problematic periods. If bio mom still tracks hers, daughter may discover they have similar patterns. Her bond with her mother isn't for OP to control, any more than it is the other way around. \n\nJust because OP doesn't like bio mom doesn't mean that needs to be the daughter's problem. He needs to separate his animosity from his child's needs. It wouldn't be any different for a father deciding on circumcision,  taking his son for haircuts, or  son learn to pee standing up or getting his first wet dream.

I absolutely dearest the idea that this should only be a mother/daughter activity, that tampons/pads should be hidden so the boys won\u2019t see, refusing to let Dads be a part of the discussion (as long as the child is comfortable), etc. We need to normalize periods; they\u2019re a part of life that\u2019s absolutely unavoidable. \n\nMy dad would take me for supplies (including chocolate!) and I felt no shame in letting him know if I happened to be on my period or was experiencing terrible cramping. I felt supported and safe through the process, and he was actually a LOT better than my mom. Girls deserve to have support and not be made to feel like lepers. Parents shielding their boys from this like some dirty little secret are setting their kids up for failure. Should the boy happen to be straight, he will ABSOLUTELY be dealing with this in the future, and it\u2019s mom and dad\u2019s responsibility to teach him it\u2019s normal and how to support the women in their lives.

She's my daughter, so it's 'a me thing'\" made it sound like he would've expected her to tell him, but I think it was more him showing her that it's kinda fucked up for her to expect him to tell her while knowing that she wouldn't have told him. \n\nBut honestly?

Which again...a 9/10 year old is still a child having to grapple with a significant life change and adding the pressures of womanhood to that seems odd.

Kid's are not dumb and are able to pick up on parental resentment and people are very bad at separating their actions from their feelings, so I doubt that OP doesn't actually outwardly express that resent to their daughter.\n\nAlso, once again, I would love to focus more on the way that OP phrased her ex and the environment she was in because it sets off alarm bells in my head.

Additionally, I think it's pretty clear that he doesn't view a \"first period\" as like this milestone that needs to be celebrated or bonded over.

I can\u2019t help but wonder if the daughter would have preferred to talk to mom, but is afraid to do so because of how dad may react.

She\u2019s 10, yes, she\u2019s at the age where she can start thinking for herself, however, she\u2019s still a child who might not learn things properly unless she\u2019s actually physically interacting with something.

Frankly his ex wife is unhinged for expecting him to let their daughter deal with it on her own until her mom could be there or could talk to her. Starting menstruating is a very scary time for many girls, and she may have been slightly embarrassed having to talk to her dad, but he handled it correctly, going as far as seeing if she wanted to talk to someone else to make sure she understood everything.

I definitely would have felt excluded also and been upset if my ex not only didn't tell me but also sent our daughter to his sister to ask questions rather than me.", "welllll, not exactly. there is enough variance in menstrual cycles especially for the first several years that giving your coparent a heads up that your daughter has started her period so she knows to keep pads/tampons on hand in case it happens during her custody time is important. it doesnt have to be a huge thing though just a quick heads up about necessary sanitary supplies", "Yeah.  I know every person is different,  but at least when I got my first period, I wanted things to stay normal. I even turned down my parents offer to skip the first day that I had it", "Yup. Mom never talked about it with her obviously. If she had, the kid would have already known what to expect and would have said something along the lines of \"thanks dad, but I don't need the tutorial video/I don't have questions. Mom already explained everything. Can you run to the store and grab me a pack of pads?\".\n\nI remember my mom sitting me down one or two years before I had my period and explaining everything. When my time came all I had to do was ask my mom to grab me one of her pads that were kept in a different bathroom and to please go to the store later during the day to buy me pads cause hers where too big for me. \n\nHad OP's ex wanted this to be a mom-daughter \"event\", she could have prepared her kid before her period first arrived.", "This is what I think. If the mother had actually had the talk with her, then I\u2019m sure the daughter would\u2019ve wanted to reach out. That also goes for how close they are or aren\u2019t. If the mother is working two weeks on and one week off, that probably means she goes two weeks without hearing to much from her. That\u2019s a busy schedule which makes it hard to get close to someone if you\u2019re a kid. I also know many mothers do not have the talk with their daughters, even though they know in the back of their mind, that their daughters are getting close to that age.       \nI have a high school friend whose daughter was supplying many girls at school with period products and teaching them how to use them because the girls got their periods and they were too embarrassed to tell their own mothers! These girls had never had the talk and didn\u2019t know how to use any of the products. My friend was so proud of her daughter for helping other students during a very embarrassing moment in their life. Although she said that the girls did need to tell their mom\u2019s because it was getting expensive. Lol. I personally remember getting my first period at school and being absolutely mortified even though I had been warned it could happen anytime.", "He didn\u2019t say that Mom keeps the kids on her week off, or even has set visitation. In another comment he says:\n\n> My wife thought that I was making a mistake pushing for divorce and tried to break into my house after she had taken her stuff and moved out. After she tried to pry the door open and the alarm went off I got a restraining order. She tried again and had to be escorted away by cops. She did this when the kids were home the second time.", "It's a monthly cycle, it can wait a couple of days for her mother to be informed. \n\nAlso if its important to mum then she would have/ought to have been over this with daughter already. My daughter currently 9 has already had several demonstrations with period products and other puberty related discussions. The aim is to give her confidence so she can handle it when she discovers it as I might not be there (work, school, away trips).\n\nIf my daughter started her period whilst visiting Grandma for a few days then I'd expect to hear about it when I pick her up not immediately and I'd also expect to hear it from my daughter not grandma (goes for both grandmas, aunts, etc).", "I would have to disagree with this. As someone who was raised by parents who weren't together, I was always given the option if what things I would like to tell each parent. Infact, my dad never knew about my periods until I was about 16.\nOf course, it depends on the circumstances and relationships, OP was not obligated to tell his ex, for all she knew, their daughter wanted to tell her herself.", "This isn\u2019t making her a \u201cgo-between.\u201d This isn\u2019t something between mom and dad, this is the daughters business. It\u2019s letting the girl be the owner of her own body. That\u2019s her information to share, not anyone else\u2019s. As far as having products available, pads and tampons are highly portable! How hard is it to bring a few to moms when she visits? That\u2019s what my daughter does when she goes to her dads on the weekend. This whole take is a ridiculous stretch.", "I absolutely agree with ESH. I\u2019ll also add that OP comes across as quite petty, which for me coloured what they stated about the situation.\n\n(1) For absolutely no reason, OP had to put in their post that their ex-wife is not conventionally attractive, but she works somewhere with a high male:female ratio, and so was highly desirable as one of only few options:\n\n\u201cAnd while I always thought she was beautiful it wasn\u2019t as easy for other people to see. However when you are one of a dozen women in a 2,000 man work camp you get a lot of attention. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about that.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m open to being corrected if I\u2019m interpreting that wrong, but WOW. I can empathize if this is hinting at an affair, but what a strange thing to add.\n\n(2) OP offered his current partner and sister as options for his daughter to call for support, but not his daughter\u2019s mom. I\u2019ve seen other comments that OP\u2019s daughter knows the mom exists, but she\u2019s 10 - she\u2019ll pick up on mom not being an option, and may not feel comfortable speaking up if she does happen to want mom.", "I was NTA until the part where he specifically excluded mom from the options of women she could talk to.", "I\u2019m really surprised that I had to scroll pretty far to see this. \n\nAs you have said, mom needs to know to have ample age appropriate supplies for her, and the daughter should not be a contact liaison.\n\nAlso, as much as my dad and man partner sympathize with me for the struggles. As far as I know, and this is from my personal experience, my mom and I have very similar cycles including irregularity, PMS symptoms(not everyone experiences this the same) and ovarian cysts which typically come from ovulating. I recently got off of birth control and my pms symptoms are just like when I first started. \n\nNot to disregard that OP did provide a trusted woman\u2019s perspective for his daughter to talk to, that\u2019s awesome.\n\nBut we didn\u2019t hear about what the daughter wants or needs.\n\nMom definitely sucks for missing the point, but she could be flabbergasted that OP didn\u2019t think this milestone was significant enough.", "But mom should know she\u2019s getting to that age anyway. She\u2019s a woman herself and probably still has products on hand. Plus she knows when she started. I\u2019ve seen to many women with their heads in the sand about dealing with their daughter\u2019s getting their periods. My own friend\u2019s daughter was supplying multiple girls in her grade period products and teaching them how to use them!!!! because their own mom\u2019s didn\u2019t have the talk with them and they were to embarrassed to tell their own mom! So yeah they are co-parenting and he should have told her but if mom had had the talk with her then she would have been the person she would have requested. I doubt dad withholds phone calls to their mom.", "I can't believe I had to scroll down so far to get to this answer.  I fully agree with you, the mother should've been notified by the father ASAP, not by the child later.

I can tell you what it says if you missed it.", "My dad was the best about periods. I always felt comfortable telling him I was out of pads, needed Midol, or even how bad my symptoms were that day. If I mentioned I was feeling bad, he would come by my room with a heating pad, hot tea, and a chocolate bar within the hour.\n\nMy mom was helpful with the anatomical logistics, but my dad\u2019s attitude towards it is what empowered me to not feel ashamed about my period in future relationships.

He\u2019s the one making his feelings clear & showing hatred for the mother infront of his child, therefore being a terrible co-parent. I don\u2019t find it a bonding moment, but it\u2019s an important moment to educate and be there for them because it can be scary and confusing.

My mom celebrated with me and made up a cute little ceremony and got me ice cream. You\u2019re not technically in the wrong, but you\u2019re coming off petty and exclusionary, or at least just dismissive of how your ex-wife feels about this. It\u2019s valid for her to want to have been informed. At least hear her.", "I harbor ill will toward my ex who cheated.  But I still find OP's word choices very odd.  He basically states that he thought the fact that his wife was ugly would guarantee loyalty and that's....a really odd take on it.  Almost like he is saying he did her a favor by taking on an ugly woman and look what he got for his sacrifice.  It's....really cringe.", "Yep, and OP shared further downthread that the ex-wife broke into his home (with the children present) requiring the police to be called; he was granted a restraining order. \n\nSo, she not only cheated, it sounds like she kept the post-separation drama burning extra hot.  No wonder the kids do not run to her with new info immediately.", "Still makes no sense..if she wasn\u2019t trying to get attention why tell us that she got attention??\n\nAt any rate, I\u2019m sorry for whatever happened to your marriage and I sincerely hope you\u2019re in a better place.\n\nI hope you\u2019ll encourage your daughter to include her\nMom in the village of women for support", " I think he is trying to justify why he hates her by claiming he was a good husband and thought she was beautiful even though no one else did and she went off and whored around on him as soon as other men paid attention to her but they only did it because she was the only one there so it didn't matter to them that she was actually not very attractive. It sounds like he treated her like he was god's gift to her and she wasn't worthy and is bitter she had the audacity to either leave him or step out on him. Whatever the case may be your right totally not relevant to what he is ranting about but it does seem that he has always been TA lol", "You ain\u2019t kidding, I\u2019m so happy you got that impression. \n\nAnd I still believe that lingo was meant to save me from embarrassment, not him.

She's mad he didn't tell her. If anything she also needs to be in the loop about what's happening to her daughter medically.", "Yeah, I can see your point. In that case I suppose we need INFO \n\nHow often is daughter visiting mom, and for how long? Is this likely to be something she\u2019ll need to navigate while there? \n\nAlso, how has mom previously addressed puberty with daughter (ie discussions about changing body shape, growing body hair, the future start of menstruation\u2026) If she\u2019s not made any effort previously to be part of the conversation, and only wants to be now that menstruation is actively occurring, she\u2019s even more of TA than I thought.", "OP already said they have a bad relationship, and it's not like the daughter doesn't know about mom. Now, if the daughter wanted to call mom but dad refused then that's an asshole move.", "She could have gone to her mom she chose not to.", "I bought a fire extinguisher for my kitchen. Does that mean I want a fire to break out in my kitchen? And that's not even something that's inevitable.", "The way I read it is: OP thought his ex was pretty, but others don't think shes pretty until there's only a handful of women for thousands of men to choose from. \n\nWhich still doesn't clear up whether she cheated or kept getting male attention.  Only that OP didn't think others found her attractive until their options were limited.", "I read OP's post to maybe mean his ex gets flirted with at work and she welcomed the flirtation. Maybe she didn't actually cheat, but getting attention from men outside of her relationship may have given her an ego boost so she just didn't discourage it. I can understand why that would bother a partner.", "I wondered that also.", "Also the comments on her looks.

As well, I'm not so sure the majority of women think that way either.\n\nBut that's why we have this sub right? You get to read about spoken words and actions that you never ever gave much thought to and didn't think was a big deal.

I'm learning a bit from this one.", "I just want to point out that his ex tried to force entry to his house 2 times, one where his kids where there. He had to get a restraining order against her.

Your dad sounds amazing.  \n\nMy dad was similar. Family members used to send us their troubled kids to our ranch to \u201cstraighten them up\u201d over summers because my dad had a knack for setting rules and making us do chores. Also, if he had his eye on you, you weren\u2019t getting in any trouble without him knowing. He once caught one of my brothers skipping class because he spotted his truck on the highway from a freaking *helicopter*. Dad was testing an Apache with a pilot and had the presence of mind to keep an eye out for kid trouble in the middle of work. Legendary.   \n\nBut when his beloved cat died, he wept, and when his dog died, he *wrote a poem for the dog*. He used to take clandestine trips to the city to visit me on his own when he was worried about me, just to lay eyes on me and watch me eat. He never told Mom. He\u2019s the man who taught me how to tame the many abused cats who were dropped off at our house over the years by people who knew we took in cats, and he was the man who had an emotional attachment to every tree on our land.

She was absolutely disgusted with me. Angry.  I didn't know why. I honestly thought I had cancer or something. She did not buy me pads. She literally rammed a super plus tampon into me. I'll never forget the disgusted look on her face or how bad it hurt.  I didn't know to take it out...or how. So, I told the school nurse a day or two later. If it wasn\u2019t for her, I'm not sure what would have happened to me.", "*\u201cShe called me an asshole for excluding her from a milestone in her daughter's life.

It was a mother daughter thing and that I took it away from her.\u201d*\n\nThat alone is all the proof needed. It wasn\u2019t about her not being included, she got mad at OP for taking care of the situation himself instead of letting her, when she wasn\u2019t even there. While he probably should have mentioned it, I highly doubt \u201coh I better call my ex about this\u201d was the very first thing he thought of, whereas his daughter might have been excited to let her mom know she was starting on the journey to becoming a woman. Situations like this are not a strictly mother-daughter only thing. It\u2019s a parent-child thing that needs to be taken care of when it happens. The parent or guardian in charge has a responsibility to the kid to explain what\u2019s going on, what it means, ways they can help themselves if they need to, and to extend some helping hand without the kid feeling embarrassed or ashamed. The ex wife acting like it was *her responsibility alone* is the problem.", "I felt like that was a trailing story, it had nothing to do with parenting.", "Yeah.

So, you did many things right but you didn't inform mom as you should've. It's a simple part of co-parenting and you limited the options you offered your daughter regarding who she could talk to or ask questions. You are excluding mom regarding a critical milestone and not encouraging communication with her when your daughters will have questions. This isn't about a blubbering mother daughter moment but no one who hasn't had a period can understand what it is like to have one or will know everything to expect.

After all, the first period it's a very personal milestone and if your kid don't want to share it or your husband (in this case, you, OP) don't seem worried about it (which I recommend, treat periods as normal things, because it's normal!), then don't make a big fuss.", "Nta.

I don't understand why there are some women out there who get all mad when they \"miss out\" on that \"mother-daughter moment\" that comes with the daughter's first period because their daughter's father was the one present when the period started and handled the situation. Like what did you want the father of your daughter to do? Just leave her to freak out over what's happening, make her feel like a freak for something totally natural happening to her, leave her in dirty underwear and pants without some type of menstrual product (which is totally unsanitary, by the way, and I say that as a woman who has been dealing with periods for the past 17 years) just so mom could have that big moment with her? When I got my first period my mom was home with me all day (she was a stay-at-home-mom and I was homeschooled) but I didn't tell her and my dad that I was bleeding until that night and she didn't make a big deal out of it and neither did my dad which I'm thankful for. My mom and I went shopping for pads the next day because we didn't have any in the house (my mom had a hysterectomy three years prior to this) so I just dealt with panty liners which worked because my flow was very light. And if my mom hadn't been there when I finally was like \"Maybe I should tell them that I'm bleeding because what if something's wrong with me\" I know for a fact that my dad would have been totally calm and handled everything well because he is an awesome dad and has never had any issues with getting pads for me or chocolate or whatever else I need for my periods and he was the same way with my mom when she still had her periods. Also, if your daughter was able to contact her mom about her getting her first period but she chose not to? That says a lot about how your daughter feels about her relationship with her mother.", "NAH. You handled things really well. No issues there. That being said, it actually IS important for your daughter\u2019s mother to know that she started her period. She\u2019s 10. She\u2019s still in elementary school. She has no way of getting sanitary products on her own if she\u2019s at her mom\u2019s and needs them, mom would need to know. My parents are divorced, and I got my period at 11. My mom told my dad, not because it was a \u201ccelebration\u201d or \u201cmilestone\u201d, but because he would need to start stocking sanitary products, and may have to run out and get them for me sometimes, along with painkillers for cramps, and some empathy if I was moody. It\u2019s something a parent absolutely should have on their radar if it happens at an elementary school age. I think your ex\u2019s reasoning came across as stupid, periods are just something that happens, and they\u2019re certainly not exciting, but yeah, as a parent, you definitely need to know that about your 10 year old child.", "You are an amazing father, not an asshole.  When my daughter was 10, she was at her dad's house while my second husband and I were on a short weekend trip.  My very modest daughter had seen \"the film\" at school but only being 10 years old she was still scared when she got her period.  She finally told her dad what had happened, and she had stuffed bath tissue in her underwear and was STILL bleeding through it and through her pants.    Her dad was from a family of all boys but still knew he had to do something, so he called me and asked me for brand and style recommendations (tampon or tampax).   I advised tampax for her first period since few 10 yr olds are familiar enough with their vagina to know when a tampon is placed \"correctly\" but if she wants to try a tampon then purchase both.  He also put her on the phone with me.  She was pretty upset but glad she finally told her father rather than try to hide it for 2 days.  She had also bled through her second pair of underware and jeans.  I was upset myself about how heavy her period was, and almost told my husband we were going leave now!  But instead, I asked her if she wanted to go over to grandma's until we would get home about 9 pm and she thought that was a great idea.    In the end - she got the \"mess\" cleaned up at her dad's and selected a tampax.  He also took her back home to put on another pair of underware and pants.   Then my ex took her to my mom's house and by the time we got back in town my mother and daughter were both at my aunt and uncle's house playing monopoly!  She was winning and in great spirits.   The next day I called my ex and told him that he handled this so well and I was very grateful for it.   I also passed on our daughter's words of praise of her dad because she was so suprised that he knew just what to do!     \nI'm not sure how I would have felt if my EX had not called me.  He could have called his mother instead but luckily, he and I have a better relationship divorced than we did when we were married, plus he is a bright man, and I knew I could totally trust his judgement.   So, I like to think I would have been OK if he had not called so I could \"share the milestone\" with our daughter too.  I really wasn't the mushy type of mother.  What's funny is that my mother had told both her sister and her sister's husband about it - so they both congratulated my daughter LOL.  My husband talked all the way home with her and his experience with his two daughters and 5 sisters.
