Her father was not much of a father. It always bothered me why no one held him accountable for his daughter...like he'd disappear for months and come back to shower Lana with money, then disappear again.\n\nAt first, it was great having her around. There were times where she would throw tantrums but we never paid attention to it that much, since my mom didn't think it was right to discipline a child that's not hers. She once even complained to grandma about Lana's behavior but grandma said as her aunt, she had to take care of Lana till her mother came back.\n\nAnyways, as more and more time went by, Lana started getting worse and throwing more tantrums and I'd warned her many times not to disrespect my mom since she was taking care of her out of her own pocket. She'd even make constant comparisons between my mom and her parents, saying her parents were better, even though they literally did nothing for her except throw money at her. Eventually, Lana's mom returned, took her to live with her but a month later, she returned her because she couldn't handle Lana's tantrums.\n\nI wanted to complain that she's not my mother's responsibility but my mother said I shouldn't intervene in these matters. Lana continued with her disrespectful behavior and yesterday it got so bad that she started vandalizing the house, throwing stuff, banging doors, messing up the kitchen and bathroom, attempting to even mess up my room but I wasn't having it. \n\nI went to my mother to speak to her about Lana and I found her sitting on her bed, crying, not knowing what to do with Lana as she continued to mess up the house. I got fed up that moment, dragged Lana out of the house kicking and screaming and locked her outside with all her luggage and called both her parents to come get her. My mom tried to stop me but I told her I wasn't going to listen to her this time. Her parents came, furious that I kicked their daughter out.\n\nI finally let out all the things I've been itching to say to them in regards to their horrible parenting, adding that I want them to pay for everything Lana broke in my mother's house or else I'd press vandalism charges. They tried to reason with my mother but I told them to leave my mother alone. They eventually left with Lana and I went back in to console mom.\n\nAs of today I'll be emailing them all the stuff their daughter broke and expecting them to pay for it. My family members called me to tell me that I shouldn't have done because it's an \"adult issue\" and I just told all of them to go to hell.\n\nBut now that I've calmed down, I'm not sure if kicking Lana out the way I did was morally right and maybe should have taken a more calmer approach. but I believe I did what needed to be done.

You seem to be the only responsible adult in this situation.", "Lana's parents were both near enough that they were able to come pick her up right away.\n\nWhy aren't they keeping *their own child* under their roof?\n\nYou are NTA, but even though she's not a pleasant child, I feel bad for Lana.  \n\nHer own parents dumped her.  Your mother and grandmother had some screwed-up notions about \"not disciplining someone else's child,\" which helped create an out-of-control teen.   \n\nIf her lack of self-control was never corrected, and always brushed away, it is not surprising that she continues to throw tantrums.  But now it is scarier because she is getting stronger and more destructive.\n\nYou weren't wrong to be completely fed up with her wrecking the house, and putting a stop to it.\n\nThere's probably no happy ending to this story.  But at least your home is safer.", "You\u2019re NTA but everyone else is. Lana is prob acting out because she\u2019s hurting. She def should have been disciplined the entire time though. I get why your mom felt awkward about it but she needed discipline/structure. Her parents 100% should have been responsible for her. But it\u2019s also not right for you to watch your mom go through that and you go through that. If they came to get her when you locked her out why didn\u2019t they before?? They need to take care of their child and def help your mom out because she was never her responsibility in the first place.", "NTA. Like another commenter said, it seems like you're the only mature adult in this situation. \n\nYour cousin is NOT you or your mother's responsibility or burden to carry. Sounds like alot of adults in your family need to step the fck up.\n\n(How can they say this is an adult issue when you're LITERALLY a legal adult?)", "You're 18, technically an adult. Rebuttal for the \"adult issue\" argument. \n\nI'm uncomfortable with the dragging her out part. But I understand. This was an extreme situation that called for extreme actions. And you did call her parents to pick her up. It's not like you left her out there by herself. Hopefully this will be a wake-up call to her parents to finally step up, be the parents that she deserves and maybe even get her some therapy. \n\nThe relatives who are calling you out should step in to help Lana's parents help Lana before it's too late. Lana needs her village right now. The adultier adults need to be there for her right now. She's not your mother's sole responsibility. Not when she has parents around. And if her parents need help, your mother shouldn't be their sole support system. Where is grandma in all this? Where were the other relatives when all this was happening? Lana's village has failed her. And as a result, Lana is struggling with a lot:\n\n1. Feels unloved and unwanted by her parents \n\n2. The lack of rules at your house hasn't helped. Plus your mum's lacklustre parenting. \n\n3. The money thrown at her by her parents to wash away their guilt at abandoning her. \n\nShe needs to feel like she belongs. It's hard for your mum do that for her if she's being treated like an unpaid nanny and not allowed to (or feels like she can't for some reason) fully parent her. And it seems like your mum is content to let people walk all over her. Lucky she has you to fight for her. Good on you for doing that. Your mum needs a break and so do you. Hopefully mum will learn to fight for herself. In the meantime, stand your ground. Be there for your mother. You're in for a rough ride. \n\nNTA\n\nEdited.", "NTA. I would discipline my nephew they need to learn you're the guest don't like it get out.", "NTA. \n\nBut....your cousin is clearly dealing with some shit.  She has two parents who abandoned her.  Idealizing parents who do that is a weird, and very common reaction.  I don't know why.\n\nCompassion would be great.  You're getting all the anger though, so that's hard.\n\nDefinitely hold her parents accountable for the damage.  They're the real assholes here.  Nothing you say or do them will be wrong (within reason).  Lana is acting out in immature ways, but she's a kid.", "Definitely NTA for wanting her gone i understand that but in the end it would have been your mother's decision what do do not yours and about the charges i don't know we're you live but sadly there probably won't be much they can do (I'm not even sure if you can press charges if the stuff belongs to your mom she has to do it) \n\n\nAn now the only thing I can't agree with the way you kicked her out wasn't right you should never you violence against a child I understand why you did but that's just not the right way \n\nOverall NTA i hope things work out for you and your mom and that you cousin gets help she obviously needs it", "NTA\n\nyou did the right thing. Hope you got pictures of everything that h3ll spawn broke. So that whenever another family member harasses you, send the pictures & ask them to help pay for the broken items.\n\nYour mom might try to convince you later on to let it go, bring back the d3mon, etc etc NO. PUT A STOP TO IT RIGHT AWAY.", "NTA - change the locks too.", "NTA.  It's way past time for Lana's parents to deal with her and her tantrums, destroying your house is just out of line.  Sounds like you're the only one who realizes this girl needs some serious behavioral issues addressed.", "NTA. Honestly, I would have called the cops. That girl was out of control, and could have been a danger to herself or others. She is underage so they would have brought her to the hospital, where she would have received a psych evaluation due to her behavior, which it sounds like she needs. Then her parents would have had to pick her up there and answer to both the police and medical professionals about their parenting (or lack there of). Her parents sound like actual trash and should be held accountable.", "NTA. Was that aggressive? Yes. Did she deserve it? Absolutely. You just showed the kid her future if she acted that way", "ESH.\n\n> There were times where she would throw tantrums but we never paid attention to it that much, since my mom didn't think it was right to discipline a child that's not hers. She once even complained to grandma about Lana's behavior but grandma said as her aunt, she had to take care of Lana till her mother came back.\n\nWell, *someone* fucking needed to parent Lana, and if everyone was determined to foist that responsibility on your mom, your mom should\u2019ve either felt empowered to step up and do that or demanded someone collect the kid herself.  As it is, you\u2019ve all now jointly created a monster who\u2019s acting out because she knows beyond a shadow of a doubt no one wants her.  Send the invoice for the physical damages, sure, but you honestly might want to call CPS and see if that results in getting Lana some *actual* help, because this whole situation is just an incredibly sad mess.", "Sounds like she has oppositional defiant disorder", "NTA, you are the most \"adult\" person in the whole situation", "NTA\n\nYou're 18 now so you're an adult, looks like you're well within your right to do something about the \"adult issue\". I honestly wouldn't blame Lana directly, her parents are to blame here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Mother was doing them a favor by taking in their child, and I don't think OP wrote anything about the parents paying the mother any sort of child support, so at the very least, they need to pay for what their child broke."]}
