Over time, my culinary skills have developed, and I have become quite adept at creating delicious and unique homemade meals. Many of my friends have tasted my creations and have expressed their love for my cooking.\n\n\nLately, my friends have been requesting that I cook for them on a regular basis, as they find my meals to be restaurant-quality and a delightful change from their usual routine. While I enjoy cooking for others and seeing them appreciate my food, it is quite time-consuming and requires a lot of effort on my part.\n\nIn light of this, I started charging my friends a small fee for the meals I prepare for them. I believe that my time, effort, and ingredients should be compensated for, just like any professional service. I am not trying to turn it into a full-fledged business, but charging a reasonable amount helps cover the costs and acknowledges the effort I put in.\n\nHowever, some of my friends are now upset and accusing me of being greedy and taking advantage of our friendship. They argue that since I enjoy cooking, I should be happy to share my food without expecting any compensation. They claim that charging them diminishes the spirit of friendship and turns our gatherings into business transactions.\n\nI am conflicted now, as I feel that my friends are being unfair in their expectations.

They are taking advantage of you to get free food. You're perfectly within your rights to charge for something that costs you time and resources. If they don't like it, they can have their restaurant quality meals at a restaurant. \n\nYou're right, your friends are being absolutely unfair and they are trying to guilt and manipulate you into agreeing to their, frankly, exploitative requests.", "INFO: the early part of your post reads like you\u2019re meal prepping for them, giving them meals to eat at their leisure.

That is obviously not okay. Think of it this way: your hobby is cooking, and their hobby is eating; why should you be the only one who pays?\n\nI remember when a friend of mine started getting into cooking as kind of a new hobby, and he wanted to use me as a guinea pig for his meals. We treated it as a mixture of me doing him a favour, and him doing me a favour, so I didn\u2019t bring wine or do him other favours as often as I would if he was already a good chef.\n\nYou are well past the point where your friends are doing you a favour. They are simply taking advantage of you, although it\u2019s possible they don\u2019t realise it.", "NTA\n\n> They argue that since I enjoy cooking, I should be happy to share my food without expecting any compensation\n\nThey're taking advantage of you to get a free nice meal", "If you cook and you invite them - it's expected that you will pay for it.

A step further would be to find new friends.", "NTA, they are asking you to cook for them on a regular basis. You did not invite them for dinner. They asked you to cook for them.

There are many things you need to consider. \n\nAre you blindsiding them with the fee or being up front and honest about compensation on the front end? Are you overcharging? How often is this happening? Were your friends taking advantage at all? \n\nMy suggestion would be to actually develop this into a side hustle. Print up menus and fees for 1-2, 3-5, 5+ meals and have your friends help you market this business. Only take orders that you want to take. When you test out new dishes on your friends, only charge for the ingredients but not the labor. In exchange, ask for their help getting the word out that you are taking orders as a personal chef. \n\nPlease follow your community\u2019s health ordinances. \n\nMy extended family finds and hires a personal chef every time we have a family reunion. It\u2019s cost effective and allows for all our dietary adjustments as well.\n\nNo one is the AH here. You and your friends just need to communicate to come to an agreement so that no one feels taken advantage of.", "ESH   \nCharging your friends, \"just like any professional service\" would indeed be a business transaction. On the other hand, I feel that \"friends\" expecting you to pay for everything, including the ingredients are rather greedy.

If they are still reluctant, well, then you you know who are not your friends.", "Info: In your country are you allowed to sell food that isn't prepared in commercially-accredited kitchens?", "Its a hard call. Since they are asking for it I would say compensation can be asked. Since you like too cook and it is basically a hobby I would not charge for the time but would see compensation for the food itself being pretty basic.\n\nI have a friend as well who loves to BBQ and he does it for us during the summer like 2-3 times. Only thing he asks is that we pay for the food that we eat cause meat costs a lot and we all find it totally fair.\n\nSo yeah I do not see an A in this story but I would explain too them that quality ingredients cost a lot and have them pay for that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
