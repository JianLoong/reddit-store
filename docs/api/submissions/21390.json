While I enjoy cooking for others and seeing them appreciate my food, it is quite time-consuming and requires a lot of effort on my part.\n\nIn light of this, I started charging my friends a small fee for the meals I prepare for them. I believe that my time, effort, and ingredients should be compensated for, just like any professional service.

They argue that since I enjoy cooking, I should be happy to share my food without expecting any compensation.

He won\u2019t take money, but we all know food is expensive so we all chip in for the ingredients and then we rotate the place so it\u2019s not always at his place.", "I\u2019m with OP. NTA. People that don\u2019t cook elaborate meals don\u2019t always realize the time, effort, and expense that goes into it. I used to have dinner parties at my house. For the less time and financially expensive meals, it wasn\u2019t a big deal. For the ones that were more expensive, I\u2019d let everyone know that if they could afford to pitch in some money, great. If not, they were still welcome. Most people pitched in $10-$20, which was fine.", "NTA and I wish I had a friend who would do this for me !  If they don\u2019t feel they should pay a small amount they are not your friends.  I wouldn\u2019t even be upset if my friend charged me full rate if their food was good", "What? They are literally the ones taking advantage of your friendship, asking for frequent free meals.

Do they also contribute things to the group that use an equitable amount time, skill, money, etc. in the \u201cspirit of friendship\u201d? \n\nThe main thing I see is that they ~requested~ more cooking from you. It\u2019s one thing when it\u2019s something you enjoy doing every once in a while on your own accord just to be nice. THAT would be in the spirit of friendship. But the nature of it changed when they requested more of your cooking. That\u2019s when it became a service. How often do you prepare these meals? Do you do it a certain number of days a week? Or by request?\n\nWith the info shared, I\u2019m leaning NTA. But it would be good to know if these friends do anything for the friend group that could be considered reciprocal effort.", "NTA\n\n>They claim that charging them diminishes the spirit of friendship and turns our gatherings into business transactions.\n\nI think it's perfectly reasonable if they always come to eat and treat you as their personal chef that there is some compensation. Specially since it was at their own request. Maybe they think it's too much? Since you aren't sharing how much you are charging it's hard to know. But if it's on a regular basis on their request the absolute minimum is paying for the ingredients and at least your part of the ingredients for the effort you are putting in.", "NTA. whenever one of my friends has cooked for me i\u2019ve always offered payment or to buy sides / pay for ingredients, etc. and on top of that i usually provide some sort of host gift.", "Oh my god they\u2019re not narcissists. Can we please stop using that word for anyone who is being inconsiderate? It\u2019s trivializing.\n\nThey\u2019re just plain ignorant, selfish, and greedy. Doesn\u2019t help that OP is referring to it as a \u201cfee\u201d and referring to their friends finding it \u201cdelightful.\u201d\n\nJust be upfront. \n\n\u201cListen, I love cooking for you guys sometimes, but it\u2019s a lot of work and costs a lot of money. There\u2019s a reason restaurants charge, and why my food more closely resembles what you would find in a restaurant. I wouldn\u2019t expect you to knit me things for free just because you like knitting. I would want to compensate you and support you because I\u2019m your friend. If you knitted me one thing once as a gift, I wouldn\u2019t ask for monthly gifts for free afterwards. I don\u2019t want to \u201ccharge\u201d you for my cooking.. but it would be nice if, on evenings you expect me to cook you all a meal, you all pitched in for the cost. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s being unreasonable, and I feel taken advantage of otherwise. If that doesn\u2019t seem reasonable to you, maybe we just do potlucks from here on out, and I\u2019ll bring whatever dish I feel like making, and not feel pressure for it to be fancy or expensive or labour intensive.\u201d\n\nIf they can\u2019t handle that, just stop cooking for them. If they don\u2019t want to hang out with you because of it, they were using you anyways and you need better friends.", "Yes, NTA, and a decent analysis, until the bold text.\n\nThis is the part where a person with experience of real courtrooms would strike your case out without even wasting the court's time on hearing the respondent's evidence, and then award costs to the respondents, on the basis that the burden of proof is on you, and you mistook your reddit post to be of value in assessing whether people have personality disorders.\n\nIt isn't. Expert evidence after in-person diagnosis is required. Not only have you never met these people, you have laughably insufficient material on which to base a diagnosis. And you aren't an expert. If you were an expert, you'd know that **this reddit diagnosis crap is absolutely fucking ridiculous, and it's harmful**.\n\nYeah, it's harmful. Ordinary people often can, and often do, behave poorly. Sending every other OP in this sub away with the impression that the asshole(s) in their AITA have personality disorders can encourage them to give up on relationships that might be relatively normal.\n\nGee, I wonder if there\u2019s any correlation between narcissistic personality disorder and pretending to be an authority on personality disorders on reddit?\n\nLet\u2019s see: \u201c*Grandiose sense of self-importance*\u201d? Check. \u201c*Arrogant, haughty behavior, or attitudes*\u201d? Check. \u201c*Requiring excessive admiration*\u201d? Check, for those just chasing upvotes. \u201c*Being interpersonally exploitative*\u201d? Check (giving advice about real people\u2019s lives on the basis of fake expertise to get upvotes on reddit seems exploitative to me).\n\nThat\u2019s 4 of the 9 diagnostic criteria in the DSM-5 met just from generalised profiling (with 5 required for diagnosis). Wow! I can\u2019t match the other criteria like that, but I\u2019m sure I could pull something out of my arse to \u2018match\u2019 at least one more criteria to specific redditors given a few comments to work with.\n\nWait\u2013I\u2019m sorry, I admit I didn\u2019t first address the general criteria for personality disorders. Of course, I probably had to admit it, because I\u2019m guessing you wouldn\u2019t know either way?\n\nOh! Come to think of it, I also admit I should\u2019ve checked whether you were using the Section II or Section III model. Or maybe you\u2019re more of an ICD-11 type of armchair psychologist? Or maybe you\u2019ve never read either?\n\nHmm, this is embarrassing... I quoted from the DSM-5, not the DSM-5-TR. Eh. I think it\u2019s okay, because I\u2019m pretty damn sure they didn\u2019t replace the DSM-5 text with \u2018*If you\u2019ve watched some Doctor Ramani videos (or similar) on YouTube, you can diagnose people with narcissistic personality disorder on the basis of a reddit AITA.*\u2019. That would be just be stupid. Right?\n\nNo doubt anyone tempted to downvote me for this will know that \u201c*Vulnerability in self-esteem makes individuals with narcissistic personality disorder very sensitive to \"injury\" from criticism or defeat. ... They may react with disdain, rage, or defiant counterattack.*\" So, react away, I guess.\n\nThe above quote is, of course, an associated feature supporting diagnosis, rather than one of the diagnostic criteria. But you don\u2019t know the difference, do you. Or do you? If you don\u2019t know, you shouldn\u2019t be making these reddit diagnoses. But if you DO know\u2026 you still shouldn\u2019t be making these diagnoses, because it\u2019s the kind of behaviour that psychologists consider unsound and unethical.\n\nJust stop, reddit.

It's perfectly normal for there to be some friction within a group while transitioning from getting free dinners to having to pay for them. Just let everyone adjust and it'll be fine.

If it's something simple like $5 per person, then I think this will all blow over with better communication and time. If OP is trying to put together an itemized accounting for every item used to make dinner, plus get paid minimum wage for the labor, then I would be closer to siding with the friends.
