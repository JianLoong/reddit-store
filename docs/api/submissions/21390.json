This would the equivalent of you always paying for their meals out because you have the money and enjoy going to nice places. Either they pay for something or don't cook for them at all.

You agreed, but you weren't the one that brought it up.", "These are users wtf", "They\u2019re *requesting* that you cook for them. Of course it\u2019s fine to ask them to pay.

That way, you\u2019re getting a free meal and a night off from every person you\u2019re cooking for, without any money directly changing hands, and you\u2019ll be back to a reasonable level of cooking/hosting that you might find more enjoyable. \n\nI do something similar for game nights, and while the money is never necessarily even, it\u2019s a lot of fun trying other people\u2019s favorites, and a lot easier than calculating what people owe each time.", "They are damaging the \"spirit of friendship\" by mooching off you and expecting you to buy the groceries, do the cooking and serve them.

Is it at cost?", "NTA! \n\nIf they were TRUE friends they would have NO problem with compensating you so you can move up and keep going.
