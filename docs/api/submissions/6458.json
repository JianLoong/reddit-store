I supported her through this as I had the money from recently selling a house. When she finished she was supposed to be super employable with two complimentary degrees.

She stayed there until we had our second child. She hasn\u2019t worked since. \n\nI have sold any hobbies equipment that has value and given up all my hobbies. The only discretionary spend we have left is her sport which we try to maintain to give her an outlet away from the kids. \n\nWhen she brought up going back to uni I simply asked how we could pay for it? We left it at that. \n\nSeparately we had discussed her going back to work  as well, which we agreed to. She did apply for 1 job but was unsuccessful in the final stage. \n\nWhen she told me she had applied and was successful I thought she was going to get the job so I wasn\u2019t upset financially, though a little miffed about not discussing it with me since it affects us both. She has told me that it has no cost because the fees can be deferred. She ignores any discussion about how we will afford childcare. \n\nThere was a $95 application fee that pushed us overdrawn and got us a $250 fine. \n\nWhen she didn\u2019t get the job she then said it was good because she could go to uni now. I got upset asking how we would pay for it? She told me I should be congratulating her because the process was really long and hard (4 months and several applications and interviews) and she \u201chad to do it by herself , because she couldn\u2019t tell me as I would tell her not to do it\u201d I agreed because we can\u2019t afford it and she called me jealous because I couldn\u2019t go to uni (because I couldn\u2019t afford it. She comes from money, I do not). I accused her of being a professional student with no intention to work. \n\nI have also suggested I be a SAHD and she go back to work as her qualifications would enable her to earn roughly double what I can but she refused because \u201ckids need their mother\u201d.

New job means she will be a newbie that will require to learn additional skills/application of her theoretical knowledge that universities not alleays provide, ask others for help. Also, it means she will have to earn/climb up the social position/status with new coworkers, i.e. start from the beginning, which she currently does not need to do if she goes back to university.
