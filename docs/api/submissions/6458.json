New job means she will be a newbie that will require to learn additional skills/application of her theoretical knowledge that universities not alleays provide, ask others for help. Also, it means she will have to earn/climb up the social position/status with new coworkers, i.e. start from the beginning, which she currently does not need to do if she goes back to university.

Let her go but you tell her she has to finance it on her own and she is responsible for finding child care and funding any extra costs going to uni will occur such as, child care, car expenses, books, ect and tell her no running to mummy and daddy either. \n\nYour money can only go so far. She isn't living in the real world time to let her take care of her own finances. Seems as if she sponged of mummy and daddy then yourself.", "NTA\n\nIt just isn't feasible with your income stream. And deferred payment isn't FREE education. That means you will pay for it later on probably with interest. This is nothing against the wife and wanting to pursue education, sometimes it just cannot be paid for. That is reality. \n\nI have a feeling that wife is maybe just afraid of leaving the comforts of academia/SAHM life for the real working world and is wanting a 3rd degree to prolong getting a job. But if you guys are hardly making it on what you are earning it is time to have a real, grown up discussion about wife's contributions and the reality that you are facing as a family of 5 on just what you earn and the kindness of your parents.", "NTA. I'm having trouble with the fact she accused you of jealousy for not being able to go to Uni when you have done nothing but support her in finances, practice, and through the sacrifice of your own hobbies. With all that sacrifice you could have sent yourself to Uni but chose to support her instead. I'm very curious (while trying not to speculate) as the what her end goal actually is.... is there an end goal?", "Definitely NTA. \n\nWhat use is education and degrees when one hadn't learnt even to be practical.

She needs therapy not another degree. NTA.", "NTA.  Your wife has no intention of using her degrees for work, she just wants to spend her time obtaining them.  She isn't acting as your partner, she's being selfish.  From your financial situation it sounds like she has no understanding.  You need to sit down with her and go over the finances together so she understands she's putting you at risk of being homeless if a $95 fee is so hurtful.", "NTA. Not sure what hobbies you had that you had to give up, collecting stamps? Hers is collecting degrees. She should give up her hobby too.", "OP, did your wife grow up rich?

She clearly loves being in school because it makes her feel like she is being productive at low stakes, but doesn\u2019t like actually working. She only applied for one job??

The goals and outcomes are nice and clear.  You have discretely defined assignments, they're evaluated explicitly, you get easily decipherable grades that generally correlate to your effort.

It is a super sore spot that people don't consider someone as grown up unless they reach the milestones of marriage and kids. The fifth degree person has grown up on her own terms, and has found a way to be a professional student without harming others.  She is not Peter Pan syndrome.

Work doesn't have that same structure - there's office politics, unclear deadlines/guidelines, and little feedback outside of the annual performance review.
