She is a SAHM currently but our third child is now three so she recently brought up going back to uni to get her masters. \n\nThe issue is we are broke. We have survived because of assistance from our parents when we are too far in the red. \n\nWhen we got together she had two degrees, Soon after we got together she quit her job to go back to uni. I supported her through this as I had the money from recently selling a house. When she finished she was supposed to be super employable with two complimentary degrees. She finished but went back to casual work again. We then had our first child and bought a house. This exhausted all our savings. \n\nWhen our baby was 8 months she went back to uni to do honours. Childcare pushed our budget but was just achievable. After honours she got part time work in the field, but her hours were so low that it didn\u2019t cover the cost of parking and childcare. She stayed there until we had our second child. She hasn\u2019t worked since. \n\nI have sold any hobbies equipment that has value and given up all my hobbies. The only discretionary spend we have left is her sport which we try to maintain to give her an outlet away from the kids. \n\nWhen she brought up going back to uni I simply asked how we could pay for it? We left it at that. \n\nSeparately we had discussed her going back to work  as well, which we agreed to. She did apply for 1 job but was unsuccessful in the final stage. \n\nWhen she told me she had applied and was successful I thought she was going to get the job so I wasn\u2019t upset financially, though a little miffed about not discussing it with me since it affects us both. She has told me that it has no cost because the fees can be deferred. She ignores any discussion about how we will afford childcare. \n\nThere was a $95 application fee that pushed us overdrawn and got us a $250 fine. \n\nWhen she didn\u2019t get the job she then said it was good because she could go to uni now. I got upset asking how we would pay for it? She told me I should be congratulating her because the process was really long and hard (4 months and several applications and interviews) and she \u201chad to do it by herself , because she couldn\u2019t tell me as I would tell her not to do it\u201d I agreed because we can\u2019t afford it and she called me jealous because I couldn\u2019t go to uni (because I couldn\u2019t afford it. She comes from money, I do not). I accused her of being a professional student with no intention to work. \n\nI have also suggested I be a SAHD and she go back to work as her qualifications would enable her to earn roughly double what I can but she refused because \u201ckids need their mother\u201d. She has no issue putting them into childcare though.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672832102, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1031g7f/aita_for_not_supporting_my_wifes_uni_application/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife sounds spoiled and you\u2019re right about her being a professional student.\n\nYou can\u2019t afford the children you have without financial assistance from your parents but she avoids working.

She may have blown the interview because she does not want to work.", "NTA if a child needs their mother and she can\u2019t work why would she go back to school? I say this as a mother of three with a professional degree. She needs to go to work and provide for her children if your family financial situation is that bad.

You have three children waiting on you to provide for them: clothing, lodging, schooling, all the bare essentials etc. Yet your wife wants to go back to her Master's at a time like this? How long can you afford to keep this up?\n\nLook at everyone out there in the open world. Most of them only require one (emphasis on ONE) degree of their choice in order to get a foot in the door. And that isn't even essential if job applicants have successfully honed their skills at learning a trade.\n\nIt's not about how many degrees you have, it's about how you pitch yourself to employers on what you can do. Your wife can go on to pursue engineering degrees, liberal arts degrees and then finish off in Culinary School. Yet none of that is going to matter if she doesn't know how to pitch herself. Because she will create that endless loop and find herself walking about in a paradox.", "INFO are you have had a real conversations with her? Does she not understand by her not working to build up a savings/household expenses, she\u2019s hurting the family?\n\nNo she can\u2019t go back to her comfortable school, where she\u2019s happy.  She needs a J.O.B. That message needs to be delivered and received by her. \n\nYou need to get basic with her. Cellular level basic. She needs to earn money. That\u2019s it. No more Uni talk.

If it\u2019s deferred it will still cost something at some point. How will you guys swing those payments.\nHow much will she earn with this additional degree? Does she plan to go back to work after it. \nWhy are mothers more important than fathers?", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like she wants to be a professional student, whereas you want a partner to contribute to the household.  Theoretically, there is nothing wrong with either, IF your budget allows it.  That doesn't seem to be the case.", "To me the question is what is the return on investment for another degree compared to what she has now?\nAnd will that investment actually be used?\n\nFrom what I read she does not want to swap roles and work, so looks like that investment will never yield returns. \n\nNTA.", "My partner and I both work full time and have our toddler who goes to daycare. We try to do everything 50/50. I was actually thinking of doing a course to help gain another type of employment which I will do online in my free time - separate from my responsibilities. We are a team and equal. My god I would never dream of doing something that would mean my family suffers. \n\n I\u2019d be super pissed as she doesn\u2019t seem to care or willing to help your families financial situation. You could come up with a compromise like her working two years to help with savings and then study. A big NTA for sure.", "NTA. All your concerns are completely justified - your wife is going to drive you into bankruptcy earning degrees. At this point, she needs to understand that she has children and that they should be her first priority. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like she really has no intention of ever working - she just wants to be an eternal student. And she is now making decisions that effect the entire family (and causing you to be overdrawn) without consulting anyone first. *This* is the biggest problem.", "NTA, your wife is suffering from fear of failure.  Suggest some counseling sessions, individual and couple.  You are going to have to be firm and tell her you can\u2019t do this for much longer.

New job means she will be a newbie that will require to learn additional skills/application of her theoretical knowledge that universities not alleays provide, ask others for help. Also, it means she will have to earn/climb up the social position/status with new coworkers, i.e. start from the beginning, which she currently does not need to do if she goes back to university.
