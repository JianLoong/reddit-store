New job means she will be a newbie that will require to learn additional skills/application of her theoretical knowledge that universities not alleays provide, ask others for help. Also, it means she will have to earn/climb up the social position/status with new coworkers, i.e. start from the beginning, which she currently does not need to do if she goes back to university.
