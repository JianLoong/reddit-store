I tried to be nice to her new boyfriend the whole time I was there, why did she have to embarrass and talk bad about my friend?\n\nI went to my room crying and didn't leave for the whole lunch.

You acted right. Don't let them tell you otherwise.", "NTA\n\nAdults should know better than talk shit about a teenager.  Legit I think you are the adult in this situation than your mom and aunt. Because a normal teenager would scream at them but you chose to go inside. You did a good thing by showing the true face of the aunt to her boyfriend.", "NTA. No boyfriend cares about a niece lol. Your aunt seems like she is all the things she is saying about your friend.", "NTA\n\nSo let me get this straight: your adult aunt was backbiting a young person as a means of entertainment at your expense while folks could have been getting to know her new partner. Was that supposed to show her good character, to eviscerate a child and a friend of her niece?\n\nYou were understandably hurt and arose to defend your friend with courage to speak up when everyone else was laughing, seeming to agree with your aunt. That is not being an AH. That is being brave.\n\nYou are emotionally considerate and someone who will hopefully have many years to refine your empathy so that you can deliver information more effectively. That makes you, sensitive, growing and a good friend not an AH.\n\nThe only advice I have for you is to work on delivery, but you're only 16 and I don't mean that as an insult. I mean that to say you're still young and with your feelings hurt and emotionally attacked it's fair that you may not have chosen the best argument to counter your aunt's rudeness. But I know you will develop those skills because you have a good caring heart.\n\nOur society is the one that's the problem that make people think tearing someone apart is entertainment and using that as an attack. If the aunt's boyfriend finds this attractive he shows the kind of person he is and if the scenario is off putting to him, and he were to leave, is would be because he probably doesn't want to be with a woman who would turn around the next day and stab him in the back in a conversation just to get the laughs of friends, family or strangers.  \n\nMost of all if he sees a better side of her he'll be forgiving and if he's really a true human he might help her gain the confidence to understand that such behavior is unbecoming of a true adult.\n\nAs for your mother and other family members trying to correct you, you will always get the blame because she is seeing through the lens of embarrassment. \"my daughter had an outburst was rude and embarrassed me.\" That's not a fair appraisal. And often the way we respond when we are young  is not the most effective but you should not be blamed for defending someone.  Negative talk is rude and it hurts not just you for hearing it but your friend, by putting in their head her perception of your friend that others may not have had. They may carry those judgments into the future and be precious against her for something they didn't even see or even agree with originally. Backbiting, gossip and general meanness. They're the worst.\n\nKeep it up! be brave. stand up for your friends. It's great practice for standing up for justice in general. And maybe since it was your dad's birthday you can speak with him or with someone else in the family who may have been laughing just to go along to get a better perspective and support from someone who actually knows you. That would help them understand that laughing to go along with a grown adult is not as important as being the adult who says \"hey this is her friend and we shouldn't talk badly about them.\" Your example of courage is a good example for the rest of your family honestly.\n\nIn the meantime I am proud of you, courageous person!\n\nEdited to correct voice typing errors, working with two healing wrists here.", "NTA: your aunt is embarrassed because she\u2019s an awful person and her boyfriend might see It", "NTA.

That would be the reason her new boyfriend may end things with her. \n\n2 the way you describe your behaviour dues make it seem you\u2019re both acting inappropriately. The people laughing may mean that they agree in part about her behaviour but would never mention it.  Perhaps give a thought about that\n\nBy no means does that make what your aunt did right. She is wrong for what she did", "NTA\n\nYour aunt sounds horrid and you probably did the BF a huge favour.\n\nYou did nothing but show loyalty and character by standing up for a goof friend, if anyone has destroyed the relationship its the aunt because her initial words would have been a huge red flag to anyone.\n\nI am wondering why your mom was not more supportive though and maybe you need to ask her that, and what she would do if your Aunt was talking about you like that.", "NTA\n\nShe started talking bad about someone - SHE made herself look bad.\n\nIf BF runs away - it\\`s not because of \"evil niece (tm)\"- but due to crappy personality.  \nMen can be stupid (i know, I am one) but we do have standards - if we see someone treat a minor this way - we know they ain\\`t gonna be good to us either.\n\nSo, you have a toxic family - and you could benefit from r/raisedbynarcissists where you will find similar experiences, understanding, and tips on how to handle these things until you can strike out on your own.", "NTA - if the boyfriend was showing he wasn't impressed by this, it wasn't because he thought *you* were a \"brat\" as your aunt claimed. I'd lay money it's because he just watched his b\\*\\*tchy gf trash a child right to her face (you said your friend, who she was shit-talking, was present) *and* send her niece out of the event in floods of tears.\n\nYour aunt is an AH and desperate to unload her guilt onto you. Why your mum is backing your aunt & not you (from the account you presented) I have absolutely no idea.", "Nta she embarrassed her self", "NTA and who in the world has ever been put off a relationship by someone's niece.", "NTA. Reminds me of the scene in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban when Aunt Marge comes in talking trash about Lily Potter and Harry accidentally inflates her like a balloon.", "Your mom is the biggest asshole in this story. You are NTA", "Yep, boyfriend saw who Auntie was and believed her.", "This. OP, this guy SHOULD dump her when he realizes she bullies children. And that's not on you, it's on her. Also, sorry your mom doesn't stick up for you. I hope she's a better mom in other ways.", "\u2026 also \u201cwho wants to date someone with a brat for a niece\u201d ummmm literally no one cares. When I start dating people the first thing I\u2019m thinking certainly isn\u2019t \u201coh god I sure do hope their extended family is well mannered and quiet.\u201d Like what the actual fuck kind of excuse is that, they clearly just wanted to make OP feel like shit!!", "Right? Who wants to go out with a\nGrown ass women who trash talks a kid? Guy was probably halfway out the door the second she started. What a miserable hag. \n\nNTA- she was rude and just out of the blue trashed your friend just apparently to have something to say.\n\nYou weren\u2019t a brat- she was a- something else that starts with a b that I don\u2019t know if I can put here (the rules seem to shift sometimes lol).\n\nThis women needlessly trash talked an innocent kid just for the hell of it. You\u2019re a good person for standing up for your friend- that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re supposed to do for people you care about, have their back.\n\nI think your aunts a lost cause, she just sounds like a miserable person but I\u2019d maybe try to talk to your mom after she leaves and explain that it really upset you that your aunt would put someone you care about down- especially since it sounds like a lot of the things she was targeting are things you feel you have in common (you said you guys are very similar so I can see how the insults would hurt even more because she\u2019s basically not only insulting your friend but you as well.)\n\nYou seem like a wonderful person and a great friend. Everyone deserves a friend who has their back even when they don\u2019t know it.", "Exactly. I don't care if my partner has a brat for a niece. I do care if they mock a child.", "THIS RIGHT HERE. OP, I wouldn't worry about the aunt and BF's relationship.  If anything, BF might have been thinking who complains about a girl so viciously and in front of guests?  Like aunt couldn't think about anything else to talk about? NTA.", "But OP IS loud and obnoxious and not everyone thinks that it is acceptable behaviour. I personally don't find it amusing. ESH.", "Exactly. That was an amazing twist of logic there! I wouldn't want to be in an argument with aunt or mom. Damn, this makes me sad. OP, continue to be an amazing friend and stand up for the people you love, and do not let the shade your family throws at you get under your skin. We love you.", "Yeah, no one has ever broken up with someone because they had an annoying niece. What a strange thing to put on a kid.", "Thanks ! And I hope your wrists get better", "I wanted to say this but I knew in my heart it had been said. I agree with this judgement.", "Agree. ESH, OP and friend sound really annoying.", "I was 10 in the past, I stopped going to eat lunch at my grandmother's then, that's where", "We have a lot of friends, also I have like a Google translate definition of what those two mean. I get what I want to say but thanks for the input I will try to be a better person and not be so loud \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "Nono, she didn't interact with my aunt the whole party, and I just hugged her", "And fuck your Aunt and Mom for trying to blame his exit on you.  Toxic assholes.", "Exactly", "Yeah if I'm on a date with someone and they start taking shots publicly about a teenager, especially the best friend of their relative, I'm out.", "And if they complain to you when he dumps her ass, tell them what poster above said; that maybe he doesn't date people who bully children.", "That's exactly right. When I was dating, I wouldn't have cared in the slightest if my girlfriend had a brat for a niece\u2014as long as she didn't live with us\u2014but I would have run away at the speed of light from a woman who treated a child (or anyone!) like this.", "At best, mom has has a blind spot with regard to auntie.", "Mum and aunt are perfectly aware that THIS will be the real issue with the BF if there is fallout. They are just trying to guilt OP.\n\nVery few people would break up with someone because they have a so-called bratty niece. Plenty of people would break up with someone who trash talks kids and makes their own niece cry with their toxic behaviour.", "THIS RIGHT HERE. I'm sorry OP that your aunt was so cruel.  You are a good friend to stand up to your best friend as you did. But if BF ends the relationship with your aunt, its because of what SHE did and nothing to do with you. NTA", "They're 16, and that's pretty normal behavior for teens. What you consider \"acceptable\" isn't universal, and not a good enough reason to speak poorly of a minor.  NTA.", "And it's perfectly fine for the aunt's boyfriend to decide the aunt mocking children who she's in a position of authority over (instead of ignoring them)  is unacceptable behavior.\n\n\nIt's not OP making her aunt look bad- aunt did that on her own.", ">\t I had possibly just ruined their relationship cause who wants to go out with someone with a brat for a niece\n\nI get that teenagers can be annoying, but would her having a bratty niece stop you from dating dating a woman you like?", "Maybe OP is an asshole about that, but I do not think it is very relevant to the current situation. You do not shittalk people like that anyway.", "OP is young so that's the ESH here.", "If my date was introducing me to extended family after only 2 weeks (questionable behavior to me) and then had a relative accuse them of always treating them terrible, especially *a child* I'd be noping out first chance I got. Aunt ruined her own relationship by wearing nothing but red flags.", "I'd be baffled how it even comes up. Trashing random people they don't even know isn't a good look.", "The idea that the relationship was put in jeopardy for any other reason is laughable. Nobody wants to date someone with a bratty niece? Really?"]}
