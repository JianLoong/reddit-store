I think parasitic leech was a bit much and unnecessary, so YTA for how exactly you handled it - you could just have said no. \n\nAnd possibly unpopular opinion, but the fact that you volunteered to help her out before, and insisted even though she said you didn\u2019t need to, didn\u2019t obligate her to help you out, especially since it sounds like you hadn\u2019t officially arranged any kind of repayment. It is a little weird to insist on giving someone money they didn\u2019t ask for and then expect to get something in return (especially since it\u2019s not clear how much you gave her vs. how much you wanted from her). She is right that what you chose to do in that situation was on you.\n\nAlso, not sure if English is your first language or if you\u2019re not in the US so have speech patterns I\u2019m not familiar with, but \u201cI thought it would be nice to ask her for help\u201d seems like a really weird way to describe asking someone for a loan. Usually \u201cI thought it would be nice to [do something involving someone else]\u201d means something that person would find nice, not something you would find nice. So while I get asking her for help, if you genuinely thought this was a great opportunity for her, to help you out, that seems kind of weird and suggests a not-great dynamic between you two.\n\nSo you absolutely weren\u2019t obligated to help her out a second time, but it seems like you may have got overly bent out of shape about even being asked. \n\nPlus, taking the high road in situations like this often works better - by launching into to her and calling her names, she can now focus on how you\u2019re an evil bad person and not on whether she was right to ask you for money in the first place. I realize you probably want to her to see the error and injustice of her ways, but insults don\u2019t have that effect \u2013 people will just double down when they feel attacked.

Realistically it sounds like she only had a job for a month or two (since miscarriage is only a thing through weeks 6-20 in pregnancy) so most likely she didn't actually have any extra after paying down other debts she likely had at the time.

She was not owed shit.", "After personal circumstances, I don't give out money that I can't afford to get back \n\nI don't give money out number 1 unless I can afford to not get it back and number 2 unless I explicitly tell someone whether they need to pay me back or not\n\nThey both suck in their own ways, but I think its kind of on op for not explicitly saying \"hey you owe me back at some point\" when the friend was homeless at the time, with no job\n\nEdited for clarify", "Thank you!! \n\nI'm glad you appreciated it!", "She tried guilt tripping him saying  shed have a miscarriage if he didnt help? I think his comment is valid it proves her guilt tripping shit isn't working???", "Agreed but she opened that can of worms by saying she would automatically have a miscarriage if he didn\u2019t help and support her\u2026 not the way it works obviously so that\u2019s why he said that bit was it a bit out of line yes but it sounds like this chick is delulu but should also know better at 37", "Can you explain why cruel? Why should he care? Plenty of women get miscarriages, you can't care about them all? Why should he care about hers?", "I sort of confused myself, and for some reason I thought it was her second pregnancy lol thank you for clarifying.", "Get out of each others lives! You both suck. Stop talking. Also, dont you save? If she had lend you money back then when she did have a job she would have even less money now.", "I think that doesn't really make it less illegal to fire pregnant women but that's probably different everywhere", "Nothing warrants out loud apathy towards innocent children.", "Look, it\u2019s different if he said \u201cI hope you have a miscarriage\u201d or if he threatened/intimidated her in any way. But merely stating \u201cI wouldn\u2019t care if x,y,z happened to you\u201d doesn\u2019t make you an AH (in my opinion.) but that\u2019s just my feelings on the matter. I respect your feelings as well, and I understand a comment like that could severely upset someone. But in this case, the \u201cfriend\u201d dug her own grave.", "TBF, it does sound a *bit* like this without OP's edit. I think OP would have done well to just leave all name-calling and such comments out of this, but still NTA.", "No one really knows what happened, op sounds like a super unreliable narrator, but why don\u2019t you point out to me where I was wrong, so I can go back and edit it? (Instead of just downvoting me) \n\nI\u2019m genuinely curious as to how I misinterpreted op\u2019s words\u201d", "I mean, my homeless friend asked me if i could send him $20 for gas and some food, and said when he gets out of this situation he'll pay me back. \n\nHes not getting out any time soon, but he still had the decency to offer to pay me back.", "He literally said they can discuss that later and for her to just take of herself, did he not?", "Right? Plus expecting two and a half GRAND from a friend when you're struggling is... Wild. WILD.", "Legally speaking, OP was not owed anything. \n\nHowever, in the court of being a decent human being, when a friend helps you out, ya help them when they need it. If ya can't help monetarily, you help in other ways. \n\nYour response makes you sound like a parasitic leech.", "Exactly. That money was a gift. OP knew it. Ex-friend knew it. In fact, asking for a gift back is another AH move. There was no owing here. Now, that didn't mean she shouldn't have considered helping OP when OP needed it. But it sounds like she only worked for a month or so if she is still in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy (since miscarriage can only happen in the first 20 weeks, after that it's called something else). So it's very likely she was still in debt herself at the time. She was just an AH for how she refused.", "He helped his friend when she was in need. When the tables turned, he didn't ask for repayment, he asked for the same consideration. She had every right to say \"no\" but, it's the way she handled it. She could have said that she is just getting back on her feet and doesn't have it to spare right now, which is understandable. Instead, in an AH move, she burned a bridge. She showed him who she was and now he doesn't have to worry about her anymore.", "I commented before op edited saying she brought that possibility into play by stating him refusing her the money would cause a miscarriage. If he'd brought it up totally unprompted, it would have been just saying the most hurtful thing he could think of for no other purpose than to cause emotional distress (cruelty).\n\nWITH the edit that she brought it up, NTA. Tbh I don't think that's how miscarriages actually work anyway tho I'm no expert. But her bringing in the possibility recontextualizes his response to essentially mean \"take your sob story elsewhere, your problems aren't my concern.\" Which is totally valid and I no longer have a problem with it in that context", "If it's not solely because she is pregnant then it is not a issue. Being pregnant does not automatically make it where you can't be fired. It's across the board lay offs and not just her.", "But it isn\u2019t that though, it was to insult and hurt her the most possible. I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t actually wish that upon the baby", "A fetus is not a child & she shouldn't have used the fetus as a bargaining chip. This woman should not have children", "1) He didn\u2019t blame her for the father leaving, not even close. Stating that the father left isn\u2019t somehow putting the onus on her. \n\n2) He didn\u2019t tell her he hopes she has a miscarriage. You are grossly mischaracterizing his words when he was simply responding to her threat of \u201cIf you don\u2019t give me money, i\u2019ll have a miscarriage\u201d. \n\nYou made a lot of weird assumptions about OP when most of them aren\u2019t even true and he hasn\u2019t painted himself as an unreliable narrator so it\u2019s odd for you to jump there and twist his words into something they\u2019re not.", "Some people hate owing debts.  I was really struggling for money last winter, and I ended up asking my friend for 50 bucks until my next paycheck.  \n\nHe sent me $150, and we almost got into a fight about it because he said I didn\u2019t need to worry about paying him back and I insisted that I would.  Eventually we agreed that if I wanted to pay him back however much of it I wanted that\u2019s fine, but he would be considering it a Christmas gift.  And I did end up paying him back all of it, and also got him a gift of my own to show my appreciation for him helping me in a rough time.", "There was a similar situation with a friend of mine who was fleeing from a DV situation. I sent her $20 because she said she had no money for food one night, and I told her it was a gift, but a month later when she was in a better place she just sent me the money back. She didn't even tell me she would do it, she just did it", ">I mean, my homeless friend asked me if i could send him $20 for gas and some food, and said when he gets out of this situation he'll pay me back. \n\nWell you see that is a loan because he promised to pay it back. OP just gave her the money and she accepted.", "I agree here \n\nLegally it's pretty black and white that the friend is in the clear but morally and ethically?\n\nMuch less so \n\nIt sounds like op was pretty explicit that they didn't want money back at the time;  however, if I was ops friend, that op had lent money to, regardless of whether they had wanted to be paid back at the time;  \n\nIf I saw them struggling, as soon as I could afford to I would be offering to start paying them back \n\nLike I said \n\nMuch less black and white from an ethical/moral standpoint then it is a legal one", "I disagree in this case. If her friend was struggling and she offered money and asked that it be paid back later, then sure a friend should pay that back. But that is not what happened.\n\nOP offered money to her struggling friend, friend refuses the offer, OP insists and tells her not to worry about it/pay back however she can.\n\nThat is giving someone money. Expecting repayment under those circumstances is living in delusion", "I mean I think it goes without saying that when you are friends with someone you try to help them out.\n\nWhether or not it was just a gift, to expect the friend to do the same had OP gotten into a bad situation, just like he did, is not too much to ask.\n\nNo idea how asking for money when you\u2019re financially unstable is an AH move. Especially from someone you\u2019ve given money to in the past.", "It\u2019s false to consider what OP did as \u201casking for a gift back.\u201d From the story, what OP did was ask for help from someone they had helped in the past, and who was in a position to help them.", "A miscarriage can happen at any time during pregnancy. People miscarry at 24 or 28 weeks often.", "True, altgough it's quite a hassle to lay off a pregnant woman or one that just had a baby or a failed pregnancy because, at least where I'm from, it needs extra approval by a public authority so I believe most would want to avoid laying her off unless the trouble is really worth it", "1. Now here is where your comprehension is lacking. I didn\u2019t say he blamed her for the father leaving, I said he blamed her for getting pregnant. \nSaying \u201cshe got pregnant\u201d is placing blame on her, forgetting that it also takes a dick and sperm to \u201cget someone pregnant\u201d it\u2019s not twisting words. \n\n2. You\u2019re right, I did misinterpret that, I didn\u2019t see the part where she made the threat first\u2026and to clear the air, I do think ESH.", "This is why I tell people just to pay it forward and remember me when they do so.", "But in this case, a friend gave you money, told you it was not a loan, just something to help you. Then later, when your situation is monetarily much better, your friend who gave you money before is now in financial difficulties and asks you for help - not payback, help. You tell your friend who helped you when you needed it that you won't help him even though you could. AH move.", "His struggling friend...OP is a Man.", "XD, no", "Oh I know several who have been. If it's company wide and she's new  they can prove she wasn't targeted", "1. As if that\u2019s any better? He didn\u2019t blame her for anything. Is your comprehension really that bad or are you just that desperate to make OP the bad guy for things he never said?\n2. I absolutely can blame you because what he said was an understandable response given what she said. It means what it says, she was trying to manipulate him and he didn\u2019t let her and said he didn\u2019t care about her threats.\n\nThe lengths you are going to paint OP as something he\u2019s not is very odd, and your lack of reading comprehension (purposeful or not) is truly hilarious .\n\nAlso editing your comments retroactively doesn\u2019t make you look any better. OP is a non native english speaker, you are absolutely twisting his words.", "Edit: oh yea but to be clear, definitely a dick move to cold shoulder your friend who helped you out. \n\n\nQuote from OP \u201cI want to make it clear that I was not expecting anything in return at that time. We had not discussed repayment\u201d\n\nThat is called a gift. In what world is that not a gift?", "Ah, ty."]}
