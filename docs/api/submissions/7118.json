My husband died of a stroke 2 years ago and he left everything to me. I\u2019m rewriting my will as well in case something happens to me. Originally everything was split 50/50 between the girls but now I\u2019m splitting about 80/20 in favor of Emma. \n\nEmma has ADHD and isn\u2019t doing great in life. In those days everyone just assumed she was lazy and she didn\u2019t get the help children today get until she was in her teens. She just managed to finished high school and is working at a retail store as a stocker. It\u2019s backbreaking and she doesn\u2019t have much in the way of savings or anything. Her car was her father\u2019s when he passed.\n\nSam is works in tech as a project manager and her husband is a doctor. They live in a million dollar house and has 2 kids. I\u2019m not worried about Sam she\u2019s always been very capable and excelled at everything. She was always the overachiever and I don\u2019t think she needs help financially. Her and her husband probably take home $500k after taxes a year.\n\nI want Emma to inherit the house and car when I pass. I think it will be good for her because she can live in it or sell it and buy another one. Sam will be fine and her and her husband have several houses and a summer home. But Sam is angry with me because I\u2019ve made it clear that Emma gets most of our belongings. The bank savings and stocks will go to Sam but if I live to 80s she won\u2019t have too much probably 20-30% of what the house is worth. But I think it\u2019s fair because she is doing much better.\n\nSam called me to yell at me saying I\u2019m favoring Emma. I reminded her of how much worse off Emma is than her but she said since they were both my daughters she should get things 50/50 or it\u2019s favouritism. She reminded me that growing up we always spent more on Emma than her. But that\u2019s because she was at the top of her class while Emma was failing. I put Emma in extra tutoring and the like because she needed it more. She said I should will half of the inheritance to her children for college funds but I reminded her she makes more and can save for them. I told her it\u2019s not about me favoring Emma over her but Emma is worse off and she will be fine which resulted in her hanging up and refusing to come over for Christmas.", "created_utc": 1673498924, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109qmli/aita_for_giving_one_daughter_more_inheritance/", "score": 5424, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, will one daughter be an executor? Have power of attorney? Be involved in future elder care? If so, does your split of assets align with which daughter you'd want in those roles?", "YTA. You need to meet with an elder law attorney in your state who does special needs planning. Leaving almost everything to your ADHD daughter who may not be able to do backbreaking work until she retires could disqualify her from government benefits like Medicaid if she might ever need them. There may be a way to leave them both equal shares but in a way that keeps your daughter with ADHD eligible for benefits.\n\nAlso, your successful daughter may fall on hard times. Her husband could leave her, she could have an accident that disables her. Does she not deserve the same financial cushion that your other daughter does? Know that if you leave her anything but 50% of your estate it will complicate her grief when you die and lead to unresolvable trauma. I know, I\u2019m living it now and it\u2019s very painful. Do you want to knowingly inflict that pain on her?", "Yta \nSam just wants for once to be equal\nYeah it\u2019s your money but this is going to fail miserably in all relationships", "YTA. There's a story similar to this one that's about a year old, in which the mother willed everything to the son with ADHD and left her daughter with nothing, but also wanted the daughter to be the executor of the will. She was flabbergasted when her daughter got upset. \n\nThis isn't about the money or assets. It's about the rampant favoritism on your part. The fact that you rewrote the will after their father could no longer have a say is a clear indicator that you've been playing favorites with Emma her whole life, and you want it to continue even after you're gone. I hope you don't get too attached to Sam's kids, because I have a strong feeling you won't be seeing them very much after this.", "YTA not for the inheritance but clearly you have always put the other sister on the back burner.  Your other daughter doesn't need money what she probably wants is equal love and attention.\n\nEdit to add in seeing responses from OP\nNope you're straight up the AH.  You paid to give her the best tutors.  You're paying half her rent currently and her therapist You absolutely do favor her and she got the dad's car currently.  Name five things you've done for the other one.\n\nThink possibly you've enabled her to live off of you?", "Info: What if anything would your husband have had to say about this situation?", "Info: is favoring Emma in the will worth losing your relationship with Sam?  That is where you\u2019re headed. It seems like Emma has been favored their entire lives and this is the straw that broke the camels back.", "You know this likely isn't about the money, right?\n\nSam understandably feels like you care more about Emma than her. For whatever reasons, good or bad, Emma has received more help, more attention, and more consideration from you and your husband for their whole lives. Many will extrapolate that to amount of love/care. Sam likely feels that you love Emma more and that no matter what she does, you're always going to favor her sister. Maybe it's irrational, maybe it's not. But those are normal human feelings, and they're valid.\n\nYour intentions are well-meaning, and a rational, unbiased person would understand why you're wanting to provide more financially for Emma, but you do need to recognize what message you're actually sending to Sam if you go this route. You can explain your reasons to Sam all you want, but it's irrelevant to someone who already feels like they're second. Sam is going to feel hurt and resentful because yet again, it's a sign that Mom loves and favors Emma more. You should also be aware that once you're gone, Sam won't want much to do with Emma. This is the kind of thing that drives wedges through families for decades. \n\nNo judgement", "YTA. So you mean to tell me Emma has *always* gotten more by your own admission, your husband caused Sam to have an eating disorder, and despite (or in spite) being pushed aside for your favorite Emma, Sam has come out financially and emotionally stable while the child you favored is still failing? \n\nAlso someone else pointed out, I certainly hope you\u2019re making Emma the one to be power of attorney. She gets everything so she should be in charge of your care. Don\u2019t take away from Sam and then expect her to do anything for you when it sounds like you haven\u2019t done anything for her. \n\nMoney changes. Sam could lose everything, Emma could get her shit together. Who knows. What Sam currently knows is that she will never be treated as well as her sister, not even in your death.", "I really want to know what happens", "It\u2019s your choice but it\u2019s not fair and will create animosity. Different life choices created different circumstances. So Sam is supposed to be punished because of her life choices? Does Emma have a learning disability too because I know plenty of highly successful people with ADHD. I think you need to split 50/50.", "YTA - it is favouritism whether you think it is or not. Based on Sam\u2019s reaction, this is something that has been a pattern for her entire life, and it\u2019s clear that she holds some resentment that you favoured her sister so much in childhood. Yes Emma needed extra help, but did that extra help result in you neglecting Sam?", "Slight YTA.  I'm on the side that it should be fair regardless their personal achievements.\n\nBoth can inherit the house with the stipulation that Emma be allowed to continue to live there but if the house is sold it is split between the two.  In our situation, the attorney drew up a cotenancy agreement.  You should check into it.", "NAH\n\nI don't think you're an asshole for choosing equity here, one child clearly needs more help. That said, I don't think your daughter is an asshole either. There is clearly a lot of built up resentment and I can see why. You did your best, the same way my parents did, but when you spend your whole life watching your sibling get more attention, time, and care than you, because they need more help, resentment builds. My brother was the problem child who needed extra care and I was the child who could be independent. Partially because my parents spent so much time on my brother that I had to be. That doesn't mean I didn't want help from them or just their time. To your daughter, this is just another moment of you choosing her sister. She can't see past the pain to realize that this is actually fair.", "Why not help Emma now? Why wait until you die?\n\nShe's only 32, her quality of life can atoll be improved  with the right professional assistants, help, ...\n\n\nAfter that you can just split 50/50. So Sam still wants to help Emma after you are gone.\n\nIt's  not nice of Sam either, she shouldn't yell at you.\n\nESH except Emma.", "YTA\n\n>Emma has ADHD and isn\u2019t doing great in life. In those days everyone just assumed she was lazy and she didn\u2019t get the help children today get **until she was in her teens.** \n\nEmma got \"extra help and the like\" growing up and Emma got \"the help children get today\" starting in her teens. Sam did not get either of those things, because she did was doing well in school. And it sounds like Emma probably got more of your attention and emotional resources too, because Sam was \"easy.\"\n\n Emma is now 32. Not 18. Not 25. 32. \n\n>is working at a retail store as a stocker. It\u2019s backbreaking and **she doesn\u2019t have much in the way of savings or anything.** **Her car was her father\u2019s** when he passed.\n\nEmma already received your husband's car. What did Sam get when he died? Do you have full access to and knowledge of Emma's finances? Maybe she spends carelessly or chooses not to work hard. Perhaps because she knows that you will always bail her out.\n\nMeanwhile\n\n>She was always the overachiever and **I don\u2019t think** she needs help financially. Her and her husband **probably** take home $500k after taxes a year.\n\nSo you generally have no clue about Sam? Sam has two kids and is 29 years old. Maybe Sam's kids will need help paying for college. \n\nAny way you slice it, you are absolutely favoring Emma. It's delusional to suggest otherwise.  If your true goal is to \"help\" Emma out, because you think she might be destitute once you're gone, and if Emma is as terrible with money (and adulting) as your post suggests, put everything into a trust with Sam and Emma as equal beneficiaries and let both daughters receive passive income and Sam have control over distributing the principal, since you have no way of knowing that Emma won't spend everything at once. Or acknowledge that you favor Emma.", "YWBTA\nI\u2019d advise you to figure out a way to help Emma financially now, and split the inheritance 50/50. She has a neurocognitive learning disorder that will never go away, but hospitals and courtrooms and businesses everywhere are literally filled with successful professionals with ADHD. Give me a break- I\u2019m 54 with ADHD that was diagnosed a year ago and everyone told me I was lazy, too. I have an advanced degree and a great career and my valedictorian sibling was, and remains, the favorite. I\u2019m much better off financially than my sibling. \nCircumstances can and do change- Sam could get divorced or her husband could be an alcoholic gambler in 15 years, someone could get sick or in a terrible accident or sued- who knows. They are both your children, and I\u2019d bet Sam is having a gut reaction not because of entitlement but because it\u2019s reinforcing the painful message she got growing up - loud and clear- that she was on her own. That sucks. That would be the legacy you\u2019d leave more than any money.", "Side note - how capable is Emma of using the money responsibly if she has a lot of difficulty in everyday life? Just giving her everything may not be the favor you think it is. Maybe a trust or something with more oversight would be a better fit for her?", "YTA. There are no guarantees in life. Something could happen and both daughters could end up needing help. Sounds like Emma always got more. ADHD is not an excuse to be less. My son is the same age as Emma and was diagnosed with ADHD at age 6. He\u2019s bought a house, married with 2 children and thriving. Maybe you should concentrate on working with Emma to help her get the tools she needs to thrive - additional schooling, etc. Sam should not be made to feel less than because she doesn\u2019t have ADHD.", "YTA. It\u2019s not *actually* about money. It\u2019s that the division of assets is a stark reminder that Sam was treated differently and she feels that you have never treated HER fairly. My sibling has extreme dyslexia and also Asperger\u2019s. They cannot hold a job and are legally disabled. They get the house when my parents pass.\n\nIn exchange, my other sibling and I are getting a third of the value of the home in cash. I am arguably more well-off than either of my siblings (and, by the way, I was just diagnosed with ADHD later than Emma). \n\nHoweverrrr.. I could care less if they willed everything to my quote unquote worse off sibling. Because I know and feel that my parents have always loved us equally. Since Sam is so angry, you need to do some introspection to figure out why if you stand a chance of repairing your relationship. If at all possible.", "This isn't about finances. It's about a sibling being favoured over the other her W H O L E L I F E. The penalty of being better in life is an excuse for the mother to use.", "YTA. You are already guaranteeing that as soon as your die your family will break up and girls will be er talk again.", "I don't know, I flip between YTA and NTA. On one hand it's your choice, on the other, your husband's will had other directions. \n\nI'm going to share a few comments also... \n1) You're setting them up for hurt and fighting when you die (if not sooner). Although apparently family fighting around wills is common, so maybe there is nothing to be done. \n2) Why not focus in equity, what does Emma need for future security and stability. Example, maybe Emma gets the physical house, but some of the items are split. \n3) Sam mentions belongings, maybe there are some items you own that are important to her. Why not find out what those are?", "ESH: The intent isn't wrong, but your plan of action is. You could place most of this in a trust for Emma since she's so behind, but you shouldn't show such obvious favoritism. I get leaving her the house and the car, that makes sense... but other finances should be more evenly split.", "I always think these are the kind of decisions that tear families apart. It often translates as favouritism, no matter your rationale or intentions. Also, no-one can predict the future. Emma could win Lotto tomorrow, and equally Sam could have a life mishap that results in financial distress. So don't base it on current situations, base it on they are both your daughters, loved equally, and should share the inheritence.  Split it 50/50 otherwise YTA", "YTA. \n\nNot necessarily about the split itself, but everything about how you talked to Sam. Clearly there is some long standing feelings of being overlooked, and the way you shut her down was incredibly insensitive.", "YTA, only because going from 50/50 to 80/20 is a drastic change in the inheritance.  Especially, if the 80/20 is basically money and then she gets the house and car on top of that.  That would ruffle a lot of feathers.  You can't fault Sam and punish her because she has a great life.  Anymore than you can award Emma because of the guilt you feel about her health.\n\nI think your guilt is the culprit here.  You should look inside yourself.  Maybe discuss it with a therapist.  When you do a will, you shouldn't tell anyone what's in it.  There will be a day they find out.  Hopefully, if you decide to change things, you will know enough to keep things to yourself.", "Ooooft this is a tough one. My sibling is the same - my parents have always worried about him but in turn he hasn\u2019t learned to cope on his own. I\u2019d be livid if my parents left him the same split as you\u2019re intending to do.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with 50/50? Surely there will still be enough for Emma to buy a home with 50% of your estate. Even 60/40 in Emma\u2019s favour would be more decent. 80/20 is a jump.\n\nYTA", "I\u2019m actually in this situation with my mum. My sister is struggling and a single parent. My mum asked me how I felt if she gave more to my sister on the will by revising the original will which was 50/50. I actually supported her decision and suggested that it could be split between the nieces and nephews or do a trust. My sister has ADHD, PTSD and chronic depression. I know my parents love me and I love my sister and her kids. My husband and I do not need it. That\u2019s the thing I think your daughter who is well off is missing the point that you\u2019re making. You want to give to your daughter who is struggling the house and car because she would need it, meanwhile the one really could sell one of her other homes and put that as a college fund for her kids. It\u2019s not about favoritism. NTA", "I think there is another issue here. What did the father want?\n\nWas this discussed with him before he died? Because if his will said, 'everything to my wife unless she predeceases me and in that case 50/50 to my children'...then surely his wishes should be taken into account too?", "NTA but I\u2019m against 80/20 split. I highly suggest putting anything for Emma in a trust. My experience working with ADHD individuals is that they can be incredibly impulsive and don\u2019t think things through. I fear Emma may blow through any inheritance or sell the house and squander that cash. I would NOT make Sam the executor of your estate or have her manage the trust. Furthermore, I would completely bypass Sam and bequeath directly to your grandchildren.", "I understand and empathize with both sides but I gotta ask; why did you feel the need to put this information out now? \n\nWhy take the chance of ruining your relationship with Sam and by extension your grand children? It\u2019s almost as if you wanted to fight about money. Timing and consideration are important. \n\nSam\u2019s pissed because you favored Emma her whole life and you intend to continue this trend even after you cross the rainbow bridge. \n\nEmma doesn\u2019t have the same opportunities as Sam and will need help after you\u2019re gone. I get that but that\u2019s not what Sam is hearing. Sam\u2019s resentment is rooted in childhood disappointments. \n\nShe does sound greedy but I think she\u2019s reacting more from a lifetime of being overlooked, pushed aside, or sacrificed. That I get. \n\nYou made a mess and complicated that mess by broadcasting your intention to continue the unequal treatment. \n\nYou may want to structure Emma\u2019s inheritance so that she doesn\u2019t get everything at once. Sounds like she could burn through it if there\u2019s no limits. Sam would have been the person to help out here but you\u2019ve fucked that up. \n\nParents who favor one child over another suck. You are an asshole for treating your children differently and continuing to disappoint the one you ignored.", "YTA for now, sam is living comfortably. But a lot can change before you die. You're assuming that Emma will never get her life together and will never marry or have kids or be financially stable. You have no way to know that when you die she will need these things more than Sam does. \nYour best bet is to do 50/50. Because they are equals. Neither more deserving or less deserving because they're both your children.", "YTA for how it sounds like you went about it. Favoritism hurts. Unless your kid has a debilitating disability or chronic illness, which ADHD is often not, it's best not to leave one kid more than another. Setting up a trust fund with specific conditions could be a lot better.  People are also often over extended when they buy homes because they aren't smart with money.  Idk sounds like this is a lifelong problem where you've always been kind of harder on Sam.", "YTA. I feel as though your punishing Sam for being successful and you should split it 50/50.", "I'm going with YTA but I might be biased. My mum is leaving everything to my brother because he makes terrible decisions and she thinks he needs extra help.\n\n He bought a house he can't afford, traded his brand new car in for a hunk of junk because he wanted to go off roading and his fiance doesn't want to work and prefers to watch TV all day while they struggle financially. He's always been bailed out of trouble and babied. Does he deserve an inheritance more than me? \n\nI actually told my mum I'm fine with her leaving everything to him but don't ask me for help so she had no one to look after her when she had surgery cos he didn't want to.", "Just going to add that my parents willed more to my brother because he was struggling with grades, keeping a job and had ADHD and behavioral issues and I was an overachiever with a good job a stable relationship. Now, a couple of years after my parents died, I'm the one with serious medical conditions (Narcolepsy AND Epilepsy), an ex-husband who took most of our money, a son with special needs, and I'm struggling to stay employed. I understand giving one kid more money than the other but it's how you went about it. Plus, you can't see the future. Setting up a trust to provide for both daughters in the case of unemployment, medical issues, or other foreseeable problems is super doable.", "I'm leaning NAH. I'll explain:\n\nYou sound like you have valid, well-thought-out reasons for the split you've decided on, but I can honestly see why Sam might be upset.\n\nI really think it sounds like there are deeper and more longstanding issues that need to be addressed here. It sounds like Sam may have some deeper unresolved issues due to a difference in attention and resources (real or perceived) growing up or from feeling like her reward for digging a better ditch is being given a better shovel while watching her (from her perspective) ne'er do well sister be handed everything on a plate. That may or may not reflect the objective reality of the situation but feelings are feelings. \n\nIt's your money and you can do what you want, but you should probably consider that there may be emotional dynamics at play that go well beyond the money, or maybe even have nothing to do with it. Sam may just want to feel like she's equal in your eyes and may have some unresolved issues as to the treatment of her vs. her sister. Being at the top of her class may well have not been as easy for her as you thought.\n\nI really think it sounds like there are deeper and more longstanding issues that need to be addressed here. Then, you might be able to approach the subject of the inheritance without unrelated and unresolved hurt feelings getting in the way.", "YTA. The truth is, you don\u2019t know what the future holds. Sam could get in an accident and become disabled, get divorced, have a stroke, any number of scenarios\u2026you have *no idea* what her future needs are. And yet, you just expect her life to always be good because *you* have decided she has it easy. Do you know how hard that girl worked to get where she is? And it sounds like she got precious little help from you to do it, by your own admission. \n\nThis is what your girl hears from you: no matter how perfect you are, you\u2019re never good enough; sister will always get more from me because reasons. You will lose Sam if you don\u2019t stop this nonsense. \n\n*Parents should never play favorites, no matter the circumstances.*\n\nP.S. A will is your final comment to your children from the grave. Is this really the last word you want Sam to hear from you?", "I was going to say YNTA for doing what you think is equitable but then I was like what went on when you were raising your daughters that Sam got an eating disorder from her father and resents her sister enough that she wouldn\u2019t share an inheritance when she is clearly not in dire straits and then I was like yeah, maybe we\u2019re not getting all the info here. \n\nLike\u2026 I would be so disappointed in myself if I raised my daughter to be as selfish as Sam that I would never blame her alone for being upset. I would be like, where did I fail as a parent. \n\nOn the other hand, if Sam was under the impression she would be getting a specific inheritance from her father her and her husband may not have been saving for specific items under the impression they would be filled by that inheritance\u2014 ie college funds and the like. \n\nYour intent is fine but because there\u2019s obviously missing backstory and I don\u2019t like the response about your husband and Sam, I\u2019m going to say YTA unless you want to clarify other aspects of this.", "I have had severe ADHD my whole life, only recently medicated. Got all A\u2019s whilst being raised part-time in a cult beforehand. YTA. Also, all the comments saying otherwise are valid, but Emma is 32. Common guys.", "Anytime inheritance is split any way other than equally between children it\u2019s a dick move. It sets siblings up to resent each other and no matter the intent shows favoritism. If you really want to help the one help her while you are alive and not once you are dead.\n\nSomething else to think about, giving someone who may be bad with money more money doesn\u2019t always go the way intended and may actually cause more issues for that person.", "YTA\n\nIf the house is sold and split, surely ADHD daughter can buy something suitable with that money. She doesn\u2019t need \u201c80%\u201d, she just needs enough to be comfortable.\n\nYes, I agree daughter making a killing should be more flexible on who gets what. But that doesn\u2019t mean taking away such a significant portion of the inheritance.\n\nIf my parents pulled this BS I\u2019d be pissed.", "YTA- you mentioned in a comment that your husband split if 50/50 because he gave Sam an earring disorder. It seems like Sam has never really gotten support from either of her parent\u2019s so don\u2019t be surprised when she cuts all contact with you.", "As someone who is a scapegoat child, ESH.\n\nThe child not used to having money also won't have a clue how to manage a windfall, so all that cash, assets and the house will soon be reduced to nothing when you're gone anyway, unless the other, more capable child has an incentive not to let everything you ever had completely crash and burn.\n\nYou're punishing one daughter for her achievements.\n\nA compromise would be to split everything but the house equally, write it in the will so the underachieving golden child still has somewhere to live, but also give the capable daughter a small stake in the property so if anything happens, she can ensure the house is kept in a liveable state.", "YTA 100% I will never understand why parents think because one kid is doing well they should be punished for it. What if your other daughter has some life altering situation happen where she ends up worse off? Writing a will off the current situation is incredibly short-sighted. Do you want your daughters to have a relationship when you pass? Because the way your will is set up-they will definitely not.", "YTA- Emma is irresponsible and has no ambition. Ask yourself honestly what she would do with those assets? You have no idea what Sam\u2019s actual situation is and that money might help and it might just be a bonus. You have always favored Emma and it shows", "im gonna say from experience it should be split 50-50.. if not it will be problematic, problem for you now bc sam now wont come over for holidays or maybe she will decide you cant see your grandkids\u2026 later when you are gone she will probably have no contact with emma\u2026\n\nIts best just to do 50-50.. as someone else said , you dont know what may happen years down the road\u2026", "YTA. It feels like you\u2019re punishing Sam for doing well in life. \n\nThere\u2019s not reason it shouldn\u2019t be 50/50.

It\u2019s not about the money. OP is showing favouritism to the same child she\u2019s always shown favouritism to. She describes Sam as an \u201coverachiever.\u201d Kids often go that route to please parents who don\u2019t show them enough affection. \n\nEven if that\u2019s not the case here, why would OP tell Sam about the arrangement? What did she expect would happen? Even if Sam loves her sister, can\u2019t OP understand how hurtful that is? OP could\u2019ve handled this much more delicately but clearly she had some sort of bizarre point to make to her younger daughter. Why?", "YTA. So you admit you raised your daughters unfairly, coddling one over the other and giving her more.

She just finished high school and is working at a retail store as a stocker. It\u2019s backbreaking and she doesn\u2019t have much in the way of savings or anything. Her car was her father\u2019s when he passed.\n\nSam is works in tech as a project manager and her husband is a doctor. They live in a million dollar house and has 2 kids. I\u2019m not worried about Sam she\u2019s always been very capable and excelled at everything. She was always the overachiever and I don\u2019t think she needs help financially. Her and her husband probably take home $500k after taxes a year.\n\nI want Emma to inherit the house and car when I pass. I think it will be good for her because she can live in it or sell it and buy another one. Sam will be find and her and her husband have several houses and a summer home. But Sam is angry with me because I\u2019ve made it clear that Emma gets most of our belongings. The bank savings and stocks will go to Sam but if I live to 80s she won\u2019t have too much probably 20-30% of what the house is worth. But I think it\u2019s fair because she is doing much better.\n\nSam called me to yell at me saying I\u2019m favoring Emma. I reminded her of how much worse off Emma is than her but she said since they were both her daughter\u2019s she should get things 50/50 or it\u2019s favouritism. She said I should will half of the inheritance to her children for college funds but I reminded her she makes more and can save for them. I told her it\u2019s not about me favoring Emma over her but Emma is worse off and she will be fine which resulted in her hanging up and refusing to come over for Christmas.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She never told my sister about the change in the will or used it as a way to manipulate things. Anyway, my sis and the scumbag broke up on their own for their own reasons and some time later my parents amended their will.

Sure, it\u2019s your money, but you are favoring Emma over Sam. Sam doesn\u2019t deserve to be punished for their success. Emma doesn\u2019t deserve to be favored for failing. Your kids will resent each other forever and it\u2019s just not fair. Yes yes, life isn\u2019t fair, but if you can make one portion more fair, why not??", "YTA\n\nafter reading all your comments, etc - yep, you're the asshole.  You absolutely favour Emma, and how is giving her non-liquid assets going to help her at all?  How will she pay the taxes, upkeep, etc?\n\nHonestly, sell the house and car, split it 60/40, and have it in trust for Emma if you absolutely must do something like that.   Don't be surprised when Sam stops talking to you, either.", "I think everyone needs to look at OP\u2019a comments. Sam had an eating disorder as a teen apparently, her father didn\u2019t like her (which OP frames as not getting along and contributing to the ED), and from the way she talks about Sam as a person makes it clear OP doesn\u2019t like Sam either. My guess is Sam was an oopsie and they made sure she knew it without them ever saying the words out loud to her. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about the money to Sam. It\u2019s about Sam still trying to convince herself that her parents did love her even though their actions have made it extremely questionable. It\u2019s about how she excelled and overcame an ED (probably on her own from the way OP avoids answering the question of if she paid for Sam\u2019s treatment or not) all on her own while her parents enabled and doted on Emma. This reeks of clear favoritism. \n\nNow! Before people come for me, Emma is honestly just as much a victim of her parents \u201cparenting\u201d. They didn\u2019t prepare her for adulthood and instead of getting her ACTUAL help like inpatient care, OP just enables the bad parts of Emma\u2019s mental health. No, I\u2019m not saying OP needs to leave Emma to be homeless. But if she\u2019s barely functioning, that\u2019s a serious issue. OP seems to think giving her a house she owns outright will help. But homes fully paid off can still be taken if taxes go unpaid for years. I bet my bottom dollar that OP reminds Emma to pay her half of the rent otherwise Emma would forget (ADHD brain fog affects memory significantly). \n\nOP, YTA. Not just for the obvious favoritism but also for the huge disservice you\u2019ve done to Emma in getting her fully prepared for adulthood. Get Emma enrolled in some inpatient or intensive outpatient care programs, call a family estate lawyer and set up a dispenser trust for both, and split it between them based on the lawyers recommendation. The anger from Sam isn\u2019t about the finances.", "This is a tough one. I understand both the mother's perspective and the daughter's. Personally if it was me and I was doing well, I'd let my other sibling get the majority of the inheritance, but I can see why the younger daughter is upset. If OP did anything wrong, it's that she didn't discuss it with the more successful sibling first.", "Yes yta and you are definitely showing her you favour Emma!", "YTA. You\u2019re punishing Sam for being successful. What happens if her life takes a drastic turn? Universe forbid, but severe illness, disability, divorce, being widowed would drastically alter her life and ability to support herself and her children. I was in my mid thirties and a health care professional when I was injured at work and became disabled. \n\nYou are favouring one child, and from your comments, it\u2019s a lifetime commitment.", "NTA. Mom can do with HER estate as she pleases.", "NAH.\n\nDo whatever you want.  However, unless you're planning to die in the next 25 years, neither of them will benefit from it in any meaningful way.  Emma, whatever issues she might have, is still going to have to figure out how to live her life without the extra money.", "I would have said YTA until I witnessed a situation where a smallish inheritance was split between siblings, one a millionaire and the other in a moderate amount of debt. The millionaire got the other sibling to sign over a1/5th of their inheritance to cover the costs of running the property richer sibling had bought for their parent, so rich sibling wouldn't be out of pocket while they tried to sell it. The inheritance is basically fun money for the rich sibling, although some being put in trust for kids. The poor sibling won't have much after clearing debts (including 10k owed to rich sibling) and settling divorce. \nSo I get that it's sometimes not as simple as splitting things down the middle, but how you handle it makes the difference between yta/nta.\nYou need to discuss it with them, and make sure that they are treated equally when it comes to sentimental items.\nIt's a minefield! But think you need to consider the impact on their relationship when you are gone.", "NTA But why not help emma now instead of making her dependent on your largesse? Have her move in, give her a stipend, and pay for school. 32 isn't too old and ADHD isn't an excuse today nor was it when she was a kid, I'm 10yrs older and there were plenty of resources/meds/therapy when I was in middle school for me and other classmates that were diagnosed with ADD.", "I'm leaning towards YTA\n\nRegardless of your reasoning, you think one of your children deserves more than the other. That is favoritism and will nurture resent between your daughters.\n\n>She reminded me that growing up we always spent more on Emma than her.

I'm not saying \"well *I* can do it, so what's *your* excuse!?\", I want to convey it's possible to succeed in academics with ADHD.\n\nIf all of that seems like too much work you can go with your strategy.", "If I were you I'd sit down with both kids and explain your reasonings.

I totally get were you are comming from. Emma has not chosen to have ADHD and to struggle. But I absolutely understand Sams feelings as I am in a similar position as her.

I get why they doing it and I am okay with it. But it sometimes stings regardless.", "NTA.

By Sam objecting so vehemently and bringing up their childhood it almost comes off as though she enjoys seeing Emma struggle as an adult. There\u2019s clearly some sort of vendetta she\u2019s holding onto and to not want to help your obviously struggling sibling is straight garbage. \n\nAs someone with severe ADHD the struggle is so real and it\u2019s a lonely existence because as much as people might understand they never really \u201cget it\u201d. \n\nSam needs to get over herself.", "YTA.\n\nMy parents each have their own favoured child and not-favoured child and it has damaged our entire family.

I've recently been in a sort of similar situation. My father recently made an inheritance decision that writes me and my brother out of a lot of money. There's a reason for it -- the money will go to someone who has done a lot more to \"earn\" it, and eventually to people who need it more. He talked to me about it first and explained the situation, and I totally get it and support it.

Let me tell you how much equal attention that oldest kid got when her twin siblings were babies. My aunt spent a small fortune on reading tutoring for one child, a large fortune on mental health support for another child, and the others got nothing of the sort.

My dad has a sister who never really got her footing in life. My parents are solid middle class: nothing special, but they\u2019re stable.

And that is to accept that you can't change others, but you can change yourself. I'd hope that if I were making 500k a year that I'd stop resenting others and be happy with all that money. Again, this is a hypothetical but I'm sure willing for someone to give me 500k and let me find out.", "I am sure all three of them have a very different perception of what happened when the daughters were growing up.  Objectively, Emma does have several mental health diagnoses and it sounds like Sam was always healthy and functional. It\u2019s so much easier to point and someone with cancer or some other physical diagnosis and see how the person needed more medical care and accommodations, than it is with mental health. Ultimately though, OP is the one making the will and her understanding of the situation is that Emma\u2019s progress in life has been hindered by mental health challenges. \n\nI do kind of wonder about the sister\u2019s relationship with each other, and whether Sam has always resented Emma and perceived her as getting more attention. That would explain her feelings a bit more. And it may be a NAH situation as many kids with disabled siblings feel resentful and neglected. \n\nI have some chronic health problems due to cancer. I used to work 70-80 hours a week and now I can only work about 20-30.

She\u2019s thriving but feels second place because her sister gets help that she herself doesn\u2019t require? And help in this sense is a monetary thing so part of its at least about money. It could happen, seems weird to me, but not impossible. OP should try asking what her daughter is feeling, if she\u2019ll speak to her.\n\nEdit: if we\u2019re talking about feeling like second place then Emma most certainly feels like she\u2019s second place too. She\u2019ll never be the successful person that her sister. Truly they might resent each other and/or OP when they\u2019re all feeling this notion of second place.

It sounds like she\u2019s homeless without mom while Sam owns multiple properties(good on her). She can and should go to therapy, instead of harboring resentment towards her family.", "That is a fair point. I did miss the comment about the eating disorder but I went back and found it.  It doesn\u2019t sound like OP thought that to be very serious, although she is insightful enough to recognize that her late husband would have wanted the inheritance split 50/50. I wonder if some therapy session with OP and Sam would help the daughter feel less resentful and the mother rethink things a little bit.", "Well for all the reasons Sam\u2019s adult behavior is affected by childhood trauma and such so was was Emma. Maybe Sam watching Emma get all the help did push and encourage her to be super successful. Which good for her. At the same time Emma struggling her whole life and watching Sam be everything she couldn\u2019t be also sucked too. We all are affected by our childhood. And we all obviously are treated differently for the adults we become. Just because Sam watched Emma get tutoring lessons and she didn\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean that Sam\u2019s behavior for wanting 50/50 is right, it just explains why she feels it should be that way. If this is about money. If it\u2019s not about money, if Sam realized she doesn\u2019t need it, then Sam shouldn\u2019t care what happens to the money if OP can change her behavior to reflect of being more supportive of Sam.\n\nI don\u2019t think one line saying Sam feels OP is playing favorites is detailing how Sam really feels. I have no idea what Sam actually said, only what\u2019s posted. If Sam didn\u2019t tell her mom she didn\u2019t care about the money and just wanted a mom that helped and supported her in other ways then that\u2019s completely different. That\u2019s just why I suggested an open and honest discussion. We only know so much on this post. If Sam made it sound like it was just about spending more money on Emma their entire lives then naturally that\u2019s all OP has to reply to as well. Or OP is omitting things. Who knows. If OP knows this is more than just about money for Sam then that needs to be addressed at a deeper level than just doing 50/50 on the will.

I kind of understand 60/40, maybe even 70/30 max.

REAL help would be figuring out what that may be, or figuring out the foundation blocks to a life where she can find her own independence. I\u2019m not assuming she\u2019s lazy. But I do think it\u2019s important that OP doesn\u2019t enable Emma or that Emma relies on her financially too much. Because at some point, Emma won\u2019t have that.

It might bring up resentments about perhaps the way things were focused on Emma's needs growing up.\n\nEdit: Adding YTA because I've seen the comment about the eating disorder.

Probably more difficult now, but not impossible.\n\nAlso, it won't hurt to tell Sam she's proud of what she has achieved.

Lol", "Did you consult an attorney when developing your estate plan? \n\nI would recommend speaking to one about the possibility of a special needs trust for Emma if you haven\u2019t already. Given what you want for both of your daughters, and Emma\u2019s unique situation, it could be an option worth looking into, especially if you want to guarantee she\u2019s provided for in the future. And please, don\u2019t make Sam the administrator of your estate or the trust if you decide to set one up - it\u2019s often best in these situations that those roles be filled by a non-family member.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, you\u2019re **NTA** for handling your assets how you wish. No one is entitled to an inheritance. \n\nAlthough I can sort of appreciate where Sam is coming from. \n\nTo give you a bit of perspective on why she might have reacted the way she did, I am in a very similar situation in my family (although I could only hope to be as fortunate as your daughter is - I\u2019m still paying off my student loans on a public servant salary). I\u2019m the Sam. My older brother and sister are the Emmas in this situation.\n\nMy parents paid a lot of attention to my siblings when we were growing up. My siblings got their time and energy, while I got the benefit (and drawback) of their experience. \n\nMy brother had serious health issues as a child and caused a lot of trouble as a teenager that carried on into adult life and resulted in him having frankly terrible impulse control and bad money management skills, while my sister was academically and socially gifted and they often compared me to her with her as the \u201cgood\u201d example, despite the fact that I never caused trouble and was academically high achieving as well. The main difference between my sister and myself is that I went into a career area that, if I were inclined to go into private practice, *could be* financially lucrative, and that I have no children, while my sister is a frankly amazing (but underpaid) teacher, and has three children to support. Her husband makes a slightly better wage than she does, but with a house to take care of (and all the expenses that come with it), a mortgage to pay, and the kids to look after they don\u2019t exactly have a lot of money to spare.\n\nI understand where my parents are coming from in regards to how they have decided to divide their assets, and they\u2019ve outright expressed to me that they\u2019re less worried about my ability to take care of myself in the long run than they are either of my siblings. I actually think it\u2019s *great* how much thought they\u2019ve put into making sure my sister and her family, and my brother and his are all going to be looked after. But I will admit that for the briefest of moments when they told me about their estate plan, it kind of felt like I was getting the short end of the stick for making certain life choices that put me in a different financial situation than my siblings. I think that\u2019s normal when it involves family, especially when it involves siblings and parents\u2026like, as silly as it is, it\u2019s easy to feel, however briefly, that your parents *must* like your siblings better for whatever the reason might be, or like you\u2019re being *punished* for working hard and doing well in life, or for not *needing* your parents to cover major expenses for you (that poor impulse control I mentioned led to my parents paying my brother\u2019s rent regularly as well as helping him buy quite a few cars over the years.) I got over that very quickly when I looked at things in the big picture and focused on how my parents were trying to do they think is best for each family member in the long run, but it still stung a bit in the moment.\n\nNow that Sam has had some time to cool off, it might not be a bad idea to follow up on this discussion with her. Sam feels *hurt*, so don\u2019t downplay her feelings or imply that she shouldn\u2019t feel the way she does because \u201cshe is doing much better than Emma.\u201d In fact, don\u2019t bring that up at all. She made it clear the root of her hurt isn\u2019t the money. And frankly, given the comment you made regarding her eating disorder and her dad\u2019s contribution towards it, it\u2019s even more blatantly obvious that Sam\u2019s hurt is coming from a place of feeling less important to you than Emma.\n\nSo just hear her out, let her know you\u2019re proud of her, and see what you can do to make sure she feels she\u2019s getting the attention and care she needs from you. She may be 29 and very accomplished, but she\u2019s still your kid and she still wants (and needs) validation *from* and quality time *with* you.\n\nGood luck OP.", ">Fair treatment is not equal treatment.\n\nExactly. Inheritance is about helping the children and that means giving those in need more. \n\nSome of my siblings have got so much more money than me from my parents and two of my siblings are funded by my father. I'm never going to tell my parents they should neglect them because I deserve the same. I would never be angry at my parents for leaving them more because I don't need it that much. \n\nDoes it hurt sometimes? Sure. But I'm also an adult and understand how much my parent's hearts breaks to see their own children struggling, it doesn't matter whose fault it is.", "Little children can understand the concept that different kids have different needs.  \n\nIt\u2019s more like many adults we\u2019re never taught this or have forgotten over time because they\u2019re clouded by their own biases.", "Because her mother is helping Emma and has pretty much ignored Sam for her entire life. Of course, Sam wants some sign that the disparity in her treatment as compares to Emma's throughout her life doesn't extend to the love a mother should have for her children.\n\nWell, she has her answer.\n\nI rather suspect that if OP actually makes out an 80/20 split in the inheritance, Sam will simply disappear from OP and Emma's lives.", "Just my own anecdotal experience here, but a girl born in the 90's would likely not have been diagnosed with ADHD in her pre-teen years. ADD and ADHD just weren't on the radar as they are now, girls were viewed as not being susceptible to behavioral issues like boys were, and the drugs given to kids when they were determined to be \"problematic\" often turned them to zombies, so drugging your kid was widely frowned upon.  Even if the parents here had pushed, I doubt they would have gotten the kind of response we see today- because it just didn't exist then.\n\nTo convert that to medical neglect and lay it at the feet of the parents, in an era when we have fundamentally different views of ADD and ADHD (including the mere fact they are widely recognized, tested for and treated) is unfair.  To imply the parent is now obligated to balance the scales with money now also unfair. \n\nWhat if both girls had mental health/health issues?  Would the obligation be to carefully evaluate which child \"has it worse?\" \n\nI don't think this parent handled the overall situation very well, but I certainly don't see how she *owes* one daughter more simply because that daughter has a condition.", ">Help for managing ADHD needs to start at a young age when the foundations of personality and character are setting it.

Sam will never feel equally loved to her sister and will resent her. She will cut contact with her mother and her sister.

I said they *could* have a *chance* to act together rather than as polar opposites in their mother's love. Everyone goes on about how Sam has $$$ and doesn't need an inheritance and how Emma is soooo poor and handicapped so she needs more $$$. No one mentions that both Emma and Sam probably have excellent qualities that have nothing to do with money or lack thereof. Nor is much mention made of their sibling relationship (I suspect it was strained at best with mom favoring Emma so much) but if these sisters are to have a chance to mend/grow a relationship then the inheritance should be 50/50. Also, with an equal split, then Sam would not feel resentful if asked by mom to check in on Emma occasionally or to make sure no one takes financial advantage of her.

Diagnosis should be helping Emma but it may be hard if she can\u2019t get help now and doesn\u2019t have a support system (childhood diagnosis is better because kids usually have a support system). Also, I know ADHD didn\u2019t get caught in girls enough in the 80s/90s but I\u2019m older than Emma and they caught mine (because my mother wouldn\u2019t let them ignore it and got me assessed) despite my doing pretty well in school (smart but lazy, they thought, ignoring other symptoms), so the way OP writes it off as \u201cJust the times\u201d and absolves herself is frustrating\u2014she should be helping Emma more now or trying, not just thinking of the will, because if the barrier was ADHD, this is a solvable problem.

I don\u2019t have poor organisation - I have *zero* natural organisation skills. I have to build my own systems, and that\u2019s difficult when you lack the executive functioning to do so. My ADHD frequently causes me to forget to eat, because I\u2019m hyperfixating on whatever I\u2019m doing in order to take a break. I started college classes at fourteen. I took a break when I was sixteen to go to our local public high school. Do you know where I got better grades? \n\nCollege. \n\nCollege classes had syllabuses that teachers didn\u2019t deviate much from. College classes had set amounts of homework that I could usually start in advance. High school was me getting handed papers four times a day and being told to complete them and hand them back at different times - and I tried harder in high school than I ever did at college. Unfortunately for OP\u2019s daughter, you usually can\u2019t go to college unless you do halfway decently in high school. \n\nI\u2019m glad that you manage your ADHD well.

Newsflash, different people experience it differently.\n\nI have anxiety, depression, PTSD/CPTSD, OCD, BPD, DID, schizophrenia, autism, and ADHD. \n\nMy ADHD is the *second most disabling* of those diagnoses, right after my anxiety. My executive functioning abilities are near ZERO most of the time and after pushing myself to burn out multiple times I have debilitating panic attacks if I try to push through it on all but the best of days. I can just barely do the bare minimum to take care of myself and keep up paperwork/appointments for disability and other related things, and have had to make use of case management services in the past when I couldn't.\n\nThis is something I've attempted to work on in both therapy and with medication. Haven't found a med that works yet, especially with stimulants being iffy due to a risk of worsening my anxiety, and therapy has helped a lot - as in, I went from well below bare minimum functioning to just able to take care of my basic needs.\n\nMy brother nearly couldn't finish high school, even with my mom helping him as a secondary tutor to his online learning course (which was on an IEP with significant accommodations) because of his ADHD.\n\nOne of my best friends has not been able to hold a job for more than a year or two due to burn out from executive dysfunction, though is working on saving enough to be able to reliably pay for an ADHD med. \n\nOn the other hand, my friend I affectionately call my aunt works a decent job in some kind of software related field with ADHD, has a bit of a messy house, and has a room in her house dedicated to all her hyperfixations. \n\nAnother friend of mine works with a local charter school network in student safety. They struggle a lot with chores and remembering anything important that's not job related (including messaging back lol but I don't care because they've told me they don't give a shit if I spam message them as long as I don't expect an immediate reply. And I've said same to them because I'm the same way.)\n\nIt CAN BE significantly disabling! It's not explicitly labeled as such like autism, but like any type of neurodivergence, it's a *spectrum.*\n\nPeople who don't do well in school because of ADHD are NOT lazy or not applying themselves and it's NOT a personality flaw. In fact, everyone I know that struggled significantly with ADHD and had a hard time in school or in work are some of the hardest working people I know. Definitely much more so than I was in school - I am a \"former gifted kid\" who *coasted* through school to the point I got a full ride to college before crashing and burning. And I'd say I'm still a decently hard worker - just my current project right now is intensive therapy and taking care of myself because I'd like to go back to school for neuropsychology one day.\n\nLike great for you. But don't act as though your experience is universal. And DON'T call other people with ADHD lazy or flawed because they are more disabled than you!\n\nEdit in response to u/ Lower-Capital9730 below since I don't particularly feel like responding directly to someone so obviously strawmanning (specifically, by arguing against the idea that there can't be other factors, something I know very well and the reason for providing diverse examples):\n\nYes, and I also listed several examples of people who ONLY have ADHD (or in a couple of cases, ADHD and anxiety). I also am very well aware of which conditions have an effect on both my ADHD and my general functioning, to what extent, and how.\n\nI know this because the diagnoses that ARE treatable with medication I've managed to tease out the symptoms of - INCLUDING the ADHD, because I have been on a medication that worked but had dangerous side effects before.\n\nMy point was that ADHD CAN be significantly debilitating to the point its symptoms are the single most disabling ones I experience, and is significantly disabling for other less disabled people. My brother has no other diagnoses, and is MORE disabled by it than I am.\n\nI also never claimed it was solely their ADHD. That doesn't mean ADHD wasn't a major or even the primary factor. I'm trusting their accounts that it is, especially where it is their only diagnoses and they don't display symptoms of additional disorders. \n\nThis was in response to someone claiming that ADHD CAN'T be debilitating. I suggest you read my post again.\n\nIn response to u/ Strong-Panic Motivation and executive functioning are not the same thing. I've already said how I know the difference. I'm honestly not even sure I would qualify for the depression diagnosis anymore, but as for the rest: eight years of therapy and having had my ADHD medicated at one point has made it VERY CLEAR which symptoms are almost certainly the ADHD. I can't say 100 percent, but if ADHD med make symptom go bye-bye, ADHD probably the reason!\n\nI hope everyone else will excuse my brief sarcasm. I haven't done eight years of therapy and med management and gained a high level of self-awareness and self-education about my diagnoses to the point my therapist and med manager rarely question when I make these statements to have someone on the internet be like \"well obviously you have too many diagnoses to know\". Yes, in the beginning I had no idea which it was. I learned to tell with introspection, medication, and trial and error.\n\nI understand asking for help telling the difference or being curious how I can.

It's \"invisible\" on the outside and people who don't understand it have no idea how bad it can be. It significantly impacts the brain's ability to function and carry out normal everyday tasks.

One brother never got off the ground, he had a weird enmeshed relationship with their mother, never had a job and lived off her well into his 60s. She bought him a house as well which obviously ate into the inheritance for his siblings in a massive way, and my other uncle was devastated about it, even though he owns his own business and is doing well after years of struggles with his health and redundancies etc. Not because he needs the money but because of what it represents- deep childhood wounds of watching your parents treat your sibling differently to you and with more love and attention, attention and love you really really needed too, even if you didn\u2019t outwardly show it because you were able to \u2018get by\u2019 better.

Emma needs to learn to support herself and find other sources of support. \n\nLots of things could change (illness, divorce, etc) and you\u2019re making assumptions about Sam\u2019s future situation, again in favor of Emma. Maybe Emma will meet someone rich who wants to take care of her and HER situation will change for the better. The point is you have no idea. Favoritism, pure and simple. It\u2019s helping no one and hurting Sam. Isn\u2019t she your daughter too?", "YTA\u2026 Emma is clearly golden child. And you have zero idea what\u2019s going on in Sam\u2019s house or what her need for money is. You are assuming. She could be fine, or her husband could be an abusive (banned word), and the money would provide her and her children a way out. After years of neglecting Sam, do better.", "Yta. That money was your husbands too and together you decided 50/50. Backing out of the plan now is both unfair to both daughters because you are ruining their relationship preventing Emma from having a support system when you are gone. Also you are ignoring your late husbands wishes on what to do with the money he helped earn.", "YTA, it's not the money, it's about you giving 0 Fs about your daughter just because she seems alright compared to the other one, you can do whatever you want, it's your money, but don't complain if soon you only have one daughter willing to talk to you", "Yes. \n\nAlso Sam is independent because she had to be. She had no choice, living in the shadow of Emma\u2019s additional needs and having the lion\u2019s share of parental input and attention.\n\nFor that reason, YTA.", "And how much of Emma\u2019s issues are ADHD and how much is her life choices? I\u2019m not downplaying the effects of her issues, but at a certain point everyone needs to get the help they need, take responsibility, and provide for themselves. OP may well have enabled Emma instead of actually helping her. Why not provide therapy and assistance now to actually improve Emma\u2019s ability to improve her own life?", "THANK YOU!!!\n\nI was in a similar situation- my uncle in another state had health problems and I was asked to help with his will.  He was basically going to give my sister money but not me, because in his eyes, she needed it more since I was married.  In the end, he died before signing it and with the state laws, I didn\u2019t get anything then.\n\nBut let\u2019s break it down:\n\nYes, I am married and hubby makes decent money, and I am a SAHM.  But we also have 2 kids, a mortgage, my mom lives with us (sister to uncle), and we also support hubby\u2019s parents to an extent.\n\nMy sister (older than me) is single and lives in an inexpensive condo.\n\nYes, my hubby makes more than she does but it\u2019s not like we\u2019re rolling in the dough!  Plus I had expenses through flying down to take care of his estate and such.  It just felt like a slap in the face.", "Worth considering that Sam might have done well in academia and therefore life in an attempt to get the same recognition / love that her older sister got. \n\nI can easily see an ADHD Emma getting heaps of praise for just passing a test in high school (diagnosed in her teens), whereas Sam does well but gets nothing more than a cursory \"oh that's nice\", works even harder but still never gets that praise. Even ended-up with an eating disorder.", "I am neither of my parents fav child. My brother is clearly in need of the money way more then me. He will never have alot of earning power. I do not care if he Inherited the vast majority of my parents wealth because I know he will need it. Sam should have grown up knowing this and consider the consequences of her old sister having issues. Sam seems pretty self centered in my eyes", "Everyone keeps saying \u2018Sam getting sick is a hypothetical, Emma having ADHD is a reality\u2019 because they either didn\u2019t see OP\u2019s buried lede about Sam having an eating disorder before due to emotional abuse from the dad or because they don\u2019t understand eating disorders are an illness.\n\nRecovery from an ED are often life long and depending on the type of ED and other factors they can cause physical illness on top of *being a mental illness*.\n\nMy brother was undiagnosed ADHD and my parents also ignored my chronic physical illness and eating disorder. They were shit neglectful parents who harmed us each individually.\n\nBoth of us paid in adulthood to treat ourselves as both of us were disadvantaged by this. He is medicated I believe and struggles to undo some of the harmful habits going undiagnosed caused. I remember how as a kid he hated himself and felt like a lazy failure and I have compassion for that but even after he got diagnosed he is very bitter that he didn\u2019t get help sooner and nothing is enough. My entire family has helped him financially and he is on course to inherit. He was left with a lot to overcome no doubt. But he owns a house, runs a business, is married, dual income and got a degree.\n\nI paid for my entire ED treatment myself. I was homeless, my ED caused permanent bowel damage so I\u2019m having my third procedure under GA this weekend in four months, have had multiple surgeries, over 100 hospital admissions in my lifetime and spent large chunks of my time on social security dealing with my health which both caused and compounded and was compounded by my ED. And as I get older I am at risk of things like oestoporosis because of it.\n\nMy brother and family and people generally have less compassion for the reality of eating disorders which can be life threatening, do not have medication for them and often therapy and recovery is lifelong. A bit like ADHD\u2026\n\nSo the fact OP left out Sam\u2019s illness and the example of previous issues of perceived inequality choosing one condition over another in the sisters suggests the will is more like written confirmation of emotions for Sam. \n\nSome ED will be harder to overcome than some ADHD and vice versa. The fact Sam is married, working, has kids doesn\u2019t mean she will never have issues from it again. For example menopause can be a huge ED trigger in women. She may have medical risks and it can fuck up your insurance because it is a pre existing condition.\n\nI live in a country with free healthcare but it is patchy so I tried to get private healthcare as a back up. My ED and its impacts on my health made me unable to get any policy. And my step dad at the time was an insurance broker. So I have to pay out of pocket. My brother does not. There are so many ways we both still suffer from our shitty childhoods. It isn\u2019t a competition to me which had it worse but it is to him.\n\nWe are no contact because it was felt he needed the bigger inheritance while I should step in to support him as I had my shit together more because \u2018you got over your ED\u2019. I had to or I was going to die. It wasn\u2019t strength of character, it was consequences. My brother\u2019s consequences were not as stark and thus he waivered longer.\n\nMy \u2018reward\u2019 was to baby sit him while he got the inheritance. I noped out and cut them all out because it hurt feeling that comparison but it was point of no return to see it in one of the most important legal documents a family member will write that stands up in court. I did not expect to get exactly the same or even any money. I was also excluded like here from belongings.\n\nAnd to be told \u2018I don\u2019t care if you wanted things to remember us by because we don\u2019t think about you very much\u2019 was the breaking point. I can\u2019t imagine how I might feel if my family cut out my children in the same way as the lack of awareness of me passed down to them. My family and very many people assume I wanted money. I wanted a sign of love before they died and the chance was over. I wanted some acknowledgement. I may have decided (I might still if anything does get offered to me) that reparations in a will for the non monetary losses mattered.\n\nBut for me the will was just enshrining the dynamic in perpetuity and yup, that was when I gave up hope of well, a deathbed change. I find most people find it hard to realise it can be both about money and the symbolism of the money and hurt even if you might accept it in the end. Sam got one heads up and took some time out and commenters are ripping her apart.\n\nYTA for all those black and whites when families are shades of grey.", "Same. I have two brothers and both are far better off than me. Dad is leaving me more in the will but my brothers don\u2019t care. There\u2019s much more history to it than that (dad left when I was a baby, found later in life, likely guilt-driven, etc\u2026) but all the same. I get Sam might feel less loved but this isn\u2019t about \u201clove\u201d per se, it\u2019s about what could benefit each daughter after mom is gone.

Phrases like \"overachiever\" and \"eating disorder\" stand out to me because one of the ways that undiagnosed people with ADHD cope with the condition is by burning themselves out with perfectionism/getting things done to overcompensate for the shortcomings they don't know are there. It's also not unheard of to have an eating disorder alongside the condition and in fact there is an Olympic marathoner that has had to withdraw from some races while she and her doctors work to get the right medication for her OCD, ADHD, and ED so she can report the medication for her drug tests and be cleared to race.\n\nI guess what I'm getting at is that it's not entirely out of the picture that Sam might also have the condition but because her symptoms weren't as disruptive she wasn't diagnosed and didn't get the help and support she could have had.\n\nIt honestly sucks for everyone. ADHD is expensive to treat because it involves extensive testing to find out you have it as well as therapy and possibly medication. That medication is not cheap, is heavily controlled, and usually involves quarterly appointments to check in with the doctor about it. And that doesn't take into account the ways the condition affects jobs, relationships, and managing money. Emma probably could use a lot of help.\n\nIs Sam still justified in being upset? Absolutely.

Like they already own what they need to support themselves probably for a decade or two", "NTA, ultimately it\u2019s your money to decide. However I\u2019d take to offer another perspective.\n\nFirst off, I have ADHD. I was medicated in my teenage years but I have been unmedicated since I was 18. My ADHD makes things a lot harder but it doesn\u2019t define me. I was a military pilot, I have two Masters degrees from a Tier one university, my undergraduate degree from a tier two university, and a third masters from a smaller more regional school. I worked at a big four accounting firm and have a CPA license. I tell you all this so you know that ADHD, even unmedicated, is not a death sentence for success.\n\nSecondly, I identify with your family situation. I am the high performing sibling. My other sibling has not had much success in life. They flunked out of college, don\u2019t make a lot of money, and are not saving for the future. But they are happy as a clam living in the moment and playing video games.\n\nMy parents currently have the estate set to he 50/50. If they were to rearrange it 80/20 in favor of my sibling I would also be upset like Sam. I have worked very hard in high school and my adult years, followed the prescribed path, and very nearly followed in my fathers footsteps for the most part. I have sacrificed a lot of time, had a lot of heartache, and invested a lot of money to be where I am now. Why should my sibling suddenly be granted equal financial standing to me, when they haven\u2019t worked nearly as hard as me?\n\nMoreover, if my parents were to change the estate to 80/20, the 30% difference between 80/20 and 50/50 would be enough to cover my sons tuition at a tier one university (think Yale,  Harvard, Princeton, etc) 18 years from now. \n\nSo in short, Sam probably feels like they are being penalized for working hard and being successful and that Emma is unfairly getting a \u201cget out of jail free card\u201d. I get that Emma has ADHD, but as I stated above that is not a death sentence to success.", "This is though but as the \"good kid\" of a family, I always hated I am punished for me being good and succesful and my brother helped. I have to kids now and I do plan on being truly equal because of that resentment.\n\nYTA.", "The courts don\u2019t like uneven distribution of assets. And all wills are contestable.

That said, if you really want to help your daughter, than do it now, not when your dead.", "YTA and big time. I have a highly favored sibling and she has ADHD too. She uses drugs and gives away my parents medication to her friends. Although my mom gets angry at her, she continues to enable her and never punish her because she is \u201csick\u201d. She gets everything she wants, even if we have to put in the money for her as her older siblings. We were raised differently and we weren\u2019t allowed one misstep or we would get beaten and sweared at. \n\nThe favoritism you are showing will hurt the relationship between your daughters. And eventually, Sam will want nothing to do with you. For this reason, don\u2019t even try to rely on Sam when you get older to help you financially or emotionally because you clearly don\u2019t care about hers.", "Honestly I hate parents that completely ignore their \"well behaved\" children for their \"troubled\" ones. They are both your children and should be treated equally. You have babied Emma her entire life and it has done nothing for her, so I don't know how you think giving her all of the inheritance will change a damn thing.

I told him of course not. My brother is a good bit younger, works at a factory, and still lived at home. I have a good job, a family, and a home of my own. It made sense to me. But I do appreciate the fact that he sat me down and asked me. It made clear to me that this wasn\u2019t easy favoritism on his part\u2014that he was just trying to do the right thing and leave the earth knowing his kids were taken care of, one way or another. \n\nIt\u2019s likely Sam sees this move as part of a bigger pattern of you bailing out her sister at her own expense\u2014like, from her POV, maybe you never had to worry about Sam because she learned early on she had to overachieve to make up for what you weren\u2019t doing for her. I doubt that was the intention on your end, but people are understandably sensitive about this stuff. I wasn\u2019t because my dad always made me feel cherished. I grew up knowing that the money he spent wasn\u2019t a sign of his regard, and he was a s emotionally present for me as he was my younger brother. I mean, sure, I felt occasional jealousy, but as an adult with kids of my own, I could appreciate the situation for what it it was. \n\nNAH. I think you have to find a way to convince Sam that your estate isn\u2019t an indication of her worth. Maybe you could also make her executor and ask her if she\u2019s be willing to oversee a trust you establish for Emma, also paying her a fee for conducting that oversight.", "Is there a You Were TA and are now reaping the horrors?  From your own words, you have favored Emma all of her life.  Sam is upset because this seems like a concrete demonstration that you love her less than Emma.  She probably worked hard for her success in a vain attempt to earn your approval - which obviously will never arrive.  Forget the money for a moment - this is about emotions.  Can't you see that and address that?  Try to talk to Sam about your favoritism and how you regret your past actions, and instead of saying over and over that Sam doesn't need anything from you, say that you are very worried about Emma and trying to ensure her future.  Why do you have to dismiss Sam in order to talk about Emma's needs?\n\nAs a practical matter, a will is totally inadequate for your situation.  See an elderlaw attorney who can set up a special needs trust for Emma.  She is going to need someone to manage the money. It might make much more sense to sell the home and set up an income from the trust instead.  Dumping a probate estate on someone with severe ADHD is a crazy plan.  Make someone other than Sam the trustee - it isn't fair, given the emotional history, to make her responsible.  Even if she comes around, don't burden her with that.  What are your plans for your own power of attorney and medical poa?  Is Sam going to get all the burdens and none of the rewards?", "YTA. Your husband and you decided to do 50/50 . I Have adhd and I am very successful in life, having adhd is not an excuse. Does she have other problems as well? Like illness or mental issues? I understand your concern but you should treat you children equally . You don\u2019t know if the future Sam will divorce or will get a disease and she won\u2019t able to work. If I was Sam I would start to look for a retirement home for and cut all the ties and you wouldn\u2019t be able to see my babies", "You got it 100%. YTA OP for this right here.", ">If you really want to help the one help her while you are alive and not once you are dead.\n\nI agree with this, but not this.\n\n>Anytime inheritance is split any way other than equally between children it\u2019s a dick move. \n\nBeing a parent isn't about doing anything equally, it's about doing it in a way that best supports each kid. Birthday presents and Christmas gifts aren't perfect dollar to dollar matches in my house even. It's about where each kid is and what they'd really enjoy. We may try to ballpark the prices for some sense of fairness, but if, for example, one kid is ready for a new bike, that can be a big gift this year, while the other kid will get that or something similar when it's their turn.\n\nWell off sister is being an ass here. She has multiple houses, a husband that's a doctor, probably a couple mil in 401K and other funds, and she's pissed that relatively modest means Mom isn't giving her 50/50 of the estate? Give me a break. Clearly the right thing to do her is for ADHD kid to inherit the house and help protect her from housing insecurity over the long term and the house is likely the majority of the assets. If split more evenly, ADAH sister probably couldn't buy out well-off sister's share of the house.", "That\u2019s exactly what it is. Especially since she only acknowledges in a comment that her late husband wanted it 50/50 because he felt guilty giving Sam an eating disorder but OP sees that as \u201cno reason to keep it 50/50\u201d.\n\nETA: they also never got her help and she had to overcome it on her own.", "You're not getting paid what you're worth then", "I really wish you were my sister (or brother).\n\nI ended up with a narcissist for a sister...she and other family members took advantage of our grandparents and my father and I ended up getting screwed out of any inheritance due to their actions.\ud83d\ude12", "Very insightful comment. \n\nA connection between ADHD and eating disorders had never occurred to me. I googled it and saw some links mentioned also.\n\nhttps://psychcentral.com/adhd/adhd-and-eating-disorders\n\nAnecdotally, now that you mention it, the person I know with ADHD has a hidden ED.\n\nI also noticed a link between ADHD and perfectionism mentioned. Perfectionism can hold a person back but maybe Sam found out how to make that work for her. \n\nSo maybe you're right. Maybe Sam also has ADHD, just manifesting differently. She could have really, really struggled too but without support as the parents may have already decided that Emma was the one who needed special attention. That would really hurt.\n\nYour parents, no offence, are really being enormous AHs in regards to you and how they treat you. (Which is how I'm feeling about OP). How can they let their vision be so cloudy and treat their children so unequally? You're right, parents do play favourites and it's so hurtful. You'd think they'd learn. I'm sorry you've been abandoned to deal with it by yourself. That's bad enough but then to see how they were/are financially more than capable of helping you but choose not to, ouch. Sorry, the injustice is real and your parents officially suck. Good luck with everything.\n\n*I wish all parents would post on AITA to get reality checks.*", "There are no winners here.  The other daughter also did her best and has been punished with neglect for her success.", "I agree. Probably because I'm the benefactor in this situation but I know my dad is giving me more money in his will. I'm the product of \"second marriage to a younger woman who wanted kids\". My half siblings are significantly older than me and bought houses while I was still a teenager and either have families or chose not too. \n\nIm still renting with no way of saving (high cost city but where the jobs are) and I was ranting to my dad about something like how nice it'd be to paint walls without needing permission for the rest of my life. He admitted I'm getting more because my siblings are set up and I'm not. I did argue that he could leave more for his grandkids if he really wanted to set someone set up but he said they're included in the will and to never mention it again because he's decided. \n\nTbh, it made me very uncomfortable to know. I'm dreading the will reading (and obviously his death) because I have a great relationship with my siblings and I really hope they see it as a father helping the kid in a less fortunate situation rather than any favoritism.", "Yeah, is amazing they have any relationship at all!", "YTA. You\u2019ve had blantant favoritism for Emma all through Sam\u2019s life. They are BOTH your children. Where they are at in life should have nothing to do with the fact THEY ARE BOTH YOUR CHILDREN. It should be 50/50 regardless of all that stuff you spewed out trying to justify your crappy stance on things.", "YTA. That's awfull for Emma, but even more so for Sam. Sam being an overachiever and top of her class was probably to get more attention from her parents that apparently she hardly got. In homes where one kid has a deficiency and/or some kind of developmental issues it's common for the healthy sibling to feel neglected, forgotten and made to concede a lot during childhood and teenage years. If you are worried about Emma living situation leave her the house, but if it is sold later on, make the proceedings to be split 50/50. That would be fairer.", "I agree with everything here. Op YTA.", "I think equity > equality.\n\nAs long as she assures Sam that, should things change, the will can be changed to reflect her needs, then NTA makes the most sense.\n\nParents want to know *both* kids will be okay after they pass. As of now, Sam is good. At her point in life, she wouldn't need any help at all. She's still getting something because its an inheritance. But OP is trying to make sure they're both okay.\n\nI have a brother who needs the inheritance more than me due to his mental health needs. I would never be upset if my parents had the inheritance favor him. It has nothing to do with loving him more. It's because they love us both unconditionally and they want us both to not struggle. I am already not struggling. They've helped me get to this point. So, I would not weaponize that against my brother just because he needs more than me.\n\nLike I said, when you care about a lot of people, equity > equality", "I feel like this is going to get downvoted or dismissed, but beyond the material element, there's a sentimental consideration that might be painful for Sam. Their mom is gifting most of the actual family legacy to Emma -- the house that either both girls grew up in, or that they've spent the most recent time with their mother in; the car that will still smell like her, etc. When my grandparents passed away, they died in debt, and there was still a lot of hurt feelings associated with who took the pictures, the business cards, the little scraps of stuff lying around the house because that was what we had to remember them by, and people who walked away with nothing felt like they were less connected to my grandparents. It's not an entirely rational thought, but it is a real one, and one worth considering.", "And yet this sub was bending over backwards to defend an OP kicking out her sister from her home after inheriting everything from their Grandfather...", "Sounds like this has been an ongoing issue, though. That conversation would just have acknowledged to Sam that she\u2019s not a priority to OP.", "Medication does not cure ADHD. It helps manage some symptoms for the time that the medication is active in the body. And it doesn\u2019t work for everyone. Please stop speaking like this, you obviously don\u2019t understand the disorder, we are not just lazy or lacking ambition. We have a disability.\n\nI\u2019m a pretty lucky case, have two degrees and am training to be a barrister. But I would never have gotten here if it wasn\u2019t for my parents\u2019 help, even as it is I\u2019m like 2 years behind because I was only diagnosed at 25, and suffered a lot until then. I am smart, talented, I want to thrive, but I can\u2019t always get there because my brain does not function the same, and the world is not built with my brain in mind. Emma will always have ADHD, will always struggle, doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s \u201cplaying the ADHD card\u201d. No one would choose to live like this I promise you. Please don\u2019t make all these assumptions.", "This is a hugely ignorant statement. ADHD impacts people differently and many people are unable to physically tolerate medication, and even if they can take medication it is in no way a cure. There are some things that can make it easier, and some people have a much easier time of it, but it can be hugely debilitating. And the amount of effort someone with ADHD is putting in to achieve these lesser results is often much higher than the amount of effort someone without ADHD puts in to get more.\n\nEmma's 80% of everything at some amorphous time in the future sounds like a hell of a lot less than what Sam already has, this whole argument is just bizarre to me.", "OP is TA. Why should the younger one be punished for being successful? Especially if she's been neglected most of her life.", "Cool, but it isn't that way for everyone.  I literally cannot turn off my mind due to my ADHD and anxiety, which go hand in hand so I am constantly fatigued and fidgety. I can't do a full clean sweep of my house because I get distracted.  Yes, my mom did put some systems in place when I was a kid because she didn't want me put on a heavy dose of meds, but now as a 30 something professional,  juggling a career, marriage, social life with ADHD, depression and anxiety just became too much.", "I\u2019m very grateful they took care of things this way.  They\u2019ve also been very with me about it, which I appreciate.  OP should invest the money and discuss with a good estrange planning lawyer.\n\nSome parents expect the healthy sibling will become a caregiver but also don\u2019t consider there\u2019s a power differential in these situations.  The \u201cSam\u201d in the situation can easily take advantage of the \u201cEmma.\u201d  The trust protects \u201cEmma.\u201d   Every situation is different, but the Emma sibling can have very complex feelings towards the Sam sibling.  My sibling has expressed feeling deeply inadequate compared to me.  If I was the trustee it would just make those feelings even more complicated.  A non-relative trustee can preserve the sibling dynamic.   \n\nI see so much of my situation in Sam and Emma. My siblings disabilities are invisible and I know people perceive them as lazy rather than needing accommodations.   I\u2019m not a saint, and sometimes it does seem unfair.  It can seem that I earn and work for everything but they get given so much by our parents.   These situations are tough for everyone involved.  Ultimately though, I try and remember that in the end it\u2019s toughest for the person moving with disabilities navigating a world built for able bodied and neurotypical people.", "OP also acknowledges that if she lives into her 80s there won\u2019t be much of anything left.

I\u2019ve gotten by and haven\u2019t asked for help and it\u2019s been hard and internally I\u2019ve got some serious anxiety issues and self esteem problems but I took care of myself. My brothers were always getting checked on and help with groceries etc I can confirm there is definitely some resentment that I was left out and felt cared for less sometimes even though I understood the reasoning. I kept it to myself. When my dad passed he still split everything evenly between us. While I personally wouldn\u2019t make a big deal because I don\u2019t feel entitled to my dads stuff after he\u2019s passed, I would still be silently hurt.
