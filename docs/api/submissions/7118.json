My husband died of a stroke 2 years ago and he left everything to me. I\u2019m rewriting my will as well in case something happens to me. Originally everything was split 50/50 between the girls but now I\u2019m splitting about 80/20 in favor of Emma. \n\nEmma has ADHD and isn\u2019t doing great in life. In those days everyone just assumed she was lazy and she didn\u2019t get the help children today get until she was in her teens. She just managed to finished high school and is working at a retail store as a stocker. It\u2019s backbreaking and she doesn\u2019t have much in the way of savings or anything. Her car was her father\u2019s when he passed.\n\nSam is works in tech as a project manager and her husband is a doctor. They live in a million dollar house and has 2 kids. I\u2019m not worried about Sam she\u2019s always been very capable and excelled at everything. She was always the overachiever and I don\u2019t think she needs help financially. Her and her husband probably take home $500k after taxes a year.\n\nI want Emma to inherit the house and car when I pass. I think it will be good for her because she can live in it or sell it and buy another one. Sam will be fine and her and her husband have several houses and a summer home. But Sam is angry with me because I\u2019ve made it clear that Emma gets most of our belongings. The bank savings and stocks will go to Sam but if I live to 80s she won\u2019t have too much probably 20-30% of what the house is worth. But I think it\u2019s fair because she is doing much better.\n\nSam called me to yell at me saying I\u2019m favoring Emma. I reminded her of how much worse off Emma is than her but she said since they were both my daughters she should get things 50/50 or it\u2019s favouritism. She reminded me that growing up we always spent more on Emma than her. But that\u2019s because she was at the top of her class while Emma was failing. I put Emma in extra tutoring and the like because she needed it more. She said I should will half of the inheritance to her children for college funds but I reminded her she makes more and can save for them. I told her it\u2019s not about me favoring Emma over her but Emma is worse off and she will be fine which resulted in her hanging up and refusing to come over for Christmas.", "created_utc": 1673498924, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109qmli/aita_for_giving_one_daughter_more_inheritance/", "score": 383, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, will one daughter be an executor? Have power of attorney? Be involved in future elder care? If so, does your split of assets align with which daughter you'd want in those roles?", "YTA. You need to meet with an elder law attorney in your state who does special needs planning. Leaving almost everything to your ADHD daughter who may not be able to do backbreaking work until she retires could disqualify her from government benefits like Medicaid if she might ever need them. There may be a way to leave them both equal shares but in a way that keeps your daughter with ADHD eligible for benefits.\n\nAlso, your successful daughter may fall on hard times. Her husband could leave her, she could have an accident that disables her. Does she not deserve the same financial cushion that your other daughter does? Know that if you leave her anything but 50% of your estate it will complicate her grief when you die and lead to unresolvable trauma. I know, I\u2019m living it now and it\u2019s very painful. Do you want to knowingly inflict that pain on her?", "Yta \nSam just wants for once to be equal\nYeah it\u2019s your money but this is going to fail miserably in all relationships", "YTA. There's a story similar to this one that's about a year old, in which the mother willed everything to the son with ADHD and left her daughter with nothing, but also wanted the daughter to be the executor of the will. She was flabbergasted when her daughter got upset. \n\nThis isn't about the money or assets. It's about the rampant favoritism on your part. The fact that you rewrote the will after their father could no longer have a say is a clear indicator that you've been playing favorites with Emma her whole life, and you want it to continue even after you're gone. I hope you don't get too attached to Sam's kids, because I have a strong feeling you won't be seeing them very much after this.", "YTA not for the inheritance but clearly you have always put the other sister on the back burner.  Your other daughter doesn't need money what she probably wants is equal love and attention.\n\nEdit to add in seeing responses from OP\nNope you're straight up the AH.  You paid to give her the best tutors.  You're paying half her rent currently and her therapist You absolutely do favor her and she got the dad's car currently.  Name five things you've done for the other one.\n\nThink possibly you've enabled her to live off of you?", "Info: What if anything would your husband have had to say about this situation?", "Info: is favoring Emma in the will worth losing your relationship with Sam?  That is where you\u2019re headed. It seems like Emma has been favored their entire lives and this is the straw that broke the camels back.", "You know this likely isn't about the money, right?\n\nSam understandably feels like you care more about Emma than her. For whatever reasons, good or bad, Emma has received more help, more attention, and more consideration from you and your husband for their whole lives. Many will extrapolate that to amount of love/care. Sam likely feels that you love Emma more and that no matter what she does, you're always going to favor her sister. Maybe it's irrational, maybe it's not. But those are normal human feelings, and they're valid.\n\nYour intentions are well-meaning, and a rational, unbiased person would understand why you're wanting to provide more financially for Emma, but you do need to recognize what message you're actually sending to Sam if you go this route. You can explain your reasons to Sam all you want, but it's irrelevant to someone who already feels like they're second. Sam is going to feel hurt and resentful because yet again, it's a sign that Mom loves and favors Emma more. You should also be aware that once you're gone, Sam won't want much to do with Emma. This is the kind of thing that drives wedges through families for decades. \n\nNo judgement", "YTA. So you mean to tell me Emma has *always* gotten more by your own admission, your husband caused Sam to have an eating disorder, and despite (or in spite) being pushed aside for your favorite Emma, Sam has come out financially and emotionally stable while the child you favored is still failing? \n\nAlso someone else pointed out, I certainly hope you\u2019re making Emma the one to be power of attorney. She gets everything so she should be in charge of your care. Don\u2019t take away from Sam and then expect her to do anything for you when it sounds like you haven\u2019t done anything for her. \n\nMoney changes. Sam could lose everything, Emma could get her shit together. Who knows. What Sam currently knows is that she will never be treated as well as her sister, not even in your death.", "I really want to know what happens", "It\u2019s your choice but it\u2019s not fair and will create animosity. Different life choices created different circumstances. So Sam is supposed to be punished because of her life choices? Does Emma have a learning disability too because I know plenty of highly successful people with ADHD. I think you need to split 50/50.", "YTA - it is favouritism whether you think it is or not. Based on Sam\u2019s reaction, this is something that has been a pattern for her entire life, and it\u2019s clear that she holds some resentment that you favoured her sister so much in childhood. Yes Emma needed extra help, but did that extra help result in you neglecting Sam?", "Slight YTA.  I'm on the side that it should be fair regardless their personal achievements.\n\nBoth can inherit the house with the stipulation that Emma be allowed to continue to live there but if the house is sold it is split between the two.  In our situation, the attorney drew up a cotenancy agreement.  You should check into it.", "NAH\n\nI don't think you're an asshole for choosing equity here, one child clearly needs more help. That said, I don't think your daughter is an asshole either. There is clearly a lot of built up resentment and I can see why. You did your best, the same way my parents did, but when you spend your whole life watching your sibling get more attention, time, and care than you, because they need more help, resentment builds. My brother was the problem child who needed extra care and I was the child who could be independent. Partially because my parents spent so much time on my brother that I had to be. That doesn't mean I didn't want help from them or just their time. To your daughter, this is just another moment of you choosing her sister. She can't see past the pain to realize that this is actually fair.", "Why not help Emma now? Why wait until you die?\n\nShe's only 32, her quality of life can atoll be improved  with the right professional assistants, help, ...\n\n\nAfter that you can just split 50/50. So Sam still wants to help Emma after you are gone.\n\nIt's  not nice of Sam either, she shouldn't yell at you.\n\nESH except Emma.", "YTA\n\n>Emma has ADHD and isn\u2019t doing great in life. In those days everyone just assumed she was lazy and she didn\u2019t get the help children today get **until she was in her teens.** \n\nEmma got \"extra help and the like\" growing up and Emma got \"the help children get today\" starting in her teens. Sam did not get either of those things, because she did was doing well in school. And it sounds like Emma probably got more of your attention and emotional resources too, because Sam was \"easy.\"\n\n Emma is now 32. Not 18. Not 25. 32. \n\n>is working at a retail store as a stocker. It\u2019s backbreaking and **she doesn\u2019t have much in the way of savings or anything.** **Her car was her father\u2019s** when he passed.\n\nEmma already received your husband's car. What did Sam get when he died? Do you have full access to and knowledge of Emma's finances? Maybe she spends carelessly or chooses not to work hard. Perhaps because she knows that you will always bail her out.\n\nMeanwhile\n\n>She was always the overachiever and **I don\u2019t think** she needs help financially. Her and her husband **probably** take home $500k after taxes a year.\n\nSo you generally have no clue about Sam? Sam has two kids and is 29 years old. Maybe Sam's kids will need help paying for college. \n\nAny way you slice it, you are absolutely favoring Emma. It's delusional to suggest otherwise.  If your true goal is to \"help\" Emma out, because you think she might be destitute once you're gone, and if Emma is as terrible with money (and adulting) as your post suggests, put everything into a trust with Sam and Emma as equal beneficiaries and let both daughters receive passive income and Sam have control over distributing the principal, since you have no way of knowing that Emma won't spend everything at once. Or acknowledge that you favor Emma.", "YWBTA\nI\u2019d advise you to figure out a way to help Emma financially now, and split the inheritance 50/50. She has a neurocognitive learning disorder that will never go away, but hospitals and courtrooms and businesses everywhere are literally filled with successful professionals with ADHD. Give me a break- I\u2019m 54 with ADHD that was diagnosed a year ago and everyone told me I was lazy, too. I have an advanced degree and a great career and my valedictorian sibling was, and remains, the favorite. I\u2019m much better off financially than my sibling. \nCircumstances can and do change- Sam could get divorced or her husband could be an alcoholic gambler in 15 years, someone could get sick or in a terrible accident or sued- who knows. They are both your children, and I\u2019d bet Sam is having a gut reaction not because of entitlement but because it\u2019s reinforcing the painful message she got growing up - loud and clear- that she was on her own. That sucks. That would be the legacy you\u2019d leave more than any money.", "Side note - how capable is Emma of using the money responsibly if she has a lot of difficulty in everyday life? Just giving her everything may not be the favor you think it is. Maybe a trust or something with more oversight would be a better fit for her?", "YTA. There are no guarantees in life. Something could happen and both daughters could end up needing help. Sounds like Emma always got more. ADHD is not an excuse to be less. My son is the same age as Emma and was diagnosed with ADHD at age 6. He\u2019s bought a house, married with 2 children and thriving. Maybe you should concentrate on working with Emma to help her get the tools she needs to thrive - additional schooling, etc. Sam should not be made to feel less than because she doesn\u2019t have ADHD.", "YTA. It\u2019s not *actually* about money. It\u2019s that the division of assets is a stark reminder that Sam was treated differently and she feels that you have never treated HER fairly. My sibling has extreme dyslexia and also Asperger\u2019s. They cannot hold a job and are legally disabled. They get the house when my parents pass.\n\nIn exchange, my other sibling and I are getting a third of the value of the home in cash. I am arguably more well-off than either of my siblings (and, by the way, I was just diagnosed with ADHD later than Emma). \n\nHoweverrrr.. I could care less if they willed everything to my quote unquote worse off sibling. Because I know and feel that my parents have always loved us equally. Since Sam is so angry, you need to do some introspection to figure out why if you stand a chance of repairing your relationship. If at all possible.", "This isn't about finances. It's about a sibling being favoured over the other her W H O L E L I F E. The penalty of being better in life is an excuse for the mother to use.", "YTA. You are already guaranteeing that as soon as your die your family will break up and girls will be er talk again.", "I don't know, I flip between YTA and NTA. On one hand it's your choice, on the other, your husband's will had other directions. \n\nI'm going to share a few comments also... \n1) You're setting them up for hurt and fighting when you die (if not sooner). Although apparently family fighting around wills is common, so maybe there is nothing to be done. \n2) Why not focus in equity, what does Emma need for future security and stability. Example, maybe Emma gets the physical house, but some of the items are split. \n3) Sam mentions belongings, maybe there are some items you own that are important to her. Why not find out what those are?", "ESH: The intent isn't wrong, but your plan of action is. You could place most of this in a trust for Emma since she's so behind, but you shouldn't show such obvious favoritism. I get leaving her the house and the car, that makes sense... but other finances should be more evenly split.", "I always think these are the kind of decisions that tear families apart. It often translates as favouritism, no matter your rationale or intentions. Also, no-one can predict the future. Emma could win Lotto tomorrow, and equally Sam could have a life mishap that results in financial distress. So don't base it on current situations, base it on they are both your daughters, loved equally, and should share the inheritence.  Split it 50/50 otherwise YTA", "YTA. \n\nNot necessarily about the split itself, but everything about how you talked to Sam. Clearly there is some long standing feelings of being overlooked, and the way you shut her down was incredibly insensitive.", "YTA, only because going from 50/50 to 80/20 is a drastic change in the inheritance.  Especially, if the 80/20 is basically money and then she gets the house and car on top of that.  That would ruffle a lot of feathers.  You can't fault Sam and punish her because she has a great life.  Anymore than you can award Emma because of the guilt you feel about her health.\n\nI think your guilt is the culprit here.  You should look inside yourself.  Maybe discuss it with a therapist.  When you do a will, you shouldn't tell anyone what's in it.  There will be a day they find out.  Hopefully, if you decide to change things, you will know enough to keep things to yourself.", "Ooooft this is a tough one. My sibling is the same - my parents have always worried about him but in turn he hasn\u2019t learned to cope on his own. I\u2019d be livid if my parents left him the same split as you\u2019re intending to do.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with 50/50? Surely there will still be enough for Emma to buy a home with 50% of your estate. Even 60/40 in Emma\u2019s favour would be more decent. 80/20 is a jump.\n\nYTA", "I\u2019m actually in this situation with my mum. My sister is struggling and a single parent. My mum asked me how I felt if she gave more to my sister on the will by revising the original will which was 50/50. I actually supported her decision and suggested that it could be split between the nieces and nephews or do a trust. My sister has ADHD, PTSD and chronic depression. I know my parents love me and I love my sister and her kids. My husband and I do not need it. That\u2019s the thing I think your daughter who is well off is missing the point that you\u2019re making. You want to give to your daughter who is struggling the house and car because she would need it, meanwhile the one really could sell one of her other homes and put that as a college fund for her kids. It\u2019s not about favoritism. NTA", "I think there is another issue here. What did the father want?\n\nWas this discussed with him before he died? Because if his will said, 'everything to my wife unless she predeceases me and in that case 50/50 to my children'...then surely his wishes should be taken into account too?", "NTA but I\u2019m against 80/20 split. I highly suggest putting anything for Emma in a trust. My experience working with ADHD individuals is that they can be incredibly impulsive and don\u2019t think things through. I fear Emma may blow through any inheritance or sell the house and squander that cash. I would NOT make Sam the executor of your estate or have her manage the trust. Furthermore, I would completely bypass Sam and bequeath directly to your grandchildren.", "I understand and empathize with both sides but I gotta ask; why did you feel the need to put this information out now? \n\nWhy take the chance of ruining your relationship with Sam and by extension your grand children? It\u2019s almost as if you wanted to fight about money. Timing and consideration are important. \n\nSam\u2019s pissed because you favored Emma her whole life and you intend to continue this trend even after you cross the rainbow bridge. \n\nEmma doesn\u2019t have the same opportunities as Sam and will need help after you\u2019re gone. I get that but that\u2019s not what Sam is hearing. Sam\u2019s resentment is rooted in childhood disappointments. \n\nShe does sound greedy but I think she\u2019s reacting more from a lifetime of being overlooked, pushed aside, or sacrificed. That I get. \n\nYou made a mess and complicated that mess by broadcasting your intention to continue the unequal treatment. \n\nYou may want to structure Emma\u2019s inheritance so that she doesn\u2019t get everything at once. Sounds like she could burn through it if there\u2019s no limits. Sam would have been the person to help out here but you\u2019ve fucked that up. \n\nParents who favor one child over another suck. You are an asshole for treating your children differently and continuing to disappoint the one you ignored.", "YTA for now, sam is living comfortably. But a lot can change before you die. You're assuming that Emma will never get her life together and will never marry or have kids or be financially stable. You have no way to know that when you die she will need these things more than Sam does. \nYour best bet is to do 50/50. Because they are equals. Neither more deserving or less deserving because they're both your children.", "YTA for how it sounds like you went about it. Favoritism hurts. Unless your kid has a debilitating disability or chronic illness, which ADHD is often not, it's best not to leave one kid more than another. Setting up a trust fund with specific conditions could be a lot better.  People are also often over extended when they buy homes because they aren't smart with money.  Idk sounds like this is a lifelong problem where you've always been kind of harder on Sam.", "YTA. I feel as though your punishing Sam for being successful and you should split it 50/50.", "I'm going with YTA but I might be biased. My mum is leaving everything to my brother because he makes terrible decisions and she thinks he needs extra help.\n\n He bought a house he can't afford, traded his brand new car in for a hunk of junk because he wanted to go off roading and his fiance doesn't want to work and prefers to watch TV all day while they struggle financially. He's always been bailed out of trouble and babied. Does he deserve an inheritance more than me? \n\nI actually told my mum I'm fine with her leaving everything to him but don't ask me for help so she had no one to look after her when she had surgery cos he didn't want to.", "Just going to add that my parents willed more to my brother because he was struggling with grades, keeping a job and had ADHD and behavioral issues and I was an overachiever with a good job a stable relationship. Now, a couple of years after my parents died, I'm the one with serious medical conditions (Narcolepsy AND Epilepsy), an ex-husband who took most of our money, a son with special needs, and I'm struggling to stay employed. I understand giving one kid more money than the other but it's how you went about it. Plus, you can't see the future. Setting up a trust to provide for both daughters in the case of unemployment, medical issues, or other foreseeable problems is super doable.", "I'm leaning NAH. I'll explain:\n\nYou sound like you have valid, well-thought-out reasons for the split you've decided on, but I can honestly see why Sam might be upset.\n\nI really think it sounds like there are deeper and more longstanding issues that need to be addressed here. It sounds like Sam may have some deeper unresolved issues due to a difference in attention and resources (real or perceived) growing up or from feeling like her reward for digging a better ditch is being given a better shovel while watching her (from her perspective) ne'er do well sister be handed everything on a plate. That may or may not reflect the objective reality of the situation but feelings are feelings. \n\nIt's your money and you can do what you want, but you should probably consider that there may be emotional dynamics at play that go well beyond the money, or maybe even have nothing to do with it. Sam may just want to feel like she's equal in your eyes and may have some unresolved issues as to the treatment of her vs. her sister. Being at the top of her class may well have not been as easy for her as you thought.\n\nI really think it sounds like there are deeper and more longstanding issues that need to be addressed here. Then, you might be able to approach the subject of the inheritance without unrelated and unresolved hurt feelings getting in the way.", "YTA. The truth is, you don\u2019t know what the future holds. Sam could get in an accident and become disabled, get divorced, have a stroke, any number of scenarios\u2026you have *no idea* what her future needs are. And yet, you just expect her life to always be good because *you* have decided she has it easy. Do you know how hard that girl worked to get where she is? And it sounds like she got precious little help from you to do it, by your own admission. \n\nThis is what your girl hears from you: no matter how perfect you are, you\u2019re never good enough; sister will always get more from me because reasons. You will lose Sam if you don\u2019t stop this nonsense. \n\n*Parents should never play favorites, no matter the circumstances.*\n\nP.S. A will is your final comment to your children from the grave. Is this really the last word you want Sam to hear from you?", "I was going to say YNTA for doing what you think is equitable but then I was like what went on when you were raising your daughters that Sam got an eating disorder from her father and resents her sister enough that she wouldn\u2019t share an inheritance when she is clearly not in dire straits and then I was like yeah, maybe we\u2019re not getting all the info here. \n\nLike\u2026 I would be so disappointed in myself if I raised my daughter to be as selfish as Sam that I would never blame her alone for being upset. I would be like, where did I fail as a parent. \n\nOn the other hand, if Sam was under the impression she would be getting a specific inheritance from her father her and her husband may not have been saving for specific items under the impression they would be filled by that inheritance\u2014 ie college funds and the like. \n\nYour intent is fine but because there\u2019s obviously missing backstory and I don\u2019t like the response about your husband and Sam, I\u2019m going to say YTA unless you want to clarify other aspects of this.", "I have had severe ADHD my whole life, only recently medicated. Got all A\u2019s whilst being raised part-time in a cult beforehand. YTA. Also, all the comments saying otherwise are valid, but Emma is 32. Common guys.", "Anytime inheritance is split any way other than equally between children it\u2019s a dick move. It sets siblings up to resent each other and no matter the intent shows favoritism. If you really want to help the one help her while you are alive and not once you are dead.\n\nSomething else to think about, giving someone who may be bad with money more money doesn\u2019t always go the way intended and may actually cause more issues for that person.", "YTA\n\nIf the house is sold and split, surely ADHD daughter can buy something suitable with that money. She doesn\u2019t need \u201c80%\u201d, she just needs enough to be comfortable.\n\nYes, I agree daughter making a killing should be more flexible on who gets what. But that doesn\u2019t mean taking away such a significant portion of the inheritance.\n\nIf my parents pulled this BS I\u2019d be pissed.", "YTA- you mentioned in a comment that your husband split if 50/50 because he gave Sam an earring disorder. It seems like Sam has never really gotten support from either of her parent\u2019s so don\u2019t be surprised when she cuts all contact with you.", "As someone who is a scapegoat child, ESH.\n\nThe child not used to having money also won't have a clue how to manage a windfall, so all that cash, assets and the house will soon be reduced to nothing when you're gone anyway, unless the other, more capable child has an incentive not to let everything you ever had completely crash and burn.\n\nYou're punishing one daughter for her achievements.\n\nA compromise would be to split everything but the house equally, write it in the will so the underachieving golden child still has somewhere to live, but also give the capable daughter a small stake in the property so if anything happens, she can ensure the house is kept in a liveable state.", "YTA 100% I will never understand why parents think because one kid is doing well they should be punished for it. What if your other daughter has some life altering situation happen where she ends up worse off? Writing a will off the current situation is incredibly short-sighted. Do you want your daughters to have a relationship when you pass? Because the way your will is set up-they will definitely not.", "YTA- Emma is irresponsible and has no ambition. Ask yourself honestly what she would do with those assets? You have no idea what Sam\u2019s actual situation is and that money might help and it might just be a bonus. You have always favored Emma and it shows", "im gonna say from experience it should be split 50-50.. if not it will be problematic, problem for you now bc sam now wont come over for holidays or maybe she will decide you cant see your grandkids\u2026 later when you are gone she will probably have no contact with emma\u2026\n\nIts best just to do 50-50.. as someone else said , you dont know what may happen years down the road\u2026", "YTA. It feels like you\u2019re punishing Sam for doing well in life. \n\nThere\u2019s not reason it shouldn\u2019t be 50/50.

It\u2019s not about the money. OP is showing favouritism to the same child she\u2019s always shown favouritism to. She describes Sam as an \u201coverachiever.\u201d Kids often go that route to please parents who don\u2019t show them enough affection. \n\nEven if that\u2019s not the case here, why would OP tell Sam about the arrangement? What did she expect would happen? Even if Sam loves her sister, can\u2019t OP understand how hurtful that is? OP could\u2019ve handled this much more delicately but clearly she had some sort of bizarre point to make to her younger daughter. Why?", "YTA. So you admit you raised your daughters unfairly, coddling one over the other and giving her more.

She just finished high school and is working at a retail store as a stocker. It\u2019s backbreaking and she doesn\u2019t have much in the way of savings or anything. Her car was her father\u2019s when he passed.\n\nSam is works in tech as a project manager and her husband is a doctor. They live in a million dollar house and has 2 kids. I\u2019m not worried about Sam she\u2019s always been very capable and excelled at everything. She was always the overachiever and I don\u2019t think she needs help financially. Her and her husband probably take home $500k after taxes a year.\n\nI want Emma to inherit the house and car when I pass. I think it will be good for her because she can live in it or sell it and buy another one. Sam will be find and her and her husband have several houses and a summer home. But Sam is angry with me because I\u2019ve made it clear that Emma gets most of our belongings. The bank savings and stocks will go to Sam but if I live to 80s she won\u2019t have too much probably 20-30% of what the house is worth. But I think it\u2019s fair because she is doing much better.\n\nSam called me to yell at me saying I\u2019m favoring Emma. I reminded her of how much worse off Emma is than her but she said since they were both her daughter\u2019s she should get things 50/50 or it\u2019s favouritism. She said I should will half of the inheritance to her children for college funds but I reminded her she makes more and can save for them. I told her it\u2019s not about me favoring Emma over her but Emma is worse off and she will be fine which resulted in her hanging up and refusing to come over for Christmas.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She never told my sister about the change in the will or used it as a way to manipulate things. Anyway, my sis and the scumbag broke up on their own for their own reasons and some time later my parents amended their will.

Sure, it\u2019s your money, but you are favoring Emma over Sam. Sam doesn\u2019t deserve to be punished for their success. Emma doesn\u2019t deserve to be favored for failing. Your kids will resent each other forever and it\u2019s just not fair. Yes yes, life isn\u2019t fair, but if you can make one portion more fair, why not??", "YTA\n\nafter reading all your comments, etc - yep, you're the asshole.  You absolutely favour Emma, and how is giving her non-liquid assets going to help her at all?  How will she pay the taxes, upkeep, etc?\n\nHonestly, sell the house and car, split it 60/40, and have it in trust for Emma if you absolutely must do something like that.   Don't be surprised when Sam stops talking to you, either.", "I think everyone needs to look at OP\u2019a comments. Sam had an eating disorder as a teen apparently, her father didn\u2019t like her (which OP frames as not getting along and contributing to the ED), and from the way she talks about Sam as a person makes it clear OP doesn\u2019t like Sam either. My guess is Sam was an oopsie and they made sure she knew it without them ever saying the words out loud to her. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about the money to Sam. It\u2019s about Sam still trying to convince herself that her parents did love her even though their actions have made it extremely questionable. It\u2019s about how she excelled and overcame an ED (probably on her own from the way OP avoids answering the question of if she paid for Sam\u2019s treatment or not) all on her own while her parents enabled and doted on Emma. This reeks of clear favoritism. \n\nNow! Before people come for me, Emma is honestly just as much a victim of her parents \u201cparenting\u201d. They didn\u2019t prepare her for adulthood and instead of getting her ACTUAL help like inpatient care, OP just enables the bad parts of Emma\u2019s mental health. No, I\u2019m not saying OP needs to leave Emma to be homeless. But if she\u2019s barely functioning, that\u2019s a serious issue. OP seems to think giving her a house she owns outright will help. But homes fully paid off can still be taken if taxes go unpaid for years. I bet my bottom dollar that OP reminds Emma to pay her half of the rent otherwise Emma would forget (ADHD brain fog affects memory significantly). \n\nOP, YTA. Not just for the obvious favoritism but also for the huge disservice you\u2019ve done to Emma in getting her fully prepared for adulthood. Get Emma enrolled in some inpatient or intensive outpatient care programs, call a family estate lawyer and set up a dispenser trust for both, and split it between them based on the lawyers recommendation. The anger from Sam isn\u2019t about the finances.", "This is a tough one. I understand both the mother's perspective and the daughter's. Personally if it was me and I was doing well, I'd let my other sibling get the majority of the inheritance, but I can see why the younger daughter is upset. If OP did anything wrong, it's that she didn't discuss it with the more successful sibling first.", "Yes yta and you are definitely showing her you favour Emma!", "YTA. You\u2019re punishing Sam for being successful. What happens if her life takes a drastic turn? Universe forbid, but severe illness, disability, divorce, being widowed would drastically alter her life and ability to support herself and her children. I was in my mid thirties and a health care professional when I was injured at work and became disabled. \n\nYou are favouring one child, and from your comments, it\u2019s a lifetime commitment.", "NTA. Mom can do with HER estate as she pleases.", "NAH.\n\nDo whatever you want.  However, unless you're planning to die in the next 25 years, neither of them will benefit from it in any meaningful way.  Emma, whatever issues she might have, is still going to have to figure out how to live her life without the extra money.", "I would have said YTA until I witnessed a situation where a smallish inheritance was split between siblings, one a millionaire and the other in a moderate amount of debt. The millionaire got the other sibling to sign over a1/5th of their inheritance to cover the costs of running the property richer sibling had bought for their parent, so rich sibling wouldn't be out of pocket while they tried to sell it. The inheritance is basically fun money for the rich sibling, although some being put in trust for kids. The poor sibling won't have much after clearing debts (including 10k owed to rich sibling) and settling divorce. \nSo I get that it's sometimes not as simple as splitting things down the middle, but how you handle it makes the difference between yta/nta.\nYou need to discuss it with them, and make sure that they are treated equally when it comes to sentimental items.\nIt's a minefield! But think you need to consider the impact on their relationship when you are gone.", "NTA But why not help emma now instead of making her dependent on your largesse? Have her move in, give her a stipend, and pay for school. 32 isn't too old and ADHD isn't an excuse today nor was it when she was a kid, I'm 10yrs older and there were plenty of resources/meds/therapy when I was in middle school for me and other classmates that were diagnosed with ADD.", "I'm leaning towards YTA\n\nRegardless of your reasoning, you think one of your children deserves more than the other. That is favoritism and will nurture resent between your daughters.\n\n>She reminded me that growing up we always spent more on Emma than her.

I'm not saying \"well *I* can do it, so what's *your* excuse!?\", I want to convey it's possible to succeed in academics with ADHD.\n\nIf all of that seems like too much work you can go with your strategy.", "If I were you I'd sit down with both kids and explain your reasonings.

I totally get were you are comming from. Emma has not chosen to have ADHD and to struggle. But I absolutely understand Sams feelings as I am in a similar position as her.

I get why they doing it and I am okay with it. But it sometimes stings regardless.", "NTA.

By Sam objecting so vehemently and bringing up their childhood it almost comes off as though she enjoys seeing Emma struggle as an adult. There\u2019s clearly some sort of vendetta she\u2019s holding onto and to not want to help your obviously struggling sibling is straight garbage. \n\nAs someone with severe ADHD the struggle is so real and it\u2019s a lonely existence because as much as people might understand they never really \u201cget it\u201d. \n\nSam needs to get over herself.", "YTA.\n\nMy parents each have their own favoured child and not-favoured child and it has damaged our entire family.

I've recently been in a sort of similar situation. My father recently made an inheritance decision that writes me and my brother out of a lot of money. There's a reason for it -- the money will go to someone who has done a lot more to \"earn\" it, and eventually to people who need it more. He talked to me about it first and explained the situation, and I totally get it and support it.

YTA!!", "Most of the value now- but unless you plan on going soonish, the car and house could very well be worth a lot less by the time this is an actual issue. The house could be worth more but you can\u2019t predict the market twenty years from now. The value that she will place on having a roof over her head though, will be much higher than the paper value of it.", "See, I believe no one is being stiffed because it's OPs money. Op could leave everything to charity if they want. If OP doesnt die, like ever, they'd probably still be spending that money trying to help their struggling daughter which OP would be free to do because it's their money.", "I disagree as the sister of a brother who struggles. My brother\u2019s quality of life will improve way more than mine if he gets more inheritance than I do. Right now I\u2019m doing well; if I get half I can get a bigger house and a better car but my life mostly remains the same. If my brother gets 80% he can finally stop renting with roommates and won\u2019t have to move every few years as well as get a car of his own. He won\u2019t have to live paycheck to paycheck either. Dividing an inheritance according to situation isn\u2019t equal, but it is equitable.

Sam has an honest job. Why doesn\u2019t OP try to help her out more while she\u2019s alive? Seems like a bit of Molly coddling here.", "Exactly. It\u2019s the principle. She\u2019s probably felt like she wasn\u2019t as loved or didn\u2019t get as much attention as Emma. This is quite literally quantifying how she favors Emma vs Sam", "Sounds like Sam needs to grow the fuck up. People with severe ADHD can struggle with even the most basic of functions which is clear from what OP says. Sam seems to think \u201cfavoritism\u201d is helping someone when they\u2019re struggling with something that came naturally for them. TBH it seems like Sam has a pretty shitty internal attitude towards Emma and probably enjoys seeing her struggle as an adult.", "From the OP:\n\n> She reminded me that growing up we always spent more on Emma than her.

Her mother doesn't even try to take any responsibility for her past and ongoing actions.", "Yeah, cause make your own living is your parents job right?", "Presumably when you need help in your old age, it will be Emma you lean in and ask for help, she will be the one who looks after you, right? I mean you wouldn\u2019t expect to tell one daughter she was barely  worth a mention in your Will, and then expect them to take on your care would you?", "Thats up to them for what they do with their lives.

What is fair? Maybe it's not fair that you have spent much more of your time, efforts, money, and now your estate on one daughter over the other. You speak fondly of Emma but not the other, who you talk about more like a niece than a daughter. \n\nYes we know ADHD is a hardship but so is an eating disorder and being the one who has to overachieve to try to win your attention.

Like others have said, either of their lives could change in an instant and the roles could be reversed. It also seems that you\u2019re essentially punishing Sam for succeeding. You love them both equally, but it\u2019s definitely understandable why Sam is upset. Not because of the money, but for the long-term favoritism. She just wants to be loved equally as much as her sister. This circumstance is tricky because \u201clove\u201d is being communicated through finances and assets. 50/50 or donate everything to charity.", "So it\u2019s not about fair.

That is not Sam\u2019s fault and if you\u2019re searching for \u201cfair\u201d then it should be split equally. Equitable means you\u2019re taking factors into consideration and splitting accordingly. \n\nI am the Sam in my family. Know why? My parents always focused so much on our Emma that I was often an afterthought. I had to learn to be resourceful and figure things out on my own because our Emma needed them more and I just needed to understand. I told both my parents that it\u2019s their money and stuff and they get to do whatever they want with it and I\u2019ll respect their wishes. I also said it felt like I continue to get punished or get less than (mainly time, attention, and effort cuz I have my own money) because I had to be mature and take care of myself and Emma gets catered too because life has always been \u201charder\u201d for her. \n\nWhen one of our parents died, the money dried up significantly. It wasn\u2019t an issue for me because as Sam, I was thoughtful and intentional in my choices and had made good decisions for myself and family. I warned everyone that Emma was gonna struggle and I wasn\u2019t going to help her. There we were not 18 months later and she\u2019s crying about how unfair it is that she isn\u2019t taken care of, blew through all the money and most significantly, had been coddled so bad by our parents that she couldn\u2019t effectively function the way she should. I get the blame and comments from family that I should something to help because as you say \u201cI\u2019m doing so much better than her.\u201d  Guess what? I earned that shit all by my damn self and it\u2019s not my job you take care of another adult in this scenario. \n\nAs I said, your money to do what you want. I think you\u2019re angry that your favoritism is on display and deep down, you know Sam is right for calling it out. It\u2019s not even about the money.

You sent a direct message with this approach; you just didn\u2019t want the message you received back. \n\nYTA.", "You sounds just awful, are you act as iff the appropriate choice for emma is to kick her to the curb for being a failure of a child.

You did right OP!", "You\u2019re penalizing your younger daughter for her relative life success in a way that is clearly hard for her to accept and presses directly on a childhood nerve.

I edited it", "It does beg the question of why tell the girls about the inheritance at all? I get the house and car for the daughter that doesn\u2019t have a stable place to live, but why discuss the money side? Good points on the underlying issues - I hadn\u2019t seen the eating disorder part yet.", "To your first statement, yes I do want that. Sam already resents Emma and OP for her childhood, but lining out very clearly what's in the will gives Emma more ammo for her grievances, whether justified or not. \n\nAs to your hypothetical, I can only answer to how I \\*think\\* I would react. And that is to accept that you can't change others, but you can change yourself. I'd hope that if I were making 500k a year that I'd stop resenting others and be happy with all that money. Again, this is a hypothetical but I'm sure willing for someone to give me 500k and let me find out.", "I am sure all three of them have a very different perception of what happened when the daughters were growing up.  Objectively, Emma does have several mental health diagnoses and it sounds like Sam was always healthy and functional. It\u2019s so much easier to point and someone with cancer or some other physical diagnosis and see how the person needed more medical care and accommodations, than it is with mental health. Ultimately though, OP is the one making the will and her understanding of the situation is that Emma\u2019s progress in life has been hindered by mental health challenges. \n\nI do kind of wonder about the sister\u2019s relationship with each other, and whether Sam has always resented Emma and perceived her as getting more attention. That would explain her feelings a bit more. And it may be a NAH situation as many kids with disabled siblings feel resentful and neglected. \n\nI have some chronic health problems due to cancer. I used to work 70-80 hours a week and now I can only work about 20-30. I have a friend who still works that busy of a schedule and every once in a while she will make a comment about how nice it would be to have more time off. (Not totally pointed but kind of just a little resentful)\n\nI always come back with, \u201cwanna switch?\u201d\n\nHer answer is always no. \n\nI kind of see Sam a bit like my friend.

Emma has ADHD. She is Neurodivergent. She has a medical condition that makes it hard for her to maintain focus. To remain motivated. If she is able to find something that she is passionate about, then she may be able to find success in her chosen field. But for a lot of people (not sure of exact figures, but I have heard anything from 20 - 40% quoted) who have ADHD, it is severe enough that they are unable to maintain a steady job.   \n\n\nOP has a very real concern about her daughter's long-term financial security, and she wants to do what she can to make it easier. Cut her some slack.", "My thoughts exactly.", "That is possible too. I hadn\u2019t considered feeling like second place. I also feel like that\u2019s hard to know for sure. Sam is so successful in everything she does I feel like she\u2019d have to have some sense of accomplishment. She\u2019s thriving but feels second place because her sister gets help that she herself doesn\u2019t require? And help in this sense is a monetary thing so part of its at least about money. It could happen, seems weird to me, but not impossible. OP should try asking what her daughter is feeling, if she\u2019ll speak to her.\n\nEdit: if we\u2019re talking about feeling like second place then Emma most certainly feels like she\u2019s second place too. She\u2019ll never be the successful person that her sister. Truly they might resent each other and/or OP when they\u2019re all feeling this notion of second place.

If it\u2019s not about money, if Sam realized she doesn\u2019t need it, then Sam shouldn\u2019t care what happens to the money if OP can change her behavior to reflect of being more supportive of Sam.\n\nI don\u2019t think one line saying Sam feels OP is playing favorites is detailing how Sam really feels. I have no idea what Sam actually said, only what\u2019s posted. If Sam didn\u2019t tell her mom she didn\u2019t care about the money and just wanted a mom that helped and supported her in other ways then that\u2019s completely different. That\u2019s just why I suggested an open and honest discussion. We only know so much on this post. If Sam made it sound like it was just about spending more money on Emma their entire lives then naturally that\u2019s all OP has to reply to as well. Or OP is omitting things. Who knows. If OP knows this is more than just about money for Sam then that needs to be addressed at a deeper level than just doing 50/50 on the will. A lifetime of childhood trauma as you put it won\u2019t be fixed by just an equal will.", "Oh for sure. As a reader I've been happy to have points clarified by an observant commenter! \ud83d\ude0a Edited for clarity lol", "I understand equity!\n\nBut Sam is voicing that she feels like Emma has had all the favourtism forever! \n\nIt\u2019s up to OP, as the parent, to fix that!", "Thanks, but I didn't invent it.", "Why do you assume emma is being enabled and not faving legitimate struggles that not everyone might face? Why are people treating her as if shes a failure that needs to be given up on and thats the best way to \"help\" somehow? That seems insane. \n\n\nAlso, its still not explained how how sam is suffering here?", "I just saw that comment, but still, what the fuck does that have to do with op.", "Exactly which is exactly what life insurance and inheritances are typically used for, to support the people you can when you\u2019re no longer there. Support which sam does not need but Emma does. If someone is living In a million dollar home and has other property\u2019s they are no where near struggling and do not need the help the sister does when taking home probably more than 10x the sister does on a yearly basis. It\u2019s greedy and entitled to be well off and doing better than most of the country and be upset your low income struggling sibling is getting more help than you.", "Equality isn\u2019t the same as equity. \n\nSam is just greedy. She\u2019s in the top percentage of owners, has wealth and shelter. \n\nSociety is designed to look after the vulnerable which\nEmma is.", "Right. Classic. You work hard and make something of yourself and somehow you\u2019re punished for that. I\u2019m successful like Sam but I\u2019m an only child so I will never be in this situation, but I can imagine that I would be pissed if I had a sibling and this was my mom. I kind of understand 60/40, maybe even 70/30 max. But 80/20 is insulting on principle, if I were Sam I would think it was a pity inheritance so it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s completely favoring Emma", "To be clear, I'm not saying that's not often the case. (I'm disabled myself, so I know how that stuff goes)\n\nThat said, it sounds like you're conscious of the imbalance and would venture to guess you're going to make sure your older son knows he is cared for as well. It sounds to me like that may not have happened here.\n\nIf I'm being brutally honest, it also seems like OP may be allowing her daughter to lean on her ADHD a bit too much. It's a real thing, but one that many of us (including myself) have had to learn to deal with. I'm not sure I would go with it as a blanket excuse for a lifetime of underachieving (and before anyone says it, I know that sounds harsh).", "She\u2019s been given financial help. And therapy. But it\u2019s been how many years? How else is she getting help? Because the rent is a Band-Aid. Not actual help. Yes she needs REAL help. Stand on her own feet. Not an allowance.", "I have a feelings it\u2019s more than that. It seems like she heard, \u201cSorry, you can\u2019t do that/I don\u2019t have time for that, Emma needs this\u201d for most of her life.", "Did you see the part where OP admits her [husband gave Sam an eating disorder](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109qmli/aita_for_giving_one_daughter_more_inheritance/j3zwejy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)?\n\nThere\u2019s more to this family dynamic than OP is being upfront about. BOTH daughters have had troubles. One managed to thrive but the other didn\u2019t. \n\nOP is punishing Sam for her success, and Sam has plenty, PLENTY to be angry about.", "What is REAL help? \n\nIt sounds like she has some pretty serious issues, maybee the type of person who, without external support of some kind, would end up homeless or in prison because they cant handle thier issues on thier own.\n\n\nIf you had a child with treatment resistant pressure headaches, you might need to support them in part thier whole life.\n\nYou act as if emma is simply lazy rather than suffering from real issues that impact her quality of life and ability to navigate the world.", "It is stated that she simply has ADHD. I\u2019m stating that it would have to be something more than that for it to debilitate her to this extent. REAL help would be figuring out what that may be, or figuring out the foundation blocks to a life where she can find her own independence. I\u2019m not assuming she\u2019s lazy. But I do think it\u2019s important that OP doesn\u2019t enable Emma or that Emma relies on her financially too much. Because at some point, Emma won\u2019t have that. This isn\u2019t a headache or a broken bone, this is something that can be managed over time. It may not look like 9-5. But there\u2019s something out there that can suit her. She\u2019s working at a stale job that would be so mentally draining, especially someone with adhd. Thats 1 thing right there that can be improved.", "OP actually says she has some other serious issues and is in therapy for them including it sounds like esteem problems (probably caused by her parents assuming she was lazy when she needed medical intervention). So, not just ADHD.", ">It is stated that she simply has ADHD\n\nThats not what OP said actually, please re read it and maybe consider your bias?"]}
