My daughter is the middle cousin (33). My daughter waited 13 years to marry her now husband. \n\nWhen they got engaged we threw them a engagement party in the back yard. I opted not to throw her a bridal shower they had been together so long at the point it seemed tacky. I talked her out of a rehearsal dinner and brunch the next morning it\u2019s just seemed tacky for two people who had been together so long and already lived together to make such a big deal. A few weeks after her wedding she expressed disappointment saying she went to all her cousins bridal shower/ rehearsal dinner happily and when it was her turn she felt like no one cared. \n\nNow she is pregnant and a topic of a baby shower came up. All her cousins had babies already so they have tons of baby stuff to giver her they don\u2019t need anymore so it seems silly to throw a big baby shower when she can get everything she needs from her cousins/ sibling. \n\nA few nights ago she expressed to me that she feels like everyone eles milestones are celebrated while hers are always pushed to the side or an afterthought. \n\nI explained to her that the first wedding in a family is always the most exciting and she waited so long that by the time she got engaged weddings were old news all her cousins were onto having babies and obviously babies are more exciting then weddings.\n\nNow that she is pregnant it feels like every other month on of the cousins is having a baby so of course it\u2019s less exciting as the first new baby but we are still happy for her. She said she was sick of attending everyone eles events only for hers to be pushed aside. I told her she sounded spoiled and I have no heard from her since. I was just trying to explain why things seemed that way.", "created_utc": 1674157843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gbb26/aita_for_explaining_to_my_daughter_why_her/", "score": 275, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's pretty normal for people to live together before they get married, and that's no reason why she shouldn't have things such as rehearsal dinner or a big white wedding or a bridal shower, if she wants those things.

My daughter is the middle cousin (33). My daughter waited 13 years to marry her now husband. \n\nWhen they got engaged we threw them a engagement party in the back yard. I opted not to throw her a bridal shower they had been together so long at the point it seemed tacky. I talked her out of a rehearsal dinner and brunch the next morning it\u2019s just seemed tacky for two people who had been together so long and already lived together to make such a big deal. A few weeks after her wedding she expressed disappointment saying she went to all her cousins bridal shower/ rehearsal dinner happily and when it was her turn she felt like no one cared. \n\nNow she is pregnant and a topic of a baby shower came up. All her cousins had babies already so they have tons of baby stuff to giver her they don\u2019t need anymore so it seems silly to throw a big baby shower when she can get everything she needs from her cousins/ sibling. \n\nA few nights ago she expressed to me that she feels like everyone eles milestones are celebrated while hers are always pushed to the side or an afterthought. \n\nI explained to her that the first wedding in a family is always the most exciting and she waited so long that by the time she got engaged weddings were old news all her cousins were onto having babies and obviously babies are more exciting then weddings.\n\nNow that she is pregnant it feels like every other month on of the cousins is having a baby so of course it\u2019s less exciting as the first new baby but we are still happy for her. She said she was sick of attending everyone eles events only for hers to be pushed aside. I told her she sounded spoiled and I have no heard from her since.
