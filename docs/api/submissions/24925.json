Me and my current boyfriend (26M) started dating 4 months ago. Me and my boyfriend do not live together. I have a two bedroom apartment, I work a fulltime job and I\u2019m in school part time. I don\u2019t ask my boyfriend for money even though he spends majority of his time at my place. I keep his dog at my place since he travels for work and he lives with his parents who do not want a puppy around that house because of the constant clean up and he\u2019s not home to do it. \n\nNow the issue. My boyfriend, my daughter and I went to my boyfriends sister\u2019s birthday dinner last night. Before we left he made a small comment about bending over in my dress. I told him we\u2019ll be sitting down for dinner. The chances I will be bending over are very low and I will be mindful. At one point, my daughter dropped her menu. I reached down to get it (bent over) under the booth and my boyfriend asked why am I bending over I told him I\u2019m getting the baby\u2019s menu it\u2019s not a big deal you\u2019re sitting right next to me no one can see and the issue was dropped. \n\nToday he texts me that he deserves more respect and he let me wear the dress because I\u2019m grown but when I brush him off and that was disrespectful. That I should just answer his question without being a smart Alec. I told him he did not let me do anything. That turned into an argument about how I don\u2019t respect him as a man and how I must still see myself as a single mom. I told him I am a single mom. That just because he spends time with me and my daughter doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s her dad or my husband. I told him respect is earned. There is a basic level of respect and then it grows as someone proves they are respectful themselves. He doesn\u2019t speak to me in a respectful tone or manner when he is upset and I work really hard to not let my emotions take over conversations. He responded that when he is disrespectful it\u2019s because he has a reason and he telling me his feelings about something I did. I told him there is a way to do that but you don\u2019t get to make statements about how me and my daughter should act in the house I pay for. He said I was being an asshole. He said I am trying to hurt his feelings. He helps with the dog when he\u2019s home and cleans the dishes and he spends time with my daughter that the way he treats me is how he would treat his wife. I told him those things are great but they don\u2019t make you her father. It\u2019s only been 4 months and there are more aspects to parenting he doesn\u2019t understand. He told me goodnight and he didn\u2019t want to talk anymore. I believe what I said was the truth but was I the asshole for saying it.\n\nEdit: I have known him for 4 years prior to dating. He traveled for months at a time before. Now it\u2019s only days at a time. We started hanging out as friends more when his schedule relaxed before we actually started dating. That\u2019s why he is around my daughter and why I was okay taking in his dog", "created_utc": 1692359898, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15uik2q/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_i_am_a_single_mother/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And just because you \u201cbrushed him off\u201d does not mean you disrespected him. It means you are an adult and can make decisions on your own and disagreed with him. Also, he does not \u201clet you\u201d do anything- you make decisions on your own. \n\nI\u2019m getting strong \u201cI am the man, you are the woman, therefore you do what I say\u201d vibes from your BF, and I think this needs to get shut down if your relationship is going to survive.

Ugh, I'd nope out of this real quick! \n\nHe \"let\" you wear a dress. Even though you set him straight that he doesn't \"let\" you do anything, that's a controlling red flag and an insight into his thought process.\n\nWhen he is being disrespectful it's for a \"reason\". In a relationship, the goal is disagree or argue respectfully. Not determine when it's time to be disrespectful. Then say RESPECT ME AS A MAN. Boy, bye. Respect is earned, not based on your gender. These insecure men kill me.\n\nMust see yourself as a \"single\". Lol, you are. You being in my life for 4 months doesn't automatically make you parent. You're a single mom with a boyfriend. \n\nI'd disengage from this quickly and say that's it's better that you be friends. He's not ready for a relationship. And who gets a dog when they travel a lot and his parents can't watch it? Plus, why in the world does he still live with his parents?? At 26. **OP, please never let him move in!!

He thinks he is entitled to speak disrespectfully to you 'when he has a reason' \n3. Despite feeling entitled to disrespect you whenever he feels like it, he feels you don't 'respect him as a man' like that's something he's owed because of his junk\n4. He thinks he is entitled to be considered your daughter's parent and your husband despite (it sounds like) not contributing all that much to what is essentially his own household or the workload of caring for your daughter\n5. He's freeloading rent and dog care off you\n\nI know Reddit loves to tell people to dump their SO at the first sign of hogging the remote but what this guy has done is show you that he's willing to freeload off you, then act like somehow you're the one who's in the wrong. Either he reads this post and has a moment of sudden clarity where he realises he's a raging entitled low-grade misogynist who needs to up his game, or you should probably consider respectfully showing him the door.", "NTA.

Your boyfriend is talking to you in a rude, authoritative way, and he truly has not earned respect, as you have stated. \n\nHowever, when someone you are in a relationship is telling you that you do not respect them as a man and you tell them they have not earned it, I cannot imagine most men in that situation. Especially at that age where he can find someone who does not have a child. Both of you need to do a better job of finding someone without a child.", "Agree - NTA!

He's the guy that if he gives her a \"suggestion\" and if she decides to do something else, he'll  scream about \"disrespect\". Ie. My suggestion was actually a command that you didn't obey.\n\nThey always say that early on in a relationship we ignore red flags until we are deep into the relationship. Then end up staying in toxicity too long. Hopefully getting these 3rd party insights will snap OP out of it!", "Right?! Sir, you purchased a dog knowing that you travel and you live with your parents who refuse to watch the dog while you travel. What was the thought process?\n\nI LOL'd at \"respect me as a man\". He sounds like a 26yo child who doesn't understand the definitions of single mom or respect.", "So for clarification\u2026he hasn\u2019t earned respect but I shouldn\u2019t have pointed it out to him?", "Let that stop! He is a walking red flag. Your responds to what he said were great. But now you should really read again what you posted that he said. And now forget him and read that as it is someone else who posted your post. What would you think about him? This is not about respecting him, this is about your autonomy! \n\nThink about your daughter, this really is very alarming behavior.", "Okay. That makes a lot more sense."]}
