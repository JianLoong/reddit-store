I work in an industry that I studied for and I am very fond of my job. I've put in a lot of hard work and have amassed countless hours of overtime, training and knowledge. My field is very male dominated so it hasn't been easy. My boss (50 M) Mike, for the most part has been an okay boss. I've had very few problems with him and he's been more than willing to help me become a well rounded employee.\n\nIn April, we hired a new employee, Greg. He has been an above average employee. He's helpful and willing to learn. I trained him myself in several aspects of our job. Everything has been going fine until recently (I should add now that Mike has had a tendency in the past to favorite male employees.) I was looking at our employee log , that's available to my whole company, and see that Greg has been promoted to a position right under me. I found this odd as I have female coworkers that have worked for us for longer and have a higher knowledge base than Greg does. This rubbed me the wrong way but I've tried to stay in my own lane about the matter. This past week, Greg and I were assigned to work on a project that required us to work consecutive day and night shifts. I assumed I'd be working days as I am the senior employee and that's how it's always worked. I then learn that Greg will be working the AM shift and I will be working the PM shift. I find this annoying 1. Because I am the senior employee and 2. I don't have a vehicle making getting to work a challenge and I rely on my GF to drop me off and pick me up. These are things my boss is very aware of. Annoyed, I spoke to my assistant manager (55 F) who told me she ask him multiple times why he was making me work the PM shift. Mike's response to her was \"Greg has kids\". We both found this perplexing as Mike has made several comments in the past about not feeling sympathetic to single mothers that work for us who need adjusted schedules to accommodate their children. I'm not going to lie, this enraged me to the point where I contacted my HR manager and filed a formal complaint. I did discuss the matter with several other female coworkers who all agree this is a huge problem with Mike.\n\nThere is part of me that feels very guilty and before I finalize the complaint form, I'm here asking AITA?\n\nTL;DR\n\nMy boss is favoring a male coworker over female employees and I reported him to HR", "created_utc": 1671027234, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zls0ie/aita_for_reporting_my_boss_to_hr/", "score": 285, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Get it nipped in the bud asap", "NTA for going to HR - if you are having issues thats what theyre there for. \n\nBut im not sure if focusing everything on this Greg is the smoking gun you think it is.", "NTA but be aware that reporting him to HR definitely is going to make a negative impact on your relationship.  Even if HR speaks with him and also promotes someone else, your manager will not forget it.  So best be looking for a new position.", "NTA\n\nI was not necessarily on board until the justification about Greg having kids and your statement that your boss has been less than accommodating to single mothers. \n\nPromotion shouldn't necessarily go by seniority, it should go by competence, diversity, and skill set. There seems to be a fair amount of evidence, however, that your boss is experiencing the kind of very common bias that leads someone to think someone who is more like them is a better candidate and deserves more opportunity based on that merit. This is particularly problematic when the shared trait that creates this affinity is gender.", "NTA, your boss is clearly showing favoritism to male employees and displaying an ugly double standard which is unprofessional. Submit your formal complaint. Best of luck!", "NTA. \n\nSeems like blatant sexism/favoritism", "I'd swear I read somewhere that it's not legal for Mike to show favor to Greg over you simply because Greg has kids. That's discrimination by familial status.\n\nRegardless, NTA. Good for you for reporting him. He deserved it.", "NTA", "NTA because your boss escalated it to a blatant level. On the surface level, he openly admitted to making a personal exception for Greg, but wouldn't for you. He has been open in the past about not finding children to be a suitable excuse. If you have qualified employees who have been there longer, there needs to be justification for promoting Greg.\n\nHowever,most are correct in saying while you're right, this is also unfortunately going to be likely to get uncomfortable for you. It shouldn't be that way, but it is. Document everything from now on, and try and keep communications over email and text. Start sending the resume elsewhere", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This may be what he needs to understand that he's breaking the law and leaving the company open to lawsuits.", "NTA", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand ... why should he favor you over the mle coworker? You want equality, not protectionism.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo with  50/50 chance, reporting you did not get the choice you wanted just makes you look entitled. No proof of discrimination there.", "NTA, however there are some points worth considering. First of all, you yourself admit that Greg is exceptional at his job, so it is hardly surprising that he is being promoted over less capable workers who have put in more time. Second, you not having a car is not more worthy of consideration than Greg having children (in fact I'd argue the opposite, you could have a car whereas Greg can't have no children), so the only thing at play regarding the alternating shifts is seniority.\n\nI do not deny that in your narrative it does sound like Mike is playing favorites, however if you're going to go to HR you had better have your ducks in a line and from were I'm sitting you've got a whole lot of nothing besides subjective feelings and hearsay. I would think long and hard if you want to blow up your career over this.", "NTA. But be careful speaking to your coworkers about your boss. Eventually someone will spill the beans to him and it could make more trouble for you. Also, even though your coworkers might agree with you, chances are very slim that they would speak up to HR. Most people are fine complaining in private about work but very few are going to rock the boat and go to HR.  I think you should ask your boss directly why you were put on the PM shift instead of day. Once you have that answer, you could include that in your complaint to HR.", "Not necessarily. It very much depends on the culture at the company.  There are a lot of workplaces that are doing intentional training to try to cut down the type of affinity based selection bias her boss is exhibiting. If that's a push this company is involved in, they may care.", "It could be that they hired Greg knowing his availability. If you tell them you can't work nights because you have kids and they still hire you they can't fire you for it. Most men aren't afraid to speak up during the hiring process that's why they usually negotiate a better deal for themselves.", "There is honestly a whole list of other male employees, none of which work for us anymore due to their poor actions, that Mike has favored and refused to accept any criticism of. Until that is, it was too late to justify their actions resulting in their termination or them leaving before it came to termination. Greg isn't a bad employee which I think is one reason I feel guilty. I just feel like it's glaringly obvious my boss is favoring him.", "I worked for a small design company years ago. I watched M/F hired at same time gradually receive very different compensation over time as the company owner was sexist. Eventually, the female talent all left, replaced by lesser talented but increasingly attractive younger women. Then the company folded. \n\nDo what you gotta do and really pay attention to the response.\n\nNTA", "This thinking right here is why situations like this continue to happen to women. We second guess ourselves, because we have learned that pointing this crap out will blow back more on us than it will on the people we report.   \nInstitutional bias seems to protect men and tell women we are being difficult for no reason", "Like I stated, my boss has made several remarks in the past about how it's people with children's problems to find child care, not his. He doesn't have kids so he blatantly has said he cannot relate to that situation, until now all the sudden. And the no car thing is very recent. As in the past 2 weeks recent.", "Where did the OP say that the women who were passed over were less capable? Also, why do you assume that the OP could have a car?", "Would you say all this to a male employee?", "If the boss makes exceptions and allowance for fathers, but refuses to for mothers, and openly talks about it he\u2019s a sexist and should be held legally and financially responsible for his flagrant sexism.", "Great comment, I totally agree.", "As the proverb goes, pray for a miracle but row away from the rocks.", "Most men don\u2019t get punished for speaking up. Women get punished for advocating and negotiating for themselves. \nWhich is not to address the complete hypocrisy of being okay with fathers needing to work around their children but having zero tolerance for mothers.", "Men get promoted based on potential. Work get promoted based on past work. This is really standard basic sexism", "If you have those receipts, id share them.", "I\u2019m getting that tattooed on my forehead", "I'm gonna use this", "NTA - report, but definitely look for another job soon", "ESH - Why do you think HR is going to punish him for a promotion they obviously approved?", "No, but i wouldnt expect anything to happen to your boss.", "NTA.  This is discrimination based on family status.", "NTA, but start job hunting.", "In theory, you did the right thing. Most companies advocate equality but sadly in reality, most HR departments exist to protect the organisation from being taken to Court over such instances. \n\nI hope you get the outcome you want but remember, your boss isn't going to forget this so you may want to consider looking for a job in a more progressive environment.", "In the 1960s this attitude about men having families to support was openly acknowledged as a legit basis for paying a man more for the exact same work. A big part of early feminism was having one's personal home situation NOT be considered at work. (That's why I have an issue with those who claim having kids means they should get priority for vacations etc.)\nNTA OP: go gettem.", "\u201cAbove average\u201d does not equal exceptional.\n\nSeniority seems to be how the company decides things, the manager ignored that. \n\nLastly, the child comment is OP referencing her boss say he has no sympathy for parents (specifically mothers), but yet your argument is trying to say he does have sympathy for parents.  Do you not pick up on context or are you trying super hard to ignore the sexism the manager clearly gives off?", "HR's job is to protect the company above everything else.\n\nWe're only getting one side of the story and have the benefit of not having any skin in the game. What we see as reasonable can totally be misinterpreted and punished by HR, especially in America where workers \"rights\" are more suggestions than actual law. Employment discrimination, especially based on gender, are hard to prove and take years to gather evidence and then to litigate.\n\nDefinitely start looking for a new job OP and you're NTA.", "OP, you need a documented pattern of favoritism and if you have records of women often getting pm shifts over am ones, bring that to the fore. I've been through this at work and I think it is a risky move to complain formally. I highly recommend you have all of this assembled in a written form with facts and figures across multiple female and male employees. This is as much about your own job security as anything else because if your HR isn't staffed by idiots, they will look at that kind of (hopefully) rock solid documentation and understand that if they find another reason to lay you off afterwards, you would have a claim of retaliation. Then again, sometimes the company just doesn't care (or are idiots) and will take the risk and retaliate anyway. And a discrimination lawsuit would likely require several female employees to seek redress (which they may be unwilling to do) and all of this can be very expensive in lawyer fees and give you a bad rep in your industry. Also, they may do nothing other than fixing how this applies to you in this one instance and then you are left with this issue not fixed at all, but you still have to report to that sexist boss. It sucks and is entirely shitty and shouldn't be the case, but you should know this going in.", "Not that you'll believe me but yes, absolutely I would.", "I hope you understand there is a difference between the manager clearly being actually sexist and OP accusing them of such?\n\nAlso above average very much does equal exceptional, maybe check a dictionary next time.", "I love this typo. We do so much of it that the entire gender gets renamed to Work!", "\u201cMike has made several comments in the past about not being sympathetic to single mothers that work for us who need adjusted schedules to accompany their children\u201d \n\nYet his excuse for Greg is \u201cGreg has kids\u201d. \n\nI guess it could just be favoritism, but can you explain the difference between the two? Due to seniority Greg should be on PM and his manager adjusted his schedule because he has kids.", "Aw shoot, can't fix it now....", "His excuse for Greg is allegedly he has kids, as told by OP's assistant manager who for whatever reasons asked Mike several times why OP must work the PM shift. Maybe OP got the last five AM shifts and it's her turn to do the PM, we don't know.", "She says her company works by seniority when it comes to these shifts.", "**Oh she said so?** Well that changes everything, put Mike in prison then.", "NTA - You know the next thing that's gonna happen if he isn't stopped is that your boss will promote Mike over you...\"because he has kids\" and needs the money more.\n\nThis is entirely HR-worthy. You need to get all your female coworkers to also file complaints.", "NTA\n\nBut yeah Mike is sexist AF. As a former employment attorney, my informal advice is to 1) start looojg for jobs and 2) contact an attorney. Even if you leave you can sue them and make life better for the other women. Greg\u2019s promotion alone over more senior and more qualified women is enough.\nAlso, if he was this open about being sexist, there is 100% chance his work emails/texts have lots of damning evidence.", "NTA people do shit like this because they get away with it. Challenge it if you want it to stop. You did well, not just for yourself but for others who might have been slighted for the same reason. Be proud", "Document everything, expect platitudes with a sting from HR and get your resume in shape.", "HR was the reason I went to the EEOC. I don\u2019t trust upward managers who are not a profit center.", "NTA, I would have done the same thing. Make sure to document everything in writing as well, along with any retaliation you get from this. Take everything to HR and make your boss put anything in writing. \n\nI'm not sure about your work culture but you may want to just take a peek at what jobs in your field are out there. \n\nI've used HR for a boss and it did get a bit messy but I was never fired. In fact, that boss was let go. Going to HR doesn't always result in you losing your job.", "NTA but hr is not going to be helpful. They based on your comment have been protecting Mike. Time to look for a new job or just grow resentful.", "I'd imagine it depends on how scared of a law suit they are.", "HR's job is not to protect the company above all else.  That is so incorrect as to what the HR profession is.  I've been in HR for 15 years.  Don't continue to minimalize other people's professions.", "agreed, this is exactly the situation HR is there to help with. \u201cProtecting the company\u201d includes protecting employees from discrimination \u2026", "I mean if you don\u2019t wanna take OP\u2019s words about how her company works at face value you can. \n\nBut IF what she said is the truth: company policy dictates this is by seniority, what is the excuse?", "She did not at any point say it was company policy though? If she had we would not be having this discussion. All she said is based on past experience she assumed she would get the better shift.", "So for 3.5 years OP experienced the seniority approach, was never told things were changing, or that a new system was being put in place. \n\nI mean if there\u2019s not sexism at play there\u2019s at least terrible management. \n\nIt just really feels like you need blatant \u201ca woman is less than a man\u201d to understand sexism."]}
