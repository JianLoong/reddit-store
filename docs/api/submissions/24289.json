My sister has two kids, and she likes to come visit and basically use my house as a hotel so she can take her kids to various theme parks in San Diego. I'm fine with that for the most part.\n\nMy problem is that my sister has very different parenting ideas than I would like in my home. She isn't big on discipline, and has gotten upset with me when I tell her kids to stop doing things. For example, I have glass doors in my house going into the laundry room, and on one visit, my nephew (then 6m, now 7m) was slamming the glass doors as hard as he could, and I was worried they would break. I admittedly freaked out a little and snapped at him not to play with the doors, and my sister got upset and told me he was fine. \n\nHer kids were better behaved when they came to visit last week, but her son has one habit that annoys me. Her son (who btw is not neurodivergent, they've taken him to multiple doctors and been told he is neurotypical) refuses to eat multiple things on the same plate. For example, say we made spaghetti, and had a side salad and bread, he would demand a plate for each thing, so three plates. He'd also demand two different forks for the spaghetti and salad, as well as a seperate plate and fork for dessert. I always buy paper and plastic dishes when they visit, and after four days they'd used up all the paper plates because of his little quirk, and so when we were having cheesecake amd he demanded another plate especially for the cake, there wasn't another paper plate for him. Personally I'm uncomfortable with the kids using real dishes, and so I said he'd just have to use one of his other plates, or not have dessert, which made my sister shoot me a dirty look, say it's fine, and go get him a real plate. She said I was the same way when I was his age (I really don't think that is true, at least to this extent).\n\nI do not feel like my sister should be the one making these rules in my home. Yes it's her kid, but I'm the one paying for the food, the dishes, and to live here. \n\nAita if I tell my sister I don't want them visiting anymore unless her children follow the rules I set for my home?", "created_utc": 1691623199, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mv2dm/aita_25f_for_telling_my_sister_29f_that_if_she/", "score": 410, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She doesn\u2019t like her nephew\u2019s very normal quirk (so normal we have plates for specific reasons like dessert plate salad plate) and doesn\u2019t want accommodate him, that\u2019s not a rule, it\u2019s some one who doesn\u2019t want her nephew over and feels put out by kids. Fine, don\u2019t host kids.", "Ma'am I said I didn't have a problem with the blanket fort, I had a problem with the parents not cleaning it up before leaving. Reading is fundamental.", "The door slamming thing wasn't an accident, it was a game. He slammed it several times before I came over to investigate.", "Just an fyi\u2026they sell \u201cSectioned\u201d plates, kind of like a School Tray. They\u2019re Plastic & keeps all foods separated. Have your Sister buy him one & bring it with her and then SHE gets to wash it. Obviously NTA & they sound a bit exhausting.", "They don't have to be on separate plates. I've always eaten salad and spaghetti on the same plate. Particularly paper plates - having a different plate for each item is wasteful as hell.", "Why are you not just buying reusable plastic plates? You  don\u2019t even have to buy kid\u2019s ones. There\u2019s plenty of nice ones and they\u2019re great for more casual meals or lunch and best of all you actually get to be a good host", "I can read just fine, thank you very much.\n\nYou are angry that a mess was left behind. A mess of blankets left in a pile. But you seem to be angry at the *children* for making this mess, instead of angry at their mother for not cleaning it up before she left. Most of your anger seems to be directed at the children instead of where it should be directed. Your ire has been raised by ordinary behaviors exhibited by children, and occurrences that should be expected when one hosts children in their home. If you don't like it, don't have them come, but don't take it out on them, because you are going to damage your relationship with them.\n\nI'm not particularly fond of children myself. But I would never be so angry about a child leaving a pile of blankets on the floor that I felt the need to blast it all over the internet. So frankly, I think there's something more going on here. Perhaps you are misplacing your irritation at your sister for using you and your home like a hotel, in which case, it would be wiser to address that issue with her. Perhaps suggest that she uses an actual hotel and just brings the kids over to visit for a while. That would be a perfectly reasonable way to approach this.\n\nI won't even touch the fact that you're being stingy with paper plates, and refusing to feed the children off of something washable and reusable like plastic plates that are not breakable. That is a whole other can of worms, and I'm surprised your sister isn't so offended that she refuses to bring them back. I feed animals off of better quality plate ware. It just screams disdain for your sister and her children. And the comment about your nephew and neurodivergence just because he doesn't like different food types on the same plate...This whole post screams disdain and distaste for them.", "You don't even know the half of it lol. All I will say is that my sister has definitely gotten a lot better at parenting her children (the oldest one in particular) in the last year. Prior to that not even his grandparents wanted him around. My mom used to have a rule that if they visited he had to be holding a parents hand the entire time, or stay outside.", "I've never thrown a fit about it but I hate when my food touches. My dad actually bought a plain white divided plate last time I visited, just to be a smartass because they like to tease me about it.", "Or plastic plate\u2019s which are reusable, washable and won\u2019t break. OP, you could even make him wash them himself.  Kids are quirky, the separate plate is thing a very minor thing to be put out about. The door was wrong but you even said he was younger and grew out of it, he\u2019ll grow out of the plate thing too. You might not be a kid person but that doesn\u2019t make the kid wrong for acting like a kid. Honestly, as the younger sister myself you seem to have \u201cI\u2019m the baby!\u201d issues and don\u2019t like to see your sister be nice and forgiving to her child. She implied you were maybe a difficult kid, maybe that\u2019s where she gained her patience. Maybe the list of your nephew\u2019s sins is more then you\u2019ve shared but based on what you\u2019ve said YTA", "Honestly the worst part of it with this trip was how they decided to leave at 7 am, and therefore didn't have time to help with any cleanup before they left. The plate and door things are what i brought up because those were the biggest cause of contention between my sister and I.", "Wait\u2026these kids eat off disposable plates ALL THE TIME??\n\nWhat a horribly wasteful behavior, yikes.", "Ma'am I never said I was angry at them about that??? Where are you getting this information? My comment literally said I would have appreciated if their parents had folded and put everything away before leaving, where does that come off as me being angry at my nephews for it? I'm pro blanket fort, hell I still make them.", "exactly.", "New Rule: she cleans up the night Before they\u2019re due to leave.", "Lies. I bet you dip your nuggets and pizza in ranch.", "I feel like the best solution for this is to eat the cake and ice cream separately, like first cake and once you're done with it get some ice cream, or other way around. Solves the soggy cake for you and there are no more dishes for the aunt/other relatives to deal with.", "It was mostly bedroom things that needed cleaning. Her kids were in one room, and they had decided to gather ALL the blankets, pillows, sheets, towels, etc. from the closet and furniture so they could \"build a big blanket fort. They only ended up using like two blankets and everything else just got thrown into a pile on the floor. And then the typical stripping the beds and putting everything in the laundry room before leaving. I don't mind the blanket fort thing (I've literally slept in blanket forts for the majority of my life), but it would've been nice if they'd had a little bit of parental supervision with that so they didn't make a mess, and then help refold everything and put it away before leaving.", "Um... I never had that issue.", "You are incorrect. I don\u2019t eat nuggets. I don\u2019t dip pizza in anything. I exclusively use ranch dressing as salad dressing.", "There is also the standard, divided sections, prison plate/old school high school plate.  They can be purchased online at Amazon, in washable laminate or disposable foil.", "Great idea! Also, casseroles or one dish meals solve this problem most of the time. My brother had this issue and I feel like we ate pasta bakes and rice dishes the majority of the time. My grandma bought him one of those school lunch trays with the divider for her house, we thought it was hilarious.", "Y'all do realize this is not the point, right?"]}
