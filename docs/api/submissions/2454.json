We also watch people get trashed for a living, so it's understood we must know our limits.\n\nNobody was forced to drink anything. We'd all worked ten hours on our feet, so it was pretty much four women seated around a coffee table loaded with whiskey, tequila, gin and mixers, and Jenny (19F) kept pouring out shots while we slowly sipped our drinks. We spoke about the rapid rate of drinking and everyone agreed they were tired and would uber home when they were good and drunk.\n\nAnd then the tears started. Jenny sobbed out of happiness, loneliness, and then just drunkeness. And then she started spam calling her ex. She'd lose her phone and then demand I find it so her ex could fetch her (spoiler: he never came). She refused to go home, even with one of us escorting, so I put her in my bed and told her to try rest. She asked me to cuddle her, so I held her for a bit and she began grinding on me, so I immediately excused myself. A while later she emerged and got back on the couch, and began the ex-calling/losing her phone in the blankets routine. And then she threw up on the couch. And when I went into my room I saw she had thrown up in my bed (it had spread and soaked for nearly an hour, yum). All of this was treated with a glassy-eyed dismissiveness that our colleagues tried to explain away by her age. Literally every blanket in my apartment came in contact with puke.\n\nWhen she was finally more sober (nearly 6 hours later, where she had napped on the only clean couch) I got her to commit to leaving. She saw the vomit and acted like it wasn't there, and I finally snapped and asked her who she thought would be cleaning up all her puke and where she thought I'd be sleeping. She sheepishly agreed to having my bed and linens cleaned, but since then she's been dragging her feet. The bed got cleaned 2 days later (she did not care that I had to stay at my partners place) and she hasn't returned the sheets she asked to dry clean herself, and gets upset when I ask for updates without greeting or acting super friendly. She excused her behaviour with alcohol, and our colleagues are saying she's just young and going through things and I'm being too harsh, but this just reeks of entitlement. I've been the drunk girl, and I've jumped through hoops to rectify my drunk mistakes, but it seems like she thinks my life will go on without a bed or ANY blankets in my home.

Nope. Old enough to drink? Must deal with the consequences.", "Nta hopefully she learned her lesson.  I too have little sympathy for sloppy drunks of any age.\n\nWhen I worked in the ER of a collage town we got drunk kids ALL the time. University policy was to send them to the ER. One morning a 19/20 was released and no one was picking up their calls.  No wallet for a taxi.  Asked how he was supposed to get back????  My answer was, we're 2 miles away.

She owes you a HUGE apology.", "Did you completely miss the part where she essentially refused to leave?", "Everyone is female. We work in a very mature setting and honestly she experiences so much belittlement over her age that it felt disrespectful to assume she couldn't handle herself. One of the reasons we became friends was because we took her seriously and didn't baby her. If she's old enough to live alone, have a job and drink, who am I to tell her when she's reached her limit?\n\nAs for ubering her, I promise I tried SO many times. She refused to order one or give her address, and when I'd push she'd hide in the bathroom spamming her ex. Eventually getting her sober was my only course of action.", "first to answer your question:\n\n>four women seated around a coffee table\n\nSecond, I agree with you 100%. Why did none of the 3 adults who are 6, 8, and 13 years older than Jenny and all work in a bar cut her off? Also, it\u2019s weird to invite someone that much younger than them to over drink, if they weren\u2019t coworkers I don\u2019t think anyone would be brushing that off as normal.", "I agree with Dizzy. Yeah she\u2019s an adult, but even adults fuck up. She should be responsible to take care of her mess ups with you, but as Dizzy said.

Also, I don't think that friends who never need to lean on you and never wanting friends who put you in that position isn't the powerful statement you think it is.", "It's not about not being available to help people, it's about life stages and the roles we play in other people's lives. My friends and I went through the same shenanigans together and learned the same lessons. If one of those people DID have a night like this in my place, I at least trust that they'd handle it correctly when sober. But when someone got trashed and belligerent in my apartment I wasn't 20 and able to laugh it off and get drunk with them, I gave up my evening and played parent, even when they were sober. \nI hope that Jenny has people who will look after her but it will not be me in the future.", "She tried humping on you, threw up on all of your blankets, was a nuisance overall, demanded you to find her phone every time she lost it, hasn't returned your sheets and...expects you to play happy house?", "Not inconsiderate, but someone should have cut her off.  As a ex bartender, not even seasoned people know when their limit is and most ppl don't drink to get drunk", "NTA. You could *kind of* argue that her behavior when drunk wasn't her fault, but she's continuing to be an AH now that she's sober.", "NTA, but the moment she started getting sloppy you should have gotten her home.

She was a mess and then extremely unapologetic about it. \n\nBut in the future I wouldn\u2019t personally freely pour drinks of hard alcohol to people I hadn\u2019t drank with much before and didn\u2019t really know and trust.

Excusing her immature behavior in over-indulging is one thing, but friends asking you to continue to excuse her immature behavior in not rectifying all the problems caused by her drunkenness, are just enablers.  She's legally an adult.  She needs to do the adult-thing and be  responsible for her actions . . . and in a timely manner.", "NTA. \n\nYou weren't inconsiderate at all. You let a drunk person stay at your place and throw up in multiple locations, and didn't ask her to leave until she had the ability to do so. \n\nSince then, you are right, she should be going out of HER way to make it up to you. Sure, she is young and had a bad drunk night, you don't want her punished, you just want to be left whole for her decisions. \n\nGo in, say HELLO HOW ARE YOU, and then tell her she either needs to return your items- cleaned- or she needs to pay you X amount by X day (maybe payday?).
