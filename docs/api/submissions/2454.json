There is no pitty for acting the fool while drunk.  In fact, you pat twice as much.   You should have tortured her when the hangover kicked in.", "NTA. You were much more patient than I would have been. I would have called her a cab or Uber and escorted her out the door the second she started turning on the tears \ud83d\ude25. I cannot stand being around drunk people, it drives me crazy. A lot of them, like this girl, run the AH meter from being maudlin (laughing, sobbing), to being sexually inappropriate to put it politely (grinding on you? \ud83d\ude26) and then puking all over the place \ud83e\udd2e without so much as an apology or offer to clean up? She sounds like a rude, disgusting, immature pig \ud83d\udc16!", "Neither of you is an asshole but both of you are foolish and impulsive.\n\nYou should have got her to **her** home, not yours. That was where you went wrong, thinking you coukd take care of an adult sized, drunken toddler. Her mistake was thinking she was adult enough to go out for drinks with the gals, who are much too old to be entertaining her anyways.", "ESH. This girl sounds like she was blackout drunk. Your collective refusal to recognize this as a problem in and of itself is concerning. I don\u2019t care what she did when she was in that state. None of that really matters. The problem is that she is getting that drunk, and in her circle, that is normalized. When I was drunk all the time and around drunk people all the time, we were always having drama and getting mad at each other for shit we did while drunk. I think this girl is going down a dangerous path and if she doesn\u2019t stop drinking, it\u2019s only going to get worse. That\u2019s the real issue, not whether or not she cleaned up her vomit.", "NTA", "NTA. Also not to be THAT person, BUT I must say, if her ex had to deal with these kinds of things on a day-to-day basis;than no wonder their an \u201cEX\u201d!!!!", "ESH Clearly this girl is in the wrong. However, you get this fixed by handing her a bucket and standing in front of her until she cleans your home. You don\u2019t encourage her to leave and trust that she will come back. You don\u2019t allow it to continue for days. You get in her face and you get aggressive about it. I feel like you are slightly TA for allowing this situation to get out of hand. We all know that scrubbing someone\u2019s bed while you feel nauseous and hungover the next morning\u2026 is the best way to learn never to be in that predicament again.", "NTA. I would also recommend reporting her to your place of work over this, *especially* because of this bit:\n\n>She asked me to cuddle her, so I held her for a bit and she began grinding on me, so I immediately excused myself. \n\nThat right there is textbook sexual harassment, and from other similar scenarios I've seen people talk about on here, you're lucky she's not vindictive for denying her advances and reported *you*.", "You can buy disposable puke bags on amazon that should probably fit in your pocket! https://www.amazon.co.uk/JFA-Medical-Disposable-Sick-Vomit/dp/B083M61TZF this kind of thing?

I always have a plastic carrier bag folded up in my backpack with a couple of ziplock bags and some paper towels in. Makes me a lot less anxious to travel.", "Fair.", "Please point out where I ever said OP has to tolerate this behaviour or that any of the 19 year olds behaviour was excusable \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Please I\u2019m waiting! All I\u2019m saying is that a 19 year old behaving badly is not some big surprise especially to folks OPs age. It\u2019s why people who don\u2019t want to deal with typical 19 year old nonsense don\u2019t hang out with and especially don\u2019t party with 19 year olds. OP should have kicked her out the minute she started getting out of control instead of expecting a drunk 19 year old to show the maturity of someone much older and wiser. OP is the experienced adult here and did not have to tolerate any bad behaviour and should have been wise enough to draw that line earlier because experience and insight are gifts held by more established adults not teenagers who have only been an adult for 1 year. Stop trying to use words like victim blaming in the context of a drunk teenager throwing up all over the place, it minimizes the meaning of the word used by real people.", "My reddit comments gift find was r/misophonia hehe  :thumbsup:", "NTA - alcohol is not an excuse to be and ass and not take responsibility for your drunken actions. Been drunk many times, never done this clownery as a teen.", "ESH. Since you are the host, you could have and should have cut her off long before she got to that point. You are also a grown woman and she\u2019s still practically a kid. What were you thinking, letting her get that drunk?!? What if she had gotten alcohol poisoning? She could have died. \n\nBut she should have cleaned up her own disgusting mess. But once again, you should not have let her get that drunk, as the host, and as a responsible, mature adult. What did you THINK was going to happen when she got that plastered?!?", "Definitely NTA! I would have made her clean it up while she was still feeling the effects of drinking like that", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nbeing wasted and stupid at 19? no biggie...we've all been there.\n\nbut not apologizing and cleaning up your mess? that's a dick move.", "NTA. She is a legal adult. Fuck her problems. She needs to learn how to control herself. Take her to small claims court if you have that as an option.", "NTA. I was that person once and people \"let it slide\" because I was young and going through stuff. Eventually when I was old enough that people wouldn't cut me slack anymore, that was what helped me stop being that person. Honestly wish people had called me out earlier.", "NTA Honestly, from what you wrote here, you weren't rude with her at any point. You just asked her to clean up her own mess. Does she have any memory of her drunk behavior? Were you two alone the whole time this was happening? I can't imagine anyone would be on her side if they witnessed what you've just described. But I'd get the estimate from the cleaners and send her the bill. I'd also threaten to take her to the small claims court (kind of an overkill tbh)or at least tell everyone who has ears what she did. She's 19 and she's legally an adult. If she keeps acting like this she's going to end up in a much bigger mess. Chances are, she's used to getting away from the consequences of her actions because, from what you're describing, she's not taking a damn step to rectify anything she did. Except for mopping around like a typical teenager, which isn't going to get your apartment cleaned.", "If it can be explained away by age then maybe you should be calling and speaking with her mother about her fucking antics. Homegirl owes you the vomit cleaned from your home and a pile of bedding back. What a fucking disgrace. It goes without saying she can never be let back into your home. And if she pulls this nonsense again at one of your coworkers houses they are absolutely on their own. They are the worst of \u201cfriends.\u201d", "NTA, and ask your coworkers if they want to host next time. After all, she\u2019s just young and going through some stuff.", "NTA, honestly the thing I most horrified about here is that she made physical contact with you in an unwanted manner. Like all of this is horrible and she's being inconsiderate and immature, you're not wrong to be upset about any of it", "NTA. I\u2019m sure most of us have had our time of drinking too much and making a fool of ourselves but for sure if I\u2019d been sick all over someone else\u2019s house I would be doing everything I could to clean up after myself and apologise to the poor host for my terrible behaviour", "NTA: Part of the learning process of using, rather than abusing, intoxicants as an adult is that if you enagage in bad behavior while drunk, you help mitigate the consequences. You apologize, you clean your mess, or you pay for anything you damaged. You don't get to use \"i'm too young and drank too much\" as an excuse. That's what happened - it is not the _excuse_ for what happened.\n\n\"I only crashed the car into your house because I was wearing my blindfold and never learned to drive!\"\n\nIf you just accepted your stuff being ruined, that would not only imply a lack of respect for self, but would teach her that ruining other people's stuff and dumping your mess on them is okay, and all you have to do to make it okay is to get trashed.", "yeah I\u2019m not completely over that ?? like she fully GRINDED on OP and no ones talking about it? \ud83d\ude2d", "Draping an arm over a friend who is sobbing isn't cheating.

We spoke about the rapid rate of drinking\"\n\n When speaking about the rapid rate of drinking has no effect, you gather up the bottles and call it a night. And you do this BEFORE someone gets calling the ex/puking drunk. Given her age she's less likely to know her limit, or know enough to care. As the older ones with more experience, the rest of you should have reined her in. It's a kindness.\n\nOf course no one should get so drunk they hurl all over someone's home, but it was your home that got sullied and you sat there and let it happen. Either you're a bad judge of someone getting trashed or you knew and chose to do nothing. You can't have it both ways. Yep, she should make it right, but you should have known better. \\*gee, officer, I TOLD my toddler not to play with the (dangerous thing) lying there on the table. I can't imagine how the neighbor ended up in the ER\\* smh\n\n \"and everyone agreed they were tired and would uber home when they were good and drunk.\"\n\nAnd here's a novel thought: how about uber home before that point so they don't inflict a 'good and drunk' person on the poor driver.", "The people who excuse their behavior due to drunkenness are the people who intentionally get drunk because they don\u2019t care about the outcome.\nNTA but don\u2019t expect those sheets back.", "NTA also gross", "NTA. \n\nBut you\u2019re also dumb. \n\nDrunk girl never ever goes into your bed.
