It was that way while my mom was alive, when my dad was widowered with three kids and after he remarried when I was 8. My paternal grandparents always invited my maternal grandparents and for a while it was with mom and then Jane (stepmom) was included. This year was all kinds of weird because Jane showed up to my grandparents house acting like a kid at Christmas which is unusual for her, because she's normally unhappy her parents and siblings are not included, and she was like that for a good couple of hours. My brothers (22m and 18m) and I (20f) gave our maternal grandma this really sentimental gift that also included our mom who was her only child. She'd written some letter for her when she had just become a mom and we framed a copy of that and added our own letters to her, with photos of us surrounding it. She cried. My paternal grandma cried. My grandpa's cried.\n\nI noticed Jane looked unhappy once she saw what grandma got and when all the gifts were given out she started crying at the table. My grandpa (paternal) asked her what was wrong and she said she thought the gift for grandma was for her and was adoption papers where all three of us would ask her to adopt us. Things got very quiet. My grandma (paternal) asked her what made her believe that would happen and Jane replied that we are all grown adults now, out of the house, and that you see on videos all the time that it's normally when kids show their love and appreciation and allow that final step to be completed. She told us she had watched some old videos from past years and thought she might get it this year. She told the room she figured everyone was waiting for that. My maternal grandparents said they had never waited for or expected that. She got more upset and left the table and went outside.\n\nMy brothers and I followed her out and we told her we were sorry she was upset but we made it clear to her we were never going to ask her to adopt us. That we do not consider her our mother, our mom, our second or bonus mom or anything like that. My younger brother told her there was a reason we never slipped and called her mom in the 12 years we have known her. She asked if we were totally closed off from the idea. All three of us said yes. I told her I only ever had one mom and she's gone but she's still my mom and I would never erase that from my identity legally even if that legality does nothing for me, it's sentimentally important.\n\nShe then asked us why we were telling her on Mother's Day. She said we could have just left her to cry it out since we didn't care and it would have been less cruel than delivering that blow on a day like that. Dad was not happy when Jane told him what we said about the adoption. He said there were better times than that to deliver that news.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684394888, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13krmjq/aita_for_explaining_to_my_stepmom_we_wont_ever/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We\u2019re you supposed to say \u201cummm can we answer that another day\u201d\n\nAnd how did she know about the gift? Was she snooping? Or had you shown her? Because if she was snooping, then don\u2019t snoop! If you had shown her, then it\u2019s not for her. You don\u2019t show people if the gift is for them.", "NTA Your stepmother was the one who chose to make the day all about her when she didn't get what she wanted and then decided to throw her pity party in front of both sets of your grandparents and needs to accept that your never going to allow her to adopt you, and she shouldn't have brought it up on Mother's Day if she didn't want to and wasn't willing to hear the truth that you will never see her as a mother type figure.", "NTA she brought up the expectation of adoption on Mother\u2019s Day and an issue like that is important to set straight sooner rather than later. She upset herself by expecting something of a TikTok probably", "NTA - you didn\u2019t deliver it out of now where, she burst into tears at the table and it happened to be on Mother\u2019s Day, it would\u2019ve been bizaree to wait till past midnight to confront her with the truth. The truth was going to hurt no matter which day you chose, they need to realise you are you own people who made your decision from when you were children. It\u2019s sad but she needs to face it and your dad needs to stop enabling it further.", "NTA. She's the one who brought out the topic during mother's day, and she's the one who made a scene over it, i understand she's upset because her illusion was crushed but in the end you limited yourself to clarifying what was an uncomfortable situation for everyone and which she herself had created", "Nta, if she didn't want it explained to her on mother's day, she shouldn't have made it a big deal on mother's day. It's unfortunate that she was wrong about what the papers were, but it's not your fault she made that assumption. It sounds like you aren't even that close and she just thought she'd automatically get the mom title just because she married your dad. Doesn't work that way.", ">She then asked us why we were telling her on Mother's Day.\n\n'How *dare* you hurt my feelings over a problem that is entirely my own making'. Classic.\n\nShe decided to create drama on Mother's Day and get upset over something all three of you have made clear to her will *never* happen. Like, was she seriously expecting you to suddenly, after 12 years of addressing her by her first name, produce adoption papers and start calling her 'mum'? Also, at what other point would it have been appropriate to answer her question about your feelings on adoption? She chose to ask you on Mother's Day and I imagine if you had told her to wait for another time for your answer she would've drawn her own conclusions and become upset anyway. You simply cannot win with people like her.\n\nThe hurt she is experiencing right now is entirely self-inflicted. She hyped herself up over internet videos of other people asking their step-parents to adopt them and truly believed she was owed it herself. That shows a level of entitlement, self-importance and complete disconnect from reality that I would personally want to distance myself from.\n\nNTA", "Oy vey. \n\nThere needs to be a day for the people who parent but do not fit into mothers\u2019 or fathers\u2019 day. And we need to learn how to acknowledge, value, and be present with those relationships as an entire culture instead of perpetuating fairytales. Find a way to acknowledge the person who shows up and marries into a family with a pack of feral kids without the idea that you are only really accepted when the kids call you mom. That is some Hallmark channel bs that rarely plays out. And I think it causes more harm than good. \n\nYou are NTA. I feel for Jane. It sounds like she is experiencing a lot of pain. But as kids you were not the ones selling her the fantasy. I hope she finds some peace around this.", "NTA.  Why would Jane expect to adopt three legal adults?  Also, you didn't bring it up; she did.  She made herself unhappy with her unrealistic expectations.", "NTA\nJane was the one who brought it up on Mother's Day. Also, she is kind of foolish for assuming the only thing you and your siblings could possibly be planning for Mother's Day was an adoption.", "I mean, you went a little harder than you needed to, but still NTA.\n\nThats a weird thing to just assume is going to happen. Especially considering the circumstance. You could have been a little nicer about it but hard truths dont always come out that way.", "INFO: \n\nIs this the first time that this conversation ever surfaced? \n\nBecause my verdict would greatly depend on how you all understood your family in essence prior to this incident. \n\"Since you were 8\", is a long enough time for some step mothers to become mother figures. Depending on how her role in the family was handled prior to this, I can either very much understand her hurt, or find it imposing.", "NTA it\u2019s quite awkward that she would make a scene of herself like that in front of everyone, basically asking for sympathy from people for not getting what she wanted. \nThat being said, I don\u2019t know your family dynamics so I may be way off base here\u2026but even if she was not biologically you Mother, if she performed motherly duties like bringing you to activities, cooking for you, supporting you in any way, I don\u2019t think it would hurt to acknowledge her for Mother\u2019s Day in some way.", "ESH. While Jane's assumptions about the gift and adoption were misguided, and it's completely understandable that you and your siblings feel strongly about maintaining your connection to your late mother, the timing of the conversation could have been handled better.  \n\n\nIt's clear that emotions were running high on Mother's Day, but discussing such a sensitive topic on that day may not have been the best approach. It's important to have honest conversations about your feelings, but choosing a less emotionally-charged time might have been more appropriate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA. Enjoy your life", "She saw the stack of gifts we had brought with us. She just assumed from there that the flatter one was hers and what was in it. We never showed her, she didn't actually see inside it either to know exactly what was in it. Her mind just ran with what she expected.", "That was an argument my brother made. SHE brought it up on Mother's Day. He also said she was the one who brought it up in front of parents who lost their only child and implied they had wanted or expected us to want to be adopted by someone else and that it was far more cruel than anything else.", "It happens sometimes. You see videos online where adults ask their long time stepparents (or foster parents sometimes) to legally adopt them.", "It's the first time it surfaced like this. I remember some kind of conversation a few days before their wedding where dad asked how we would feel about Jane adopting us. None of us wanted her to and I can't remember if it was me or my older brother who said we already had a mom. That was pretty much it for that conversation until Sunday when it came up again.", "She gets acknowledged but not as our mom, which I think is part of the problem. We always made sure any Mother's Day cards for her were addressed for a stepmother and not a mom.", "Kinda weird thing to go to when you \u201ckids\u201d are all adults and never slipped up calling her Mum.", "100% OP, the casual and thoughtless cruelty on stepmom's side far outweighs the serious and thoughtful rejection your siblings handed her in response. Honestly, you all handled it far better than most would.", "Are you the youngest? Was she very involved in your life?\n\nMy line of thinking at the moment is that this is genuine hurt, because if she was with you since you were 8, she must have done \"mom\"- work for you, and filled some kind of parent role for you. Unless she was downright detached and horrible. \n\nYou are definitely no AH for how you feel about your mom being irreplacable. \n\nBut I'm hesitant to call her one either yet, because I could see how you could be hurt by that rejection, as a step \"mom\", if things like this weren't talked about, and if you had been very involved with \"your\" kids. \n\nOne conversation at the beginning of a marriage about this is also not great communication. She might have assumed that was for then, and almost a decade later things might look different for her.", "I think that\u2019s fair. Maybe when the situation has cooled have a compassionate conversation about her role in your life, if she is feeling unappreciated because you won\u2019t give her the title let her know that\u2019s not why. Your biological mother will always hold that space in your heart and you\u2019re not looking to replace her.", "No, I'm the middle. My younger brother was 6 when she married dad, I was 8 and my older brother was 10. \n\nI definitely think how my brothers and I looked at her role was different than how she looked at it. She saw herself being a mother and stepping into the role of a mother. We saw her as an adult figure who was doing parent stuff as a stepmother but not necessarily as a mom or true mother figure. I see both my grandma's more in that role, my older brother too, while my younger brother feels that a little more strongly toward our maternal grandma and I think that could have started a few months after mom died and maternal grandma stayed with him while he was getting his tonsils removed because dad was denied time off work to be there with him, so grandma stepped in.", "Another comment talked about how her behaviour was also insensitive toward your maternal grandparents, and I agree. \n\nSo on the whole, NTA for you and slight AH for her, for making it a big deal in front of your mother's parents. But unless she has a history of imposing herself, and forcing herself into that mom role (which I think you would have mentioned by now) I'm gonna lay most of the blame on how this was handled the years prior. \n\nMaybe she would have needed more validation as a parenting step mom, maybe you all should have talked about these things in clearer terms, you'll have to judge the specifics of that. \nIt sounds like this was years in the making. It just boiled over now."]}
