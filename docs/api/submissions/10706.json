How's the silent treatment affecting you anyway?", "NTA, I actually feel bad for Trent though, sounds like his mum is one of those enablers that will cause him to have issues in the future when he still pees on the floor or isn\u2019t responsible for any messes he makes.", "NTA\n\nMy sister doesn't enforce cleaning up after yourself or lifting the seat if you're going to stand to pee with my nephew and their bathrooms are always disgusting because he basically pees everywhere. If I'm babysitting, one of the first things I do is have him clean the toilet so that it's not covered in urine.\n\nIn my opinion, _you_ having these two boys clean up their mess is going to go a lot further in making an impact and potentially changing their behavior just _because_ you \"shouldn't\" have made them do it.", "Lol! Nta that mum is weird", "NTA\n\nBiggest AH is Trent's mom.", "NTA, your house you're rules. Also it makes sense and you didn't shame them you simply told them to clean up a mess. What if they played with toys and made a mess? Would asking them to put everything back also be considered bad? She should have told her son if you are a guest in someone's home you do as told", "She is definitely one of those moms that doesn\u2019t think her kid does anything wrong and is raising an entitled brat. You are NTA. Be grateful she\u2019s ignoring you.", "If you don't care, why are you asking?", "They made a mess at your house, and you made them clean it up. N TA for this.\n\nBut the shaming of the mother was a real AH move.   I'm sure your 8 year old isn't perfect either, and how would you feel if other parents would shame you for your parenting every time he behaves not perfect at a friends house? \n\nAlso, the mother calling because you made them \"clean your bathroom\" clearly tells you, her son told her not the whole story and her outrage was based on false information. Reacting with an explanation instead of an insult would be the adult thing to do.\n\nEdit: YTA", "Why in the world did you let two young boys go to the bathroom together in your home?\n\nMaking them clean the toilet was fine, NTA. But Trent\u2019s mom is mad about the wrong thing.", "NTA for, well... clean the whole toilet for hitting the seat? The seat definitely. YATA for your response to his mother. \"At least you taught him one thing\"? That's a bit much.", "YTA imo because you went about it in an asshole way. You could have pulled the child aside and show them the mess and ask them to clean up after themselves and be mindful in the future instead of handing them lysol and a toilet brush?? And to tell the other mom \"at least you taught him one thing right.\" What the fuck? \n\nAlso, I think you actually do care because you wouldn't be posting this. I wouldn't want to talk to you either after that comment. Totally rude and unnecessary. They are children.", "....I'm sorry, you made an eight year old scrub the toilet because they missed? I'm pretty sure I missed when I was eight, and I don't even have the messy style of plumbing.", "NTA for making them clean their mess but you should have been keeping a closer eye on them. YTA big time for insulting his mother and being so callous about it. YTA overall", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Admittedly, I have no sons, but when my daughter was little her best friend was a boy the same age.  I know for a fact his mom would have cheered you on and given him additional toilet cleaning duties at home.  We can love our kids beyond reason and still teach them civilized behavior.", "[deleted]", "ESH. The kids needed to learn, so fine. The mother obviously is one of those who always wants to fight with other parents and likely teachers, which is common, but that makes her an AH. You were an AH for the way you handled it in discussing it with her.", "No but it's funny that she thinks that I should care like I'm her husband or some.", "Men who behave like that remind me of untrained dogs honestly", "Apparently my comment hurt her feelings more than it irritated me that her son didn't lift the seat", "Why not?\n\nThey go together at school.

My point is that us how i knew it was the two if them. And the school bathrooms are always a mess whether they share or don't share a urinal.", "NTA, if you piss on a toilet seat, you clean it up.

That kid must have been confused.", "NTA I wanna do this with adults who come to my house.", "INFO: why the fuck are these two boys peeing together?\n\n(istg, don't say that's how it works in school or public restrooms: you do not pee together in the same stall or urinal at a school or public restroom)", "NTA\nAt least she taught him on right hing and he washed his hands...
