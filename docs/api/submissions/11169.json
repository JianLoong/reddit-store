I\u2019ve had dogs all my life but recently my niece(whom I babysit) has developed an allergy to dogs. Because of this I decided not to get another one after my dog Luna passed away until my niece gets to grade school in a few years.\n\nA while ago a dog named Stevie was brought in. He was found near the highway and probably been abandoned. He had some old scars and was very skittish. He is probably pitbull mix but there is no genetic testing so we aren\u2019t sure. He is very nervous all the time and doesn\u2019t react well with other dogs so we keep him separately. Only me and a few other staff can touch him. I\u2019ve had reactive dogs and in my opinion he can really only go to a home with no kids, cats or other dogs. But those are rare and most people who adopt already have another pet and/or kids. \n\nStevie has been in the shelter for 7 months and we are worried he might be put on this list to be put down soon. We listed his reaction to children as unknown but personally I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with him with my niece or other children. \n\nA family came in and asked about him and one of the staff that can touch him and that he seems to like talked to them and told him he was good with kids. I was pretty shocked because of his behavior but he wasn\u2019t put as not recommended for children. The family saw a few dogs and was debating between Stevie and another dog who is much more comfortable around humans. Stevie is only 3 years old so probably that\u2019s why they wanted him as he is a young adult that\u2019s not too large. \n\nI was leaving and spotted them talking about the adoption outside and they spotting me because I was one of the people they talked to and the kid waved. I went over and they said they were still thinking between Stevie and the other dog. I couldn\u2019t hold my mouth any longer and admitted Stevie is reactive and unknown with children but is definitely dog reactive and in my opinion shouldn\u2019t go to a home with kids. The parents were shocked and asked me why the staff told them Stevie was ok with kids. I said I didn\u2019t know but internally I know it\u2019s because he might be put down if he wasn\u2019t adopted because we are overcapacity from abandoned pets during the pandemic. \n\nI left but a staffer saw me and confronted me a week later because the family left without adopting a dog when they seemed pretty adamant before they wanted one. I admitted it was probably because I told them Stevie isn\u2019t a good fit with kids but they are mad because I\u2019m not a trainer but neither are they. This is a small private rescue and they didn\u2019t have a trainer evaluate him. They are mad at me because Stevie lost his possibly only chance to get adopted but I\u2019m adamant he shouldn\u2019t go to a home with children. Some of the staff want me gone because I overreached when I\u2019m just a volunteer and some agree that Stevie can\u2019t go to a family with kids.

Yes. But would it be worse if Stevie mauled a child and *then* got put down? Absolutely.\n\nThe adopters need to be able to make an informed decision. Being told he\u2019s \u201cgood with kids\u201d is misleading and dangerous, because his reaction is unknown. He should go to a home without kids or other pets, and preferably with someone knowledgeable in dealing with reactive dogs.", "This scenario actually happened where I live, 2 years ago. A shelter adopted a dog out and told the new owners it was ok with kids and other dogs. Knowing tthat the family had a dog, and 2 kids between 7-10. Not even 24 hrs after they brought the dog home, it attacked their oldest child ( needed over 100 stitches to their face ) then attacked and killed their dog. And no, the dog wasn\u2019t left alone with the kid or other dog. Parents were in the room. It just happened that fast. The adopters did some research, and found it had a history of attacking animals and humans, and was moved to a different area so it would be put down. Also, the animal rescue was aware of this. They were told not to adopt out to anyone with children or other animals. And the rescue only had the dog in their possession for 48 hrs before adopting it to this family. Not long enough to be able to judge what family it would suit best. More research showed this rescue had a long history of doing things like this. OP, you did the right thing. It may not have been your job to tell the family that the dog wasn\u2019t good with children. But it was the right thing to do. If something had happened, and you knew you could have stopped it, you would never forgive yourself.", "NTA\n\nThe last thing this rescue wants is a lawsuit.\n\nIf Stevie bit the child, they would and can sue the shelter for neglectful behavior and purposeful child endangerment.\n\nThis is why most large scale shelters have proper behavioral screening or take no chance and disclose everything to avoid being held accountable.\n\nYou did them a favor.", "NTA\nStevie MIGHT get put down if he stays. He will DEFINITELY be put down if he bites a kid", "oh my god, NTA and you need to report that staff member to someone higher up. it is insanely fucking dangerous that they would blatantly lie about such an important safety issue. you say it\u2019s unknown how he reacts to children, so definitively telling them that he is good with kids is a bald-faced lie. children are attacked by, mauled, and even killed by dogs more often than most people realize, sometimes without any previous warning signs. i\u2019m not trying to demonize dogs btw i have 3, but children are unpredictable and can trigger a reaction from even the most harmless looking dog. you are a good person for warning them, please don\u2019t let that scummy staff member make you feel differently.", "NTA - I volunteered at a shelter and you did the right thing. The shelter should be doing due diligence to make sure he goes to a home that's prepared so that no one is injured.", "NTA I'm a volunteer at a dog rescue too, aside from the dog coordinator who manages everything it's all volunteer run so I can't really say anything about you \"just being a volunteer\". We also deal with difficult dogs sometimes, and it's important that people know what they are getting into when they adopt a dog, the person who told them he was good with kids shouldn't have lied and should have said they don't know. Ultimately I do think you did the right thing. If they had adopted Stevie and he wasn't good with the kid he likely would have been returned anyway (not to mention how someone could have gotten hurt!) That back and forth into an unfamiliar environment with strangers after a tentative feeling of safety at the shelter would be stressful for Stevie and would have been unnecessary stress when he was returned, which could make his reaction to being rehomed again even more stressful.\n\nIf you guys are worried about Stevie being put down, try and reach out to no kill shelters and rescues that work with problem dogs, they may be able to take him in. We get a fair amount of dogs from shelters at my rescue.", "NTA, the family left without adopting because they were upset about being lied to, and couldn't trust the shelter. If they're willing to lie to people about one dog, who's to say they're not lying about the others. I'd have left too. You did the right thing, NTA at all.", "NTA \n\nIf Stevie is reactive and is unknown with kids then who is going to volunteer their little kids to be the one he is tested on?\n\nMaybe that person saying he is fine can bring in their little kids. \n\nLittle kids move too fast and are too unpredictable for reactive dogs", "NTA. \n\nIn my experience, if the dog is reactive to other animals, and can barely be handled by adults, there's a huge chance he could hurt a child. You did the right thing by being honest. That family probably walked away because the staff was more than willing to put a potential danger in their home, just for the sake that he won't be euthanized. What Stevie needs is a foster home and lots of handling.", "This is a known issue with animal shelters, which seem to be above reproach for some reason.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you might have saved that family from having to go through one of the worse experience in their life. At the end of the day a human life is more valuable than that of a dog, and if I had to pull the trigger to save the life of a child vs anything else, it will always be anything else as I don't believe that anyone who is incapable of being able to fend for themselves should bear the blunt of other peoples decisions.", "Stevie would be brought right back. The couple didn't adopt that day because they were lied to and now didn't trust the rescue. NTA.", "NTA\n\nOp you are my hero.   \n\n\nI have the most horrific pictures of my friends hand that was savaged by her rescue dog that was allegedly \u2018fine\u2019. This was a woman who has been a dog owner for many many years and who always takes rescue dogs.   \n\n\nThe dog was, despite the rescue centres protestations he was just a little skittish,  incredibly reactive and would not settle even with extensive work. Turning for no apparent reason and Biting her three times over the course of three months - with the final savage attack narrowly missing causing permanent loss of hand function.  \n\nwith regret they returned the dog to the centre on the promise it would be a no kill, permanent situation and not be sent out for rehoming again -  a few months later we see the same dog advertised as up for adoption - when challenged the centre even denied the dog had ever had a problem or bitten anyone. We showed them the  photos (very distinctive dog) and reminded them of the case and they changed it from general adoption to a no kids, no pets provision. I mean seriously - if her hand had been a kid\u2019s face or neck the child would have died - no doubt about it.", "NTA. If Stevie would\u2019ve gone home with that family and attacked that kid, the situation could be monumentally worse for everyone involved (you, Stevie, the family, and the shelter). When safety is involved, you don\u2019t compromise honesty.", "NTA, this will be the best for the dog also, they will require extreme care to rehab if that's the way their acting. If the dog has a chance of being put down I would see about maybe finding a no kill shelter that might be willing to take them in. Depending on the area some specialize in pitbulls since they are a hard breed to get adopted due to stigma. But remember that it might cost you your position there.", "NTA. You did a good thing. I know Stevie\u2019s in a bad situation at the moment but what your colleague did is simply unacceptable. They were  willing to lie to a family with young children about whether or not Stevie would be a safe addition to their home. If Stevie had bitten one of the kids, where would he be? Right back at your shelter with a bite history history attached and effectively rendered unadoptable, or worse, put down immediately. I know your colleague likely had good intentions but the outcome could\u2019ve been disastrous for everyone involved. Frankly, it sounds like the staff need to be retrained ASAP because this is unethical. I\u2019m genuinely concerned that so many of them think that this approach is OK.", "NTA. I work with dogs at a training facility, and I wouldn\u2019t trust a dog like that around kids for several reasons even without directly biting a child yet. If he\u2019s so nervous that you guys can\u2019t touch him, I doubt he will take well to a child pushing his buttons and not being able to see when he\u2019s stressed. There\u2019s a chance he would warm up and be fine, but if the day comes that the kid gets bit in the face and the dog might get put down anyway. At least inform people of the risks and commitment. Some people can handle owning a reactive dog and some people can\u2019t. It\u2019s a lifestyle change that most people aren\u2019t willing to do. When I adopted my dog from a rescue, they lied and they told me he was friendly with strangers and kids, then the second day we had him he bit a child at a pet store. I kept him because we don\u2019t have any kids and I figured if I didn\u2019t keep him, he\u2019d end up being rehomed a lot and probably put down. I know they knew his history, and luckily I\u2019m in touch with his litters owners so I know his whole history too.", "NTA.  You're a volunteer, what are they going to do? Dock your pay? Fire you? You did the shelter a favor by preventing a potential liability.  You did the family a favor by helping them make an informed decision. And I know it doesn't seem that way, but you did Stevie a favor, too.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a horribly sad situation, and the only person to blame here was whoever hurt and abandoned Stevie. You absolutely did the right thing, and I hope that an appropriate family steps up to save this poor pup.", "You were asked your opinion. You gave it.\n\nNTA", "NTA a dog that has an unknown reactivity to children should not be adopted by a family who has kids.", "You're NTA OP, in fact, I think you did the right thing. Because if they aren't sure how the dog might react to kids they shouldn't recommend for the family with a kid to adopt it. Who knows what might have happened if the dog got stressed out or smth and harmed the kid or itself?", "NTA\n\nIgnore everyone saying you don't know for sure it's a pitbull and those saying you don't know for sure it's dangerous to children.\n\nI volunteered at a shelter for a few years working with dogs. We cared for their needs and worked on socialization issues.  I can almost always spot a pit or pit mix. The jaws of a pit are unmistakable.\n\nSo many dog \"advocates\" don't seem to know what dogs are. All our known breeds were developed by humans to make certain behaviors automatic. Push the right button, and they'll execute the desired behavior.\n\nI had a water retriever that had never been to a body of water. When she was about a year, I took her to a lake with a tennis ball. She was completely ball obsessed and would chase that ball until she was exhausted. She wasn't trained to do this.  She had no choice.\n\nI've seen herder breeds with no training or exposure to farm animals. When they moved to a farm, the dog herded everything. Another herder, untrained, who herded everybody in the house. If we were gathered in the living room or kitchen and one of us went to the bathroom, the dog would chase us to the bathroom, wait outside the door, and herd us back to the group.  These dogs didn't intellectually evaluate the situation, count how many aspects of the situation ticked his herding tendencies, and then decide to act. The dog has no choice.  Not all herder or retriever dogs will express their breeding in the same way, but they will express it.\n\nPitbulls were developed to kill. Not to fight, to kill. This does not make them evil. This does not mean they can't be good companions. It does mean that dogs of that breed need special attention and understanding. And just as some breeds are more likely to roam or run, this breed is more likely to kill.\n\nWhile there are general actions that can stimulate aggressive responses, we can not predict an individual dogs every trigger.  An untrained dog can be more dangerous because their genetic tendencies have never been studied and understood. You can't train a dog to manage triggers if you don't know what those triggers are. \n\nWhile it's sad to have to put down a dog, it's better than having to put down the dog and bury a child.", "NTA because I always hear about reactive dogs getting pushed out to get adopted through dishonesty on the part of the shelter. That family was told he was good with kids- a lie, because it is unknown whether or not he is. Reactive dogs are really hard to find homes for but what is the best situation here? Is it the situation where he waits in the shelter for the right home (and is given the mercy of behavioral euthanasia if he can not find the right home), or the situation where he is adopted into a situation that may lead to a bite, which would lead to BE anyways?\n\nBehavioral euthanasia is demonized so much by those who haven't worked with reactive or aggressive dogs. As a reactive dog owner heavily involved in rescue, who has met other reactive dog owners whose only choice was BE, this type of dishonesty in adopting dogs out is often what results in BE in the first place. \n\nI think what a lot of people saying that you're the asshole here are missing is experience with rescue work and reactive dogs in general. Sometimes it just sucks and you can't save every dog. It's 10x more humane to wait in this situation than to deceptively adopt out a dog like this to a family with kids. Once a dog has a human bite record, they are basically doomed to BE regardless of how sweet they are. Rescue is harsh. Sometimes animals are hard to rehome. It is irresponsible and negligent to adopt out a dog with unknown reactions to children to a family with kids. You are so not the asshole here and anyone who says you are has not worked in rescue.", "NTA\n\nImagine if they adopted him and something happened to the children because of him. Yes it\u2018s sad and sucks that he might be put down but you would never forgive yourself if the children are hurt because of you.", "NTA at all. Their behavior is the reason that there is a dog problem. Dogs get matched up with people they are not a good fit for,\n\nMaybe you saved a kid's life by doing so, or at least saved them from getting hurt seriously.", "Jumping in here as a trainer (holding multiple certifications and credentials) and also as a veterinary technician that works in behavior medicine and with multiple rescues and used to work in a shelter. You are NTA.  Not in any way, shape, or form. Anyone who says that you are doesn't understand rescues. Doesn't understand behavior and are speaking from strictly an emotional standpoint because they want and believe every dog can and should be saved. This is just not true. I'm cases like Stevie',  it is much better to err on the side of caution and not send a potentially dangerous, and reactive dog into a home with children without first knowing how he is with children. It would have been highly irresponsible and completely unethical to not warn the family that he is reactive and untested with children. It was absolutely appropriate to express your concerns to the family. Not every dog can be saved. Not every dog should be saved. And it is better to euthanize a reactive dog that is potentially dangerous than to put anyone in danger and to make room for more adoptable dogs that are safe to be adopted.", "Yikes NTA and what you co-worker is doing is super unethical. It's a hard enough world for pitty breeds without people placing rescues in inappropriate homes. I'd report him and if you're pushed out have a chat with the media...", "NTA \n\nThat was super irresponsible of the shelter to mislead that family. If only a few people can touch him, that's a huge red flag for families with children. You might have saved both a kid from being injured and that dog from being put down after it injured someone. \n\nIt's super sucky that they're a kill shelter.

I\u2019ve had dogs all my life but recently my niece(whom I babysit) has developed an allergy to dogs. Because of this I decided not to get another one after my dog Luna passed away until my niece gets to grade school in a few years.\n\nA few months ago a dog named Stevie was brought in. He was found near the highway and probably been abandoned. He had some old scars and was very skittish. He is probably pitbull mix but there is no genetic testing so we aren\u2019t sure. He is very nervous all the time and doesn\u2019t react well with other dogs so we keep him separately. Only me and a few other staff can touch him. I\u2019ve had reactive dogs and in my opinion he can really only go to a home with no kids, cats or other dogs. But those are rare and most people who adopt already have another pet. \n\nStevie has been in the shelter for 7 months and we are worried he might be put on this list to be put down soon. We listed his reaction to children as unknown but personally I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with him with my niece or other children. \n\nA family came in and asked about him and one of the staff that can touch him and that he seems to like talked to them and told him he was good with kids. I was pretty shocked because of his behavior but he wasn\u2019t put as not recommended for children. The family saw a few dogs and was debating between Stevie and another dog who is much more comfortable around humans. Stevie is only 3 years old so probably that\u2019s why they wanted a young adult. \n\nI was leaving and spotted them talking about the adoption outside and they spotting me because I was one of the people they talked to and the kid waved. I went over and they said they were still thinking between Stevie and the other dog. I couldn\u2019t hold my mouth any longer and admitted Stevie is reactive and unknown with children but is dog reactive definitely and in my opinion shouldn\u2019t go to a home with kids. The parents were shocked and asked me why the staff told them Stevie was ok with kids. I said I didn\u2019t know but internally I know it\u2019s because he might be put down if he wasn\u2019t adopted because we are overcapacity from abandoned pets during the pandemic. \n\nI left but a staffer saw me and confronted me a week later because the family left without adopting a dog when they seemed pretty adamant before they wanted one. I admitted it was probably because I told them Stevie isn\u2019t a good fit with kids but they are mad because I\u2019m not a trainer but neither are they. This is a small private rescue and they didn\u2019t have a trainer evaluate him. They are mad at me because Stevie lost his possibly only chance to get adopted but I\u2019m adamant he should go to a home with children.

If you feel the shelter isn\u2019t properly evaluating dogs, say something to management.  If you have concerns about a dog, take those concerns to management.

You don't mess with a dog that might bite a kid. You can't ever trust them. And even though I'm a single person who does not intend to have kids, I have neighbors who have kids.

This coworker lives in an apartment building in the heart of downtown and it\u2019s impossible to avoid other dogs, plus since they don\u2019t have a private yard the only place to exercise the dog would be at dog parks. After a few close calls and a consult with a behaviorist, she had to make the heartbreaking decision to return the dog to the shelter because he was too dangerous to keep in that kind of environment. She made it very clear that he was dangerous around other dogs and that he needed to be in a home where he would not be around them often.\n\nGuess what the shelter did?

I've done lots of volunteer work at a shelter and I agree 100% that you did the right thing.  I'm really bothered that a dog is even made available for adoption without having been through a thorough behavioral evaluation that includes an opinion on whether they're safe with children.  All of our dogs go through that evaluation which includes having their tails and ears pulled, sudden loud noises, etc.  Because if there a chance something will trigger them to bite it's essential that we know that and ensure they not go to a house with children.  Kids are much more likely to do something inappropriate that sets a dog off - out of ignorance, not maliciousness.  And because their faces are easily accessible to dogs, bites to children are usually much more severe than bites to adults.\n\nMy heart breaks for Stevie.  But it would be worse to send him home with an inappropriate family, have a child get seriously hurt, and then have Stevie put down.", "NTA\n\nAs heartbreaking as it is, putting Stevie in a home with kids when he's reactive is not good.

My dad was attacked by one not long ago and spent the night in A&E. He\u2019s okay but it is amazing the damage a medium sized dog did to a big dude before he and two other adults could control him. If you had any reason to believe he was even a potential danger to kids you absolutely did the right thing telling them. Dogs can do serious damage to kids even if they\u2019re never left alone with them. They\u2019re strong and fast with sharp teeth and claws. No parent should expose a child to one they are not one hundred percent certain is safe, and to deliberately put them in a situation where they did so unknowingly is disgusting. You may well have spared a child a painful and traumatising injury.", "NTA!! We have kids come into the ER all the time with dog bites to the face from the \"family\" dog. It usually requires them going to the OR for repair with permanent scars. I love animals, but not at the expensive of someone's kid! What this rescue did was BS!!", "NTA but as a fellow animal shelter volunteer, I have some advice on how to help Stevie. \n\nIt\u2019s already been said a lot, but you telling the family the full story about Stevie\u2019s behavior (or lack of information about how he would behave) was definitely the right thing to do. However, I feel like you can take this openness even further and disclose everything, including how he may be euthanized and his tragic past. That way, this family can really have a full picture of who this dog is. If they really were interested, would you be able to offer a trial adoption/foster-to-adopt situation or something like that? Or could something like this be an option for other potential adopters?\n\nBut hey, it sounds like at the end of the day, they probably weren\u2019t the right fit. However, if you want to try and help Stevie get adopted (which might help soothe your coworkers as well), I think being open about how at risk he is could be really beneficial. That kind of stuff really gets to people and could bring in the right kind of potential adopters. \n\nFor example, I recently caught a super aggressive cat off the street who was 15 years old and hated people. She managed to get adopted within days because she had an incredible story (owners lost her 10 years ago and when we scanned the chip and called, they didn\u2019t want her back). I know this is different than your situation and that cats aren\u2019t as potentially dangerous as dogs, but there are adopters out there who aren\u2019t afraid of a challenge. \n\nDoes your shelter have a social media account? Maybe they could make some posts about him telling his story and highlighting the concerns about his future. I think that could increase your chances of him finding a home where he\u2019ll fit. Instead of shying away from it, maybe it can be the reason he gets adopted.", "NTA.\n\nIf you telling this couple this information made them walk away from getting a dog, they weren't ready to have a dog, and them adopting a dog probably would have just resulted in them bringing the dog back, hopefully before the dog bit their kid.\n\nIt sucks for Stevie. It sucks that you don't have the resources to get him fully assessed, or fully trained, or that you can't put him in a foster home, or that we have to euthanize dogs at all. I hate it, you hate it, we all hate it. But until we can all learn to spay and neuter our pets and stop buying dogs from breeders, this is going to continue to happen.\n\n*Maybe* you could have softened your language a bit. I probably wouldn't risk it if I had kids, but I think there's a difference between \"we know he doesn't like kids\" and \"we don't know how he'll do with kids but we know he reacts poorly to XYZ things.\" Maybe there are families who would have used that information and made some decisions about their family and decided to take the chance, and you took that opportunity away from them by offering such strong language. It's much more likely they would have made the same decision if you'd offered up a slightly different but still honest interpretation though.", "YTA what the fuck is wrong with you. Let the family make that decision with a professional. I\u2019ve had dogs my whole life too and I wouldn\u2019t pretend to be a know it all when it comes to dog\u2019s behavior. \n\nWhy would you go out of your way to keep this dog from a loving family. That\u2019s already going to a shelter knowing these dogs had difficult backgrounds. \n\nWhat happened is not only did they not adopt Stevie but they lost their trust in you guys as a shelter because you disagreed with another volunteer.

He bit several times, including me, and despite our work with trainers and meds, we eventually had to put him down under pressure from our landlord, who understandably needed us to get rid of a reactive animal on his property. We tried to get help from the shelter and they said it had been too long for them to take him back. It was honestly heartbreaking. If they'd been honest about what kind of animal he really was, he could have gone to a family with the resources and knowledge he needed to at least attempt a normal life for him. We didn't have that, and nobody could help us get it, and he died for it. I think about him all the time, and I console myself that we were able to give him a few well loved months at the end of his life, despite our challenges. \n\nAnyway.... OP is preventing exactly this situation by being honest. It's honestly better for everyone.", "Many municipal shelters enjoy government immunity. They brag about it and bank on that when they write misleading shit about dogs in their care. It usually creates more barriers to appropriate homes for dogs and heartache for the people who tried to adopt them.", "Agree - I'm the biggest dog lover in the world and have opened my home to a number of rescues over the years and volunteered in dog rescue for a decade. There are some dogs for whom euthanization would be a mercy and this dog sounds like one of them.", "Dog breeds have many different shapes and structures of jaws. Do you seriously think the jaw of a pug has the exact same shape as that of a borzoi? Also, why would jaw shape specifically determine species when body shape, face shape, tail shape, etc. clearly vary greatly among dogs despite them all being the same species? They're the same species because they have fertile offspring when they interbreed.\n\nI know what you mean, because the idea that pit bulls have super special locking jaws is a myth. But American Pit Bull Terriers are *terriers,* and as anyone who has ever seen a pointer can attest, you can breed behaviour into dogs. Terriers were bred to be \"game\"-- to be undeterred by pain and the threat of physical injury. They were also bred to bite down, shake, and not release their prey until it was dead. These are traits all dogs are capable of (as they are descended from wolves), but were specifically selected for and amplified in terriers. These are the traits that made them so effective at killing rats, foxes, and other pests, which is what terriers were originally bred to do.\n\nPit bulls are also *bull* terriers, resulting from a history of crossbreeding bulldogs (bred for bull-baiting, i.e. attacking bulls for entertainment) and terriers in order to create the best possible dog for dog fighting: a dog that will show no fear and continue attacking in a confrontation with even a much larger animal, no matter what injuries it sustains. They are bred to be dog-reactive: their *purpose* was to fight other dogs, so of course they will be inclined to fight other dogs. That doesn't make them bad dogs or necessarily dangerous to humans. But an 80 lb pit bull terrier bred to bite, and bite, and not let go even as you batter it can do a hell of a lot more damage than a 15 lb jack russell bred with the same \"keep biting\" instinct.\n\nAlso, not really related but how does 5% of a dog's genes being related to appearance mean you can't tell a dog's breed by appearance? There's less percentage difference between human and chimp DNA and I'm pretty sure I can still tell a human from a chimp by looking.", "I feel a little awful about it but we got our last dog because a friend went through a breakup where neither could keep the dog alone. He needs a family. He is my friends dog, but he's ours now.\n\nAnd like, I feel awful because it was really the best way to get a dog. He's been trained, loved, cuddled. I know my friends and they are kind so this dog never saw a smack in his life. I know his allergies, his medications, shit we even go to the same vet just to make it easy. The vet knows of the switch and keeps us informed of anything our friends forgot to tell us.\n\nHe's rambunctious, hyper and a bit of an ass, but he's a good boy and the situation was \"perfect\". We had too many (3 yrs worth) misses with the shelter and trying to get a good dog to be friends with our Old Boy.\nNow we've had the new boy about 8 months and he fits right in.", "He should have been put down. He has probably since killed a cat or even several.", "[removed]", "Ummm even \"sometimes chases cats\" should have been a no for you. Any dog that has not been raised with cats should never be in a house with cats. A completely innocent dog can still lose an eye if they happen to come around a corner and startle a cat. The incident was 90% your fault imo", "It does happen so frequently with privately run shelters. I think it's a mix of the hero complexes of the people who run them (they want to save as many dogs as possible at any cost) and sometimes not seeing situations with a clear, unbiased perspective. \n\nI volunteered in rescue for 10 years and am very familiar with the area rescues. A lot of people in my personal life come to me looking for help and advice when it comes to adopting. There are some rescues I tell them just to 100% steer clear of, but even with the good ones, I encourage them to work with rescues that foster their dogs. My experience has been that the foster families give a much clearer picture of how the dog will behave in a home and after decompressing a bit and are generally frank about the good and bad points of each dog (and NO dog is perfect, NONE). \n\nI don't get the shelters that do these risky placements. I love dogs and I have advocated for them much of my life, but there are most definitely dogs out there who are beyond help and for whom euthanization would be a mercy.", "That\u2019s really not comparable, as no one was in danger.", "I have actually found muni shelters to be the most forthright in their descriptions of the dogs and cats in their care. It's some of these private shelters run by borderline animal hoarders that you need to be wary of.", "You don't even have to jump to the horrible case of mauling. It can still be an extremely stressful, unhappy circumstance with a non-violent anxious/aggressive dog. I rescued a dog where they did not adequately warn us of their severe anxieties and aggression (never bit, but herded and played rough). An extremely horrible situation for months on end, that eventually we were able to help and train the pup to be nice and calm and well behaved, but in a house with other dogs or kids... yeah, no way. I'm very proud we were able to help our dog who likely would have been put down in other circumstances, but you don't sign a random, unsuspecting, and unequipped family up for that", "I was unaware that expertise in identitifying dog breeds was a requirement for being a judge. But since three judges said it, all the research by people with actual expertise must be wrong. Got it.", "The point is that pit bulls are just dogs, they're not structurally or behaviorally different from other dogs. Pit builds have been bred for a lot of things, not just fighting. And even dogs that were bred for fighting were bred to have bite inhibition toward humans; no dog handler or spectator wants to be bitten.\n\n[Genetics goes to the dogs, finds there\u2019s not much to breed behavior] (https://www.google.com/amp/s/arstechnica.com/science/2022/04/genetics-goes-to-the-dogs-finds-theres-not-much-to-breed-behavior/amp/)", "Keeping a dog outside 100% of the time is usually against adoption contracts.
