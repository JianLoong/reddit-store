I\u2019ve had dogs all my life but recently my niece(whom I babysit) has developed an allergy to dogs. Because of this I decided not to get another one after my dog Luna passed away until my niece gets to grade school in a few years.\n\nA while ago a dog named Stevie was brought in. He was found near the highway and probably been abandoned. He had some old scars and was very skittish. He is probably pitbull mix but there is no genetic testing so we aren\u2019t sure. He is very nervous all the time and doesn\u2019t react well with other dogs so we keep him separately. Only me and a few other staff can touch him. I\u2019ve had reactive dogs and in my opinion he can really only go to a home with no kids, cats or other dogs. But those are rare and most people who adopt already have another pet and/or kids. \n\nStevie has been in the shelter for 7 months and we are worried he might be put on this list to be put down soon. We listed his reaction to children as unknown but personally I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with him with my niece or other children. \n\nA family came in and asked about him and one of the staff that can touch him and that he seems to like talked to them and told him he was good with kids. I was pretty shocked because of his behavior but he wasn\u2019t put as not recommended for children. The family saw a few dogs and was debating between Stevie and another dog who is much more comfortable around humans. Stevie is only 3 years old so probably that\u2019s why they wanted him as he is a young adult that\u2019s not too large. \n\nI was leaving and spotted them talking about the adoption outside and they spotting me because I was one of the people they talked to and the kid waved. I went over and they said they were still thinking between Stevie and the other dog. I couldn\u2019t hold my mouth any longer and admitted Stevie is reactive and unknown with children but is definitely dog reactive and in my opinion shouldn\u2019t go to a home with kids. The parents were shocked and asked me why the staff told them Stevie was ok with kids. I said I didn\u2019t know but internally I know it\u2019s because he might be put down if he wasn\u2019t adopted because we are overcapacity from abandoned pets during the pandemic. \n\nI left but a staffer saw me and confronted me a week later because the family left without adopting a dog when they seemed pretty adamant before they wanted one. I admitted it was probably because I told them Stevie isn\u2019t a good fit with kids but they are mad because I\u2019m not a trainer but neither are they. This is a small private rescue and they didn\u2019t have a trainer evaluate him. They are mad at me because Stevie lost his possibly only chance to get adopted but I\u2019m adamant he shouldn\u2019t go to a home with children. Some of the staff want me gone because I overreached when I\u2019m just a volunteer and some agree that Stevie can\u2019t go to a family with kids.

Yes. But would it be worse if Stevie mauled a child and *then* got put down? Absolutely.\n\nThe adopters need to be able to make an informed decision. Being told he\u2019s \u201cgood with kids\u201d is misleading and dangerous, because his reaction is unknown. He should go to a home without kids or other pets, and preferably with someone knowledgeable in dealing with reactive dogs.", "This scenario actually happened where I live, 2 years ago. A shelter adopted a dog out and told the new owners it was ok with kids and other dogs. Knowing tthat the family had a dog, and 2 kids between 7-10. Not even 24 hrs after they brought the dog home, it attacked their oldest child ( needed over 100 stitches to their face ) then attacked and killed their dog. And no, the dog wasn\u2019t left alone with the kid or other dog. Parents were in the room. It just happened that fast. The adopters did some research, and found it had a history of attacking animals and humans, and was moved to a different area so it would be put down. Also, the animal rescue was aware of this. They were told not to adopt out to anyone with children or other animals. And the rescue only had the dog in their possession for 48 hrs before adopting it to this family. Not long enough to be able to judge what family it would suit best. More research showed this rescue had a long history of doing things like this. OP, you did the right thing. It may not have been your job to tell the family that the dog wasn\u2019t good with children. But it was the right thing to do. If something had happened, and you knew you could have stopped it, you would never forgive yourself.", "NTA\n\nThe last thing this rescue wants is a lawsuit.\n\nIf Stevie bit the child, they would and can sue the shelter for neglectful behavior and purposeful child endangerment.\n\nThis is why most large scale shelters have proper behavioral screening or take no chance and disclose everything to avoid being held accountable.\n\nYou did them a favor.", "NTA\nStevie MIGHT get put down if he stays. He will DEFINITELY be put down if he bites a kid", "oh my god, NTA and you need to report that staff member to someone higher up. it is insanely fucking dangerous that they would blatantly lie about such an important safety issue. you say it\u2019s unknown how he reacts to children, so definitively telling them that he is good with kids is a bald-faced lie. children are attacked by, mauled, and even killed by dogs more often than most people realize, sometimes without any previous warning signs. i\u2019m not trying to demonize dogs btw i have 3, but children are unpredictable and can trigger a reaction from even the most harmless looking dog. you are a good person for warning them, please don\u2019t let that scummy staff member make you feel differently.", "NTA - I volunteered at a shelter and you did the right thing. The shelter should be doing due diligence to make sure he goes to a home that's prepared so that no one is injured.", "NTA I'm a volunteer at a dog rescue too, aside from the dog coordinator who manages everything it's all volunteer run so I can't really say anything about you \"just being a volunteer\". We also deal with difficult dogs sometimes, and it's important that people know what they are getting into when they adopt a dog, the person who told them he was good with kids shouldn't have lied and should have said they don't know. Ultimately I do think you did the right thing. If they had adopted Stevie and he wasn't good with the kid he likely would have been returned anyway (not to mention how someone could have gotten hurt!) That back and forth into an unfamiliar environment with strangers after a tentative feeling of safety at the shelter would be stressful for Stevie and would have been unnecessary stress when he was returned, which could make his reaction to being rehomed again even more stressful.\n\nIf you guys are worried about Stevie being put down, try and reach out to no kill shelters and rescues that work with problem dogs, they may be able to take him in. We get a fair amount of dogs from shelters at my rescue.", "NTA, the family left without adopting because they were upset about being lied to, and couldn't trust the shelter. If they're willing to lie to people about one dog, who's to say they're not lying about the others. I'd have left too. You did the right thing, NTA at all.", "NTA \n\nIf Stevie is reactive and is unknown with kids then who is going to volunteer their little kids to be the one he is tested on?\n\nMaybe that person saying he is fine can bring in their little kids. \n\nLittle kids move too fast and are too unpredictable for reactive dogs", "NTA. \n\nIn my experience, if the dog is reactive to other animals, and can barely be handled by adults, there's a huge chance he could hurt a child. You did the right thing by being honest. That family probably walked away because the staff was more than willing to put a potential danger in their home, just for the sake that he won't be euthanized. What Stevie needs is a foster home and lots of handling.", "This is a known issue with animal shelters, which seem to be above reproach for some reason.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you might have saved that family from having to go through one of the worse experience in their life. At the end of the day a human life is more valuable than that of a dog, and if I had to pull the trigger to save the life of a child vs anything else, it will always be anything else as I don't believe that anyone who is incapable of being able to fend for themselves should bear the blunt of other peoples decisions.", "Stevie would be brought right back. The couple didn't adopt that day because they were lied to and now didn't trust the rescue. NTA.", "NTA\n\nOp you are my hero.   \n\n\nI have the most horrific pictures of my friends hand that was savaged by her rescue dog that was allegedly \u2018fine\u2019. This was a woman who has been a dog owner for many many years and who always takes rescue dogs.   \n\n\nThe dog was, despite the rescue centres protestations he was just a little skittish,  incredibly reactive and would not settle even with extensive work. Turning for no apparent reason and Biting her three times over the course of three months - with the final savage attack narrowly missing causing permanent loss of hand function.  \n\nwith regret they returned the dog to the centre on the promise it would be a no kill, permanent situation and not be sent out for rehoming again -  a few months later we see the same dog advertised as up for adoption - when challenged the centre even denied the dog had ever had a problem or bitten anyone. We showed them the  photos (very distinctive dog) and reminded them of the case and they changed it from general adoption to a no kids, no pets provision. I mean seriously - if her hand had been a kid\u2019s face or neck the child would have died - no doubt about it.", "NTA. If Stevie would\u2019ve gone home with that family and attacked that kid, the situation could be monumentally worse for everyone involved (you, Stevie, the family, and the shelter). When safety is involved, you don\u2019t compromise honesty.", "NTA, this will be the best for the dog also, they will require extreme care to rehab if that's the way their acting. If the dog has a chance of being put down I would see about maybe finding a no kill shelter that might be willing to take them in. Depending on the area some specialize in pitbulls since they are a hard breed to get adopted due to stigma. But remember that it might cost you your position there.", "NTA. You did a good thing. I know Stevie\u2019s in a bad situation at the moment but what your colleague did is simply unacceptable. They were  willing to lie to a family with young children about whether or not Stevie would be a safe addition to their home. If Stevie had bitten one of the kids, where would he be? Right back at your shelter with a bite history history attached and effectively rendered unadoptable, or worse, put down immediately. I know your colleague likely had good intentions but the outcome could\u2019ve been disastrous for everyone involved. Frankly, it sounds like the staff need to be retrained ASAP because this is unethical. I\u2019m genuinely concerned that so many of them think that this approach is OK.", "NTA. I work with dogs at a training facility, and I wouldn\u2019t trust a dog like that around kids for several reasons even without directly biting a child yet. If he\u2019s so nervous that you guys can\u2019t touch him, I doubt he will take well to a child pushing his buttons and not being able to see when he\u2019s stressed. There\u2019s a chance he would warm up and be fine, but if the day comes that the kid gets bit in the face and the dog might get put down anyway. At least inform people of the risks and commitment. Some people can handle owning a reactive dog and some people can\u2019t. It\u2019s a lifestyle change that most people aren\u2019t willing to do. When I adopted my dog from a rescue, they lied and they told me he was friendly with strangers and kids, then the second day we had him he bit a child at a pet store. I kept him because we don\u2019t have any kids and I figured if I didn\u2019t keep him, he\u2019d end up being rehomed a lot and probably put down. I know they knew his history, and luckily I\u2019m in touch with his litters owners so I know his whole history too.", "NTA.  You're a volunteer, what are they going to do? Dock your pay? Fire you? You did the shelter a favor by preventing a potential liability.  You did the family a favor by helping them make an informed decision. And I know it doesn't seem that way, but you did Stevie a favor, too.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a horribly sad situation, and the only person to blame here was whoever hurt and abandoned Stevie. You absolutely did the right thing, and I hope that an appropriate family steps up to save this poor pup.", "You were asked your opinion. You gave it.\n\nNTA", "NTA a dog that has an unknown reactivity to children should not be adopted by a family who has kids.", "You're NTA OP, in fact, I think you did the right thing. Because if they aren't sure how the dog might react to kids they shouldn't recommend for the family with a kid to adopt it. Who knows what might have happened if the dog got stressed out or smth and harmed the kid or itself?", "NTA\n\nIgnore everyone saying you don't know for sure it's a pitbull and those saying you don't know for sure it's dangerous to children.\n\nI volunteered at a shelter for a few years working with dogs. We cared for their needs and worked on socialization issues.  I can almost always spot a pit or pit mix. The jaws of a pit are unmistakable.\n\nSo many dog \"advocates\" don't seem to know what dogs are. All our known breeds were developed by humans to make certain behaviors automatic. Push the right button, and they'll execute the desired behavior.\n\nI had a water retriever that had never been to a body of water. When she was about a year, I took her to a lake with a tennis ball. She was completely ball obsessed and would chase that ball until she was exhausted. She wasn't trained to do this.  She had no choice.\n\nI've seen herder breeds with no training or exposure to farm animals. When they moved to a farm, the dog herded everything. Another herder, untrained, who herded everybody in the house. If we were gathered in the living room or kitchen and one of us went to the bathroom, the dog would chase us to the bathroom, wait outside the door, and herd us back to the group.  These dogs didn't intellectually evaluate the situation, count how many aspects of the situation ticked his herding tendencies, and then decide to act. The dog has no choice.  Not all herder or retriever dogs will express their breeding in the same way, but they will express it.\n\nPitbulls were developed to kill. Not to fight, to kill. This does not make them evil. This does not mean they can't be good companions. It does mean that dogs of that breed need special attention and understanding. And just as some breeds are more likely to roam or run, this breed is more likely to kill.\n\nWhile there are general actions that can stimulate aggressive responses, we can not predict an individual dogs every trigger.  An untrained dog can be more dangerous because their genetic tendencies have never been studied and understood. You can't train a dog to manage triggers if you don't know what those triggers are. \n\nWhile it's sad to have to put down a dog, it's better than having to put down the dog and bury a child.", "NTA because I always hear about reactive dogs getting pushed out to get adopted through dishonesty on the part of the shelter. That family was told he was good with kids- a lie, because it is unknown whether or not he is. Reactive dogs are really hard to find homes for but what is the best situation here? Is it the situation where he waits in the shelter for the right home (and is given the mercy of behavioral euthanasia if he can not find the right home), or the situation where he is adopted into a situation that may lead to a bite, which would lead to BE anyways?\n\nBehavioral euthanasia is demonized so much by those who haven't worked with reactive or aggressive dogs. As a reactive dog owner heavily involved in rescue, who has met other reactive dog owners whose only choice was BE, this type of dishonesty in adopting dogs out is often what results in BE in the first place. \n\nI think what a lot of people saying that you're the asshole here are missing is experience with rescue work and reactive dogs in general. Sometimes it just sucks and you can't save every dog. It's 10x more humane to wait in this situation than to deceptively adopt out a dog like this to a family with kids. Once a dog has a human bite record, they are basically doomed to BE regardless of how sweet they are. Rescue is harsh. Sometimes animals are hard to rehome. It is irresponsible and negligent to adopt out a dog with unknown reactions to children to a family with kids. You are so not the asshole here and anyone who says you are has not worked in rescue.", "NTA\n\nImagine if they adopted him and something happened to the children because of him. Yes it\u2018s sad and sucks that he might be put down but you would never forgive yourself if the children are hurt because of you.", "NTA at all. Their behavior is the reason that there is a dog problem. Dogs get matched up with people they are not a good fit for,\n\nMaybe you saved a kid's life by doing so, or at least saved them from getting hurt seriously.", "Jumping in here as a trainer (holding multiple certifications and credentials) and also as a veterinary technician that works in behavior medicine and with multiple rescues and used to work in a shelter. You are NTA.  ot I'm any way, shape, or form. Anyone who says that you are doesn't understand rescues. Doesn't understand behavior and are speaking from strictly an emotional standpoint because they want and believe every dog can and should be saved. This is just not true. I'm cases like Stevie's it is much better to errors on the side of caution and not send a potentially dangerous, ans reactive dog into a home with children without first knowing how he is with children. It would have been highly irresponsible and completely unethical to not warn the family that he is reactive and untested with children. It was absolutely appropriate to express your concerns to the family. Not every dog can be saved. Not every dog should be saved. And it is better to euthanize a reactive dog that is potential dangerous than to put anyone in danger and to make room for more adoptable dogs that are safe to be adopted.", "Yikes NTA and what you co-worker is doing is super unethical. It's a hard enough world for pitty breeds without people placing rescues in inappropriate homes. I'd report him and if you're pushed out have a chat with the media...", "NTA \n\nThat was super irresponsible of the shelter to mislead that family. If only a few people can touch him, that's a huge red flag for families with children. You might have saved both a kid from being injured and that dog from being put down after it injured someone. \n\nIt's super sucky that they're a kill shelter.

I\u2019ve had dogs all my life but recently my niece(whom I babysit) has developed an allergy to dogs. Because of this I decided not to get another one after my dog Luna passed away until my niece gets to grade school in a few years.\n\nA few months ago a dog named Stevie was brought in. He was found near the highway and probably been abandoned. He had some old scars and was very skittish. He is probably pitbull mix but there is no genetic testing so we aren\u2019t sure. He is very nervous all the time and doesn\u2019t react well with other dogs so we keep him separately. Only me and a few other staff can touch him. I\u2019ve had reactive dogs and in my opinion he can really only go to a home with no kids, cats or other dogs. But those are rare and most people who adopt already have another pet. \n\nStevie has been in the shelter for 7 months and we are worried he might be put on this list to be put down soon. We listed his reaction to children as unknown but personally I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with him with my niece or other children. \n\nA family came in and asked about him and one of the staff that can touch him and that he seems to like talked to them and told him he was good with kids. I was pretty shocked because of his behavior but he wasn\u2019t put as not recommended for children. The family saw a few dogs and was debating between Stevie and another dog who is much more comfortable around humans. Stevie is only 3 years old so probably that\u2019s why they wanted a young adult. \n\nI was leaving and spotted them talking about the adoption outside and they spotting me because I was one of the people they talked to and the kid waved. I went over and they said they were still thinking between Stevie and the other dog. I couldn\u2019t hold my mouth any longer and admitted Stevie is reactive and unknown with children but is dog reactive definitely and in my opinion shouldn\u2019t go to a home with kids. The parents were shocked and asked me why the staff told them Stevie was ok with kids. I said I didn\u2019t know but internally I know it\u2019s because he might be put down if he wasn\u2019t adopted because we are overcapacity from abandoned pets during the pandemic. \n\nI left but a staffer saw me and confronted me a week later because the family left without adopting a dog when they seemed pretty adamant before they wanted one. I admitted it was probably because I told them Stevie isn\u2019t a good fit with kids but they are mad because I\u2019m not a trainer but neither are they. This is a small private rescue and they didn\u2019t have a trainer evaluate him. They are mad at me because Stevie lost his possibly only chance to get adopted but I\u2019m adamant he should go to a home with children.

If you feel the shelter isn\u2019t properly evaluating dogs, say something to management.  If you have concerns about a dog, take those concerns to management.  YTA.", "[deleted]", "So often i read that the small shelters give wrong information just to get rid of the animal and to get the space again. Like not telling about known illnesses or behaviour problems. Because most people don't come back if they realize something is wrong, they get away with it. \n\nNTA", ">would it be worse if Stevie mauled a child and then got put down\n\nThat's the sticking point.", "This", "I hope that family sued the shelter, or it got fined, or SOMETHING jeez. What a terrible thing.", "What the fuck. I wish so many bad things on the people operating that shelter. Do they think they\u2019re doing something good? They ruined an entire family and a kid\u2019s life, not to mention just gave that dog a death sentence too", "shes just a volunteer, most likely will be let go", "And having the dog adopted just for him to react to the kids poorly and end up being.put down anyway isn't better!! \n\nNTA AT ALL!!", "stevie is about to be put down so thats a hell of a favor also most likely she will be let go and replaced with a volunteer that doesnt think by herself, not that matters to OP", "This should really be higher up. Pit bulls were bred for a specific purpose, I\u2019ve never seen any person saying it\u2019s \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against pit bulls respond coherently to the fact that 65% of the deaths caused by dog attacks in the last decade was by pit bulls", "Yes, yes, yes! I said pretty much the same thing. I'm a veterinary behavior technician who also works in rescue and this whole idea that every dog must be saved attitude is so dangerous.", "Same! Definitely NTA OP. I'm a behaviourist.\n\nPerhaps a good idea would be to reach out on social media though to look for dog trainers willing to donate their time. I know lots who look around to get \"hours and practice\" in", "keep in mind she has o expertise to say its a pitbull or is not good with children, now the dog is gonna die", "Yeah, dogs are dangerous.\n\nI personally don\u2019t like dogs but man.. there are so many children to get legit mauled by dogs. Hundreds of stitches, the dogs literally ruin their normal future because of it, extremely scarred face, loss of ear, nose, saw a girl who lost her top lip. Sure you can train a dog, but that sweet precious furbaby is capable of easily harming someone. seen it in many stories, one even killed a baby. Many of these victims are only little kids, all because someone wanted a dog, I understand not all dogs are aggressive in their life, but people who knowingly adopt aggressive dog breeds, or the dog like Stevie in the shelter no one wants because they are a danger. Makes me sick, how can the safety of a child be less important than a dog.", "Isn\u2019t it a dog separated from other animals enough for a red flag not to be assigned to home with kids? I mean kids are wild cards", "I was torn as to how I felt here and you summed it up well. I think it would have been enough for OP to say that from their experience, the dog can be reactive and that they haven't seen the dog interact with children (or whatever is true). That's offering the family information and being honest to what she's seen, which is honestly all she can speak to. The way OP said it, it absolutely broke the family's trust in the shelter itself and basically implied the staff lied. If OP had concerns, she absolutely should talk to the staff and/or a supervisor. Maybe it's possible the staff has seen improvement or positive interactions OP hasn't (assuming the staff member is there more than OP is as a volunteer). The staff should not be misleading potential adopters absolutely though. It's doing no one favors and will ruin its reputation as a shelter.", "realistically OP was assuming everything and has no expertise to come to a conclusion, wouldn't the shelter be held responsible  if the dogs bites? why would they be so adamant to send him away if like you said most likely it would be put down and they woud have a lawsuit in their hands", "This is the correct opinion.", "A reactive dog won\u2019t necessarily show as reactive when at the shelter with a prospective family. We didn\u2019t learn that a dog we adopted was reactive until we\u2019d gotten him home and had him a few weeks. \n\nOP is NTA. If Stevie had bitten a member of that family they could have sued the shelter and the staffer for telling them he was good with kids. Not to mention living with the guilt of placing him with that family!", "If Stevie was comfortable with the staff member, he might not have displayed reactive tendencies. But once alone in an unfamiliar place with the family and child especially (kids can be unpredictable), then he\u2019d be much more likely to react.", "They are introduced to him. I wasn\u2019t there but I was told he was on his best behavior then and let the mother and child touch him and wasn\u2019t comfortable with the father. This isn\u2019t always the case and he can flinch away or growl if he doesn\u2019t want to be touched. I think the staffer told them he was just shy and someone not familiar with reactive dogs would believe it.", "\u201cStevie is reactive and unknown with children but is dog definitely reactive and in my opinion shouldn\u2019t go to a home with kids.\u201d she did say his reaction to children was unknown and did mention that it was in her own opinion. and if i were that family i wouldn\u2019t adopt any dog from that place knowing that they lied about knowing his temperament. and being in a home with children is enough of a danger, they don\u2019t have to be alone with the dog. u got me on the allergies tho lol it wasn\u2019t quite relevant to the story\ud83d\ude02", "The issue is that *no one* knows if he\u2019s good with kids. But if he\u2019s separated from other dogs *and* growls at adults he doesn\u2019t know, then chances are very high he\u2019d be reactive with kids.\n\nIf it\u2019s unknown how he reacts to children, then it\u2019s *always* best to err on the side of caution. Because otherwise you could end up with a dead kid.", "I\u2019ve worked with him for 5 months twice a week. And I\u2019m not a trainer but neither is anyone else working there and he\u2019s never been seen by a trainer. The staffer that said Stevie is ok with kids has no training either she just likes him but also didn\u2019t foster him because she also has kids and dogs at home.", "You are full of shit. I am an actual cettified trainer with multiple accreditations and also vet tech that works in behavior medicine, OP acted appropriately. 100%. OP did the right thing. It would have been unethical and irresponsible to NOT say something to the family. Not every dog can or should be saved. And sending a reactive dog without veing tested properly with children into a home with children us just stupid.\nI don't believe you're a trainer at all. Not an educated trainer, at least.", "The problem is your labeling an animal without any experience. For a lot of dogs that is a death sentence. You do not know and testing a dog in a shelter environment really means nothing. Your better off shutting up and sitting down. \n\nI've been a behaviorist for dogs longer than you have been born. Your literally no one to judge a dog in a shelter environment. I am not even concerned about the dogs behavior at this point. I'm more concerned that a no body is speaking one dog behavior when they have no business doing so", "There are a great many shelters that do not act in good faith", "He has not been around children but he flinched or growls or backs up if someone tried to pet him that he doesn\u2019t know or likes. It\u2019s not clear who he likes or doesn\u2019t like. He is unknown with children but I\u2019ve seen how shelters and experience with more resources categorize dogs and Stevie would be placed in an adults only household there if it wasn\u2019t clear he is totally child friendly", "They were sued and it is still ongoing. But they were not shut down and recently there have been several cases of them stealing dogs. Not abused dogs, but perfectly well cared for dogs, out of peoples yards, and refusing to give them back. In all cases police have gotten involved and the dogs end up being returned to their owners. The police go to the owners home and check and see that the animal is well cared for. Even the dogs vet\u2019s, who know the animals, insist they are well cared for. But this rescue just keeps doing it.", "it would be pretty disgusting if they let her go for intervening in a situation where their employee lied and endangered children. if that happens hopefully OP can find another shelter to volunteer at.", "It\u2019s definitely worse, now the dog has still been put down but also a child got hurt. So not worth the risk.", "Taking a reactive dog and putting them in a situation likely to cause a reaction is a terrible thing to do. And if the shelter lets her go, there are many others that will be happy to receive the free help.", "Ok, and what would have happened to Stevie if he had a poor reaction to one of kids? \n\nThat's right he would have been put down...", "And the shelter had zero expertise to say that the dog was safe with children. The time to find out if they\u2019re right about that or not is not when you send it home with a family. Also, the dog isn\u2019t on death row yet, there are still chances for it to be adopted to someone without pets or children.", "you know that if they did end up adopting the dog, and said dog went at the child violently, that the dog would likely be put down anyway?", "Better than a child getting maimed, animals die every day for our consumption or just in the wild.\n\nDogs aren\u2019t more deserving of life than a coyote or a cow. Plus pit bulls have a pretty specific facial shape if they work around dogs I\u2019m sure they can tell. If it was a 50/50 shot than OP did the right thing.", "The dog would die either way if it attacked a human, and reactive dogs are 100% not suitable for families with children", "Not necessarily. My girlfriend had a reactive dog. Huge prey drive and would go after small animals. And was nervous around other animals her size. But LOVED kids. Absolutely was a little tiny baby with my partner's kids.", "No liability is assumed with an adoption. There are too many variables that come with a dog bite, though, it would not look good for the shelter's reputation, that's for sure. \n\nAny dog can bite under numerous circumstances. \n\nI will say this, that if a dog cannot be handled, and is a danger to staff as well as potential adopters, it will likely be put down. This dog being here for 7mo tells me that it had a level of adoptability that OP may not have been aware of, and should not have input their opinion to the adopters before consulting the supervisor.", "like maybe he was going to be a outside watch dog and wouldn't come in contact with the child.  plus I said IMO", "Wow, so she\u2019s not willing to put her own children at risk, but is fine with using other people\u2019s children as guinea pigs. Appalling.", "Also, trainer and veterinary technician that works in behavior medicine. You did the right thing! And it would have been irresponsible and untmethicak for you to NOT to speak up. Sucks for Stevie. But not everyone can be saved. And not everyone SHOULD be saved. You did right just based off of your OP and not including additional comments.", "That\u2019s a lot of words to say you\u2019d prefer a child to get mauled and possibly killed just so the \u201cno body\u201d holds their tongue.", "We're not here to debate hypotheticals.\n\nMy point was that you shouldn't be volunteering at a shelter if\n\nA.) You can't help yourself from acting against the interest of the shelter\n\nor \n\nB.)  You believe the shelter is not acting in good faith", "why he didnt got place in the adult only list? was it because staff was afrait the dog would be put down? seems odd they would roll a dice on a lawsuit byt ive seen people that really love dogs", "Holyshit, they sound like PETA's demented cousin", "Why? I can understand someone stealing a neglected/abused dog, but why would they steal dogs that are already in a great home?", "And these injuries are often life-impacting.  This crap where people put a dog over people's safety has to stop.", "not trying to start a discussion but youre assuming, stevie getting put down(plus the other dog who also didnt get adopted) is a fact", "no chances according to OP", "Do you think the kid never goes out in their own yard?? Or that a child should live in fear of going outside because their own \u201cguard dog\u201d might attack them? That\u2019s not a good solution for the child *or* dog.", "OP is one of a small number of people who can handle this dog - that puts it in their wheelhouse.\n\nAlso consider, if ither volunteers - who are adults used to rescue dogs - cant habdle this dog then is it safe in a home with kids? Would it be safe with **adults** who arent being told that the dog is selective with people?\n\nThis rescue isnt acting ethically. But OP acted to prevent possible harm to kids. It wouldnt even need to be a bite. Ive seen kids get knocked over by accident and hurt by dogs who were reactive.\n\nActing to protect kids is never the wrong option.", "You got it backwards. The shelter shouldn\u2019t operate if it \n\nA) won\u2019t put the interest of the families adopting AND the pet first \n\nor\n\nB) won\u2019t act in good faith", "Yes I think so. Most shelters I volunteered with in the past only put ok with children if there are no doubts the dog is good with kids. But I think they are desperate for Stevie to get adopted so they just omitted the info about kids on his profile and just said he was ok with kids.", "I 100% understand the family not wanting to adopt from that organization! Hell, if I was OP I would stop volunteering for them if they are willing to blatantly lie to customers! \n\nThat dog is reactive and they do not know if he would be with kids, but he is to other dog. It's not a stretch to think kids would be an issue as well. And yes dogs who bites children are usually put down."]}
