Just when I was getting ready my mom said that her and my dad planned to go out for drinks and needed someone to watch the kids again. I explained I\u2019d had these plans for weeks as it was a special occasion and that I was fed up of playing babysitter for them.

Expecting their teenage daughter to tag in as a parent when they want to sit quietly in another part of the house isn\u2019t ok. It would be one thing if they asked you to babysit for them occasionally or paid you for it but to feel entitled to childcare because you are the oldest sibling is pretty crappy.

They knew you had plans and didn't think to sort the kids out before making their own.", "OMG, no, NTA. You are their kid, not their on-demand free childcare. They had kids, not you.

They can't just expect you to be able to babysit at any hour for any length of time! You're only 16. Now is the time you should be branching out and having fun with your friends, not doing shift work. It's clear you care about your siblings and the problem here is the lack of respect given for your wants and independence. Like, you can't have kids and just go \"it's okay the older one will babysit\" they're still your parents kids. This isn't your job and the fact they're pushing all the responsibility onto you is really bad. Where I live there's a service you can call up if you're a carer who's struggling to deal with things, I don't know if that's the case where you are but if it is maybe tell them? The fact that you're only 16 and expected to care for your siblings at all times at the expense of your own social life really isn't great. Your parents are being very selfish.", "NTA. They decided to have children. A trip to the store can be done by one person, it shouldn't be an excuse for a couple's day out.

But I also think that it's important for kids and teenagers to have a social life and have fun.\n\nI think it's good that you stood up for yourself. Your parents sound selfish. I get it that they want to have drinks and some time for themselves. But they also need to respect your time and plans. That they call you selfish for celebrating the birthday of your friend and not ditching the celebration in the last minute, just because they want to grab some drinks, is pretty selfish of them.\n\nSet up boundaries. I think you should still be babysitting from time to time. But mak sure that last minute requests are for emergencies only. I hope that you keep standing up for yourself, but I also hope that you are willing to help your parents out from time to time. There's a thin line between standing up for oneself and being selfish. But there's also a thin line between helping others and neglecting oneself.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My babysitter is not available at the drop of a hat with no warning. Also it sounds like babysitting is just expected of you now, but you have a right to live your own life.

She can move in with another family member if that's an option to her or even a friend's place, she can tell them no. No 16-year-old should be looking after their siblings often.
