Your brother is a major AH. Tell him and your parents that in future if he is dropped off without your consent you will first call his ex-wife and explain what\u2019s happened and that your brother abandoned the child.

What a neglectful parent and it\u2019s a wonder he retains any custody\u2026I hope he pays child support for how neglectful he is to that poor child. I hope the kid enjoyed the trip with you!", "NTA. You had no obligation to take him, but you did and did something your nephew will always remember. You are awesome and your brother is an ass. \n\nTell him you\u2019ll call the police on him next time he abandons your nephew.", "NTA - you took care of the kid, which your brother is unwilling/unable to do. Why does he even want the custody he has if he doesn\u2019t spend time with his son?", "NTA\n\nAsk your parents if you should tell your brother they're volunteering to babysit 24/7 and without early notice needed.\n\nAlso, make sure the kid's mother knows. Who knows with whom he leaves the kid if you're not available/not convenient for him. For the kid's sake, she should know how little care the father gives the kid when with him. You can visit him or schedule trips/plans directly with the mother if you enjoy a relationship with your nephew.", "NTA, he dumped the kid on you.  Glad you could take him and have fun. Your brother is the AH!", "NTA. Morally you're absolutely in the clear. Legally I'm not so sure. But if you told him your plans and he still dropped the kid off at your place, then refused to answer any texts or calls... Kinda seems reasonable for you to assume he wanted the kid to go with you.

Yeah probably should have given the kid to bio mom BUT he dumped the kid on you, KNEW you were leaving town and just fucked right off. Kidnapping charges wouldn't stand. Sounds like baby momma needs to get visitations removed", "NTA\n\nYour brother is pretty lucky to have you.  If my nephew got dropped off with no warning and no communication I'd have called the cops for abandonment.", "NTA but please stop enabling your brother. Talk to your nephew's mom and let her know what your brother is doing. It sounds suspiciously like your brother is taking his kid for enough time to reduce his child support obligations but doing fuck all to actually care for his kid.", "NTA in any way", "NTA, and I'm sorry your brother is such a dick. Record him next time he agrees to something so you can let him hear how much of an inconsiderate asshole he is.", "NTA for legal reasons next time call the non emergency police line let them know your bro dumped the kid and you have him with you and you have to leave town and can't reach the dad. Just give yourself some  some extra time because CPS might want to have a few words. You know.child abandonment is frowned upon but this will protect you from kidnapping charges. Or heck just report his behavior to CPS because dad obviously don't want him.", "NTA. But you could have gotten in real trouble if the kid got hurt or something.

Did you not address it at that time?", "Hard to judge because the mother would have a right to be furious and could have gotten you in real trouble. \n\nI bet the kid had a blast, and I'm sure you're his favorite relative.

Of course make sure you tell the nephew if he ever needs you to ask anytime", "NTA. What an awesome aunt.

You turned a crappy time for your nephew into happy memories he will never forget. \n\nKeep being you. What a legend.", "NTA. But talk with the mom.

Your brother seriously sucks though", "NTA What a nice treat for the kid.", "NTA, next time he drops him off like that Id call the authorities about child abandonment. That or Id reach out to the mom and inform her he just ditched his son and you cant get a hold of him and ask her what she wants you to do. Frankly her getting custody changed over this sounds like it would be the best thing for the kid. Not to take away kid getting to see his dad but to make him accountable or more supervised. He gets visits and ditches the kid during them frequently it sounds like.", "NTA\n\nHey, you taught your brother a valuable lesson, got nephew time, and the kid probably had a ball. Hopefully, your brother will think twice in the future before dumping his kid on you without warning.", "NTA \n\nSend your brother a bill for everything you spent and your parents!\n\nDid they think you should cancel your holiday and babysit?\n\nGood on you for giving that kid an experience. \n\nYour brother and parents are both massive enabling assholes", "NTA.

You tried all day to get in touch with him about your trip and he said something came up take care of him pls. Which you did, you took him on your trip and took care of him, the same can't be said for you brother. I would contact the ex about all of this and start documenting every time you brother drops him off for you to take care of and for how long.

All the brother and the parents care about is how it will make them look if he loses custody in full, he CLEARLY is not interested in being a parent. And he only gets the kid a few weeks a year, but abandons him with his sister for most of it? Yeah...Don't even try to reason with your brother. Call the police next time, and make sure to tell them he has a longgg history of doing this.\n\nAnd reach out to the mother to see if she needs some help fighting for full custody and making sure he loses what little custody he does have.

You may not know him, but your nephew now has fun memories of times with his father's family.  It doesn't make up for being abandoned by said father, but it sounds like he had a good time and that will stick with him.\n\nMaybe the kid's mom will switch up the custody so you take your nephew a couple times a year, since your brother doesn't seem to give a single eff about his own child.\n\nDefinitely work with the mom next time, but nta.", "Bet this guys brother doesn\u2019t pay shit for child support", "He wants custody because it reduces child support payments to the mother.", "This would be a smart move for sure.\n\nPrevent your brother up front from trumping up charges, and help baby momma establish a paper trail.\n\nBut cover that ass, because you're not TA here, but you are in one of those rare situations where being morally right is legally wrong.", ">What, exactly, prevented him from doing that?\n\nThe fact that he would then have to take care of his son on his own for a few days, which he refuses to do.

He's 11, he knows his dad dumps him any opportunity he gets, even though they don't get much time together as it is. He doesn't need another family member dropping him like yesterday's trash. At least he has OP, willing to be a safe landing pad, and to give him a far better New Years than I'm sure he would have otherwise. \n\nOP, you are NTA, but next time let his mom know where you are taking him, and how she can contact you, and give her tge opportunity to say no, she'll come get him. (honestly, you should be letting her know whenever you have him, or getting your nephew to, if he has the means) Any trouble your brother gets in because of his choices is just the consequences of his actions.", "I agree with this. OP is NTA but the better way would have been to either inconvenience the AHs who are enabling the bad behaviour or inconvenience the ex-wife.\n\nOP's intentions were kind and pure but everyone took advantage of their kindess.", "It would be nice if OP were to keep in contact with the kid, though. That kid will still be heartbroken to have lost his dad and maybe OP can help make clear to him that it is not his fault in the least.\n\nNTA", "This!", "Agreed", "Damn. So he\u2019s even shittier than I realized", "Yeah if the kidlet would have gotten hurt despite child abandonment the bro could have sued. He would also have to explain why he didn't report the child being left without consent. Baby mama drama aside I would honestly suggest he try to open communication with her for the sake of the child.", "I agree, and I think offering to support the mother is a great way to establish a relationship with both the mother and the child. I think that's the best way to maintain a healthy relationship, and it would make it clear OP isn't one of the enabling assholes in this situation (the parents)."]}
