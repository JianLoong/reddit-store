My husband and I refused.\n\nAt first, my sister and brother-in-law asked us nicely, but when we politely declined, they started kicking up a fuss, arguing that my husband and I have no proper reason to refuse since the both of us are able-bodied, mentally capable, childless, financially stable, and otherwise unoccupied adults. All their other family members either have children of their own or are not able to babysit due to various financial/health reasons, and Mary and Bob do not trust babysitters. So, since our only excuse was that we didn't want to, Sam and I were the only ones who could babysit their kids. Plus, we are family, so that would be a nice thing to do.\n\nMy husband and I told them that we would be happy to babysit their kids for a few hours (we had done that many times before), or, at most, a few days, but a week was far too much. Sam and I both tolerate kids (we love our family though), but we don't like spending time with them very much, which is why we chose to not have children of our own. Therefore, a week with two young children would be very strenuous for us. We also both have full time jobs, and I was in the middle of an important project at the time my sister and BIL asked us to babysit. On top of that, Mary and Bob wanted to go a week before Christmas and come back on the 24th, a time period which happened to coincide with their children's winter break, meaning that the kids would be at home 24/7 with no one to care for them. Therefore, we would be forced to either use money out of our own pockets to hire a babysitter to babysit the kids we're supposed to be babysitting (and, again, Mary and Bob don't trust sitters), or one or both of us would have to take the week or parts of the week off. Both options were clearly unfavorable for my husband and I, so, we declined.\n\nTo put it plainly, we refused simply because helping would make us uncomfortable, which, when phrased like so, sounds very b\\*tchy. Because we were their only option, my sister and brother-in-law had to cancel their vacation because they had no one to leave their kids with.

In my eyes, it would make wayyyyy more sense to have close friends / family who already have children (who I'd assume their children get along with also) babysit their children. Because at least they're already accustomed to living with children. Why would they \\*want\\* them to stay with you, when you're not willing, nor able to watch and play with them all day. Not wanting to is reason enough, but it's not even just that you don't want to, it's that it would cause a lot of issues in your life that is not designed to accommodate children. Why would they want to stick their kids into that situation in the first place, my gosh. They should have planned their anniversary vacation by first finding a time when they know they have someone ready and willing to babysit the kids, not organize it the other way around --- smack in the middle of the holiday season no less!", "Oh hell no to this.  NTA  Without a shadow of a doubt.\n\nThey was wanting to take liberties.  You pay for a baby sitter whilst they with you.  They knew they had kids, its not like they just appeared on there doorstep.  They had the option to take the kids with them.  Sorry it doesn't matter what you do for jobs or projects or what ever, No is a full and completely non justified answer, you shouldn't have to defend yourself because you said No.\n\nIt sounds like they didn't plan correctly or if they did they \"assumed\" you would be fine.  Whats really funny here is they pull the \"we are family\" card.\n\nGood on you for standing your ground!", "NTA \n\nIt was them asking a favour not an order you are welcome to say no\n\nThat's the core point here the rest is just window dressing\n\nPerhaps they should have asked or thought about this *before* they booked this holiday knowing full well they had kids who would be off for the Christmas period", "NTA\nIn no way should they have planned a vacation before a sitter was hired. If they don\u2019t trust sitters they don\u2019t go out. That\u2019s all there is to it.", "NTA. Not wanting to is reason enough to say no. You didn't force her not to go. She wasn't willing to settle for anyone else.", "NTA\n\nas I started reading my initial thought was YTA. So clearly NTA though.\n\nYou are well within your rights to say no, for all the reasons given.", "NTA and one of the facts of life with children is that they're the parents' responsibility. Asking you to take time off from work to care for their children is a ridiculous request for your sister to make. They'll just have to wait and celebrate a different milestone anniversary.", "Clearly nta, no is a complete answer\u2026they wanted these kids so they need to take care of them\u2026they could have just took them with them on vacation\u2026", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t understand your sister and BIL. \n\n\u201c\u2026 otherwise unoccupied\u201d ???\n\nYou work full time, when are you unoccupied?? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that you felt uncomfortable looking after the kids for a week! You had to work!\n\nIf the kids weren\u2019t hard to care for, then a family member with kids could\u2019ve had the kids. It wouldn\u2019t have added much more to them, your sister didn\u2019t want to pay towards their care by another family member. They picked you because you have money and they wouldn\u2019t have to pay you (paying you for your unpaid leave would\u2019ve been more than a bit of food money to someone else).", "NTA. The entitlement is strong here. Their children, their responsibility. It's not like someone we're having a medical emergency or any kind of emergency at all. As a rule, you don't book a vacation expecting someone to care for your children. You make those arrangements *before* booking, and if nobody wants to help you out, you either don't go or you bring the kids with you. \n\nThe title is kind of misleading though - you have not forced your sister to do anything. She tried to force *you* to take care of her kids *for a whole week* - I mean, I wouldn't be doing that for anyone outside of an emergency - you stood your ground and the fallout is entirely her own doing.", "NTA. It is unfair of them to think that the two of you have to take time off work because they want to go on vacation. No! And just because you are childfree doesn't mean that you have to jump to help people with children every time they want. You have your life and also your own things to do and time to spend. If they can't accept that - they are TA. But not you", "Oh I just love the \u201cunoccupied since you don\u2019t have kids\u201d BS \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude44\n\nNTA!", "\"Unoccupied adults\"?! So you are magically financially stable without full-time jobs or you know have a full life that doesn't revolve around children. And because you don't have children that makes you unoccupied adults. Geez...NTA and I would step back from babysitting for a few hours from now on.", "NTA.  If the \"whole family\" is upset about this horrible affront, they are surely willing to take in the kids instead.  Right?", "NTA at all\u2026especially considering they fully expected one or both of you to take a full week\u2019s precious vacation right before the holidays\u2026 When you\u2019re likely competing with coworkers wanting the same time\u2026 Just to babysit their children, who they must not enjoy being around themselves. Why in the world did they schedule this trip when the kids are not in school?", "NTA. You have no obligation to take a week off or get a sitter for their kids. They need to make other arrangements for vacations without kids", "NTA\n\n\u2018Its not my responsibility to watch X and Ys kids at all much less for a week, I don't have to give up my time or comfort to help you, and if it's such a noble a good deed any of you calling me lazy can feel free to take their kids for a week.\u2019 \u2018The fact that we don't have children doesn't mean  our child-free time is up for grabs, it's ours to to do with how we like.\u2019\n\n\u2018Also, you trying to shame me into helping, has backfired, I WILL NEVER WATCH YOUR CHILDREN AGAIN.\u2019\n\nI'd also like to point out that they asked after planning the vacation to try to force the issue, hoping that knowing they'd have to cancel and maybe cost them\nthe money would ensure they agreed.", "NTA they asked and you guys answered. It's their fault for not having a backup plan and not having the funds for a sitter.", "That would have been me too.  My response would have pretty much been if I wanted kids, I would have had kids (we happily have none, and that boat has since sailed).", "I\u2019m going with NTA for saying no because it seems they asked on very short notice and either expected or didn\u2019t realize one of you would have to use your own vacation to make their\u2019s happen. I would hope if they asked with an appropriate amount of notice you would help them for at least a few days as you stated that would most likely be your \u201ckid\u201d limit.
