Steph married my eldest brother Nathan (30M) in May. It was an arranged marriage orchestrated by my dad and Steph\u2019s dad. My mum thinks steph is vain (she\u2019s just gorgeous), lazy (she\u2019s a stay at home wife), too westernised (she\u2019s american) etc. I\u2019m very close to my SIL as she\u2019s kinda like an older sister to me because my older sister is 32. I don\u2019t really get along with my mum either because i\u2019m bisexual and she thinks i\u2019m too \u2018wild\u2019 which in her books means i leave the house for things other than school. Stephanie lets me stay her & Nates house whenever my mum gets too much which is great because before Steph Nate was too scared to get on our mums bad side lmao.\n\nDuring wedding planning, my mum tried to steamroll over steph using very unhanded techniques but what she didn\u2019t anticipate was Steph throwing her techniques back in her face. Initially she didn\u2019t do anything about my mums actions and resigned herself to having no control over her wedding, but her step mother told her to get her act together. She faked a health scare due to the stress of dealing with my mother (she has heart issues) and used that to get my mum uninvited from ever single pre-wedding event. Nate has bad anxiety from our mums abuse so i\u2019m assuming that stephanie doesn\u2019t want to stress him out with dealing with her, and she has more fun dealing with her herself.\n\nNow, every nasty thing my mum does to Steph is met with something equally bitchy. My mum criticises stephanie\u2019s cooking, Steph will pretend that my mums food made her vomit. My mum criticises stephanie\u2019s weight (she\u2019s recovering from an ED), stephanie will invite my mum to the gym with her (my mum is plus sized), my mum will criticise Stephanie for staying at home without kids and spending \u2018all of her sons money\u2019, stephanie will call my mum out on being abusive. It\u2019s exhilarating to watch my mum finally be put in her place after years of being unchecked.\n\nStephanie\u2019s new tactic is decorating her house with fresh flowers (My mum has hayfever) and then insisting that she didn\u2019t remember. She started doing this because my mum criticised her for using fake flowers to decorate.\n\nYesterday, my family was at Nate\u2019s house for the weekly family dinner and my mum was complaining about the flowers. When i was alone with my dad in the kitchen, he made a comment on how Stephanie\u2019s memory must be bad because she kept \u2018forgetting\u2019 about the hayfever thing. My other brother Kyle said it was obvious that she was doing it on purpose and he thougjt it was hilarious, and my dad was shocked. I agreed with my brother and my dad said that it was wrong that we didn\u2019t think to stop Steph from irritating our mother but i think that the situation is between her and my mother and we shouldn\u2019t get involved. He\u2019s insisting that i\u2019m wrong and that i should tell Stephanie to stop before he \u2018goes to my mum\u2019 about it.
