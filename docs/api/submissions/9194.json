He's being lazy and putting a lot of stress on you.", "NTA \n\nAs someone who lives in what can be referred to as \u201corganized clutter\u201d I can somewhat see both sides to this.. but, you are completely NTA and your husband has inched his way into the AH category rather quickly. My co-parent is someone who insists on a clean and tidy house, and had a habit of pointing out what wasn\u2019t done while ignoring anything that had been done. While I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how you\u2019re going about things at all, it is possible your husband doesn\u2019t hear \u201clet\u2019s get this done before baby comes\u201d and does hear things as more of a criticism. I hope that makes sense and you don\u2019t read it as me saying you\u2019re putting it that way, at all. \n\nIt seems as though you have given your husband a good amount of options, as well as a more than \u201cacceptable\u201d time frame to get things done.. but, I think maybe talking about things one more time with a slightly different approach is the way to go. Again, your husband is the one who is at fault here.. because even if he IS hearing things as any kind of criticism, that\u2019s something he should be addressing with you (and probably a therapist, he should really get a feel for why in his brain this isn\u2019t a priority.. and hasn\u2019t ever been but mainly now with a baby on the way). Go into this conversation with an open mind and an open heart, expect him to probably be defensive and try to avoid feeding into that and defuse the conversation becoming a confrontation. You need to lay everything out in a way that will solve this problem and the bigger problem. He needs to understand that this isn\u2019t you forcing him to get rid of all of his things that he very obviously is attached to but clearing the space that is meant for your child, his child, the child that you both fought so hard to bring into this world. I wouldn\u2019t put a general time stamp on getting this whole thing done- more of maybe x amount of boxes this week, x amount next, etc. Also if your doctor hasn\u2019t put you on any kind of restrictions, let him know that while you understand his concerns with you lifting/moving things that you are capable and willing to help organize while he does the lifting? Maybe lists will help? Ask him what he thinks will help with the right now aspect of getting started. You should also make sure to calmly let him know that this is stressing you out and that stress is worse for a pregnancy than lifting boxes. \n\nYes, you have a deadline- and this needs done long before the actual deadline of your baby arriving home but sometimes putting a deadline on the whole thing makes it more overwhelming. Sometimes it makes things easier to have smaller tasks with short deadlines.. and while he is in the wrong, maybe having a different approach will get the results that are needed. Just trying to play devils advocate here, as someone who has trouble with long deadlines, keeping/getting organized. I also sometimes end up becoming more stubborn about doing things that need to be done when I am told to do them in a confrontational kind of way. Personally, I know these things about myself and have worked on them all.. but, it took ME to try and fix ME. I wasn\u2019t talked to in a problem solving way, it was always more of a confrontation and \u201cthis needs done or else\u201d/\u201cyou have until this time to get it done or I\u2019m doing it my way\u201d and that just made things worse. \n\nSorry for rambling. Just to be clear you are NTA and it\u2019s not your responsibility to \u201cfix\u201d your husband or his inability to motivate himself to get this done. He is at fault and needs to take a look at what\u2019s going on that\u2019s keeping him from doing this basic thing in his family\u2019s home. This is a him thing, not a you thing.. but, a little proper push from you could make him realize this, change this, and make both your lives better in the short and long run.", "NTA and this is how he\u2019ll be as a dad as well. \u201cWant me to stay home with you and the baby. We\u2019ll I guess I just won\u2019t have any friends then.\u201d It\u2019s passive aggressive and counterproductive. He also doesn\u2019t do well with deadlines so maybe renegotiate, like x hours tomorrow. X we\u2019ll do on Wednesday. Y on Sunday. \n\nAnd you need to address the headaches. Headaches every weekend is not normal and he may be sick. Why does he have them? What can be done to help with them, because it will only get worse with a screaming baby and no sleep. Has he seen a doctor? If he doesn\u2019t go to one and seek help, then he doesn\u2019t get to use it as an excuse.\n\nAs for some of the stuff you can probably help with. A lot of his collection doesn\u2019t weigh much and you could absolutely start carefully packing those away for him to carry on a later day. You may also need to downsize your collections.

I have made room for my stuff in my room and I cannot even get in there as it fills the doorway as well.\n\nI have now given him a deadline of Easter. Then my mum will come and we will clear it and his stuff will be put in his room to sort out.\n\nHis parents have given him until Xmas to clear out his stuff from their house.\n\nEvery weekend he either is out playing games or ends up sleeping most the weekend with a headache.

A messy room is not a serious problem. Let him clean it and move on. \n\nFYI - preparing a nursery can feel like a really big deal to first time parents. When the baby comes, you will probably find the room is virtually unused for months as the baby sleeps in your room and waking hours are spent in living spaces. It\u2019s a lovely feeling to have a nursery ready, but don\u2019t place undue stress on yourself just because BABY - you will still have plenty of time to sort out the last details.", "NTA.

Instead of taking responsibility and trying to fix it, he tries to turn it around on you as your fault to the point where you are doubting yourself. That's not kind or caring. You do not need the stress of dealing with this while you are pregnant. You are growing his child; the least he can do is clean up his mess. It is not a you problem at all. If anything, you are being ridiculously generous with him. Maybe showing him this post and the responses would help get him moving, but I doubt it. The fact that his parents are dealing with the same problem tells me he really, really needs help. But he has to take responsibility to do that and so far, he's putting it on everyone else.", "NTA. The deadlines and wanting to make room for your growing family is reasonable. \n\nI wonder if your husband is feeling pressed and overwhelmed by the upcoming changes, and having to organize and declutter years of collections and hobby materials is creating a 'wall of awful' that seems too high for him to climb. Kind of a Peter Pan thing--getting rid of that stuff feels like growing up in a way he wasn't prepared for. \n\nLook, it's one thing to have a deadline, but if he's procrastinating and avoiding the issue you'll need a plan for what happens when Easter rolls around and nothing is done. This could potentially be a big blow up. Make it clear that you are prioritizing your new family, of which he is an important part, but the first lesson of parenting is you don't come first over meeting a child's needs. (An infant doesn't need its own room imo but if you both agreed this room would be cleared out then that's the need that should be met.) \n\nMy bet is that this sounds like a huge and boring/stressful project to him and his preferred activities are a way from him to hide and not address his conflicting feelings. It's 2023, emotionally immature men are uncool. Get to therapy now. Watch episodes of \"Tidying Up\" with him (iirc there are some with pregnant couples or couples with infants, so you both can see how much work would need to be done if this isn't tackled now vs when the baby is here). Enlist family and friends to do a clean out day, where \"donate\" items are moved immediately to empty car trunks and zoomed off to the charity shop rather than sitting in boxes somewhere else. Get a skip or one of those you-fill-we-pick-up contractor's trash bags/bins. This will be the least of the hard projects you'll need to confront as parents, and he needs to step it up and take it seriously.

A room so full of \u201cstuff\u201d that you can\u2019t walk in goes way beyond disorganized or untidy. You enable this behavior when you minimize it. Call it what it is, your husband has a hoarding problem. That doesn\u2019t make him a bad partner but it is a serious mental health issue and it\u2019s not going to go away because your mom comes over and throws some stuff out. \n\nI\u2019d recommend starting out with the book \u201cStuff\u201d. It will get you into the frame of mind to understand what you\u2019re dealing with. \n\nNext, it is time to lay down some boundaries. If your husband is not able to make progress on this every week on his own, he needs therapy. I know it is difficult to make an adult see the need for therapy, but right now your husband\u2019s mental health problem is having a serious negative impact on your family. This needs to be addressed before the baby comes. It is not going to be fixed before then, but he needs to be in treatment with an established treatment plan. **This is a very reasonable thing for a wife to ask of her husband.** You might need to help with the initial legwork of finding a therapist and setting up appointments. I\u2019d recommend having him do consults with several, as it\u2019s important to find a good match for him. \n\nDo not let him procrastinate this with the idea that he\u2019s going to magically get motivated and solve this ongoing problem. He needs support. It\u2019s your job to help him find that support. He also needs to understand the magnitude of the problem. **Stop minimizing it for him.** Address it with love and compassion, but do not let it slide as a bit of untidiness. \n\nI know you still have a long time before baby is here, but behavioral change takes time and solving any serious problem like this in less than a year is a big ask. Treat this like the crisis it is and you will have the best chance of improving things before you\u2019ve got a newborn on top of the existing issues.", "You really make excuses for him huh?

The next (and last!) baby was 5 weeks early but we had him all set up well ahead of time! \n\nI wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re over reacting. We moms definitely go through \u201cnesting\u201d and it will drive you nuts when you can\u2019t get it done. It makes it harder because dad doesn\u2019t typically go through the nesting phase so they just can\u2019t empathize with our hormones and feelings during that time.", "Given the serious ADHDish vibes, he likely needs an even tighter deadline for something to actually get done. I doubt he\u2019ll make a move toward getting this completed until he\u2019s right up on the end date.", "My sister is an interior designer/organizer... she routinely \u201chelps\u201d me keep our stuff under control. (Between my husband, myself, 4 kids & 3 dogs we have a lot of stuff) My sister is a task master!!! The biggest help for us is having dedicated storage space for everything otherwise nothing ever gets put away. \n\nThings that people have emotional attachments to are the hardest things to organize & part with. If your husband \u201cloves\u201d all the board games & collections, he\u2019s never going to organize them until he has a space specifically for those things he loves. Sit with him today & show him cool storage units & things that he can use to display his stuff. It might motivate him. If that doesn\u2019t work, set up a bassinet on his side of the bed & program your phone alarm to go off, loudly, every hour. That might motivate him. Good luck & Congratulations!", "Could it possibly be that there's so much stuff that it's become overwhelming and he just shuts down about it? Maybe trying to get him to look at one or two boxes at a time or a section of the room might get him motivated.", "You\u2019re welcome! I understand everyone else\u2019s opinions and I agree with most of them in a way.. but, as a whole picture thing - you\u2019re a family, a team, so while it\u2019s not your responsibility to fix or change things.. sometimes it\u2019s better to take a step back and figure out what\u2019s going on with everyone involved.. not just you/he is an AH in the situation. I hope everything works out nicely, that things get organized, and that the three of you live your absolute best lives together for years to come in a beautiful happily every after.", "> Sometimes it makes things easier to have smaller tasks with short deadlines..\n\nSo much this!   I am a definitely a clutter person.   I really can't abide the sterile look that people seem to praise.   I do recognize that I tend to get stubborn even when my clutter is getting out of hand.   I deal with it by breaking things down and giving myself \"deadlines\" by which a small project will be completed.   It works well for me.", "Haha, this agreement will never stick.", "Honey 3 moves in 5 years and still no room for a baby. The issue has not been adressed or dealt with.", "Oh dear. Currently have a 6 week old baby. You might be being a bit optimistic there.", "Is there an arrangement for you to get time for yourself as well?", "It isn't every weekend. It's 2 weekends a month and 1 evening a week normally. It just doesn't seem to get done when he is home. He is asleep again now with a headache.", "Opinion:  this is a bad idea for you. Husband needs to be every bit as involved in night time stuff as you are. You need your sleep too.", "You will need his help at nights. Not the whole night and not every night but at the start it is constant. Although you don\u2019t want him to be so tired he can\u2019t work, you also don\u2019t want you to be so tired it\u2019s unsafe to look after a baby. \u2764\ufe0f", "Who came up with that idea?   Your husband needs to be a full parent, and that includes being disturbed during the night.   Even [this teen dad](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/u3b46r/im_16_about_to_turn_17_my_gf_is_pregnant/i4pm7t1/) understood that reality:\n\n\"*Also the 1st 3 months I would say stay with your gf help with nigh feedings dont let her do it herself.* \" \n\n\nHe had a full-time job and was going to trade school at night when his baby was born.\n\nTBH, this seems to be part of the overall picture of your husband prioritizing his comfort over getting things squared away to maximize the needs of all three of you.", "I find that just having someone else around is really helpful. Even if they're just sat on the bed, keeping you on task, and asking how the HELL you have so many spare socks. (This must not be someone you live with)", "It is definitely this.", "It might not be straight away. But I hope it will be at around 6 weeks.", "Yes I go out every other Friday. And some weekends as well. My hobbies aren't on as regularly. I also play pc games when I want. As I said everything else in our marriage is good. I just need him to sort this room out and his stuff so the house is safe.", "If he is getting headaches that frequently, he needs to see a doctor.", "Sleeping all weekend is screwing around. He can\u2019t do that when you have a baby", "They already have an agreement about free time but something tells me that he'll get it even it and she won't get any because he \"has a headache\".", "This was my idea. I am unlikely to be able to go back to sleep if we stay in the same room. He snores..  loudly. I find it difficult to go back to sleep. I know I won't be able to wear my ear plugs and feed baby so this is the best option for me to have a chance.", "So he is a hoarder. He needs help. What if the baby chokes on something? Or gets trapped during a fire? This is a big deal.", "At the moment I\u2019m at the stage that when we get a break it\u2019s used for one of us to sleep. Or shower. I actually had a bath the other day, it was amazing.\n\nOur baby is actually really good. He doesn\u2019t cry that much and he\u2019s ok with being put down sometimes. I hope you don\u2019t get a baby with Colic or a baby that won\u2019t let you put him/her down. Oh, or a baby that only sleeps for 40 mins at a time. We\u2019ve got it good but having a weekend off (or more than an hour) is a funny thought.", "Hope in one hand and crap in the other... you sound sweet but frankly naive", "It's his blood pressure. He is on meds for it which have helped a lot but it still gets bad sometimes.", "So you are already prioritizing his sleep over yours.  The his snoring needs to be addressed with a sleep study and possible treatment.    You are giving him too many passes to opt out of being a responsible parent and partner.n  \n\nGet a baby monitor and let him handle waking up for night duty.", "I meant 6 months not 6 weeks. Sorry brain isn't firing on all cylinders.", "He needs to get his meds and stuff under control before you have a baby that needs 24/7 care", "Baby brain is real.", "That seems a lot more realistic. \ud83e\udd70 Good luck with everything!", "I will ask him to get checked out.", "Sorry I\u2019m not trying to be bossy or impolite. I\u2019m concerned you\u2019re not going to have much help with your baby, and it\u2019s not something you can do alone", "I didnt take it that way at all. You are right he should get it checked again.", "I\u2019m a guy with two little kids and tbh I was like your husband before them. It was a rude awakening. Hopefully he can ease into it by starting before the baby comes."]}
