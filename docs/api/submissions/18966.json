Long enough for the 2 year old to push our baby to the floor and made him cry. (Later I found out what happened exactly watching our security camera). This made me furious, I was thinking \"If you accepted to take your two nieces over without consulting me at least watch over our baby and what they are doing\".  \nSince I am not getting any respect in this matter from my wife I texted my sister in law, showing her the camera footage, saying that my wife nor I could take care of so many kids right now, and that please ask ME first if she wants to bring their kids, since my wife will not consult me first. She immediately got mad and picked them up, although i said thats not needed that I just want to be asked first next time.\r  \nThis lead to a blow up argument, both my wife and her sister angry at me and I am now the devil.", "created_utc": 1685897644, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140iwzl/aita_for_telling_my_sister_in_law_to_ask_me_first/", "score": 408, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That said, wife needs to stand up for herself better since she cannot adequately supervise that many kids at once.  Not saying that in a judgy way (I couldn't either), be she she needs to be aware of the limitations, dangers, and liabilities.  It's not a day care and OP is legit busy working.  Again for the folks in the back: just because your at home working, doesn't mean you're not working.  It's amazing how many people fail to realize or respect that.\n\nThe folks dropping off kids with zero to 5 minute notice are also AHs, they obviously knew they had plans beforehand and just count on wife being a doormat.", "It is disrespectful to not consult both spouses on who is coming over/being left at your own home. If it didn\u2019t bother you, then it would be fine for your wife to accept, but because you\u2019ve made it clear that you aren\u2019t ok with this it\u2019s NOT ok.\n\nYour wife sounds like she has trouble communicating with you, maybe consider therapy so you both can learn the skills necessary to communicate with each other?\n\nI think it\u2019s reasonable to be angry when children are being dumped at your place short notice and you will have to pick up the slack because your wife is unable to take care of them all herself. This is not fair or respectful to your time or feelings.\n\nNTA.", "NTA,\n\nThis is definitely an issue between you and your wife though. It\u2019s ok to say no. Given how many kids you already have if she can\u2019t handle the extra kids then say no especially since you work from home and can\u2019t always help out. The bigger issue is a real lack of communication. Regardless who it is, you\u2019re married and you should always speak to your spouse before accepting/making arrangements.

Your wife has absolutely no respect for you and likely sees you as little more than an ATM. \n\nAre you also paying for everything for those three kids from another man?\n\nEdit: holy shit, checked the guys post history. ATM status confirmed. This dude is just spineless to do anything about it. Pathetic.", "NTA. My SO and I consult one another before inviting people over or agreeing to anything. That's way to many young kids for one person to deal with. Which means your help is required and you were not asked. Which is very rude.", "NTA. Ultimately this is an issue with your wife, though. You two need to be able to figure out how to talk. Her sister just dumping the kids into your home without everyone being made aware of/consulted and consenting to this is unacceptable (unless there is some sort of emergency, of course). I think maybe your wife and SIL need to be on a group thread with you and the requests to come over with children need to happen through there if your wife is refusing to talk to you before people just appear in your home. I would be upset too if I wasn't expecting guests in my home and this happened.  That being said, your tone in this post leads me to believe that you may not have worded this the most nicely to your SIL and perhaps that is why they are actually upset with you.", "INFO.

Your wife is putting your in an uncomfortable position.  Ultimately your problem is with your wife.  \n\nYea, you prolly rubbed SIL the wrong way by calling her directly but you had a good reason.  \n\nAsk you wife this, if a fire broke out in your house when she was alone with a baby, a toddler, and 4 preteens, how would she get everyone out?", "Ask her why she cares more about her sister and nieces, than her own children? You are working and can't help watch any of them, and she can't handle that many. She has been lucky with her neglecting your youngest. That push could have caused serious injuries to an infant. She's not upset about that, but is at you for wanting to protect your family?", "I'm going to be going against the grain and vote YTA.  A baby pushing over another baby is not an emergency.  Your wife has many kids and you just have the one so maybe you don't know but that's basically just Tuesday.  No one can directly observe children every second of the day.  Whether she was babysitting or not, she's allowed to leave the room.  She's allowed to help her sister out.

This is your home AND your place of work. You have a right to have a certain degree of control over both. Your wife cannot continue to allow the house to be overrun with her family when you work.

Children from 11 to 15 mostly take care of themselves. To handle two toddlers in a room full of toys is not more work than to entertain one child that has no other child of a similar age around. As you say, a child being pushed over is not an emergency. \n\nOP should mind his own business. Working from home does not mean he has a say in everything that happens there. If his wife likes to have the children around (maybe her children play much better if they have company), it is hers to decide. If he were not working from home, he would not even have noticed. He should stop to to be controlling. \"Consilting him first\"? No, really not.", "What? A baby pushing another baby could definitely lead to an emergency. Of course mom should be able to leave the room, but only if the baby is secure and not in the unmonitored presence of another child who doesn\u2019t understand anything about safety or injuries. There\u2019s enough horror stories available to understand that it only takes a few seconds for disaster to unfold, which is exactly what could\u2019ve happened here. They\u2019re lucky it didn\u2019t end badly, but it certainly could have  \u2014 all because mom was in charge of too many kids at once. OP\u2019s comment about \u201cI didn\u2019t want to deal with so many kids at once\u201d is tiptoeing asshole territory, but it seems like he\u2019s tried to bring this up before to no avail. Mom needs to learn how to say no.", "I think the term doormat is too mild for some people", "You've obviously never worked with children.  Toddlers pushing each other, biting each other, etc is absolutely normal every day stuff.  Obviously you correct the behavior but if you're getting all worked up over it, childcare is going to be a non stop anxiety fest.  Two toddlers hardly constitutes too many kids to watch.  The other kids are all older.  The baby has the same risk factors for accidents in the home without the second toddler.", "So just to be clear, you left your wife with six kids to go hide in your office?

You have time to review camera footage, but not to help your wife looking after your kids while the pay with their cousins. You think you wife would have been able to prevent the pushing incident somehow? It\u2019s an issue between your wife and yourself about her communication / relationship with her sister.

One wrong hit/fall can result in a traumatic brain injury or death. \n\nYou\u2019re right that two toddlers isn\u2019t too many to watch, but the fact here is that they WEREN\u2019T being watched. Six kids was too many for this mom at one time, and OP has every right to request that he be notified in advance before SIL drops off her kids so that he can be available to help. Why do you think that\u2019s a crazy ask?", "I don't think it's a crazy ask at all.  He asked about calling up the SIL and making demands that don't agree with his wife.  He's not the boss.  Neither is she.  They need to come to terms.  Yes, in home accidents happen and are tragic.  Yes, babies have soft heads.  They WERE being watched, though.  His wife was watching them.  She's allowed to leave the room.  You expect her to do nothing all day but stare at them?  Again, this wasn't an emergency.  The baby probably falls over all on its own accord thirty times a day.  If a toddler falling over makes you and OP freak this much, I consider you the one with half a brain.", "NTA you have a serious wife problem here. (Take a look at OP's history.)
