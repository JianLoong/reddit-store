You literally said you didnt want to handle that many kids so went to work. You could have stepped in and helped and you manipulated the phrasing of everything else to make her look lazy and weak. Your an awful partner and parent. Let's be honest your mad at your wife for taking sisters kids because you dont want to have to help parent even your own. Many hands make light work.", "ESH\n\nYour wife should be consulting you before agreeing to babysit her nieces not the SIL asking you since you aren\u2019t the one doing it.\n\n\u201cWatch so many kids\u201d \u2026 two; two is the # of children in this situation needing actual attention & being that your wife has a 12 & 11 yr old already she\u2019s aware of how much work os involved in caring for two children a year apart.\n\nYou are being unreasonable & the tone of this post suggests an attitude that likely explains why your wife is making decisions w/out talking to you about them - \u2018what\u2019s it matter to him; he\u2019s just going to disappear into his office on Sunday anyway\u2019 was likely her thought.", "It\u2019s funny, your wife can\u2019t say no to her sister but no such problem getting upset and will let you know it when you take a valid position.", "NTA, but make sure your wife watches the security footage. Ask her if doing/giving her sister whatever she asks for whenever she asks for it is more important than make sure her own children are safe, esp. the baby.\n\nAsk her to discuss with you what she feels she can reasonably handle on her own during the workday. If she's really willing to work with you she will set her limit and plan to say no to anything that is beyond that limit.", "NTA unless it was a genuine emergency like needing to take a different kid to the hospital level thing. Your wife needs to learn to say no. That is too many kids to safely take care of at one time.", "NTA. The SIL was disrespectful and so was your wife. But I could have told the SIL after she picked up the kid to avoid the extra drama. Hope SIL and your wife learns the lesson and be respectful of your space.", "Even if she *could* supervise that many kids, OP works from home. OP should have a say in any extra kids coming over to his workplace during the work day.", "Actually he does state it as the latter verbatimI \"Ok I though, i dont want to deal with so many kids right now so I went upstairs to work.\" He literally says he didnt want to deal with the kids so he used worked as an excuse even though he also admitted knowing she couldnt handle it.", "Ummmm OP works from home\u2026. It would be the same if your boss bought 6 of his/her kids into the office and let them run rampant whilst you\u2019re trying to do tasks, have meetings, run data analysis etc. plus it\u2019s pure principle, don\u2019t invite your kids over to be babysat last minute.", "My stepmom doesn\u2019t call me her kid, and I lived with her for 6 years.\n\nI have a mother already. My stepmom loves me, I am part of her family, but I\u2019m not her kid.", "Your male arent you?", "I know plenty of high ranking people that WFH and they don\u2019t have time to scratch their asses let alone watch a 1 year old, you don\u2019t take your 1 year old to the office, so why should he have to watch their 1 year old during work time at home.", "I don\u2019t understand why people are so worked up over this. If you can\u2019t do it - that\u2019s fine. \n\nI\u2019m at a director level and between meetings/client calls etc I can get grocery shopping, doctors appointments, housework and cooking done all while still putting in 40+ hours. My job allows for that kind of flexibility as long as I get shit done, sucks other people can\u2019t for whatever their reasons may be."]}
