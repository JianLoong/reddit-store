I work from home and my wife is a stay at home mom. Many times we argued because she accepts to have her family come over before consulting with me first or she just let me know a few minutes before they arrive.\r  \n\r  \nToday my sister in law (my wife's sister) brought her two children (2 and 11 years) and left them here, having told my wife a few minutes earlier. My wife apparently cant say no to anything so obviously thats ok with her. So i got a few minutes notice too of this, without being consulted. Ok I though, i dont want to deal with so many kids right now so I went upstairs to work.   \nGiven that my wife can't handle so many kids at once and we have a 1 year old baby that requires attention all the time, the 2 year old and our baby happened to be on their own, although for a short while. Long enough for the 2 year old to push our baby to the floor and made him cry. (Later I found out what happened exactly watching our security camera). This made me furious, I was thinking \"If you accepted to take your two nieces over without consulting me at least watch over our baby and what they are doing\".  \nSince I am not getting any respect in this matter from my wife I texted my sister in law, showing her the camera footage, saying that my wife nor I could take care of so many kids right now, and that please ask ME first if she wants to bring their kids, since my wife will not consult me first. She immediately got mad and picked them up, although i said thats not needed that I just want to be asked first next time.\r  \nThis lead to a blow up argument, both my wife and her sister angry at me and I am now the devil.", "created_utc": 1685897644, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140iwzl/aita_for_telling_my_sister_in_law_to_ask_me_first/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife obviously can\u2019t help being a doormat and SIL is taking advantage. You WFH and LO needs constant supervision, so she should be prioritising the needs of the people living in the house before submitting to her sister\u2019s requests.", "NTA. Your people pleaser wife shouldn\u2019t agree to babysitting her sister\u2019s kids when she already has her hands full with four children of her own. I don\u2019t see the problem with you texting your SIL since your wife has a problem with not being able to say no and not being able to consult with you.", "NTA, but OP and wife need to get on the same page here ASAP.  That said, wife needs to stand up for herself better since she cannot adequately supervise that many kids at once.  Not saying that in a judgy way (I couldn't either), be she she needs to be aware of the limitations, dangers, and liabilities.  It's not a day care and OP is legit busy working.  Again for the folks in the back: just because your at home working, doesn't mean you're not working.  It's amazing how many people fail to realize or respect that.\n\nThe folks dropping off kids with zero to 5 minute notice are also AHs, they obviously knew they had plans beforehand and just count on wife being a doormat.", "It is disrespectful to not consult both spouses on who is coming over/being left at your own home. If it didn\u2019t bother you, then it would be fine for your wife to accept, but because you\u2019ve made it clear that you aren\u2019t ok with this it\u2019s NOT ok.\n\nYour wife sounds like she has trouble communicating with you, maybe consider therapy so you both can learn the skills necessary to communicate with each other?\n\nI think it\u2019s reasonable to be angry when children are being dumped at your place short notice and you will have to pick up the slack because your wife is unable to take care of them all herself. This is not fair or respectful to your time or feelings.\n\nNTA.", "NTA,\n\nThis is definitely an issue between you and your wife though. It\u2019s ok to say no. Given how many kids you already have if she can\u2019t handle the extra kids then say no especially since you work from home and can\u2019t always help out. The bigger issue is a real lack of communication. Regardless who it is, you\u2019re married and you should always speak to your spouse before accepting/making arrangements. Because a lot of times said arrangement will also affect your spouse.", "NTA. Wife is spineless.", "NTA.  You work from home and are the only income supporting your family.  If your wife wants shelter and food for your family to continue than it's important for you to keep your job. Will SIL cover your bills if her dropping her kids off leads to you being distracted and loosing your job", "NTA extra people, even kids, needs to be a joint decision when you work from home, and it's during work hours.", "NTA \n\nDude get a clue. Your wife has absolutely no respect for you and likely sees you as little more than an ATM. \n\nAre you also paying for everything for those three kids from another man?\n\nEdit: holy shit, checked the guys post history. ATM status confirmed. This dude is just spineless to do anything about it. Pathetic.", "NTA. My SO and I consult one another before inviting people over or agreeing to anything. That's way to many young kids for one person to deal with. Which means your help is required and you were not asked. Which is very rude.", "NTA. Ultimately this is an issue with your wife, though. You two need to be able to figure out how to talk. Her sister just dumping the kids into your home without everyone being made aware of/consulted and consenting to this is unacceptable (unless there is some sort of emergency, of course). I think maybe your wife and SIL need to be on a group thread with you and the requests to come over with children need to happen through there if your wife is refusing to talk to you before people just appear in your home. I would be upset too if I wasn't expecting guests in my home and this happened.  That being said, your tone in this post leads me to believe that you may not have worded this the most nicely to your SIL and perhaps that is why they are actually upset with you.", "INFO. What would you do differently with advanced notice? What is your work-from-home setup?  \n\n\nThis is a tough one.", "ESH.\n\nWhere's the respect in this marriage ?", "NAH.  Your wife is putting your in an uncomfortable position.  Ultimately your problem is with your wife.  \n\nYea, you prolly rubbed SIL the wrong way by calling her directly but you had a good reason.  \n\nAsk you wife this, if a fire broke out in your house when she was alone with a baby, a toddler, and 4 preteens, how would she get everyone out?", "Ask her why she cares more about her sister and nieces, than her own children? You are working and can't help watch any of them, and she can't handle that many. She has been lucky with her neglecting your youngest. That push could have caused serious injuries to an infant. She's not upset about that, but is at you for wanting to protect your family?", "I'm going to be going against the grain and vote YTA.  A baby pushing over another baby is not an emergency.  Your wife has many kids and you just have the one so maybe you don't know but that's basically just Tuesday.  No one can directly observe children every second of the day.  Whether she was babysitting or not, she's allowed to leave the room.  She's allowed to help her sister out.  I get it's annoying but you seem to think you're the boss and for that I'm voting you're the A.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Wondering what she brings to the relationship besides the very obvious answer.", "No kidding. It is very clear that neither him nor his wife respect each other.", "NTA. This is your home AND your place of work. You have a right to have a certain degree of control over both. Your wife cannot continue to allow the house to be overrun with her family when you work. If she wants to go out at meet them somewhere else fine. But your house is not a day care center. Stick to your guns on this!", "NTA. Your priority is your family 1st. That means your baby son, his siblings and your wife. Since she's not capable of telling them no then it's on you to be the bad guy and enforce some reasonable boundaries in the home you share.", "NTA... your wife is unable to look after that many children safely - that is the issue. \n\nYou get a say in the safety of your children.", "NTA. Your SIL I'd rude to expect you to be drop off daycare, especially since your wife left the littles alone long enough for 2 to bully 1.", "Personally, I'd say the term doormat is a bit harsh, and people pleaser would probably be more apt.\n\nInterestingly, being a people pleaser can actually be a sign of psychological issues due to being neglected emotionally as a child and can lead to the situation where a person craves the gratitude of others and can't say no to anyone", "I was looking for this answer! Children from 11 to 15 take mostly take care of themselves. To handle two toddlers in a room full of toys is not more work than to entertain one child that has no other child of a similar age around. As you say, a child being pushed over is not an emergency. \n\nOP should mind his own business. Working from home does not mean he has a say in everything that happens there. If his wife likes to have the children around (maybe the children play much better if they have company), it is hers to decide. If he were not working from home, he would not even have noticed. He should stop to to be controlling. \"Consilting him first\"? No, really not.", "What? A baby pushing another baby could definitely lead to an emergency. Of course mom should be able to leave the room, but only if the baby is secure and not in the unmonitored presence of another child who doesn\u2019t understand anything about safety or injuries. There\u2019s enough horror stories available to understand that it only takes a few seconds for disaster to unfold, which is exactly what could\u2019ve happened here. They\u2019re lucky it didn\u2019t end badly, but it certainly could have  \u2014 all because mom was in charge of too many kids at once. OP\u2019s comment about \u201cI didn\u2019t want to deal with so many kids at once\u201d is tiptoeing asshole territory, but it seems like he\u2019s tried to bring this up before to no avail. Mom needs to learn how to say no.", "I think the term doormat is too mild for some people", "You've obviously never worked with children.  Toddlers pushing each other, biting each other, etc is absolutely normal every day stuff.  Obviously you correct the behavior but if you're getting all worked up over it, childcare is going to be a non stop anxiety fest.  Two toddlers hardly constitutes too many kids to watch.  The other kids are all older.  The baby has the same risk factors for accidents in the home without the second toddler."]}
