She can go earn herself as much as she wants.", "NTA - I'm a big fan of giving things to your family while you're alive, that way you also get to enjoy their appreciation of the gifts. In this case, your son has put work into the house (and probably expressed a desire to own it?) so you made the best of the situation in a way that benefits both you and him.\n\nOn top of that, your assessment of the division of your estate is also correct. You *might* consider leaving more cash to your daughter since your son got the benefit of a sweet deal when buying the house from you . . . but it's entirely up to you what you do with your stuff and money.", "NTA he has helped with maintenance for the past three years, lives in the house and has helped you out. \n\nYea he might have gotten a better deal than a stranger but that stranger also didn\u2019t contribute to the house.

If your other kids just want money form you, they can wait until you pass.", "NTA but your daughter is correct that generational wealth transfer is going disproportionately to your son and by extension his children. (It\u2019s not just about the total value, it\u2019s also about the time value: he is getting part of his inheritance now, whereas she is not. And $50k compounded at 8% per year for 25 years is a significant chunk of change.) If that\u2019s your intent, then that is your right.

It sounds like your daughter is just looking for free cake when you kick the bucket.", "NTA. Tell your daughter that neither she nor her children are entitled to any of your assets when you die. She should assume they will get nothing and be happy if they get anything. Your estate plan is set; if she doesn't like it, too bad.

You sold an appreciable asset for under market value to your son and plan on splitting the inheritance evenly. Which means he effectively didn\u2019t pay anything for the house.

You basically gave your son a house and told your daughter to kick rocks what did you think was going to happen?", "Your daughter is correct about how the assets will be split.  Your son gave you money for the house.  You're then going to return half of it to him in inheritance and he keeps the house at a discounted rate. Whatever the difference in value sold vs market should be given to her.  My thought is though the house will be worth a lot more than what ever is left from the sell of the house.  You did in fact take something away from her and those grandchildren.\n\nNta though, it's your stuff so do with it as you please.

You can do whatever you want with your money, but it seems like you are really unaware of how unfair your actions are if your intent is to treat your kids fairly. Your son just got a great asset for for a steal. He also was able to save money living for free. The house will continue to appreciate and he will get half the profit money from the sale back in inheritance. I have to go with YTA here because I\u2019m hoping your intent is to treat your children equally and you are not doing that.

My dad is an Ass. He stopped speaking to his mother and his brother after accusing his brother of \"whispering things in her ear\" and saying she wasn't in her right mind. She very much was in her right mind. When she passed away she split everything she had equally between her children. My father accused his brother of robbing him and their other two siblings of \"rightful\" inheritance. He demanded he be paid or myself and my sister be paid.

Seems like he is getting paid twice for the work of upkeep. First he has no rent. Second, he gets a sweet deal on the purchase price. Possibly a third benefit of buying a well maintained home.", "So your son got a free place to stay, and now he gets the house at below market value? Did you offer your daughter the same sweet gig living in your home? \n\nYou don\u2019t *owe* your daughter anything but you\u2019re being obtuse if you don\u2019t see why she would feel both hurt and shafted.", "I'm not good at math either, but what I think they're trying to say is that if you sold the house to your son (aka took money from him in exchange for the house) and then plan on splitting your assets when you die, that means your son will get the house + half of what he has paid, while your daughter only gets half of the house sale.\n\nI know that's not the only asset you would be splitting, but basically because your son now has the house, if you split your assets 50-50, it will be \"daughter got 50% of assets, son got 50% of assets plus the house and some money that he paid back\".\n\nThat being said, NTA and your daughter (though her feelings are understandable) is out of line. You're not trying to cut your daughter out of her inheritance, and I'm not sure if taking away your son's inheritance because he bought the house is the correct move. It might be best to wait until things cool off and then revisit the talk of assets and inheritance to figure out how to split it.\n\n(And before anyone says anything, I know that daughter is not entitled to OP's money but if *OP* wants to make sure it is divided fairly, then revisiting the division of assets is necessary)", "Bottom line- your house, your money, your business: anyone telling you you're an A for doing what you want with your money and property is full of it. Parents don't owe their kids an inheritance. Kids who question what their parents choose to do with \"their inheritance\" are 100% wrong. NTA", "Calculate \nA: money invested by your son in the house - the rent he did not pay  for the period he was living there. \nB: the real value of the house - selling price to your son \n\n\nA is what your son gave you. \nB is what you gave to your son.\n\nSo, did you gave your son 100k and your daughter nothing? Or was it fairish?", "You\u2019re the one asking if YTA.  You committed tax fraud.  So yes, YTA.", "If you told him you would know.  You committed tax fraud.  YTA.", "Fourth he gets half back again in inheritance.", "Not only rent free but it was only 3 years. That's not really much time to build up any equity. So son doesn't pay rent or utilities, helps out around the house, gets the house for below-market-value, and the gets half of what he gave you back (in theory) when you die. And OP is wondering why daughter is upset???", "You have to calculate the value of all the work the son did and anything he bought that went into the house too.", "It's not fraud to pay someone else to calculate your taxes for you. That's TurboTax's entire business model.", "Son was only there 3 years; how much equity and sweat work could he put in?", "It\u2019s tax fraud to withhold info on gifts given (in the form of house equity) from your tax preparer so that you don\u2019t pay gift tax.\n\nIt is immaterial if you prepared your taxes or paid someone to do it.  You did not report the gift on your taxes.  That\u2019s fraud.", "A lot depending on how much needed to be done. I've lived in a house and rehabbed the whole thing in less time, and put much more than $60,000 of work into it.", "Which I didn't do, so what are you trying to say here?"]}
