She can go earn herself as much as she wants.", "NTA - I'm a big fan of giving things to your family while you're alive, that way you also get to enjoy their appreciation of the gifts. In this case, your son has put work into the house (and probably expressed a desire to own it?) so you made the best of the situation in a way that benefits both you and him.\n\nOn top of that, your assessment of the division of your estate is also correct.

And $50k compounded at 8% per year for 25 years is a significant chunk of change.) If that\u2019s your intent, then that is your right.

You sold an appreciable asset for under market value to your son and plan on splitting the inheritance evenly. Which means he effectively didn\u2019t pay anything for the house.

You basically gave your son a house and told your daughter to kick rocks what did you think was going to happen?", "Your daughter is correct about how the assets will be split.  Your son gave you money for the house.  You're then going to return half of it to him in inheritance and he keeps the house at a discounted rate.

You did in fact take something away from her and those grandchildren.\n\nNta though, it's your stuff so do with it as you please.

Your son just got a great asset for for a steal. He also was able to save money living for free.

My dad is an Ass. He stopped speaking to his mother and his brother after accusing his brother of \"whispering things in her ear\" and saying she wasn't in her right mind. She very much was in her right mind. When she passed away she split everything she had equally between her children. My father accused his brother of robbing him and their other two siblings of \"rightful\" inheritance. He demanded he be paid or myself and my sister be paid.
