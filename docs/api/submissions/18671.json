She used the excuse of this being a cultural thing & I\u2019ve just forgotten (it\u2019s not). \nI tell her, I I may not make it due to work & the short notice. She gets mad & plays victim, saying how I\u2019m just trying to ruin her life. Refuses to introduce her soon to be husband to me even via phone. I & H managed to get leave, spend over $10k for just tickets for us 3, fly 20hrs+ each way with a toddler & surprise her 3 days b4 the wedding.

We thought this was strange but we comply. They arrive ~3.5hrs late & blamed traffic! \nJust as we were about to walk in, the MIL turns & asks us why we missed the wedding! Turns out, they had a day of celebration elsewhere with their friends & his family & we are just invited to the reception! I\u2019m angry & heartbroken for my poor parents also. My H & I leave with our toddler after escorting the bride & groom into the reception hall. No family photo as it\u2019s now too late and the reception has started.

I don\u2019t buy it. So, AITA?\n\n\nAddit: \n\nI posted this as my family thinks her age plays a big role in her actions/decisions to be a twat (not English but love that word), and I do not. They also think I am overreacting & being AH for letting this bother me for this long & therefore cutting her out of my life. \n\nA lot of you (understandably) have mentioned not having all the information/missing some vital information. I unfortunately am also missing those and do not have any more background context that can better explain my sisters actions.\nFear of judgement or criticism about her new mate from us/family, is not it as some of you speculated.\n\nCause & effect/time line points towards the now husband playing a role, but again, I just can not comfortably say he is the soul reason for it all (I don\u2019t know him at all). \n\nSome of you said, she may be ashamed of her family and purposely distancing herself, well if that\u2019s the case, fare thee well! FYI- I happen to think my family & I are a great bunch! \n\nShe has however become 1 of the few people I truly dislike.

She knew exactly what she was doing, and for some reason or another she doesn't want her birth family and her new family mixing. I feel we just don't have enough info to make a judgment as to WHY she would cut you off from her life.", "INFO : Am I reading correctly\u2026you spent over $10K and flew 20 hours to *surprise* your sister?", "NTA. Seems like she's ashamed of her family. And she definitely suckered ALOT of money out of you. She would be practically dead to me. But she will need you again.......", "NTA! This honestly sucks! I\u2019m sorry your sister treated you like this.", "NTA\n\nIf you didn\u2019t have places at the wedding because of your surprise trip, I would have somewhat understood.  That isn\u2019t what happened - you had your parents RSVP asking for extra seats for you.  They were disincluded from the wedding as well, even though they\u2019d RSVPed and confirmed their guests like normal.  You were given the change of plans on the day, too.  It wasn\u2019t like you were never promised a spot at the wedding.\n\nCombine all that with the obvious lies, and the extraordinary effort you had to put in to get there after your sister\u2019s late notice.  I can entirely understand why you are so hurt and angry.\n\nThat said, you might want to think of the possibility that your sister is in an abusive relationship.  She\u2019s gotten into this fast, with her first serious partner, without anyone from her family having a chance to meet him, and then makes some precipitous decisions at the last minute that will obviously offend her family and drive them away.\n\nThis sudden exclusion from the wedding is the kind of thing that an abuser might engineer, to cut off the outside influences in her life and make her dependent on him and his family.  Something like that happened with my sister - an ambush demand on their wedding day, which maximized the pressure on her to go along with it or lose what felt like everything in her life.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that is definitely what happened.  It\u2019s just one possibility.  I think it\u2019s one you can address without pretending everything in your relationship with her is fine, if you are so inclined.\n\nBest of luck.  I know how it feels to be the family on the opposite side of the world.  I would be devastated in your place.", "NTA.\n\nShe\u2019s 27. You\u2019re supposed to excuse her utterly rude and selfish behavior because \u201cshe\u2018s young\u201d?\n\nThat ship sailed about ten years ago.", "NTA - Your sister is a manipulative bit*ch. She guilted you into flying across the world, then disrespects you by lying about the wedding & pictures. Your parents must be heartbroken. \n\nYour sister just showed you her family means little to her. She should be asking you for forgiveness-shame on her.", "NTA but the whole thing is very... strange. In your place I wouldn't cut contact, it's sending up major red flags of abuse from her husband and his family. It was such a drastic change and the weird rescheduling even though she wanted you there- it doesn't sit right in my gut.", "NTA. Your sister needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\nShe made some terrible choices. \n\n>I\u2019ve financed all her wants & needs since young age.\n\nI think this is where her entitlement may have started.  When you give someone all their wants and needs, they feel entitled.  I could be wrong, but since she is the youngest... I have to assume she was spoiled. Maybe this is a stretch, but this is just my thoughts plus with the statement.\n\n>My family are begging me to forgive her (she hasn\u2019t apologized or asked for forgiveness) as she\u2019s just young! \n\nThis is not an excuse in my book, this is rationalising poor behaviour.\n\nI am sorry this happened to you and I am sorry that your sister is so self absorbed that she did not even want you at her wedding!", "NTA", "Definitely NTA", "NTA ...what she did was wrong, rude and uncalled for...I'm sorry she did this to you. You are wrong about how close you both are. It seems you think your closer than she does", "NTA. But don\u2019t contact with her, the way u described her says to me this is very strange behavior on her part. I am saying this as this may be a controlling husband situation. However if it seems for sure it was on your sister then don\u2019t talk to her as often and don\u2019t update her on your life.\n\nYour family excusing this behavior is bizarre, she is not young at all.

As for those reasons.... who knows. \n\nOne thing that caught my eye is OP mentioning education being a #1 priority in a partner - which is rather odd. Not kindness, personality, character, family values, or even success - just education. On it's own it's a minor thing, but it makes me wonder if there are some issues of classism/elitism or cultural expectations that the sister is trying to escape from. (OP does say that she lives in \"a better side of the world\" which was a line from the comments that made me pause.)....\n\nIf sis found a great man and he didn't meet OP's educational requirements, that may have been the reason that she didn't want to include OP in her relationship milestones.", "Yes to both.\n\nEdit: $10k just for flights and over $2k for our 1.5wk stay. 20hrs each way for flights (approx 40hrs total) with a toddler that chose to stay awake for most of the flight back.

Head counts are huge for weddings.", "Thank you for your thoughtful response. \n\nDue to the physical distance and now not speaking, I unfortunately have no way of making a proper assessment of her relationship. \nHowever, it did bother me how she suddenly became secretive and distant from the family. \nThey also moved across the world to another country approx 3 months after getting married, with just 2 weeks notice to my parents, stating she only just found out/husband surprised her! It\u2019s not actually technically possible to up and migrate to this country without months and at times years of visa process that she would most definitely be aware of & involved in. \nShe is a very smart, well educated woman and someone that has a very strong support system.

However, her sudden behavioral change (becoming secretive about everything, him being off topic from the moment they met - which isn\u2019t normal in our family), did raise questions for me and the family. We just have no way of knowing since she becomes very defensive and aggressive at the idea of something being wrong. The family put it down to her being young and protective of her relationship.", "I am the oldest, live in a better side of the world and I started working at a young age.

She started distancing herself from you muuuuch earlier, where she's been dating for 2 years and you've only been introduced to the guy months before the wedding. Your family not being anywhere close to the wedding was the plan from the very start. She was NOT pleasantly surprised that you've managed to come, she just had to play that role, likewise, she was hoping that you guys would leave and not come to the reception.", "I am getting a religious crazy vibe from this.", "Honestly, sounds like drug use to me.  My ex used to mumble excuses like that.", "You and I read her education comment very differently as I saw it as OP and sister saw education as #1 priority for THEMSELVES, not for their partners.", "I read that as getting an education was a priority for OP and sister before dating/getting married, not that education was a priority in their mate.", "I told my parents from the moment I knew I could make it.

WHY she wants to run away is the question.", "I\u2019m assuming your sister is the way she is because your parents never actually parented.

She sound like she needs a come to Jesus moment, badly.", "Honestly it doesn\u2019t sound like abuse to me. It sounds like your sister may have been lying to her new in-laws and possibly her husband. About what? I don\u2019t know, could be just \u201cpadding the resume\u201d type stuff or she may have made up a whole life\u2019s story, but it really seems like she\u2019s desperate to make sure there isn\u2019t much time for the two sides to talk.", "_\"Better side of the world\"_\n\n_\"Education was #1 priority\"_\n\nINFO: OP, has your sister ever indicated any issues of feeling judged by you or her family?

For some reason your sister didn't want you at her wedding at all.", "INFO because I\u2019m getting a \u201cmissing missing reasons\u201d vibe here.

There was nothing that was going on that was \u2018toxic\u2019 as far as the family is involved. We were all shocked by all of it but my family are obviously more forgiving than I am. \nAs for moving across the other side of the world, it\u2019s not uncommon to take the opportunity to move to a developed country when you reside in a developing country.

They just are. Your sister is doing what she wants to. She knows what she did was evil 'cause she doesn't mention the deliberate deception about the ceremony when defending your absence.

Wanna bet that she has deceived his family too? \n\nThis whole thing smells of con-artist to me, even if he is manipulating her. She is a willing dupe or the mastermind.", "I m getting shame vibes.. as tho she is either ashamed of something about her family or ashamed of something about her husband.

My parents worship the ground she walks on and she knows I\u2019d never turn her away if she ever reached out with legitimate need for help.", "She's lying about everything. Wedding, moving, no idea why. Stay NC until she apologizes to you genuinely. She must be ashamed of you all or something. Or she married for a visa? Green card? She's just being super awful and suspicious. NTA How do you think she'd react if you show her and your family this post?", "I am really hoping she did not marry for any other reason but for love/true desire for companionship with this person. In saying that, he did move to a developed country to do his post doc (post PhD) just before or as they started dating and they have now moved to that country (the move is seen as great opportunity where we are from).
