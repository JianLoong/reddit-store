I\u2019d be upset in your place too, but the neighbors really haven\u2019t done anything wrong, or anything at all.\n\nYou have decided to make this a thing between you and them. You just have an apartment with thin walls, and your neighbors have a difficult baby.", "i mean you changed your complete cycle because you hear her kid every night. i dont know what more compassion you are able to give. and that you only own a motorcycle, well it is what it is. if your arent going louder than you really have to on your way out and back i dont see any problem. NTA", "Esh when you say loud bike purposely modified to be loud is my question if your firing up.a straight pipes Harley at 4am yta", "INFO: How do you pick up your in inclement weather?", "Could you wheel the bike down the street away before starting it?", "I live on a cul de sac and I have a neighbor with an extremely loud car. They start their car between 4:30 and 5:15 every morning, and it doesn\u2019t always start on the first try. Since we\u2019re at the end of a cul de sac their driveway is very close to my bedroom window. I am extremely frustrated being woken up most days, but I know there\u2019s nothing I can say because they\u2019re going to work. If I knew there was an option, I would be pretty pissed.", "I had a neighbor that had a loud ass motorcycle in an apartment complex. That thing was setting off my car alarm every morning.\n\n\nWe had a reasonable conversation and wouldn't you know it, we found a way to be reasonable about things.", "I think he\u2019s accepted it pretty well. He never bothered his neighbor about it and never mentioned it to her. She on the other hand, is complaining about it and throwing a fit. NTA", "Personally, earplugs give me a headache after a bit. A noise machine only blocks out so much. A screaming baby is gonna make it through apartment walls", "He's not the AH though, because he offered to buy the neighbors ear plugs.  Lol", "I dunno, fuck people who have loud babies. Some people enjoy having a child, some having a loud motorcycle. Bikes engines and exhaust are naturally quite loud. Why does anyone's chosen joy take precedence over others? Why is someone an asshole if they work a night shift and ride a loud bike, or their partner for that matter. You rely on night workers for medicine, police, fire etc. This is condensed living. Children are a choice.", "So I'm not the only one who noticed.", "Never mind! I misread everything. Time to go to bed!\n\nI don't get the shift in sleeping hours. OP started going to sleep at 2am instead of earlier so that the baby would be done crying, but then states he picks up the GF at 4am--so a two hour nap before getting her and then back to sleep? And did I read that OP works just 2-4 hours a week?", "I\u2019m up at that time cause of the child I just decided to do something mf productive with my time if I was gonna be awake. Earplugs don\u2019t work for me as my circadian rhythm is shot to all hell and I can\u2019t wake up at a set time without a sound", "I tried earplugs but it\u2019s a lot easier to tune out traffic sounds than it is to tune out a child crying loudly at intervals in the night", "Do you really think noise laws apply to babies?", "Well, OP did say they got ear plugs for the other neighbors.", "Yup. The really loud motorcycles that do revs trigger my nervous system and I will literally jump and put my hands over my ears when one goes past when I am walking down the street.", "I have a truck that the previous owner put on a custom exhaust and while I do think it sounds good, I also think it can be too loud and wish it was one of the fancier new ones that some cars have with valves inside so you can have it quiet when you want to (like starting up early in the morning)", "Because his motorcycle isn't 'somewhat loud', it is extremely loud.  And there are plenty of motorcycles that are much much quieter.", "So the kid didn't make you change your sleep schedule,  your girlfriends new job did.", "Yeah right? I know I burned down their house, but I bought them a lawn gnome!", "So you're doing something completely unnecessary, disruptive and shitty and driving past probably thousands of people unnecessarily loudly at that time of the morning all because... you happen to be awake. \n\nI thought there might at least be a good reason for picking the girlfriend up and there isn't, you're just attempting to be an even bigger asshole.", "The loud bike was a choice. An asshole choice. Babies grow up and sleep through the night, a loud motorcycle/car is always loud.", "Uhmm... because babies become doctors, engineers, miners, workers etc. in 20-30 years. We need those more than a mode of transportation that objectively has safer and quieter alternatives.\n\nThere have been no alternatives to babies so far.", "Not all motorcycles are louder than a cars, but late at night everything sounds louder, even cars and skateboards.", "Het sleeps in the afternoon, OP said 2pm", "In another comment they say that it's some kind of Ducati worth 23k.", "So instead of just wearing earplugs yourself to sleep, you buy them for multiple neighbors?", "So you expect her to set an alarm to wake up and put earplugs in every night for you? Maybe you\u2019ve never had a kid or helped raise younger siblings, but you have to be able to hear everything going on in the house at all times if you\u2019re not physically with them. Also firing up a loud motorcycle during times that most cities have noise ordinance isn\u2019t \u201croad traffic\u201d.\n\nSouth Park made an episode about you", "Yeah, I was wondering why Op didn't already do this. While they obviously wanna bother their upstairs neighbour a little bit (fair, I suppose?), they have more than one neighbour. \n\nBack in the day we'd push our bike quietly down THREE streets to the nearest 'loud' road before VRRRing off if we wanted to ride in the middle of the night. I'd rather ride straight into a wall than bother innocent sleeping people.", "If you ever find out, will you let me know because I like near a fairly busy residential road, and there's some asshole with a particularly loud crotchrocket who likes to rev the shit out of it while flying down the road at about 60 mph at random times of the day and night. It's so stupid and I honestly really dislike them for it.", "Thats very different", "Looool. Talk about whoosh. \n\nWhat is the point or purpose of life?\n\nThe joys we experience, our capability to experience them, they impart the value onto our lives. \n\nThat we value our lives beyond mere survival instinct to do things that bring joy, goes on to impart value on all of those careers and skills you mentioned. They prolong and improve our lives. However, those things that bring joy are still the pinnacle of importance. A prolonged life without joy is just... meaningless. \n\nTo ride a motorcycle may be someone's joy. To raise a child another. Both could be, at different times or the same. My point is, the things we do for joy, should not be diminished in their importance by others. You don't want to hear a loud bike at 4am, then live where there aren't 24hr services, live in quiet detached neighborhoods. Otherwise, the advantages and cost savings of condensed living come at a cost. The hypothetical life someone goes on to live cannot by definition out value the joys of another's life, due to the fact that joy itself imparts all value onto life. Without joy, it is just nihilistic existence.\n\nIf you disagree to my main caveat that joy imparts all meaning to life, then we may as well just not even discuss further because we will not see eye to eye ever.", "As far as motorbikes go ducatis aren't very loud.", "OPs behaviour is mean and petty, not \u2018fair\u2019.", "I know some of that is so cars hear them since they can be missed easily. Not defending, it annoys me, as well, but I see a purpose", "Omg, go to Myrtle Beach. They constantly drive down the strip engines revving and music blasting, all day and all night", "Yeah, I will. Because I\u2019m not being obtuse, I\u2019m genuinely curious.", "True, but with children it\u2019s not an active choice between a louder or a quieter model", "may I direct you to google search of \"sarcasm\"", "Yeah, I know, that's why I mentioned them in my comment.  I just wish the cops would enforce them against motorcycles.", "If the joy someone gets from riding a motorcycle comes from the volume of it, yeah that makes them an asshole. Enjoy the ride without ruining my day with how loud that shit is.", "Yeah, motorcycles have a lot smaller engines than cars usually, but their exhausts are also way smaller. If you look at the size of a typical car muffler to a motorcycle it's not even close. I have an objectively very loud motorcycle with the same size or bigger engine than many cars, there's only so much you can do to make it quiet, and of course the previous owner put on a louder exhaust. I'm lucky that in neighborhoods I can actually keep the RPMs down enough that it's actually not too loud cause I can basically idle it around, but some people (Especially Harley guys) tend to have painfully loud exhausts.", "They have them from the factory, just a lot of Harley owners remove them.", "The guy spent over 20k on his bike.", "Yeah a ducati doesn't make that better, nor does reving it up to 14000rpm, which you're doing deliberately and deliberately creating a louder noise than necessary at 4am.\n\nGrow up, sell the bike and get a car like other reasonable people, it will also probably save your life.", "I have a neighbor with a motorcycle and it is super annoying. I would never complain about it to them, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have an issue. I just don\u2019t want to argue with my neighbors.", "That's why I begrudgingly supposed instead of endorsed his behaviour. In british nuance that sentence would read more like *\"ugh, fine, I guess.\"*", "However it doesn't help most of the time.\n\nhttps://www.spauldinginjurylaw.com/blog/loud-pipes-saves-lives-myth/#:~:text=Being%20that%20I%20am%20a,and%20the%20reason%20is%20interesting.\n\nhttps://www.autoweek.com/news/industry-news/a35952569/loud-pipes-do-not-save-lives/", "Yeah, this is why my stepdad made his louder, too many cars don\u2019t pay attention.", "As a car driver, I call BS on this.", "Oh gross", "You know what really helps?   High visibility colors.\n\nBut then you can't be cool, in your black leathers, on a black bike, on a gray road.", "I agree and half the time you can't work out exactly where it's coming from if the roads are a little busy.  It could be behind you, in front of you or on another road coming up to yours.\n\nVery similar to the sirens on an emergency vehicle.  I simply cannot tell where it is until I see the flashing lights but I've just spent 30 seconds all over the road (with my eyes) trying to work out whether I need to move over or or it's actually coming towards me.", "Motorcycles get tboned or end up tboning cars al the time because the driver of the car had a stop sign/light and didn't register the bike coming. This is despite perfectly legal and adequate lane positioning etc. It is never a bad idea to put an extra layer between somebody and death, especially when the consequences boil down to somebody frowning because they have to hear a noise", "Sure take steps that don't impact/bother other people. Like helmet, pads, other protective equipment.\n\n But if you are going to use \"safety\" equipment that are a nuisance to others it is a bit hypocritical to cite safety as a reason for doing that when your are doing an inherently dangerous thing. \n\nIf you are engaging in a dangerous activity you should take responsibility and not bother other people with it. \n\nA comparable situation would be like a smoker not wanting to smoke inside their apartment (safety to avoid 2nd/3rd hand smoke) so they go into the stairwell/lobby of the building and let the smoke buildup bother other people.", "My aunt and uncle have loved their motorcycles for years too. My aunt can NOW walk again after 2 years. It took 20 years, but they both were hit and it was devastating. And the crash gear I guess helped them not die. My 21 year old childhood friend was not so lucky. Left behind a pregnant fiance. But yeah, the wind in your helmet must be totally worth it", "You are purposefully choosing a hobby that negatively impacts the lives of those around you and causes noise and air pollution. Cars are already bad enough but motorcycle are even louder and people drive them just for fun. So while I don't care about your safety don't use it as an excuse to be even louder.", "Yeah we all take calculated risks in life I value being able to ride a motorcycle enough to accept the risk that I might crash one day. The same way a smoker is willing to risk getting lung cancer to smoke. You have things your willing to risk your life for so do we I don\u2019t see the point in judging other peoples choices. Most people judging motorcyclist for being stupid are just trying to mask their insecurities if you don\u2019t wanna risk it don\u2019t but stop acting like we\u2019re crazy for doing it.", "Nobody forced you to be an asshole either.  You chose that.", "> I told her that I have offered to previously buy her some earplugs so that she wouldn't have to be bothered by the sound like i did for my other neighbours.\n\nSo your chosen motorcycle is so loud that your neighbors all need earplugs even though its going through brick walls and soundproofed windows!? My wife can start and ride off in her 790 Duke without waking me up with the windows open."]}
