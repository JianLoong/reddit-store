That's your first problem", "YTA. People who drive loud motorcycles don't seem to understand just how loud and obnoxious they are.\nWe ought to be quiet at night. Bikes aren't quiet so they ought not to be turned on and driven about at night. Chances are your neighbour isn't the only neighbour bothered about this.\nI don't have kids, but I can at least understand that you can't control a baby crying, so I don't think these are equal grievances that can be used to cancel each other out.", "The reason for your schedule change isn\u2019t really relevant since you say it works out better for you anyway. \n\nCan you start the motorcycle further away?

Would you be up doing this to all your neighbors at 4 am no matter what, since you have to pick up your girlfriend?

Also even if you want to spite the young mother and her child for God knows what reason you are waking up a lot more people than her with your motorcycle.\n\nAnyone who drives a loud motorcycle is basically an asshole anyway. Nobody thinks you guys are cool when you drive by everybody is just annoyed.", "YTA because she doesn't have control on a baby like that. My first and last were as quiet as a mouse.

Tell your neighbor you will keep that noise down when she starts keeping the noise down from her apartment.", "YTA\n\nPark your bike down the street if possible. Its a loud bike by your own admission. \n\nI question why you decided to change your sleep schedule rather than address the issue. Surely you'd rather have a normal sleep schedule that allows you to be awake during the day?\n\nYou could've taken the advice you gave and invested in ear plugs?", "Nta", "YTA. You are being retaliatory bc a baby cried\u2026which is normal sounds for an apartment.", "INFO: Is your exhaust AM?\nHave you removed the baffle? \n\nWithout INFO: ESH", "NTA - Mostly.  \n\n\nYou had to change your schedule because of her child.  That's not your fault.  \n\n\nThat being said, if your motorcycle is loud enough to wake someone, get it mufflered so iit is as quiet as a normal car.
