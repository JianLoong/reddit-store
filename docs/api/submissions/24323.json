This means that no one has a dedicated parking spot so basically you end up parking wherever you find a free spot. I have an SUV so it can be challenging parking in tight spots and normally when I get home late, I opt to leave the car on the street so that I don't block other neighbors. We also have come to an agreement that all of us should leave our phone numbers written on a piece of paper and visible if someone needs to contact us regarding our car. \n\nYesterday I came back from work and parked my car on a suitable spot. My car was the only one on that lane, so there were other free spots to my left and right. Around 9 PM I got a call to go to the parking space to move my car bc I was blocking the access to the car next to me. Mind you, I knew for a fact that I parked on one single spot and the car was centered but I went down anyways to see what was happening. \n\nTwo of my neighbors were waiting for me there and the mother was holding their baby in a baby car seat. Their car, also an SUV was parked near me. (Quick mention: these people are really rude to all of us, we had situations with them in the past and everybody in the building knows them for being very rude and difficult.) I looked at both cars and saw that I was not blocking them, any of us could have easily got into either of the cars, not fully opening the door because parking spaces, but enough for any person to access their vehicle. I told them this and asked what the problem was. The entitled dad demanded in a rude tone that I move my car because they needed to fully open the back door to load the baby car seat. Here is where I may have been an AH, I got annoyed by the attitude and told them to get the car out from the parking spot and then load whatever they needed to. Entitled mom told me in a very annoying voice \"but we have a babyyyy with us!\" to which I replied that I don't care and went back upstairs.\n\nTo me the situation was really pathetic but hubby says that I could have been nicer to them. so AITA?", "created_utc": 1691674328, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ncnmm/aita_for_refusing_to_move_my_car_for_my_neighbors/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good grief, entitled people!", "NTA you were parked properly and there was apparently plenty of spots on either side, it's not your fault they parked right next to you. Poor planning on their part does not constitute an emergancy on your part", "NTA - Just as you said, he could back up while she waited outside the vehicle with the baby. Pretty entitled to call someone to come move their car when they could easily resolve the issue themselves. On top of that, they had a shitty attitude about it. \n\nHaving a kid is their issue and no one elses. It's not a medical condition, it's a choice.", "NTA You parked appropriately, and in the amount of time it took to call you and wait for you to come down, they could have simply just backed the car out a bit if tey needed more space to get the car seat in", "NTA. They can park elsewhere or pull out of the spot much easier and faster than calling someone and waiting.", "NTA\n\nI'd question if they're stupid, lazy or just entitled.\n\nI'm gonna guess entitled.", "NTA. There were two adults there with one baby. They could have solved their own problem in 10 seconds or less by pulling the vehicle out of the spot.", "NTA. They're being absurd. You did jyst fine.", "NTA. They sound like the type of people who'll wait 10 minutes for a close parking spot at Target rather than parking in the open spot three spots down and walking an extra minute.", "NTA. You literally parked normally and are always careful with where you put the car. They sound disgustingly entitled", "NTA\n\nIt's a very strange request from them. If there was only one adult I could understand them not wanting to put the baby sit down to get the car out so that they could put the kid in. Still they needed to ask, not demand.\n\nBut there were two adults. One could stay with the kid while the other took their car out. WTF", "NTA. At 9 pm they actually called you to come outside for\u2026.nothing.   Had you acquiesced, they would do this all the time. They had viable alternatives\u2026pull the car out a little, or one holds the door open as far as it can while the other gets in with car seat (since it sounds like only issue was couldn\u2019t open all the way, but that may not even be necessary to get in)", "NTA. Their poor planning is not your fault. You mentioned that your SUV was the only one there when you got home, so you technically were there first. Idk if there was any other car there, but if not, they could've parked somewhere else (if the lot was empty)", "NTA I couldn\u2019t imagine having the entitlement to call my neighbor and demand they move their car when mine is 100% accessible/movable.", "No, they could have backed their wretched SUV out and loaded up the babyyyy. It\u2019s sitting in a parking lot, not a busy street. It\u2019s not that difficult. NTA", "NTA. They had options, they chose not to be resourceful and problem solve by themselves so you handed their problem back to them to do the thing they should have done in the first place. The world does not revolve around what fell out of her vag", "NTA. They abused the arrangement you and your neighbors made by calling you out for a silly reason. They had an SUV. Car seat could easily have gone in through the back. Fuck em.", "NTA. I get that they have to open the door fully to get the baby in the car (I have what sounds like a similar carrier), but they should never have called you to move your car. It literally makes no sense. Move your car so we can open our door so that then we can move our car? No. Just back the car up a little and open the door fully for the carrier. \n\nThe only way I would feel differently is if a second parent wasn\u2019t around to hold the carrier while the first parent pulled the car out.", "NTA. You had it pegged: they could have backed out of the parking space themselves and had all the space they needed to load anything they needed and not bother anyone. Instead, they wanted to bother someone else to get them to move their car and then wait around until they did whatever they did what they wanted to do. \n\nAnd just because they have a baby dies not give them the right to make any demand they want to their neighbors.", "NTA.\n\nBoth adults were there. One can hold the baby carrier while the other moves the car. Its common sense. As you said, they're just entitled.", "NTA. I would've gotten angry. This is what you interrupt my evening for?", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nThat\u2019s a very plausible idea, one I\u2019ve done myself plenty of times. It takes one person to move the car enough for the other one person to load the kid. They gotta figure out how to do shit while carting the baby places, world ain\u2019t gonna cater to you (am a parent and figured this kinda shit out instead of acting entitled)", "NTA. They are two adults- one can pull the car out and the other can load the baby then\u2026 we\u2019ve done that.", "Nta but if they are bad neighbors. Just wait for your car to be keyed.

More entitled parents!!!!!", "NTA\n\nBut this does remind me of a time back at university\u2026\n\nParking was tight. Dirt lot, so no lines. Made even tighter by people who chose to park so they could get in to their (usually trucks) with ridiculous ease. I had a hatchback Vega. And it was a beater so I didn\u2019t really care about retribution.\n\nI would pop the hatch, park, leaving mere inches on either side, and get out the back. Yep, I was \u201cthat asshole\u201d. \n\nNow I\u2019m not going to say I influenced peoples parking choices but it did seem to me people started being a bit more courteous. \n\nYour neighbors could have easily solved their own problem. But it took YOU to help them see the error of their ways.\n\nGood job.", "Honestly, ETA for having suvs in the first place.", "NTA - there were two adults. One could hold the baby while one moved the car so they had room to put the car seat in. If it was just one adult alone, then yes it would have been good to move the car. In this instance, it wasn\u2019t needed.\n\nI will say though, you may be in for some door dings and scratches because I guarantee they\u2019ll be flinging doors open and letting diaper bags scrape against your car getting in and out now. These people sound like they\u2019re the kind to hold a grudge.", "Unrelated to this post because there were two adults but I am curious, how do you solve this problem if you are by yourself?", "Entitled yes. But I wouldn\u2019t discount lazy and stupid.", "I'd say all of the above", "So, one parent pulls the car out of the spot while the other parent is holding the baby. Once the car is out of the spot, the parent holding the baby puts the baby in the car and then hops into their seat and off they go. Easy peasy.", "And they couldn't do this by moving their car a little? All they had to do and what they eventually did was: husband moved their car out of the parking spot, opened the door and loaded the car seat. It was that simple...", "Yeah, true. But is it reasonable to call a neighbor at 9pm to come outside to move their car so they could open their door all the way? Or simply back up a bit and load the baby?\n\nI don't think so. These people *are* rude and entitled. They could have at least asked nicely since they had the audacity to call their neighbor outside!", "When I'm by myself with the baby, I'm really cognizant of that, so I park where one of the sizes is by a curb or a handicap area (not park IN the handicap area, but next to one where there's more space). \n\nThat said, if I was by myself and HAD to get out, then I would be willing to contact a neighbor, but I would also be apologetic and grateful.", "Depending on the car loading through the trunk space. When my oldest was little and that wasn't an option for the car we had I left the infant carrier in the car. With my youngest we went straight to a convertible car seat but it's another reason for the wonderful sliding doors of a minivan.", "I vote not lazy because it's harder to call a neighbour and wait. Just stupid and entitled.", "What if there\u2019s only one person?  I saw on the news recently a kid got ran over while on their car seat outside the vehicle", "ESH, what if it was just one of them with the baby?", "Confirmed. This is a problem that almost every parent has faced and solved without needing to make a phone call.", "Yes! And at the grocery store I parked way back near the closest cart return. Haul that super heavy baby carrier into the car and a quick walk to the cart corral. I still do that even though my kids are way past that stage.", "I found it was difficult but possible to get the carseat in and out when I could open the door wide enough for an adult to get in and out comfortably. Obviously if an adult would have to squeeze in then a carseat won't fit. It's also tricky but not impossible to load it from the opposite side. So unless you're in squeezing room only on both sides, it's doable.", "Then you park somewhere else to begin with. Either way, that wasn't the case. BOTH parents were there. This was easily remedied without bothering someone else.", "But there wasn't so your point is moot. The entitled pests could have moved the car back enough to put the kid in and then leave without bothering the OP", "I agree that calling OP at 9 pm is shitty"]}
