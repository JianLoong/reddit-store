Apologize, and ask for the house tour to learn the rules.", "YTA, it's an honest mistake, but it is your mistake and therefore you should apologize.", "YTA and you know it. You owe them an apology for the initial mistake and a second one for not apology right away for damaging their stuff.", "YTA.\n\nYou should always check what's in the oven before cooking, especially if it's in a home you are unfamiliar with. A lesson for the future. \n\nI understand your reluctance to apologise because she yelled and insulted you on the phone, which was not the right thing to do, but her anger was justified.

You should apologize because you messed up and they\u2019re right to be annoyed because you could have ruined their expensive appliance. You already know this and it\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re a 17 year old since you have any reservations regarding apologizing when you obviously should. You need to grow up", "YTA. You are a guest in their home, the least you can do is try to not destroy it. And if you do, you need to apologize.", "YTA - You should absolutely apologise for the damage you caused. I suspect the mom is only being so intense about it because of your attitude to the whole thing, claiming it's not your fault and they they are wrong for storing things.\n\nI don't store things in my over but still check inside to see if the right rack is inside or not, so I don't have to change them once it's already hot. Most people do look inside or just notice things when the light turns on, even if there shouldn't be anything in it.\n\nI get it, you're still a kid, but at 17 I'd been using an oven for years and you should have some idea of how it works. Unfortunately, you hadn't already learned that, and learned it the hard way under suboptimal conditions, so I understand a bit, but the blame is on you, and you should apologise.", "YTA\n\nShe was a but much about it sure, but all you have to do is apologise. It's this woman's home and property. Presumably is her letting you live there.", "YTA. You caused this issue, even if it was an accident. Just apologize.\n\nWhy are you living with your girlfriend and her parents?", "YTA, even though you're a kid and didn't know any better. A kid knows to apologize for kid mistakes.", "YTA, it sounds like this is the only living option you have at the moment and you're fucking it up. Accidents happen that does mean you don't have to apologise. You damaged something, grow up and apologise.", "YTA. You melted a dish and damaged their oven. You own them an apology.\n\nYou are living in their home - when you move into someone else's home you need to recognise that their house rules, and the ways things are done, are different to what you are used to,.\n\nI agree that storing plastics in the oven isn't the greatest idea in the world but you knew it was all new, it would have been sensible to double check , and to have checked the moment it started to smoke or you smelled something odd.\n\nBut you definitely need to apologise. Even if it was an accident, it was caused by your actions and it caused damage to their property, both things which mean you should apologise. Whether her mum ought also to apologise for having yelled at you is a separate issue but your apology is due anyway, and needs to come first. Part of becoming an adult is taking responsibility for your own actions and their consequences, even whre the consequences were not intended.", "YTA. You are living in your girlfriends parents home and you fucked up their oven. Why exactly do you think you don't have to apologize? You ruined a plastic trey and fucked up their oven. You. You did that. Apologize before they come to their senses about letting the teen boyfriend move in.", "YTA, you damaged their property so you should definitely apologize. Checking if the oven is empty takes only a few seconds.", "YTA.\n\nYou made a mistake, you own it you apologize.\n\nIt's always good practice to check oven if it's empty before turning it on. It's not something terrible but it's your mistake that you did and the relationship between you and your gf parents won't get any better if you will be fighting them when you are in the wrong.", "YTA. \n\nI gotta ask, why are you living at your GF\u2019s parents house at 17? That\u2019s already a bad look, I completely understand why they\u2019re not exactly in love with you. I can only imagine they\u2019re doing you a favor by getting you out of a bad situation.", "YTA. You check the oven before you pre-heat. It also blows my mind that you didn't think to check the oven when it started smoking but immediately phoned someone that wasn't there to assist. \n\nApologise and replace the melted items.", "YTA. It was an easy mistake to make, though personally, I do think it should be second nature to check the oven before you pre-heat. What if the shelves weren't in there? \n\nIf you want to keep living there you're going to need to start taking responsibility. Apologise for the accident and offer to buy replacement trays.", "YTA\n\nSo you destroyed a brand new kitchen gadget without even apologizing?\n\nI guess, when I cause a car crash and total your car I don't have to apologize and pay for it because it was a simple mistake?", "YTA in every conceivable way OP. Couple years ago, my aunt was staying with us for a few months. Her dumb*ss put pizza boxes into the oven one night. The next day she went to make her self some lunch. Preheats the oven. Continues to cook 4 pizza boxes and catches our stove and half the kitchen on fire, fills the whole house in smoke. Its not an \"simple mistake\". If something flammable was in that oven, you could have burnt their house down. Take responsibility for your actions and for God's sake, be smart enough to make sure nothing is in the oven", "You just said it...mistake. what do you do when people make mistakes? \n\nWhat do you expect people to do when they make a mistake TOWARDS you?\n\nYeah....", "yta\u2026 it ain\u2019t ur house so obviously things might be different you could\u2019ve asked and avoided this.", "YTA. You almost broke their new oven and burned some of their stuff. It may have been an accident but if the accident is your fault (which it very much is) you should still apologize.", "YTA. I doubt you have any concept of the expense and time that goes into getting new kitchen appliances because you are a kid, but it\u2019s a major upgrade. I would be seriously upset if someone ruined a brand new oven due to carelessness, especially someone who is not part of the family and really has no business even turning on the oven. And you won\u2019t even apologize?? \n\nApologize. Offer to pay for a replacement oven, even if it may take you years to pay it off. If you have any other living options at all, move out of your girlfriend\u2019s family\u2019s home.", "YTA...man up and apologize to her.  She had a reason to be upset. You should have led with an apology before telling her what you did.  Your lack of experience or her attitude isn't relevant to the fact that you almost trashed their new oven, set fire to their house, and filled the place with toxic fumes.", "YTA. Yeah, I kinda think you should apologize. Though it's not normal to store things in an oven, it's their household and their rules and you need the learn to live with them and respect them. Of course she overreacted, but that does not absolve you from your mistake, no matter your good intentions. I would apologize and maybe buy a new plastic thing that melted, idk. I'm not sure what arrangement you have, but since they let you live under their roof you could be more careful until you learn all their rules.", "Why move into a house hold when you don\u2019t get along with the people living there.\nYTA, you should also check the washing machine etc. before staring in. But the mother in law also an ahole", "YTA", "You mess it up, your break it, you lose it, you fucking APOLOGIZE! You're immature and you cannot even handle big boy pants enough to own up to mistakes. Sure, having people yelling and cursing at you is shit and no one likes these kind of situations, but you, you put this on a level that's just unnecessary and petty. YTA and you know it", "YTA. It was a mistake, but you are way beyond old enough to know to apologize in this situation. Remember, they don\u2019t have to let you be there.

This doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s going to go well, and you will be the one to get the boot when things go downhill.", "Yes. You knew they didn't like you, and I'm sorry you were never taught to check the oven before turning it on. So why are you living there?", "Sort of YTA, obviously most people don\u2019t store things in the oven so it\u2019s understandable you didn\u2019t check. But you should still apologize and say it was a mistake\n\nEdit to add: okay I see the comments saying people do this but the intended purpose of an oven is not for storage. I don\u2019t blame him for making that mistake because the oven is literally meant for cooking not storing.", "Info: how come you\u2019re not living with your own parents?", "the epitome of being an entitled teenager. YTA. apologize or expect your gfs parents tell you to live somewhere else.", "Yta.\n\nYour fault. Apologise.\nFind some common sense and manners", "YTA - I have done this. Luckily, it was a pizza stone and not plastic. It is an easy mistake to make. However, you still damaged their oven and melted their plastic, and you should have apologized. It sounds like maybe you guys don't get along because you're not showing them respect and that's not fair considering they are allowing you to live in their home.", "ESH\n\nI don't blame them for being annoyed. Calling you stupid is unnecessary though.\n\nI don't blame you for not checking as not everyone does this. ( I DONT)\n\nYou should apologize you broke their property. Doesn't make it not your fault because you didn't mean to.", "YTA You made a mistake and it wasn\u2019t on purpose, but you should absolutely apologize. Having hurt feelings because someone yelled at you doesn\u2019t make your feelings right. You messed up and she\u2019s right to be upset. You should try to work on not feeling like the victim if someone is mad at you - it makes dealing with other people a lot easier.", "YTA\n\nYou admit to the mistake here, but refuse to own up and apologize to make things right?  What is wrong with you?", "I don't get why people store things in the oven either... I would also just turn it on to pre-heat without checking.

You should apologize for the damage caused, yes. Whether or not it was intentional, you did still cause damage.

I had a bad home life and moved in with my boyfriend and his parents. They did everything so differently than I did, and they were also closed-minded and thought I was doing everything wrong. I could not do anything right in their house, but I didn't make anything better with my attitude at the time. \n\nI'm gonna say your gf's mom sucks for yelling at you in this situation, but honestly you suck too for not apologizing for melting a lid inside her oven and not offering to help clean it up. Sometimes you have to keep the peace, even if you think you're right. \n\nIt really is dumb to store non-oven safe items in the oven, though.
