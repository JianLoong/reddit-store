Old enough to join a police force and arrest people.  Old enough to vote.  Old enough to join the army, visit strange lands, meet new people (and shoot them!).  Old enough to have kids of your own without it being weird. Old enough to sign contracts (and have them be binding).  Old enough to marry without parental permission.   Old enough ... OK fine, you get the idea.  (But NOT old enough to have a beer, if in the US, which I'm 99% certain you are... Ahh never change, America!)\n\nNTA dear lord!!", "NTA. You\u2019re 19. You deserve your privacy.", "Either your mom is the worst kind of helicopter parent or just plain old controlling and entitled to your private life. NTA in any case.", "NTA\nWTF. Maybe nobody told you so far, but it's not normal to share chat conversations with your family. My family restricted our Internet time or the access to some devices. And we always had to tell, which persons we meet and we were not allowed to meet strangers. But they never read our conversations. And with 19 you are an adult and you need your privacy.", "It\u2019s time for you to not share your passwords. Time to be independent. If your mum wants to know things she can ask you instead of going through your messages.", "NTA. Change your passwords and DO NOT GIVE THEM TO YOUR MOTHER OR ANYONE ELSE! Your mother has NO right to check your accounts. Cut her out. You're an adult. Act like it.", "Nta, but dont give her your passwords...", "NTA and that\u2019s weird. You don\u2019t have autonomy and that\u2019s what you need. Your mother is controlling you she should not be. Stop sharing your password with her. If she respects you she\u2019ll respect that.", "NTA. It's time to disconnect the umbilical cord from Mommy dearest. At the very least find a form of communication that she does not have access to while you gain independence elsewhere.", "NTA\n\nYour mom *is* a bad mother for wanting to have access to all her adult daughter\u2019s personal communications. That is completely outrageous and unreasonable. She should no longer be your line of defence and protection against the world (in fact, I think having access to email and social media would be weird from age 14 onwards, maybe younger).\n\nHer trampling all over your privacy and autonomy is a abusive and invasive thing to do. It is controlling and over-bearing. It is not in your best interests.\n\nAt best, this might indicate your mother has serious anxiety problems about a dangerous world she wants to protect you from. At worst, she genuinely does not respect you as an adult and wants to have complete control over who you talk to and what you say (and I think this latter option is more likely). With all your passwords, what is to stop her ruining your credit, spending your money, trapping you at home under her control forever?\n\nDo you have a driver\u2019s license and your own bank account? (To which she does not have the passwords?). If not, get them.\n\nChange your password to everything and do not give them to your mother. Get all your documents (birth certificate, passport, etc) and lock them somewhere she cannot access them. \n\nHonestly, this is incredibly weird, and alarming, and she should not have passwords to anything.", "NTA: why does she have your password? Is she paying for your account? I didn\u2019t do this to my child when she was 13. She even friended me on fb because she trusted me. Change your password and be an adult.", "If not now, when? At what age does she think you can be independent? It's a password to what .. a social media account or something? If you want her to have a particular password for some reason, then that's your decision. But I'm fine with you managing your own accounts. They're yours after all; not hers. It can be tough to 'let go' as our children get older. But some parents take it too far. It's time for you to change any and all passwords and let your mom know that you appreciate her oversight and help in recent years but that you're now of an age that you will be managing your own online accounts entirely. The talk won't be easy (especially for her) but I think it needs to happen.", "NTA change your password and do t give it to anyone. You\u2019re 19 and you mom reads your conversations. What is going on here, sounds like she\u2019s either controlling or not wanting you to grow up.", "You are 19. Nineteen!\n\nWhy are you giving in to her controlling behaviour????\n\nChange your password again and don't give it to her. \n\nThat she thinks it's appropriate to have access to your private and personal conversations is bizarre.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I.e. is this direct access or remote?\n\nIf it\u2019s remote access, cut her off, but include her fingerprint or face for safety reasons (I.e. if you\u2019re in an accident, not everyday).

That is invasive and beyond family trust and closeness.", "NTA! I am a mum myself to a teen that discovers the internet with everything in it rn and it's not easy to take care and shield from harm. But you are 19 and not a teen anymore. It sounds like classic narcistic behaviour, taking control over everything you do and shame you for having your own opinion on things. Privacy is a granted right and you're entitled to it.\n\nThe cut off won't be easy but I'll assume you know you can get yourself a new emailadress and a new account for almost everything by yourself. You can share the old account then but stop using it. If she finds out tell her it's your adult account and stand by it.", "NTA she\u2019s very controlling. You\u2019re an adult she has to trust that you have to start making you\u2019re own smart decisions, my 11 year old son has more privacy.

Why would she need to know about all of that? Why would that be her business?", "Hell to the naw.

If they have any niggles or anything sounds off I say \u2018let me see\u2019 and they sign in and show me the conversation concerned and we discuss solutions. They were taught as children not to reveal their surname, school, town, county, parents jobs, sibling names, etc., anyone bringing up sex is a reportable red flag, how to block people, that \u201cFun at KFC\u201d is an okay caption but \u201cFun at KFC #Croydon #CarterHighGirls\u201d is not. They have needed less and less oversight as they matured and learned more social media security and skills. At 14 they have their own passwords and we chat like above. At 16 they are driving those talks, coming to me when they have concerns. At 18 they are adults.", "Hmm, how able are you to die on this hill? Is it necessary financially to live there? Still, you need to find a way to guard your privacy. Either directly or (less palatable) via subterfuge. The latter includes burner phones (you can get a more than smart enough not so smart phone for private convos quite cheaply and keep it hidden), as well as using pseudonyms on your chats or other more private chat services which require another login. \n\nIf talking doesn\u2019t work and you can\u2019t leave, a burner phone might be a good temporary fix, but the \u201chill\u201d will,still be there\u2019s.", "ig she's scared i might get knocked up young and not finish my studies T-T", "\"And it's also fine to not tell everybody to our parents.

You are an adult, and well beyond the \u201cneed\u201d of this kind of surveillance. \n\nPs. I have a 15 year old that I don\u2019t even treat like that. Your mom needs to learn to cut the cord. You are your own person. Your choices and their consequences are all on you now", "You are now becoming an adult and she can not read your messages until your 40. You need to take over the responsibility for your own life.\n\nAnd it's concerning that your friends to not want to write you because of her. I wonder how your mother grew up. Maybe she had struggles as a teenager why she is now so overprotective.", "Good luck!", "i once thought its because she had me young but she made it clear that was not the case so I'm honestly clueless on why besides her wanting me to be safe and such. Afaik she didn't have a really close relationship with her parents because they were both working so she resorted to relationships"]}
