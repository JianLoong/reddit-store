If you need paperwork from her to do that, just open a new account in your name only and move the money over.\n\nWhen I turned 18, my mom made a point of taking her name off all my accounts on the grounds that I'm an adult and she doesn't need access anymore.  I knew a lot of people whose parents were still on the account so they could send money, but they didn't snoop and had a healthy relationship; keeping the account joint was for ease of paperwork.  Unfortunately, your situation is one of the few where your mom is exerting control where it isn't due.\n\nShe's right that the way you act is reflective of how she is.  If you go around life acting fearful of whether you're doing what she perceives as the right thing, it's reflective of her raising a fearful child.  If you can't make a financial decision without wondering for days whether someone else will tell you that you did the wrong thing, she raised someone who doesn't have the knowledge and wisdom to make a good decision.\n\nSnooping on conversations is a whole different issue.  My parents didn't even do that when I was 12, and that was in the days of the \"idk my bff jill\" commercial running every fifteen minutes.  They'd ask me about what I talked about, and I'll bet if I said anything that worried them (e.g. \"I'm going to meet this stranger behind the grocery store\" not \"we talked about how excited we are for being grown up and making our own decisions\") they'd start looking, but to be reading through another grown adult's text messages is a huge problem.\n\nI know it's tough to get out, but a big red flag to you that this isn't normal should be that your friends don't text you about things they text each other.

If she's been reading your dms without your knowledge or consent, that is an unacceptable breach of your privacy that \"I was only trying to protect you\", or anything like it simply doesn't justify.\n\nI suggest changing the email addresses+phone numbers of all your accounts to yours and changing all passwords to accounts you feel she shouldn't be able to access, and enabling 2-Factor Authentication for good measure. If she knows your phone password, change that too as that should have your 2FA on it, and is therefore the most important thing to protect as your phone will be needed to sign into all the accounts your protecting.\n\nGo to the phones settings and set it to hide sensitive info on the lock screen, otherwise 2FA is useless. Your phone WILL have a setting for it\n\nI also suggest adding some diversity to the accounts, different usernames, passwords, email addresses all to make it harder for her to get in. Duckduckgo has recently introduced duck addresses which basically lets you have a random email address for an account while still getting emails for it on your main email address, it's free and fantastic.\n\nAlternatively you could set up new socials you keep secret, and not tell her about them (like I hope you did for this account).
