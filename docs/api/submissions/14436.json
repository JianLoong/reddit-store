Unfortunately, the only way out is to assert that you're an adult by changing your passwords and taking her name off the account (if it's a custodial or joint account).  If you need paperwork from her to do that, just open a new account in your name only and move the money over.\n\nWhen I turned 18, my mom made a point of taking her name off all my accounts on the grounds that I'm an adult and she doesn't need access anymore.  I knew a lot of people whose parents were still on the account so they could send money, but they didn't snoop and had a healthy relationship; keeping the account joint was for ease of paperwork.  Unfortunately, your situation is one of the few where your mom is exerting control where it isn't due.\n\nShe's right that the way you act is reflective of how she is.  If you go around life acting fearful of whether you're doing what she perceives as the right thing, it's reflective of her raising a fearful child.  If you can't make a financial decision without wondering for days whether someone else will tell you that you did the wrong thing, she raised someone who doesn't have the knowledge and wisdom to make a good decision.\n\nSnooping on conversations is a whole different issue.  My parents didn't even do that when I was 12, and that was in the days of the \"idk my bff jill\" commercial running every fifteen minutes.  They'd ask me about what I talked about, and I'll bet if I said anything that worried them (e.g. \"I'm going to meet this stranger behind the grocery store\" not \"we talked about how excited we are for being grown up and making our own decisions\") they'd start looking, but to be reading through another grown adult's text messages is a huge problem.\n\nI know it's tough to get out, but a big red flag to you that this isn't normal should be that your friends don't text you about things they text each other.  I can't say exactly what you should do, but you need to establish better boundaries with your mom, otherwise it's just going to get worse.  I saw it myself in other people when I was your age.", "Change yer password and do not give her the new one. You are an adult and she is seriously over stepping boundaries.
