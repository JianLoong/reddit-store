She got quite wasted but I don\u2019t drink a lot so I played it safer and stayed pretty coherent.\n\nAt one point she was in the bathroom vomiting and crying and looking though pictures of her ex on Instagram. All the other girls were comforting her and talking about what a piece of shit he is etc., the next maybe hour turned into fixation on her ex, how they should have been the ones married etc.,\n\nHer ex recently had a baby with his new wife so I understand it may have opened old wounds, but they split up 5 years ago.\n\nI am also one of the few people who actually know why they split up and all I can say is it was definitely her fault. \n\nAfter the hour I tried to get us all out of the bathroom and continue the night. The next morning things seemed fine but then my friend was going through her phone and saw she had called her ex 10+ times. She freaked out but the calls were all so short we assume he didn\u2019t pick up.\n\nI told her she needed to delete his number from her phone and move on because it wasn\u2019t fair to the guy she is marrying if she continues to be hung up on her ex.\n\nEveryone got really upset with me for being insensitive and I was made to feel like it was my fault for letting her call him. Eventually my friend asked me to go home early. I learned from one of the other bridesmaids that they spent the rest of the morning bashing me in addition to ex. I was told part of a bachelorette party is getting closure with old relationships and my judgmental attitude ruined it for the bride to be.\n\nI talked to my sister about it and she said while my friend was being ridiculous that it\u2019s my job to put aside my feelings for the bride as MOH. We are all in our 30\u2019s though and this seems very odd to me.\nAITA?\n\nUpdate: Wow! So many comments! I\u2019m at work right now but trying to read as many as possible. I didn\u2019t expect to get as many responses. Thank you for all the judgement.\n\nI just want to put this here as a lot of people keep saying I should tell her fianc\u00e9. In any normal situation I would agree but in this case she has been asked in the past to choose between him and her ex. She chose her ex, she made it clear to her now fianc\u00e9 she would rather be with her ex. But her ex said he didn\u2019t want her and left, so she stayed with her now fianc\u00e9. He knows on some level. Telling him wouldn\u2019t be a big revelation and likely wouldn\u2019t make him end the wedding. It would just make him sad and \u201crub his nose\u201d in something that he is aware of.\n\nSecond Update: I\u2019m so sorry these are so scattered I spent most of my break catching up on comments and a few more main points to address-\n\nThe other bridesmaids are not my friends, I\u2019m only friends with the bride. \n\nAlso people keep asking why I am her friend. One main reason, as sad as it is I didn\u2019t have a real friend until university. The town I grew up in was very small and conservative and I\u2019m a gay woman. When I came out in Highschool I became a pariah. \n\nShe was the first person who was ever kind to me, ever stood up for me and was my first friend so I think maybe I have been more willing to turn a blind eye to her poor choices than I should be. But I am reconsidering that now. I do have a much better and broader support circle now but I do think I see see her as that kind freshman and sort of my savior which clouded my judgement in not being more upset with her toxic choices over the years.", "created_utc": 1673507733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109tbzs/aita_for_being_brutally_honest_with_my_friend/", "score": 3651, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

True friends should be able to tell each other the honest, even if it hurts, truth.  \n\nShort history.  My very best friend, Pam, who is like a sister to me was dating this guy who cared very much for her and she really liked him but she wasn't ready for a serious relationship at the time.  She would tell me constantly about their \"friendship\" and I must say he treated her like a queen.  After 3 months, and she had no developing feelings for him, I told her that she need to stop stringing him along and let him find someone who will give him the love that he deserve.  That I know that she loved the attention he gave her but she wasn't being fair to him.  I had to remind her that we've both been in his place and it didn't feel good and how we wasted time (a year or two) with people who didn't want to be in a committed relationship.  She told me that I'd slammed her with a bucket of ice cold water with the facts and she ended their \"friendship\" that week and was honest to him about her not feeling what he felt for her.  It's been 15 years since that happened and we are still sister friends and every now and again, she will bring this story up and tell me that while what I said stung, I was the only one of her friends to be completely honest with what she was doing was wrong.\n\nHopefully, your friend will have a chance to sit back and think on what you said and realize  you said what you said not out of maliciousness but because you cared for her and her soon to be husband.

Calling your ex multiple times on your bachelorette party is one of those times you should speak up and get her to pull her feet back on the ground.\nAlso, bachelorette parties are NOT to get closure with past relationships. It's to celebrate the one she is in and what it's about to become! This is among the dumbest things I have heard, sheesh.\n\nIf she was the one who was the reason her ex and her are no longer together, she might be regretting her past decisions or feel bad it happened the way it did.

A true friend doesn\u2019t throw you out for telling the truth or talk shit about you when your backs turned", "NTA. \n\nA bachelorette party is supposed to be about you celebrating one last time as an unmarried person before you get married. At mine, we drank, skinny dipped in a lake and played some risqu\u00e9 ring toss and pin the junk on the hunk. \n\nAt no point did I obsess over an ex and stalk them let alone call them.  It\u2019s really unhealthy, and I think you did what was right. You told her what she needed to hear. It\u2019s unfair to herself and her fianc\u00e9 if she\u2019s still hung up on her ex. It\u2019s not the time to live in the past.", "NTA, What you said was valid and direct. In my friend group we can have conversations with eachother like this. Its a sign of a healthy friendship if they can call you out (direct and compassionate, just the way you did) when you do something out of character or just messed up. And these people seem like the kind that would let you crash and burn and then just talk about you behind your back. Not the friends I would want in my life. It sucks to experience this but sometimes we outgrow people and you will have this discernment with the next friends.", "NTA. What you said was completely right, and it was not rude or cruel.

NTA", "NTA lol what a loser", "NTA.   From what I can tell you were only trying to help your friend and telling her what she needed to hear.   I realize she was intoxicated at the time of trying to contact her ex, but intoxication is no excuse for poor choices.   And if they did spend the rest of that morning bashing on you and the ex, that makes everyone except you an asshole in this situation.", "NTA", "You were gentle with what you said imo I don't think she should be getting married at all if she's still THAT emotionally charged over a past relationship, and I think her fianc\u00e9 deserves to know about what happened that night.

Her calling her ex is way out of line. Especially now that he has a family of his own.\n\nI think we all have that \"what if\" ex. The one that if stars were a bit more aligned things would have worked out differently. Mine was at my wedding and I was at his (he's told me in the past I was his one who got away). We love each other as friends but there's a reason we didn't end up together. \n\nYou still don't pine over them before your wedding. You damn sure don't call them...

Poor guy.", "Putting my petty little self into OP's shoes...  if the bride and other bridesmaids are talking shit about me, then I would be temped to put a little bug in the groom's ear about what happened.  If she is this hung up on her ex, then this marriage is not going to end well.  Better to postpone it so the bride can deal with her past and move on, or cancel it entirely.  Not fair to the groom.", "i'm so sad for the groom, he should know these things happened. absolute disrespect.", "so something i\u2019ve learned in the last year while realizing i am autistic \u2014 since i\u2019ve always been the friend who \u201cspoke the truth\u201d and was scapegoated like you here \u2014 neurotypical people don\u2019t actually like the truth or people who tell the truth and are direct. they perceive it as rudeness. it\u2019s weird.", "I'd remind her of her supposed appreciation for honesty.

But it NEVER occurred to me to contact any of them. \n\nIt's a good idea before you get married to do an internal check in, make sure you're not hung up on anybody and you're definitely 100% in on this relationship, but that's wildly and entirely different from crying over someone's insta and then trying to drunk dial them. \n\nNTA, OP. You were the lone voice of sanity.", "Yep, this! Find another MOH because I will walk away from this fuck fest. AMF! Hahaha!", "We both have mixed-gender friend groups with a lot of overlap, so we each went for dinner and a few drinks with our core friend groups and then met up in the pub to finish off the night in one big bunch. It was fun.\n\nEdit: For us, and for most of our friends, the purpose was basically a fun night out with close friends, before the serious wedding day with all the ceremony and family. Nothing deeper or more dramatic than that.", "I think it depends way more on the age. At 25 yep all my friends had strippers and clubbing and way too much booze. At 35 half of them had been married 10 years, had kids and were allowed to be out until 10 or 11 if they promised their spouse they wouldn't be hungover.", "I was to blame because I was the most sober. The problem was I wasn\u2019t with them 100% of the night. I had to go and help one of the bridesmaids because she left her phone at the bar and I had to go pick up food because the place the bride wanted didn\u2019t deliver late night and she didn\u2019t like any of the places on ubereats. So it was impossible.", "Lmafo, I think the best plan at this point would be for her to actually talk to her ex and get the \u201cclosure\u201d she is after.

Otherwise you'll probably carry the guilt of letting him go through with this and not doing anything to stop it when you knew", "the friendship is already ruined IMO, and ruined by the bride and the rest of the bridal party", "I still have the phone number of everyone I've ever saved in my phone in my entire life. I'm not figuring out how to delete stuff!", "Only weird if you still want him back\u2026 but since you did not drunken call him at your bachelorette I think you are fine. Unless he is doing that on his bachelor party.. then you might have a problem :p", "It's very normal if you're in a close knit friend group or live in a small town. I certainly stayed friends with my exes in college when we saw each other all the time. After a little awkwardness, it sort of evened out as a casual friendship with someone you happen to know very well.\n\nThat being said, it's a little weird when your ex-fiance is your best friend. Seen that a couple times and it makes you wonder what emotional bandwidth is left for a romantic partner.", "Exactly! It was so fun, and I highly recommend it!", "And he should, he just needs someone to tell him that he very much is the second choice so he can determine if he truly is willing to accept that", "Yep and that the extent of it, I work alone at a 24/7 store and it\u2019s absolutely me who has the ultimate say.

I never really knew if that's weird because media/movies like to portray dramatic explosive breakups. Other girls I was friends with in college had dramatic breakup sagas that I didn't usually relate with.\n\nThere was one night I was at a house party at my ex's place (the same one getting married in a few weeks) and it was getting late. There were just a few people left, and in usual fashion we were all standing around the kitchen chatting. I looked around and had the strange and slightly awkward realization that I was standing in the kitchen chatting with 3 exes and my spouse.", "I feel like it was all just a pipe dream.", "How do we know the groom was innocent?  Maybe he was crying over his ex at his bachelor party.  And nowhere did it say the bride makes a habit of getting wasted and calling her ex.  She was at her bachelorette party, drank too much, said and did some stupid things. That probably happens at most bachelor/bachelorette parties. It's not a reason to tattle to the fiance.  It didn't even sound like she remembered doing it the next day.  \nESH, there was nothing wrong with telling the bride that what she did was not appropriate but because of how OP stated SHE doesn't really drink and stayed fairly sober, she sounds like someone who would have been snotty while rehashing the brides behavior the next day.  The bride and other bridesmaids who decided to shit talk behind OPs back are also jerks.  tbh, it doesn't sound like anyone in this group is very mature or likeable.", "Well you do you I guess. But if it was me I'd want to know what I'm getting into and wouldn't rely on the bride saying something to the husband because why would she?", "This is in no way an E S H the bridesmaid did nothing wrong and if I was the groom,  I'd want to know what I'm getting myself into.\n\nEta: getting drunk at a Bachelorette party (or at any time) is no excuse for poor behavior", "I understand this sentiment but the thing is I\u2019m pretty sure he knows. It came down to a choice between him and ex once and she was fully willing to throw him to the side and she made him fully aware of it. It wouldn\u2019t make him end the wedding it would just open old wounds and make him sad.", "I agree you were right to tell her, but I think you probably would have had more success if you'd spoken to her in private afterwards - she was probably already incredibly embarrassed by her behaviour and it can be really hard to have open and honest conversations like that in a group.\n\nTelling someone the truth is often necessary, but the way you tell them the truth can have a huge impact on their receptiveness to it.", "The only thing I thought about during mine was \"I should have worn a looser dress, because I can't stop eating this Colombian food.\" No regrets, though. Mmm, arepas.", "Seriously! As soon as I read \"part of a bachelorette party is getting closure with old relationships\" I was like... when/how was the bride-to-be planning to do that, exactly? By getting drunk, scrolling through his Instagram, and calling him 10+ times???\n\nLike, Bachelorette parties are definitely \\*not\\* for getting closure but even if they are, that's absolutely not what she was doing", "Yeah, short term this sucks but long term, this is likely going to be a win for OP in having had a whole load of multiple people purge their drama llama selves out of her life for her.

Who will I go to when I most need someone to treat me like garbage in return for my friendship, care and concern!", "You are not her mommy, she is not a toddler, and you cannot control a grown (?) woman's phone usage. Expecting one person, without even asking, to act as the designated non-fuckwit for a gaggle of drunks for the entire night is beyond the pale.  You also cannot be expected to be in more than one place at a time.  They just want to blame someone and you are it.", "I get what you mean, but he should hear it from someone. And we all know it won't be the fiancee.", "I wouldn\u2019t say her problem was \u201cremembering\u201d her ex.

Eventually my friend asked me to go home early. I learned from one of the other bridesmaids that they spent the rest of the morning bashing me in addition to ex. I was told part of a bachelorette party is getting closure with old relationships and my judgmental attitude ruined it for the bride to be.\n\nthis is a really weird overreaction to a rather innocuous comment. what exactly is it you said to her? could the tone have been interpreted as super judgmental or offensive? I don't understand why \"everyone\" at the party would get upset with you for saying this", "I would skip the rest of the dreary festivities if I were you and leave these friendships like the ex boyfriend did.

This is your fault?? I don\u2019t get how everyone turned on you so fast. I wouldn\u2019t tell her fianc\u00e9 anything about ex. It isn\u2019t your info to tell. I disagree about your duties as MOH/ bridesmaid. WHO said you were responsible for closure?? WTF. Where are these made up rules coming from. Wow. Sorry they screwed you. I don\u2019t see much wrong you did and now they\u2019re throwing you under the bus along with her ex. I would seriously reconsider this friendship with the bride. She sounds like a monster.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister is dead wrong. If your simple honesty caused the bride-to-be to ask you to leave the festivities, and for all of them to trash you as soon as you leave the room, I'd question whether any of these people are truly your friends, let alone close ones.\n\nThere's no need to be MOH to someone who holds you in such low regard. I'm sure one of the \"yes-maids\" would be happy to fill that role. Just tell her you'd feel like a hypocrite standing up for someone and being part of a party that treats you like used toilet paper.", "Wow, didn't realize high schoolers were allowed to drink and get married! /s But for real, your friends sound catty, and that's not because they're girls.

They are exes for a reason and stay that way!", "I think my tone was maybe a bit exasperated. When she revealed she had called him everything got really loud and frenzied. She started screaming and yelling like \u201cwhat do I do! What do so do!!!\u201d Some of the girls who were still hung over were like falling to the ground yelling at her to stop yelling and it was just really stressful. So I kind of maybe shouted (because everyone else was shouting) YOU NEED TO DELETE HIS NUMBER! But I don\u2019t think I was even heard. Once things calmed down I repeated \u201cYou need to delete his number it\u2019s not fair to \u201cfianc\u00e9\u201d.

I\u2019m having a hard time because where I\u2019m from people are very conservative and when I came out in high school everyone treated me like I had the plague.
