I'll never understand these friend groups that never tell each other the real truth. She doesn't sound like much of a friend tbh. Plus, I thought the point of a bachelorette party was one last night out as an unmarried woman not spending the night wishing I was marrying my ex? The fact is I feel bad for the groom because he's obviously second choice and he'll probably get treated like crap.", "NTA. Its not common, or healthy for a large part of the party to be spent pining over an ex and the BTB wailing that she should be marrying the ex not her HTB. To be honest, she probably shouldn't be marrying anyone until she gets over her ex. I feel sorry for her fiance.\n\nE: spelling.", "Clearly NTA here. You did nothing wrong in telling your friend to respect their partner and delete their ex\u2019s number.

It\u2019s your fault that she is hung up on her ex, that I\u2019m assuming she cheated on, and drunkenly dialed him 10 times after crying on the floor for hours!\n\nYou\u2019re right she should delete his number and be fair to the guy she is marrying. \n\nAnd how in the world is it your fault? Could you have taken her phone? Hahaha imagine that scene! Did you dial him? No!\n\nShe\u2019s a victim! She will always be a victim. Nothing will ever be her fault", "I\u2019m sorry but why is she getting married", "NTA\n\nYour \"friend\" is delusional if she thinks that part of a bachelorette party is about getting closure from old relationships. That is something that happens when you get serious about a relationship, not wait until a party before taking vows. Are you sure that you don't want to use this party as your way of getting closure on this \"friendship\"? After all the bashing she and her friends did towards you, you should just cut your losses and make this \"friendship\" a thing of your past.", "NTA she's about to get married and she's still drunk calling her ex. She should not be getting married. You were mild, her behaviour sucks.", "Yeah, it is odd. And immature. And not fair to her ex nor her fianc\u00e9. She was doing something stupid and you decided to be the only adult in the room. NTA.", "NTA. Real friends tell you the truth even if it isn\u2019t what you want to hear. You did just that.

You can't blame alcohol-induced disaster decisions on \"bride-to-be\". They're just bad decisions. The expectation that everyone would coddle the bride (to this messy extent) is unhealthy. \n\nYou're privy to the bride's damaging past. From experience, I can tell you that your status (as the knower of things that shouldn't be discussed) won't be rewarded. You'll catch fangs any time you step out of line, and your name will go through the mud before bride admits to what you know.\n\nBite your tongue, let everyone do exactly what they want to do for the wedding, and find a new crew.", "NTA. They can\u2019t blame you for the bride calling him T the same time they\u2019re reprimanding you for telling the bride to get over him!

Also you can't be blamed for her calling her ex. She's acting ridiculous and unfair to her SO and her ex.", "NTA. As a best friend, I would expect nothing but the truth.", ">I was told part of a bachelorette party is getting closure with old relationships\n\nThat's not a thing. If you still need closure you shouldn't be getting married.

I think the only reason things have escalated is a mixture of drink, heightened emotions and other people on the hen do sucking up to the bride.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you were brutal in the least, just honest and the others are just feeding the crazy. \n\nThis isn\u2019t what someone should be thinking and doing right before their wedding, no matter how drunk they are. She may not be able to be with the ex, but it also doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s ready to be with someone else for the rest of her life.", "NTA. You were trying to help her. Sounds like marrying this guy is a really bad idea. Don\u2019t understand why people were upset at you.", "NTA you were just being a friend to her. Friends tell each other what they think. Honestly she was probably out of line and didn\u2019t like you calling her out on it. But it doesn\u2019t seem like you actually did anything wrong here. Hopefully she realizes that and apologizes or at least talks to you about it so it doesn\u2019t affect your friendship moving forward. Good luck with that.", "NTA, telling the truth usually isn't fun, but necessary and the fact that she didn't know that it is an issue is a red flag to her husband, if he finds out about it", "NTA and what a group you were with! Yikes.", "NTA I feel bad for her husband, she is straight up trash and he should find better. You\u2019re a good friend for being real with her.", "NTA and she should not be getting married since she's clearly not over her ex. The bachelorette/bachelor party is so NOT about getting closure on past relationships", "Bachelorette party is last  celebration before you get your life connected to another. Or as it is said last night as \"single\". You should have all your eggs in the basket and skeletons cleaned out of the closet before you consider saying I do. What you said is a no brainier, however it's not usually well received.  Sounds like someone's still hung up, but deciding to settle.over moving on. NTA Edit: you're a better person then me, after that reaction I would have ratted to the groom.", "NTA your friend has a lot of emotional growth to go through before even dating someone yet alone marrying them! I can resonate with your role as the rational friend, it will always upset those who aren't ready to hear it. I'm sorry all of this transpired, but your friend seems greatly immature and though she's soon to be wed, maybe try keep some distance from her.", "NTA. You weren't even brutally honest tbh you were just trying to talk some sense into her. I'd tell her fiance about what happened too before they get married.", "NTA I\u2019d be telling her future husband about it just as a final fuck you then cut them out completely.", "NTA", "NTA and what you said was more than fair.  It seems though same age you are at a very different stage in life.  I think you should step down and probably look at separating ties for a bit.

A bachelorette party is usually to celebrate that you are getting married NOT spent crying over an EX...she clearly isn't over him or their relationship and probably shouldn't have said yes to someone else...it's been five years she needs to get help if she is doing this...what happens when she is drunk with her husband and pulls this crap. It's not cute. She needs to delete his shit and move on. She is acting like a teenager. Your the only one to tell her the truth.", "NTA. You were right to say she should delete his number since he has moved on with his life and she is supposed to be in the process of the next chapter of hers. It is unhealthy. Was this the first time it has happened while in this new relationship?\n\nIf this isn't the first time then someone needs to be honest with the fianc\u00e9 because I doubt anyone in that room is going to be. If she is still hung on on her ex after all those years then it is just going to get expensive for them later. It feels like you were the only person in that room that had the fianc\u00e9 in mind while the others were more focused on making sure the bride to be was okay.

You are not responsible for her behavior when she drinks irresponsibly. It was right of you to tell her to her face that this is a problem, and it will most likely be a problem in the long run with her current relationship because thoughts about her ex will always lie dormant in her mind.

If you had just left it at you need to delete that guys number, which again I agree with, then you probably wouldn\u2019t have been kicked. Alternatively if you had spoken with her in private after the panic it would have been a lot more sensitive.

The fact that all it took was alcohol for her to act like a total disrespectful ass, shows that she isn't a good fianc\u00e9 to her current man.

True friends should be able to tell each other the honest, even if it hurts, truth.  \n\nShort history.  My very best friend, Pam, who is like a sister to me was dating this guy who cared very much for her and she really liked him but she wasn't ready for a serious relationship at the time.  She would tell me constantly about their \"friendship\" and I must say he treated her like a queen.  After 3 months, and she had no developing feelings for him, I told her that she need to stop stringing him along and let him find someone who will give him the love that he deserve.  That I know that she loved the attention he gave her but she wasn't being fair to him.  I had to remind her that we've both been in his place and it didn't feel good and how we wasted time (a year or two) with people who didn't want to be in a committed relationship.  She told me that I'd slammed her with a bucket of ice cold water with the facts and she ended their \"friendship\" that week and was honest to him about her not feeling what he felt for her.  It's been 15 years since that happened and we are still sister friends and every now and again, she will bring this story up and tell me that while what I said stung, I was the only one of her friends to be completely honest with what she was doing was wrong.\n\nHopefully, your friend will have a chance to sit back and think on what you said and realize  you said what you said not out of maliciousness but because you cared for her and her soon to be husband.

Needless to say her ex was super weirded out when word got back to him that that was the reason for getting engaged so quickly to his friend.\n\nI always thought it was a bizarre thing to do.. like are you going to divorce the new guy if your plan works?

It's not fair to either of them for the bride to be hung up; one is married and the other is on his way to being married.
