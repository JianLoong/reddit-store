He does have a point, if you went into credit card debt for Christmas and then add to it for a trip, it isn't a great idea financially. You should only be taking trips if you have the money which you do not. It is ultimately your decision but keep in mind, financial literacy is a big point in deciding life partners, but in the end of the day, you can do whatever you want.

Have fun on your trip!", "You only live once.\nSeriously.", "NTA- He has no right to dictate what you can do. BF or not. He expressed his opinion about your financial decisions. Cool.

If you want to to then just tell him you are going.", "NTA, you know what your budget is and if this trip fits within it. Clearly he does not, or has other reasons he doesn't want you to go. If it is other, he needs to express that like an adult, not beat around the bush. If he gets guy/hunting trips, your shopping/girls trip shouldn't be a problem.", "YTA but to yourself for going on a trip when you don't have any money.", "NTA\n\nI have read some of the comments and you seem like you have control of you finances, so I do not see the issue. \n\nGo enjoy yourself on your trip.", "Are your friends single? He probably doesn't want their partying to rub off on you. Maybe them picking up guys at the club", "NTA. You are not springing this on him last minute, sounds like the Christmas expenses will be paid off soon, so a girls trip isn\u2019t unreasonable. Maybe ask what\u2019s causing him resistance to the idea of this? If he had a hunting week, he shouldn\u2019t begrudge you a little downtime with friends.", "YWNBTA.

You don't need his permission to do anything. It is always preferable to discuss plans, but in the end, the decision is ultimately yours. He enjoyed a week long solo trip before Christmas, there is no reasonable excuse you should not enjoy a 2 day solo trip at the time of your choosing.  \n\nJust thought of one possible reason: could he be planning a surprise getaway for the two of you before you have to return to work? If not, pack your bags and have a great time! \n\nNTA, at all.

She said almost no debt so while 500 might be a lot to some, it may not be to her. OP needs to go on the trip. He can go hunting 3 weeks before Christmas? Hunting is expensive. I live in the bush and if he was there for a week I can imagine he at least stayed at a lodge. Again, super not cheap. \n\nGo.

In your main post you just mentioned the christmas spending.   Are you on track to pay that off and have you missed payments in the past ?", "OK. You both sound like you are financially responsible.

Obviously, he is doing what he wants. \n\nCan I suggest that maybe you should put off buying a house together, if this is how he is going to respond? Sure rent is expensive and a home is an investment but it adds more pressure to the relationship and his reaction sounds kind of controlling.
