She lived hours away in her hometown and we had to drive 6 hours to get there and attend the funeral later. At first I didn't want to go and the reason is because of my BIL \"Michael\". He's my husband's halfbrother (mil isn't his mom) Michael and I had some issues in the past that I will not elaborate on. I went LC with him then full on NC. I asked my husband if Michael was going to be there and he said it was a no brainer since he and MIL had a close relationship. I didn't want to go and my husband argued about it for hours, then came home later and said that Michael would not be there due to travel issues (he lives in another state). I decided to go to with my husband but later on, I was shocked to see Michael walk up to us with his wife and daughter. I froze in my spot and looked at my husband because he lied about him not coming. I did not confront him because they embraced each other and started crying. His wife was watching as I turned around and walked away. I went to a hotel and stayed there. My husband called right after the funeral and was lashing out calling me ridiculous and unbearable for pulling this stunt and for walking out of the funeral and leaving him there alone. I said he lied to me about Michael's presence at the funeral and he wasn't alone, apparently he had his family with him. He got loud saying that I was insane to expect his half brother to miss the funeral of his stepmother and told me to get a clue. I felt so unset I started crying when he said that I was useless. I packed and went home but he further argued that I showed no empathy or support by not only walking out the funeral but also going home as well.\n\nWe argued when he came home and I explained again how he lied to me but he kept saying that it was illogical to expect Michael to not show up. He told me that I was a stuck up and need to get over myself.\n\n\nAITA for leaving after i felt uncomfortable by Michael's presence?\n\n\nETA it doesn't matter what Michael did and what issues we had, I out a boundary in place and saw that it was disrespected. A lot of family were calling me harsh for the NC but that's a boundary I put and it should be respected nomatter the reason behind it. When Michael first saw me, he looked at his wife and she looked at me like she was watching my reaction. There were kids around and I tried yo stay as calm as I could.\n\n\nETA I'm gonna go ahead and elaborate on these issues but will remain as vague as possible. The issues we had involved inheritance. FIL's inheritance. Michael and his wife wanted to keep the family home to themselves (since they have kids) and only let my husband have a small piece of land that was worth a lot less. My husband didn't care but I got involved and threatened Michael with court on my husband's behalf since it seemed like they were robbing him off and he did nothing to stop it. Michael called me a b&^% on numerous ocassions and said that my 3 miscarriages were \"karma\" after he claimbed I was driving a wedge between him and his brother.", "created_utc": 1667909232, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ypk7gy/aita_for_leaving_mils_funeral_after_my_husband/", "score": 3583, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I set boundaries the family harshly judged me like I was dramatic, etc. \n\nI don\u2019t know your details and you don\u2019t have an obligation to share them, but I know for me that the reason I did not attend my ex-FIL\u2019s wake or funeral (to be fair we were divorced by then but my entire family went aside from me) was because of not wanting to be near that brother. \n\nIf you feel uncomfortable and perhaps like he is some kind of threat to you, you are NTA.

The woman raised his Half brother you can't put him in a position where he either tells his brother \"you can't come my wife don't like you\" or be \"wife stay home I don't need you\" because he needed both of you, you could of stayed away from said brother and his family, you could of trusted your husband to protect you if you needed it, instead you thought of yourself and showed how little you give a damn about your husband, if you can't put the past behind for a few hours on a day like that then you should leave you husband because you care so little for him.", "YTA, ask yourself what is more important: your husband who needs you and your marriage or to show your brother in law how unhappy you are to see him.", "You walked out on your spouse as he was crying in an embrace with his brother while their mother is in a casket.

OP shared a boundary that they don't want to go into further detail and I think anyone can deduce by their freeze reaction and then later crying in a hotel that the past situation between them and BIL was serious enough it required nc. \n\nThis entire situation is a lose lose situation. Husband probably lies because he needed the emotional support of his spouse and wanted the emotional support of the spouse but in doing so was requiring her to be in close proximity to someone who obviously causes such a strong reaction. Maybe he shouldn't have lied and maybe she shouldn't have left but we don't know the dynamics and all have is what OP shared and it sounds like from what is shared the entire situation was a lose lose situation to begin with. \n\nEmotionally support your husband while you both grieve MIL death BUT face someone who was potentially abusive to you in the process (what a double whammy) or don't show up and both you and husband are emotionally estranged from each other while you both deal with the grief of loss and because it's such a high emotional state right now, not really able to work thru this issue for a while\n\nThis is really not a black or white issue and it just sounds really awful.  Sorry to OP for the many layers they deal with and sorry for their husbands loss as well.\n\nEta: NTA\n\nAlso thought about it more, if husband is aware of nc and prior to funeral was supporting nc then he shouldn't have lied and instead tried to come up with a solution that benefited everyone. Like asking she come but she can stay in the hotel  so at least he can go back to her immediately for support or even speaking to BIL and ensuring they can navigate around each other and then after the viewing or service wife can leave and not have to risk running into the BIL. Idk but the more i think about it the more it feels like husband required support in a very specific way that wife wasn't able to give if it meant having to face someone harmful to her and that's not unreasonable for her to set that boundary (assuming the reason is well founded). And then the husband was very verbally harmful after the fact, sounds really messed up. He doesn't get to take his grief and other emotions out on her. It's not her job to regulate him like that and do something harmful to herself as well.", "NTA, IMO. he should\u2019ve just been upfront & honest w you, people don\u2019t go NC for no reason lll", "It's hard to decide who the AH is without knowing more details.

It really does somewhat depend on what the brother in law did, but since you won\u2019t go into detail, no one knows to be able to properly judge.\n\nIf my husband left the funeral of one of my parents because he couldn\u2019t get over someone else being in the room and felt that that was a reason he no longer was going to be supportive of me, he\u2019d be getting hit with divorce papers so fast it would make his head spin. Grieving is not a linear path. Sometimes we make a lot of progress, sometimes we fall extremely behind.

But you just do them because you have to. Because there are some situations where you're not the most important person in the room and sometimes you just need to be there for somebody else.\n\nSucking up a bad relationship with an in-law for a few hours to support your husband after he loses a parent is one of those things.\n\nYour spouse is supposed to be a key part of your support system. In this situation she was useless and an embarrassment.\n\nI'm sure if what bil did was horrific, her husband would not be talking to him either.

Because you're not doing it for them you're doing it for your spouse because you love them and they need you.\n\nThat being said your husband is an a******.

Presumably, husbo knows her reasons, then reassured her that she wouldn\u2019t be exposed to BIL which as her post shows Husbo either knew that was a lie OR failed to at least prepare OP that BIL was going to end up there- or, give her time to not be there if she couldn\u2019t face it.\n\nSo, I think it\u2019s reasonable to believe that, at best, Husbo is a gutless wonder and at worst, a lying manipulator.\n\nNormally, yeah, I think it\u2019s the right thing to go to the funerals of a spouse\u2019s parent- but given the spectre of BIL\u2019s presence, Husbo should have at least been honest, on that info and that he needed her support at the service, but, for example, she could avoid the socialising afterwards\u2026", "YTA.

She lived hours away in her hometown and we had to drive 6 hours to get there and attend the funeral later. At first I didn't want to go and the reason is because of my BIL \"Michael\". He's my husband's halfbrother (mil isn't his mom) Michael and I had some issues in the past that I will not elaborate on. I went LC with him then full on NC. I asked my husband if Michael was going to be there and he said it was a no brainer since this he and MIL had a close relationship. I didn't want to go and my husband argued about it for hours then came home later and said that Michael would not be there due to travel issues (he lives in another state). I decided to go to with my husband but later on, I was shocked to see Michael walk up to us with his wife and daughter. I froze in my spot and looked at my husband because he lied about him not coming. I did not confront him because they embraced each other and started crying. His wife was watching as I turned around and walked away. I went to a hotel and stayed there. My husband called right after the funeral and was lashing out calling me ridiculous and unbearable for pulling this stunt and for walking out of the funeral and leaving him there alone. I said he lied to me about Michael's presence at the funeral and he wasn't alone, apparently he had his family with him. He got loud saying that I was insane to expect his half brother to miss the funeral of his stepmother and told me to get a clue. I felt so uoset I started crying when he said that I was useless. I packed and eent home but he further argued that I showed no empathy or support by not only walking out the funeral but also going home as well.\n\nWe argued when he came home and I explained again how he lied to me but he kept saying that it was illogical to expect Michael to not show up. He told me that I was a stuck up and need to get over myself.\n\n\nAITA for leaving after i felt uncomfortable by Michael's presence?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm fully in the YTA camp now.  \n\n\nYou absolutely were in the wrong for not getting over yourself and supporting your husband for a few dozen minutes at his mother's funeral.

The funeral is for the loved ones of the deceased to say their final goodbye, and to allow them to grieve collectively with others, if they want to. **It is absolutely not the place for petty fucking grudges, or for abandoning your grieving spouse who you ostensibly love.**\n\nYeah, your husband shouldn't have lied about his brother being there. But in that moment when you saw his brother, you had the opportunity to be an adult with empathy, express your regrets for their loss, and continue to support your husband through the grieving process.

How incredibly selfish and unfeeling of you.\n\nYou decided to edit to add how the entire grudge is about an inheritance that you **had absolutely no say in.** The inheritance was between your deceased father-in-law, your husband, and your husband's sibling(s). **Again, you took something that had absolutely nothing to do with you, and made it about you.** Your BIL was fine with how the inheritance played out. Your husband - by your own admission - was **also fine with how the inheritance played out.** The only person who wasn't okay with it was you, **and you did not matter at all in that situation.

You are mutual connections, perhaps, depending fully on what and why that NC was:\n\n>  they\u2019re justified to want Michael there despite the disagreement, and had never agreed to your boundary. Cause you\u2019re the AH there. And that\u2019s a choice people have, they can respect your boundary by declining to abide by it. We don\u2019t know they didn\u2019t tell you that, their actions don\u2019t say they did agree. They\u2019re not obligated to, you could indeed not go - but what\u2019s that say about you?

Just remember that no one was asking her to forgive her BIL or be friendly with him.

ETA, but especially you.\n\nEdit: All bets are off if he assaulted you in some manner, or threatened you with harm. But I doubt that, since you are keeping the reason to yourself and talking about your boundary, rather than alluding to a traumatic and terrifying incident. I think your NC with brother in law is more to stifle his relationship with your husband, and you are angry that it doesn't seem to be working.", "No it doesn\u2019t matter cause I had a boundary. Who cares if your mommy died, MY BOUNDARY!", "Lol Imaging being the kind of person who goes LC/NC from an in-law not saying \u201chappy birthday\u201d", "I feel if it was sympathetic she'd have alluded to or posted the reason by now. If I had to make an assumption, it's something petty/mundane.", "Seems you\u2019re right it was to do with the brothers fathers inheritance going more so to Michael and both brothers not caring but op cared on her husbands behalf which led to fights and Micheal saying something awful about her miscarriages.", "She updated.", "And IMO turned her into the full YTA", "it's one of those times the edit makes it all worse.", "OP has edited, it's about inheritance and he called her a b1tch. In which case she is still YTA. If husband doesn't care about HIS inheritance then why did it cause this much frustration for her. Bit ridiculous if you ask me.", "She\u2019s absolutely the wedge between the brothers.", "This feels like a case of he announced good news at a dinner where she was probably going to announce her pregnancy or it was her birthday or something. Going LC to NC really seems like it wasn't a case of physical assault or anything that serious. We could be looking at a bullying situation, but since she won't elaborate it's impossible to tell.", "Since apparently no one supported her decision to go NC it won\u2019t be SA or anything similar, so then it\u2019s a clear YTA.", "Exactly it's a BoUnDaRy sHe pUt iN pLaCe why can't you understand that /s\n\nthose fucking people......", ">I think the more important question is did husband really LIE, or did he believe BIL wouldn\u2019t be there?\n\nYeah this also definitely is significant. OP really seems to fancy herself as the victim and left out tons of context so we'd agree.", "> I think the more important question is did husband really LIE, or did he believe BIL wouldn\u2019t be there?\n\nThis is the first question I had too. It's very possible that he heard Michael wasn't going to be there. Either someone lied to him about it (knowing OP would cause drama) or it was true at the time but he last minute was able to get a flight or time off work or whatever.", "I can't even grasp the concept of leaving your romantic partner alone in is parents funeral.\n\nMy FIL die a few weeks ago, my hubby couldn't even drive by himself. I had to pick him up from work, make both of ours bags, make arrangements for our dog, then drive for 6 hours to attend the funeral. \n\nHow can someone just leave their partner alone to deal with everything by themselves?\n\nWe also have LC and NC family members. They were there, we just ignore them and go with our lives.\n\nIf I refused to support my partner on a parent funeral, my relationship was over in that moment.\n\nFrom the edit looks like OP is a little bratty, everything needs to be around her (me, my boundaries, me) even on a funeral day, and the big deal with Michael apparently wasn't that of a big deal and she knows that telling what happened will not play in her favour in here.", "Exactly. We can attend a funeral with people we don't like or don't talk to.\n Just be there and ignore them. That's it.\nSupport the ones that need the support, ignore completely the ones that you don't like.", "Isn't that absolutely crazy?! Like here I was thinking the BIL raped her or severely abused her or something. But an inheritance that wasn't even hers?! That's small potatoes kind of stuff that normal people put aside for a funeral.\n\nNo wonder the BIL's wife was watching her for a reaction. I would be too. Like \"what kind of drama is OP going to pull this time... I bet she brings up the inheritance again!\"\n\nEdit to add YTA", "OP edited the reason and it's about inheritance. She got herself involved even though her husband didn't mind. So, I guess we can see a pattern of making everything about herself.\n\nYTA", "My husband doesn\u2019t get a long great with my brother.

If I was her husband I would be thinking about divorce if my wife couldn't support me at a parent's death and instead makes it about her.  Reasonable boundaries are okay to expect respect on, but OP hasn't given us any indication that her boundaries are reasonable, esp given the situation.  OP sounds pretty entitled and insensitive (but expects sensitivity from others).", "I thought the same thing over an inheritance that had  nothing to do with her.  Her husband didn't fight or care so she inserted herself and got called some names.", "It's so telling that even after OP caused the dispute, her husband and BIL hugged it out at the funeral. Her husband had no issues with the split, OP was the one who fought for a bigger share. She's a shitty entitled asshole who can only think about herself. No surprise she made the funeral all about herself. Husband should absolutely kick her out.", "Literally I would have divorced my husband if he had pulled something like that at my father's funeral. \n\nThat was most likely one of the worst days of your husband's life and he needed his spouse. But OP decided this was the time to put on a show.", "I have never agreed with any reddit post that told people to get divorced based on a snip it of a situation. However, I am inclined to agree with this post.  If my husband had done the same thing, I don't think I could respect him enough again to continue our marriage. I wouldn't want to be around that incase it started to shape my own opinions. I don't ever want to be like OP.", "I agree, divorce papers would be flying in your face.\n\nIf you cannot put aside your childish infighting antics and greave / support my partner then you're absolutely terrible as a human this thread should serve as a sharp reminder that OP needs to mature.", "Money does weird shit to people, man.

And tbh i really really really think she made up the miscarriage comment the more I think about it. She avoided the reason for almost 2 hour bc if she said what happened and didn\u2019t throw in that then there\u2019s no way anyone would take her side. And even if he did\u2026 OPs husband and BIL lost their dad. The husband is okay with BIL getting the home bc he\u2019s got children. And with how expensive housing is having a home that\u2019s paid for so that BIL isn\u2019t worried about his family living on the streets if things went real bad with his mental health or if something happened to his wife\u2026 her husband was content with this. She wasn\u2019t so while BIL and OPs husband are grieving the loss of their dad OP threatens to take BIL to court\u2026 bc her getting more $$$ is the most important thing. I really think a divorce is in her future.", "True what's the use of a partner that can't support you when you need them most. She was useless \n\nActually she was worse than useless she actually made grieving his mother harder", "That's another YTA for her. Your husband's relationship with his family is his business! It's not for you to manage!\n\n(If the brother truly said that about the miscarriages then a very soft E.S.H. but I'm starting to think OP is an incredibly unreliable narrator.)", "My gut is telling me that she made up the miscarriage comment, but he said she was driving a wedge between their relationship and called her a B****. And knowing how bad all that looks she needed to add something else to make her look less like the actual devil. I hope the husband gets a divorce. This is the second time he\u2019s lost a parent and OP instead of being his rock causes even more problems for his family when they lose a parent.", "This is just it.

He shouldn\u2019t have lied, but under the circumstances, I\u2019d give him a pass. It sounds like the original dispute was OP inserting herself where she didn\u2019t belong in the first place.

She wanted more of her husband's late FIL's inheritance even though he didn't. She threatened BIL with court over it.\n\nOP, YTA.", "And she's horrible.", "Yeah, she inserted herself into a family issue that no one else cared about.  Agree, YTA", "Without a doubt. Everything is about her and never about her grieving husband. She fought with his family over inheritance after his father died when he didn't want to. That's horrible. And then there is this. Jesus. OP needs to be divorced, but you know she's going to make his life hell in the process.", "Yes totally agree. She went a long way to fight for inheritance yet couldnt stomach sucking it up for one day to support her husband when his mother died ...", "No, it was just pure and simple greed.", "In most situations, you\u2019re probably correct.  Spending some time on this subreddit, though, has made me realize that families can do some pretty unbelievable things.  I do think if it were a generally accepted reason then she would give it, but I\u2019m trying to give the benefit of the doubt here.", "She updated it and honestly even trying to add sympathy it still reads as she is the issue.", "OP made it sound like the BIL had done something truly terrible. I was thinking that it was something violent, not a dispute over inheritance.", "It\u2019s not just about inheritance bil also said her miscarriages were karma. Doesn\u2019t make her NTA but that\u2019s valid enough to go NC", "I would wonder if she was the \"nice\" person when the will was being worked on, vs doing her level best to rake her hubby's brother over the proverbial hot coals. \n\nI'd guess the latter, and this woman is seriously a piece of work.", "There's really no acceptable excuse imo. I was no contact for *fifteen years* with my own dad who literally threatened to kill me and I still makes to suck it up for a few hours to go to his wife's funeral for my *step sister* who I only see a few times a year. I cannot imagine not being able to suck it up for the love of my life because of ap situation I created in the first place.", "She fought with BIL after FIL died over inheritance. She's never had his back when he grieved and is terrible.", ">I'm starting to think OP is an incredibly unreliable narrator\n\nYES. I felt this from the very start. She didn't want to give the extremely relevant context about her beef with BIL and then she seemed to tell the story without acknowledging her husband's feelings and making it about herself. \n\nShe 1000% seems like the person to make a melodramatic retelling of the story just because that's how it *\"felt\"* to her. Tbh, I highly doubt the husband even called her \"useless\". I'd be willing to bet he said something along the lines of \"you seriously can't just be there to support me when a parent dies? You're my *wife*. If I can't count on you when I'm grieving, when *can* I count on you?\" And she reacted like \"wow, I can't believe the *only* reason he wants me is to be emotional support and I'm useless otherwise. He doesn't care about *my* boundaries around the drama I started up when his his last parent died!\"", "Or she didn't make it up but skipped some massive build up.", "So something that he didn't even do? She's horrible.", "Right! She inserted herself into a family inheritance issue that everyone else was fine with.  WTH!\n\nEdit - auto correct", "She made both of his parents\u2019 deaths about her. How awful.", "Wow I was thinking it had to be something major like sexual assault.\n\nBut the reason she can\u2019t support her husband is only about money?  She\u2019s definitely TA", "So definitely petty. I usually hate making assumptions in these posts, but it was clear her reasons weren't sympathetic.", "I mean, OP is definitely TA, but BIL also said that her miscarriages were \"karma\" for her behavior around their father's inheritance. She shouldn't have stuck her nose in when it was clear her husband wasn't bothered by the inheritance split, and she *most definitely* should have put her feelings aside for the couple hours required for her MIL's funeral...but I wouldn't want to be in contact with someone who essentially told me that I deserved having multiple babies die either. So it's not *just* about how the inheritance was split up.", "Funny How she talk about \"boindaries\" being crossed when she crushed her HUSBAND's boindaries going to court against his family for an inheritance that was already solved. Her husband is a saint for forgive that. Seems like she h\u00e1s an habit of making his parents death about herself.", "Yeah like it's not like she has to talk to him at the funeral. It's also not like he physically hurt anyone or sexually abused anyone. Very silly hill to die on.", "I need to edit.  She updated with the reason. She\u2019s TA.", "I've just read the update. Now she looks like someone who just wanted more inheritance from her husband side of the family when the husband himself was ok with how things were arranged. So she is NC because she tried to divide a family over inheritance, that the husband didn't care? And the BIL caller a b* because she was actually threatening to sue him over that? \n\nSo it doesn't play in her favor to be honest", "Def valid to go no contact. BIL also sucks. But in my opinion, that is something that should be put aside for a circumstance like a funeral for your husband. Some might disagree. But OP just sounds petulant. Just remember that no one was asking her to forgive her BIL or be friendly with him. She was asked, at this one-in-a-lifetime, nonrecurring, very difficult day for her husband, to simply exist in his presence.", "Agreed she's still an AH... the miscarriage comments were vile. Overall I think the OP is generally an unpleasant person herself.", "Lol, she dragged them through probate dude, BIL should have gone NC with her for that stunt, she should be lucky to have just gotten angry rude comments after getting involved with an inheritance *that wasn't even hers to begin with*", "Yes, what BIL said was horrible and absolutely disgusting and going NC is absolutely ok. Didn't mentioned that in comment, but thank you for adding it! (Still don't think it was appropriate for her to try to go to court with the whole inheritance issue without her husband's consent)", "I'm also taking that with a grain of salt. Op kept saying it was a boundary issue. Then only later added this supposedly horrible thing that has nothing to do with personal boundaries. She also insists on keeping vague yet shared detail issues against him, leaving out what all ahe said and did.", "I mean, it sounds like he did decide how the will was executed, but OPs husband was fine with it. However the the bit about her miscarriages being karma is pretty damn awful and uncalled for and I don't think he should get a pass for that. But OP is a huge asshole for inserting herself in the inheritance when her husband was okay with the situation (and why didn't her husband get her to butt out before lawyers were involved???). It sounds like everyone sucks in this family, but in this particular situation OP is a huge AH.", "She sounds greedy.", "OP is selfish and greedy", "Yeah if it was some kind of sexual assault type situation I\u2019d be very sympathetic to her, but I was getting the impression it wasn\u2019t even before the last edit; with that she\u2019s firmly the asshole.", "It\u2019s apparently also cause BIL said her miscarriages were her fault", "It's between the lines. When they don't want to disclose something anonymously, then clearly it's something she knows would not make her look good.

Can\u2019t get more entitled than suing over an inheritance that\u2019s not even her own, when the inheriting party is okay with it.\n\nTo edit this, I can\u2019t see the husband staying much longer. She overstepped boundaries before and now isn\u2019t even willing to support him in grief?", "Completely agree. Husband should not have lied; she should have gone and stayed away from BIL.", "Exactly. He definitely shouldn't have said that but op threatened to sue him and called him a thief (during grieving) so he probably wasn't his best self. While op sounds constantly horrible.", "Yes. Not saying the BIL is a good guy but she got mad at the inheritance that was between her husband and his family, not her family. She had nothing to do with it and Wouldnt be involved at all if not for her husband\u2018s part. None of her business and she\u2019s letting something like that get involved with a family funeral.

BIL going NC would be fine but saying someone\u2019s miscarriage is karma is not okay.", "It was absolutely disgusting for BIL to say that, but he was also lashing out after OP tried to push in where she wasn't needed and take his inheritance. She also seems to have driven a wedge in between her brother and BIL.\n\nBut it's also not some sort of ongoing pattern of abuse where she needs to stay NC from the BIL for her own mental health. She could have gone to support her husband and stayed on the other side of the room.", "I think in the whole case BEFORE the funeral, they both suck. He was heartless and cruel for his comments about her miscarriages and she had no business butting in to the family business involving inheritance. She's definitely TAH over the funeral, though. No one said she had to interact with BIL at all.", "She started shit with both of his parents\u2019 deaths!! I can\u2019t even imagine.", "I am wondering though (still wouldn't be right at all obviously) if maybe the OP said something similar(ish) to BIL. She mentioned they wanted to keep the house because they had kids, and with how much of an AH OP sounds I could easily imagine them saying something like \"you shouldn't have had kids if you weren't prepared\" and shit like that. OP tried pretty hard to hide the reason for NC so they're already an unreliable and biased storyteller."]}
