She lived hours away in her hometown and we had to drive 6 hours to get there and attend the funeral later. At first I didn't want to go and the reason is because of my BIL \"Michael\". He's my husband's halfbrother (mil isn't his mom) Michael and I had some issues in the past that I will not elaborate on. I went LC with him then full on NC. I asked my husband if Michael was going to be there and he said it was a no brainer since he and MIL had a close relationship. I didn't want to go and my husband argued about it for hours, then came home later and said that Michael would not be there due to travel issues (he lives in another state). I decided to go to with my husband but later on, I was shocked to see Michael walk up to us with his wife and daughter. I froze in my spot and looked at my husband because he lied about him not coming. I did not confront him because they embraced each other and started crying. His wife was watching as I turned around and walked away. I went to a hotel and stayed there. My husband called right after the funeral and was lashing out calling me ridiculous and unbearable for pulling this stunt and for walking out of the funeral and leaving him there alone. I said he lied to me about Michael's presence at the funeral and he wasn't alone, apparently he had his family with him. He got loud saying that I was insane to expect his half brother to miss the funeral of his stepmother and told me to get a clue. I felt so unset I started crying when he said that I was useless. I packed and went home but he further argued that I showed no empathy or support by not only walking out the funeral but also going home as well.\n\nWe argued when he came home and I explained again how he lied to me but he kept saying that it was illogical to expect Michael to not show up. He told me that I was a stuck up and need to get over myself.\n\n\nAITA for leaving after i felt uncomfortable by Michael's presence?\n\n\nETA it doesn't matter what Michael did and what issues we had, I out a boundary in place and saw that it was disrespected. A lot of family were calling me harsh for the NC but that's a boundary I put and it should be respected nomatter the reason behind it. When Michael first saw me, he looked at his wife and she looked at me like she was watching my reaction. There were kids around and I tried yo stay as calm as I could.", "created_utc": 1667909232, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ypk7gy/aita_for_leaving_mils_funeral_after_my_husband/", "score": 424, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP shared a boundary that they don't want to go into further detail and I think anyone can deduce by their freeze reaction and then later crying in a hotel that the past situation between them and BIL was serious enough it required nc. \n\nThis entire situation is a lose lose situation. Husband probably lies because he needed the emotional support of his spouse and wanted the emotional support of the spouse but in doing so was requiring her to be in close proximity to someone who obviously causes such a strong reaction. Maybe he shouldn't have lied and maybe she shouldn't have left but we don't know the dynamics and all have is what OP shared and it sounds like from what is shared the entire situation was a lose lose situation to begin with. \n\nEmotionally support your husband while you both grieve MIL death BUT face someone who was potentially abusive to you in the process (what a double whammy) or don't show up and both you and husband are emotionally estranged from each other while you both deal with the grief of loss and because it's such a high emotional state right now, not really able to work thru this issue for a while\n\nThis is really not a black or white issue and it just sounds really awful.  Sorry to OP for the many layers they deal with and sorry for their husbands loss as well.\n\nEta: NTA\n\nAlso thought about it more, if husband is aware of nc and prior to funeral was supporting nc then he shouldn't have lied and instead tried to come up with a solution that benefited everyone. Like asking she come but she can stay in the hotel  so at least he can go back to her immediately for support or even speaking to BIL and ensuring they can navigate around each other and then after the viewing or service wife can leave and not have to risk running into the BIL. Idk but the more i think about it the more it feels like husband required support in a very specific way that wife wasn't able to give if it meant having to face someone harmful to her and that's not unreasonable for her to set that boundary (assuming the reason is well founded). And then the husband was very verbally harmful after the fact, sounds really messed up. He doesn't get to take his grief and other emotions out on her. It's not her job to regulate him like that and do something harmful to herself as well.", "NTA, IMO. he should\u2019ve just been upfront & honest w you, people don\u2019t go NC for no reason lll", "It's hard to decide who the AH is without knowing more details.

She lived hours away in her hometown and we had to drive 6 hours to get there and attend the funeral later. At first I didn't want to go and the reason is because of my BIL \"Michael\". He's my husband's halfbrother (mil isn't his mom) Michael and I had some issues in the past that I will not elaborate on. I went LC with him then full on NC. I asked my husband if Michael was going to be there and he said it was a no brainer since this he and MIL had a close relationship. I didn't want to go and my husband argued about it for hours then came home later and said that Michael would not be there due to travel issues (he lives in another state). I decided to go to with my husband but later on, I was shocked to see Michael walk up to us with his wife and daughter. I froze in my spot and looked at my husband because he lied about him not coming. I did not confront him because they embraced each other and started crying. His wife was watching as I turned around and walked away. I went to a hotel and stayed there. My husband called right after the funeral and was lashing out calling me ridiculous and unbearable for pulling this stunt and for walking out of the funeral and leaving him there alone. I said he lied to me about Michael's presence at the funeral and he wasn't alone, apparently he had his family with him. He got loud saying that I was insane to expect his half brother to miss the funeral of his stepmother and told me to get a clue. I felt so uoset I started crying when he said that I was useless. I packed and eent home but he further argued that I showed no empathy or support by not only walking out the funeral but also going home as well.\n\nWe argued when he came home and I explained again how he lied to me but he kept saying that it was illogical to expect Michael to not show up. He told me that I was a stuck up and need to get over myself.\n\n\nAITA for leaving after i felt uncomfortable by Michael's presence?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I mean, how dare he be angry because his wife is more concerned about the presence of someone who upsets her than her husband grief and pain???", "He only lied after she refused to be there to support him, hence the argument before he lied.  If he lied; maybe there were issues that the BIL shared that made it unlikely the BIL would be there.  \n\nAs far as the useless comment, she was in this case.

Then her husband turned it on her and gaslight her. No if he wants his step brother that much it might just cost him his wife.

But YTA since we don\u2019t know what he did", "I think the call shows her character. She did not say anything negative about the husband even though he\u2019s yelling at her and calling her names.  Nor did she really react to his deceit and manipulation beyond calmly walking out of the funeral. \n\nHer response to those events shows that whatever BIL did it must be pretty bad to go NC. Also the fact that she went LC first shows an attempt to resolve the issue prior to going NC. \n\nI don\u2019t think these are the actions of a narcissist as some commenters have said.", "Yep, this is what I was thinking. In general you don't need a reason to go NC with someone, that's your prerogative. But, if it comes down to something like this, causing issues at a funeral when a family is trying to grieve, then it's kind of something you need to get over if you don't have a valid reason. If he called her stupid once and she decided to never be in a room with him again, that doesn't override supporting your husband through the death of his mom, she needs to suck it up. If he sexually assaulted her, I'd be applauding the fact that she just walked away without punching him in the face. The context makes a big difference here.", "Not being heartless, just factual.

They are dead.  If you have to grieve, you do it silently on your own time.  Having a significant other around makes no since.  Op and MIL weren't related?  They weren't family.
