{"id": 15026, "submission_id": "12pelgc", "title": "WIBTA if I decide not to give half of my inheritance to my brother?", "selftext": "My (31M, American) great-uncle passed away recently, he was in his mid 90's and had been not well for a while. His last few years were miserable after his much younger (\\~20 years) wife died of cancer. I was always really close with my great-uncle and treated him as a grandfather of sorts, and he often told me how much I meant to him, I visited him a few times a month when I lived nearby, and called every week when I didn't. My brother (33M) on the other hand was not as close to him, despite him trying to maintain a relationship with him, mostly because my great uncle was a really difficult person and basically had a very short list of people he liked. He married for the first time at 75, and had no kids, so essentially my brother and I were the closest he had to grandkids. Also, he was extremely frugal in his life, and a smart and/or lucky investor, so after his death we discovered that he had \\~7.5 million USD in assets, almost all liquid (no property or anything, which is actually crazy, but I digress). Of this, he decided to leave me 39% and my brother 9%. Obviously it's a huge amount of money, and that alone I have been trying to process as his attorney wraps up his estate and prepares to distribute his assets. My parents think I should give my brother half of my share so that we would be equal, which I have considered, but even my brother is not asking me to do it. I've been going back on forth on this, and although the last thing I'd want is to create tension between me and my brother, his 9% share is still a lot of money. Recently he told me he was thinking about buying a house, and I suggested that I could pay the down payment from my share and then own a piece of the house, which would be a way of sorts to help make it more even. To be honest, I wish my great uncle would have just given us equal shares to begin with, but he didn't, and just giving away money is not an easy decision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR, an elderly relative died and in his will he left me 4x as much as my brother.

If you were closer to your great uncle, that seems reasonable. However, offering to pay your brother\u2019s down payment doesn\u2019t make anything more even if you expect to then own a piece of his home. If you really want to make a gesture of fairness, just pay the down payment as a gift without taking ownership.", "Nta\n\nYour parents are assholes", "NTA - \n1) your brother wasn\u2019t close to this great uncle \n2) your great uncle gave you the larger share all the while still giving your brother money two (and you also stated 9% is still a lot of money so it\u2019s not like your brother will be broke) \n3) you can reassure your brother that you will always be there for him if he is ever stuck financially \n\nYour great uncle wanted you to have all of this money. If I were you I wouldn\u2019t split it but would be there if other family members were in need. \n\nDon\u2019t listen to your parents, it\u2019s bad advice. Especially if your brother isn\u2019t asking for money.", "NTA - You don't have to share your inheritance with your brother. It was your uncle's choice to leave you a more significant share of his assets. Your brother was not left out of the will. And frankly, you and your brother are adults and your parents really don't get a say here. \n\nThat being said - saying that you will pay your brother's down payment and then own part of his house does nothing to make the situation \"more even\".", "No, it\u2019s not your place to \u201cre-work\u201d your uncle\u2019s will. He left you what he left you and you don\u2019t have to feel guilty about that at all. your uncle most likely felt that you earned it because of how well you treated him, so don\u2019t second guess yourself. Your uncle didn\u2019t have to give anyone anything, so even the 9% is very generous.", "Nta legally it's yours, but you stated your brother tried to maintain good relationship with him yet your uncle didn't bother  returning the favor.\n\nMorally, maybe if he was even asking giving some would be the right thing but you also stated he wasn't even asking for more inheritance. So it's entirely up to you, maybe a little bit maybe not, but as long as you are communicating with your brother, you will understand best what you need to do.\n\nPersonally I'd do the down payment for the house as a gesture of understanding and kindness, and consider my conscious clean after that.", "NTA. YOu don't have to split. Your uncle wanted you to have the money. So therefore it is yours to do with as you wish.", "YWNBTA.\n\nYour great-uncle created his will intentionally.  And it seemed like he had a great connection with you but not with your brother.  If you give your money to your brother you are effectively disrespecting your great-uncle's wishes - and your parents are doing so by encouraging you to split what he gave you.", "It's your uncle's money, he got them, he splitted them. If you give half of it to your brother then that's a disrespect to your uncle. Neither you neither your brother worked for this money. You don't have to give anyone anything by force, NTA", "Also if you gave your brother the money you would have minor tax liabilities because it is now a gift from you to him", "YWNBTA if you did not split your share. In fact, I would suggest it would be an AH move if you did. Your great-uncle clearly made very specific decisions about what he wanted to do with his money, and it is not like he even disinherited your brother. Don't disrespect your great-uncle's final wishes.", "Nta your uncle knew what he was doing and sometimes inheritances just aren't fair.", "NTA\n\nYour brother has even stated to you that it's not necessary to \"even things up\". I can only presume that your great-uncle had left you that specific amount as a mark of respect for the care and time you gave to him in his later years.\n\nIf you chose to put a down payment on the house (with agreeance from your brother, of course) then that'd be down to yourself, by all means, and would be generously appreciated by him, I'm sure.", "NTA, your great-uncle made his wishes clear in his will, and if you share your inheritance with your brother then you are not honouring your great-uncle's wishes. It isn't as it it was an old will which a younger sibling was missed off, and 9% and 39% are very deliberate figures. \n\nOf course, if you do pay the down payment on your brother's house from your share, you would be best ensuring any agreement is put in writing to clearly establish that this is an investment in the property not a gift.", "YWBTA if you pay his down payment but then expect a part ownership of his home. That would be really odd", "NTA. When it comes to someone's last wishes, you respect them (as long as they're reasonable). You were closer to him. He didn't completely cut your brother out. He just didn't get as much because he wasn't as close.", "NTA. It\u2019s your choice to do with it as you see fit. It\u2019s the same answer given EVERY TIME someone asks a similar question.", "NTA. Your uncle passed along his estate as he, not your parents, saw fit. You are under no obligation to modify (i.e., go against) his wishes by redistributing your portion of it.\n\nHowever, your parents may decide to rebalance the scales by leaving most of their estate to your brother, as is also their prerogative.", "NTA.  There is no need for you to give your brother money.  His 9% of $7.5 million (\\~$700k) is enough to buy a couple of houses in most markets.  You are both in great shape.", "So it is not your brother who is badgering you for money, but your partners are, on his behalf. This is easy: \u201cMom/dad, yes indeed, Brother and I are discussing this very issue. We will sort it out \\*among ourselves\\*, no need to worry about it.\u201d\n\nIf they keep bugging you, repeat the above sentence verbatim.\n\nBoth your brother and you are adults, both are on the same page, and your parents are essentially trying to manufacture a wedge issue between the two of you, where there is none. Firmly and lovingly tell them to butt out.\n\nNTA", "NTA Your uncle gave you the money. Don\u2019t get into a joint home ownership deal with your brother. You know, he can probably buy a house all by himself with $675k.", "NAH! Your Uncle did not write your brother out of his will. He allocated his assets based on the closeness of his relationships.\n\nOffering to make the down payment on your brother's house and then \"own\" a piece of the house is a terrible idea. It actually will create future problems as you cannot own a part of a house. What happens in the future if your brother wants to sell it, falls on hard times, wants someone to move in you don't like, or can't pay the mortgage? The areas of potential conflict is endless in this type of arrangement.\n\nINFO: Does your brother have children? If yes, you could consider setting up an education fund for them. Done correctly, this would avoid the Federal Gift Tax; something you will be forced to pay if you simply give your brother part of your inheritance.", "just responding to a few comments, some clarifications too. 1, we grew up solidly middle class, never had any kind of wealth like this, and we also didnt know that my great uncle had anything like this either. 2. neither of us have kids, my brother has a long term gf who he will probably marry soon. 3., we always assumed that whatever money my great uncle had would go to his wife, who we assumed would outlive him (he thought so too). 4., the reasons I ended up being closer to my great uncle are partly because I lived in the same city as him for many years and my brother lived farther away, and partially totally arbitrary. my brother put in effort to stay in touch with him and visit him, but my great uncle was just often kind of a dick to him for basically no reason and I don't blame him for not being as close as I was. As for the down payment, I appreciate your comments and think maybe its better to just gift it no strings attached, but not sure on this either", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you're feeling conflicted, and it seems you are, setting up a trust fund to help with their college expenses might ease your mind.

Not half, but a substantial amount.  You\u2019ll feel the difference in wealth as you progress through the years. You\u2019ll get mad every time he hints he needs money or a loan. Better to just gift it and get it done with.  \n\nAlso you might want to explain (often) that you didn\u2019t get as much as everyone thought due to taxes and such.
