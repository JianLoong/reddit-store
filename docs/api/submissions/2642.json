She lives alone but her son (60yM) comes to check on her a couple of times a week. Just for context I and my DH(49) are retired early and financially comfortable. Also for context I am black woman and my elderly neighbor is white. So to my issue. My elderly neighbor has a lot of health issues which causes limitations. She can't cook for herself, she can't clean, she's incontinent and soils herself regularly. Her son lives 2 hours away and only visits at the most 2 times a week. I took it upon myself to take care of my neighbor. I go to her house every morning to administer her meds and make her breakfast. I make sure that she does her physical therapy exercises, buy her groceries at our expense. Sometimes I even stay over at her house if she's feeling particularly bad that day. One day I noticed a camera inside of her house and I asked her son about it when he dropped by. I thought that maybe he put it there to watch her in real time in case anything happens to her. But nope, he told me that he put it there to make sure that no one took advantage of her or stole from her. I am the only person who goes to her house. I told him that I was uncomfortable with him spying on me and he got upset and told me not to ever come to his mother's house again and that he'll come over daily to help her( he lives 2 hours away and works)So I complied. It was hard but I don't want legal issues. So we noticed that he hadn't been to check on her for about 2 days so at the risk of being arrested I went to check on her and she was hungry and sitting in her own filth so I called adult services and they now have him under investigation for elderly neglect and I have been appointed her caregiver until everything is sorted out. His wife keeps calling me telling me that I'm ruining her husband's life and he could lose his job and license. He is a LPN. Another neighbor said that I could have handled it better by calling him. My elderly neighbor told me that he said that he didn't mean any harm by recording me and that he's had some bad experiences with black employees and he was just trying to protect himself. Not her but him. She doesn't think like that but her husband did. AITA for calling AS or should I have called him first?", "created_utc": 1668782074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yylk92/aita_for_calling_social_services_about_my_elderly/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Instead of thanking you (or I don't know, reimbursing you), he treated you like a thief. I mean, he could have lied about the camera! He could have said it was to keep an eye on his mother. But he told you outright it was to keep an eye on you, as if there was nothing even slightly offensive about that. \n\nYou did not get him in trouble. His own behavior got him in trouble.", "NTA. He SHOULD lose his license. You are a saint for looking out for your neighbor's welfare, especially at the expense of your time and energy.", "NTA\n\nYou had good intentions & complied when he asked you not to come over. He said he would come over daily & didn't, so it's his fault for not upholding his end. \n\nYou did the right thing by calling adult protective services. Your neighbor needs round the clock care & her son obviously cannot do that.", "Social Worker here. **You are NTA and absolutely correct in calling social services.** Shame on your neighbor\u2019s son for letting his mother starve and sit in her own filth. No person should be treated in such an inhumane manner. My best friend is also a Social Worker who worked in APS for more than a decade. She would thank you for having the kindness to care and advocate for your neighbor. Bless you for your compassion.\n\nEdit: Also, the man deserves to have his life ruined. He should absolutely lose his LPN license. If he doesn\u2019t have the 2 cents to realize an infirm elderly person can\u2019t stay home alone with no caregiver, then he\u2019s probably a shitty LPN. He was also more concerned with his mother\u2019s stuff than her own wellbeing. Fuck that guy. (Pardon my language, but I\u2019m angry).", "NTA at all, she is lucky to have someone like you in her life that is willing to deal with this drama and still look out for her best interest. You are a lovely person!", "NTA She was being neglected.  You did the right thing.  There are plenty of programs to provide assistance and he didn\u2019t get her enrolled in one.", "NTA. \n\nHe grossly neglected his own mother and that's what got him into trouble. You did more than anyone could ask or hop for. And instead of showing some sort of gratitude or simply getting his s\\*\\*t together, he decides to act out his racism.", "NTA You are a kind and caring person, the world needs more you\u2019s in it.", "NTA. He told you not to go in her house again, and then just left her to sit in her own waste for two days. It's obvious that she needs much more care than he's able to offer.\n\nThe fact that he's a racist adds some additional murk to the situation, but isn't directly relevant. Remove the racism and the camera, and you still did the right thing.", "NTA and he needs to be ashamed of himself.\n\nYou were providing care for his mother.  For free.  That he wasn\u2019t providing.\n\n\u201cWell yeah but racism\u201d is not an okay reason.  If he\u2019s racist and doesn\u2019t want you there, then he needs to make arrangements for her care since she was living in a dangerous state of neglect.\n\nHe didn\u2019t want you in the home, so your choices were to 1. Call social services 2. Leave an elderly woman in her own filth to get septic and die.\n\nThat\u2019s not even a choice.  He might not even be on the hook for elder abuse since he didn\u2019t live in her home (the state would still have custody of her if she can\u2019t care for herself), but even if he is, so?  Child and elder abuse laws exclusively for situations like this.  And as an LPN, i believe at least in some states, he\u2019s a mandated reporter, so he absolutely should have known better.  His concerns about a black woman stealing being more important than his mother dying says a whole lot about his character.", "NTA. I would also consider reporting him to the state Board of Nursing. Maybe they wouldn\u2019t take action since she wasn\u2019t his patient, but on the other hand he was committing elder abuse against his own mother. They might be interested in that.", "**NTA**\n\nHe doesn't need a head's up, he needs to be charged with neglect. You absolutely did the right thing, and as someone who acted as caregiver to my own grandmother when she was in her 90s, and who now has parents in their 80s, and cannot IMAGINE letting them live like that (and I am severely disabled myself and need supportive care!), I wish I could hug you. You are the best sort of person, and your neighbour is so, so lucky to have you looking out for her.\n\nYou did exactly the right thing. If she is soiling herself AT ALL on a regular basis and struggling to care for herself, she needs supportive care. It doesn't even have to be full time or expensive. I get subsidized meals on wheels, and if she is not suffering from dementia she can have someone explain to her about incontinence briefs and how to properly deal with her bathroom issues. Even a care worker who stops in once a day to check on her would likely be enough. But these things absolutely CANNOT be left to fester. She could end up with serious infections. You are wonderful, and the exact opposite of an AH.", "JFC what kind of monster lets his mother sit in her own filth and WATCHES it on a camera?!? And his wife is no better! \n\nYou should have called sooner imo but don't feel bad for doing it now. I'd ask her if she wanted the cameras in her home also. If she said no, unhook them. His reason for having them is purely because of your skin color. That's disgusting. \n\nNTA but he deserves whatever happens to him", "NTA.  You found her sitting in her own filth?
