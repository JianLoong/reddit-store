She lives alone but her son (60yM) comes to check on her a couple of times a week. Just for context I and my DH(49) are retired early and financially comfortable. Also for context I am black woman and my elderly neighbor is white. So to my issue. My elderly neighbor has a lot of health issues which causes limitations. She can't cook for herself, she can't clean, she's incontinent and soils herself regularly. Her son lives 2 hours away and only visits at the most 2 times a week. I took it upon myself to take care of my neighbor. I go to her house every morning to administer her meds and make her breakfast. I make sure that she does her physical therapy exercises, buy her groceries at our expense. Sometimes I even stay over at her house if she's feeling particularly bad that day. One day I noticed a camera inside of her house and I asked her son about it when he dropped by. I thought that maybe he put it there to watch her in real time in case anything happens to her. But nope, he told me that he put it there to make sure that no one took advantage of her or stole from her. I am the only person who goes to her house. I told him that I was uncomfortable with him spying on me and he got upset and told me not to ever come to his mother's house again and that he'll come over daily to help her( he lives 2 hours away and works)So I complied. It was hard but I don't want legal issues. So we noticed that he hadn't been to check on her for about 2 days so at the risk of being arrested I went to check on her and she was hungry and sitting in her own filth so I called adult services and they now have him under investigation for elderly neglect and I have been appointed her caregiver until everything is sorted out. His wife keeps calling me telling me that I'm ruining her husband's life and he could lose his job and license. He is a LPN. Another neighbor said that I could have handled it better by calling him. My elderly neighbor told me that he said that he didn't mean any harm by recording me and that he's had some bad experiences with black employees and he was just trying to protect himself. Not her but him. She doesn't think like that but her husband did.

Instead of thanking you (or I don't know, reimbursing you), he treated you like a thief. I mean, he could have lied about the camera! He could have said it was to keep an eye on his mother. But he told you outright it was to keep an eye on you, as if there was nothing even slightly offensive about that. \n\nYou did not get him in trouble. His own behavior got him in trouble.", "NTA.

You are a saint for looking out for your neighbor's welfare, especially at the expense of your time and energy.", "NTA\n\nYou had good intentions & complied when he asked you not to come over. He said he would come over daily & didn't, so it's his fault for not upholding his end. \n\nYou did the right thing by calling adult protective services. Your neighbor needs round the clock care & her son obviously cannot do that.", "Social Worker here. **You are NTA and absolutely correct in calling social services.** Shame on your neighbor\u2019s son for letting his mother starve and sit in her own filth. No person should be treated in such an inhumane manner. My best friend is also a Social Worker who worked in APS for more than a decade. She would thank you for having the kindness to care and advocate for your neighbor. Bless you for your compassion.\n\nEdit: Also, the man deserves to have his life ruined. He should absolutely lose his LPN license. If he doesn\u2019t have the 2 cents to realize an infirm elderly person can\u2019t stay home alone with no caregiver, then he\u2019s probably a shitty LPN. He was also more concerned with his mother\u2019s stuff than her own wellbeing. Fuck that guy.

He told you not to go in her house again, and then just left her to sit in her own waste for two days. It's obvious that she needs much more care than he's able to offer.\n\nThe fact that he's a racist adds some additional murk to the situation, but isn't directly relevant. Remove the racism and the camera, and you still did the right thing.", "NTA and he needs to be ashamed of himself.\n\nYou were providing care for his mother.  For free.  That he wasn\u2019t providing.\n\n\u201cWell yeah but racism\u201d is not an okay reason.  If he\u2019s racist and doesn\u2019t want you there, then he needs to make arrangements for her care since she was living in a dangerous state of neglect.\n\nHe didn\u2019t want you in the home, so your choices were to 1. Call social services 2. Leave an elderly woman in her own filth to get septic and die.\n\nThat\u2019s not even a choice.  He might not even be on the hook for elder abuse since he didn\u2019t live in her home (the state would still have custody of her if she can\u2019t care for herself), but even if he is, so?  Child and elder abuse laws exist for situations like this.  And as an LPN, i believe at least in some states, he\u2019s a mandated reporter, so he absolutely should have known better.  His concerns about a black woman stealing being more important than his mother dying says a whole lot about his character.", "NTA. I would also consider reporting him to the state Board of Nursing.

You are the best sort of person, and your neighbour is so, so lucky to have you looking out for her.\n\nYou did exactly the right thing. If she is soiling herself AT ALL on a regular basis and struggling to care for herself, she needs supportive care. It doesn't even have to be full time or expensive. I get subsidized meals on wheels, and if she is not suffering from dementia she can have someone explain to her about incontinence briefs and how to properly deal with her bathroom issues. Even a care worker who stops in once a day to check on her would likely be enough. But these things absolutely CANNOT be left to fester. She could end up with serious infections. You are wonderful, and the exact opposite of an AH.", "JFC what kind of monster lets his mother sit in her own filth and WATCHES it on a camera?!? And his wife is no better! \n\nYou should have called sooner imo but don't feel bad for doing it now. I'd ask her if she wanted the cameras in her home also. If she said no, unhook them.

He was cooking and cleaning for a 60yr old lady who was unwell and gave up on ever getting better. She just wanted to stay home and enjoy TV and visits from friends. The province paid my dad to buy groceries to cook for her, and to clean her unit. A month ago she didn't want supper at supper time. She didn't call him for any food 2hrs later so went to see if she was hungry yet (sometimes she would eat too many treats) and he found her in a critical state. He broke a bunch of ribs trying to keep her alive until the ambulance crews showed up to take over (dad use to be a specialized nurse). As they worked on her she died in his hands. Her heart full on stopped. He was upset for a good while. A week later her parents turned up to thank for taking care of their daughter and being there for her last breath. During clean up (emptying her unit) her parents took some mementos, gave dad a lot of money for helping to clean up, and he was told that he could take anything he wanted as he gets first dibs. He now has more furniture, more dishes, more bedding, and a brand new bed she never slept in. He hauled a lot to restore and had a few poor seniors that he knew to pick through some things to help improve their lives. The rest went to the dump. He has about 5 seniors he helps care for, but she was his 2nd bestie as he always had supper with her and watched a TV program together.

Us kids and our families all know her, and everyone in the building really lol Dad nearly died 6yrs ago and all his senior friends came together to keep him alive, fed, clean, and someone was always babysitting him, as his brain was poisoned due to a bladder infection, so he was kinda a zombie.

He is a LPN\n\nI literally lol'ed at this.\n\nHe lets his mother sit in her own filth, unable to get her own food, and he thinks he *shouldn't* have his licence taken away?\n\nNTA", "NTA you care more about her than her own son!\n\nAnd sorry but I laughed at the comment your other neighbor made about him having bad experiences with other black people like \"oh, it's ok, he's just *RACIST*\" ffs", "NTA. What kind of LPN dumps his mother and doesn\u2019t take care of her. Let him lose his license. That\u2019s not your problem. He is in this situation because of himself. You did the right thing by protecting his mother.", "NTA, you know what would have prevented him from losing that license, Not Doing things that risk losing his license. It's relatively simple, if you want to keep a drivers license you avoid driving drunk.  If you want to keep a liquor license you don't sell alchohol to minors.  It's not hard to avoid doing things that risk losing your license.  He chose to neglect her and these are the consequences.  You did the right thing and protected not just your neighbor but others from him abusing them in the future.", "NTA\n\nMy grandmother had health issues but was capable of caring for herself. She kept herself fed, clean, kept her own house and because of a couple of neighbors that kept an eye out for her, she was able to stay in her own home until she was  94. She passed 6 months before her 95th.\n\nSome might call these neighbors nosy because the would look out their windows and if they couldn\u2019t see her in the house, they would go check on her. We were so thankful for them nosy or not because my grandmother didn\u2019t want to leave her home.\n\nThank you for being such a wonderful neighbor and friend to this elderly lady. I\u2019m sorry her son was so awful. Instead of seeing kindness and caring he saw skin color. It shouldn\u2019t have entered his mind.", "NTA he absolutely should lose his license. He's leaving his own mother to starve and sit in her own filth. As a caregiver for my own mother I cannot fathom how he could do this. I make sure my mum is fed, has her meds, goes to her appointment's on time (even if that means I have to wake up at 4am).", "NTA.\n\nYou did the right thing 100%. A woman in that condition needs proper care, and the fact that you were so quickly appointed her guardian points to the fact that he could have done something to get her a nurse, a care facility, or some other option, he just didn't want to deal with it.", "If it were my mom and she had a neighbor that behaved like you, I would literally worship the ground you walked on, buy you endless gifts and thank you every time I saw you. I would never ever tell you to stop coming over, or do anything to offend you. \n\nThere\u2019s so much I don\u2019t understand - why can\u2019t he move her to where he lives? If he\u2019s a proper LPN, surely he can see how ill his mother is and that she needs constant care? You owe this guy nothing. You did what was right all along. He deserves to be investigated. This lady is lucky to have you as a neighbour. NTA.", "[removed]", "NTA. He has been neglecting his mother and is finally going to hear about it.", "NTA. You\u2019ve gone above and beyond for his mother. Instead of being a racist ass he should be grateful.", "Absolutely NTA. You did the right thing, and it\u2019s awful that you suffered his abuse because of it.", "NTA", "You are a friggin saint. You have earned the right to never question yourself again if AITA, in any situation for eternity.", "NTA OP you did the right thing. My wife takes care of me like that full time it was her job for other people for over 20 years. Believe me I've personally seen the fallout from family not supporting seniors it is a sad sight keep the faith if you call that woman gets the help she so desperately needs.", "Exactly he should have done more, the OP was being considerate for supporting and helping their elderly neighbour just out of kindness. \n\nOP did the right thing.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

My mom lives several hours from me, and not only do i have her text me multiple times a day (when she gets up in the morning, etc), i also have several friends who are \"on call\" if something happens. If my mom needed the level of care his mom needs, there is no way she'd still be living at home. She'd be living in my home where i can help her.", "All it takes is one fall, one broken bone or fracture, then an infection to kill her. Sounds like he didn't care or that he wanted her dead. As an LPN he would have known about that and other problems caused by neglect. Perhaps he had life insurance on her.", "Yes! My best friend lives with her grandparents and when they became I\u2019ll and couldn\u2019t afford care, she asked the state for help and they appointed her their caregiver and now match her salary from her previous job ($45k).", "You are literally saving her by calling protective services.", "I think I read it wrong, but i associate being called an employee is that person is working for  as opposed to with someone. I\u2019m an RN and have never treated LPNs, CNAs, MA\u2019s , or front staff any different. We all have our purpose in the medical field and as in RN the last people you want to treat poorly is those coworkers. They do so much and when you need their assistance they are more willing to help those who respect them. It\u2019s unfortunate you have RNs treating you like that. Assisted living is one of the hardest areas to work in.", "Exactly. My mother-in-law made under a dollar more than allowed to qualify. It is a very low level."]}
