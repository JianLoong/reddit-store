You\u2019ll probably never hear from him again. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. This is strictly your decision. I didn\u2019t want to know either. We didn\u2019t find out the gender/sex of our kids until they were born.", "The interest he's taking in the baby is a little concerning. He wants to know if you're giving him a boy. If it's a boy will he suddenly decide he wants custody? Or to spend time with it without you? If it's a girl will he try to not pay for her? Is the ex family going to push to be involved? Be there for the birth?", "NTA. He has no right to know the gender beforehand. Neither does anyone in his family. Keep this AH as far away from your birthing experience as possible.", "NTA. I get this weird vibe that they might try to take the baby away from you if it's a boy", "**NTA.**  Make sure your doctor's office knows about this so they can shut him down. You don't have an ultrasound at every appointment and sometimes the baby is not in a position so they can tell.", "NTA. Talk to your medical office ASAP about the info they release. Legally they shouldn't be giving it to anyone but you, but if he's a smooth talker he may try to play the nurses/staff over the phone (saw a relative do this and had it work). If you don't want him involved, don't let him. Start looking into the legal side of things now, so custody and support won't be a nasty issue later.", "NTA, and it might be time to go low contact. Think about this: His family is only interested if you give them a son to \"carry on the family name\" (I would recommend giving your baby your last name). If you have a daughter, they will lose all interest again, or treat her as less than. If you have a son, the toxic misogyny they will likely pass on sets off my warning bells. There are all sorts of ways that can mess up either gender of a child.\n\nBottom line, he has no rights (or responsibilities) until the baby is born, and that includes finding out the gender behind your back. So long as you are carrying the baby, they are a part of your body, and your choice.", "NTA.\n\nSounds sus.

Your baby, your choice. \n\nBesides, we get so few happy surprises in life, anyway. This should\u2019ve been one of them.", "NTA. this seems to me like if you have a boy they might try to get your ex to try to get custody of him. and if you have a girl, then it seems they don\u2019t want any part of that which means that family shouldn\u2019t be involved in any way if they\u2019re not going to love the child no matter the gender.", "NTA. You are growing the baby inside your body, not him. You get to decide. And if not finding out is important to you, anyone else finding out risks them passing that information on to you, intentionally or otherwise.", "NTA\n\nDo you need his money? If not necessarily, just tell him its a girl. Maybe he'll drop off the face of the earth", "He can sit on an egg and wait for it to hatch. Ignore him.
