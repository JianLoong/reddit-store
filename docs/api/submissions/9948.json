He had two kids as well, a boy that was 3 years older than me and a daughter that was 2 years younger, and he always treated them better than he treated me. My mom was a stay at home mom and never worked. He held the fact that he saved us from poverty over our heads.\n\nThings didn't get really bad though until my half-brother was born. He's 8 years younger than me, and I think he was part of the reason why they got married in the first place. When he turned 3, they moved him into my room, and then when he was 6, they (really my stepfather) decided he deserved his own room, so he took my room and I started living out of the living room. I slept on the couch and all of my clothes were stuffed into a coat closet. Any clothes that didn't fit in the tiny closet were donated away. Then when I turned 16, my stepdad demanded I get a job and start paying rent. My older stepbrother was taking a gap year before college, and didn't have to do that. The only one that was at all decent was my stepsister who even begged her dad to let me stay in her room. He refused, which I don't blame her for because it would definitely be inappropriate for a 17 year old boy to share a room with a 16 year old girl.\n\nWhen I graduated from high school, my stepfather told me that he would not be paying for my college. A year before he had agreed to pay for my stepbrothers college entirely. I was able to get a few scholarships and loans to pay for college, as well as the money I'd saved from working. I had enough for the first year, so I left.\n\nI met my now wife in my first year, and she's the only reason I'm where I am today. Her parents were also wonderful, and after our first year, they took me into their own home, and then helped me pay for the rest of college. Her dad helped me get my first job, and even invested in my business at the beginning. My business has really grown since then, and I've become very wealthy.\n\nMy stepbrother ended up getting a girl pregnant in his third year of college, dropped out, and now still lives with my stepfather and mom with his now wife and three kids. Since I still need to see my mom, my wife and I purchased two houses in my hometown. We rent out one and use the other whenever I go visit. Well, the last few years have been really bad for my stepdad. He had to close down his business over COVID, and some other things happened so they're flat broke now. They need to sell the house to cover their debts. My mom knows about the house I own, and asked me if they could move in. I told her that she can, but my stepfather and stepbrother's family can't. My mom was very upset about this, my stepfather called me a lot of names, but mainly just ungrateful and heartless. My wife thinks that I should just agree since it would be hard on my mom to be away from her husband and I'm making my stepbrother and his family homeless.

This was just shitty parenting to me.\n\nAnd now she's asking you to GIFT them all a house.

He made his bed, guess he should lay in it.", "NTA but your Mum stood by while all this happened, man. I wouldn't have bothered saying she could move in, even, because that just confuses the issue and makes you seem like a bit of a small man. In your shoes, I'd either give the pair of them the whole nine yards about all they put you through, and then either let them stay there, with yourself firmly on the moral high ground, or don't let them stay and reap your revenge.

She allowed him to abuse you. \n\nFirst, there are 4 adults in that home. 4 adults should be able too pool money and get an apartment. You can cover you Mom\u2019s 1/4 and let the other three figure out the remaining 3/4.\n\nSecond, you don\u2019t have to be the financial fall guy for people that have been cruel to you. You don\u2019t owe the steps anything. You don\u2019t even owe Mom as she allowed the abuse. \n\nThird, the sense of entitlement coming from Mom and Step is absolutely ridiculous. Everything you have, you and your wife built. They literally gave away your close and put you out with nothing. Yet somehow Step is going to call you names when you don\u2019t give him a home that he didn\u2019t provide for you as a child. \n\nFourth, never feel bad for cutting toxic people out of your life. Go to therapy if you haven\u2019t or if you need to heal yourself.

He probably wouldn't expect to pay you rent then you would have to evict them. You could let them stay there if they will sign and follow a strick lease and pay market value rent. That can be the compromise.", "NTA. \n\nFirst, you need to be clear with your wife that your stepdad abused you, and your mom let it happen. Kicking you out of your room, giving away your belongings, and making it clear you weren't really considered part of the family is abusive. People who don't have awful relationships with family sometimes cannot process how bad these situations are. Dealing with your stepdad brings up real feelings of being abandoned and basically left to die- be honest with your wife that how you were treated was to be left literally in the streets, where no one was there to help you. That is what this man did to you. \n\nSecond, if you did let your mom in that home, realize that stepdad and stepbrother will be there anyway, so don't do it. It's not worth the emotional or legal headache of letting your mom stay in the home, because she will just move them in and you'll have to deal with it, and it doesn't sound like your wife would really be helpful to you if you tried to kick them out. \n\nThird, you need to realize your mom is just as much to blame as your stepdad for what happened to you. Neither of them deserve your time, your money, or your emotions. You should consider going to a few therapy sessions, particularly as a way to express to your wife the anger and hurt your mom and stepfather caused you. \n\nFinally, take care of yourself. Congratulations on all you have accomplished and for making it through a really tough situation, which is an understatement. You deserve to be loved and happy, and I know I've been a bit hard on your wife here, but I'm glad you found a chosen family, her especially. Do not let your mother, or your stepdad, take up space in your life.

Games are unnecessary.", "NTA do not let them stay in your house, it will be like inviting termites in! Also, your mother never stood up for you, she is not innocent in all this, did she ever apologize for the treatment she allowed you to receive? truly you are being extremely forgiving, if I were you, I would have   severed all ties with her.", "NTA. Actions have consequences .... Step dad wanted to be an Ass to him growing up and tarnished any possible good relationship.

Give her a hand up, as your in-laws gave you.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your stepsister might have been the only one that considered you family, even including your mom.

But you had to know offering the house only to your mother would cause drama.", "NTA\n\nThere are multiple adults in their household capable of earning an income.  They need to sell their house, get jobs, and pay rent somewhere.  \n\nI would not suggest your mother move in on her own.

To be clear, don't write anyone a check except the insurance or medical provider. \n\nI understand your desire to be both helpful but maintain boundaries.", "YTA \n\nNot for not wanting your stepdad or stepbrother there (that\u2019s understandable) but for offering at all when that would be the condition. \n\nYou knew full well that she wasn\u2019t just going to abandon her family and live alone in your house so you only did that to make a point.", "Soft YTA for offering your mother an arrangement that you knew she couldn\u2019t take.\n\nAt BEST they sign a rental agreement and pay market value.\n\nand that\u2019s basically being nice to your mother. Her family, they are a commercial arrangement. They wanna rent the house, it\u2019s on the market.\n\nBut they don\u2019t get to play the family card on you for special treatment. That ship sailed years ago.", "Are you in your full right to decide who lives on your property? Yes.\n\nWill you be perceived as an asshole for asking your mother to chose between home and family? Also yes.\n\nWhile your biological family fully deserves what\u2019s befallen them, your behavior makes you YTA.", "Double assholes. You're turning into the person you despised.", "Yeah, kind of.\n\nYour step father was a jerk to you growing up, I get it. But by allowing your Mom to stay and no one else - you are breaking up her family. It's not helping her, or a real offer because she is not going to choose to live there alone.\n\nWhat I might do - is let them move in but not for free. Make them sign some sort of agreement. Especially step brother and his family. It doesn't have to be an insane amount, but at least some so they're not mooching off of you and taking advantage. Make sure the agreement covers all the necessary things, like who is responsible for upkeep, lawn mowing, utilities, etc.", "I don't really blame her. She was just doing what she had to do to survive. Plus, my life wasn't actually worse living in his house. When it was just me and my mom, we were living in a tiny studio apartment, sharing a bed with each other, and sharing a bathroom with two other families.", "Seriously this needs to be higher up!", "I just can\u2019t understand how a parent can stand by and let anyone hurt their child. Nothing is worth that.", "Ungrateful because he was the reason we had a house to live in and I was able to go to a good school.\n\nHeartless because I was forcing my stepbrother who has young children to be homeless. Also because the reason why they're struggling right now is due to my stepsister's illness and the pandemic. While the pandemic ruined his business, it made mine thrive.", "This!!\n\nLove is an incredible thing, because the fact that OP has any empathy for this woman at all it\u2019s a miracle to me. She sat by and watch as this man mistreated her child, and did nothing to change that. \n\n**And frankly she\u2019s just as bad as the stepdad for putting OP in the position to have to make this decision, then emotionally manipulating him by being sad that he won\u2019t allow people who hurt him to reap the benefits of his kindness.**\n\nBeing passive is not an excuse for allowing what she did.", "Nah...... He can sleep on the couch.", "Oh, I didn't make this clear, but the house in question isn't the house I live in. I live on the other side of the country. This is just an extra house that I own in my hometown where my mom and stepfather still live. They wouldn't be staying with me.", "Oh, I didn't make this clear, but the house in question isn't the house I live in. I live on the other side of the country.

She is well aware of everything my stepfather did, and she doesn't believe that we should have any sort of relationship with him. She has also expressed the sentiment that my mom is as much to blame, although I don't agree with that. My life was better in that house that it was out of it, and my mom knew that. She was doing what was best for her and for me.\n\nMy wife is also the type to believe that it's your duty as a person to help someone in need, no matter what. That's mainly where she's coming from.", "Second this completely", "Unfortunately, my stepsister passed away a little less than two years ago. She's always been sick, even when we were kids but she was able to get in under control. Then her illness came back in full force a few years ago, and when she got COVID, she was too weak to handle it. Her illness is part of the reason why my stepfather is so broke now, since he was paying for her medical expenses. I was also, actually, which is why I'm in more regular contact with them now. It was really hard on me because she was the only family that really cared for me.\n\nI don't really blame my half-brother. He treated me poorly because that's what he saw his dad and his brother doing. He actually reached out to me and apologized a few years ago because he grew up and realized that he had been so cruel. I did end up helping him when my stepdad cut him off for being gay and paid for the rest of his college.", "Yeah the answer should just be no", "My stepdad does have a job now, but they have a lot of medical debt from my stepsister's illness. My stepbrother and his wife also work, though only his wife works full-time. I don't actually know what he does for work, but it's some type of temp/contract work so it's not consistent.", "This would be stupid. The stepdad has no shame and would just call OP names and claim squatter\u2019s rights to make him impossible to evict. \n\nIt would start a brand new cycle of abuse.", "No I think you're confused about that second part", "I will admit, I didn't actually expect her to take me up on the offer, but I wasn't just trying to be petty to be petty. My wife and I can't stay in the house if my stepfather is there, so the offer was also so I'd still be able to see my mom since otherwise I'd have to get a hotel otherwise.", "OP is for sure on a power trip lol turning himself into the evil villain", "Seems to me like his mum chose long ago and decided against her family.", "OP will not be perceived as an asshole. They will claim to perceive him as an AH to put pressure on him. They can't wait to take over his house and his bedroom again.", "You do realize he didn't drag his mother in that house, right? He just told her that he will help her, but not the man who treated him like garbage.", "No. The stepfather treated his stepchild cruelly. Op just refuses to help someone who hurt him. Not the same thing at all. You will reap what you sow. If you treat people like garbage, it doesn't make them assholes for not saving you.", "He is not breaking up the family.  It will be her choice.   I would not let them in, virtually impossible to make them pay or leave", "He won't agree to pay rent. He kept telling me that I was ungrateful for not appreciating everything he did for me, providing me with a home and a chance to get an education. He also thinks I'm being heartless because the reason they're in debt is because of my stepsister's illness, which really stacked on medical costs.", "Her mom will if she chooses to leave. OP is not breaking anything up. Mom isn't innocent either. Just watched her son get treated like that. OP don't let your stepfather move in.", "\u201cdoing what she had to do to survive\u201d doesn\u2019t always translate into \u201cgood parenting.\u201d when you were younger, did you communicate with her that you felt mistreated hy your stepfather and did she attempt to rectify this? if not i dont see why she would be a priority either in this situation, you should leave them both in the dust.", "Except you had a BED. Sure you shared it, but it was a fucking bed. \n\nInstead your mother moved you into a home where *she* was better off, and you were treated like garbage. You were forced out of your room, for her new child, and made to sleep on a couch for years. \n\nYou just cannot convince me she had no other option, and that living with this man and being treated like an unwanted pest, was somehow better than living in a studio apartment.", "I would like to know if she got Social Security or state benefits when her husband died.", "She did everything to keep her head out of the water\u2026 she let you drown!", "You have to be careful though.

Their household has 4 able bodied adults (and 1 sickly one? Step sister was/is sick): healthy stepdad, mom, step brother, and his wife. Are all of them working full time or at least trying? Were all of them working full time during the hiring boom of 2021??\n\nNo? I\u2019m sorry to hear their financial stability wasn\u2019t a priority. That doesn\u2019t mean you owe them free housing. Whatever life lesson he was trying to teach you by charging you rent as a minor is a lesson he should learn now.", "Oh yeah, I understood that. Jeez, man, I wouldn't recommend they stay WITH you under any circumstances! I think my Irish syntax may have made it sound like I said \"stay there with you\" but what I meant was \"stay there, with you on the high ground\" meaning \"Let them stay, and in doing so, firmly place yourself on the moral high ground\".", "Oh, no, I got that! I was just thinking you could bring it up every time you phone your mom (you know, to make sure he's sleeping in the living room). Good heavens, if she was asking to move IN with you after everything that happened, I'd assume she was cracked.\n\nBasically, I'm advocating that you should be as petty as humanly possible.", "Your step sister deserves help as she tried to help you, and perhaps your half brother, who is too young to have been a party to the mean ness. So if your mom gets help, so should they. \n\nBut kicking stepfather and step brother to the curb - go for it!", "You can say that you mom only \u201cdid what\u2019s best for us\u201d all you want, but she\u2019s still with him today.

And seeing as mom is still there, and life in that house hasn\u2019t been going good for a while, I think we can assume it\u2019s the latter.\n\nYou need to pull your head out the sand. Your mom is selfish. She puts your stepfather above you. And it\u2019s blatant. She allowed him to treat you like trash for years, and now asks you to house him. *EVERYTHING* is done at YOUR detriment, and THEIR benefit. They don\u2019t fucking care about you, dude.", "Off topic, but I want to know moms reaction at your half brother being cut off.

That's the only thing about this that make you slightly the A.H. here. Your mom is just as guilty as your step-dad if she is letting that happen. There are other ways to survive than letting a spouse do this to your kids. \n\nOtherwise, NTA, but seriously consider going NC with them. As it stands, you are just enabling your mom by not letting her feel the full brunt of her actions.", "It strikes me that you don't really talk about your mom much... was she just there and doing her best for you but also afraid of challenging uour abusive stepdad? \n\nIt sounds to me like you're struggling... wanting to care for your mother while refusing to be guilted into doing a massive favour for your other step-family members who have been very cruel to you. \n\nIf your mother pushes, maybe you should see her ... just the two of you and talk her these things. Have a proper heart to heart about how poorly you felt you were treated.\n\nUltimately,  if you don't let them live there you're NTA. Your stepdad sounds like a massive asshole who taught your step bro that he was entitled to special treatment and it backfired,  obviously. \n\nIf you do decide to acquiesce to them living there, i would never do it before airing out the pile of dirty laundry.", "Oh yeah, it\u2019s the stepbrother\u2019s new wife I guess?", "For not wanting to help the people who were shitty to him all his childhood?", "hey ill pay to watch that show anytime. those are usually the best.", "Why??

I was banned from using my stepbrother's things, and he had a PS2 in the living room. Since I was sleeping in there, I decided to play on it at night so no one would know. Well, my stepdad caught me and blew up. I told my mom it wasn't fair because he wouldn't have even known I was using it. She just old me that it was the rules.\n\nI did go low contact for a few years, but my stepsister got really sick a few years ago so I decided to get involved again.", "I was also able to go to a much better school than the one I would've otherwise went to. The school in my stepfather's area was not only one of the best in the area, but it was one of the best in that region of the country.

Perhaps your mother and step-brother might have to (shock, horror) get a job!!\n\nAlso, your mother *actively saw you being abused* and decided her living conditions were worth the trade off.
