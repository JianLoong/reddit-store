He had two kids as well, a boy that was 3 years older than me and a daughter that was 2 years younger, and he always treated them better than he treated me. My mom was a stay at home mom and never worked. He held the fact that he saved us from poverty over our heads.\n\nThings didn't get really bad though until my half-brother was born. He's 8 years younger than me, and I think he was part of the reason why they got married in the first place. When he turned 3, they moved him into my room, and then when he was 6, they (really my stepfather) decided he deserved his own room, so he took my room and I started living out of the living room. I slept on the couch and all of my clothes were stuffed into a coat closet. Any clothes that didn't fit in the tiny closet were donated away. Then when I turned 16, my stepdad demanded I get a job and start paying rent. My older stepbrother was taking a gap year before college, and didn't have to do that. The only one that was at all decent was my stepsister who even begged her dad to let me stay in her room. He refused, which I don't blame her for because it would definitely be inappropriate for a 17 year old boy to share a room with a 16 year old girl.\n\nWhen I graduated from high school, my stepfather told me that he would not be paying for my college. A year before he had agreed to pay for my stepbrothers college entirely. I was able to get a few scholarships and loans to pay for college, as well as the money I'd saved from working. I had enough for the first year, so I left.\n\nI met my now wife in my first year, and she's the only reason I'm where I am today. Her parents were also wonderful, and after our first year, they took me into their own home, and then helped me pay for the rest of college. Her dad helped me get my first job, and even invested in my business at the beginning. My business has really grown since then, and I've become very wealthy.\n\nMy stepbrother ended up getting a girl pregnant in his third year of college, dropped out, and now still lives with my stepfather and mom with his now wife and three kids. Since I still need to see my mom, my wife and I purchased two houses in my hometown. We rent out one and use the other whenever I go visit. Well, the last few years have been really bad for my stepdad. He had to close down his business over COVID, and some other things happened so they're flat broke now. They need to sell the house to cover their debts. My mom knows about the house I own, and asked me if they could move in. I told her that she can, but my stepfather and stepbrother's family can't. My mom was very upset about this, my stepfather called me a lot of names, but mainly just ungrateful and heartless. My wife thinks that I should just agree since it would be hard on my mom to be away from her husband and I'm making my stepbrother and his family homeless.

This was just shitty parenting to me.\n\nAnd now she's asking you to GIFT them all a house.

He made his bed, guess he should lay in it.", "NTA but your Mum stood by while all this happened, man. I wouldn't have bothered saying she could move in, even, because that just confuses the issue and makes you seem like a bit of a small man. In your shoes, I'd either give the pair of them the whole nine yards about all they put you through, and then either let them stay there, with yourself firmly on the moral high ground, or don't let them stay and reap your revenge.

She allowed him to abuse you. \n\nFirst, there are 4 adults in that home. 4 adults should be able too pool money and get an apartment. You can cover you Mom\u2019s 1/4 and let the other three figure out the remaining 3/4.\n\nSecond, you don\u2019t have to be the financial fall guy for people that have been cruel to you. You don\u2019t owe the steps anything. You don\u2019t even owe Mom as she allowed the abuse. \n\nThird, the sense of entitlement coming from Mom and Step is absolutely ridiculous. Everything you have, you and your wife built. They literally gave away your clothes and put you out with nothing. Yet somehow Step is going to call you names when you don\u2019t give him a home that he didn\u2019t provide for you as a child. \n\nFourth, never feel bad for cutting toxic people out of your life. Go to therapy if you haven\u2019t or if you need to heal yourself.

She allowed this man to treat you that way", "NTA, you are allowed to set the rules especially when treated poorly by them in the past. You do not owe them anything and if your mom didn't advocate for you in the past, you don't owe her either.", "NTA. You have been treated horribly. And make no mistake: your mother was part of this and didn't protect you the way she should have.", "NTA, but if you look at it in another point of view, you will be in charge now. that means you can tell him you expect him to be little more respectful considering what your doing for him.", "NTA though I\u2019d move in the stepdad, give him a coat closet for his clothes then donate anything that doesn\u2019t fit in it.

He probably wouldn't expect to pay you rent then you would have to evict them. You could let them stay there if they will sign and follow a strick lease and pay market value rent. That can be the compromise.", "NTA. \n\nFirst, you need to be clear with your wife that your stepdad abused you, and your mom let it happen. Kicking you out of your room, giving away your belongings, and making it clear you weren't really considered part of the family is abusive. People who don't have awful relationships with family sometimes cannot process how bad these situations are. Dealing with your stepdad brings up real feelings of being abandoned and basically left to die- be honest with your wife that how you were treated was to be left literally in the streets, where no one was there to help you. That is what this man did to you. \n\nSecond, if you did let your mom in that home, realize that stepdad and stepbrother will be there anyway, so don't do it. It's not worth the emotional or legal headache of letting your mom stay in the home, because she will just move them in and you'll have to deal with it, and it doesn't sound like your wife would really be helpful to you if you tried to kick them out. \n\nThird, you need to realize your mom is just as much to blame as your stepdad for what happened to you. Neither of them deserve your time, your money, or your emotions. You should consider going to a few therapy sessions, particularly as a way to express to your wife the anger and hurt your mom and stepfather caused you. \n\nFinally, take care of yourself. Congratulations on all you have accomplished and for making it through a really tough situation, which is an understatement. You deserve to be loved and happy, and I know I've been a bit hard on your wife here, but I'm glad you found a chosen family, her especially. Do not let your mother, or your stepdad, take up space in your life.

Games are unnecessary.", "NTA do not let them stay in your house, it will be like inviting termites in! Also, your mother never stood up for you, she is not innocent in all this, did she ever apologize for the treatment she allowed you to receive? truly you are being extremely forgiving, if I were you, I would have   severed all ties with her.", "NTA. Actions have consequences .... Step dad wanted to be an Ass to him growing up and tarnished any possible good relationship.

You **SHOULD help** her and have no reason to not help him!

Give her a hand up, as your in-laws gave you.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your stepsister might have been the only one that considered you family, even including your mom.

But you had to know offering the house only to your mother would cause drama.", "NTA\n\nThere are multiple adults in their household capable of earning an income.  They need to sell their house, get jobs, and pay rent somewhere.  \n\nI would not suggest your mother move in on her own.

DO NOT BEND because you will regret it and then if things go bad once they\u2019ve moved in you will have to go to court and it takes month for them to be kick out.\n\nAlso I know you don\u2019t want to believe it but your mom was wrong for allowing her son to go thru all of that.

A good parent doesn't allow ANYONE to treat their child in the manner she allowed your stepfather to do. That's why people are saying to let them fend for themselves. The fact that so many people see it and you are acting defensive about it shows the lack of value you place upon yourself. I implore you to see therapy because what you went through isn't normal, and a parent should never have allowed the type of abuse you went through.
