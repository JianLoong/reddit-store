And also I will get to see my sibling which wouldnt have happened if I was in the hospital the whole time.  I\u2019m very relieved\n\nMy sibling who lives outside the country decided to schedule their first visit home in five years the same weekend as my scheduled C-section.  My parents said it was a wonderful idea. \nI flipped out because my parents are supposed to stay at my house and watch my older child. I do not want my child being taken to see visitors while I\u2019m in the hospital and I also do not want a party at my house while I am in the hospital.\nMy sibling is expecting to see various extended family members and be with my parents the whole time, so basically I need to hire help for the duration of my hospital stay or allow my child to be brought to parties without me possibly while I am in surgery or allow the party to be at my house!\nAdditionally, my parents were supposed to sleep at my house. So now I am expected to have my sibling sleep here too and I don\u2019t even have room.\nAdd to this, my parents and sibling are notoriously messy. They will not do dishes or clean up after themselves. I really don\u2019t want to come home to a huge mess. \nMy parents are mad at me for not being okay with a party at my house or with them driving my child all over the place visiting random people while I\u2019m in the hospital. \nAita for putting my foot down and saying no?\n\nETA:  my hospital stay will be two nights. My siblings stay will be two nights. It overlaps 100% with surgery and hospital recovery and just seems ridiculous to me that my parents won\u2019t say how about a different couple of days.\n\nEta two:  I am nine months pregnant so this is imminent. My ability to actually hire help for multiple overnights etc is pretty limited at this point and I don\u2019t think I will be able to unless it was a complete stranger which I\u2019m also not comfortable with.

On a normal day, would they be allowed to take their grandchild to visit another family member or to the park or library or wherever?\n\nIt seems like there is some information missing about why you can\u2019t or don\u2019t trust your child to be outside of your home with them. If that\u2019s the case, I personally wouldn\u2019t trust them at all to be babysitting.", "I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re just not in the position to dictate anything. You want their help. You have to find a way to make it work, considering the changed circumstances. You can be unhappy about the situation, but that won\u2019t change a thing. Just talk and find a compromise. Let your sister stay and make rules regarding cleanliness. Let your parents drive and make sure they do so with normal safety guards in place. Let them all stay at your parents\u2019. This can be easily solved. You need to solve this and focus on your pregnancy.", "Just oblivious I think :/", "So if your sibling were to agree to drive?", "They have seen my sibling by visiting there. Including within the past few months. It\u2019s just my siblings first visit here in years.", "And I am willing for husband to stay home and he will\u2026 I\u2019ll only be in the hospital for a couple days (knock wood) so we are not talking a long period of time here", "And no there is no chance of my sibling sleeping elsewhere because my parents wouldn\u2019t have it. I", "My parents have seen my sibling multiple times in the past few years including twice in the past year. This is just my siblings first time coming here in years. \n\nI actually already have extra help lined up! My parents were supposed to be my on-call for watching my older one when I was in the hospital and I have a hired individual lined up to stay twenty four hours a day for a couple weeks for when I can come home. All of this I arranged many months ago.\n\nMy sibling does not have a particular reason to come on these days. They just felt like an impromptu visit.\n\nDo you have children? Just curious because I travel for my job and I require overnight childcare often enough to know that it is really not that easy to find quality reliable childcare to stay overnight for for days at a time without much advance notice.  And as I mentioned I have someone lined up to do just this once I am home from the hospital.", "Yeah but that's still shitty on your partner's part. He shouldn't say \"Oh it'll be fine, your just going to pop out that baby early\" instead of \"we need to give your sister some recommendations for hotels\".", "No they have seen my sibling multiple times in the past few years by visiting there.  I\u2019m fact the last visit was a few months again This is just siblings first visit here in a while. \n\nAlso of course they could technically stay at a hotel or someone else\u2019s house, but my parents will not have it.", "For my surgery, and my mental health during the surgery, I really just need to know that my child is safe at home. I don\u2019t want to wonder whose house they are at or on what highway. Yes I am away from my kid for hours pretty much every day but for this one day that I\u2019m having major surgery, I want to know they are home.", "Really, the person that secured a commitment 9 months ago can't dictate anything?", "for my mental health no, I just can\u2019t be in the middle of major surgery not knowing my child is safe at home.  And they cannot all stay at my parents that is not an option.", "Oh no that would be much worse!  They don\u2019t have a license to drive here", "Where would your sibling have stayed if they showed up outside the dates of your surgery? If your parents don\u2019t have room to house your sibling, would you be expected to let them crash at your place?", "Right? \"Who cares about preparing for the best case scenario because I'm basically certain it's going to be the worst case\" is a shitty and extremely unhelpful attitude to take. Especially since your partner either can't, or can't be assed, to take care of your older kid while you recover so he *needs* to help you figure it the fuck out.", "I am full time working mother. I have had daycare, nannies, etc. it is not an issue of leaving my child in general, it\u2019s for this one day I want to have no worries or thoughts except for what is happening in the operating room", "Well, then your husband needs to stay home with your older child. It sounds like your sibling is coming regardless, and you say it\u2019s too late to secure other childcare. You can be upset at your parents for changing plans all you want, but the plans *are* changing. If you aren\u2019t willing to compromise at all, you\u2019re left with your husband staying home now, at least overnight. He can bring your older child to the hospital with him during your actual surgery. It\u2019s definitely not ideal, but if you need to know exactly where she is, she\u2019ll be there with your spouse.", "Why?", "Eh\u2026 No. How would she do that? It sucks and it\u2019s unfair, but she\u2019s not in the position to change the situation. OP can be unhappy about it all she wants, but that won\u2019t make her sister go away. She\u2019s simple not in the position to make demands. She can try, but do you really think her parents will decide to refrain from seeing their daughter, they haven\u2019t seen in five years? It might be unfair but OP has no choice but to compromise.", "I don\u2019t expect to always dictate free childcare. But it\u2019s been arranged for months, and now with two weeks to go they are changing the terms on me when it\u2019s too late for me to arrange an alternative.", "Why do you think your kid isn\u2019t safe when they\u2019re visiting family? Is there any history justifying that fear?", "Children are not allowed in the hospital so that is not an option. My husband can stay home but then I will need to do the surgery on my own.", "They have seen my sibling multiple times in five years including twice in the past year. This is just the first visit here", "I\u2019m not disagreeing with you that it\u2019s unfortunate, but it sounds like she\u2019s coming either way. Now that the situation is there, you need to solve it. You can decide to just be unhappy about it, but that won\u2019t make your sister go away\u2026", "Seems like your only option is to have your partner stay home and you have the surgery alone. May not be ideal, but in the long term, seems like the best option.  \n\nOther possibilities have your kid off who-knows-where with people you don\u2019t trust to drive, coming home to a trashed house, coming home to a week long party in progress or coming home and having to entertain uninvited houseguests while trying to recover.  \nFirst option, the inconvenience is only for the length of your surgery, and at least you\u2019ll have peace of mind knowing your kid is being looked after.", "Do not do the surgery alone.\nI've had two c-sections and both times it took a while before I was well enough to see my child. Dit those first few hours your child needs a parent to bond with. I really hope your c-section goes smoothly and your child can stay with you, but if not then the dad needs to be there to bond and make medically necessary decisions.", "Okay, but you said your husband thought you were going to go into labor early anyways. Are your parents just on standby to babysit if that happens? Because if not, presumably your husband would be staying with your other child regardless since they aren\u2019t allowed at the hospital.", "Yes my parents agreed to be on standby. It was always the plan they would come as needed."]}
