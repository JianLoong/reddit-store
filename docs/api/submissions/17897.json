You didn't agree to pay for them, you agreed on a weekend couple's getaway. It seems like he keeps shifting the goalposts on how much you should be paying for things, and what's more it sounds like he has a fairly \"What's mine is mine\" mentality. You paying the same despite your smaller income so he can save to buy you both a house? What? Why not have both of you pay and save based on your incomes, and then you both buy the house together?\n\nOne comment said he plans to not put your name on the house, and honestly that sounds like it might be what's going on. I would say to ask him about that if you trust him, but honestly it seems like he's just telling you the part of the truth that he wants you to hear.\n\nThese are mostly educated speculations, so I would suggest that you do have a serious talk with him about what's going on, and make sure to stay alert and keep mental note of what might sound like half-truths. Especially because saving for a house without your partner contributing sounds like he's gearing up in case you two split, and getting you to foot the bill for him to do so. But again, these are mostly just educated speculations.\n\n*It's unclear whether you two are married, since as one commenter mentioned you refer to him as partner, but his family as your in-laws.
