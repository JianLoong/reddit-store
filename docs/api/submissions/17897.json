Your portion of that vacation bill is 15%.  \n\n\nBut - you're not married, from your use of the word \"partner\"? - You need to have a formal, thorough, written expenses plan for your household expenses, which accurately reflects his paying for his children to stay in your shared home, as well as balanced towards who earns more.   \n\n\nWho will own the house, he or you?

You didn't agree to pay for them, you agreed on a weekend couple's getaway. It seems like he keeps shifting the goalposts on how much you should be paying for things, and what's more it sounds like he has a fairly \"What's mine is mine\" mentality. You paying the same despite your smaller income so he can save to buy you both a house? What? Why not have both of you pay and save based on your incomes, and then you both buy the house together?\n\nOne comment said he plans to not put your name on the house, and honestly that sounds like it might be what's going on. I would say to ask him about that if you trust him, but honestly it seems like he's just telling you the part of the truth that he wants you to hear.\n\nThese are mostly educated speculations, so I would suggest that you do have a serious talk with him about what's going on, and make sure to stay alert and keep mental note of what might sound like half-truths. Especially because saving for a house without your partner contributing sounds like he's gearing up in case you two split, and getting you to foot the bill for him to do so. But again, these are mostly just educated speculations.\n\n*It's unclear whether you two are married, since as one commenter mentioned you refer to him as partner, but his family as your in-laws.

Why is that?", "But if you break up you could afford it on your own. So why accept his behaviour? He\u2019s mooching.\n\nAlso, how are you moving on the property ladder if he buys a house? How are you supposed to pay for share if you cannot save? I guarantee you 100% this type of guy won\u2019t put your name on the deed. You\u2019re being used. You have a way bigger problem than this vacation.", "So before he moved in, you lived by yourself in a house big enough for 4 people? I think you need /r/personalfinance more than this sub.", ">You are super invested in making OP responsible for this guy's leeching. Why is that?\n  \nI'm not. I'm pointing out that OP is wholly responsible for the situation they find themselves in, and is making excuses for why they haven't enacted any actual changes.", "OP is not even slightly responsible for the leech's behavior.  But making women responsible for terrible men is a time-honored bit of misogyny so I guess you've made yourself clear."]}
