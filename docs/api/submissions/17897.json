Your portion of that vacation bill is 15%.  \n\n\nBut - you're not married, from your use of the word \"partner\"? - You need to have a formal, thorough, written expenses plan for your household expenses, which accurately reflects his paying for his children to stay in your shared home, as well as balanced towards who earns more.   \n\n\nWho will own the house, he or you?

You didn't agree to pay for them, you agreed on a weekend couple's getaway. It seems like he keeps shifting the goalposts on how much you should be paying for things, and what's more it sounds like he has a fairly \"What's mine is mine\" mentality. You paying the same despite your smaller income so he can save to buy you both a house? What? Why not have both of you pay and save based on your incomes, and then you both buy the house together?\n\nOne comment said he plans to not put your name on the house, and honestly that sounds like it might be what's going on. I would say to ask him about that if you trust him, but honestly it seems like he's just telling you the part of the truth that he wants you to hear.\n\nThese are mostly educated speculations, so I would suggest that you do have a serious talk with him about what's going on, and make sure to stay alert and keep mental note of what might sound like half-truths. Especially because saving for a house without your partner contributing sounds like he's gearing up in case you two split, and getting you to foot the bill for him to do so. But again, these are mostly just educated speculations.\n\n*It's unclear whether you two are married, since as one commenter mentioned you refer to him as partner, but his family as your in-laws.

You can\u2019t help anyone if you are passing out from oxygen deprivation and, ultimately, the children won\u2019t be any better off when you pass out, just because you took the time to save them first.

I am sending you a big hug, you deserve to be truly loved and taken care of, not emotionally scammed or financially abused.", "There\u2019s a lot to address here, so let\u2019s go through one by one:\n\n1. Household bills. He should pay proportionally for the uplift in costs that his children incur, certainly seeing as you are not the main wage earner. I concur with your calculation of around a minimum of 16k over 4 years based on him having the children 50% of the time, however it\u2019s clearly unreasonable to expect a back  payment, but certainly use this as leverage to remediate the current imbalance. How often are the children with you?  I got the impression he\u2019s not got custody of them 50/50 with his ex wife? Whatever the case calculating his contribution to bills, rent, food based on the proportion of time they\u2019re with you is fair. \n\n2. Following on from above, if he doesn\u2019t have 50/50 custody, is he still paying towards his ex wife for the care of the children? You said he earns 65% of the household income, is that taking into account any payments for child support to his ex? ( I\u2019ve got a friend who is battling for 50% custody with his ex but until then has to pay 35% of his income to the ex even tho she has the kids just one day extra a week - and his ex has a high paid job as a commercial lawyer). Quite possibly this might be why he\u2019s looking to buy a place close so he can have 50/50 custody?\n\n3. If you\u2019re saving towards a house together with your partner that you will both own then you should have a joint savings account, you need to discuss this asap I suggest. If this is somehow \u201chis\u201d house but not yours,  then you need to be very clear about what you\u2019re going to contribute to it. However, whether or not you end up with a property owned together is entirely unrelated to his obligations to pay his way now while you\u2019re in rented accommodation.\n\n4. The AirBnB holiday. Sounds like you rented an entire property that could accommodate 7 people? Often there will be a minimum cost even if just the two of you were to rent it, so my suggestion is you work out the difference between the cost of that property for an occupancy of two and an occupancy of 7 and your partner pays the difference. This might mean 15% for you, it might mean more, but I think this is fair - unless of course you would have rented something entirely different had it just been the two of you? In which case a proportional cost is appropriate as you have suggested.\n\n5. Relationship. I cannot comment on this except to say clearly the current financial situation is taking a toll on your relationship, so you need to reach a consensus for the current rental situation  and an agreement for the future house should you decide to stay together.", "You\u2019re subsidizing his living, his family, his savings, and his eventual home ownership (that probably won\u2019t include you); you clean up after him and care for his children, and he essentially conned you into paying for a walk down memory lane vacation for his family.

UGH. no one else will stand up for you, except for you. remember how it felt to be in control of your own money and making your own budgeting choices rather than being dragged down by someone else's plans. remember how much less work it was to just take care of yourself and your own messes. start saving up, put a little less into the joint accounts, start making a plan for how to disentangle.", "Have you heard of the expression \"love isn't enough\"  well your relationship is lacking many things including: respect, equality and accountability (from him) but you are putting up with it because you love him. \n\nTo start he should be paying at least 75% of everything considering that he has a whole package while you are just one person.

He's saving HIS money for HIS move to be closer to HIS kids and buy HIS house. Where do you come in in any of that? What about your financial needs and goals? He doesn't care, does he?

He\u2019s actually keeping her from owning property but being cheap and guilting her into paying way more than her share to be a bangmaid/nanny for his kids \n\nAnd his kids see that he has no respect for her and likely will soon treat her and their spouses like garbage because it seems normal", "And plenty of others don't.

Same thing with being judged for putting up with him.\n\nIt's easy to fall in to this mindset that things might look bad but there's some unexplainable things going on that make your situation exceptional, but it's really not and you'll see that once you're out on the other side emotionally.\n\nIf you could send a message back to past you, would you warn yourself away from this relationship or keep quiet about it to let it happen?
