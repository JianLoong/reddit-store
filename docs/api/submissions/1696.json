When I questioned her on that she got defensive. Students don't pay rent. They don't sign a lease and they don't have renter's rights. They pay fees to the university and have to follow certain rules. OP would know all of that if they really did live in a dorm.", "I did not check where OP is from but you do realize that there are other places besides the US? Because where I live, college/university students absolutely do pay rent, have renter's rights and a lease even when living in a dorm.", "That's what I first asked her. And she did not respond that they pay rent and sign a lease. She responded \"well yeah dorms aren't free\". I was trying to gather the info if they do have renter's rights then they have the right to use their apartment how they want. So do you have renter's rights or do you have to follow dorm rules? Maybe you can answer since OP won't.", "Well yeah dorms aren't free", "You do know that at many colleges, you pay to be in the dorms too, right?", "You pay fees to the college or university to live in a dorm. That comes with rules students must follow. That's not the same as rent at all. There are laws that protect renters. Renters usually sign a lease and have to abide by those restrictions. They have rights attached to that. No, you don't pay rent to live in a dorm."]}
