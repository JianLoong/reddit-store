Wait? What?   You can just wear earplugs, right?  Not like we are not doing normal everyday things bro.", "NTA and also WTF? Are they on the lease? Cause I know how I\u2019d deal with it.", "I don't think a determination can be made until the living situation is clarified by OP. Is this a university dorm, student housing or an apartment with a landlord?", "I did not check where OP is from but you do realize that there are other places besides the US? Because where I live, college/university students absolutely do pay rent, have renter's rights and a lease even when living in a dorm.", "That's what I first asked her. And she did not respond that they pay rent and sign a lease. She responded \"well yeah dorms aren't free\". I was trying to gather the info if they do have renter's rights then they have the right to use their apartment how they want. So do you have renter's rights or do you have to follow dorm rules? Maybe you can answer since OP won't.", "Well yeah dorms aren't free", "You do know that at many colleges, you pay to be in the dorms too, right?", "You pay fees to the college or university to live in a dorm. That comes with rules students must follow. That's not the same as rent at all. There are laws that protect renters. Renters usually sign a lease and have to abide by those restrictions. They have rights attached to that. No, you don't pay rent to live in a dorm.", "Countries other than the US exist (and even in the US Im not sure it's that homogeneous). Dorms are rarely free, and sometimes aren't even owned by the university, they're just privately-owned buildings setup and marketed as dorms. You sign leases because, well, you're tenants. Probably there's no RA equivalent, just a kind of building manager, or at least that's how it works in a couple countries I'm familiar with. Some other cultures also don't have the immediate 'run to a person of authority to fix everything' instinct \u2013 often because those authorities are unreliable \u2013 so running to the RA/teacher/mom isn't often considered the best solution.\n\nThat said, the post still sounds really weird based on the kids' behaviour, who does that.", "Actually, in many larger cities in the US, colleges utilize \"privatized\" dorms. My child was boarded in one in Chicago; we paid rent.", "No, not all of know that we can or even can go to the RA. My freshman RA did it for the money and was literally gone every day of the week from 7am-9pm. Can't tell the RA when the RA isn't there.", "In the US students absolutely also pay rent, sign a lease, etc., etc. In fact, it's pretty common.", "A privatized dorm \u2260 a dorm though. We have those here too and they're not called dorms anyways, just student housing.", "They don't for a dorm. They do for apartments. You don't have a lease or pay rent for a dorm. It's in your tuition price.", "Depends. I was surprised to find that a school near me does not have any standard dorms. But, rather contracts a third party apartment building to provide housing. They advertise it as a dorm and/or student housing interchangeably. No RA's and individual rental agreements on a per bedroom-type of basis.\n\nThen, I found it was becoming more common. Less liability for the school when a kid does something stupid. Like drinking underage, etc.", "Even for freshman? That's non standard I would say. Very strange to contract out housing for 18 years old and having no supervision. That's why there are RAs in typical dorms. To curb the underage drinking and craziness.", "Right?! But, yes. I first stumbled across them while looking for housing when moving half across the country. Then, got curious.", "This sounds like the start of a horror movie, but if it's actually real, NTA.", "I live in the UK, idk what an RA is. But I live in a university dorm and pay rent, and we have a signed lease.", "Norwegian students in student housing do pay rent, and the reps from the university housing company typically have offices on campus, which are only open during office hours.", "The rent part doesn't make sense, but turning to the RA might be useless. My last dorm room had a window out to a patio with a water fountain and tables that was only accessible from my neighbor's room. She'd sit right outside my window at 3-4 AM playing guitar with her boyfriend. I tried to ask her politely if she could stop doing this during the week because I had morning classes, and she just basically said no, not her problem. I finally went to the RA and the RA told me that she'd already received multiple reports about the girl, spoke to her, and realized the girl was not going to change her behavior so there was pretty much nothing she could do. Could the RA have done something? Probably. But they deal with a lot of dumb issues regularly and probably get burnt out after a while, particularly when their authority isn't respected.", "They\u2019re in the UK: it\u2019s totally different and largely unstaffed.", "It stands for Resident Advisor. There is usually an RD as well. That's a Resident Director. The RA is usually over a floor, the RD is over the entire building, or multiple buildings. There's also a Student Housing Director over everything. What terms are used in the UK?", "What I've come across in the US is that if they are campus dorms students sign a housing agreement. It's a contract between the university and student. There are rules that come along with that and usually quiet hours.\n\nIn the US rent is a legal term and leases give tenants rights in the courts. If there's a lease in place then co-tentants have to set up roommate agreements. Otherwise they can use their shared apartment any legal way they want. Including running around and knocking on each other's doors in the middle of the night.", "That's a frustrating situation. I'm sure the RA gets tired of dealing with so many issues. I wouldn't want that job. But they should have someone above them to help enforce rules, especially when there's multiple complaints.", "Yes, we're discussing further up.", "Ohhh okay that makes sense. We don't really have any support staff for specific floors (I have no idea if that's normal), there's just a few resident support staff for everyone in the dorms. \n\nI turned to them already but they basically told us to figure it out on our own and call campus security if it gets out of hand.", "We have a contract between us and the university. The contract does have rules about quiet hours but I've already complained to the resident support staff and they don't care lol.", "Not at most colleges/universities. Tuition only includes tuition.  On top of that you have required fees like heath fee, lab fee, books etc. Housing costs depends on where you live.  You can be off campus, you can do on campus.  There\u2019s also some housing available at fraternity or sorority houses on campus if you belong to one which has little to do with the university outside of them holding that over their heads to behave or else lose their house. \n\nIt\u2019s not a traditional lease when it\u2019s a dorm but you have to sign things and you pay per semester as opposed to per month.  And in my school they kicked you out of the dorms for winter break.  Your stuff could stay there, but unless you got special permission you did not get to stay with your stuff.  \n\nIn my school and all the public ones in my state they never had enough dorms/apartments on campus to give even every freshmen a space let alone everyone.  Now what they might do is lump it into your loan for that year if you are taking out student loans so you have less to pay upfront.", "No, you are incorrect. Tuition is a separate expense from room and board in the US. Many colleges here charge different amounts for accommodations depending on the type of dorm. And while there is usually no lease, there are written rules and expectations.", "It might be worth calling security nect time they are being loud, they often have a team who will come and talk to your flat mates and tell them to quiet down. Plus you then have the calls as a paper trail for if you complain to the office again.", "I would suggest a house meeting (all the roommates in the apartment sit down together). Then go over the issues. Set up a roommate agreement. It's a contract. If you've ever seen Big Bang Theory, Sheldon is big on these. Then you can make sure everyone is content with the living arrangements.", "That\u2019s normal for the UK - go to Student Services and university admin staff, they\u2019ll help. The support people should have talked to them but get paid uni staff involved and they\u2019ll sort it.", "That's really frustrating. See my other comment about how you all can proceed in a manner that will be satisfactory for everyone in the apartment.", "That\u2019s the norm in the U.K. Of course we\u2019re allowed to drink much younger so no need to be policed.", "In Norway, drinking age is 18. You finish upper secondary at 19. There is no \"freshman year\", you start the real studies right away and yes, you sign a lease and pay rent when living in a dormatory.", "Are you under the impression that \u201cfreshman\u201d students don\u2019t have real studies in the US?"]}
