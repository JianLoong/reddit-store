My dad would take his turns to cook some nights, but that's because I started to become increasingly clumsy and would burn myself frequently. We learnt soon this was because I had began to develop neurological issues as a result of stress and I also developed long term physical issues aswell.\n\nBefore long, my dad started to have a good half of the chores on his plate. He worked during the day while I went to college (we are in the UK) and in the evening we spent it completing some of the chores. I still completed half, however somedays it was difficult for me to manage anything at all. My dad was becoming increasingly stressed over having to do them, especially since he had not been doing the chores around the house for a good 8 years. All he was used to was going to work, going to bed for a nap, waking up for dinner then going to bed for the night.\n\nMy dad recently changed jobs, and found himself a new group of friends with it, mostly all parents. I learnt recently that by seeing a notification on his phone, that my dad (in what I assume is an attempt to fit in with them) has been talking badly about me in a group chat that they all have. I probably shouldn't have read the messages, but he left his phone open and curiosity got the better of me.\nHe went on to express how hard it is as a single father, and how I never do anything to help him. There were other messages saying that I as a teenager had a horrible attitude, and backchatted him often. With all of this, he failed to mention my disabilities or anything good about me at all.\n\nHe had recently began to complain to me about how little I do and got mad at me over small things. I found out he had started talking badly about me to family members too. I now knew where all this had come from, and I was so upset.\n\nWithout mentioning the GC, I told him that what he had been saying to me had hurt alot, and it hurt even more that he was lying about me to family that didn't know me well enough to know it wasn't true. I also expressed that I felt although he didn't appreciate me enough. He denied everything.\n\nThis is where I may be the asshole. I told him that until he apologised and stops lying about me and being rude, I refuse to do anything around the house.

As parents they would feel it's bizarre seeing how he is treating you and how he complains. He probably is omitting those things because he damn well knows it's not okay.\n\nBeing a single parent is hard, and its okay to have your kids do some chores. It's good even. But you should not run his household for him. You shouldn't be carrying the emotional labour at all.", "NTA at all. Your dad is stressed and not used to helping around the house but that is no excuse for his behaviour. He is the adult and the person responsible for the household. You are the child and should be helping which you have been doing for years. You have serious health issues that impact your abilities. Your dad should be bragging about you and so proud that you help as much as you can and still manage college. You are doing a remarkable job and he should appreciate you.\n\nHe is so totally wrong for talking about you and criticizing you ever. I'm glad you called him out on it and are waiting for him to apologize. I would also insist that he explains to everyone he talked to that he was wrong about what he said.\n\nFrom a Reddit mom, I'm so proud of you and would like to send you hugs.

It is truly horrifying that your father let it get this far.", "NTA - how hard is it for dad to apologize? Because you know what else causes stress? Being lied about and badmouthed by YOUR OWN FATHER. Tell him to deal with the disappointment in his life like a big boy and get therapy instead of projecting his frustrations onto you... and start saving to move out.", "NTA\nThis is why your stepmom left your dad lol", "Your dad is your parents and your his child, not a housekeeper. You've already been doing too many chores. An even split is the only fair option. In no way are you in the wrong. NTA", "NTA but choose your battles cause he can kick you out. my advice is try to keep your distance from him or move out. the fact that he isn\u2019t used to cooking and cleaning is the problem here. he needs to step up and clean and cook with you. you aren\u2019t his wife but both parties should be helping", "NTA. Sorry for your abusive upbringing.", "NTA. I've read this same story on Reddit at least a dozen times. Family exists where mom does everything. Sadly mom passed away. Eldest daughter is new mom that takes over everything. Dad doesn't do anything to help the situation because it's all the same for him. Daughter loses childhood.\n\nYou need to move out. He's going to keep putting you in the wife box because you're the female in the house.", "Nta", "NTA. Your dad is stressed at having to be an adult and clean up after himself, instead of others cleaning up after him for so long.    \nAnd yeah, you should also be helping out around the house, as you live there, too.", "Need info: op, how many house chores are we talking about here? Laundry and dishes, or were you deep cleaning the house?", "NTA and follow through.  If he thinks you are a terrible child, time for him to find out.  He has been babied this whole time and now he gets a plate full of unpleasantness.  Not only does he need to apologize to you but he needs to speak to all of those people he has badmouthed you to (with you present), explaining that he lied about you to make himself look better.  He did a terrible thing and really needs to work to make it up to you.", "If it really is the case that you previously did all the chores then I think, disability aside, you're more than entitled to a full break. NTA.", "YTA for reading his phone, as that is totally unacceptable! But definitely NTA for not holding up your end of the chores. You\u2019re still only a kid and now have neurological issues from stress! He needs to grow up and take on the responsibility a father should, and that includes keeping the house reasonable, meals supplied, and decent health care for his child that includes stress management.", "NAH. \n\nYou and your father need to learn to communicate better. Both of you are doing a poor job of that. \n\nBut\u2026\n\nBeing a single father to a daughter is *very very hard*. I can only imagine it\u2019s more so when that child has a medical condition. Your dad gets to vent to his friends and family, even if you don\u2019t like what he\u2019s saying. \n\nGive your old man a break, learn to communicate better with him, and maybe come up with a more formal delineation of chores so you both know the expectations.", "How is doing the chores causing disabilities? What stress do you have at 16 exactly? Can't believe someone commented that this is abuse. This generation is effed if doing household chores leads to so much stress at age 16 that you now have neurological issues. Who pays for the roof over your head? And the food you eat and the clothes you wear? \n\nNeurological issues from stress. Pls.
