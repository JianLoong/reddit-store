I probably shouldn't have read the messages, but he left his phone open and curiosity got the better of me.\nHe went on to express how hard it is as a single father, and how I never do anything to help him.

With all of this, he failed to mention my disabilities or anything good about me at all.\n\nHe had recently began to complain to me about how little I do and got mad at me over small things.

I also expressed that I felt although he didn't appreciate me enough. He denied everything.\n\nThis is where I may be the asshole.

You are doing a remarkable job and he should appreciate you.\n\nHe is so totally wrong for talking about you and criticizing you ever. I'm glad you called him out on it and are waiting for him to apologize.

Cuz 2 chores after school don't lead to a burn out and wouldn't classify as \"everything\" \n\nRegardless.
