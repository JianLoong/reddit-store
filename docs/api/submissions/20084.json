You say the money is good at the job, which means your aunt is proof you don't need a college degree.\n\nIt's important to realize that hard labor is still an essential part of how the world works.

She was self-conscious of her lack of education. Good on you for working toward a STEM education. However, I wouldn't remind your aunt that she didn't do what you are doing.

Education is a great tool, but so is hard labor.\n\nShe's the AH for telling you that and feeling insecure about herself.  \n\nDon't forget to thank your mom for helping you out.", "Education and institutionalized schooling aren't mutually exclusive. In retrospect, I learned just as many valuable skill sets, if not more from, \"on the job\"  training (which I had to gain while working to pay off my schooling), than I did from graduating college.\n\nIntelligence and knowledge come in many different forms. Just because someone may not have formal schooling, doesn't mean they haven't gleaned extensive information assimilation through life and in-field experiences, and/or autodidacticism. Some brilliant minds, wise sages and outside-the-box/neurodivergent thinkers might even clash with standardized schooling and it's important to remember that. So, try not to judge others just based on their level of education. Too many people already do that and it's detrimental to everyone involved as companies then lose out on some great employees and people are given less opportunities to prove themselves on account of it.\n\nConversely, I also know many professors and doctors who have achieved scholastically early in life but haven't thrived in their chosen professions beyond that  since they never had to learn to keep a sustained effort going and didn't develop personal endurance. School just happened to come naturally to them, whereas, everyday life doesn't always come so easily by comparison.\n\nStreet smarts, people skills, fortitude and integrity are not easily taught or gained and schooling cannot protect against all forms of ignorance. As humans, we are constantly learning but will likely never know the answers to some of the most pressing questions and mysteries life offers -no matter how long or hard  we study.\n\nNo one knows what the future holds and no matter how well-prepared we think we are, anything can happen when we least expect that could render us completely powerless. This is why compassion for others and ourselves is so vital.\n\nCollege and secondary institutionalized learning are in many instances privileges which not everyone can afford or manage to obtain for a myriad of different complications and reasons that may not be readily apparent to an outside observer. It's far from a perfect system and in some cases, such as predatory student loans, college ends up costing some people more than it benefits them -especially if one is interested in pursuing certain fields that require more abstract thinking and creative pursuits. While much of it depends on many different factors, it's not a one-size-fits-all situation, generally speaking and yet students are often expected to conform into its limited confines.  If it's going to be compulsory, it should be free but at least in the USA, this isn't the case and even in other countries, many students are underserved merely for being less academically inclined or for having special needs that aren't being met  properly.\n\nIt's not fair your aunt was being unduly harsh to you and that's not right but keep in mind she's had to live in a society that belittles people in her profession for many absurd reasons, many of which may even be outside her own control and she most likely feels insecure and burned out from years of all that intensive physical work, which as you have experienced, takes a serious toll. She might even be in chronic pain too.\n\nSometimes, it's ultimately easier to take the higher road in the long run and in the future try to just ignore her rather than saying anything rude back since most insults reflect more on the person doling them out than they do on those on the receiving end of them. Lashing back onto others typically just gives them more excuse, ammunition and leverage to continue to be unpleasant. You have her in your current professional as well as personal life so stooping to her level just makes your situation harder on both fronts. \n\nWhile it may not currently feel like it, you are fortunate to have the opportunity to go to college and also get experience from your job. Dealing with seemingly difficult personalities and certain kinds of challenges can ultimately be helpful if properly utilized since they provide plenty of emotional growth opportunities.

Question: did she help you get that job?", "Your pending degree doesn't mean shit. You're working the same job. You're not better than her or anyone else for that matter. \n\nESH", "ESH. Ive gone back and forth between college and hard labor. Hard labor does suck and is harder. but you said that your aunt graduated hs, and you graduated hs but haven\u2019t gone to college,so in what way are you not just as uneducated as her", "College is great if it's for you trade school is great if it's for you getting a job and going to work is great if it's for you. Looking down on those who have chosen a different path to their life makes YTA. \n   As you stated your working in their world trying to achieve your dreams so you should know how hard they work and belittling them makes you the weekly king AH", "NTA if you speak what you want you will hear what you don't want to someday", "Honestly, I would say don't say hurtful things to people you love. You could have clapped back by saying that you are in school specifically do you don't have to get used to a job like that. So, you are an asshole.  \n\n\nThat said, she sounds one of those family members who just feels the right to blurt out their opinion to everyone. Then for her to call your mommy the next day to tattle on you. Ha. Someone sure can dish it out, but she can't take it!  So, she is an asshole.  \n\n\nFinally, your mom is an asshole for making excuses for your aunt. \"She's just like that\" is bullshit. Everybody else shouldn't have to tiptoe around someone who is being rude.", "I see it\u2019s unpopular but I\u2019m going to say NTA. People saying you could\u2019ve worded it better or been more delicate seem to missing the part where you (1) were in extreme pain and (2) were on a muscle relaxer for said pain. \n\nAlso, I think it\u2019s bullshit that people who skipped out on school (for whatever reason) want to get into a pissing match about education. It\u2019s all fun and games when they\u2019re the ones picking at/ making fun of/ outright insulting people who pursue higher education but if the you snap back then it\u2019s an issue? You\u2019ve made it more than obvious in your comments you don\u2019t look down on people without higher education and clearly only mentioned it because of the \u201coptions\u201d thing.", "NTA.  She put herself in that position.  She has no say over where you \"spend the rest of your life.", ">am now in university for biochemistry\n\nI know it sounds fancy and at uni they'll tell you how great you are and how great the jobs are.

That kind of hard physical labor does catch up to people - bodies break down all the faster, serious injuries are more likely, and those affect quality of life. Among my coworkers, anyone who has been doing it for about 10 years has suffered from a severe injury that has required rehab and a permanent change in the kind of duties they can perform.\n\nSome people can do it and thrive.

Oh no taste of her own medicine! Should OP just take it forever?!", "She could have directed the insult to the aunt, instead of people who do hard labor jobs. There's plenty of educated people who do hard labor because the job market sucks ass and they have no choice.", "I hate when people say this. How did she not have the same opportunities? She and OP's mother grew up in the same exact family. OP's aunt CHOSE to reject education, which is ignorant af. Like school's not for everyone, but to be anti-education is so bizarre to me and only in America is education synonymous with being elitist. There are these weird discourses about \"real work\" and a strong distrust of education of all kinds from the right. Changing curriculums, erasing history, banning books. And then these same people make it impossible to create educational opportunities for the next generation, their kids instead of stuck in money pits because of how fucking expensive it is to get one. They hold up the way student debt fucks people over as proof that education is useless. Not everyone is meant to be a physical laborer and not everyone is meant to go to college either but pretending like that's not the case, as the aunt does, makes you an asshole.", "Right, also there\u2019s a bunch of reasons someone might not be able to access higher education, despite valuing it. U can also have a degree etc and still end up in a manual job. I don\u2019t agree with the aunt, but this post just gives me superiority complex vibes from op", "That last statement is purely anecdotal.

If her aunt wants to dish it, she better be ready to take it.", "I don\u2019t think she thinks she\u2019s stephen hawking, all she wants is for her aunt to leave her alone is what it sounds like. There is nothing wrong with not wanting to do tedious, manual labor. Her aunt needs to mind her business and then maybe OP wouldn\u2019t have to insult her to get her off her back, she\u2019s a grown ass 50 year old woman, she should find something better to do than bicker about her niece experiencing a little soreness from work. I think the OP was wrong for making that comment, but that doesn\u2019t come out of nowhere, that comes from someone constantly belittling and sticking their nose where it doesn\u2019t belong.", "So you would go out to a restaurant in your filthy work clothes then have a chip on your shoulder about people looking down on you? That sounds like you're the one that fucked up.", "Hell half the people I work with in food service have degrees, myself included.

No I don\u2019t look down on people who do physical labour but it\u2019s not a life that I want. It\u2019s not even a life I could handle given my health problems. I left some stuff out of my post because I was in a rush but my aunt has always been so bossy and mean to people she sees as beneath her. I\u2019ve always had to put up with her comments to just save face but that day I just didn\u2019t have it in me.", "Yes it is, that's why I said based on my experience  and not yours.", "We don\u2019t know that. Sounds like at minimum the Aunt is a more senior employee. So it very well may be \u201cher business\u201d while they are at work. Its clear OP feels she\u2019s too good for manual labor and \u201cisn\u2019t cut out for it.\u201d Judging by her overall attitude I\u2019m sure that comes across to her coworkers as well. Her looking down on her \u201cuneducated\u201d aunt even though she really isn\u2019t all that more educated than her is ridiculous. I also highly doubt taking muscle relaxers while working at a processing plant with alot of machinery/moving parts is remotely safe. Sounds like the uneducated aunt picked up on all of it and called her out on her BS. OP likely has some growing up to do and her HS diploma, which is all she has, isn\u2019t remotely impressive enough to be so high up on her horse.", "That's not what was said. \nI read it as \"my options aren't as limited as yours\", which is different and yes, would put someone in their place.", "Yeah, but saying \"this horrible crap job is what you're cursed with for the rest of your life\" is easily full provocations/justification for coming back with that. Definitely the kind of \"justified AH\" that defaults to NTA in lieu of a more specific option.", "Smarter and better educated are 2 completely different things. Some of the smartest people I know didn\u2019t go past high school and some of the biggest morons I know have multiple degrees.   Unfortunately, OP, your comments put you in the latter category.", "I get what you were trying to say, but you could have definitely worded it better. Instead of putting her education (or lack thereof) down raise your own. You could have said \"I studied at college so I have more options than just that.\" And then tell her some of the jobs that require a college education. The best insults are the ones where you don't need to offend the other part.", "Understandable. A dainty thing like you wasn't built for hard labor.", "Doesn\u2019t really prove a point if it\u2019s anecdotal so what\u2019s the point of adding it?", "You know what, the medication bit is the only good point i\u2019ve seen for that side of the argument and i can concede at that. However, the text doesn\u2019t explicitly say that her aunt said anything about OPs muscle relaxer use, it reads more like her aunt was aggravated simply by the OP experiencing pain in her arm, but to be fair, the OP ofc has her own bias.", ">I read it as \"my options aren't as limited as yours\",\n\nYes, but she also said \"because im not as stupid as you\" wich was a bit unnecessary.", "Well currently their options *are*  as limited as hers or they would be doing something they hated less to make money for tuition. So they aren't even right", "Fair enough. The way I read it is closer to \u201cmy options are better cause you\u2019re dumber\u201d", "It justified a better response than she gave.", "Aunt's comments put her in both categories of \"stupid\" and \"uneducated\" though, as well as gloating over someone's pain making her the AH before OP uttered a word. She earned it.", "She didn't call the aunt stupid. She said she was uneducated, which is a fact independent of her intelligence.", "She more than earned it. Well more.", "Im not saying she didnt deserve it, but OP seems to think shes a better person than her aunt just because she has a higher education, OP mentioning the aunts son eventhough he has literally nothing to do with this proves that"]}
