I graduated high school with honours and am now in university for biochemistry. Currently I am living with my mom and working to save money for tuition.

The other night during our break I had a lot of back pain so I took a muscle relaxer. It was hard to move my left arm and my aunt didn\u2019t like that. She is normally very cranky and bossy so I wasn\u2019t surprised when she went on a rant about how I will have to suck it up because this will be my life from now on.

Normally I\u2019d just ignore her but I was so on edge that I snapped and said something along the lines of \u201cI will never have to get used to hard labour because I\u2019m not as uneducated as you so I have better options.\u201d This job doesn\u2019t require any sort of schooling and you don\u2019t even have to pass in a resume to apply.

Not sure what her son has to do with this, but like you admit, the job pays well, so it's working out for your aunt who has a high school education. And apparently you can do it even if you are partway through university. Your aunt is wrong that doing one job means you'll do it forever, but you're wrong that having (part of) a university education means you'll never have to work at a job that you consider to be beneath you. And you're really both too old to fight like this at work.", "ESH. Your aunt was rude as hell and to prove how much better you are than her, you stooped down to her level. Your fancy education won\u2019t mean shit if that\u2019s how you look at people.", "ESH. Aunts an ah but you\u2019re attitude and the way you expressed yourself isn\u2019t any better. Also higher education (depending on the country) is generally a scam unless you choose certain majors  so higher education doesn\u2019t really dictate anything.", "ESH.", "ESH\n\nyou based your argument on a wish, your right in the same boat as her, till you get your cushy office job, your just a labour worker as well.", "\u2026.you look down on people who work physical labor work\u2026.?", "ESH. I know you were at the end of your rope and you lashed out but you accomplished nothing. You haven't changed her world view. Your best revenge will be going off and living the life you're working towards. She'll still complain behind your back but in the end she's not your problem. She doesn't sound like a very good person.\n\nI do have some problems with you dissing manual labor. You may not be made for it but it puts food on your table, furniture in your home, and a multitude of other things you use every day and take for granted. When you're working in a lab just remember that all of the equipment you use doesn't load and unload itself off of trucks.\n\nLearn to ignore her.", "LMAO you think a college education will prevent you from hard labor? That's funny. Tell that to the people who go to trade schools", "ESH\n\nShe's clearly insecure. That is why she tries to tear you down. Obviously that is lousy. But why sink to her level? This could have been the perfect example of living well being the best revenge. You would not have had the instant gratification but imagine it is your last day at your current job. You tell her how much you appreciated the job, but you're not going to miss the hard labor. Then give her a little smile and leave.", "You sound like an AH. You look down on your family and the people you work with. You see them as below you because you're so well educated compared to them. Remember you have the same job as them, even if if is just temporary. If you think this physically demanding job is hard for you, imagine how it is for your 50 year old aunt and others who find it just as hard but they genuinely rely on it. Being humble is free.\n\nAunt was maybe a little too condescending with you considering you are a grown adult now, but remember to act like one if you want to be treated like one.", "[deleted]", "ESH\n\nThere was definitely a more delicate way you could have said that. It's one thing if you tried being polite, but she kept going on and on, and saying something like that was the ONLY way to shut her up, but it sounds like you just snapped.\n\nYour mom is right, while your aunt has no right to be obnoxious, you should learn to hold your tongue in certain situations", "ESH. Your aunt does not understand the value of a good education, and that is unfortunate, but that is what she feels to be true because she has not had the opportunities you have had.\n\nThis does not make it right for you to belittle her. Yes, you should learn when to hold your tongue, and this was one of those times.", "YTA you don\u2019t even have the degree yet, you don\u2019t get to say you\u2019ll never be uneducated", "I don't think you are necessarily an asshole.

Check yourself", "NTA. \"Uneducated\" is hardly a slur and in this case has a basis in fact. How did your mother and aunt become so diametrically opposed in their views on education? Same parents, right?", "NTA.... This \"respect your elders while they disrespect you\" shit sucks. Boomers/Late X love this we went through it so should you crap. I applaud you for sticking up for yourself.\n\nEdit: Considering anything supportive is being down voted to hell, bring it. But honestly, people act like they should be honored to get your body destroyed for a company that is making mounds of money over your back breaking work. OP did not say she is above them. So many people being personally attacked by the comments instead of looking at the situation. Reminder to other commenters, this is not about you.", "NTA", "NTA you stated a fact.\n\nit is up to the individual to decide of being \"unneducated\" is an insult or not, seeing as how it was  choice to go uneducated in this case.\n\nBesides, she was asking for it. You just managed to communicate to her on her level.", "NTA but your aunt sure is. Kind of your mom too. No one should have to \u201chold their tongue\u201d when someone else isn\u2019t holding theirs and is being unpleasant.", "NTA. She shouldn't run her mouth if she can't handle people talking back to her.", "NTA\n\nLook you hit below the belt but so did she by calling your education pointless. \n\nPeople need to learn to take what they dish out. \n\nHad she not said anything and you just lashed out and called her uneducated - of course you are TA by a mile. But that's not what happened.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell your mom to stay out of it,. Your aunt is your coworker, and you are EQUALS. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"my mom said I need to hold my tongue better because my aunt is just like that.\" ... So tell your mom she needs to hold her tongue better because you are just like that.", "NTA your aunt just can't handle facts. You will have a office job she will have basic uneducated labor jobs forever. \n\nJust remember when you have a great job w a good income who had your back and who gave you shit. Once you make it remember to never help her one bit", "NTA\nYeah you probably didn't go about it the best way but  she needs to see that her words have consequences.", "nta. she put herself in that situation, i would've snapped too. you're auntie had no right to say that bs", "NTA. You reacted with insults towards your aunt because her continuous and bothersome behavior, despite being aware of your medical condition and the hard work you put into funding your education, caused you to feel demotivated and ridiculed. It was during a moment of vulnerability that you found it difficult to handle her persistent actions, leading to the use of insults in response. If I were in your shoes, things would have been a lot rougher for your aunt.", "NTA. Fuck Boomers and old Gen Xers who act like Boomers.", "Being educated is not the be all end all. Sure, it helps but there are so many unqualified people doing back-breaking labour simply to survive. It\u2019s great that you find yourself in a fortunate position to be able to attend higher education, but you are wrong for judging anyone that either cannot do the same or chooses not to for whatever reason. \n\nI\u2019m sure with all this intelligence of yours, you will go far career wise, but at what cost? I\u2019m not sure your attitude will endear you to others. I suppose being rich and alone might not be so bad.
