She barely graduated high school and instilled these views in her son as well. My parents had raised me to view education as the best tool you can have in life and I wholeheartedly agree. I graduated high school with honours and am now in university for biochemistry. Currently I am living with my mom and working to save money for tuition. I am working at the local seafood processing plant where my aunt also works. This job is nearly killing me. I work from 6pm to 5am and it is hard physical labour. I\u2019ll be the first to admit I\u2019m not built for hard labour and I also have some health issues that make it even harder. But the money is good so I stick with it. The other night during our break I had a lot of back pain so I took a muscle relaxer. It was hard to move my left arm and my aunt didn\u2019t like that. She is normally very cranky and bossy so I wasn\u2019t surprised when she went on a rant about how I will have to suck it up because this will be my life from now on. Slaving in a factory because office jobs hardly exist. Normally I\u2019d just ignore her but I was so on edge that I snapped and said something along the lines of \u201cI will never have to get used to hard labour because I\u2019m not as uneducated as you so I have better options.\u201d This job doesn\u2019t require any sort of schooling and you don\u2019t even have to pass in a resume to apply. My comment shut her up for the night but the next day my she called my mom about it and my mom said I need to hold my tongue better because my aunt is just like that. But I don\u2019t think my aunt should just get a free pass at being a b i t you know what. \n\nEDIT/UPDATE:\nThere seems to be mixed opinions on this one and fair enough. I was in a rush when I made this post and had left out some info that may or may not be useful. \n1. My aunt has always been and always will be bossy and mean. It\u2019s not just towards me but everyone. She will say some really nasty shit to anyone unprovoked for god knows why. \n2. I don\u2019t equate uneducated with stupid. I also don\u2019t think trade work is beneath a degree. Both are an education, both require skills. \n3. I have specifically tailored my studies to accommodate my health problems the best I can. I have disability aid on campus and make sure I have documents on file at any job. This current job has been fairly ok with me needed an extra break once in a while but the work is still painful to complete. I have nerve damage, dystonia, and a slipped disk in my back that was \u201cfixed\u201d but still causes pain out of nowhere. \n4 (update). I had gone to my manager to talk about what happened, largely because I assumed he would have known after 4 days but he hadn\u2019t to my surprise. I told him exactly what happened and that I specifically picked a position away from my aunt the first day because we don\u2019t really get along. That was something they had wondered but I didn\u2019t explain why at the time to avoid concern about hiring me. He said he technically has to file a report on the incident and talk to my aunt but considering I was so forthcoming about it I am likely not at risk of losing my job. Am I going to apologize to my aunt? Fuck no. Not unless manager asks me to. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me since the incident and avoids sitting with me at lunch. I haven\u2019t been met with passive aggression in 4 days and it has been wonderful. Anyway, that\u2019s it. I acted poorly and I take responsibility for that, at least on Reddit.

Education is a great tool, but so is hard labor.\n\nShe's the AH for telling you that and feeling insecure about herself.  \n\nDon't forget to thank your mom for helping you out.", "Education and institutionalized schooling aren't mutually exclusive. In retrospect, I learned just as many valuable skill sets, if not more from, \"on the job\"  training (which I had to gain while working to pay off my schooling), than I did from graduating college.\n\nIntelligence and knowledge come in many different forms. Just because someone may not have formal schooling, doesn't mean they haven't gleaned extensive information assimilation through life and in-field experiences, and/or autodidacticism. Some brilliant minds, wise sages and outside-the-box/neurodivergent thinkers might even clash with standardized schooling and it's important to remember that. So, try not to judge others just based on their level of education. Too many people already do that and it's detrimental to everyone involved as companies then lose out on some great employees and people are given less opportunities to prove themselves on account of it. It's often a veiled form of classism as well.\n\nConversely, I also know many professors and doctors who have achieved scholastically early in life but haven't thrived in their chosen professions beyond that  since they never had to learn to keep a sustained effort going and didn't develop personal endurance. School just happened to come naturally to them, whereas, everyday life doesn't always come so easily by comparison.\n\nStreet smarts, people skills, fortitude and integrity are not easily taught or gained and schooling cannot protect against all forms of ignorance. As humans, we are constantly learning but will likely never know the answers to some of the most pressing questions and mysteries life offers -no matter how long or hard  we study.\n\nNo one knows what the future holds and no matter how well-prepared we think we are, anything can happen when we least expect that could render us completely powerless or unable to provide for ourselves in any form of employment. This is why compassion for others and ourselves is so vital.\n\nCollege and secondary institutionalized learning are in many instances privileges which not everyone can afford or manage to obtain for a myriad of different complications and reasons that may not be readily apparent to an outside observer. It's far from a perfect system and in some cases, such as predatory student loans, college ends up costing some people more than it benefits them -especially if one is interested in pursuing certain fields that require more abstract thinking and creative pursuits. While much of it depends on many different factors, it's not a one-size-fits-all situation, generally speaking and yet students are often expected to conform into its limited confines.  If it's going to be compulsory, it should be free but at least in the USA, this isn't the case and even in other countries, many students are underserved merely for being less academically inclined or for having special needs that aren't being met  properly.\n\nIt's not fair your aunt was being unduly harsh to you and that's not right but keep in mind she's had to live in a society that belittles people in her profession for many absurd reasons, many of which may even be outside her own control and she most likely feels insecure and burned out from years of all that intensive physical work, which as you have experienced, takes a serious toll. She might even be in chronic pain too.\n\nSometimes, it's ultimately easier to take the higher road in the long run and in the future try to just ignore her rather than saying anything rude back since most insults reflect more on the person doling them out than they do on those on the receiving end of them. Lashing back onto others typically just gives them more excuse, ammunition and leverage to continue to be unpleasant. You have to deal with her in your current professional as well as personal life so stooping to her level just makes your situation harder on both fronts.\n\nWhile it may not currently seem like it, you are fortunate to have the opportunity to go to college and also get experience from your job. Dealing with seemingly difficult personalities and certain kinds of challenges can ultimately be helpful if properly utilized since they provide plenty of emotional growth opportunities.

You just said she hasn\u2019t cared about it much. But I promise, everyone wants to be smart and educated even if they say they don\u2019t care. Saying \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d is a defense mechanism a lot of the time. Maybe she wanted an education but something happened and she couldn\u2019t finish high school or go to college. Never EVER equate someone\u2019s \u201cschooling\u201d with how intelligent they are. I have a brother who has a genius IQ. He\u2019s absolutely the smartest person I\u2019ve ever known and I look up to him A LOT. He dropped out of highschool 2 months before graduating and dropped out of college after 1 semester. Yet he\u2019s still the smartest person I\u2019ve ever known. He said that he didn\u2019t feel challenged enough and that it all felt boring. He works at a Toyota manufacturing place and makes $60 an hour. He\u2019s making more money than anyone in my family ever has. He\u2019s held that job for over a decade and has a very very nice home and a brand new car. His credit score is near 800. So telling your aunt she isn\u2019t as educated as you and therefore doesn\u2019t have \u201call the options\u201d you have is not only rude but in some cases can be totally inaccurate. You probably seriously hurt her feelings. Have you ever told her your plans about your future education/what job you plan to have in the future? She probably genuinely thought you would be working at this factory for a good few years atleast. And if you know that\u2019s how your aunt is, why provoke the bear? You already know not to take it personally if she\u2019s like that towards everyone. So in this case, I must say, YTA.\n\n\nEdit: Also, I\u2019m STILL thinking about this just because of how blatantly rude you were to your aunt. You said it yourself it\u2019s pretty good money.

I\u2019m sure she\u2019s thought back on her life and wished she had done a lot of things differently. But she shows up for work everyday and that\u2019s more than a lot of people do. So what you\u2019re going to college for biochemistry? That doesn\u2019t make you a genius. Doesn\u2019t make you any better. Your aunt is in her 50s and she has a lot of years on you. You need to respect your elders. She\u2019s walked this earth for a lot of years, has gained knowledge and wisdom on life (even if it isn\u2019t an actual school education) and has probably been through more than you can fathom. I wouldn\u2019t speak to you either if you acted like that. Straight up rude, girl. Not to mention, she\u2019s probably the one that helped you even get this job, right? You sound ungrateful and a bit entitled. Just blows my mind how young people can talk to someone older than them like that. Asshole or not, she\u2019s put time in on this planet. She\u2019s been working a job she probably hates all while raising her kid. Then she has to listen to a 20 something year old tell her she isn\u2019t educated enough FOR ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE?

My first inclination if I was in your situation would be to maybe think about your aunt's life.  I mean as a whole.  Was she afforded the same opportunities as you have been given in life?  Did she have to quit school early in life in order to work to help provide for her family to keep things afloat?  Sometimes it isn't the best idea to opt for aggression with someone, especially if you don't understand their whole story like that.  I get that she's a family member with an annoying tone and says the same annoying bullshit all the time but you have to realize that maybe she is saying these things through a filter of insecurity.  Maybe she feels like it isn't fair that she didn't get a chance to pursue a degree in biochemistry like you, and she might be envisioning all of the possible versions of her life that could have existed but instead what does she have?  In her 50s working a manually intensive job as a woman, not looking good.  I fully understand your annoyance because both my parents, for my entire life, did basically that same thing.  They attacked and belittled me in almost every way possible because, as I can see now, they were insecure when they saw that I had opportunities that they didn't, and as a child I didn't understand what was going on, I thought they hated me but now as an adult I can see that really, they were just jealous.  It's taking a lot of effort to try and get over that plus the physical abuse.\n\nAlso, I hate to sound like my parents but I strongly feel like I need to say don't you ever dare look down on working manual labor.  What are you going to do when you have to be out in that 100 plus degree heat all day everyday for 12, 16, 18, however many fucking hours just to build a house or put in some drywall or fix someone's roof just to barely make enough to make ends meet and you just have to keep doing it every single day, no breaks because you don't have enough money to quit and you have a family to provide for.  This separates men from boys.  Will you endure the punishment because you have an obligation as a role model and parent to fulfill that part of your contract, or will you give up?  Please learn to give grace to those who may not have been as fortunate as you.  Because I can tell you firsthand from fighting for my life almost passing out from heat exhaustion more times than I can count because I couldn't find no shade or get no water and constantly enduring the suffering that comes from manual labor work that everyone can talk a big game, but when it comes down to it, you gotta have some real fucking strength to come out the other side on top in some of those situations.  \n\nI can't stress to you how much I understand that it's annoying as fuck when someone tries to belittle you like that, I get it.  But sometimes you just need to take a few seconds of breathing, introspection, patience, and you'll realize what's really important.  You have confidence in yourself and your abilities to have a successful career in your field.  Bank on that.  Let your aunt say whatever she pleases, water off your back, no big deal.  Staying positive can save your life. As long as you can envision yourself living a certain life, invest in that and believe in it.", "ESH. Your aunt is rude as hell and did deserve to be checked.

I know people who have a 4th grade education. Now these folks which they could read, write and understand things others do, but the number one reason they left school was to go to work. Quite possibly that's Aunt's story.

Sometimes the happening is going back to something you thought was in you past. So. OP should not be so sure more manual labor is not in their future. \nOP was not wrong about having better options. They will have options which Aunt does not have nor maybe wants to have. To have more options is OP's goal. They recognize their health concerns and limitations then chose an appropriate career path. \nIt sounds like Aunt is an unhappy person and family has allowed her to treat everyone poorly for years. \n\nOP and Aunt are both in the wrong in this situation. OP struck a low blow because he responded to Aunt with the same energy. OP should have addressed the issue of working with Aunt prior to letting it get to them and losing their temper. Aunt struck a low blow because she is aware of OP's physical limitations. Aunt essentially told OP their education was pointless and they should just get used to a life of physical pain.

It's usually when we are worn down, feel vulnerable, and have reached our limit for tolerating the mistreatment.  \n\nYour mother's response of \"she's just like that\" feels very similar to family members who have grown up with someone like your aunt. You see it a lot when the child behaving inappropriately is challenging to manage, so parents instead choose to manage their other children to prevent setting off the other child. Everyone ends up stepping through a minefield just to ensure peace is maintained. The chaos and damage of tailoring your whole lives (and your children's early lives) to placate one person who has unhealthy, unreachable levels of needs (not the fault of the child, they need professional help), gets explained away with \"That's just how (child) is!\" and \"That's just what families do/That's what you do when you love someone\". It helps to alleviate the guilt, and the feeling deep down that it's not okay.  \n\nYou don't have to play peacekeeper, too. You have seen, AND experienced your aunt's toxic behaviour. You defended yourself.
