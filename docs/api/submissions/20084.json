She barely graduated high school and instilled these views in her son as well. My parents had raised me to view education as the best tool you can have in life and I wholeheartedly agree. I graduated high school with honours and am now in university for biochemistry. Currently I am living with my mom and working to save money for tuition. I am working at the local seafood processing plant where my aunt also works. This job is nearly killing me. I work from 6pm to 5am and it is hard physical labour. I\u2019ll be the first to admit I\u2019m not built for hard labour and I also have some health issues that make it even harder. But the money is good so I stick with it. The other night during our break I had a lot of back pain so I took a muscle relaxer. It was hard to move my left arm and my aunt didn\u2019t like that. She is normally very cranky and bossy so I wasn\u2019t surprised when she went on a rant about how I will have to suck it up because this will be my life from now on. Slaving in a factory because office jobs hardly exist. Normally I\u2019d just ignore her but I was so on edge that I snapped and said something along the lines of \u201cI will never have to get used to hard labour because I\u2019m not as uneducated as you so I have better options.\u201d This job doesn\u2019t require any sort of schooling and you don\u2019t even have to pass in a resume to apply. My comment shut her up for the night but the next day my she called my mom about it and my mom said I need to hold my tongue better because my aunt is just like that. But I don\u2019t think my aunt should just get a free pass at being a b i t you know what. \n\nEDIT/UPDATE:\nThere seems to be mixed opinions on this one and fair enough. I was in a rush when I made this post and had left out some info that may or may not be useful. \n1. My aunt has always been and always will be bossy and mean. It\u2019s not just towards me but everyone. She will say some really nasty shit to anyone unprovoked for god knows why. \n2. I don\u2019t equate uneducated with stupid. I also don\u2019t think trade work is beneath a degree. Both are an education, both require skills. \n3. I have specifically tailored my studies to accommodate my health problems the best I can. I have disability aid on campus and make sure I have documents on file at any job. This current job has been fairly ok with me needed an extra break once in a while but the work is still painful to complete. I have nerve damage, dystonia, and a slipped disk in my back that was \u201cfixed\u201d but still causes pain out of nowhere. \n4 (update). I had gone to my manager to talk about what happened, largely because I assumed he would have known after 4 days but he hadn\u2019t to my surprise. I told him exactly what happened and that I specifically picked a position away from my aunt the first day because we don\u2019t really get along. That was something they had wondered but I didn\u2019t explain why at the time to avoid concern about hiring me. He said he technically has to file a report on the incident and talk to my aunt but considering I was so forthcoming about it I am likely not at risk of losing my job. Am I going to apologize to my aunt? Fuck no. Not unless manager asks me to. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me since the incident and avoids sitting with me at lunch. I haven\u2019t been met with passive aggression in 4 days and it has been wonderful. Anyway, that\u2019s it. I acted poorly and I take responsibility for that, at least on Reddit.

Education is a great tool, but so is hard labor.\n\nShe's the AH for telling you that and feeling insecure about herself.  \n\nDon't forget to thank your mom for helping you out.", "Education and institutionalized schooling aren't mutually exclusive. In retrospect, I learned just as many valuable skill sets, if not more from, \"on the job\"  training (which I had to gain while working to pay off my schooling), than I did from graduating college.\n\nIntelligence and knowledge come in many different forms. Just because someone may not have formal schooling, doesn't mean they haven't gleaned extensive information assimilation through life and in-field experiences, and/or autodidacticism. Some brilliant minds, wise sages and outside-the-box/neurodivergent thinkers might even clash with standardized schooling and it's important to remember that. So, try not to judge others just based on their level of education. Too many people already do that and it's detrimental to everyone involved as companies then lose out on some great employees and people are given less opportunities to prove themselves on account of it. It's often a veiled form of classism as well.\n\nConversely, I also know many professors and doctors who have achieved scholastically early in life but haven't thrived in their chosen professions beyond that  since they never had to learn to keep a sustained effort going and didn't develop personal endurance. School just happened to come naturally to them, whereas, everyday life doesn't always come so easily by comparison.\n\nStreet smarts, people skills, fortitude and integrity are not easily taught or gained and schooling cannot protect against all forms of ignorance. As humans, we are constantly learning but will likely never know the answers to some of the most pressing questions and mysteries life offers -no matter how long or hard  we study.\n\nNo one knows what the future holds and no matter how well-prepared we think we are, anything can happen when we least expect that could render us completely powerless or unable to provide for ourselves in any form of employment. This is why compassion for others and ourselves is so vital.\n\nCollege and secondary institutionalized learning are in many instances privileges which not everyone can afford or manage to obtain for a myriad of different complications and reasons that may not be readily apparent to an outside observer. It's far from a perfect system and in some cases, such as predatory student loans, college ends up costing some people more than it benefits them -especially if one is interested in pursuing certain fields that require more abstract thinking and creative pursuits. While much of it depends on many different factors, it's not a one-size-fits-all situation, generally speaking and yet students are often expected to conform into its limited confines.  If it's going to be compulsory, it should be free but at least in the USA, this isn't the case and even in other countries, many students are underserved merely for being less academically inclined or for having special needs that aren't being met  properly.\n\nIt's not fair your aunt was being unduly harsh to you and that's not right but keep in mind she's had to live in a society that belittles people in her profession for many absurd reasons, many of which may even be outside her own control and she most likely feels insecure and burned out from years of all that intensive physical work, which as you have experienced, takes a serious toll. She might even be in chronic pain too.\n\nSometimes, it's ultimately easier to take the higher road in the long run and in the future try to just ignore her rather than saying anything rude back since most insults reflect more on the person doling them out than they do on those on the receiving end of them. Lashing back onto others typically just gives them more excuse, ammunition and leverage to continue to be unpleasant. You have to deal with her in your current professional as well as personal life so stooping to her level just makes your situation harder on both fronts.\n\nWhile it may not currently seem like it, you are fortunate to have the opportunity to go to college and also get experience from your job. Dealing with seemingly difficult personalities and certain kinds of challenges can ultimately be helpful if properly utilized since they provide plenty of emotional growth opportunities.

To beat narcs is to go in not caring how you are perceived by them and not to sink to their level of external validation.  \nAs for how to play publicly, that's different. This is just making them hurt to make them leave you alone, not playing politics to destroy them because OP is just a normal person, better than us and we're judging whether they were the AH not whether they came off as it to a crowd. If I was telling her how to destroy her aunt's life the answer is just appeal to the crowd whenever the bullying starts, beg her loudly and publicly to just leave her alone and stop enjoying her sadness. But the question she wanted answering was whether she did anything assholish, and you bringing \"stooping to her level\" isn't helpful there."]}
