The driver was completely wrong to make assumptions about your physical condition, and even more wrong to suggest you were lying about it.", "NTA. Your disability is invisible, not nonexistent. There were obviously other people who could stand; you could not. The bus driver singling you out was just a dick move.", "NTA.  I would also report that driver to the transit system.", "Of course you're NTA and you know that; but, thanks for reminding everyone who reads this that appearances can be deceiving, and not to judge based on the superficial appearance that a person doesn't \"look disabled\". There are many kinds of invisible disability.", "NTA\nYou should report that driver. Anyone who drives a bus for a living should know that some disabilities are invisible. Driver should be disciplined for this outrageous public shaming. I'm so sorry this happened to you.", "of course you're not wrong for not giving up your seat. They don't understand your condition.

There are a lot of people who have invisible disabilities, and that bus driver needs to learn that they don't get to decide who is, and isn't disabled. I have Ehlers Danlos, and have had to deal with similar issues a lot, and people like that don't learn to do better until someone makes them.", "no, you were not wrong. I think it's great the bus driver is looking after people that need a seat but first of all, she should have asked you if you could get up, not told you, and then accepted your explanation. I'm sure there were others on there who could have gotten up.", "NTA  this drives me insane when people assume you don't have any disabilities or mobility issues just because they can not see them! You could have seriously hurt yourself more by standing up on the bus and the bus driver had no right to order you to move. I'm glad you stood or well sat your ground! I hope you got plenty of rest once you got home.", "NTA.\n\nPeople lie about this stuff all the time and it hurts people just like you. I'm sorry you have to deal with that. I was yelled at all the time, even almost assaulted once, in my early 20s for using my placard. Even when I would grab my cane, people would accuse me of faking it. \n\nIt's why advocacy and education are so important so people are more aware that having a disability isn't exclusive to age or appearance or the kind of assistive technology one is using (as in, many people only picture someone in a wheelchair as having a disability).\n\nBesides, I'm sure there were plenty of able-bodied people in seats staying awfully quiet during all of this.", "Easy NTA.

I was only 5 minutes from my stop.\n\nYou do not have to put your health and well-being at risk because other people think that you don't look disabled enough. Frankly, the bus driver was being an absolute dick for not believing you after you explained, and I honestly think that's a situation where you should report the driver.  \n\n\n>I don't qualify for a mobility aid. I have braces I can wear when things are really bad but I don't require a  \ncane or wheelchair unless I'm somewhere I have to walk a lot, like an   \namusement park.\n\nYou may not *require* a cane or wheelchair, but it honestly sounds like you would qualify for them.

YOU know you need the seat, don't hurt yourself for someone else's ignorance.", "NTA. You do not owe anyone an explanation. Their ignorance is not your problem.", "NTA, I'm sorry people have invalidated you and made you feel like your disability doesn't matter.

But the young person has legitimate pain.", "NTA and absolutely report the bus driver.  I too have mobility issues and have a placard for my car but if I don't have my cane and start having a bad day I don't even bother with the bus because I'm tired of fighting with assholes for a seat even tho I know if I stand I will likely fall.  Wasted money on Lyft at least helps me avoid a rage stroke.", "People need accessible seats for all sorts of reasons, pregnancy, joint issues, even migraines. NTA and report them.

Great the driver is looking out for people but ask nicely", "Agreed, but probably even a standard adjustable aluminum cane would help. Drugstores sell them, and they shouldn't cost more than $20-$25 dollars. I can walk without one, but my balance is poor, and I am somewhat prone to falls. Getting one and using it was one of the best decisions I've ever made, even though I was in my forties at the time and felt self conscious. Massively less pain and fatigue, and it's an instant visual cue that my mobility isn't normal. If you're on a really tight budget, mobility aids turn up in thrift shops with some frequency."]}
