{"id": 16774, "submission_id": "13ciyp3", "title": "AITA for making my SIL aware of a problem with her son?", "selftext": "My SIL has a 5 year old son who comes over to play with my 3 year old daughter. Yesterday when he came to play he kept smacking my daughters bottom. I let it slide a few times but my niece who was there told him off twice. After he kept doing it I told him off once. Later that evening when he had gone home I sent his mom my sil a message, very politely stating that I'm not being malicious or rude but please can you tell your son not to smack my daughters bottom. She replied saying she's spoken to him and it won't happen again. Fair enough. About 30 minutes later I got a message from my husband who is abroad, asking what happened between SIL and her son. Basically his brother (sils husband) told my husband that I could have told my nephew off and didn't have to escalate further by telling his parents. He stated that nephew will no longer be coming around and nor will he and his wife. I genuinely don't think I did anything wrong but I feel overwhelming guilt that I may have caused a little tension and separation which I did not think would be the case. So am I the AH for bringing it up and telling sil. I should also state that had I told him off they would have been very offended but I told them instead and they're still offended, they don't take well to anyone telling their son off hence why I only did it once.", "created_utc": 1683618429, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ciyp3/aita_for_making_my_sil_aware_of_a_problem_with/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's important to set boundaries and protect your child from any physical or emotional harm. It's also concerning that your SIL and her husband seem to have an issue with their son being disciplined or corrected by others. It's not healthy for a child to grow up thinking they can do whatever they want without consequences. It's understandable that you feel guilty about the situation, but you did the right thing by communicating with your SIL about it.

It's too much for him to be responsible for his own actions so he went to go vent at his brother.  \n  \nYou did nothing wrong. That behavior needs to be cut off immediately and the parents should be informed because they should be reinforcing the fact that it's unacceptable behavior.", "NTA, \n\n>He stated that nephew will no longer be coming around and nor will he and his wife\n\nproblem solved IMO.", "NTA. You're suppose to teach your kids to keep their hands to themselves and not hit other children. Your daughter told him to stop and he repetitively crossed her boundary. You told him to stop and enforced the boundary. You notified your SIL to further enforce the boundary. Your SIL should know her child is hitting and ignoring boundaries.", "NTA-He\u2019s five years old. His parents absolutely need to be made aware of his behavior. Your BIL is so in the wrong here I cannot wrap my mind around his thinking.", "NTA. Your BIL is mad that you \"escalated\" a situation, when in fact, he's the one who made a bigger deal about it by involving your husband who's abroad.\n\nThe fact is, you did the right thing by telling the parent so they could, you know, ***parent*** their child.

BIL ITA.", "NTA two adults corrected this kid\u2019s behavior and it was still an issue. At that point it was reasonable to escalate to his parents although I suspect that won\u2019t make any meaningful effort at correcting him. It sounds like you dodged a bullet on this one. I\u2019d they are not willing to correct this sort of behavior you and your 3 year old do not need him in your home.", "NTA. I think this is important information to hand over.", "I would suspect NTA because you can't allow a 5 year old to learn behaviors like smacking girls on the bottom, but that's still a strange way to say this about a 5 year old.  \"Telling someone off\" generally has some connotation to it.", "NTA (bordering on no one being the AH because who knows how that chain of relayed information became misinterpreted).\n\nIt's problematic behaviour, and could cause a whole riot of issues if he did it with a different child later, so 100% your SIL should want to know so she can have a conversation with the kid and avoid that poop tornado! You told him to stop, he stopped, immediate problem solved; you weren't asking them to retroactively punish him, just to reinforce the point and make them aware in case they want to handle any further teaching from it as parents. Perfect, and seems SIL took it that way from her response to you. \n\nNot sure why BIL is so offended over it, as hubby believes him to be. I would assume likely SIL's shorthand retelling wasn't picked up as cleanly, or he wasn't as peeved as hubby thought he was, and you stressing over this fifth-hand evaluation is not needed. Or maybe he was embarrassed or concerned that you were actually mad about it, or defensive in case you were thinking it implied something...distasteful. Whatever is up, it's their/his baggage or communication error, not anything you did wrong. \n\nMight be worth pinging BIL/SIL a message if you can just to clarify it was only to make them aware, and as far as you're concerned the situation is already resolved and nephew is still more than welcome (as are they), just to make sure they don't think you're wanting to \"escalate\" in any way. Or possibly might be better that coming from hubby, depending on how ye communicate normally/how narked BIL is as far as hubby can tell.
