She's constantly making jokes that I've developed a dad's body, telling me to go workout, gives me funny looks that hints at me gaining weights and subtle comments here and there (in a \"joking manner\"). I don't like it but I take it as banter and try not to be sensitive about it. She's not the same either since we've met, she has let herself go a little, she does have a pouch as well, but every times she asked me about her body, I tell her I don't see any changes but even if there are it's normal and she's still gorgeous. (BTW, I'm not fat, I've just always been muscular and very cut, I've lost my abs definition a little). So the last time she made a comment about me growing a belly, I told her she grew some too, and she got offended... I asked her so it's okay for her to joke about my body and I can't do the same joke towards her? She's  saying that I'm mean and that I'm a man so it shouldn't bother me to hear that and how women are more sensitive about it so it's mean that I said that to her, it gave me the vibe as if she was calling me sensitive, which she had done before too... Keep in mind, she had made comments like that to me and remarks for months now, and I did it to her once, and she's pissed at me and I'm getting the cold shoulder, saying how she said it in a joking manner and that I said it in a serious tone... Idk what to do, AITA?\n\nEdit: I was trying to join in on the banter... Had she taken it as a joke as well, we would've just kept on laughing.

And it's doesn't make me 'sensitive' to not like to be insulted by my partner. It makes me human. You don't get to take digs at me just because you're a girl and I'm a guy. I have feelings too.

She shouldn't be teasing you about your body if it bothers you, but you need to tell her it bothers you instead of just doing it back. Because she does have a little bit of a point in that women face stronger societal pressure to have a perfect body, and harsher consequences when they don't.  A lot of women are very emotionally invested in how they look, because our culture teaches us that our main, or entire, value is in our appearance. A man with a tummy pooch is a man with a tummy pooch. A woman with a tummy pooch is a woman who doesn't care about her health, has let herself go, doesn't care about keeping her man happy, is a failure, a fat pig, etc. \n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that any given individual man is automatically going to be fine with being teased about his body. It might not have the same impact on men on average, but that doesn't mean it has no impact at all, and depending on the particular man it might feel really hurtful.\n\nIt's not being \"too sensitive\" to say \"Hey, when you make those type of comments, it kind of bothers me. I know I'm not in the best shape of my life right now, but I'm still healthy enough, and I've just had other priorities. If this is something more than just joking, if it's something that seriously bothers you and affects your attraction to me, then you gotta realize that when people are together for a long time, bodies change. Maybe that's something you need to think about, but in the meantime, please don't tease me about this anymore. It's unkind and I don't like it.\"", "ESH. You've been hurt by the comments she's making, but you did not mention addressing her behavior directly. Instead, you delivered what you knew would be a hurtful comment to teach her a lesson.", "ESH, be an adult and explain to her straight up it why makes you uncomfortable. You didn\u2019t need to be petty about it.", "Technically NTA but hey, listen up you stupid, silly man:\n\nIf you want to continue to be in a happy relationship with this woman, then it is never ok to comment about your woman's body in any way that is anything on the negative side of the spectrum. Even if only slightly. If you do, you will pay, pay, pay.\n\nInstead, adopt some simple strategies:\n\nHave I gained weight? \nAnswer: \"No, babe, you're as beautiful as ever.\"\n(Misdirect from the issue. Much safer and the answer will satisfy her).\n\nDo these jeans make me look fat? \nAnswer: \"No babe, but I think the other jeans are more flattering on you. They make your ass look even more juicy\"\n(This uses positive complements to let her know that the jeans in question do, in fact, make her look fat, but without you actually saying it)\n\nDo you like this hair color? \n\"Yes, babe, it looks great, but I think that the [insert the non-hideous hair color here] would bring out your eyes more than this one does.\"\n\nSee where I'm going with this? Even if you are 100% in the right, anything negative you say about how she looks will eventually be used against you.

Obviously she is the big AH but you both gotta communicate.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like her making those comments then you don\u2019t like it so you should let her know.  Making a \u201cjoke\u201d back is just being passive aggressive.\n\nIf she is calling you sensitive and not willing to listen to you when you are being serious then maybe this isn\u2019t it because she\u2019s clearly disrespecting you.", "ESH.

She shouldn't have made those comments, but you didn't communicate to her that her comments were hurtful to you, you just let the resentment build up over time and laughed it off.

This is not how relationships should work, OP. The way she's treating you is awful. But trying to hurt her back is not healthy and will do nothing to address the actual issue.
