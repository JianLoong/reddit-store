We were very fortunate and got pregnant on the first try. As soon as we found out, positive test at 5 weeks, we shared on our family chat because we were very excited!  The family chat includes my dad, my brother (22M) and his wife (21F). My brother, who is on deployment,  sends me a lengthy message about how I'm selfish and rubbing it in their face that we are pregnant when we know they've struggled with fertility issues and it's something I should have kept to myself. I know his wife has issues with her reproductive organs that would make it VERY hard for her to conceive but neither of then shared that they were actively trying. I also understand how hard deployments can be, I'm a veteran and my husband is active duty, AND our mom died about 16 months ago, so I'm trying to be really understanding of their feelings and experiences. However, I'm really hurt. I don't think it's wrong to share our excitement. I want to share because if we were to have a miscarriage I would want my family to know and to help me through it. It just seems really out of character for my brother to treat me this way.  His wife hasn't said anything or acknowledged what we said.\n\nEDIT TO ADD\n\nI'd be happy to answer/clarify a few things. \n\n1) They did not share they were trying to get pregnant/recieve fertility treatments. She shared about a year prior that she will likely struggle to conceive but didn't want to go into detail. We respected her privacy and didn't pry. She is shy and very quiet. We all expressed support for her and whatever their journey looks like. \n\n2) I was concerned about miscarriages because I have uterine fibroids, very irregular periods, and I was SA by someone for an extended period of time, multiple times, while I was deployed and didn't have access to birth control. I did not become pregnant, which I am VERY GRATEFUL FOR, but my doctor and therapist both agreed that it could signal that I would face fertility issues. My mom isn't around so I can't get her medical history (which could affect me). The doctor told me that I would have to try for 12-18 months before getting a referral to a fertility clinic and that I should gather resources (such as therapy) and support (husband, friends, family if I'm comfortable with that) to help me through those potentially difficult times.  \n\n3) If I knew they were actively trying and struggling, I would have waited to tell by brother and SIL until he came home and had time to reintegrate but also checked out on my SIL frequently to see what I could do to help/alleviate the stress.", "created_utc": 1678598501, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11p67j7/aita_for_announcing_we_are_pregnant_too_early/", "score": 280, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And the envy which naturally comes with something we can never have happens to someone else... and if he knows you just started trying, that's probably going to hit pretty hard.\n\nIt's a lot to process. Snapping the way he did is a pretty typical grief-response, especially if you're close. (Grieving people tend to lash out at those closest to them)\n\nThat doesn't *excuse* the behavior.

You shared an exciting moment in your life with your close family. Your brother's response was not kind in return. I think your brother is just hurt right now. Not only are they having fertility issues, but he is away from his wife. As someone who had fertility issues I can vouch that it makes you think unkind thoughts at times. Inside I was at times a person I did not like from the pain I felt. I'm not excusing his behavior, just trying to explain how it messes with your emotions.\n\nIt's your decision if you want to reach out and just let your brother know you love them both and never meant to hurt anyone.

Her expecting her brother and SIL to potentially \u201csupport her through\u201d a potential miscarriage WHEN THEY ARE STRUGGLING with fertility, to an extent that they have not fully shared with OP, means that it is incredibly presumptuous of OP to expect, in that situation.

Do you know why?? Because the embryo is only 2-3 weeks old. 40 week pregnancies are based in last menstrual cycle\u2026.those first two weeks \u2026.baby likely hasn\u2019t been conceived yet\u2026.that\u2019s why the miscarriage rate between 6-8 weeks is high\u2026.embryo has to get all embedded and situated and become a fetus at 8 weeks. So most people wait for 8 weeks to confirm a pregnancy with everyone but their SO, not just one test a few days after your missed period. \n\nIf all is well then they all get to celebrate a whole few weeks later. But if not, then she set them up to have to \u201cbe there for her\u201d or\u2026.if her home test was wrong, she just kicked up a lot of drama for no reason but to have people squeal over her\u2026..which didn\u2019t go as planned.\n\nSo yeah, I stand by my statement. 5 weeks was absurd and selfish, given the rest of the situation with her bro and sil, to make the announcement in a Text chain.", "Girl chill no need to panick i just asked a question", "Don't pay any mind.

The \"safe period\" doesn't really exist until the baby is physically there because stillbirth happens. It's why i chose to announce when i found out. I'm now 24 weeks pregnant. We should not shame people into not sharing happy news based on a it could happen. At least the baby was celebrated before it was gone and she doesn't need to suffer alone. It's fine if you want to wait, that's your choice, just as it is hers to share early. Miscarriages is not something that should be hidden because the toll it has on the parents can be great and they WILL need that support unless you rather grieve alone. Which again, your choice", "NTA your life doesn't stop because someone else is having a difficult time. If they have a problem with your good news they need to process those feelings for themselves. You're not responsible for that. Congratulations", "*My brother, who is on deployment, sends me a lengthy message about how I'm selfish and rubbing it in their face that we are pregnant when we know they've struggled with fertility issues and it's something I should have kept to myself.* \n\nI have a sneaking suspicion the family would find out about the pregnancy sooner or later, especially once the baby arrives. Your brother is being silly. Congratulations. NTA.", "NTA-you have every right to make your announcement. Obviously your brother has weak sperm. Thankfully you married a real man.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nBut I will say that if you know they have infertility issues, it seems unreasonable to expect them to help you through it", "This is what I would do if left to my own devices. But most people don't have the pregnancy instincts of a cat.  Op is nta.\n\nInfertility sucks but this was not the way to handle it.", "That's exactly what I'll do. I don't think anything productive will come from texting each other. I'd rather talk in person and give everyone time to cool down.", "I say we because we are both responsible for the child. It's a group project. I grew up with a mom who never had a partner to support her during her pregnancies and I want my husband to be a part of it as much as possible.", "No. My husband makes the \"first-try/100% success rate\" jokes to friends in-person. We just shared that we were 5 weeks pregnant.", "If I had known that they were trying and experiencing difficulties, I would not have that expectation from them. They obviously have enough on their plate.", "I suspect that as well. I wish they had shared their journey with us so we could have been supportive. His wife is very quiet, shy, and keeps to herself so I imagine he hasn't shared out of respect for her wished, which is very understandable. It's just not the best way for him to handle it, I think.", "Some people want people to know so they can send them well wishes/prayers for a healthy pregnancy and be there to support them if they miscarry.", "I\u2019d say that. Let him know you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on and didn\u2019t mean to cause any pain, you hadn\u2019t wanted to hold the news off and cause more pain later on. Ask how they\u2019d rather handle it and maybe that\u2019ll open up the communication a little?", "From the title I thought you might be the husband/non-carrying partner. Fuck no! You and your reasons make sense! I feel bad for them, I'm sure it's painful, but NTA.", "As someone who struggled with conceiving, you are NTA. \nIt's hard and can be and it is painful, but you say 'congratulations, I'm happy for you' and then in private of your home cry your eyes out.\n\nWhen you announce it's your choice, it's never too early or too late, it's in your time.\n\nCongratulations, and I wish you successful pregnancy.", "NTA\n\nOn an unrelated note, if you're a veteran and have any service connection disabilities you can get your entire pregnancy paid for by the VA (usually with the OB/hospital you choice). Its a really generous benefit that a lot of female veterans don't know about.", "Hi OP, you\u2019re definitely NTA and your brother absolutely did not act appropriately, but as someone who went through years of fertility struggles (that ultimately didn\u2019t work), I struggle to call him an AH either. \n\nYou didn\u2019t deserve that reaction from him but may I offer another perspective? Infertility is the worst thing I\u2019ve ever gone through - it breaks your heart on an hourly basis and to someone whose been on the inside of that pain, every single pregnancy announcement feels like a fresh stab in the heart. It brings all of the pain, frustrations and sadness to the surface which can be incredibly overwhelming. I suspect your brother\u2019s reaction had less to do with you specifically, and more that the announcement yet again reminded them of what they can\u2019t have. It\u2019s not fair or logical, but emotions aren\u2019t always logical. \n\nIt can be very hard to share the journey with family because having to answer questions about how you\u2019re doing, what updates there are etc can be upsetting. Equally, never asking and you feel like no one cares about you or your pain. You\u2019re in a no win situation in some ways. Having family members struggling with infertility is like walking a tightrope without a safety net. \n\nIf you have an otherwise good relationship with the two of them, I think getting together to talk it out will go a long way.\n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy OP! I wish you and your family love, peace and happiness  \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a"]}
