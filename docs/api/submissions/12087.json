You have every right to share your news with your family.\n\n>It just seems really out of character for my brother to treat me this way\n\nIt sounds like brother might be hurting pretty bad about the fertility issues. And still grieving the loss of your mom. His mom. And here you are *becoming* a mom. \n\nThat's amplified by all the normal stresses of being on deployment, ofc, but also because... he doesn't know how hurt his *wife* is, hearing the news, since it sounds like she's the one with the medical issue... and he can't be there to comfort her right now. And the envy which naturally comes with something we can never have happens to someone else... and if he knows you just started trying, that's probably going to hit pretty hard.\n\nIt's a lot to process. Snapping the way he did is a pretty typical grief-response, especially if you're close. (Grieving people tend to lash out at those closest to them)\n\nThat doesn't *excuse* the behavior. He didn't have a right to attack you like that, so he's definitely being an AH.\n\nAnd you're definitely NTA.\n\nI'm sorry your lovely announcement didn't get the reaction it deserved. You have as much right as anyone else to enjoy this baby and your pregnancy. \n\nIt sounds like you're trying hard to be considerate. That's all you can really do.

I know it's hard for people who struggle to fall pregnant, but that doesn't mean others should forgo their joy. I'm sure your brother will reflect on it in time and realise his comment wasn't very fair.", "NTA.  Your brother is obviously just jealous of you , which is really unfair. It wouldn\u2019t change anything if you had announced the pregnancy later, he\u2019d probably still be pissed. Congratulations, being a mama is amazing!!", "You are NTA. You shared an exciting moment in your life with your close family. Your brother's response was not kind in return. I think your brother is just hurt right now. Not only are they having fertility issues, but he is away from his wife. As someone who had fertility issues I can vouch that it makes you think unkind thoughts at times. Inside I was at times a person I did not like from the pain I felt. I'm not excusing his behavior, just trying to explain how it messes with your emotions.\n\nIt's your decision if you want to reach out and just let your brother know you love them both and never meant to hurt anyone. After that, share your updates with those who are able to be there for you. I wish you the best in your pregnancy and also the best for your brother and sister-in-law. And yes, things did work out for us so I'm hoping the same for your family.", "NTA.

Your brother is the AH in this scenario.  He's raining on your parade with an excuse that you should have known better.  This is bullcrap.  They didn't indicate they were trying.

Infertility is horrible, but it doesn\u2019t mean that other people can\u2019t and won\u2019t conceive if they choose to. I don\u2019t think announcing early is a problem to family. It\u2019s typically to the public at large that you wait 12 weeks. You can certainly tell the people close to you. I hope your bro and SIL come around and realize that your pregnancy isn\u2019t about their pain and can be happy for you.

We didn't share we were trying because we started trying 5 weeks prior.", "Yeah. I feel like showing up to the next family get together with a baby would be SUPER AWKWARD. \nThank you!", "My dad called to tell me congratulations. It was a PM from my brother so he hasn't seen it and I'm not ready to share that with dad yet. It will upset him that we aren't getting along and mom isn't here to mediate/fix it.", "That's \n\n>You telling them at 5 weeks is over the top and reeks of attention seeking\n\nThat's ridiculous- and weirdly vicious. Some people wait until 12 weeks to tell people they wouldn't want to know about a miscarriage, just to reduce the stress if it happens. But a welcome pregnancy isn't \"attention seeking\"- it's just good news.", "No. I personally waited until the beginning of my second trimester because I wanted to mourn privately if I lost the pregnancy. When bad stuff happens I close in on myself and don't want to interact with anyone. Other people want outside support and interaction when they are going through tough times. That doesn't make them drama queens or attention seeking. It just means that everyone mourns differently.", "How is wanting support if needs be in anyway attention seeking?

And you\u2019re definitely NTA but I do wonder if he meant what he said *or* if he lashed out a little because maybe they\u2019ve just had another negative test/bad news.

Her expecting her brother and SIL to potentially \u201csupport her through\u201d a potential miscarriage WHEN THEY ARE STRUGGLING with fertility, to an extent that they have not fully shared with OP, means that it is incredibly presumptuous of OP to expect, in that situation. That is what HER HUSBAND is for, not the people who have been dealing with it alone for who knows how long. Maybe it\u2019s fine to expect it if dad, but watching my stepmom grieve a year later over my dad\u2019s death, it would be so selfish of me to ask her to \u201chelp me through\u201d something when she\u2019s still going through it herself.

If she wants to say we she can say we\u2026..", "I guess. It's a bit of a group project, in my opinion.", "You are so right. Without that clarification, her family will *definitely* assume that she and her husband are both individually pregnant. Thank you for helping.", "are you a real person?", "It\u2019s 5 weeks lol. 5 weeks. Wait til 8. So you know how weeks are calculated? She\u2019s just missed her period for the first time and taken an early pregnancy test\u2026so she has high HCG in her system\u2026.which can also be positive if the pregnancy almost took but failed\u2026.assuming it did take\u2026.it\u2019s not even a fetus yet\u2026still in the  embryo stage \u2026..smaller than an orange seed\u2026.not even likely seeable on an ultrasound \u2026. Do you know why?? Because the embryo is only 2-3 weeks old. 40 week pregnancies are based in last menstrual cycle\u2026.those first two weeks \u2026.baby likely hasn\u2019t been conceived yet\u2026.that\u2019s why the miscarriage rate between 6-8 weeks is high\u2026.embryo has to get all embedded and situated and become a fetus at 8 weeks. So most people wait for 8 weeks to confirm a pregnancy with everyone but their SO, not just one test a few days after your missed period. \n\nIf all is well then they all get to celebrate a whole few weeks later. But if not, then she set them up to have to \u201cbe there for her\u201d or\u2026.if her home test was wrong, she just kicked up a lot of drama for no reason but to have people squeal over her\u2026..which didn\u2019t go as planned.\n\nSo yeah, I stand by my statement. 5 weeks was absurd and selfish, given the rest of the situation with her bro and sil, to make the announcement in a Text chain.", "Girl chill no need to panick i just asked a question", "Don't pay any mind.

I put my jealousy into doing nice things like buying them care packages of clothes that are their parents style preferences and throwing very nice baby showers and sprinkles\u2026 my point is that your brother is not an AH for being jealous- it\u2019s a human emotion- but I don\u2019t care how upset he was.

Same sister also got mad at me because I told my two best friends the day before I told my family. She felt I should only be telling family that early.
