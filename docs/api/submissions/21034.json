He\u2019s an ex drug addict and a lot of my family have reason to suspect he\u2019s still selling drugs. He\u2019s also just rude, uncouth and a nasty person to be around. Basically a lot of my family and friends have worried about Kayla\u2019s wellbeing for a long time, but because she\u2019s always told us she doesn\u2019t want to end things, nothing has happened and the relationship has continued. Lots of other family members don\u2019t see an issue and think I\u2019m rocking the boat by worrying. \n\nThe night before the wedding, one of the bridesmaids (all of them were Kayla\u2019s sisters) phoned to say that there had been a blazing row between Kayla and Alan, over some messages from another woman found on Alan\u2019s phone. Kayla still wanted to continue with the wedding, and to everyone\u2019s surprise was at the church the next morning. Alan showed up hungover and my brother guessed that he was also high on something from the way he was acting. \n\nI\u2019d frankly had enough of seeing this man insult Kayla, so I chose a moment before things got underway and pulled her aside into a private room. I asked her if she really wanted to do this, and tried to explain to her that the red flags she sees in Alan now would only get worse with time. She was quiet for a long while before breaking down and telling me that she didn\u2019t want to marry him. She asked if I\u2019d leave the room and I didn\u2019t see her for ages after. Turns out she slipped away via a side exit and left the church. We all waited for a while before Alan went to look for her and learned that she\u2019d left. Chaos erupts. \n\nNow I\u2019m being called an AH for breaking them up and for ruining an expensive wedding.

NOT THE ASSHOLE, I\u2019d argued savior. Probably saved her a ton of time, energy, and money!", "NTA. You didnt make her leave and you didnt break them up. You gave her pause to think about what sounds like it would have been a catastrophic life choice.\n\nI can see how you might get blamed for it, but I dont think thats remotely fair and you shouldnt beat yourself up about it.\n\nYou sound like a very good friend to me.", "NTA\n\n\"Wasting\" an expensive wedding is less costly than years of heartache for Kayla followed by a divorce.\n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA. All you did -- literally all you did -- was remind her that she had options. Which is at once nothing (you didn't tell her what to do) and everything (if she can't back out before the marriage is legal, it's going to be harder later, and she likely would have been in that relationship for a while). I'm really glad Kayla has you as a friend. Not all women have that support.", "NTA. You were the only one that had Kayla's back.\n\nSorry everyone else at the wedding didn't get the after party they were willing to sacrifice Kayla's happiness for.", "NTA. She's the one who left and you didn't even know it.", "NTA, you didnt tell her what to do, you asked a question, and in my opinion that question saved her from years of being unhappy, misstreated, and harrased. You are a good friend i hope Kayla finds her happiness", "NTA\nGOOD FOR YOU!  You talked to her privately and you took care of your friend.  She made the decision and it sounds like the right one!  Better a bad day than a bad life!  People who were worried about the finances of it all are clueless.  Be there for your friend.  She\u2019s going to need some support for awhile.", "NTA at all\n\nShe may have just dodged a bullet", "Nta, you did the right thing and saved her. Ignore all the side comments. What really matters most is Kayla\u2019s well being.", "NTA\n\nYou're a hero", "NTA\n\nBetter to ruin an expensive wedding than let your friend live with a miserable marriage.", "NTA   WELL DONE.  You saved someone from many years of misery.", "NTA! Good for you for standing up for your friend. You didn\u2019t break up the wedding. She chose not to go through with it.", "NTA. All you did was let her know it was okay to escape a toxic relationship.", "Absolutely NTA. What Kayla needed was for someone to care enough about her to validate her feelings and you stepped in, as you should have. The family needs to get their priorities in order. \n\nYou also, I think, deserve extra credit for taking the hit with assholes complaining about a ruined wedding. Kayla's getting space to pick up her life after a toxic relationship because you're taking the heat off of her.", "NTA.\n\nYes, weddings are expensive and any breakup is a difficult thing, but it's so much better to walk away from the wedding and lose out on some money, than to legally bind yourself to someone who is only going to make you miserable.\n\nBetter to ruin one day than the rest of your life. \n\nMy family has a tradition where whoever is with the bride or groom in the time just before the wedding (mother, father, sibling, best man, bridesmaid, whatever) takes them somewhere quiet and asks seriously something along the lines of, \"are you sure you want to do this? Because we can leave now and I'll handle everything for you.\" No pressure either way, just support for whatever the soon-to-be-spouse wants. \n\nOne cousin of mine did back out. It turned out her fianc\u00e9 had been getting more emotionally abusive as the wedding date neared, and had gone from throwing things around the room, to throwing things at her. Yes, it was a financial blow, and yes some people were annoyed about travelling to a wedding that didn't happen, but it was the right decision for her and we understood. \n\nMy dad asked me before we got out of the wedding car. His brother (best man) asked him literally when waiting in the church for my mum to arrive. \"You don't have to do this. The money doesn't matter, the people will get over it. We can keep driving if you want.\" If anything, knowing that i COULD escape and I'd be supported made me more confident in my descion to get married.", "NTA. Seems like the family is more concerned about the *expensive* wedding than your friends well-being. They would rather have her marry a drug-addict cheater that shows up to the wedding drunk and high than her being happy. Wft is wrong with them?\nI think what happened here was her being an abuse victim with no help from her family, them even obviously kind of supporting the bad relationship, and looking away from the abuse and you were thr only true friend in this scenario. Her family sounds awful and may be the reason she was stuck in this relationship for so long.", "NTA, You didn't force her to leave it was eventually her decision. And she was obviously unsure of this marriage but pressured by the family, looking at how they reacted to her leaving the wedding. If she agreed to this marriage that would've been years of hell for her. Why are they more worried about her leaving a bad marriage instead of the groom cheating and showing up to his wedding after being high on something (speaks volumes about the respect he has for his \"partner\"). Op you did the right thing, you were looking out for your friend and saved her from an ugly marriage.", "What do we think?
