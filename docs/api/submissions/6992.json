What I would encourage you to remember is that in a good work environment, your colleagues can be a really important and valuable part of your life.\n\nI know lots of people that had their lives changed by a coworker, whether it be getting them a better job, finding a life partner, making each day go more smoothly.\n\nAt your new job I hope you can be a bit more open, even if it\u2019s to say \u201cI get overwhelmed with tons of interaction so I need my lunch hour to centre myself.

You didn't say anywhere that you have anxiety or some mental health issue with being around people, you just don't like to be around people. You didn't say things ended poorly with your boss, the company itself, or a certain employee that would be there. It's a one time lunch. If you want to blow it off, more power to you, but just own the fact that you can't even be bothered to appreciate gestures made for your benefit.

Plus, it is never a good idea to 'burn bridges' when leaving a place of employment.", "NTA.\n\nCompany parties are generally BS anyway.

If your boss really wanted to do a leaving thing for you that you would attend they'd do it on paid work time.", "NTA.

It\u2019s common practice at my work for the boss to order lunch for the crew, or for someone to organize a happy hour event when an employee leaves.  This is especially the case for long term employees.  However, the individual employee and their wishes are taken into account.  A coworker of mine who has been with the organization for over 30 years recently resigned.  She decided to pull the Irish goodbye and her departure was only made known after her last day.

That's why I started taking my lunch during off hours. People always wanted to talk when i took lunch with others and I just couldn't. \n\nAt least if I'm talking about work there's no social boundaries to worry about. It's just the work and cut and dry \" this is what it is\". That's uncomfortable but doable.", "OP is good enough at what they do to be leaving voluntarily, so likely to a better job.\n\nSome people don't WANT to get close to co-workers, and that is perfectly fine and more than acceptable, it's \\*laudable\\* that OP knows themselves that well.\n\nWe introverts don't want to be 'helped', we want to be left the hell alone.", "It's not 'nice' at all IF OP DOESN'T WANT IT AND SAID SO, OPENLY.\n\nSheesh, extroverts have to get over their 'savior' complex.", "Again, OP said \\*they would not attend\\*.\n\nWhy did boss believe that would change?", "Why though? Shouldnt the same logic apply to them? It pleases me to not go.

Yeah, the boss bears blame here too but again, it's not a big deal to just go to the lunch. It's a chance to say goodbye to coworkers after 10 years. If OP had anxiety or some sort of condition, that would be totally different. Just not wanting to go though makes OP TAH. That's totally fine. You're not obligated to do things you don't want to but you can also just embrace the fact that you're more willing to forgo a pretty standard going away party for your own purposes as opposed to going as a thank you and getting a chance to say goodbye to longtime coworkers in a less rigid environment.", "[removed]", "So why are you asking if Y T A if you're so convinced you are not? \n\nBut good grief man, you can't attend ONE lunch or be social with people you've worked with for 10+ years?

However, you could have attended one final sendoff lunch for a couple hours.  Going to lunch is a completely normal thing that everyone does, and is in no way comparable to a DND party.  It was your boss's way of showing appreciation for your presence and your work, and you blew it off.\n\nYou've worked there for 10 years, and yet you essentially showed everyone you work with that you couldn't care less about them.  You sound pretty insufferable.", "And this is why introverts avoid you.\n\nWe don't give a flip about your intentions, just that you don't listen to our 'NO'.", "I show gratitude by doing my job well.

OP thinks he's better than everyone else and they are not worth an hour of his time.", "Not questioning the judgement. I'm questioning your logic.

In some ways its also a memoriam for how the past was and cannot be again.\n\nWhen you chose not to attend the whole thing or even pop in for a few moments, you chose to disregard the spirit of the kindness in the gesture, you chose to take no time to pay any tribute to the past, and you demonstrated what you prioritize over their offers of respect.\n\nIt's not this one lunch and their preferences. It's how you chose and what you chose to prioritize in response to the gesture.", "I see what you're saying but again...one lunch in over 10 years. Life is short...you might want to try to get a friend or two. Being THIS anti-social is again, awkward.", "No one needs to worry about this particular scenario. I've turned down supervisory roles due to my desire to not deal with people. \n\nI don't think I'm better than anyone though.  Exactly the opposite.  I feel like I am a very boring person with little to contribute socially. When I'm forced to, it's very awkward for all involved.", "Now this is sound logic.", "But see, I don\u2019t think there was any kindness in the gesture to start with!\n\nOP made it clear to Boss that they didn\u2019t want a lunch in their honor and would not attend one. Rather than respect OP or try to find another way, Boss plowed ahead and then was upset when OP kept their word.\n\nPer OP their coworkers weren\u2019t mad, so it is just the Boss who is upset - and it is 100% the Boss\u2019s doing for ignoring what OP told them. \n\nWhen you force a specifically unwanted gift or gesture on someone it is not kind.
