He could have colitis or diverticulitis which can be cured with antibiotics or in severe cases, surgery. He really, really has to get to a doctor.

He wants to act like a baby, he needs a diaper.", "56 is not old so this is not \u201cold age\u201d.

Does he have any brothers or sisters you could talk to about getting him to sign a medical power of attorney? This would give you or them the ability to make necessary decisions. At some point he will become disoriented or confused and you\u2019ll be legally able to do what\u2019s best for your family.

Ask him questions on why he thinks he is having this issue and what he thinks he can do about it. Ask if there were a way to make it stop, would he pursue it, even if he didn't like the process. Things of that nature. I would not force or try to address the alcohol use immediately. It sounds like you've already been doing that and it is likely to shut him down. It sounds like he is still in the precontemplation stage and anything you say will fall on deaf ears. Your focus should be on getting him to want to see his physician. No shame. No judgement.

My mother has dragged him to many doctors and they all agree, it\u2019s the beer. He refuses to wear a diaper and has simply stopped leaving the house. He even had a toilet installed at the bottom of the basement stairs due to having a few accidents if my mom was in the bathroom when he suddenly needed to go. It\u2019s a very sad life and we all wish he\u2019d just try the diaper so he could regain some freedom in his last years, but he\u2019s just too proud. That said, this is totally his doing, completely unfair to my mom who is stuck cleaning up after him, dealing with him home and drunk all day, and never really gets to go anywhere because he won\u2019t leave.
