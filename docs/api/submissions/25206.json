He could have colitis or diverticulitis which can be cured with antibiotics or in severe cases, surgery. He really, really has to get to a doctor.

He wants to act like a baby, he needs a diaper.", "56 is not old so this is not \u201cold age\u201d.

Does he have any brothers or sisters you could talk to about getting him to sign a medical power of attorney? This would give you or them the ability to make necessary decisions. At some point he will become disoriented or confused and you\u2019ll be legally able to do what\u2019s best for your family.

She's 25 and idk if she'll ever get away. I would have let her stay with me but I never had a place till now!
