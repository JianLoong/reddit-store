He said he thinks he won\u2019t be of any use because he\u2019ll be freaking out with all the screaming and blood and intensity and he would end up being a disadvantage.

Get signed up for childbirth classes ASAP.", "NTA- tell your husband that he can stand or sit by your head and doesn\u2019t need to watch or see any blood or baby crowning. I blame the media, for reinforcing this belief that men are unable to handle watching women give birth.", "Of course you assumed he'd be there.  What an odd thing for him to assume he wouldn't.   I am sure he didn't mind all the screaming when the baby was being put in you,  I'm sure he can handle the screaming when the baby comes out.  You are a team, him not being there is insane.   He has a huge role, emotional support.   If he can't handle it, he's not dad or husband material.", "So your husband just told you he'll be more occupied with himself and his own likes and preferences than with his wife who is trying to push a child out. And from all this, the part I find the most baffling is that you explicitly told him how he'll be of use by just being there to make your nerves calm.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. Does he live in the 1950s? Did he just imagine he\u2019d be at home handing out cigars to his friends and sipping whisky? \n\nI can\u2019t imagine being so selfish that I\u2019d leave my wife to have OUR child alone. Childbirth can be incredibly traumatic for the woman and having the person she wants there can mitigate those fears. \n\nWhat a complete d bag.", "NTA\n\nNice that your husband, who hasn't had to go through anything for this pregnancy other than have sex, gets to opt out of the birth. Sucks to be you, wife, that you can't just choose not to be there. \ud83d\ude44 \n\nMy husband was super useless during the births of both of our kids, but he was still there. One emergency surgery, one natural. Either way, he hates hospitals, hates blood, hates my pain, but was there for all 27 and 49 hours of labor for each kid. Come on, OP's husband. Do better for your family. \n\nI also wholeheartedly recommend a doula. Mine was absolutely indispensable.", "NTA - it would break him? To see YOU in pain and delivering a baby, oh please.", "NTA. In my opinion, it's an event you share together, at least when it is possible anyway. Especially when the one in labour is requesting it. I would be disappointed if my husband opted out of being in there with me if he had the chance.\n\nI would try talking about it again. Express what it would mean to you. Maybe there is a middle ground? Maybe there is a way of him being in there without having to see what he doesn't want to see?\n\nAlso: Congratulations with the pregnancy!", "NTA, after the delivery, it'll be \"Oh change the poop it makes me gag\", \"Eww, there's sick, you do it!\"  The man needs to get his shit together and be there for his family instead of thinking of his own selfish arse.", "My husband faints at the sight of blood. Guess what? He was there for our son\u2019s birth. He focused on me and did not look down past my midsection. \n\nTell your husband that this is one time in your life it is most definitely all about you and your comfort. He is being incredibly selfish. \n\nNTA. \n\nFrankly, I\u2019d have made him move out. And when the flying monkeys were loosed, I would very clearly tell everyone that husband is not prepared to support me during pregnancy and childbirth. But that\u2019s just me.", "NTA. Honestly, this is why I get frustrated with all the horror stories about birth. They don't help anyone when they aren't balanced with the stories of easy, normal births. There was no screaming, very little blood, and very little pain for me. It's not like a TV show. \n\nYou and your husband both need to do a lot more research into labor and delivery. Knowing what to expect, physically, emotionally, and mentally makes such a difference in your confidence and abilities when the day comes.\n\nGoing into this moment with no information is a recipe for disaster. Listen to some positive pregnancy stories, read a few books on the subject, and arm yourselves. You will both need it.\n\nAs a compromise, could you ask him to try to stay in the room, but give him permission to walk away for a break if he gets overwhelmed? Could you reach have a second person in the hospital (but not in the room) for support? He might need sorry just as much as you. If you have a long labour, he might need someone to remind him to eat and drink, just like you will.\n\nNo matter how this turns out, I'm sending you easy labour and delivery vibes.", "NTA. At all.\n\nThis is kind of unreal, IMO. Your husband doesn\u2019t want to be by your side for the life changing moment of childbirth? Maybe you don\u2019t want to fight about it, but truly you should throw your cards on the table; he should be there without question. \n\nNo time for weak sauce husbandos.", "NTA. Tell him that YOU don't want to be there, either, but the two of you signed up for it when you made the baby. Does he think YOU want to experience contractions (they hurt) or lose sleep if labor is long? He has to suck it up. \n\nThis outrages me. Sorry. I shouldn't feel this strongly for a stranger. But WTF?? You don't want to see blood?? What a baby. No one WANTS to see blood. No one WANTS to see their partner in pain. But he needs to support you.", "As a person who just had a baby I would reconsider this relationship. This is the most vulnerable you will ever be in your entire life and if he can't step up for the birth he's not going to step up to what's to come. It's dirty, exhausting, sad and amazing. I literally can't believe that there are men who are like this. You need him there. This is mind blowing to me. I'm sorry NTA", "As someone who had their first child two months ago.. if my partner refused to be in the room, it would have been the end of the relationship for us and between him and our child. Those first few moments when a baby is born are so precious and something that can never be replaced. You are about to go through a huge physical and emotional experience and he needs to grow a pair and support you and your little one because right now the most important person is YOU and your wants and needs for labour and delivery.", "NTA, if he can\u2019t handle it, he shouldn\u2019t have gotten you pregnant. He doesn\u2019t want to see you go through that, unconcerned about how you actually feel going through it. That\u2019s not something I could get over.", "NTA but he is. He\u2019s not comfortable seeing you in agony? Imagine what\u2019s it like being that person\u2026\n\nYou got married for sickness and health! This is part of the deal, buddy. Being there in their worst and BEST moments - and let\u2019s be clear - welcoming your baby into the world is 1000% one of the rarest and best moments of your life. Yes there can be trauma and risk. And it\u2019s scary. That\u2019s why you do it together. In that moment your needs matter most PERIOD. And you said you need your partner in life there for you. \n\nI highly recommend you both take child birth preps classes together at the hospital (almost every hospital you choose to give birth at has them) or through your OBGYN. \n\nAnd may I also suggest searching out a doula? Usually a doula doesn\u2019t count as your \u201cbirthing team\u201d if they are certified. Many hospitals are also starting to encourage them or have some on staff. A doula will help ease and coach you through a lot of the anxiety before hand, offer a lot of supportive techniques for your husband to practice so he DOESNT feel useless. Especially being in charge of tools like a birthing ball or a Robozo. And with a doula you can practice a lot of the techniques you\u2019ll use at home before the birth (many hospitals encourage people to wait through stage 1 at home if possible due to Covid and also better at home management techniques) and with your first it typically takes a loooong time to come \n\nNote/ : y\u2019all I know not every first birth is typical so no need to flood my comments\n\nHonestly he sounds scared and that\u2019s okay but that doesn\u2019t excuse him being selfish. Education and familiarization are the best tools to combat fear based decisions. I guarantee if he\u2019s not there he will vastly regret it for the rest of his life. I\u2019ve yet to meet a dad that didn\u2019t regret being there - and I\u2019ve met plenty who were just as terrified to be there. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some? I bet there\u2019s a lot more dads however that regret not being there.", "He\u2019s watched too much TV and movie renditions of childbirth. It\u2019s not nearly that dramatic. They will not make him watch the details as they happen. His best spot will be by your head, holding your hand, telling you he loves you. We\u2019ve had 2.  One was a C section. If there are any problems, he\u2019ll be upset with himself for not being there. \n\nYou are absolutely not the asshole. He needs to man up.", "INFO: does he faint at the sight of blood?", "NTA but he is. He has already decided what childbirth will look like and that he will opt out without ever even trying. Does he think you would have the same option? To just opt out of showing up to the birth of your child? If the screaming and fluids are too much for him, what\u2019s his plan when it comes to actually taking care of the baby?? Because babies scream, shit, piss, barf, and scream some more on loop for months at a time. Will that all be your responsibility since of the \u201cintensity\u201d is too much for him and because he will be at a \u201cdisadvantage\u201d compared to you? He says he\u2019ll break seeing you in pain?! Does he think you magically won\u2019t be in pain if he doesn\u2019t show up?? Or does he think he just gets to leave you there and pretend the childbirth part isn\u2019t happening to make himself feel comfy and good? This man had absolutely no business getting you pregnant if he cannot handle the realities of childbirth. I cannot imagine having a baby with a person who didn\u2019t want to see their child\u2019s first moments on earth. I\u2019m so sorry this is the father of your child.", "NTA..I was down there at the business end giving a running commentary. It seems describing what the butthole is doing is considered crossing some imaginary line!  :) Farm/ranch folks do have a bit different outlook on things like that though.", "Funny, a couple weeks ago your husband made a thread asking if he\u2019s TA.", "NTA\n\nI was the screamer down the hall and my husband never once thought of leaving my side, with either of ours. He stood by my head the whole time.\n\nHowever, you may need to ask someone to be there as well as your husband so you know you have a familiar supportive loved one for you since he seems to think his part gets a pause during the painful part.", "Nta \n\nHe has to grow a pair and be there for you and this kid.", "NTA, I was there for my two kids births. It\u2019s what a man should do. Unless something goes wrong, there isn\u2019t a lot of blood or \u201cscreaming.\u201d  There\u2019s grunting and breathing and pushing. \n\nI was there by my wife\u2019s side, but not down in her privates. Those were relatively covered and that\u2019s for the trained professionals to deal with. \n\nI wasn\u2019t sure how I\u2019d feel cutting the umbilical cord, but they made it as easy as possible. Hemostats were placed on two ends and I was handed surgical scissors and \u201csnip.\u201d\n\nThis is a conversation you need to have with your hubs and your OB or midwife. Surely y\u2019all can come up with a plan for your husband to be there and not feel all grossed out.", "NTA. I love that women are expected to go through the actual pain of childbirth but it's somehow unreasonable to then expect the father-to-be to support us through it.", "NTA. My husband can\u2019t handle blood or other people in pain, but he was there for our daughter\u2019s birth last year. He even held a leg when I pushed and saw her crown. He didn\u2019t want to cut the cord but he did. He didn\u2019t want to hold her with viscera on her skin but he did. Now they\u2019re inseparable.", "NTA but it sounds like it would be a good idea to get to the bottom of why he thinks he won't be a help (and a hinderence instead) and go from there. My husband has been willing to be with me during medical procedures I had to be awake for, but the last one (removing a bc implant that turned and was deeper in my arm than normal) made them light headed and they had to sit away from me. It may just be a case of figuring out the limits and having a plan if your husband feels he is going to pass out. If it's more of a fear of seeing you that vulnerable and not being able to help it may be a case of reiterating that his presence is helpful and that you may need him to be sure x, y, or z part of your birth plan is followed.", "Nta.  You husband is a disgrace, he should be by your side during the birth.", "NTA and I hope before you do anything else, you talk to him. Perhaps you can both go speak to your doctor (or midwife or whatever professional is helping you). Or you can speak alone to get your bearings, then see about what's next.\n\nYour husband may have a skewed view of what happens in childbirth, especially if he thinks it's all screaming and blood and agony. Yes, of course, some women have difficult births that involve surgery or emergency c-sections. But many don't. I had an epidural for one and a c-section for my second; neither involved screaming or agony. I can't speak to the blood, as I couldn't see. My husband was there for both.\n\nI think first off your husband needs a more accurate version of what happens during childbirth. Then, there needs to be a serious discussion of what he can handle. Some people are really bad around medical procedures; if he's one of them, you need to plan for that. It wouldn't help anyone for him to genuinely freak out or pass out while you're giving birth. However, if he's just got pop culture stuff in his head, it'd be good to get it out, and he probably doesn't need to see anything he doesn't want to.\n\nCongrats on the baby, and good luck.", "NTA!!! He is!", "NTA \n\nThis speaks of a serious lack of education in your partner\u2019s role during child birth. I would suggest sitting down and discussing why he has a vital role during child birth and what your expectations are. You need to research this yourself beforehand and make sure you understand your needs.", "NTA. I\u2019ve seen 3 babies come out of my wife from varying angles right by her side. What she\u2019s going through GREATLY outweighs anything he\u2019s going through. Tell him to man up and hold his wife\u2019s hand while she\u2019s pushes out their child.", "\"Not everyone can handle childbirth\" and he expects you to without him? NTA you are going to be pushing a human being out of your body. you are whats important here  you deserve love and support during one of the most painful experiences in many people lives. he doesnt have to look if he doesnt want to see blood", "When watching someone give birth is more difficult than giving birth, JFC. What is plan when the baby is shitting and peeing and puking and crying for hours on end?\n\nShow him this thread. NTA.", "Where do ya'll find these weak men?", "I'm probably going to get downvoted, but NAH. It's reasonable for you to have been expecting him to be there, but you didn't actually check with him before now. He has some legitimate concerns about being there because he feels like he is not equipped to be your best support person. It's not that he doesn't want to be there to support you, it's that he wants to ensure you have the best support you can get. He's right, birth is intense and bloody, and it's not a comfortable experience for anyone. His heart is in the right place.\n\nYou two need to sit down, talk through your respective anxieties, and try to work through it. Maybe he'll feel better if someone else, like your mom, is there with him, so that way if he is incapacitated you won't be alone. You both clearly care about each other, it's just a matter of finding the best way to be there for each other right now.", "NAH Honestly, this post sounds almost exactly like a recent-ish post by the father in the scenario. I'm giving the same judgment and recommendations here as I did there.\n\nYou both have legitimate worries and fears. You also both have too much time and so are creating things to be fearful of. Your lives are about to change radically, and that's no doubt fueling a lot of this.\n\nPlease encourage your husband to do 2 things. First, sit down with your doctor and explain the situation. Your doctor has seen this before \\[probably on a daily basis\\] and so won't be surprised. He'll be able to walk your husband through what will happen in the room and what he'll actually be seeing when there. Your doctor may even be able to suggest a calming medication he could take the day of the event.\n\nSecond, please have him see a therapist to learn some behavioral techniques that can help him manage his fear reasonably. He won't want to miss this day, and some easy steps on his part can help ensure he's there for you during the whole event.", "NAH\n\nHe's terrified from the Hollywood image. And his anxiety is valid if he's genuinely scared.\nYou need your support. He is your go to. You don't need him for strength as much as comfort.\n\nCalmly explain he can sit by the bed, aimed at you. You just need him to hold your hand and repeat the nurses verbatim to you. Not to be a cheerleader or catcher. You will be in pain but it will be alone in pain without him.\n\nMake arrangements if he just can't do it. Some men (AND MOTHERS) can't do it. My mama said she couldn't come, she's here for when we get home. She was the first visitor, but I couldn't be mad at her. She said she can't see her babies like that. She was embarrassed and cried, but I rather have someone there then none at all. Nurses are strong, experienced, and will not let you down. Congrats.", "I'd say either NAH or ESH, depending. It's perfectly reasonable that you want him there. Is he usually squeamish? There are people who pass out or vomit watching someone in labor, and the last thing you want is for that to happen. Most of the time when people pass out it's from low blood sugar, either because they've forgotten to eat with all the excitement or because they purposefully don't eat if their laboring partner can't. You need to talk to each other, look up advice from nurses and birth coaches, talk to your OB.", "NAH.\n\nIt sounds like he has a lot of anxiety and fear about this as well. Have you two sat down together and had a conversation about the childbirth experience with your doctor? Do you have a plan for the birth? Has he been involved with any of it? Education and information can alleviate fears and anxiety. If you have the time and resources I would suggest booking an appointment to make a birthing plan and learn about options. Labor pain can be effectively controlled through an epidural or other options. Depending on facilities if your husband stays above your waist he won't see hardly any of the fluids or trauma involved. \n\nNeither you nor your husband are AH here, because there's a ton of fear and anxiety over becoming parents. It sounds to me like you both need a guide to help you through this so you can learn to work together more effectively.", "Yes this relatively new business of forcing new fathers to be present at the birth is at best downright inconsiderate and at worst extramely damaging to the relationship and to the new father too if it comes down to it. If he wants to be there, well and good. If he doesn't then he has a right not to be. He is also a person with thoughts and feelings and wishes and strengths and weaknesses. He is not a machine to prop you up simply because you say so.", "If him being there would mean that much then yeah, he should be there for you. But if he passes out or something, take ownership of the fact it was your wish for him to be there. Us men aren't made for childbirth, mentally or physically", "NTA... However please consider that even if it doesn't \"break\" him, he might pass out...\nYou know that there are men that have been in the army their whole lives and tough like hell but refuse to go to the dentist because they are terrified of needles. He doesn't care for bullets though...\n\nThe thing is that there is a reason he doesn't want to be in there. His lose if you ask me...  \nBut in my experience, it's better to have someone with you who is ready to face that kind of things. \nI know you want your husband to support you, but it's better to have your mother or sister who will not pass out when they see some blood and if needed, in emergency they will be able to support you and defend your best interest. \n\nThis man knows he is not mentally ready to be there and he told you the way he could, without breaking his dignity and telling you that he is scared. And yes it might \"break\" him and his self esteem to see how much pain you go through, knowing he wouldn't survive that himself. Some Men don't take well realisation that their woman might be tougher than them. \n\nLet him wait outside and insted, have someone who knows what you are going through and if necessary comfort you and protect you.\n\n Like keep medical stuff from treating you roughly. Like when my friend was giving birth with her 1st baby she was alone and the staff was very impatient with her. Even shouting at her to stop screaming that she was not the first mother to give birth... \nThe second time she had me inside and the same nurse many times politely tried to explain to her that screaming was messing up her breathing and she needed to push with her lungs full with air. That way pushes are easier and better. I can't say if she was telling the truth but she never even once dared to raise her voice at my friend while I was there. \nPassed out man on the floor can't keep an eye on you and tend to your needs. \nAlso other women with you means way better pictures of the moment when you get to hold your baby for the first time...\n\nWhatever his reason and arguments are for not wanting to be there with you, let him stay out. Yes it's a let down but it's better for your own good in the long run... \n\nWish you easy labour and happy motherhood \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdited for spelling mistakes.", "NAH\n\nIt's understandable that you don't want to be alone when you give birth to your child because it can be scary and stressful doing it on your own. \n\nYour husband has valid reasons as to why he thinks he shouldn't be in there and he was up front and honest about it. \n\nI honestly think that you two should have a conversation about it another time.

You can't force someone's presence in a hospital room.\n\nThere is an intrinsic disparity during the pregnancy and labour process: the woman is the one doing the whole thing for ~ 9 months. As a consequence, she is the one ultimately deciding about the procedure. Because we aren't only animals guided by istincts and we have a different (and hopefully based on love and trust) sistem of family, with the male supporting the female during this procedure. If men can't put up with this, they should start developing their system of being the ones carrying babies... As of now, this disparity can't be overcome. It would be the same final decision \"with reverse roles\" with men being the ones carrying the baby \ud83d\ude05 as of now, men only needs to support their wifes/partners respecting their need of support (the most frequent scenario) or request to be alone (rare but a possibility).

OP's husband isn't an asshole for not reading her mind and knowing how important this is to her when he was never told in the first place.\n\nA kid being sick or getting hurt is a lot different than someone going through an intense, hours long medical procedure.

But again, instead of trying to figure out a plan to compromise (coming for labor then stepping out for delivery, staying at the head of bed, staying back away from the bed, multiple support people, etc), he's increasing her stress by simply refusing to go.

It's possible, but it could also just be anxiety. It's possible that maybe he doesn't know about other options that would allow him to be in the room because men are not educated on how pregnancy and childbirth really works. That's why they should talk to each other - if it is just anxiety they can work through it together, if it's weaponized incompetence then further discussion should reveal that and OP can react accordingly."]}
