He hesitated a lot and then proceeded to explain to me that, basically, he doesn\u2019t want to be there. He said he thinks he won\u2019t be of any use because he\u2019ll be freaking out with all the screaming and blood and intensity and he would end up being a disadvantage.

Get signed up for childbirth classes ASAP.", "NTA- tell your husband that he can stand or sit by your head and doesn\u2019t need to watch or see any blood or baby crowning. I blame the media, for reinforcing this belief that men are unable to handle watching women give birth.", "Of course you assumed he'd be there.  What an odd thing for him to assume he wouldn't.   I am sure he didn't mind all the screaming when the baby was being put in you,  I'm sure he can handle the screaming when the baby comes out.  You are a team, him not being there is insane.   He has a huge role, emotional support.   If he can't handle it, he's not dad or husband material.", "So your husband just told you he'll be more occupied with himself and his own likes and preferences than with his wife who is trying to push a child out. And from all this, the part I find the most baffling is that you explicitly told him how he'll be of use by just being there to make your nerves calm.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. Does he live in the 1950s? Did he just imagine he\u2019d be at home handing out cigars to his friends and sipping whisky? \n\nI can\u2019t imagine being so selfish that I\u2019d leave my wife to have OUR child alone. Childbirth can be incredibly traumatic for the woman and having the person she wants there can mitigate those fears. \n\nWhat a complete d bag.", "NTA\n\nNice that your husband, who hasn't had to go through anything for this pregnancy other than have sex, gets to opt out of the birth. Sucks to be you, wife, that you can't just choose not to be there. \ud83d\ude44 \n\nMy husband was super useless during the births of both of our kids, but he was still there. One emergency surgery, one natural. Either way, he hates hospitals, hates blood, hates my pain, but was there for all 27 and 49 hours of labor for each kid. Come on, OP's husband. Do better for your family. \n\nI also wholeheartedly recommend a doula. Mine was absolutely indispensable.", "NTA - it would break him? To see YOU in pain and delivering a baby, oh please.", "NTA. In my opinion, it's an event you share together, at least when it is possible anyway. Especially when the one in labour is requesting it. I would be disappointed if my husband opted out of being in there with me if he had the chance.\n\nI would try talking about it again. Express what it would mean to you. Maybe there is a middle ground? Maybe there is a way of him being in there without having to see what he doesn't want to see?\n\nAlso: Congratulations with the pregnancy!", "NTA, after the delivery, it'll be \"Oh change the poop it makes me gag\", \"Eww, there's sick, you do it!\"  The man needs to get his shit together and be there for his family instead of thinking of his own selfish arse.", "My husband faints at the sight of blood. Guess what? He was there for our son\u2019s birth. He focused on me and did not look down past my midsection. \n\nTell your husband that this is one time in your life it is most definitely all about you and your comfort. He is being incredibly selfish. \n\nNTA. \n\nFrankly, I\u2019d have made him move out. And when the flying monkeys were loosed, I would very clearly tell everyone that husband is not prepared to support me during pregnancy and childbirth. But that\u2019s just me.", "NTA. Honestly, this is why I get frustrated with all the horror stories about birth. They don't help anyone when they aren't balanced with the stories of easy, normal births. There was no screaming, very little blood, and very little pain for me. It's not like a TV show. \n\nYou and your husband both need to do a lot more research into labor and delivery. Knowing what to expect, physically, emotionally, and mentally makes such a difference in your confidence and abilities when the day comes.\n\nGoing into this moment with no information is a recipe for disaster. Listen to some positive pregnancy stories, read a few books on the subject, and arm yourselves. You will both need it.\n\nAs a compromise, could you ask him to try to stay in the room, but give him permission to walk away for a break if he gets overwhelmed? Could you reach have a second person in the hospital (but not in the room) for support? He might need sorry just as much as you. If you have a long labour, he might need someone to remind him to eat and drink, just like you will.\n\nNo matter how this turns out, I'm sending you easy labour and delivery vibes.", "NTA. At all.\n\nThis is kind of unreal, IMO. Your husband doesn\u2019t want to be by your side for the life changing moment of childbirth? Maybe you don\u2019t want to fight about it, but truly you should throw your cards on the table; he should be there without question. \n\nNo time for weak sauce husbandos.", "NTA. Tell him that YOU don't want to be there, either, but the two of you signed up for it when you made the baby. Does he think YOU want to experience contractions (they hurt) or lose sleep if labor is long? He has to suck it up. \n\nThis outrages me. Sorry. I shouldn't feel this strongly for a stranger. But WTF?? You don't want to see blood?? What a baby. No one WANTS to see blood. No one WANTS to see their partner in pain. But he needs to support you.", "As a person who just had a baby I would reconsider this relationship. This is the most vulnerable you will ever be in your entire life and if he can't step up for the birth he's not going to step up to what's to come. It's dirty, exhausting, sad and amazing. I literally can't believe that there are men who are like this. You need him there. This is mind blowing to me. I'm sorry NTA", "As someone who had their first child two months ago.. if my partner refused to be in the room, it would have been the end of the relationship for us and between him and our child. Those first few moments when a baby is born are so precious and something that can never be replaced. You are about to go through a huge physical and emotional experience and he needs to grow a pair and support you and your little one because right now the most important person is YOU and your wants and needs for labour and delivery.", "NTA, if he can\u2019t handle it, he shouldn\u2019t have gotten you pregnant. He doesn\u2019t want to see you go through that, unconcerned about how you actually feel going through it. That\u2019s not something I could get over.", "NTA but he is. He\u2019s not comfortable seeing you in agony? Imagine what\u2019s it like being that person\u2026\n\nYou got married for sickness and health! This is part of the deal, buddy. Being there in their worst and BEST moments - and let\u2019s be clear - welcoming your baby into the world is 1000% one of the rarest and best moments of your life. Yes there can be trauma and risk. And it\u2019s scary. That\u2019s why you do it together. In that moment your needs matter most PERIOD. And you said you need your partner in life there for you. \n\nI highly recommend you both take child birth preps classes together at the hospital (almost every hospital you choose to give birth at has them) or through your OBGYN. \n\nAnd may I also suggest searching out a doula? Usually a doula doesn\u2019t count as your \u201cbirthing team\u201d if they are certified. Many hospitals are also starting to encourage them or have some on staff. A doula will help ease and coach you through a lot of the anxiety before hand, offer a lot of supportive techniques for your husband to practice so he DOESNT feel useless. Especially being in charge of tools like a birthing ball or a Robozo. And with a doula you can practice a lot of the techniques you\u2019ll use at home before the birth (many hospitals encourage people to wait through stage 1 at home if possible due to Covid and also better at home management techniques) and with your first it typically takes a loooong time to come \n\nNote/ : y\u2019all I know not every first birth is typical so no need to flood my comments\n\nHonestly he sounds scared and that\u2019s okay but that doesn\u2019t excuse him being selfish. Education and familiarization are the best tools to combat fear based decisions. I guarantee if he\u2019s not there he will vastly regret it for the rest of his life. I\u2019ve yet to meet a dad that didn\u2019t regret being there - and I\u2019ve met plenty who were just as terrified to be there. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some? I bet there\u2019s a lot more dads however that regret not being there.", "He\u2019s watched too much TV and movie renditions of childbirth. It\u2019s not nearly that dramatic. They will not make him watch the details as they happen. His best spot will be by your head, holding your hand, telling you he loves you. We\u2019ve had 2.  One was a C section. If there are any problems, he\u2019ll be upset with himself for not being there. \n\nYou are absolutely not the asshole. He needs to man up.", "INFO: does he faint at the sight of blood?", "NTA but he is. He has already decided what childbirth will look like and that he will opt out without ever even trying. Does he think you would have the same option? To just opt out of showing up to the birth of your child? If the screaming and fluids are too much for him, what\u2019s his plan when it comes to actually taking care of the baby?? Because babies scream, shit, piss, barf, and scream some more on loop for months at a time. Will that all be your responsibility since of the \u201cintensity\u201d is too much for him and because he will be at a \u201cdisadvantage\u201d compared to you? He says he\u2019ll break seeing you in pain?! Does he think you magically won\u2019t be in pain if he doesn\u2019t show up?? Or does he think he just gets to leave you there and pretend the childbirth part isn\u2019t happening to make himself feel comfy and good? This man had absolutely no business getting you pregnant if he cannot handle the realities of childbirth. I cannot imagine having a baby with a person who didn\u2019t want to see their child\u2019s first moments on earth. I\u2019m so sorry this is the father of your child.", "NTA..I was down there at the business end giving a running commentary. It seems describing what the butthole is doing is considered crossing some imaginary line!  :) Farm/ranch folks do have a bit different outlook on things like that though.", "Funny, a couple weeks ago your husband made a thread asking if he\u2019s TA.", "NTA\n\nI was the screamer down the hall and my husband never once thought of leaving my side, with either of ours. He stood by my head the whole time.\n\nHowever, you may need to ask someone to be there as well as your husband so you know you have a familiar supportive loved one for you since he seems to think his part gets a pause during the painful part.", "Nta \n\nHe has to grow a pair and be there for you and this kid.", "NTA, I was there for my two kids births. It\u2019s what a man should do. Unless something goes wrong, there isn\u2019t a lot of blood or \u201cscreaming.\u201d  There\u2019s grunting and breathing and pushing. \n\nI was there by my wife\u2019s side, but not down in her privates. Those were relatively covered and that\u2019s for the trained professionals to deal with. \n\nI wasn\u2019t sure how I\u2019d feel cutting the umbilical cord, but they made it as easy as possible. Hemostats were placed on two ends and I was handed surgical scissors and \u201csnip.\u201d\n\nThis is a conversation you need to have with your hubs and your OB or midwife. Surely y\u2019all can come up with a plan for your husband to be there and not feel all grossed out.", "NTA. I love that women are expected to go through the actual pain of childbirth but it's somehow unreasonable to then expect the father-to-be to support us through it.", "NTA. My husband can\u2019t handle blood or other people in pain, but he was there for our daughter\u2019s birth last year. He even held a leg when I pushed and saw her crown. He didn\u2019t want to cut the cord but he did. He didn\u2019t want to hold her with viscera on her skin but he did. Now they\u2019re inseparable.", "NTA but it sounds like it would be a good idea to get to the bottom of why he thinks he won't be a help (and a hinderence instead) and go from there. My husband has been willing to be with me during medical procedures I had to be awake for, but the last one (removing a bc implant that turned and was deeper in my arm than normal) made them light headed and they had to sit away from me. It may just be a case of figuring out the limits and having a plan if your husband feels he is going to pass out. If it's more of a fear of seeing you that vulnerable and not being able to help it may be a case of reiterating that his presence is helpful and that you may need him to be sure x, y, or z part of your birth plan is followed.", "Nta.  You husband is a disgrace, he should be by your side during the birth.", "NTA and I hope before you do anything else, you talk to him. Perhaps you can both go speak to your doctor (or midwife or whatever professional is helping you). Or you can speak alone to get your bearings, then see about what's next.\n\nYour husband may have a skewed view of what happens in childbirth, especially if he thinks it's all screaming and blood and agony. Yes, of course, some women have difficult births that involve surgery or emergency c-sections. But many don't. I had an epidural for one and a c-section for my second; neither involved screaming or agony. I can't speak to the blood, as I couldn't see. My husband was there for both.\n\nI think first off your husband needs a more accurate version of what happens during childbirth. Then, there needs to be a serious discussion of what he can handle. Some people are really bad around medical procedures; if he's one of them, you need to plan for that. It wouldn't help anyone for him to genuinely freak out or pass out while you're giving birth. However, if he's just got pop culture stuff in his head, it'd be good to get it out, and he probably doesn't need to see anything he doesn't want to.\n\nCongrats on the baby, and good luck.", "NTA!!! He is!", "NTA \n\nThis speaks of a serious lack of education in your partner\u2019s role during child birth. I would suggest sitting down and discussing why he has a vital role during child birth and what your expectations are. You need to research this yourself beforehand and make sure you understand your needs.", "NTA. I\u2019ve seen 3 babies come out of my wife from varying angles right by her side. What she\u2019s going through GREATLY outweighs anything he\u2019s going through. Tell him to man up and hold his wife\u2019s hand while she\u2019s pushes out their child.", "\"Not everyone can handle childbirth\" and he expects you to without him? NTA you are going to be pushing a human being out of your body. you are whats important here  you deserve love and support during one of the most painful experiences in many people lives. he doesnt have to look if he doesnt want to see blood", "When watching someone give birth is more difficult than giving birth, JFC. What is plan when the baby is shitting and peeing and puking and crying for hours on end?\n\nShow him this thread. NTA.", "Where do ya'll find these weak men?", "I'm probably going to get downvoted, but NAH. It's reasonable for you to have been expecting him to be there, but you didn't actually check with him before now. He has some legitimate concerns about being there because he feels like he is not equipped to be your best support person. It's not that he doesn't want to be there to support you, it's that he wants to ensure you have the best support you can get. He's right, birth is intense and bloody, and it's not a comfortable experience for anyone. His heart is in the right place.\n\nYou two need to sit down, talk through your respective anxieties, and try to work through it. Maybe he'll feel better if someone else, like your mom, is there with him, so that way if he is incapacitated you won't be alone. You both clearly care about each other, it's just a matter of finding the best way to be there for each other right now.", "NAH Honestly, this post sounds almost exactly like a recent-ish post by the father in the scenario. I'm giving the same judgment and recommendations here as I did there.\n\nYou both have legitimate worries and fears. You also both have too much time and so are creating things to be fearful of. Your lives are about to change radically, and that's no doubt fueling a lot of this.\n\nPlease encourage your husband to do 2 things. First, sit down with your doctor and explain the situation. Your doctor has seen this before \\[probably on a daily basis\\] and so won't be surprised. He'll be able to walk your husband through what will happen in the room and what he'll actually be seeing when there. Your doctor may even be able to suggest a calming medication he could take the day of the event.\n\nSecond, please have him see a therapist to learn some behavioral techniques that can help him manage his fear reasonably. He won't want to miss this day, and some easy steps on his part can help ensure he's there for you during the whole event.", "NAH\n\nHe's terrified from the Hollywood image. And his anxiety is valid if he's genuinely scared.\nYou need your support. He is your go to. You don't need him for strength as much as comfort.\n\nCalmly explain he can sit by the bed, aimed at you. You just need him to hold your hand and repeat the nurses verbatim to you. Not to be a cheerleader or catcher. You will be in pain but it will be alone in pain without him.\n\nMake arrangements if he just can't do it. Some men (AND MOTHERS) can't do it. My mama said she couldn't come, she's here for when we get home. She was the first visitor, but I couldn't be mad at her. She said she can't see her babies like that. She was embarrassed and cried, but I rather have someone there then none at all. Nurses are strong, experienced, and will not let you down. Congrats.", "I'd say either NAH or ESH, depending. It's perfectly reasonable that you want him there. Is he usually squeamish? There are people who pass out or vomit watching someone in labor, and the last thing you want is for that to happen. Most of the time when people pass out it's from low blood sugar, either because they've forgotten to eat with all the excitement or because they purposefully don't eat if their laboring partner can't. You need to talk to each other, look up advice from nurses and birth coaches, talk to your OB.", "NAH.\n\nIt sounds like he has a lot of anxiety and fear about this as well. Have you two sat down together and had a conversation about the childbirth experience with your doctor? Do you have a plan for the birth? Has he been involved with any of it? Education and information can alleviate fears and anxiety. If you have the time and resources I would suggest booking an appointment to make a birthing plan and learn about options. Labor pain can be effectively controlled through an epidural or other options. Depending on facilities if your husband stays above your waist he won't see hardly any of the fluids or trauma involved. \n\nNeither you nor your husband are AH here, because there's a ton of fear and anxiety over becoming parents. It sounds to me like you both need a guide to help you through this so you can learn to work together more effectively.", "Yes this relatively new business of forcing new fathers to be present at the birth is at best downright inconsiderate and at worst extramely damaging to the relationship and to the new father too if it comes down to it. If he wants to be there, well and good. If he doesn't then he has a right not to be. He is also a person with thoughts and feelings and wishes and strengths and weaknesses. He is not a machine to prop you up simply because you say so.", "If him being there would mean that much then yeah, he should be there for you. But if he passes out or something, take ownership of the fact it was your wish for him to be there. Us men aren't made for childbirth, mentally or physically", "NTA... However please consider that even if it doesn't \"break\" him, he might pass out...\nYou know that there are men that have been in the army their whole lives and tough like hell but refuse to go to the dentist because they are terrified of needles. He doesn't care for bullets though...\n\nThe thing is that there is a reason he doesn't want to be in there. His lose if you ask me...  \nBut in my experience, it's better to have someone with you who is ready to face that kind of things. \nI know you want your husband to support you, but it's better to have your mother or sister who will not pass out when they see some blood and if needed, in emergency they will be able to support you and defend your best interest. \n\nThis man knows he is not mentally ready to be there and he told you the way he could, without breaking his dignity and telling you that he is scared. And yes it might \"break\" him and his self esteem to see how much pain you go through, knowing he wouldn't survive that himself. Some Men don't take well realisation that their woman might be tougher than them. \n\nLet him wait outside and insted, have someone who knows what you are going through and if necessary comfort you and protect you.\n\n Like keep medical stuff from treating you roughly. Like when my friend was giving birth with her 1st baby she was alone and the staff was very impatient with her. Even shouting at her to stop screaming that she was not the first mother to give birth... \nThe second time she had me inside and the same nurse many times politely tried to explain to her that screaming was messing up her breathing and she needed to push with her lungs full with air. That way pushes are easier and better. I can't say if she was telling the truth but she never even once dared to raise her voice at my friend while I was there. \nPassed out man on the floor can't keep an eye on you and tend to your needs. \nAlso other women with you means way better pictures of the moment when you get to hold your baby for the first time...\n\nWhatever his reason and arguments are for not wanting to be there with you, let him stay out. Yes it's a let down but it's better for your own good in the long run... \n\nWish you easy labour and happy motherhood \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdited for spelling mistakes.", "NAH\n\nIt's understandable that you don't want to be alone when you give birth to your child because it can be scary and stressful doing it on your own. \n\nYour husband has valid reasons as to why he thinks he shouldn't be in there and he was up front and honest about it. \n\nI honestly think that you two should have a conversation about it another time.

God help him if you child has a nose bed or falls over a has a gash- is he going to not bother parenting either incase?", "The dude doesnt have to even see anything, he can just be by your side, hold your hand and look at your face so he doesnt have to deal with blood. Its not like the doctor its gonna ask him for help for fucks sake", "I highly recommend taking a childbirth class together. Maybe if he is more informed and prepared he will feel more confident in his ability to support you. \n\nMy husband was an amazing birth partner because we knew as much as possible about what was coming, and we had practiced together. They had the moms put their hands in bowls of ice for 1-2 minutes, the length of a contraction, to practice their labor breathing and pain relief techniques, and their partners tried out different positions and activities to support them while they were doing it so that each couple understood what worked for them.\n\nMe and my husband discovered it really helped me to have him behind me supporting my back and hugging my shoulders. We spent a lot of my labor in that position, it really helped. \n\n \nI think it will be very telling to see how he responds to the suggestion that you need his support, and that being more prepared will help him figure out how to do that. It's fine if he doesn't know how to support you now, but it's not fine if he's not willing to learn how.", "Nta. But you have time. Talk to him and see if you two can come up with a birthing plan that takes both of your needs into consideration.

It might be better coming from a friend.", "NTA\n\nHe has a few months to watch birth videos, watch videos on how to be a support person during labor, and talk to real partners who support the birthing person. \n\nIf he can't do those things for you, I'd be very concerned that he also won't be a supportive partner and a good parent after the birth either. \n\nA newborn is also gross and loud and has gas pains. Is he gonna be too overwhelmed there too?", "Sorry to say OP, but he told you exactly who he and how he thinks about raising the child. Next, he won't want to be there for the diaper changing, sleeplessness nights and everything else. \n\nYou are going to be raising this child on your own pretty much..", "NTA. He helped make this baby, so it's time to step up and be there to support you. If the site of blood and stuff makes him squeamish, he doesn't have to look. He can sit and face towards you. And let him know it's not like the movies, all screaming and stuff for hours. Most of the time he will just be holding you and helping you find a comfy position while you labor.\n\nBut yeah, he's got a few months to prepare. Check and see if the place your giving birth has childbirth classes, and maybe get him a book on what to expect. YouTube also has helpful videos from parents on what to expect", "So he can\u2019t stand \u201cseeing you\u201d in pain, yet he\u2019s okay with CAUSING you extreme emotional pain by making you push his baby out without him there to support him? \n\nI\u2019m not exaggerating when I say I would get a divorce over this. He\u2019s basically telling you his needs are more important than yours, and that he comes first\u2026 even in your biggest time of need.\n\nNTA. Screw him.", "NTA at this point.  Take a birthing class together soon, let him start educating himself and ask about his options.  There are some great suggestions here, sitting near your head, a sheet to screen his view, etc.  Assure him you will let him choose these options.  Sounds like you are both anxious, start educating yourselves now so you can make a plan that works for both of you.\nI wonder if his dad buddies have been scaring him with talk of how bad some of it was?", "Nta, I feel bad for your husband but he can at least hold your hand and look at just you. Anything. You need him rn. There are ways to help keep him calm while he can be there. He should at least try.", "NTA", "NTA.  I delivered our first 2, and caught the next in the hospital.

Sac up, after you shack up.", "NTA\n\nI am extremely squeamish and cannot watch anything remotely gory or upsetting on TV. \n\nI was there for the births of all my children- admittedly I am the mother so it wasn\u2019t an option! \n\nHowever there are things you can do to manage it- I read up on stuff (NOT watched) so I knew what to expect and decided which bits I could have some control over- for example staff not telling me what was happening unless essential, not touching the baby\u2019s head (they seem to ask if you want to feel- NO!) and asking them to clean the baby off a bit before giving it to you. My husband stayed up the head end with me, I preferred this. He did cut though which I couldn\u2019t have done in a billion years. \n\nGiven he\u2019s not actually giving birth, he can use similar techniques but then simply step out the room if he needs a minute. Sorted.", "NTA, idk why but i have a feeling the whole \"seeing you in pain would break me\" thing is some way of trying to worm his way out of being there. if anything he should want to support you through the pain and watch as you stat to feel better and happier once you've had the baby", "He was happy enough to be there when the baby went in, so to speak. He shouldn't refuse to be there when it comes out. He can sit at the head end, not the business end, if it bothers him. You are NTA.", "NAH he doesn't understand his role in this situation and has a very \"Alien\" understanding of what labor is.\n\nHe needs to spend some time learning what labor looks like and needs to understand what he is supposed to be doing there. \n\nI was my wife's shield. My job was to learn about what would happen, pay attention to what the countless people who come in are doing and saying and step in to ask for explanations or where appropriate decency. And that's what I did, the hospital staff looked at me like an ape that learned to talk, but it gave me something to do and my wife appreciated it.", "No you're nta, he is ta. By the way, if you take meds during childbirth and everything goes normally, its not that bad. And he has the option not to look below your waist... it's not some sort of primal bloodbath. I suggest he figure out what it will actually be like.", "NTA\n\nRemind him he had the fun of making baby, he gets to be there to support you having baby.  \n\nIf isn\u2019t about being helpful, and if he faints, he won\u2019t be the first partner to do so.  They will move him out of the way and continue on.    \nWhen my youngest was born, my husband ended up perched on the bed, behind me, with his knee jammed into the spot on my back that needed support, while I practically squeezed his hand so hard I cut off the blood supply.  Now we laugh about it.  He was there to support me.  I would not have wanted wanted my mother there for that.", "NTA\n\nIf he\u2019s too squeamish for this, I have some bad news for him about how disgusting raising children can be in general.

He needs to educate himself by talking to your OB about realistic expectations of what happens during child birth or talk to other dads; reading a book wouldn\u2019t hurt. My husband simply just didn\u2019t look down during the process and looked at my head, lol. \n\nAlso, if you are getting an epidural, it\u2019s quite likely that there is no screaming or agony involved.

I can't opt out, so....  There are plenty of resources to help with the upcoming birth, look into them and pick which one is right for both of you. You can then decide if you really want him there or not.

He\u2019d probably end up staying with you and be glad he did.", "NTA I gave birth two days ago and my husband was an INCREDIBLE support!! There is tons he can do! Your husband is very selfish for not putting your needs before his in this situation. Sometimes in a marriage, you need to do things you don\u2019t want to do and he needs to buck up and do this for you. This child you have is BOTH of yours. I threw up a lot during labor and my husband normally always does this when others do it, but he didn\u2019t at all! He was so focused on supporting.", "NTA! He doesn't have to see anything, he can be sitting down facing away from all the mess and just focus on supporting you emotionally. You'll be in the same amount of pain either way, and the only difference will be having your life partner by your side to support you or not. Goodness, if my husband refused to be with me for the birth of our child I'd never get over it.", "Have you been to child birth classes?  There normally is not a lot of screaming. If you are screaming you are not pushing. Hubby should be by your head so blood should not be an issue.", "My husband is scared for hospitals.

He was my rock!\n\nWe had the agreement he wouldn't have to go with me if they had to do a C-section. Because we felt like that would be too much for him. So we had planned we'd call my mom of that would happen. But then my baby went in distress and they needed to do an emergency C-section. And he went with me without a second thought. Ofcourse it was scary for him. But leaving my side scared him more. (To be fair I never thought we'd call my mom for a C-section. I knew he'd be there for me in the heat of the moment. His love for me is stronger than his fears! But it was important for him to have an out if he needed it)", "Nta.  Not all birth is gory and dramatic, BTW.  Sometimes, yeah, it is, but not always.  Plus, it is pretty easy to not see anything if one so chooses.", "NTA and I cant believe I need to say this one outlaid but OP say you get a deathly illness and you will die in the hospital shitting in a pan and puking every hour... does that mean your husband will just let you die alone or worse make you argue and debate him as to why he should be there?", "NTA - He helped create the life and should be there any way you need him to support.", "NTA \n\nHasn't the been posted before almost verbatim?", "No, he's afraid.  Fear of losing you is a powerful driver I suspect.    I've seen that fear in my husband's eyes a few times and the best route is to educate and help him cope with the situation.  My husband cannot stand to see me in pain and I'd do anything to avoid that situation.    If he knows what to expect he does okay, but you put the pain that goes with something like that he has issues.", "NTA.\n\nMy response would have been \"And it would break me to be abandoned by the person who made vows to me at a time when I am possible the most vulnerable I have ever been in my life and in need of support and advocacy for both me and our child.\"\n\nHonestly...this would be a relationship dealbreaker for me.  I understand that plenty of women go it alone or with someone other than their SO, whether by choice or circumstance, and live to tell the tale.  I know I could do it, too.  But to flat out have the person who helped create that life choose to prioritize their own comfort in that moment would not be something I could get over.\n\nNot to forget that as a spouse, he is de facto decision maker unless you have legal paperwork designating someone else as your medical POA if something happens in that delivery room and you become unable to make decisions for yourself or the baby.  Him not being there and having to find him hanging out in the waiting room if that happens could be the difference between life or death.  And even when the situation is not that dire - I've known plenty of women in situations where they are too exhausted to advocate for themselves and undergo procedures they didn't want and weren't outlined in their birth plans (which I understand can't always be followed to the letter).  Everyone in every medical situation, not just childbirth, needs someone they can count on to be their advocate when needed and he basically just said \"Not it!\"\n\nPlease make sure you do a living will before you go into labor.  And if you legitimately believe that he is not capable of being the person who you need him to be in that room, please do ask your mom or someone you can count on and think long and hard about keeping a relationship with someone you cannot count on when you are vulnerable and prioritizes his own comfort instead.", "NTA. He should want to be there for the birth of his child! He can have a G rated view. There isn\u2019t always screaming and he doesn\u2019t have to see the blood.

She ended up having a cesarean and he was with her the whole way anyway.  Taking this approach he didn't feel pressured to be there and she had a backup in case he wasn't but he was definitely able to step up and want to do on the time came and it seems like your husband might be as well.", "I understand where this is coming from because of course you would expect a man that helped create the baby to watch the baby be born, BUT if you know that he has problems with stuff like this I would recommend getting someone who had gon through this process before or recommend the husband to go to therapy but not the regular do the one where they make you reach into a bag with fake blood with gloves on and then you pull your hands out and look at em and try not to gag or pass out till you get used to it.", "NTA-I would leave the marriage if my husband refused to be by my side.", "You're husband is so weak", "NTA.

Ma'am your husband just gave you an honest assessment of his ability to be helpful in a medical situation.

Just make sure he understands you expect him to be present before the interesting show gets started.", "NTA. If you can go through it he can manage to witness it. Tbh, there was no screaming and not much blood when I had a baby. I found a constant shushing as I breathed deeply was very helpful in keeping my nervous system regulated.

It\u2019s about you going through an extremely vulnerable and dangerous situation and wanting him there for comfort. As your partner he should be able to do this for you. My husband is one of the most squeamish people I know (like can\u2019t even watch a cartoon bleed) but he was there for the 40+ hours of birth which included sitting by my head for an emergency c-section.

He\u2019s going to want it to be over and you will end up concentrating on him. \n\nProbably should add that I\u2019ve got 3 kids. Partner was there for one and I had to give birth alone for the others due to no family support or babysitters etc. The others were so much easier to be honest.

Whatever it is, the fact that he got you pregnant and decided he can't be there for you is enough reason to eject him from your life.

It's normal these days for one's partner to be there for support during labor/delivery.

My husband was such a huge support through delivery and the NICU stay afterwards and it would have been terrifying and traumatic to go through it alone. Sure, he was nervous and scared himself, but he set it aside because I was the one going through labor and emergency surgery and he knew I needed him to step up and be strong for me. It might have ended our marriage if he didn't, and it definitely would have severely damaged it.\n\nIf your husband can't go through this with you, how is he going to handle all the other stressors that parenting and going through life throw your way?

He -does- need to do the work to overcome that fear. \n\nSome people faint at the sight of blood, and some shut down when their partner is in pain.

You're going to be a single mother even married to him.", "You're NTA for wanting him there, but he maybe right about not being the best person for the job if he's that squeamish about blood and stuff etc. The focus would go from you to him and that's NOT a good thing in the delivery room. You don't want the medical staff having to step over a passed out husband, or being distracted by him being concussed as he hits the floor.  \n\n\nYou're going to need support through a difficult process, and maybe a trusted family member like your mother or a close friend would serve you better. It sucks, and he's the one that will miss out on the amazing experience of seeing his baby born, but your welfare is priority and you need people around you that can help you through it, not someone fainting or throwing up as soon as the waters break!", "NTA \nYour Husband basically put his feelings as a greater priority to you. It sounds like he's trying to think logically   but his argument has several holes. Situations like this are bound to happen not exactly like op giving birth but let's say an accident, a death in the family etc. For a couple it means the world for the other to just be there no matter how messy the situation. If op's husband was in the hospital having surgery it would be cruel of op to not go because they don't like to see there partner in such a horrible state. At the end of the day couples will see the best and worst of each other, it's just as important to be there for them even at their most unpleasant state.", "NTA - So I was there for both of my kids births and the simple things to do if he has an issue is to NOT LOOK! You have a face and he can concentrate on that. Blood doesn't bother me, bodily functions aren't an issue, but there was an image I NEVER wanted to see, and that was my child's head coming out of my wife's genitals. It was an image of that area I didn't need because for me I have an active imagination and didn't know where my brain would go with that.\n\nHowever at the same time compromise is a thing and maybe instead of taking the scorched option like people are suggesting how about working towards something you could both be happy with.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA.

Will he change diapers and help clean the baby?  Or is that too much for him too?  He doesn't have to be there but his reasons are stupid and a bit cowardly.

I think he's ultimately wrong, but give him a minute to catch up and process it.", "NTA, but go together to talk with a doula to go through what giving birth usually is like, and why support is important. :) He probably has pretty warped image of it and how it can be very meaningful moment to all of you.", "NTA, but there are reasons why, historically, women managed childbirth and kept men away.  In Europe in the Middle Ages, at least, it was thought that men couldn't handle seeing the childbirth process.  Which was undoubtedly utter garbage for *most* men, but the occasional guy who decided to freak out would get in the way, and the women who managed the childbirth process had few enough resources without the added burden of a freaking guy. \n\nIf your guy self-identifies as a freak-outer, he won't be helping to calm your nerves.  Childbirth is something he will never personally experience, and even if he wants to be supportive, his own brain can trip him up.  I suggest reframing the question from \"How do I get my partner in the room with me when I give birth?\" to \"How can I find an uber-supportive person to help me with my anxieties when I give birth?\"  Because it's important to have support, but no one human will ever be able to give you the support you need in every single context.", "NTA as if you won\u2019t be freaking out pushing a football out of you lady business", "Oh dear NTA.

I have 5 kids my ex was in there 3 of the times my mom 2 of the times. Once the contractions started coming strong and while giving birth I didn't pay them much attention I was in to much pain.

I was surprised too when I found out I was squeamish because I have no problem watching ER or Grey's Anatomy. If you think someone should 'just grow up' that tells me you are probably someone who doesn't believe mental illnesses exist (even people who arent mentally ill can be squeamish, it is more of a physical response but anxiety can make it worse), or, in other words, you're just an uneducated idiot.

There's shades of gray sometimes. People saying he will be a bad father because he's afraid of blood/squeamish either don't understand different people/perspectives or don't care to understand. Not everyone can handle everything. It's funny because I don't know how people like this can resolve conflicts irl if they're so hyperbolic and unwilling to understand or compromise. One person said either he's there or he never gets to see the child!!!!!! Over 700 people upvoted weaponizing the child. Wow. I'll be downvoted into oblivion before I agree with that. That's sick. Feel free to divorce him if you want (I don't agree but whatever) but to weaponize the child is madness and way more harmful to the child than him being unable to witness the birth.\n\nAnyway with OPs husband, I'm wondering if they can do some type of modification to where he can be in the room but not witness the gory parts of childbirth.

Maybe there's some type of parenting group that will be of actual use instead of telling you that your partner will be a bad father.

I think he could be in the room with a sheet or something (like when they do c sections) but if he couldn't, I know that it's not for lack of trying/caring about me. That's why I'm hopeful OPs husband can find a creative solution to be there since it means a lot to OP.

My husband and I took a prenatal class and it was SO helpful for my husband and me. It helped him to prepare for what things would look and sound like - gave him practical things he could do. It gave me practical things I could do and even helped me understand more about breastfeeding so we had an easier start with that.

He can make it up to her in other ways. Also, stop saying \"shes pushing your freaking baby out.\" I am a woman, buddy, not you.

For some, watching their wife give birth doesn't make them sick, but then seeing an arm out of its socket does, etc. A squeamish reaction can surprise anyone, maybe not so much doctors and those who see that stuff regularly, but the average person who only is exposed to that in emergencies, which are not common. Unless youre a doctor, you can't really do much in a gory situation apart from calling the ambulance.There are many people who have kids and are great parents to them who could potentially have a bad reaction to a situation, but they don't know until they've been in it. How do you know if your response is fight/flight/freeze, etc. until you've been in it? You don't get to judge and act like you're better because your body's automatic response isn't to faint/puke."]}
