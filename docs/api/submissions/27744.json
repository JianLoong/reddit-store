Has she always been more caring about your brothers needs over yours? \nJust let your siblings know that you will not be attending often and will come maybe 1-2 times before baby and then only 8/10 months after.\nIf they want to see little one they will be the ones traveling.", "Be sure to extend the invitation to other relatives as well. She\u2019s going to try and control the narrative with them and say you don\u2019t want to see them etc.", "10/10 does she HEAR herself saying that it\u2019s too far, too much gas, etc., even as she demands you make yourself 1) uncomfortable 2) honestly more at risk for blood clots, etc., while also spending the same time and resources she refuses to to continue making this drive over and over again? Also, you likely would be so uncomfortable for the first 6-8 weeks after giving birth (and again, blood clots!) that sitting for that long would be awful even besides having to pull over to change and feed the baby on the way (there is no doing that in a moving car!) and then dealing with your mom\u2019s house. She is being so selfish. Even if she\u2019s not willing to make the drive, expecting you to sucks. Please make sure you\u2019re doing what\u2019s right for you and also consider finding a way to make sure you feel validated in this decision. It\u2019s the right one, NTA!", "You\u2019re the parent now.  You make the rules for your family.  Do yourself a favor and stop mollycoddling your mother. When your mom starts whining just cut the call short.  It\u2019s good practice for parenting where consistency is essential. NTA.", "Well I guess that will be up to them. \n\nRemind her- there\u2019s no blame or fault here. This is just logistics and baby safety.", "\u201cGosh, Mom, you\u2019re right. Turns out it *is* a very long drive, and the gas *is* expensive. Guess we\u2019ll have to cut way back on our visits.\u201d", "Yeah this sucks big time. I\u2019m not sure if this is new behavior (I\u2019m assuming no) but I\u2019d recommend some therapy to process through these dynamics, especially with that last sentence you just wrote. I\u2019m biased as a licensed therapist, but think that may be helpful to not only process old stuff, but the new that will emerge once bebe is born. \n\nAlso yes, glad you\u2019re prioritizing yourself and bebe on this; congrats on your pregnancy and hope you enjoy snuggling your little one when they arrive!", "Have the doctor be the \u201cbad guy.\u201d I bet they or the midwife will be more than happy to write you an official note or prescription. \u201cCannot drive or ride in a vehicle for X hours due to increased risk if Y.\u201d", "Well, yeah. Your mother is still treating you as a young dependent. Of course, any move to be less embedded will meet resistance.\n\nHowever, you now have a new family that's your priority. You don't ***request*** a change, and you don't agree to a schedule. Your own family needs you on most weekends, not your mother's family. You simply give your mother some advance notice from time to time when it's convenient for you to visit.", "Her lifestyle choices do not make it your burden to accommodate her.", "\"Well, now I'm about to become a mom in my own right, and I have to serve my own family\". \ud83d\udcaf \n\nYou are now growing a family of your own. You, your spouse and your new baby get to be the focus. You get to make the decisions here for what's best for your little family. \n\nI know all this must be weighing on you, but I think you're doing the right thing. Create your own traditions with your little one and partner. Make wonderful memories. \n\nAs a mom myself, I know it's hard to break out of pre established patterns. You want everyone to be happy. But it's okay to be selfish from time to time and focus on your own happiness. \n\nOne more thing you need to hear. You're doing great. And it's all going to be okay. Take care!", "Perfect.. had to go find that emoji \ud83d\udd96", "Exactly! The road goes both ways! There's no way you should have to always make the trip.", "Curious as to why ridiculous? Or was this a lazy post?", "I can see it now.  I just feel bad for the future child.  It might go like this.....  sorry little Jonny, no sports for you, mommy doesn't like driving,  or sorry we can't go see Grandpa cus it hurts my butt to sit in a car for an hour.   This kids future is already shot. Not from drugs, war, famine, but from laziness.", "Totally agree with you on all of the above.", "Thank you for the backup on this. I have trouble establishing and holding firm boundaries with family - especially my mother - because anything that isn't convenient for them tends to be regarded as 'selfish' and 'over-dramatic'. \n\nWhen it comes to my baby though, I'm not messing around, and I hope that I can respectfully yet firmly hold the line on this. It's too much driving, too often, and at the bare minimum I need my family to start picking up some of the slack when it comes to traveling for visits. \ud83d\ude97", "That's a good idea, thank you for suggesting that! Unfortunately my only other relatives besides my brothers are elderly and cannot drive (my brothers usually bring them out to my mom's place for the weekend). But, at very least, my brothers should know that the invitation is open for them to come and meet the baby.", "Hahaha exactly! \ud83d\ude02 Not to mention the fact that my husband and I both work full-time, while she's been retired for years. So it's not like we have the luxury of tons of free time to spend on the highway every other winter weekend! \ud83d\ude2c", "I thought it would be obvious, but it\u2019s ridiculous to call someone lazy because they don\u2019t want to spend 5 hours driving to see people who refuse to return the favor. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You got this! Holding boundaries, especially with your family, can be hard but you can do this!\n\nEspecially since your boundary is literally \u201cwe\u2019re not driving to you because it\u2019s too far being so pregnant/with a newborn and dealing with just giving birth.\u201d It\u2019s fair, it\u2019s reasonable. And i think it\u2019s an easier boundary to hold, especially since you really are putting yourself out there (for absolutely no reciprocation and for very flimsy reasons. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to pay the 5 hour round trip gas prices either). \n\nJust keep telling your mom you aren\u2019t able to see her until baby is x months old, or until you feel comfortable driving so far with him, whichever or whatever but you\u2019d enjoy a visit from her, especially while bubs is so young. You got this!", "See if your husband can be strong , sometimes it\u2019s hard for daughters to say no to their moms specially if that\u2019s how you\u2019ve been brought up. \nSo if your husband can just say No we won\u2019t travel and put our baby at rush then that might help.", "It\u2019s insane to me that the drive is \u201ctoo far\u201d and \u201ctoo much gas\u201d for her but somehow it\u2019s not too far and too much gas for you?? Like\u2026 what? I would honestly ask specifically about that like\u2026 why is it impossible for you to drive to me but I\u2019m being selfish if I refuse to drive to you?", "Thanks for the spirited debate.   The answer is simple.  Compromise.", "You mean like taking turns? The exact suggestion that OP made?", "Whatever floats your boat buddy I'm not wasting another second on this absolutely boring go no where conversation. Now shuffle off."]}
