{"id": 8155, "submission_id": "10k60uu", "title": "AITA for telling my fiance that he needs to pick a new best man?", "selftext": "My fiance, Kevin(M28) and I(F30) had initially planned to get married a few years ago but due to the fact that the world was falling apart we postponed it until things calmed down and our family felt safer at a big event. We've now set a date for this coming August and as we get closer more and more thoughts keep coming to me about how it should go. My biggest issue is that Kevin's best man is no longer his best man and is now his best woman. Kevin and Amy(MTF26) have been friends for a little over a decade and when they first met up until two years ago when our wedding was supposed to happen Amy identified as a man. Kevin and Amy have always had a very close almost sibling like relationship, Kevin had been kicked out by his mom at 17 and met Amy at work shortly after. She's been very close with him and he's told me multiple times that she is the closest thing he has to any family.\n\nInitially Amy had planned to not come out to Kevin until after the wedding but after finding out that the wedding was going to be delayed she came out to him. Without consulting me Kevin told her that he was fine with all of that and that if she was at a stage were she'd like to wear a dress when our wedding happened that he would find her a dress that matched the colors he had for his groomsmen. Amy has been medically transitioning for about a year or less now and Kevin told me that we need to find her a dress. I don't have a problem with Amy and I understand how close she is to Kevin but our wedding is largely for my very traditional family. Kevin has often said that this wedding isn't that important to him and that the only reason he's doing it is because it's important to me and my family. I know that my family would have a lot of issue with Amy which Im sure would bring a lot of unwanted or outright rude attention towards her. For this reason I've asked my fiance to choose someone else to be his best man and request that Amy attend as just a guest. This has lead to a large fight between the two of us with Kevin threatening to cancel the wedding if Amy can't be part of the wedding party because he wants someone from his family in it. Im trying to get him to understand the issues this will cause but I'm not sure he gets it.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy fiance, Kevin(M28) and I(F30) had initially planned to get married a few years ago but due to the fact that the world was falling apart we postponed it until things calmed down and our family felt safer at a big event. We've now set a date for this coming August and as we get closer more and more thoughts keep coming to me about how it should go. My biggest issue is that Kevin's best man is no longer his best man and is now his best woman. Kevin and Amy(MTF26) have been friends for a little over a decade and when they first met up until two years ago when our wedding was supposed to happen Amy identified as a man. Kevin and Amy have always had a very close almost sibling like relationship, Kevin had been kicked out by his mom at 17 and met Amy at work shortly after. She's been very close with him and he's told me multiple times that she is the closest thing he has to any family.\n\nInitially Amy had planned to not come out to Kevin until after the wedding but after finding out that the wedding was going to be delayed she came out to him. Without consulting me Kevin told her that he was fine with all of that and that if she was at a stage were she'd like to wear a dress when our wedding happened that he would find her a dress that matched the colors he had for his groomsmen. Amy has been medically transitioning for about a year or less now and Kevin told me that we need to find her a dress. I don't have a problem with Amy and I understand how close she is to Kevin but our wedding is largely for my very traditional family. Kevin has often said that this wedding isn't that important to him and that the only reason he's doing it is because it's important to me and my family. I know that my family would have a lot of issue with Amy which Im sure would bring a lot of unwanted or outright rude attention towards her. For this reason I've asked my fiance to choose someone else to be his best man and request that Amy attend as just a guest. This has lead to a large fight between the two of us with Kevin threatening to cancel the wedding if Amy can't be part of the wedding party because he wants someone from his family in it. Im trying to get him to understand the issues this will cause but I'm not sure he gets it. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Kevin and Amy deserve better", "YTA. I fully understand that it's hard with traditional families, but oh well. This is a man you love and his best friend, no matter what she looks like or how she identifies.

And if they do not attend would you and your fiance change the size of your wedding?", "YTA.\n\nWhat if Amy was afab? Would you have had a problem with a best woman?", "Another reason why I say not to have a wedding party. The ceremony is about you and your partner and not about who stands up there for you.

If your \u2018very traditional\u2019 (aka judgmental and transphobic) family has an issue with it, they can stay home. \n\nWhy would you want to celebrate with people like that anyway?", "YTA. She is his family. Whether she is a cis female or is trans, he is allowed to have a woman as his main attendant.  This is not even very revolutionary as more and more people have chosen someone of a different gender to stand up for them and support them on the day. A wedding is not supposed to be a spectacle to be staged - it is uniting two people with the support of the people who love them. This is the human being closest to Kevin in the world and you want to cut them out due to your family\u2019s bigotry and closed-mindedness.

Excluding Amy from your wedding ceremony prioritizes your family's opinion of other people over Amy's right to exist.

She's obviously done a lot for your fianc\u00e9, and means a lot to him, and you're going to make her a second class citizen in your life. It also demonstrates to your fianc\u00e9 that people in your life (including him) will have less love and respect from you based on what your family thinks.

It sounds like Amy is the most important person in his life aside from you and that SHOULD mean something to you. If it doesn\u2019t mean enough to rethink yours and your family\u2019s transphobic discomfort at this, then y\u2019all really shouldn\u2019t be getting married.", "And her fiance also considers Amy his chosen family.
