{"id": 8155, "submission_id": "10k60uu", "title": "AITA for telling my fiance that he needs to pick a new best man?", "selftext": "My fiance, Kevin(M28) and I(F30) had initially planned to get married a few years ago but due to the fact that the world was falling apart we postponed it until things calmed down and our family felt safer at a big event. We've now set a date for this coming August and as we get closer more and more thoughts keep coming to me about how it should go. My biggest issue is that Kevin's best man is no longer his best man and is now his best woman. Kevin and Amy(MTF26) have been friends for a little over a decade and when they first met up until two years ago when our wedding was supposed to happen Amy identified as a man. Kevin and Amy have always had a very close almost sibling like relationship, Kevin had been kicked out by his mom at 17 and met Amy at work shortly after. She's been very close with him and he's told me multiple times that she is the closest thing he has to any family.\n\nInitially Amy had planned to not come out to Kevin until after the wedding but after finding out that the wedding was going to be delayed she came out to him. Without consulting me Kevin told her that he was fine with all of that and that if she was at a stage were she'd like to wear a dress when our wedding happened that he would find her a dress that matched the colors he had for his groomsmen. Amy has been medically transitioning for about a year or less now and Kevin told me that we need to find her a dress. I don't have a problem with Amy and I understand how close she is to Kevin but our wedding is largely for my very traditional family. Kevin has often said that this wedding isn't that important to him and that the only reason he's doing it is because it's important to me and my family. I know that my family would have a lot of issue with Amy which Im sure would bring a lot of unwanted or outright rude attention towards her. For this reason I've asked my fiance to choose someone else to be his best man and request that Amy attend as just a guest. This has lead to a large fight between the two of us with Kevin threatening to cancel the wedding if Amy can't be part of the wedding party because he wants someone from his family in it. Im trying to get him to understand the issues this will cause but I'm not sure he gets it.

We've now set a date for this coming August and as we get closer more and more thoughts keep coming to me about how it should go. My biggest issue is that Kevin's best man is no longer his best man and is now his best woman. Kevin and Amy(MTF26) have been friends for a little over a decade and when they first met up until two years ago when our wedding was supposed to happen Amy identified as a man. Kevin and Amy have always had a very close almost sibling like relationship, Kevin had been kicked out by his mom at 17 and met Amy at work shortly after. She's been very close with him and he's told me multiple times that she is the closest thing he has to any family.\n\nInitially Amy had planned to not come out to Kevin until after the wedding but after finding out that the wedding was going to be delayed she came out to him. Without consulting me Kevin told her that he was fine with all of that and that if she was at a stage were she'd like to wear a dress when our wedding happened that he would find her a dress that matched the colors he had for his groomsmen. Amy has been medically transitioning for about a year or less now and Kevin told me that we need to find her a dress. I don't have a problem with Amy and I understand how close she is to Kevin but our wedding is largely for my very traditional family. Kevin has often said that this wedding isn't that important to him and that the only reason he's doing it is because it's important to me and my family. I know that my family would have a lot of issue with Amy which Im sure would bring a lot of unwanted or outright rude attention towards her. For this reason I've asked my fiance to choose someone else to be his best man and request that Amy attend as just a guest. This has lead to a large fight between the two of us with Kevin threatening to cancel the wedding if Amy can't be part of the wedding party because he wants someone from his family in it. Im trying to get him to understand the issues this will cause but I'm not sure he gets it. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Kevin and Amy deserve better", "YTA. I fully understand that it's hard with traditional families, but oh well. This is a man you love and his best friend, no matter what she looks like or how she identifies.

And if they do not attend would you and your fiance change the size of your wedding?", "YTA.\n\nWhat if Amy was afab? Would you have had a problem with a best woman?", "Another reason why I say not to have a wedding party. The ceremony is about you and your partner and not about who stands up there for you. Really wedding parties need to be a thing of the past and focus on the two getting married.

If your \u2018very traditional\u2019 (aka judgmental and transphobic) family has an issue with it, they can stay home. \n\nWhy would you want to celebrate with people like that anyway?", "YTA. She is his family. Whether she is a cis female or is trans, he is allowed to have a woman as his main attendant.  This is not even very revolutionary as more and more people have chosen someone of a different gender to stand up for them and support them on the day. A wedding is not supposed to be a spectacle to be staged - it is uniting two people with the support of the people who love them. This is the human being closest to Kevin in the world and you want to cut them out due to your family\u2019s bigotry and closed-mindedness.

Medical treatment for gender affirmation care is a very slow process. In the post, OP says Amy has been in the process for less than one year. It is likely that Amy still looks like a \"man\" in the eyes of OP's transphobic family. So, the transphobes will label Amy as a \"man in a dress.\" OP doesn't want to rock the boat, and in that she thinks she's being \"neutral\" and keeping the peace. She is not doing that, she is allowing transphobes to call the shots at her own wedding, at the expense of her fianc\u00e9's and Amy's personal welfare, and frankly she is being transphobic herself.\n\nI would disinvite the transphobes, personally. But to be TOTALLY honest, this is a non issue. Weddings are chaotic for the bride and groom. If it's a traditional big wedding, OP can easily hold a boundary and literally IGNORE every statement made, move on to the next table at the reception, and repeat.

Also, I experience gender euphoria far more often than dysphoria) and even those who do may not transition perfectly, meaning they may not be able to \"pass\" even after transition.

Many trans men and women look like the gender they have transitioned to and are treated as such.

I can only imagine how sad it must make you feel that your mom reacted this way. Your feelings are valid and you are who you are who you are attracted to shouldn't be a point of discussion and it doesn't add or reduce your value as a human being. What matters is how you treat others, your kindness and your heart\n.\nIt's not my place but I would suggest that you hold off the judgment on mom for a while because it could be an adjustment phase, especially because you were brought up in a very open minded household.\n\nYou see, when you have a child you kind of picture of what their whole life will be like, you have dreams for them and those dreams become your dreams. So when your child doesn't follow those dreams or change those plans sometimes it takes a little bit of time to come to terms with it. Just because we have those dreams for our children it doesn't mean they'll come true because it's not up to us to decide, it's our child's decision and we have to respect that.\n\nYou are your own person and are allowed and should follow your own path to be your authentic self. Still, it's normal and acceptable for mom to be sad, or even grieving the loss of what she thought would happen. Her feelings are as valid as yours, and she might need a little time to accept the new reality. Based on what you said I think she will come to terms rather quickly because she has so many friends in the LGBTQIA community. They'll be a great support for her and you.\n\nAlso, she might just be sad that part of the family won't accept your authentic self and you might be hurt and suffer because of their rejection, microaggressions and etc. We, mothers, worry about our children's happiness and hate to see them suffering and going through a rough time. When someone hurt our kids, mama bear wants to come out and start fixing things so she is probably thinking about the family members who might have an issue and figuring out a game plan. Her sadness, could have been \"how do I protect them if the family doesn't accept who they are?\". Remember she said some family members said they might not come if you marry a woman, she NEVER SAID SHE WOULDN'T BE THERE, because I am pretty sure she'll be there front row and center.\n\nTalk to your mom about her feelings and try to empathize with her, and in turn ask her to empathize with you. Tell her how her reaction made you feel. She can't read your mind and probably will need you to spell it out to her!\n\nBest of luck! Keep being your authentic self!", "I was impressed that she didn't deadname Amy to be honest, felt like that was coming any second with how the rest of the post went. But yeah OP, the problem here isn't Amy it's your family. You're asking Kevin to let you have your transphobic family there while not letting his non bigoted family attend. \n\nIf you're so concerned it will be an issue, here's a wild thought: disinvite the members of your family you are most concerned about being transphobic and let Kevin have his lovely family by his side on the day. \n\nNo? So why is it he's the only one who has to give up on family attending while you get to skip off into the night surrounded by bigoted family members?", "I think it's a little deeper than that.

I like you.", "She probably is currently at the stage when she's not cis female-passing yet. Hence, OP's (oh sorry, *her family's*) transphobia", "PREACH!!!", "Amy has transitioned long after puberty, so without expensive and extensive and intensive surgeries to feminise her features (brow bone, Adam\u2019s apple, jaw, chin) and classes with a vocal coach to raise the pitch of her voice Amy might come across as a handsome woman with strong features and a deep voice like Kathleen Turner *or* she might not pass as cisgender at all.\n\nSome trans people aren\u2019t interested in passing as cisgender either, so potentially Amy might not be interested in any gender confirmation treatment beyond hormones and just wants to declare herself a woman and wear feminine clothes, which is her right and isn\u2019t really impactful of OP\u2019s wedding plans.\n\nTransgender people aren\u2019t a monolith and blending in with the cisgender population isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s aim.", "\"Transition\" is largely a word to make cis people comfortable because it implies that you start at one end of a binary and then you transition and then the transition 'ends' when you are at the other side of the binary. The truth is there's a lot of stages in between, many trans people can't afford or can't medically transition for health reasons, many trans people will never 'pass' as cis, and many other trans people don't set 'passing' as cis as a goal. \n\nSo there's not like, a moment where you were 'a man' in all contexts and now you are 'a woman' in all contexts and that's it. There's a lot of stuff in between, and sometimes there's no clearcut point A or point B.", "That's the point; you *don't* know. You can't know. Even if someone doesn't look 'traditionally masculine' or 'traditionally feminine', you have no idea if they're cis, trans, intersex, gender non-conforming, or just plain old different looking.\n\nThis is why anti-trans nonsense hurts everyone, not just trans people. It polices conformity to highly specific standards and anyone even slightly 'off' gets punished.\n\nIt is worth noting that transition looks different for everyone, and it's a process that can take *years.* The more involved the transition, the longer it's going to take. Modern science is incredible, but it's not *that* incredible, lol. I'm assuming Amy is transitioning with HRT (hormone replacement therapy) which takes time to have a visible effect, and will have more of an effect the longer you're on it. It can take about a year for someone's voice to deepen if they're on testosterone, and that's a less involved process than re-arranging body fat.\n\nSo Amy might not look particularly 'traditionally' feminine after only a year. She might not *sound* particularly feminine either - that depends on if she's been doing voice training which, again, takes time and effort. And when it comes to bigots who aren't accepting of differences, they don't necessarily need to know she's trans in order to find that off-putting and jump to conclusions, correctly or otherwise.\n\nTLDR; differences scare bigots who are looking for an excuse and so everything becomes an excuse, medical transition is a process, and not all trans people pass as their gender. (If you have other questions I'm happy to answer them if I can)", "Transition is a process and may or may not involve hormones or medical changes. Regardless, some people \"pass\" as their gender ID and some don't so much. (And some cis women get abuse from the \"bathroom police\" because someone thinks they're too tall, too broad shouldered, too square jawed, etc etc., to be a cis woman.)", "Not everyone who transitions as an adult is able to \u201cpass\u201d visually. Or, maybe some of the family actually knows, and they are rude, gossipy people who would spend the wedding saying mean things. I would not invite people like that to my weddings, if I knew they were that way.", "It's a problem that comes from knowledge. If you see a girl using the girl's bathroom, you won't bat an eye, and so will the transfobes, but if they get to know that that girl used to be a boy, then suddenly it's a problem. That's why it's stupid to defend transphobe, because there's just no reason, other than to be rude towards those who realized their assigned gender at birth isn't what they identify as.\nSo with Amy, it is the same situation. We don't know if OPs family got to meet Amy before transitioning, but if they never did, there's no reason to hide Amy. If they did, then OP should be defending Amy, not \"protecting\" her family from Amy's existence.", "In this case I'm sure because the OP is blabbering to everyone about how unfair Kevin is being about not having things exactly her way all the time", "Exactly what you said. OP should be defending Amy.

Is the gender police going to grab everyone\u2019s crotch? Texas has completely lost its mind!", "Absolutely. OP needs to admit to herself she has been taught transphobia and she needs to put in the work to change. If she won't do that she should not marry her fianc\u00e9, honestly.", "It could be both, but in my opinion, if the issue was simply Amy being a best woman, there would be no reason for OP to mention that Amy is transgender. Also, OP replied to a comment saying she doesn't want Amy to even be a bridesmaid because \"it would be weird\" so it's got to be about Amy being transgender, not that Amy is a woman in the groom's party.", "100% agree", "That\u2019s super uber cool!!", "And her voice could still give her away sadly.", "There's no way to be \"obviously trans,\" especially if someone has undergone some or all of their chosen medical transition.

This is your time to stand up for your husband and HIS family. I would try and make sure Kevin understands that you are trying to protect Amy, but it is his decision, and you need to be okay with this. And also you really need to support Amy, especially if anything is coming up with your family about her.\n\nI think you should understand, regardless of Amy\u2019s transition, it was very hurtful to Kevin that you\u2019d be so unfeeling to his only family.
