I usually did this for family friends, but when I moved away for college I started looking at Facebook ads for babysitters. I reached out to mom who was looking for a sitter for her 7 year old son. I told her about my experience and offered to work for $13 an hour. This past week, I went to her place around 6pm to babysit her son for a few hours while she went out. She gave me some basic information about what to make him for dinner and his bedtime but didn\u2019t give me anything else. After she left it became apparent that her son was uncomfortable and refused to talk to me. I just thought he was shy at first so I just watched him from a distant while he played and everything seemed okay. About an hour in he became visibly upset and began to throw a tantrum. I tried to ask him what was wrong, but my attempts to communicate with him seemed to only make him more upset. After failing to try to calm him down, I tried to reach out to mom, who did not respond to any calls or messages. After about 30 minutes he seemed to calm down but was even more removed than before. When his mom returned home, I asked if he was prone to out burst and what might cause them in which she responded \u201coh, he has autism\u201d. I was not aware of this and when she asked me babysit again this week I told her that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with that, because I have no prior experience handing a child with autism and I didn\u2019t believe I had the necessary resources to do so. She seemed understanding, if not a bit disappointed, and I starting to wonder if I am in the wrong for saying no.

If you know you can not provide this child with the care they need then do not put yourself in the situation. You are making the right call for you and the child", "Absolutely NTA, but that mother is. She left her child with very specific sensory and social difficulty and needs in a situation that was traumatizing for him. I'm 99% sure you're not her first try at babysitters and she left out the autism part on purpose. Don't have any guilt on this.", "NTA - she set you up for failure by not disclosing her son's medical issues up front.  Add to that, the mom didn't answer the phone when you tried to call, which is a HUGE issue.", "NTA. You are free to accept or deny any babysitting job you want based on your comfort level. She is in the wrong for not telling you her child was autistic.", "NTAH she didn't give you the full extent of the information. She should have been 100% transparent with you as you were the one responsible for him for xx amount of time. If anything had happened to him, you wouldn't have known any of his history and all that is need for the relevant people involved.", "NTA but the mom is. She deliberately didn\u2019t tell you about her son\u2019s autism and set both you and him up for failure.", "Nta\n\nAside from her neglecting some pretty big info, she made herself completely unreachable if there was any kind of emergency. I wouldn't work with her again either.", "NTA, if you aren't comfortable being responsible for kids with special needs, there's nothing wrong in turning down an offer. Its like a mechanic refusing to work on an expensive sports car when he has no experience with it and might do more harm than good. Its just a job and you go with your comfort level based on experience.", "NTA. She didn't prepare you for that situation. If you feel bad you can reach out and tell her that you can consider it if she goes through his routines, habits and how to calm him down. And possibly a visit while mom is there so he can get used to you in a safe setting first.\n\nYou don't have to though. It is weird that she didn't say anything to prepare you.", "NTA but that mom sure is.", "Not only that, but upon learning he had had a tantrum, she should have given you a fat tip. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. This mom is negligent for pulling a bait n switch when her kid's health and safety was on the line. I guarantee she's had trouble finding babysitters in the past because of her son's autism and decided to just omit that information so you couldn't back out. Then she ignored your calls because she knew exactly what you were calling about and didn't want to deal with it. While I sympathize with her situation, that's still horrendous behavior on her part and I don't blame you one bit for not wanting to babysit for her ever again.\n\nI have a daughter with autism and I would never in a million years try to pull a fast one on a babysitter, esp. if it means my daughter could be in danger because that babysitter has no idea how to calm her or help her.", "NTA. Not everyone is equipped for that, and that's fine. She is the A H for not telling you in advance and not answering her phone when you tried getting a hold of her.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to babysit anyone you don\u2019t feel equipped to handle- and shouldn\u2019t. Mom absolutely should have disclosed this information to you and explained how her son functions- she left out vital information. If he had gotten hurt or broken something how would you have ever begun to handle that without knowing what things trigger his meltdowns or cause him stress?! Honestly, this sounds like you\u2019d dodged a bullet. Parents who aren\u2019t willing to fully equip sitters with the appropriate information are doing their kids a huge disservice.", "NTA.

She is TA for not letting you know everything you need to know about babysitting her child and making sure you can handle it. She was probably looking for some cheap easy babysitting. It could have easily been worse.", "NTA. She definitely intentionally left out that he\u2019s autistic.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t give you essential information that anyone would need to give good care. That\u2019s a big problem that has nothing to do with the kid\u2019s needs.

Not only because you're not comfortable caring for this kid, but because you tried to reach the mom and couldn't.

Its above your pay grade.", "NTA, if you are on a forum page for babysitters let the page admittaturs know what happened.  The biggest issue is that she refused to respond to your messages during the outburst.  This is child neglect. She did not make sure the sitter had the proper training and chose to ignore when there was an issue.", "YOU were set up by the mom.

You may have experience with babysitting normal children, but children with special needs are referred to as \"special needs\" because they, in fact, have special needs. Needs you weren't made aware of nor were you equipped to handle.\n\nGood on you for knowing your limits instead of trying to force your way through it and potentially risking the child.", "Yep and not answering phone was a big clue to that.
