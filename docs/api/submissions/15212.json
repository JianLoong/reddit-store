Shes so sweet and nice.\n\n\nLast weekend I was over at her moms house getting ready to go out and was looking at some pictures on her wall and I saw one of her younger brother and a man and took a double take. He looks exactly like my stepfather but younger. I tried to find another he was in but that was it. She saw me staring at it and said thats her father and I laughed and said he looks my stepdad. She asked me his name and I said it and the color of her face left. She started calling for her mom to come to the room and the next ten minutes was me awkwardly answering their questions.\n\n\nTurns out my stepdad is her father. I met him when I was six so my friend would have been eight and thats the time he left. He never mentioned having any kids so it was shocking. It was horrible to hear them cry and we never ended up going out. I told them that he has a successful business and maybe they could get money for back child support but they said they didn't want anything from him.\n\n\nI went home this week and things have just been awkward. My stepdad is so nice and literally my only father figure so to know he abandoned his biological kids is crazy. My stepdad kept asking me why Im acting weird and I didnt say anything at first. My mom pulled me aside and I told her everything. To my surprise she didnt react. She said how he lives his life is his business and I shouldnt judge him. This is coming from a former single mother\u2026 I remember her crying over my dad leaving us and I was disgusted by what she said so I told her loudly to not speak to me and shes a hypocrite and stormed out of the house.\n\n\nMy stepdad followed me to my car saying that I need to come back and apologize to my mom right now and I told him to go and apologize to the kids he abandoned and listed their names. He looked like he was going to faint and went back inside the house. My mom has been sending me texts that I need to apologize to my stepdad for being an asshole to him and \u201cmaking him cry for days\u201d and that he raised me and took care of me and that I shouldnt forget that.

He (and your mom) told you a massive lie of omission for your entire life. He (and your mom) walked away from innocent children he was legally and morally responsible for. The fact that he raised you and took care of you has very little bearing on this new information you\u2019ve discovered. It\u2019s ok to be appalled and take time to process this shock.

This almost sounds more like a movie plot than a real scenario.\n\nEDIT: I've thought about this more. I'm kind of thinking maybe your mom is the woman he left his wife for.

I don't think you have anything that you have to apologize for.", "NTA\n\nYour mother knew, by the way. \n\nThat's why she wasn't surprised, that's why she defended him and keeps defending him.

I'm sure more than a few days worth of tears were shed on their part.", "NTA- your mom and step-Dad out you in this spot by being dishonest. Not your fault.

The guy you saw as a father figure was suddenly human and reminded you of the dad that walked out on you.\n\nIts understandable you need time to process that.

Specifically ask on child support and custody issues. \n\nThat way with 2 sides of the story, you might have a clearer picture.", "NTA while I am all for men stepping into the step father role and taking it seriously, it\u2019s a huge difference knowing that he abandoned his kids to be your father. If I found out my dad had done that, I\u2019d be very upset so you have every right to your feelings.  There is no reason for you to apologize, you called him out on his shit which I feel like he deserves. He\u2019s crying over it now? That poor lady and her children have been crying for years. All of those decisions are on him and him alone.", "NTA and I am sure that was a horrible shock to both you and your friend. I hope you can continue getting to know each other. And I would tell your mom and stepdad they can go water the lawn with the crocodile tears. They are both just mad his secret is out the bag.", "NTA. I like the way you told your stepdad. Especially listing his kids names.", "NTA. Your stepdad is an AH for walking away from his family. He had his own children relying on him to be their dad and he abandoned them. \"If he didn't do what he did I would be the one without a dad and to be grateful\". This is the most pathetic excuse I've ever heard. That doesn't help at all, that makes it worse. I just hope none of this ruins your friendship with your co worker.", "Wow. This is some movie shit! A very sympathetic NTA.", "NTA, but I'd let your stepdad explain himself.  There may be another side to this story.  You have only heard what your friend told you and much of what she believes was probably told to her by her mother.  It may all be truthful, but chances are the truth is somewhere in the middle.  Your friend's mom may have made it very difficult for your stepdad to see his children or your stepdad may have had a substance abuse problem that he go over and is now a better person.  Not saying he's right, just saying that you should hear him out.", "So....NTA, but try and take a breath, and maybe approach your mom and step-dad and calmly ask for an explanation.\nIt is weird that it sounds like there is not  that much distance, same country and region, and they never went for child support or custody agreements.  Maybe write a letter explaining why you are hurt, so they can review and process.  It sounds like he is a great father to you, and while you could throw it away, maybe see if there is a middle ground you can reach.  People make mistakes.   He made one it sounds like, but do you really want to hate him forever because of it?", "NTA but how old are you? Are you able to financially support yourself? (I know you said you moved for a new job but the \u201csummer\u201d part of it makes it unclear to me if this is like an internship or summer camp or something more permanent). Listen, your stepdad\u2019s absolutely an SOB but life is complicated and principles don\u2019t pay the bills. Take time to think about how you really want to move forward (and what the possible consequences of that could be). Like is your bank account linked to your mom and stepdad in anyway? Do you have other family members you could talk to or stay with if needed? Also it might help to hear his side of the story. Unjustifiable as it may be, knowing could help you decide if you really want to go no contact or move it to low contact.\n\nAlso are the defenses coming solely from your mom or from both? If it\u2019s coming from just your mom, that could indicate remorse on your stepdad\u2019s side. She was pretty cold and self-serving from the start of your convo. If it\u2019s coming from both, that could indicate that he\u2019s really not remorseful and was just startled.\n\nI don\u2019t know, life is crazy and complicated and I fully agree that there\u2019s no statute of limitations on being an a-hole when you abandon your family like your stepdad did. But a remorseful a-hole is still better than a cold, defiant one.", "ESH\n\nLife is complicated. You have no idea what the set of circumstances was that led to his departure from that family. \n\nIt wasn't your place to offer up back child support, and it's pretty cold to turn your back on the only father figure you've ever known based on a 10 minute conversation with this other family.\n\nI understand how this news would definitely affect you emotionally -- and you're right to have a million questions -- but you are wrong for jumping to conclusions and judging your parents so harshly without at least sitting down and understanding their side of the story.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is entirely your mother and your stepdad\u2019s issue.", "It could be possible that the mom is a homewrecker and that\u2019s why he abandoned his actual family and that\u2019s why she said those things?", "ESH\n\nDad is TAH b/c it is hugely horrible to abandon his former wife (?) and children.  \n\nMom is TAH because she seems Ok with another woman struggling to raise your stepdad's children.  \n\nYou're not much better, either, being hateful to your mother and step dad who, whatever else he may be, has been good to you and loves you.\n\nThis is a complicated situation.  Your dad owes his other family a lot and should step up and make their lives better as he is able, absolutely right.  Your mom is in a tough spot, too; she loves him and she's already been abandoned once. She and your stepdad likely have a lot of guilt over their happiness together under the circumstances.  \n\nYour mom has a point, though: it's useless to judge your father.  Even killers have children they love and who love them in return despite their criminal activity.   \n\nThis situation is loaded with pain on all sides.  Do what you can to be a healing influence within your ability.  It's ok to love your father and hate what he did.  Encourage him take care of his former family as well as his current one.\n\nJudging helps nobody, even if it makes you feel better than your parents.  Try compassion and work to bring healing to the circumstances.", "Look up DARVO. It\u2019s kinda what she\u2019s doing. Going on the offensive to stay out of the defensive.", "Simply not true.  He did this to himself.  He has avoided thinking about what he did all these years.\n\nYou may have made him see his bad behaviour, but the behaviour is his to own.", "Right you're worse than the guy who abandoned his family, your mother is delusional.", "Your mom is desperately hoping she can blame this on you, get you to apologize, and then make everyone stop talking about this. She doesn\u2019t want to consider any of the alternatives because those are unbearable for her. She would have to confront her own poor decision-making and look more closely at both her and her husband\u2019s actions.", "You didn't abandon literal children. Your mom has some insane \"logic\" going on.", "That is so unbelievably false and manipulative. Your mom has been lying to herself for years so I\u2019m not optimistic she will come around. Please take care of yourself and your mental health! \u2764\ufe0f", "saying some brutal stuff is somehow worse than abandoning a whole family? yeah i hope you don\u2019t listen to your mom and know she\u2019s full of shit. that\u2019s one of the least rational comparisons i\u2019ve ever seen.", "No but it\u2019s okay to honor that feelings aren\u2019t logical and sometimes two very different things can be true. She can know and remember the things that were good and not engage or cultivate a relationship going forward. \n\nFwiw I have family I don\u2019t speak to. I\u2019m sad. I wish things were different but they\u2019re not. I can honor both the sadness from nostalgia of growing up and the anger and the boundaries I need to maintain as things are now.", "Hey, it's really traumatic realizing the blissful period of \"getting away with the awful shit I did\" is coming to an end.", "Omg, I didn\u2019t even connect those dots, holy fuck", "That was my thought. When I read how calm she was I was like.. oooh, not good.", "Oh she absolutely knew. \n\nShe just didn\u2019t care. She wanted a husband and a dad for her daughter at any cost.", "from the time line of it all it seriously seems like she was the affair partner and he left his family for her, so she\u2019s most likely satisfied. just horrible.", "Yes, urging people not to abandon their children tends to be good advice, and not the sort of thing one apologizes for saying.  All joking aside, wow.  You're completely in the right here.\n\nNote that your stepfather cried for days because he'd been found out, his true character revealed -- not out of remorse.\n\nThe idea that you should somehow be grateful that he abandoned his original family because that gave you a dad is just despicable.\n\nYou are very much, 200 % NTA", "It seems very likely that your mother knew, and that she possibly was the reason why he abandoned his family. \nHer asking you to apologize is totally absurd. You've got nothing to apologize for the empathy you feel for your friend and her family.\nYour mother saying you should be grateful that you are the one who got a father is disgusting. When couples split, responsible parents keep on being parents to the children of their former marriage. Instead, your stepfather literally ghosted them!\nI'm sorry, but this reality will forever change your perception of your parents", "NTA", "It sounds like she knew.", "NTA. The way you reacted seems like a natural reaction of a good person who had their world turned upside down. You did well so far, and going forward, I hope your relationship with your friend and their family doesn't take a downturn cause of this revelation. \n\nOne possible explanation for your mom's behaviour could be that she loves him and this new revelation makes her feel scared that she might lose him now to his past. And having already had someone walk out on her, she doesn't want a repeat, so she's telling herself that he doesn't need to make things right in his past, and what matters is the good family man he's been. The man she fell in love with. \n\nJust a possibility. And still inexcusable.", "This is one complicated mess. Esh im willing to bet this is either made up or fate had you meet your half sibling", "Opie, I am too shock to say anything snarky or striking. Oh dear", "I don't believe that's possible", "I agree but also the mother knew and kept it a secret \n\nInfo needed: did Op ever meet any of OP step father\u2019s family. IF SO they were All Part of the cover up", "But you didn't tell him anything he didn't know except that you knew and you judged him for his assholedom...", "Ask your mother what about confronting a coward puts you on the same level as familial abandonment? Ask her to explain why telling him to take care of his child puts you on the same level as a man who's family had no idea what happened to him.", "YOU just found out. Tone policing is a deflection tactic to turn the focus from the actual offense to THEIR reaction to being called out, \"why are you so mean to me/him?\"", "Making someone feel bad because they did something bad is not a greater sin than the original bad thing. My god.", "You care about his bio kids' feelings. Someone has to. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\n\nAsk your Mum if she was the AP...", "For heaven's sake, your stepfather was upset because you found out what a lousy immoral person he is. And your mother is upset because you discovered she's a conniving AH.\nGood, they can live with it", "No. You clearly are the only one thinking about other people's feelings here.", "Ask your mom did she encourage him to leave his family for her. Do ot face to face and see what her reaction is. On the anything wrong to you - you angry on behalf of his abandoned family. NTA.", "She very obviously knew", "This a classic hallmark film with a very  UNHAPPY ending for your parents \ud83d\ude15.   \n\nAlso NTA", "That\u2019s what I thought! OP met him around the time he left his family, so it seems likely\u2026", "There's no way OPs mom wasn't aware. Which is sadder really."]}
