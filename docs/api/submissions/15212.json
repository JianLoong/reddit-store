I moved an hour away and started a job over the summer and have become close with a few coworkers. One of them and I have become actual friends outside of the office and she\u2019s integrated me into her friend circle. After getting to know her backstory (mom was abandoned while pregnant and had to raise three kids) we got close and I consider her a good friend now. Shes so sweet and nice.\n\n\nLast weekend I was over at her moms house getting ready to go out and was looking at some pictures on her wall and I saw one of her younger brother and a man and took a double take. He looks exactly like my stepfather but younger. I tried to find another he was in but that was it. She saw me staring at it and said thats her father and I laughed and said he looks my stepdad. She asked me his name and I said it and the color of her face left. She started calling for her mom to come to the room and the next ten minutes was me awkwardly answering their questions.\n\n\nTurns out my stepdad is her father. I met him when I was six so my friend would have been eight and thats the time he left. He never mentioned having any kids so it was shocking. It was horrible to hear them cry and we never ended up going out. I told them that he has a successful business and maybe they could get money for back child support but they said they didn't want anything from him.\n\n\nI went home this week and things have just been awkward. My stepdad is so nice and literally my only father figure so to know he abandoned his biological kids is crazy. My stepdad kept asking me why Im acting weird and I didnt say anything at first. My mom pulled me aside and I told her everything. To my surprise she didnt react. She said how he lives his life is his business and I shouldnt judge him. This is coming from a former single mother\u2026 I remember her crying over my dad leaving us and I was disgusted by what she said so I told her loudly to not speak to me and shes a hypocrite and stormed out of the house.\n\n\nMy stepdad followed me to my car saying that I need to come back and apologize to my mom right now and I told him to go and apologize to the kids he abandoned and listed their names. He looked like he was going to faint and went back inside the house. My mom has been sending me texts that I need to apologize to my stepdad for being an asshole to him and \u201cmaking him cry for days\u201d and that he raised me and took care of me and that I shouldnt forget that. And that if he didnt do what he did I would be the one without a dad and to be grateful. I havent replied back.

Let's just say that if you ever find yourself on a life-boat with limited food and water, make sure to sit outside pushing distance.  NTA.", "NTA.  Your mom should be apologizing to you for reacting to the news of your dad's misbehavior by attacking you instead.", "You\u2019ve discovered that your stepfather is not who you thought he was. He (and your mom) told you a massive lie of omission for your entire life. He (and your mom) walked away from innocent children he was legally and morally responsible for. The fact that he raised you and took care of you has very little bearing on this new information you\u2019ve discovered. It\u2019s ok to be appalled and take time to process this shock. And for gods sake, you don\u2019t need to be the one apologizing. NTA.", "NTA!!   He is a MAJOR ASSHOLE.    He has a lot of nerve asking for an apology when your feelings are completely valid and he has decimated those 4 other people.\n\nYou are NOT the Asshole.   You didn't make him cry for days - his own assholishness and hopefully shame for what he did is what is making him cry.", "NTA  \nYour stepdad needs to own up to what he did, abandoning a family like that.  \nJust because he was a good father figure for you doesn't justify what he did.  \nYour mother too is being a hypocrite and shouldn't expect you to apologize.", "NTA\n\nThis is what happens when the skeletons in your closet come back to haunt you. This almost sounds more like a movie plot than a real scenario.\n\nEDIT: I've thought about this more. I'm kind of thinking maybe your mom is the woman he left his wife for. Meaning your mom has also known and assumed you'd never find out. So in some ways...she's worried about how she looks in your eyes also. Which is why it's so important to keep the blame on you (or at least try to).", "NTA. No way. \n\nHe fled his responsibilities to his children and his ex wife. Sounds like you are the first person to call him out on abandoning his kids. You have nothing to apologize for. Your mother is selfishly taking his side even though she was on the receiving end of the same actions by your father (from what it seems) \n\nI do think you should have a sit down with him and your mom and have him tell you the truth of his life and why he made the decisions he made. You deserve to hear the truth from him and more importantly he needs to hear your truth and your thoughts on what this means to you \n\nGood luck OP", "NTA. That's wild and one of the most hypocritical situations I've ever heard of in my life. Your mom and stepdad are acting awful about the whole thing.", "Provided this is true, NTA.\n\nHoly crap, your step dad abandoned his bio-kids, just to raise you? That's all sorts of messed up.", "NTA. I almost said go back to hear his side to the story, but then realized he not only walked out, but never paid child support for your friend and her siblings. based on your statement Correct?\n\nThere is no excuse if he skipped out on child support. He's the AH and so is your mother for the delusional you should be grateful comment. I usually try to be positive, but there is nothing ok with walking out on your kids.", "NTA, holy cow didn't fate just take a cosmic baseball bat to his glass house.", "NTA. Both your parents are AHs though. Big ones.", "NTA.", "NTA.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry you're going through this.\n\nYou don't owe anyone an apology.", "NTA and what he did sounds really shitty", "NTA. \n\n>I met him when I was six so my friend would have been eight and thats the time he left.\n\nYou do realise that your mother probably (knowingly) was his AP,  like some others already mentioned? She and your stepdad really suck, your mother maybe the most, because she knew what it was like to be an abandoned, single mother. But she probably couldn't care less, as long as she and her children were taken care of.", "That's NC worthy. NTA", "NTA. \n\nYou have integrity and you should be proud of yourself.\n\nIt's nice he was kind to you and a father figure, but he was totally an A.H for abandoning his biological children. He could have been a good stepdad and a good dad, but he chose not to. I don't think you have anything that you have to apologize for.", "NTA\n\nYour mother knew, by the way. \n\nThat's why she wasn't surprised, that's why she defended him and keeps defending him. He probably told her the truth before asking her to marry him, together with some bullshit story that made her accept him for who he was. \n\nGood for you for taking a stand and telling both your mom and stepdad how hypocrite they are.", "NTA\n\nYour moms reaction indicating that she always knew this man abandoned his children. She didn\u2019t care because he chose y\u2019all over his other family! Yikes", "NTA - \n\nLet get petty on this one - tell your mom you want to apologize in person, when you arrive have your friend/step-sister with you.", "NTA. Even if he had his reasons, and/or he is regretful of it, that's a shitty thing to do. And you have every single reason to be mad at him for it.", "The cynical part of me wonders if the mother of his other kids was abusive, or an addict, or did something else to harm him.\n\nThe logical part of me thinks it\u2019s unlikely because of the sheer amount of men who abandon their children, so I\u2019m going to say NTA\n\nMight be appropriate to ask for an explanation before going full nuclear though", "NTA  and your mom needs to realize he isn't crying cause you made him feel bad, he's crying because he knows you're right", "NTA Your stepdad is. He owes everybody an apology (a huge one).", "NTA.  Some people are just gross. I'm sorry for your loss. I mean the respect you used to have for your mother and stepfather.\n\nHow did he get out of paying child support? Did he change his name? Is everything about him a lie?", "NTA.\n\nOp i hate to say it but your mom was likely the other woman and your SD left his family for her. \n\nBut back on topic no you aren't TA for telling him about himself. Oh he cried for days? Boo freaking hoo. He walked away from his kids and wife. I'm sure more than a few days worth of tears were shed on their part.", "NTA- your mom and step-Dad out you in this spot by being dishonest. Not your fault. Your reaction is fairly normal.  \n\nMaybe there is some extenuating circumstances... but I doubt it", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA\nYou learned something that shook your whole foundation.  The guy you saw as a father figure was suddenly human and reminded you of the dad that walked out on you.\n\nIts understandable you need time to process that. Remember your new friend may only know what her mom said.\n\nText your step-dad. Ask his side of things. Specifically ask on child support and custody issues. \n\nThat way with 2 sides of the story, you might have a clearer picture.", "NTA while I am all for men stepping into the step father role and taking it seriously, it\u2019s a huge difference knowing that he abandoned his kids to be your father. If I found out my dad had done that, I\u2019d be very upset so you have every right to your feelings.  There is no reason for you to apologize, you called him out on his shit which I feel like he deserves. He\u2019s crying over it now? That poor lady and her children have been crying for years. All of those decisions are on him and him alone.", "NTA and I am sure that was a horrible shock to both you and your friend. I hope you can continue getting to know each other. And I would tell your mom and stepdad they can go water the lawn with the crocodile tears. They are both just mad his secret is out the bag.", "NTA. I like the way you told your stepdad. Especially listing his kids names.", "NTA. Your stepdad is an AH for walking away from his family. He had his own children relying on him to be their dad and he abandoned them. \"If he didn't do what he did I would be the one without a dad and to be grateful\". This is the most pathetic excuse I've ever heard. That doesn't help at all, that makes it worse. I just hope none of this ruins your friendship with your co worker.", "Wow. This is some movie shit! A very sympathetic NTA.", "NTA, but I'd let your stepdad explain himself.  There may be another side to this story.  You have only heard what your friend told you and much of what she believes was probably told to her by her mother.  It may all be truthful, but chances are the truth is somewhere in the middle.  Your friend's mom may have made it very difficult for your stepdad to see his children or your stepdad may have had a substance abuse problem that he go over and is now a better person.  Not saying he's right, just saying that you should hear him out.", "So....NTA, but try and take a breath, and maybe approach your mom and step-dad and calmly ask for an explanation.\nIt is weird that it sounds like there is not  that much distance, same country and region, and they never went for child support or custody agreements.  Maybe write a letter explaining why you are hurt, so they can review and process.  It sounds like he is a great father to you, and while you could throw it away, maybe see if there is a middle ground you can reach.  People make mistakes.   He made one it sounds like, but do you really want to hate him forever because of it?", "NTA but how old are you? Are you able to financially support yourself? (I know you said you moved for a new job but the \u201csummer\u201d part of it makes it unclear to me if this is like an internship or summer camp or something more permanent). Listen, your stepdad\u2019s absolutely an SOB but life is complicated and principles don\u2019t pay the bills. Take time to think about how you really want to move forward (and what the possible consequences of that could be). Like is your bank account linked to your mom and stepdad in anyway? Do you have other family members you could talk to or stay with if needed? Also it might help to hear his side of the story. Unjustifiable as it may be, knowing could help you decide if you really want to go no contact or move it to low contact.\n\nAlso are the defenses coming solely from your mom or from both? If it\u2019s coming from just your mom, that could indicate remorse on your stepdad\u2019s side. She was pretty cold and self-serving from the start of your convo. If it\u2019s coming from both, that could indicate that he\u2019s really not remorseful and was just startled.\n\nI don\u2019t know, life is crazy and complicated and I fully agree that there\u2019s no statute of limitations on being an a-hole when you abandon your family like your stepdad did. But a remorseful a-hole is still better than a cold, defiant one.", "ESH\n\nLife is complicated. You have no idea what the set of circumstances was that led to his departure from that family. \n\nIt wasn't your place to offer up back child support, and it's pretty cold to turn your back on the only father figure you've ever known based on a 10 minute conversation with this other family.\n\nI understand how this news would definitely affect you emotionally -- and you're right to have a million questions -- but you are wrong for jumping to conclusions and judging your parents so harshly without at least sitting down and understanding their side of the story.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
