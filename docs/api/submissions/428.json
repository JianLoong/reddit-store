It's a leased car, otherwise I doubt he'd care about such minor surface damage. Think I can get the paint off myself, but I'm at a loss with the cracks and the nick. I'm terrified that it'll be an added cost on the lease when we turn it in in a couple years. It was my fault, my dad was trying to help me pull in but I should have ejected and backed out again as soon as the mirror hit the garage door. I'm embarrassed that it'll be a few hundred to fix and I don't currently have a job.

It sounds like you made an honest mistake, and I don\u2019t know why you would want to hide this from your husband. From the info you gave concealing something like this would be a bigger deal than the damage itself.", "YWBTA just because of the cost. If you wee paying for it alone, that would be different, but you're trying to sneak it by him even though he will be paying for it. Surely that dollar amount warrants a conversation.", "YTA. If his name is on the lease too, he\u2019s liable too.", "Are you scared of your husband is why you won't tell him? If so there's way bigger issues at hand. Yeah a bit embarrassing but accidents happen and it's a fairly minor issue. A bigger issue would be hiding it and lying about finances. YWBTA", "You should take another look at the contract first; you might have some leeway when it comes minor damage like that. But yes, YWBTA if you don't tell your husband.", "YWBTA - Why wouldn't you tell your partner?", "YTA. How old are you?", "Tell your husband. Depending on the amount of the repairs, it may be better to file on your comprehensive coverage on the car. This is what insurance is for. Tell your husband, get a quote on the repairs and make an informed decision on next steps.  I know that you feel bad because you are unemployed, but it was an accident. Don't compound it by lying to your husband.  When life is rough you cling to each other. Not hiding and secrets.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This worries me.", "YTA if you purposefully hide spending from your spouse.", "YWBTA. This kind of secret really isn't necessary to keep. It's embarrassing. But you did it. So suck it up, feel embarrassed, be honest, and get the car fixed. If it's his money that you're using to pay for the car repair, It would be extra fucked up to lie to him about it or keep that secret.", "if you are scared to tell your husband about a car accident you have bigger problems than the paint being scratched", "YTA. Lying always makes you the asshole.", "Is this how you want your relationship with your husband to be like going forward? Can he lie to you too , make no mistake\u2026. What you\u2019re thinking about doing is lying", "I suppose that's true, it's easier to explain needing money than concealing spending money if I got caught.", "That's fair, we have separate bank accounts still but most of what's in mine now is an allowance from him - so it is still his money.", "No, I'm not really scared of my husband. I'm just really sensitive and disappointing him would get me far more upset than he would.", "That's a good suggestion, I don't know what the dealership considers normal wear and tear. We might already be screwed anyways because we had to get a tire patched.", "Because it's embarrassing that it happened for such a stupid reason.", "I'm more scared of my reaction when he finds out, not his. I have terrible anxiety, I've had full blown panic attacks over small mistakes before.", "Yeah and I'm going to be honest, this should be obvious to you. Like this should have been a no-brainer.", "No, it\u2019s YOUR money if it\u2019s your allowance. Normal wear and tear on a leased car is expected, things happen. Contact the dealership and ask what the terms are in case of damage. NTA. I hope you\u2019re not really afraid of your husband though. I\u2019ve had to tell mine a time or two I smashed up a bumper or a car door, he was understanding as a husband should be.", "This concerns me a lot. If you are a SAHM, you provide lots of care that frees him up to advance his career. You are supporting him just as much as as he's supporting you. His income is equally yours, & calling your spending money an allowance implies an unhealthy power dynamic. If you didn't have an unhealthy power dynamic about money, you wouldn't be here, asking if it was ok to hide your spending from him. \n\nLet me ask this - if he dinged the car, would he simply take it to get repaired without consulting you? Does he have the liberty to freely spend, while you have to account for every dollar? What's good for the goose is good for the gander. Double standards are extremely unhealthy.", "Well that's good at least. My guess is he'd be way more disappointed if you lied to him and hid it and he found out. It was a mistake. Better to just own it and get it fixed then move on than adding a trust issue to the mix", "Read your contract carefully! I know my contract covers small dings and such. Getting a tire patched definitely counts as normal wear and tear. That small nick is probably fine too (although again, I'd check your state's definition of normal wear and tear just to be sure). That inch-long crack is the only thing that might become an added cost, but here's the thing-- even if it comes down to that, it probably won't cost you a lot to fix. Financially, it makes more sense to wait until then instead of fixing it now, because there's a good chance that you won't be held liable for it.", "Hiding the truth from your partner is embarrassing, a little scratch on your car isn't. I would buff out the paint and only fix the scratch before returning the vehicle at the end of the lease, if you fix all the little dings at the same time it will be overall cheaper"]}
