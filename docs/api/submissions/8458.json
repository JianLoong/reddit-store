The thing is she never fully finishes her food, like there's always pieces of pasta left in the bowl when she puts it in the sink. She does this with all of her food, like there's always bits of noodles or rice left  on her plate. \n\nI've told her repeatedly to just finish her food because its a waste otherwise, even if its \"only a tiny bit left\" on the plate. I still don't understand why she just doesn't finish it. I've told her that if she continues doing that I won't get those pasta packets anymore. She just rolled her eyes. \nI've noticed that she's still leaving bits food left in her plates/bowls so I don't get those pasta packets anymore. \n\nJust wondering if I'm in the wrong here. I've got a history of binging/complicated relationship with food so I don't know if I'm being over sensitive as a result. Just seeing any type of food waste upsets me.\n\nEdit: just to clarify, I've never forced my sister (or anyone) to finish eating. It's more along the lines of, \"hey, you've still got a bit left in your bowl. Don't put in the sink, just leave it for later when you're hungry or ask mum if she wants it.\" And to be fair, anytime I tell her that she just rolls her eyes and leaves the plate anyway. There's only a 3 year age difference between us so she doesn't really listen to me anyway. So I think the comments on me micromanaging her are a bit ludicrous. \nI've never said \"finish your plate right now\" or told her that she has to finish it immediately. I completely understand stopping when you're full and I never want to encourage bad eating habits for anyone.\n\nI guess I'm also worried about cost because in the UK, food prices are increasing bit by bit each week and all the ready made meals/process food cost more in general so I see it not only as a waste food but money as well, especially because we're a really low income household. \n\nI think some of the comments are needlessly cruel, especially ones commenting on my own eating issues. And I do think people and society in general have gotten used to food waste and throwing out food, rather than just leaving it for later or for leftovers. Even if it's only a bite or two, wouldn't it better to have that bite later whenever you're not full rather than just throwing it out immediately?", "created_utc": 1674853179, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mvw5q/aita_for_not_buying_my_sisters_ready_made_meals/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She does it too all the time even now actually after she's all grown up. \n\nThe thing that helped without trying to be the \"dad\" in this situation, is I still made her food but gave her slightly smaller portion than before. This in turn made her finish everything clean AND if she wanted more, she could help herself for a second plate.\n\nThe reason why I said she still does that now is because I don't serve her dinner or food anymore because we're all grown now she can feed herself.", "YTA If she's full, she's full.

At least, it doesn\u2019t matter compared to the negative effect you could have on your sister if you keep doing that. I grew up with parents who would make me finish my plate, even if I wasn\u2019t hungry anymore. I now have a permanently messed up relationship with food.

Saves a lifetime of fucked up eating habits. \n\nIt\u2019s totally fair to not want her putting bits of leftover food in the dishwater, but the solution is to have her scrape her plate into the trash or the garbage disposal (EDIT or maybe the compost if it\u2019s compatible and you\u2019re really concerned about waste) not to force her to continue to eat when she\u2019s full.

If she was leaving a lot of it leftover, you would be justified in providing her with reheating containers and asking her to try finishing it later - but with only bits, that isn't relevant.    \n\n\nWould it help you avoid this trigger if you asked her to scrape her own dishes?  Be honest with her about why - \"Because I have this irrational issue with food waste, and I don't want to pass it on to you\".  Unless she is also disabled, it would be appropriate for a 16yo to take responsibility for clearing up after her own meals.  Did you do that when you were 16?", "Why are you the maid to your family?

If she doesn't want to eat, you can't make her.

Work with her to find ways to reuse the leftovers in other recipes (ex: broccoli cheese soup).\n\nShe's also 16. It's normal to display some rebellious gestures as she learns to test her own independence. Take her to the grocery store with you so she knows how to shop and compare prices.

A spoonful of food is not food waste, it\u2019s you projecting your personal issues with food onto your sister. And then your solution to the problem is to stop buying food she eats?

There's no need whatsoever to be this overbearing.", "YTA for this specific thing -  although I want to say, given that you're only 19 and caring for your disabled mother and your sister, I do not think you are TA in general. \n\nIt is not good to force people to finish food once they're sated/full. \"You must finish every last crumb on your plate or else it is an ethical failing\" is not a good approach. It can encourage bad eating habits and disordered eating. If she's eating and is healthy, then there's not much wrong with what she's doing. \n\nI'm guessing your brain and emotions have latched onto this because a lot of your life is very stressful and busy with taking care of everyone else. If you can, I encourage you to try to get additional help (does your mother qualify for a caregiver through Medicaid or her insurance or anything)? Good luck!", "YTA- a bite or two of food makes very little difference. People should eat until they feel full.", "You're in the wrong, definitely.

It\u2019s a little too much to eat in one sitting, but what\u2019s left over when you\u2019re full isn\u2019t enough to save for later.

S. here but you suck FAR MORE.\n\n\nYou\u2019re an asshole because you\u2019re pushing her to save SPOONFULS? I would literally never touch that again. It would still get wasted, just when its disgusting from sitting for forever?? You ACKNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE  A HISTORY OF BINGING BUT CANT SEE HOW PUSHING HER TO FINISH HER FOOD MAKES YOU AN AH? Holy shit.\n\nYour sister sucks a little because she doesn\u2019t put her leftovers in the garbage or garbage disposal?? That\u2019s rude if she isn\u2019t the one doing the dishes.", "OP said the problem is putting leftover food into the dishwater instead of saving it for later of offering it to other people.

It's scientifically shown that Clean Plate clubs leads to eating disorders.", "I agree with this. I have a feeling the real issue isnt the food waste but actually the cleaning up. If shes 16 she should be fully capable of disposing of anything left over and washing her own dishes. Expecting her sister to be her mother is as damning to her mental health as anything else in this post. If the concern is literally JUST about food waste then sure, maybe that would be a bit overboard. \n\nAs someone who has been hospitalized for an eating disorder all these comments about \"forcing her to finish\" just are not it at all. Clearly not many people know how they develop or present, but thats typical for most communities.

Not a reasonable amount to save or offer to others as a real portion of their meal. And not an amount that is likely to age well if stored.\n\nAlso the dishwasher issue is new to me. it was never mentioned in the original post or in early replies from OP, which makes it seem like they are reaching for an excuse that seems more reasonable now that people are voting they are TA.\n\nThe amount of food leftover also mean there is very, very little food wasted or money wasted here. There is likely more or equal waste in the bottom of a pan that can't be fully scraped out.", "In OP\u2019s edit they clarified that they get upset about a single bite of food getting thrown away which is frankly ridiculous", "You want her to save a single spoonful of leftovers?

I\u2019m sorry you feel that to be harsh, but it is the truth and what you are doing to your sister is dangerous and unhealthy.\n\nEdit: My dad has actually been doing this for years, and let me tell you how it has gone in terms of reducing food waste: He has three separate freezers FULL of little bits of food that are years old. A couple years ago I found the butt end of a baguette from 2012. In 2019. It's obsessive hoarder behavior (it's an extension of his own issues with food), it is neither practical nor reasonable, and it is functionally the same as throwing it in the trash.", "you need to rethink what you just told her.

Lil sis hasn't been forced to eat anything she didn't want to because she stood her ground, big sis can use other options to prevent food waste.\n\nLet's not forget the human element here: They are a pair of parentified teenagers who's mother is disabled so they have to fend for themselves.
