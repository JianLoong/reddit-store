It's understandable that you agreed to let your neighbors install the security camera on your property assuming it would be discrete. However, the camera's incorrect positioning and the sudden activation of giant flood lights sound like a major intrusion to your property. It's completely reasonable to ask your neighbor to move the camera back to their property.", "NTA. You expected something small and discreet and instead you got a huge eye sore AND a flood light. Besides, the white truck mystery was resolved, so the camera now is entirely surplus to requirements.", "NTA.  OP is perfectly reasonable in not want obtrusive surveillance gear on their property when it isn't something they themselves want.  Neighbors sound like they are being super paranoid and have a bit too much time on their hands to obsess over it.  They are the folks that used to secretly stare out their windows at EVERYTHING in the neighborhood, updated for the modern nothing is private age.", "NTA, Blinding lights and an obtrusive camera are *not* what you thought you were agreeing to when you nicely allowed the paranoid neighbors to have a surveillance camera installed on *your* property.\n\nTell the neighbors you are sorry, but this isn\u2019t working for you. This isn\u2019t what you agreed to, why would you agree to blinding lights? This is ridiculous. They will have to figure out some other place to put their surveillance apparatus, it maybe not as optimal, but it can\u2019t be on your property anymore. \n\nTell them that if the thing isn\u2019t properly removed in a timely fashion, (for example a month), it *will* be removed, and disposed of. \n\nNTA Damn, you give people an inch, and they take a mile.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You agreed to a small, discrete camera, but the company installed a noticeable eyesore.", "NTA, you're not required to have anything on your property of theirs. and as their issue was resolved i don't see why they would need the camera on your property anyways.", "NTA, I\u2019d just take it down myself and leave it on their porch to do what they want with. There\u2019s one thing agreeing to something discreet, but this sounds far from it", "There's no conflict here. You told him to move it and he said okay.", "NTA. Things went out of bounds and security cameras are not only for protection but also personal use by those who own them. Plus, the novelty of having shared connectivity would have worn off quick.

It\u2019s not worth the potential headache\u2026", "NTA\n\nYou need to be a bit stronger in your wording. He seems to be the type that if you give him an inch he\u2019ll take a mile. Since he\u2019s agreed in writing, ask when it will happen and demand (not ask) that the lights be turned off until it is moved. If he doesn\u2019t give a reasonable timeframe for when it will be moved, inform him that you will be disconnecting it and dismounting it after X days. \n\nSounds to me like he wants to be a neighborhood busybody but wants you to take the fall for it.", "NTA.
