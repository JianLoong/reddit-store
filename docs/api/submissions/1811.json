Either way, it should be understood that when it comes to dating a friend\u2019s sibling, respect your friend and talk to them. Romantic relationships crash and burn at a higher rate than friendships. Sometimes friends  establish rules like this because they know their siblings are toxic players.  Sometimes they do it because they are just spoiled brats who try to control their friends.  Either way, respecting your friend means respecting your friend\u2019s boundaries.\n\nElena\u2014Pure AH.

Her birthday party, her house, her rules. \n\nI have a friend who explicitly told us all (me and 3 other friends) not to mess with her brother, and he\u2019s drop dead handsome. When we asked why, she said that her brother gets bored very quickly in a relationship and he once broke up with one of her friend. It was very messy to the point that her friend keep calling her, begging her to talk to her brother, to bring them back together. Said friend showed up at their parents house, pretending to visit her but once she spotted her brother she started screaming at him for breaking up with her. Her parents kicked her out after she called him all kinds of names under the sun. She doesn\u2019t want to be  in the middle again or lose another friend. She begged her brother not to mess with her friends but he kept ignoring it. He said that if they were true friends, they would respect her boundaries, because his friends respect his boundaries to keep their hands off her. Her friendship was more important to us, we didn't even flirt with him.\n\nMany years later the moved to another country and he started messing with her new friends\ud83d\ude44", "What are you all? 16? 17?  If you\u2019re all adults it\u2019s no one\u2019s business who\u2019s sleeping with who if everyone is single. Why does the sister think she gets to police who her brother sleeps with? Does he have a pattern of sleeping with her friends and causing problems? Just way to many unanswered questions here.", "Nta. Chloe did this to herself", "Eh - brother sounds like a jerk. All her friend had to do was NOT have sex w/ one guy and she got a free place to stay in France. It really isn't that difficult. There were other guys there and last I heard, there are guys in France who are willing to have sex with 20-something American tourists.\n\nLots of people have a \"don't sleep w/ my family member\" rule for their friend group to avoid drama in their lives. It sounds like the brother is ALL drama ALL the time. I wouldn't want the whole vacation spent w/ one friend trying to figure out if my brother REALLY likes her while brother is flirting w/ another friend on the Terrace. Who needs that?\n\nMy sister had this rule for her friends w/ my brother b/c as much as she loved my brother, he was a terrible boyfriend and liked to sleep around. My brother was much older than me, but when I got in my 20's and noticed all his GF's were my age or younger, I warned my friends about him. They all had better taste in men than my sister's friends, so no rule was needed.", "How is it ESH? You\u2019re telling me you get a free vacation, and you can\u2019t follow a simple rule in a country filled with strangers you can smash? That\u2019s on you. You knew what would happen if you broke the rule. Seems like it Chloe fucked around and found out", "For real, is this man's dick made of HEROIN? How is he so irresistible?", "The irresistibility of forbidden fruit! Lol", "But Chloe wasnt the one bothering her, it was the brother. OP tattling literally did nothing to the brother, and everything to her friend. Massive YTA for that alone.", "It seems like a boundary most people would have. This is my family member. If you'd like to be my friend, please don't sleep with them. Doesn't have to be your boundary, but it's understandable.", "Lol, was also thinking this. Is it some kind of \"cruel intentions\" movie plot going on?", "You can't force your siblings and friends not to hook up, but you absolutely can choose not to have friendships with those people. It's not an unreasonable boundary to have with your friends. \"Please don't sleep with my family members.\"", "> But then again, she should have made it a girl\u2019s trip if that was the case.\n\nParents paid, its family their property, so very good chance him being there wasn't her decision.", "She probably was not allowed to exclude him since it's their parents property.... And yeah, OP replies that the brother does scramble to F all his sisters' friends and when OP walked in on him and Chloe **they were in the middle of the kitchen**.... So yeah, brother does it on purpose to show his dominance or whatever so any of the friends who fall for it definitely deserve to be out on their ass. The real AH's seem to be the parents who let the brother shove his way into anything Elena does.... NTA", "Eh, host had 1 rule. What if it's her golden child 18 year old baby brother and she just didn't want to deal with that  on her vacation birthday? It's pretty common for friends to have the 'don't f my sibling' rule. Especially for just quick bangs. Like, guys and thier sisters? But either way\n\nParents could have insisted brother  tag along since they were being so gracious and the brother certainly isn't acting older than his 22 year old sister. He didn't want the  secret kept, he goaded op. \n\nThe only thing op did was be honest when asked what's wrong....?", "Yes, brother sounds like the problem here.  Bet she couldn't exclude him because they stayed in their parents' house.   Bet he saw this as the perfect opportunity to get with as many of her friends as he could manipulate.", "It's ESH because only the woman faces consequences for a situation involving 2 consenting adults.  And it's super weird to try to police who your friend or brother can sleep with they're adults and their sex lives are none of her business. They're AH for ignoring her boundaries but she's an AH for making that a boundary to begin with.", "Fair.", "She can\u2019t kick her brother out of his own home. And Chloe knew her friends boundaries. Besides it\u2019s just wrong to get with your friends siblings when you know they don\u2019t want you to. Chloe risked her friendship for a guy. She basically told Elena that Elena\u2019s bro was more important than Elena. Elena has a right to act accordingly.", "B/c the brother is a jerk, the sister knew it and didn't want the drama. There is noting the sister could do to the brother if he slept w/ her friends, but she could ask her friends not to sleep w/ her brother.\n\nIt isn't a big ask either. Most people know not to sleep w/ their friends siblings w/o discusing w/ the friend b/c they know it causes drama.", "Which is why he's enjoying giving OP shit over it, he is most likely loving making her feel guilty over it and has no guilt himself. Yet another walking stain to my gender.. smh.", "Chloe didn't keep the agreement. When your friend hosting says no funny business with my brother and the moment she did this she wasn't a friend anymore and so no need to keep a secret. NTA this kind of people like Chloe hurt others on purpose \ud83e\udd2e", "I don't think it is if everyone is an adult. If my brother wanted to date one of my friends the only objections that I think would be fair would be if there was a reason to oppose it. Like a history or cheating or some kind of bad behavior.\n\nI don't know the reason why OP's friend has this rule and why the brother apparently has no agency.", "LMAO but what if they're genuinely happy in the end they should still be unhappy because she doesn't like it? They're adults (I use that term loosely here) and it's their lives. She sounds extremely selfish but to each their own\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Good way to lose your friends and family.", "I agree it\u2019s weird, but can you have a boundary around someone else\u2019s behaviour that doesn\u2019t affect you?\n\nI think it\u2019s just plain old controlling rather than giving it any legitimacy as a boundary.", "As far as I'm concerned if you have to tell your friends not to fuck your 14-year-old brother they probably shouldn't be your friends", "Wasn't this a plot of an episode of Emily in Paris?", "Again, you knew the consequences, you said \u201cshe would never\u201d. And she did. I\u2019m not gonna feel bad for someone who has one rule and breaks it", "It\u2019s NTA the brother was goading OP on", "The need to spell out \"don't sleep with my brother\" leads me to suspect that Elena may have already known that her brother and Chloe were hooking up, and doesn't want it to keep happening.", "He does it because you let him get under your skin and that amuses him.", "Chloe isn't innocent. She knew the rules. She could resist the brother. She chose not to.\n\nShe knew nothing would happen to the brother and she would be kicked out.  She chose to sleep w/ him anyway.", "Do you think shes dead?", "Chloe is an adult and she can fuck whoever she wants. What, should she now have to wear a red A on her chest now?", "That\u2019s what I was thinking. Worst most horrible strategy ever, but it explains his obsession with getting under OPs skin. But I might read to many enemy to lover books", "That's nice that it isn't your boundry, but it isn't an uncommon one. Also, we aren't taking about dating. We are talking about a guy who love to sleep w/ his sister's friends so he can rub her face in it.", "I'm definitely not saying the brother should be blameless, and you're definitely within reason to be okay with it. I get why some people wouldn't be though. IDK how I'd feel as a triplet. I've always hoped my friends would pick someone who wasn't so closely tied to me.", "He\u2019s 24", "He wanted his sister to know, absolutely. I don't know if he wanted Chloe out or if he just wanted to bug his sister and Chloe was the 1st one stupid enough to join in his game.\n\nIn any event, Chloe was warned, knew the rules and the consequences. There was 1 guy in France she couldn't sleep with and she choose to sleep w/ him. Chloe F'ed around and found out. Unless she was assaulted, this is 100% on her.", "Do we know Chloe consented to the \u201ccompromising position \u201c?", "Yes but not when asked specifically by your friend. \nWhen people are in my house they can do whatever they like but when they fuck on my bed there out of there but apparently you find that kind of stuff oke? She can do drugs also because hey she's an adult. Please...real friends don't do this kind of shit", "than she can also pay for her own accommodations", "That's the information I was looking for. Not saying the boundary can't exist just asking why it does.\nIt was not mentioned in OP's original post why The friend was against this. The neither mocking hi sister about it is the reason.", "They were doing it in the middle of the kitchen, Chloe is an idiot.", "In the kitchen!", "Sounds like it. If she was assaulted, I'm sure she would have pled her case to OP instead of saying  don't tell\". \n\nIt is always possible, but since there is no indication of that we have to assume consent to answer the post.", "One would hope that if OP had walked into the brother r@ping Chloe in the middle of the kitchen, that she would have been calling the police....", "Because she can't stop or control him. I would say it's obvious that her parents %100 allow him to walk all over his sister or he wouldn't have gotten to share the house during her birthday trip....", "No, what real friends don't do is dictate each others sex lives. The rule wasn't \"no sex in the house\" or \"no sex in this particular bed\". It was no sex with the brother, period. Which is wrong, period. If the rule was \"no country music\" and she got caught with willie nelson playin in her headphones, every single person in this thread would call OP the AH. Having a stupid rule makes you an AH, and actually enforcing it makes you an even bigger AH.", "That\u2019s true, that why I also think brother wanted others to know about it. OP played in his hands. ESH", "I'm sorry but you are a terrible friend if you think that way. She doesn't dictate she just doesn't want her brother to be fucked by her friend for the holiday ks that really that much to ask? Wow ! Maybe you live in a world were its okay to disregard your friend wishes and to fuck your friends siblings but in the normal world thats not normal especially if it's asked to not do it on that holiday. How hard can it be to keep your legs closed? \nSo again op and her friend are NTA her friend Chloe is.", "How hard is it not to have ridiculous rules? So again op and her friend are YTA her friend Chloe isn't.", "It's not ridiculous it shouldn't even has to be said.\nprobably you are the kind of person who does this to friends because no healthy person would have sex with her friends brother at a holiday and where its asked not to do even if you are in love you wait because that's what friends do they respect each other. \nSo again NTA", "You are wrong, internet person. YTA."]}
