Either way, it should be understood that when it comes to dating a friend\u2019s sibling, respect your friend and talk to them. Romantic relationships crash and burn at a higher rate than friendships. Sometimes friends  establish rules like this because they know their siblings are toxic players.  Sometimes they do it because they are just spoiled brats who try to control their friends.  Either way, respecting your friend means respecting your friend\u2019s boundaries.\n\nElena\u2014Pure AH.

When we asked why, she said that her brother gets bored very quickly in a relationship and he once broke up with one of her friend. It was very messy to the point that her friend keep calling her, begging her to talk to her brother, to bring them back together. Said friend showed up at their parents house, pretending to visit her but once she spotted her brother she started screaming at him for breaking up with her. Her parents kicked her out after she called him all kinds of names under the sun. She doesn\u2019t want to be  in the middle again or lose another friend. She begged her brother not to mess with her friends but he kept ignoring it. He said that if they were true friends, they would respect her boundaries, because his friends respect his boundaries to keep their hands off her.
