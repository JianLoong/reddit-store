Especially since the rule apparently doesn't apply to the man who gets to sleep with whoever he wants with no repercussions, but the women who choose to sleep with him are in the wrong? \n\nHard to judge. Is just Elena an AH? Is it Elena and her brother both? You for playing along with this weird imposition on people's sexual autonomy? I dunno. Seems strange, though. The whole rule about it and only applying to the women and not the man definitely grosses me out, though.", "Lmao actually what the fuck \n\n\nIs everyone constantly scrambling to fuck her brother or something?\n\nESH. And let Elena know she's weird as fuck for policing who her brother sleeps with.", "NTA. I feel like this is really 100% on the brother. He seems like a spiteful little shit.", "Esh. Literally everyone, you, the brother, Chloe, and Elena. No one should kick a guest that is depending on them out in a foreign country unless it\u2019s a mater of safety, Chloe shouldn\u2019t have slept with the brother, Elena shouldn\u2019t be putting limits on her friends that she knows he brother will actively try to make them break, the brother is just an all around prolific asshole, and you\u2019re a shitty friend to Chloe. She\u2019s getting punished because the brother was bugging you, and brother is just going to try and sleep with another friend now.", "NTA - There was one rule, she broke the rule, unsure how that is your problem?\n\nHeck you were even willing to keep it secret until the brother was a knob.\n\nI think they both need to learn about personal accountability.", "ESH Chloe least of all she should be allowed to sleep with another concenting adult. But honestly,  you are so short temped and petty you could be goaded into fucking over your friend? Elena and her brother sound unpleasant to the extreme and happily fucking over other people in their stupid rivalry.", "NTA there was a clear rule in place and you did the right thing by telling your friend, especially if you we're being disrespected by the brother", "Like, that girl had a PAID trip to France and free accomodations and she couldn't keep her hoo-ha shut from ONE dude? I just don't understand the world anymore. \n\nI'd say NTA, that girl should have prepared for the possibility of being homeless if she's so bent on breaking the rules. It's not your responsibility that she has the libido of rabbit.", "NTA! You were keeping yourself out of it until the brother kept goating you, which he seems to have a history of. If he was worried he would have left you alone. And yes, no friend should go against their friend's wishes like Chloe did. \n\nPlus as a brother that is pretty shitty too, I always had the rule of not dating or dipping my toes in my sibling's friend group. So easy to create issues.", "ESH \n\n* because you were angry at the brother you did something that hurt your friend, not him. \n* the brother for going out of his way to upset you\n* Chloe for messing with the brother against her friends wishes and doing it so obviously that they got caught\n* Elena for making a stupid rule for her friends (and, I suspect, getting mad at her friend instead of her brother).", "NTA, Elena could have been smarter in this situation, and you have nothing to do with the main issue at hand. I believe it is OK that she restricted anyone from sleeping with her brother, but I do not agree with her decision to evict someone from a settlement in a\u00a0\u00a0foreign nation. She might have simply told her that it was wrong, but it would only be reasonable if\u00a0Elena's brother was old enough to be having relationships with people, he should be allowed to make his own decisions without interference from others. Elena could have done things differently, but you just did what was right and expected of you.", "NTA....no friend goes against her friends wishes like Chloe did.\nHe kept on irritating you and its not your secret too keep so goodbye Chloe", "ESH. I cannot imagine caring who my brother hooks up with, as long as they\u2019re legal and consenting. That\u2019s weird. Does her brother have a thing for you? Have you turned him down in the past? Or do you have a thing for him? I am just reading between the lines here, but why is always goading you specifically? Why does he have that power over you? I do think it\u2019s lame that you ratted out Chloe because you were mad at Elena\u2019s brother. Chloe shouldn\u2019t have hooked up with him, though, if she doesn\u2019t have feelings for him, bc her friend asked her not to. Now if she had a relationship with him, that\u2019s different. But you can do without a one night stand if it would upset your friend.", "NTA. Elena had a rule. Chloe broke it.

What a stupid rule, but it is a rule so I guess NTA but you all are adults, its weird his sister is controlling who sleeps with who.", "Mmhhh... ESH.

Lol this woman had a fully paid trip with the ONLY rule being to not to sleep with her friend's brother.  She couldn't find anyone else?  Is he the owner of the sole penis in a 50 mile radius??  It's generally pretty icky to dictate the sex lives of 2 consenting adults but this just seems almost spiteful for the brother and friend to do at this point.

But either way taking all of them on a trip to France and then kicking a friend out in a foreign because she slept with your brother? Like I get it was a boundary and I completely understand that, but this situation is overall weird and somewhat creepy.\n\nIt's incredibly weird that the sister made a rule to not fuck her brother, her friend is kind of an AH for sleeping with the brother despite knowing that it was a boundary (but realistically it's none of anyone's business except her and the brother), the brother is an AH for harassing OP, OP is an AH for getting a friend kicked out, purely out of spite, because clearly OP didn't actually take any issue with them sleeping together. That seems like something that she should have taken up with the brother and not thrown her friend under the bus for it. \n\nI'm also curious to know where they fucking in a somewhat public place or did she just walk into somebody's room without knocking?\n\nOverall the entire situation is a shitshow", "Yeah I've never had a friend with a brother who felt the need to ask her friends not to sleep with him like this.

I guess he didn\u2019t?", "She didn't choose to enter it, she stumbled across them. She then agreed to do them a favour and the brother decided it was somehow a good idea to use that favour against her. They're completely to blame.", "The unfairness of the rule wasn't the question here though. I can't tell why such a rule was put in place but the rule was directed towards the guests and as such they should respect it or simply not come on the trip. \n\nEven though I have no such Draconian rules in my house, but my house does equal my rules. It's not suggestions, it's rules I'd like my guests to abide by to respect my living environment and property. If it's too much for some people, then they are no longer welcome. \nIt doesn't even have to be anything ridiculous, but even something as basic as taking off your shoes before coming in.", "And it will probably happen again. First and foremost OP probably should have left her brother at home.", "He does it because you let him get under your skin and that amuses him. If you would just move on and not give him the reaction he wants, it would end. Why punish your friend Chloe?", "She wasn\u2019t even sent home.

While I can understand not wanting the fall out if the 'relationship' turns ugly, it's not her business who her friends or her brother decides to date or hook up with.\n\nChloe-When you're dependent on someone else, it makes sense to respect them.\n\nBrother- All around shit starter.\n\nYou- Your sole reason for telling Elena was because 'the brother' kept 'goading' you. You mean to tell me that man doing or saying anything has that much power over you? No matter what he did, if Chloe was a friend to you, you very much shared her personal business when it had nothing to do with you. Girlfriend is literally stranded in a foreign country. You should feel bad about that.\n\nAll of you are immature AHs.", "YTA, then.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, Elena is, too, for trying to control two grown adults\u2019 sex lives in the first place and only putting the blame when that didn\u2019t work on the one she thinks she should be able to control, even though the mere fact she apparently didn\u2019t think telling her brother to stay away from her friends would work should\u2019ve demonstrated the futility of the exercise.  But this was none of your business *at all*, no matter how badly you think you were goaded.  Again, if the brother\u2019s that much of a jerk, why did Elena subject you all to him, much less expect you to keep him under control?", "The ESH elena for that BS rule everyone is an adult who could have easily told ger brother not to sleep with any of her friends, how come he ain't kicked out?  Chloe for not having better sense than to fool around in a common area. The brother because he was just goading you and being unconcerned of how this could effect chloe.
