Either way, it should be understood that when it comes to dating a friend\u2019s sibling, respect your friend and talk to them. Romantic relationships crash and burn at a higher rate than friendships. Sometimes friends  establish rules like this because they know their siblings are toxic players.  Sometimes they do it because they are just spoiled brats who try to control their friends.  Either way, respecting your friend means respecting your friend\u2019s boundaries.\n\nElena\u2014Pure AH.

When we asked why, she said that her brother gets bored very quickly in a relationship and he once broke up with one of her friend. It was very messy to the point that her friend keep calling her, begging her to talk to her brother, to bring them back together. Said friend showed up at their parents house, pretending to visit her but once she spotted her brother she started screaming at him for breaking up with her. Her parents kicked her out after she called him all kinds of names under the sun. She doesn\u2019t want to be  in the middle again or lose another friend. She begged her brother not to mess with her friends but he kept ignoring it. He said that if they were true friends, they would respect her boundaries, because his friends respect his boundaries to keep their hands off her.

Is everyone just so horned up for the brother? Good god. NTA, but dang is your friend group weird AF.", "what in the CW did I just read", "Nta, Chloe had one rule to follow and couldn\u2019t keep her pants zipped. She literally took advantage of her friend\u2019s generosity and threw her one rule back in her face. Looks like the consequences of her own actions to me. I think the brother should have also been kicked out, but mommy and daddy were paying so that would never happen. You were being a good friend to the bday girl, if Chloe would do this then what else would she do.", "This! Summed it up, nicely!", "It's not a \"stupid rule\" it's a boundary Elena has set and Chloe chose to break it", "Trying to police who other people fuck on vacation is absolutely an asshole move.", "OP really was his good little snitch", "And your response to him goading you was to do something that would have no negative consequences for him whatsoever and would only result in a friend being kicked out and homeless in a foreign country?\n\nYou\u2019re an asshole, childish, a bad friend, and a nasty person.", "> who fucks their friends brothers\n\nLots of people which is why people marrying the sibling of their friend isn\u2019t rare at all.", "She knew the rule, she chose to break it", "But OP didn\u2019t do the kicking. Elena did. The true question is did OP know Elena would react this harshly? My guess is OP is just as stunned by Elena\u2019s actions as we are.", "I\u2019m not saying she won\u2019t be fine. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a shitty thing to do to a person", "What's with this weird fetish n bunch of weirdos wanting to duck someone's brother \ud83d\ude10 and even the brother wanting to duck bunch of his sister's friends and can't they relax n control their sex drive bruh...", "NTA - Chloe decided to do something and didn't expect consequences. Oh well.", "I mean, she knew she shouldn't and she did it anyway. You'd be in the wrong to lie to your other friend. Actions have consequences and I'm assuming she knew that. NTA", "Uh.... I think you need new friends, my dude.....", "NTA.  You should have just told her immediately, as keeping quiet for Chloe disrespected Elena.  Who cares what Elana's brother says or thinks?  He is nothing to you.  Make sure he knows that.", "NTA, but why did Elena bring her brother along?", "Sounds like brother has a major crush on OP and is trying to prove to her what a catch/stud he is.   But because he is really immature is using every/any woman with the bad judgment to get with him. \n\nChloe is the collateral damage because she was stupid enough to sleep with him knowing the consequences.  I honestly don\u2019t feel bad at all for Chloe, there was one rule for the all expense paid vacation and she thought she could break it. \n\nBrother honestly couldn\u2019t care less about Chloe since he pressed/goaded the OP to tell and possibly planned for her to \u201ccatch\u201d them together.   \n\nSounds like a \u201cbully romance\u201d written for teenagers.", "Somehow this sounds like a Schitt's Creek prequel but with David being the birthday kid, and telling his friends  \"Don't fuck my sister.\"\n\nAlexis of course would do whatever she wanted.\n\nESH", "YTA. Elena too.\n\nElena is an asshole for policing her brother's sex life, and you're an asshole for not minding your business.", "ironically her 'rule' probably kicked the attraction of her brother up a few notches as well.\n\n\"forbidden fruit\" and all", "I get why most of the people in this post sucks but does this include OP if so why?", "Agreed! It's not fair that Chloe got punished as the brother clearly was poking fun at the whole thing for his own gratification. From Elena's warning this is common behaviour, and she clearly wasn't happy that himand his mates were coming. Honestly he sounds like he needs a good kicking.\ud83d\ude02", "He\u2019s a straight up Disney channel movie villain.", "My money is on something like ... https://images.app.goo.gl/GFR3Vhm71d7fatMb7", "She's not even \"homeless,\" she can go home if she wants to. I'm sure she can change her flight", "Goading vs Goating\n\nTotally different words lol", "Family members sleeping with friends can get messy real quick. You don\u2019t want a person you care about talking trash/harassing you or another person you care about because things didn\u2019t work out. And in the kitchen when there are lots of other people? That\u2019s just disrespectful.", "Chloe didn't give a shot shit about herself! She deceived her own friend. Play stupid games...", "Between the goading and calling her a 'good little snitch' it kind of seems like this was his intended goal? \n\nLike he sees his sister's friends as conquests, but then he was able to both needle his sister and OP \\*and\\* remove his booty call from his presence in one fell swoop. If he was invested in OP not snitching on them he would have let her be.", "The reason I included OP is because she initially didn't take any issue with them having sex, she only did did it after the brother kept messing with her. The reason I think she's the assholes because instead of just addressing it with him she threw Chloe under the bus too and got her kicked out in a foreign country.", "I cannot control what my brother does in my parents house where they have allowed him to be. I can control that I will not have friends in my parents house who will fuck my brother.", "I disagree that OP was ok with it based solely on not telling Elena from the jump. I think OP understood it would cause a problem and tried to mind her own business. Just, Brother wouldn\u2019t stop needling her and Elena knew OP well enough to know that OP was not having fun. Some people are just bad at keeping secrets because secrets are pressure. Everyone acts like secrets get out because people want to gossip, but the truth is secrets can really weigh on some people. And OP does not sound like a sociopath, so I don\u2019t doubt she is in this category. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone would have predicted the extreme that Elena went to. Yes, OP was clearly bothered by Brother and Chloe is collateral damage here. But did Chloe get dealt a punishment that outmeasures her \u201ccrime\u201d? Hell yes. Does anyone honestly think OP knew Elena would react this way?", ">Yeah I'm not sure if it's the brother who's the issue or the friends\n\nI mean, based on the fact that the brother kept goading OP, and called her a \"good little snitch\" I'm pretty certain he's toxic. But, then him and his friends shouldn't have been invited and it should have just been a girls trip", "I just don\u2019t understand why there is one rule \u201cdon\u2019t F my brother\u201d and this one friend just can\u2019t manage that?  If you\u2019re not dating him, how is it so difficult to follow this one rule while on vacation? I mean, when I was in my 20\u2019s I was a Chloe 100% but I would have accepted my punishment.", "Wonder if the brother has a specific issue with the ONS and did it to *get her* kicked out", "Yep. Total vibe I got. My brother was always trying to \"meet my friends\" as soon as I was old enough for my friends to be fuckable. Never took much interest in me or my life before that, given he's nine years older than me", "Ok that\u2019s a good point it makes me wonder why Elena doesn\u2019t stop taking her brother", "Because he's an AH and sounds like a f**kboy.  Sounds like the type who would see it as a challenge.", "This! \ud83d\ude05 their making it seem like she got abducted and is now a part of isis, like chill she\u2019s in Paris not Iraq. She\u2019ll be fine lol", "rich people with their cruel intentions"]}
