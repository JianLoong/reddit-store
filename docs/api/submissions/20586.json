My boss and I get along great and sometimes hang out outside of work along with a couple other coworkers. Last year we had a company picnic at our local amusement park/picnic area. We had a good time but in the middle of it everyone, my boss included, wanted me to start getting on amusement park rides with them. I told them (and told them once before we even went), that I don\u2019t do rides but I\u2019ll hang out while they go, no big deal. They pressured and badgered me for a couple minutes with \u2018oh come on, don\u2019t be a whimp, have a little fun.\u2019 Even though I knew better, I got sick of it and was finally like \u2018okay fine, I\u2019ll do it.\u2019 \n\nWe get on this stand-up spinning type deal, everyone is having a great time and I\u2019m 100% going to puke. After a bit of self-talk I get through it, we get off and I make it about five feet before I fucking lost it. Meanwhile while I proceeded to projectile vomit, my boss and my coworker snapped a photo of me and were laughing their asses off, even sent the photo to someone who wasn\u2019t there to be like \u2018ha, you\u2019re totally missing this!\u2019 At that point I\u2019m irritated because I didn\u2019t want to do it in the first place and I know I shouldn\u2019t have, I don\u2019t feel well and now I have the people I thought were cool with me kind of being assholes (who then also posted this photo online which wasn\u2019t cool.) \n\nAt the same time it wasn\u2019t the end of the world so I got over it quickly, life moved on and it was forgotten. The year went by and last week, my boss announced that yet again we were going to have the same event at the same place. He looked over and made a joke about \u2018you think you\u2019ll be able to handle it this time?\u2019, while nudging me in the arm. I decided to tell him I wasn\u2019t going because it wasn\u2019t really for me and I didn\u2019t want to bring down the vibe. Not much was said until the morning of, where my boss texted me \u2018where are you?\u2019 I let him know that I again didn\u2019t want to attend this year because of what happened last year, and I felt no one wanted to respect my boundaries. He has been upset since then and hasn\u2019t said much, and I don\u2019t know if maybe i was too sensitive about it. \n\nI would have been perfectly fine going and tagging along without the rides but since they didn\u2019t want to take no for an answer last year, I didn\u2019t want to feel uncomfortable about it this year and repeat it all over again.

You getting on the ride is you not holding a boundary but the jeers, ridicule and photo blasts are ahole moves. Most people with self worth would decline.", "NTA, sweetie, and you may want to look for another job.  You work with bullies.\n\nAlso, \"I have other plans that weekend,\" is a perfectly fine excuse.  Your plans can be sitting in your jammies with your kitty or puppy scrolling through Reddit, but they're still plans.\n\nYou do not owe your employer any excuse for your time outside of work.  Brush up that resume.", "NTA. And look for a new job. Your coworkers sound like a piece of work. Also, you might be able to take legal action regarding the photo that was shared without your consent. In any case, look for a new job.", "I think you should've gone, and joined the your boss and co-worker on the rides. But only to make sure they were in range of your vomiting. They wouldn't find it so funny then.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, your boss will get over it.", "NTA.  No need to extrapolate.  No need to reference the previous issues.  You aren't going to get an apology so trying to guilt them into one won't work either.  If you feel the need for an excuse just tell them you have other plans.", "NTA I actually agree with the comment that said look for a new job. If your coworkers and boss were teenagers this would be perfectly normal, and you may even come across as a bit of a spoilsport. If they\u2019re full blown adults and behaving this way, you\u2019ll find you won\u2019t view them the same way once you get a little older.\n\nAlso some older people tend to let their insecurities and insecure or immature behavior run rampant around younger people because you won\u2019t notice and they think you \u201ccan handle it\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it manipulative, but it\u2019s def using you.", "NTA\n\nHR or a labor lawyer might refer to this as a \"hostile work environment\"", "NTA It's your right to say no! It is OK to say no!\nIt's understandable and reasonable to say no in this case.", "NTA, can you get a new job?", "NTA.\n\nMake a point of vomiting ON the boss and see if he finds it half so funny.", "NTA. They were rude and were assholes.", "NTA. Not sure why but you always come into undue pressure to conform and join in at work events regardless of personal or health issues. They promise they want but in the moment, that never lasts. I tend to opt out if physically can't do it but still HR pressure to go because they won't demand. No, just make it hard to say no.\n\nYou had a bad experience. They laughed at you about it. Not sure why they'd expect you to want to repeat it.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I would see it as completely fair to just be blunt with them about the reason - last time you went they acted like complete assholes towards you, bullied you into doing things you didn't want to, and not only ruined your day but have regularly harassed you about it since. Why would you want to go and risk a repeat of any of that?", "NTA, you should never feel like we need to attend a work party function", "NTA,... but some advice, take it all in good fun, even if you dont feel that way. Your boss might feel guilty now and that could turn into projecting bs onto you and make things uncomfortable.\n\nYou should have said, you dont want to go because of what hapoened last year and kept it at that.

Like now.\n\nHostile work environment requires discrimination of a protected class.  OP hasn't said this was done because OP was a protected class.

I don\u2019t think I would have mentioned it at all if not for the \u2018think you\u2019ll be able to handle it this time?\u2019 comment.

But getting bullied by your boss by having photos put online (aside: you're misreprenting my point by bringing up OP going on the ride), yes, is an example of unwelcome conduct.
