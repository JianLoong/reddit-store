My boss and I get along great and sometimes hang out outside of work along with a couple other coworkers. Last year we had a company picnic at our local amusement park/picnic area. We had a good time but in the middle of it everyone, my boss included, wanted me to start getting on amusement park rides with them. I told them (and told them once before we even went), that I don\u2019t do rides but I\u2019ll hang out while they go, no big deal. They pressured and badgered me for a couple minutes with \u2018oh come on, don\u2019t be a whimp, have a little fun.\u2019 Even though I knew better, I got sick of it and was finally like \u2018okay fine, I\u2019ll do it.\u2019 \n\nWe get on this stand-up spinning type deal, everyone is having a great time and I\u2019m 100% going to puke. After a bit of self-talk I get through it, we get off and I make it about five feet before I fucking lost it. Meanwhile while I proceeded to projectile vomit, my boss and my coworker snapped a photo of me and were laughing their asses off, even sent the photo to someone who wasn\u2019t there to be like \u2018ha, you\u2019re totally missing this!\u2019 At that point I\u2019m irritated because I didn\u2019t want to do it in the first place and I know I shouldn\u2019t have, I don\u2019t feel well and now I have the people I thought were cool with me kind of being assholes (who then also posted this photo online which wasn\u2019t cool.) \n\nAt the same time it wasn\u2019t the end of the world so I got over it quickly, life moved on and it was forgotten. The year went by and last week, my boss announced that yet again we were going to have the same event at the same place. He looked over and made a joke about \u2018you think you\u2019ll be able to handle it this time?\u2019, while nudging me in the arm. I decided to tell him I wasn\u2019t going because it wasn\u2019t really for me and I didn\u2019t want to bring down the vibe. Not much was said until the morning of, where my boss texted me \u2018where are you?\u2019 I let him know that I again didn\u2019t want to attend this year because of what happened last year, and I felt no one wanted to respect my boundaries. He has been upset since then and hasn\u2019t said much, and I don\u2019t know if maybe i was too sensitive about it. \n\nI would have been perfectly fine going and tagging along without the rides but since they didn\u2019t want to take no for an answer last year, I didn\u2019t want to feel uncomfortable about it this year and repeat it all over again.

This is not an issue of justification, or grievances. You are talking about a yearly work event intended to foster camaraderie among the staff. Your participation (attendance, attitude, social support, bonding) will impact your career. How you get along with others, especially in a small company, will affect how they feel about you, and that will have a lot to do with being considered for projects, promotions, and even who gets invited for drinks after work. A work-related event is never just a fun time, it's part of the ongoing evaluation process. Sulking and avoiding can change how your co-workers and your superiors see you. If you like working there, or if you hope to leave with a great reference, think about your actions from the viewpoint of others. \n\nTake ownership of the fact that when pressed, you did not handle the situation like someone with confidence and grace. If you did not like their pushing, it was up to you to find an acceptable way to say so. If you did not want to ride, it was up to you to say no, and suggest something else, or gracefully exit. Sometimes a little fib is acceptable: I'm really not feeling well, something must not agree with me.
