My boss and I get along great and sometimes hang out outside of work along with a couple other coworkers. Last year we had a company picnic at our local amusement park/picnic area. We had a good time but in the middle of it everyone, my boss included, wanted me to start getting on amusement park rides with them. I told them (and told them once before we even went), that I don\u2019t do rides but I\u2019ll hang out while they go, no big deal. They pressured and badgered me for a couple minutes with \u2018oh come on, don\u2019t be a whimp, have a little fun.\u2019 Even though I knew better, I got sick of it and was finally like \u2018okay fine, I\u2019ll do it.\u2019 \n\nWe get on this stand-up spinning type deal, everyone is having a great time and I\u2019m 100% going to puke. After a bit of self-talk I get through it, we get off and I make it about five feet before I fucking lost it. Meanwhile while I proceeded to projectile vomit, my boss and my coworker snapped a photo of me and were laughing their asses off, even sent the photo to someone who wasn\u2019t there to be like \u2018ha, you\u2019re totally missing this!\u2019 At that point I\u2019m irritated because I didn\u2019t want to do it in the first place and I know I shouldn\u2019t have, I don\u2019t feel well and now I have the people I thought were cool with me kind of being assholes (who then also posted this photo online which wasn\u2019t cool.) \n\nAt the same time it wasn\u2019t the end of the world so I got over it quickly, life moved on and it was forgotten. The year went by and last week, my boss announced that yet again we were going to have the same event at the same place. He looked over and made a joke about \u2018you think you\u2019ll be able to handle it this time?\u2019, while nudging me in the arm. I decided to tell him I wasn\u2019t going because it wasn\u2019t really for me and I didn\u2019t want to bring down the vibe. Not much was said until the morning of, where my boss texted me \u2018where are you?\u2019 I let him know that I again didn\u2019t want to attend this year because of what happened last year, and I felt no one wanted to respect my boundaries. He has been upset since then and hasn\u2019t said much, and I don\u2019t know if maybe i was too sensitive about it. \n\nI would have been perfectly fine going and tagging along without the rides but since they didn\u2019t want to take no for an answer last year, I didn\u2019t want to feel uncomfortable about it this year and repeat it all over again.

If your coworkers and boss were teenagers this would be perfectly normal, and you may even come across as a bit of a spoilsport. If they\u2019re full blown adults and behaving this way, you\u2019ll find you won\u2019t view them the same way once you get a little older.\n\nAlso some older people tend to let their insecurities and insecure or immature behavior run rampant around younger people because you won\u2019t notice and they think you \u201ccan handle it\u201d.

No, just make it hard to say no.\n\nYou had a bad experience. They laughed at you about it. Not sure why they'd expect you to want to repeat it.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I would see it as completely fair to just be blunt with them about the reason - last time you went they acted like complete assholes towards you, bullied you into doing things you didn't want to, and not only ruined your day but have regularly harassed you about it since. Why would you want to go and risk a repeat of any of that?", "NTA, you should never feel like we need to attend a work party function", "NTA,... but some advice, take it all in good fun, even if you dont feel that way.

They knew as soon as they wore you down that they were free to do whatever they wanted to you, and they did. It's unbelievable that your boss and the others are licking their chops in anticipation of being able to do that again. What a toxic work environment.

Like now.\n\nHostile work environment requires discrimination of a protected class.  OP hasn't said this was done because OP was a protected class. Ergo, it's not hostile work environment in any legal sense that an employment lawyer could address. Labor lawyers deal with union things, not employment things.", "Understandable. I don\u2019t think I would have mentioned it at all if not for the \u2018think you\u2019ll be able to handle it this time?\u2019 comment.

But getting bullied by your boss by having photos put online (aside: you're misreprenting my point by bringing up OP going on the ride), yes, is an example of unwelcome conduct. I personally wouldn't want to work at a place like that.

Your boss is silent bc it finally occurred to him that you weren\u2019t laughing too. My family would get angry at me for not being able to take a joke. Bullies don\u2019t like that part pointed out. I hope this makes you stronger with boundaries in the future. You get motion sick!", "NTA. Let the little bully boy be upset that he didn't get his way and ruin the vibe. All the other employees will see how toxic he is.", "NTA, but I would go and give them the show they wanted, a very close-up personal experience that will leave them feeling all warm.", "NTA - If anyone in HR was present and didn't rip the shit out of your boss they suck at their job. Totally reasonable to blow it off. Even the language they used to make you ride was out of bounds, their behavior after should be a 'convince me not to fire you if you think that's the actions of a responsible boss' territory for HR.\n\nThe acting like a jilted teenager when you explained like an adult why you weren't attending the 'fun day' that would be no fun for you is triply problematic.", "NTA. How rude your coworkers treated you like that last year. So sorry to hear that.", "Don't be looking for people who give stupid advice, like puke on your boss. This is not an issue of justification, or grievances. You are talking about a yearly work event intended to foster camaraderie among the staff. Your participation (attendance, attitude, social support, bonding) will impact your career. How you get along with others, especially in a small company, will affect how they feel about you, and that will have a lot to do with being considered for projects, promotions, and even who gets invited for drinks after work. A work-related event is never just a fun time, it's part of the ongoing evaluation process. Sulking and avoiding can change how your co-workers and your superiors see you. If you like working there, or if you hope to leave with a great reference, think about your actions from the viewpoint of others. \n\nTake ownership of the fact that when pressed, you did not handle the situation like someone with confidence and grace. If you did not like their pushing, it was up to you to find an acceptable way to say so. If you did not want to ride, it was up to you to say no, and suggest something else, or gracefully exit. Sometimes a little fib is acceptable: I'm really not feeling well, something must not agree with me. And never blow off a company event - that looks rude to the bosses sponsoring it, and makes a statement that you don't think well of your co-workers.", "NTA They should have respected your boundaries", "NTA.

That's called harassment.", "Bro your boss is the one that should be contemplating if he was an asshole. And he was. \n\nMight be a cool guy but he\u2019s a shitty boss.", "NTA\n\nTheir behavior last year was egregious. Not helping you? Bad. Laughing? WTF. Taking photos? Are you fucking kidding me? *Posting* it? Nuclear. Why are you still at this job? \n\nYour boss should be upset. He majorly fucked up.\n\n\"Can't you take a joke?\" is the coward's bullshit attempt to avoid responsibility for their own shitty action.\n\nGood on you for not going, but you might want to work on keeping firm to your boundaries with no apologies. I'm in the same boat you are- even looking at a spin-and-barf ride makes me queasy. I will not tolerate someone's trying to tease/shame/dare me to ride one.\n\"No, I'll puke.\" \"Unless you're volunteering to let me puke on you, drop it.\" \"Drop. It.\" And then they get the little AH sticker next to their name in my mental book and it stays there unless they apologize sincerely.", "NTA", "NTA.  However...hanging out with the boss outside of work.  Bad idea.  Never ends well for person of 'lower' rank.", "\"You're too sensitive about it\"?  No.  He's gaslighting you.

It's his.  \n\nAdequate responses can vary from a simple, yet professional, \"no\", to a more retributional, \"I'm going to puke all over you if I go\".  \n\nIt's entirely your choice.

At the other day as long as they don't bring that personal situations into work then it is fine.", "The picture being taken at all, let alone shown to anyone not there, is among the rudest things Ive ever heard\n\nIf someone is projectile vomiting in front of me I\u2019m making sure theyre okay or getting them water, not laughing and taking pics. His coworkers sound awful", "Next year take motion sickness meds and don't eat heavy stuff. Then once they are full take them on the tea cups.
