I'm going with NAH.\n\nIt's reasonable for a boy to play in his room.  It is reasonable to be quiet for a baby to sleep.  It's reasonable to ask your son to be quiet during certain times. It's reasonable to ask daughter to move to a quieter location of the house.\n\nThe issue comes down to your daughter moving into a home where there is already an established family dynamic.  You will all need to find a solution together.  That may be a combination of daughter and grandbaby moving to quieter attic and sitting down son and saying \"between noon and 2 is quiet time because the baby is sleeping\".  I know it's hard to monitor a baby's sleeping pattern in that way, but some kind of boundaries need to be set with your son to accommodate the new house addition.", "YTA\n\nI'm on the autism spectrum as well.  And your permitting your autistic son to be loud is upsetting the baby.  And it won't help your son eventually learn to be more functional in social settings.  A key part of that is learning to modulate your voice volume.\n\nHonestly, he should be learning at least how to behave in more socially acceptable ways.   There are therapists who specialize in teaching kids with autism how to have better social skills.  One of those is, again, not being loud all the time.\n\nI'd take him to one of those sooner rather than later.  It will help him immensely to learn that earlier rather than later in life.  Otherwise, when he's a teen and starts craving a closer connection with his peers, it will be **HELL** for him.
