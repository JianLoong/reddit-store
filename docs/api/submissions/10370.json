We have an 8 year old son together with autism. My husband has a daughter 18Cara from a previous relationship.

This doesn\u2019t include late at night, he goes to bed early, and does homeschooling with me through out the morning and early afternoon, so he\u2019s not being loud at unreasonable hours. \n\nThe issue is his bedroom is right next to Caras.  Cara often complains to her father about how loud our son is being. The other day he woke up the baby on accident and she came out screaming at him to shut his mouth.  I intervened and told her not to speak to him like that, then I asked her how is she going to ask him to be quiet in his own bedroom. She got quiet and went back to her room. My husband was at work when this occurred and I guess she texted him and my husband came home upset with me and sent our son to bed an hour early. He told me we needed to have a talk with our son about being quieter because now there is a baby in the house, and that if he does not oblige he will have punishable consequences. \n\nI became upset because I feel as though him sending our son to bed early was an \u201cadvertisement\u201d of these consequences. I don\u2019t feel that\u2019s fair. He\u2019s a young boy, he\u2019s quiet through out the house and has his fun in his bedroom. He\u2019s homeschooled and has no friends, he already has difficulties socially due to his autism. I told my husband where is he suppose to be play then? We have no yard. Then I reminded him, she was living in our sons home with an infant, that if he had an issue he could take our son to a park to play or she could move their bedroom to the attic. \n\nNow my husband and my stepdaughter are upset with me.

Cara is behaving like a typical emotional teenager, which would be understandable if thats all she was. But she's a mom now and she's gonna have to grow her ass up.", "Ugh.  I'm going with NAH.\n\nIt's reasonable for a boy to play in his room.  It is reasonable to be quiet for a baby to sleep.  It's reasonable to ask your son to be quiet during certain times. It's reasonable to ask daughter to move to a quieter location of the house.\n\nThe issue comes down to your daughter moving into a home where there is already an established family dynamic.  You will all need to find a solution together.  That may be a combination of daughter and grandbaby moving to quieter attic and sitting down son and saying \"between noon and 2 is quiet time because the baby is sleeping\".  I know it's hard to monitor a baby's sleeping pattern in that way, but some kind of boundaries need to be set with your son to accommodate the new house addition.", "YTA\n\nI'm on the autism spectrum as well.  And your permitting your autistic son to be loud is upsetting the baby.  And it won't help your son eventually learn to be more functional in social settings.  A key part of that is learning to modulate your voice volume.\n\nHonestly, he should be learning at least how to behave in more socially acceptable ways.   There are therapists who specialize in teaching kids with autism how to have better social skills.  One of those is, again, not being loud all the time.\n\nI'd take him to one of those sooner rather than later.  It will help him immensely to learn that earlier rather than later in life.  Otherwise, when he's a teen and starts craving a closer connection with his peers, it will be **HELL** for him.   And he won't understand why.\n\nIt's ridiculous to insist your husband and the new baby change **their** living arrangements because your autistic son has not yet learned how to be quieter when asked.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Accomodate by changing the rooming situation, i.e. relocate one of them. Understandable that Husband wants to look out for daughter and grandkid, also since you are the one primarily being in charge of son, he maybe has it more difficult to understand why the making noise thing might be important for him. Daughter understandably is nervous because of her beeing a new parent and i assume having certain stress factors (that lie behind her moving in back with Husband). You yourself naturally feel the need to be sticking out for son since who else could.", "NTA but shitty situation. If they were smart, they would just find a pack and play on the quiet part of the house for nap time.", "NAH \n\nInfo: why home school? As a former teacher I have to say the most disturbing part of this post is \u201che has no friends.\u201d Children with Autism aren\u2019t precluded from learning how to socialize and there\u2019s many wonderful programs out there for special needs kids. You know your situation better than me of course but spending all day alone isn\u2019t going to be healthy in the long run.", "NTA!!\n\nI can not express how important it is for kids to have a safe place, and for autistic kids this is even more important. If he\u2019s only being loud when he\u2019s in his room and has privacy, it\u2019s probably because that\u2019s where he can unmask and stim safely. It\u2019s SO important for autistic kids not to be forced to \u201cshut up and act normal\u201d. \n\nHe\u2019s no being absurdly loud and he\u2019s not doing it at unreasonable times. Cara is lucky to be getting so much help, she needs to act a little more grateful and understanding, but I understand how tough being a new mom is as well.", "YTA", "NAH\n\nDo some of you realise that Cara JUST had a baby????? Like she gave birth man. She needs some peace. \n\nI\u2019m all for your son doing what he wants in his own room or his house because it\u2019s HIS but that doesn\u2019t mean Cara is being unreasonable!!", "NTA, however, is there another room the baby can sleep in. Sharing a wall with your son might prove difficult. An infant sharing a wall with any noisy room could be problematic, not just your son.\n\nBut I'm also wondering what your husband hoped to accomplish by sending your neurodivergent son to bed early for this. Is he under treatment for his autism? And is your husband on board with it?", "NTA - use a rain machine or white noise.", "How does your husband feel about your son having autism? Does he resent it? Does he understand it?\n\nIt doesn't sound like he does. Your son is being an 8 year old and he gets send to his room early for it. \n\nNtA", "NTA\n\nAs you know, new momming is hard. \n\nYour exhausted and cranky and so in love with your baby that anyone that upsets their contentedness becomes the object of your ire.\n\nThat said, any mom with more than one kid knows you are going to have a kid wake up the baby. How you react in that moment determines if you are an AH or not. Her reaction was to scream at her brother and play the victim. He's a little boy playing in his play space. The solution is to talk to the adults and see if the day can be shifted to accommodate baby's nap time. She's an adult and a mother, if someone treated her child the way she treated her brother, she would be livid.", "NTA. This is your son's home, and his bedroom should be his safe space. Cara is a legal adult who just moved into the bedroom next to your son's, and she feels entitled to scream at him for playing in his own room? Nope. Moving Cara and her kid's bedroom to the attic sounds like a fine solution. If that doesn't work for Cara, she's a grownup, she can find a different answer on her own that doesn't involve verbally abusing your child.", "NTA.  This is your son\u2019s home and you have every right to protect his interests.  Why are your son\u2019s needs less important than step daughter\u2019s?   Let husband offer solutions.  Maybe it\u2019s time for a house with a yard?", "Nta. If his vocalizations are a stim then punishing him for them will cause trauma. That's not a solution. I'm guessing she knew him when she moved in so she knew what the household was like. If it's a problem she needed to work that out before hand. It needs to be worked out now, which is harder, but not at the expense of your son's mental health.", "NTA. Babies don't need quiet to sleep. They'll sleep through almost anything. If the mother has created a quiet environment for the baby to sleep in, that's a problem of her own making.", "What a ride but NTA\n\nCara needs to learn patience and how to regulate emotions if she is going to be a good parent. I understand she is tired and stressed out, but normal new parents don't act like that. How she spoke to your son is not normal, and your husband needs to realise that.", "NTA. Why is the daughter rejecting the attic space? It can't be that far away and it can be made to be almost fully contained. Fully, if he adds a little bathroom. I will say that if it were me and push came to shove, I'd take my son and leave.", "Great response. And lets not forget how quickly the baby faze goes by. Over the course of a year the naps get shorter, the baby cries less, baby gets used to its uncle being a little noisy.    \nNAH", "We have a 3 bedroom house.  Their bedroom is in the same hallway, and mine is at the end in the living room sort of. There\u2019s a dip in the beginning of the livingroom which holds my bedroom door, so all the bedrooms are close by. There is a room in the attic we have made bedroom set up of sorts for guest, not really much but there\u2019s a tv and bed up there.
