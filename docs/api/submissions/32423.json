Although a bit overbudget, the house is situated a good neighborhood, has a good commute, and is walkable.\r  \n\r  \nWhen touring the home, the seller was physically present and gave us a tour of her house, pitching why it was a good buy. This was a bit strange to me as sellers usually leave during showings, but I guess it was still her house. During the walkthrough, the seller personally mentioned that she was very motivated to sell and was flexible with her move-out date as and there was no timeline she needed to follow.\r  \n\r  \nFast-forward to the end of October, we negotiate a fair price and set a closing date of November 30th. The seller then comes back and says she wants to live there until December 31st to get things situated, plus she wanted free leaseback for the month of December (What happened to having no timeline?). We countered back with a closing date of December 15th, with no leaseback option, as we have no interest in being landlords. Both parties agree and all is settled.\r  \n\r  \nNow, 10 days before closing, the Seller's Agent contacts my agent and says the Seller wants to do a leaseback until January 15th due to a family emergency, requiring the seller to travel out of state. I decline stating that I've already notified my current landlord that I'd be moving out by December 31st so we'll have no where to live. Also, the amount the seller offered to pay me in 'rent' wouldn't even cover my current rent, let alone a month of my new mortgage. I also already hired movers, started packing, and scheduled time off work to move-in.\r  \n\r  \nI feel really bad about his situation but everything feels a bit sus. We'll be under contract for 45+ days by time we close and conveniently something pops up in the last 10. I feel like we've already shown enough generosity by extending our initial closing date and not haggling the price down by much and now the seller is trying to take advantage of us.

Do not close if she is not prepared to leave. This is a business transaction. If you do not want to be a landlord, do not do this. She\u2019s already been wishy-washy on the timeline several times.

If you do a rent back and the time comes and she doesn\u2019t leave, you will have to take her to court and evict her.

If the seller is not able to move out and close by the appointment time on the 15th, then they will be in breach of contract.    If seller does plan to breach contract, then you plan to use all legal means necessary to be made whole.  This can include a lien on the home for any costs you are out.\n\nYour seller can call movers to pack and store their belongings and they can stay in a hotel until their new home is ready.\n\nAs a side note:  make sure to do a walkthrough immediately before the closing.

Walk away and get your earnest money back.

No need to feel guilty.", "NTA\n\nInsist on a walkthrough of the house before closing and after the seller has moved out.  Absolutely refuse to close if the seller hasn't completely moved out of the house.  \n\nIf you sign your closing documents and the seller is still in the house, it can be far more difficult and expensive to get them out of they delay leaving.\n\nTell your agent that they need to contact the Seller's agent and let them know you expect to have a walkthrough prior to closing and won't be closing if the seller hasn't moved out.  This will put pressure on the seller's agent to get the seller moving.\n\nAlso, once you close, change the locks asap.", "NAH - you both need to do what works for you and negotiating closing dates is common in real estate transactions.", "NAH\n\nThe reality is either you negotiate or not. And if not, the seller decides if they can accommodate the date, or the sale falls through.

Maybe they\u2019re a horrible procrastinator that hasn\u2019t even booked a moving company yet. Or they can\u2019t afford to pay for moving and packing until they have proceeds from the sale. I\u2019d counter with a move out date that you can live with and a reduction in price to cover the pro-rated mortgage payment and what ever you\u2019re paying for rent and storage and/or for changing your move date with moving company. Hopefully when the seller realizes it will cost them more to stay than leave they\u2019ll get their act together.", "NTA\n\nYou were nicer than you had to be.  You too are in a difficult situation with hard dates.  The seller will just have to figure it out.", "NTA, but your realtor is.  They should have explained the risks that you assume by allowing the former owner to stay in the house after closing.\n\nYou need a real estate attorney TODAY.  If you close and they remain in the property, IN MOST STATES you have just become a landlord and the protections that Tenants enjoy attach - you could easily be 90 - 120 days getting her out of the property.\n\nPut your soft heart away, get out the stone one and lay out some clear rules.  Also, make it clear to the realtor that you will be looking to them to help protect you, and will file a complaint with the Board of Realtors if they do not.  (They are making a buttload of money off of this, they are not your friend.  Tell them to do their job!)", "NTA. And IANAL. But I have faced a similar situation, and here is what we did, after consulting with real estate attorneys. We closed with seller in the house, and took possession of it at the close date. We essentially let them be guests in our house. They agreed to daily payment in the form of liquidated damages for their failure to fully honor the contract, which escalated onerously after the expected move out date. They stipulated that the payments were not rents and that they were not tenants. Not suggesting this is bulletproof by any means, but better than a leaseback.", "Nothing is done until closing has happened and the property has legally changed hands. An agreed upon closing date can absolutely change or be renegotiated for any number of reasons, emergency or not.", "> It\u2019s your house\n\nIt's not. OP hasn't closed on the house yet. They have a contact for the sale, but that contract ca be renegotiated or broken.", "Yes, seller is not going to be happy when asked to stick with the terms they agreed to. They may try to do something fishy to \"compensate\" for OP's unwillingness to acquiesce to their demands, so it pays to do extra due diligence at closing.", "> Can you walk away from the deal all together?\n\nBefore closing, yes, either party can walk away but often with consequences. The main question is how much money OP loses or the seller looses based on the current contract if they elect to back out. And if the seller's reasons or need to change the closing date provide a legal out for the contract to be cancelled without penalty.", "she needs to be out of state until mid january, she doens't need an Airbnb, she needs a storage locker.", "Depending on the jurisdiction, if all the contingencies have been lifted (which they usually would be after 30+ days of escrow), the seller may not have the option to walk away.\n\nAgain, it depends on the jurisdiction and the contingencies, but where I live, by that point in the process, the seller has to sell if the buyer shows up at closing with the money.", "Possibly it depends on where you are. Where I live, that deal is done.", "Not sure about seller but I'd be leaving 1% of the purchase price on the table if I leave the contract. On the flip side, interest rates have dropped a bit since I locked and I could potentially find a new lender with a 1% lower rate. Was planning to refinance down the line so this would just be a nice bonus.", "Where are they in the process. Have deposits been paid? Etc. That's why OPs agent is the best resource for advice. The agent has seen this before.", "\"loses\"", "What would make the prior closing date binding in that situation? How do you work it out if a closing date can't be agreed upon?", "How is a real estate deal done before closing? Closing is literally when the paperwork is finalized, the deed & money change hands.", "I know you are in a high stress situation, but when compared to a 30 year mortgage, a 30 day leaseback will look trivial in 5 years. Good luck.", "Where I live, there is a contract that is signed by both parties when the offer is accepted. That contract binds both parties to not only the closing date but also to any contingencies and the dates by which those contingencies must be cleared. If a contingency isn't cleared by the agreed upon date, then the sale falls through unless both parties agree to new terms. By the time that all contingencies are lifted, the seller doesn't have an option to walk away, only the buyer does. But if the buyer walks away, then there is usually a financial penalty, and depending on the state of the housing market and the value of the property, that financial penalty can be substantial. \n\nSo, in the case presented here, the originally agreed upon closing date would have been in a legally binding contract. The option for the seller to change that date would have been before said contract was signed and also before escrow was opened. Now, both parties can agree to change the terms of the contact at any point, but if either party declines, then the signed contact is what's legally binding.\n\nEdited: spelling", "You are very upset about this.\n\nYes, it is possible to change, but unless both parties agree, there are significant financial consequences.", "Only if the seller actually leave in 30 days. It already sounds like there is a lack of trust on OP's part.The only way I would do something like this is if 6+ mth of market rent is put in escrow from the sold price in case OP have to spend months to evict the seller. Anything less than that and I wouldn't agree", "No, I just want info. Don't confuse expecting details and justification with being angry or upset."]}
