The *warning* was \"Don't Drink\" he just gambled with what the consequences were going to be.

It's a bottle prune juice. It has your wife's name on it with a warning not to drink it. Apart from putting a warning label on the juice stating it's a natural laxative, you can't do much more. Tell your wife to try dried prunes if the juice isn't doing the trick.", "NTA - Oh look, its the consequences of his own actions!", "NTA, this is hilarious. you should tell him it also has placenta in it.", "You and your wife warned him by literally saying in the bottle not to drink it- NTA", "NTA, Let him suffer the kiss of the brown dragon and let it be a lesson.", "NTA unless you know your brother is illiterate - then you really should have warned him.", "NTA and he shouldn't take something that is labeled. That's what he gets for being entitled.", "NTA. Why ignore the literal sign on the juice saying not the drink it??? I'm sure you guys will all be laughing about this in time because it makes such a hilarious story.", "Well if it isn\u2019t the natural consequences of my own actions. Lmao. \n\nI would ensure to have the exact same bottle at every event brother comes to, you know, just in case in future he can\u2019t get to the store.  This will be a fantastic sorry to tell at future family gatherings.\n\nHilariously NTA", "NTA \n\nAs to your title question, the note do not drink IS a warning\u2026\n\n\n>   I guess he thought it was just her juice because she is a new mom and she wanted a special juice all to herself.\n\nOk, why wasn\u2019t that a good enough reason for him not to steal it from her and deprive her of this one joy?", "Rofl NTA he shouldn't be eating or drinking other people's CLEARLY LABELED foodstuffs. Natural consequences.", "NTA", "Nta. Tell Leah psyllium husks helps a lot too, bil wouldn't eat that.", "NTA \n\nThank you for sharing this. I *TOTALLY* needed this belly laugh \ud83d\ude02 \ud83e\udd23 \ud83d\ude02", "NTA", "NTA but your answer to that is \"So you hurting my wife would have been an acceptable consequence but you hurting yourself wasn't?\"", "Hahahaha this is great\n\nNTA not your fault his drunk ass didn\u2019t see the label", "NTA And it's hilarious that he got the shits. Maybe he will learn to respect other people's things.", "Holy shit!  NTA", "NTA I just have the norovirus and the toilet is my best friend, so i find this story especially funny. He got natural  punishment for stealing juice. If it were me, there would have been wifi problems right in the moment he pray sit on the potty. But i'm petty.", "NTA. Thank you for sharing this story. It made my week. \ud83d\ude02", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23nta that\u2019s what he gets", "LOL this is hilarious. NTA.", "NTA classic case of fuck around and find out", "UBERSUPERULTRA NTA  like seriously bro, of course in the fog of vodka. What an interesting brother you have there so did his brain have any neurons that actually lived?", "NTA.  It was labeled do not drink.  He fucked around and found out", "NTA, he drank something that was marked for somebody else", "NTA. it was labeled as your wife's. Don't take things without asking. Make him apologize to your wife", "NTA\n\nTell him you guess he\u2019s not a warrior.\n\nAlso, he was warned, it had a label on it.", "Hahahahaha NTA", "I guess this is the drink around and find out version of the saying. NTA.", "NTA\n\nI hope you were kind, though, and got his dumbass self some Gatorade or Pedialyte...", "NTA. Your brother could have avoided it all if he only *asked!*", "NTA.\n\nYour brother just learned a valuable lesson about taking things that don\u2019t belong to him. At 21 he\u2019s old enough to know better, but spending the day in the bathroom will definitely reinforce that", "NTA it had a label. Also, what adult doesnt know that prune juice makes you shit??", "NTA. And that story is great! One you can tell around the fire. Build up the suspense a little more next time though.", "Your brother is a jerk.", "Lmao dude I had almost this same thing happen when I was on prune juice. Had a buddy use it as much, he ran out of cranberry. He laughed about it later but he was not happy for sure. Definitely NTA who doesn't know what prune juice is", "NTA.", "NTA\nLOL\nSurely he was warned not to steal before now. His ignorance, greed and lack of respect for others landed him in the shit. How he thinks anyone else is to blame is unfathomable. He owes your wife an apology for stealing from her clearly marked container. He owes you an apology for spewing his anger and blame on you for his STEALING from your wife.", "NTA. Karma can be swift.", "NTA - Anytime he brings it up laugh and say he deserves it for stealing your wife's medication.  Also ask him if he missed the label?  Is he illiterate?  Oh, so you knew?  Then it's on you bud.  You could have asked, you stole, you get what you get. \n\nThieves don't get to be mad when what they steal turns around and gives them the trots.\n\nAnd he's a thief stealing from a new mom, so I'd also tell everyone about this and make it into a long running family joke \"Oh, watch out it's BrotherThief!  No juice is safe, and we should make sure any rentals have two bathrooms!  Hahahaha!\"  or \"Don't bother labeling your stuff, BrotherThief will just take it anyway.  Remember when he took wife's medication and had the runs in the bathroom?  It was so funny that he wasn't even sorry about stealing, just sorry it didn't work out well for him.\"\n\nOr just blow raspberries then sing \"when you're sliding into third, and you feel a little turd...BrotherThief's stolen juice diarrhea.\"\n\nOr something that is actually funny but roasts him, too.  So don't apologize as he should be apologizing to you, make HIM into a joke and rub it in.  Maybe between the trots and the teasing maybe he won't steal from the fridge in the future or maybe he'll think twice.  I bet he is that guy at work that steals other people's lunches and he deserves what he got.", "NTA he stole a drink that was two fruit juices and fibre, so not medicine or toxic in any way. Not your fault the stolen drink had that effect on him.", "NTA. Should've bought him a single roll of TP while you were out.", "NTA and lol at your brothers asshole", "Prune juice is disgusting. How did he drink that much of it lol", "NTA this is hilarious. And his own fault for not paying attention.", "Thank you for the laugh. NTA in the least FAFO applies", "Prune Juice.... A warrior's drink!", "NTA\n\nYou should not have to warn a family member not to steal someone else's juice.", "This is my favorite Reddit post ever. Natural consequences. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother is a bit of an idiot when he\u2019s drunk.", "NTA he seems like the type of guy to stick his hand in a cup of coffee labeled caution hot and then get mad when he gets burned", "nta but your brother is both an asshole and an idiot", "If you didn't see him do it, when were you supposed to warn him not to use the bottle with a warning label on it?", "Oh man.  Maybe Worf really drinks prune juice because he's perpetually constipated?!\n\nGuess too much gagh will mess you up...\n\nAlso, \ud83e\udd23  NTA", "NTA. It was clearly labelled and HE chose to ignore that - now he's stewing in his own juices.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like the juice wasn\u2019t labeled. This is well deserved and your brother doesn\u2019t deserve an ounce of sympathy.", "NTA. The juice literally said \u201cdo not drink\u201d, how much clearer of a warning did he need?", "That\u2019s fucking hilarious and he got exactly what he deserved. Even if it was just your wife\u2019s special juice, fuck him for drinking her special juice. NTA.", "Nta and hide the loo roll while you're at it!", "NTA.
