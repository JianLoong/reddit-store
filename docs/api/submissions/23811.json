Your brother meant to inconvenience your wife, not himself. Oops.", "You're very thoughtful.\n\nI would have been laughing too hard to get off the floor - never mind gone to the market.\n\nNTA", "NTA,  \nHe was fine with nicking food from a pregnant woman.  \nHe's only upset that his breach of trust and lack of communication skills (how hard is it to ask to borrow something?) resulted in his own discomfort.", "You would be an asshole not to put a very passive aggressive warning on her juice moving forward.", "This is so funny. That will teach him to drink someone's juice. NTA", "NTA. And this is hilarious.", "I am lmao", "NTA. Your brother needed to learn that his actions have consequences one way or another. This one will hopefully do the trick, plus. This will be one hilarious story down the line", "Best post ever! Lol. It helps sometimes to be able to read.\nNTA\nThat is going to be one of the best \u201aback then\u2018 stories.", "\"My brother drank something that doesn't belong to him despite me putting an obvious warning label on it. Am I the asshole?\"\n\nReally?", "NTA.\n\nAnd if he brings it up again, I would forward him resources to enroll in remedial literacy courses at a local community college or library.", "NTA instant karma for the win!", "Hahahahaha. NTA. Hahahaaa...", "BWAHAHAHAHAHAAA    \n^sorry\n\nNTA", "Karmic justice", "I have no idea what is prune juice, but I have the magical ability of reading. And if something says do not drink I don't drink it. I'm weird like that.

This is hilarious \ud83d\ude02", "Classic FAFO.  Maybe he won\u2019t feel entitled to take people\u2019s stuff in the future.  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f NTA.", "NTA.   \n    \n>  So he is drunk, has the vodka shits and now the natural laxatives have taken effect.   \n   \nExcellent.  But prune juice isn't a miracle.  He mostly has vodka shits.  And wants someone to blame.", "Why does he need a warning label on a container of juice that was clearly labeled DO NOT DRINK? Even if your wife did just want her own juice to herself, if you or her bought it and made it known you didn\u2019t want anyone else to drink it that\u2019s all that matters. He took what wasn\u2019t his to take. This is his karma. NTA.", "NTA. How are you the asshole? He stole your wife's drink, drank it, and had the consequences for his actions. He was drunk, would he even cared about a warning? Obviously he didn't care when it did say it belonged to someone. Maybe he will think twice, next time.", "NTA\n\nHe's TA", "NTA like who drinks personally labeled drinks who isn\u2019t an AH. Honestly the situation is hilarious\ud83d\ude02", "NTA and also the MVP for replacing the stuff so she still has her juice.", "NTA\n\nIf anything he's the asshole for taking it after clearly seeing that it SPECIFICALLY wasn't for other people.\n\nAnd now he's getting his just desserts.", "NTA, he was in the wrong for taking the juice. And now hopefully, he'll never do that again!", "NTA. Tell him he's lucky he didn't down a bottle of breastmilk.", "This post made me laugh out loud. NTA OP. The juice was labeled as belonging to someone (your wife). It doesn't matter if it is a natural laxative she's using or just her favorite. *It was hers and labeled as such.* If bro had asked instead of just assuming she was being a \u2728\ufe0fpost-partum princess\u2728\ufe0f (please understand that label is incredibly sarcastic) he wouldn't have the shits.", "LMAO. That stuff is nasty, must have been terrible mixed with vodka. The only way I'll take it is warm. NTA.", "Seriously though. What is prune juice? I mean prunes are dehydrated plums, meaning they don\u2019t contain juice.", "Brother was an idiot for stealing from a breastfeeding mom. It could have had other things in there to help mom out.\n\nI'd ask him if he wants to flavour his vodka with laxatives or buy include an extra dose of prune juice just for the brother.", "He frankly deserves the exorcism his colon is getting.", "To add to this, one trick I saw when I was doing my clinicals was a cup of water and then warm prune juice mixed with miralax.", "\u201cI thought it was fine as long as SHE was the only one inconvenienced!!\u201d", "This brother\u2019s audacity.

We had to buy prune juice and pear juice for my daughter and water it down for her as a daily drink for awhile and I just had to exert so much self control not not drink the stuff straight.

Jadzia went from a shy introvert to a exuberant extrovert. Verad was a weak pathetic man but once he became Dax he was calm, confident, and more intelligent\u2026 and those two were ready and wanted the symbiont. Ezri didn\u2019t even have any training to be a host."]}
