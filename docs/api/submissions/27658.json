{"id": 27658, "submission_id": "16si5uc", "title": "AITA for not letting my friend come along with me to a Taylor Swift concert?", "selftext": "Okay, this happened about a month ago, but I'm still facing the repercussions. I (F19) and my casual friend (F19) had planned to go to the Eras tour in August. Let's call her Juno. Juno and I are both huge fans and I booked us tickets, which she said she'll pay me for afterwards.\n\nHowever, a week before the concert, I went out for dinner with Juno and her inner circle. This group was the elitist, film studies major kind. They made fun of my background and compared my interests to their superior ones the whole night, and when I brought up that I was working on an unfinished book, they suddenly became experts in literature themselves. They gave me unsolicited advice that had heavy condescending undertones to it. Whenever I asked about their lives, they had a \"you just wouldn't get it\" attitude about it. I was very caught off guard. They straight up called me \"uncultured\" and \"simple minded\" for not knowing some niche terms etc. They were nor laughing *with* me, they were laughing AT me.\n\nTurns out, I was an inside joke to them. I was having a convo with two of the girls there, and they started asking about my \"monetary issues\" and discussing my exes and even their current gfs. Juno had divulged all my secrets to them and gained approval from them in return. I felt exposed, and since they were pretty drunk by that point, they couldn't see that I was uncomfortable.\n\nThey were very invested in my personal life and told me \"Where I was going wrong\". Some things they knew about me were straight up untrue. From there, I also found out that Juno had been trying to make moves on my current partner, and that \"I could lose him too, like I did my exes\". It was all very funny to them.\n\nNeedless to say, I went back home that night and cried. I didn't contact Juno up until the concert, and she didn't bother to do so either since I was always the one initiating our convos. On the day of the concert, I took another friend with me, and posted it on social media. Juno kept calling me the whole day, and since I hadn't sent her the tickets, she couldn't go. \n\nAt the end of the day, I finally picked up her phone and said I was busy so I'd missed her previous calls. Juno was livid. She called me very selfish for stealing her only opportunity to go to the concert she's wanted to for so long. I told her then maybe she she shouldn't have spread rumours about me to her pretentious friend group and then set me up to be humiliated by them. \n\nJuno was crying, and said she would've booked seperate tickets if she knew I was so flaky. She didn't even acknowledge my accusations, and kept whining about the concert. Tbh, I didn't even ditch her to get revenge or whatever, I just wanted to enjoy my day with actually decent people. \n\nFlashforward and Juno still keeps harassing me by DMing my friends and gossiping about how b*tchy I was. I shared this with my boyfriend and he thinks I was too harsh on her, and I should've been the bigger person and given her her own ticket atleast. \n\nSo, aita?", "created_utc": 1695717695, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16si5uc/aita_for_not_letting_my_friend_come_along_with_me/", "score": 199, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I did this because she was spreading rumours about me among her other friend group and brought me infront of them for their entertainment. I feel that I might've gone too far and the girl will not get to experience that concert again because of me.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n###[Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As long as Juno didn't already pay for her ticket you were right in dropping this phony friend.  She seems to take great delight in belittling you to her other friends and sharing your secrets in order to gain some sort of cache with that group.  She learned the meaning of karma.", "Block this toxic girl. And your bf siding with her is sus. Glad you have some actual friends and were able to enjoy the concert.\n\nNTA", "NTA because Juno effed around and found out. Not everyone will just take being a doormat. I would just say however for the future just speak up. If you knew she was wrong and that upset you let her know. A simple call or text to tell her you didn\u2019t appreciate what was going on and that you\u2019d be going to with someone else to the concert would have been the mature response. As of now it might look petty or low to others\u2026which bc you\u2019re here clearly matters to you. Just advocate for yourself in the future, That way your response won\u2019t be able to be cast as petty. Whatever it is still NTA tho", "no assholes here*, just karma.\n\nNTA\n\n*EXCEPT juno ofc.", "NTA for deciding to sell her ticket to someone else after the way she and her friends treated you. \n\nTo be above reproach though, you should have called or texted her with that info immediately after the night out from hell. That would be about you wanting to enjoy the concert with an actual friend. \n\nYou definitely had your toe up to the line, if not fully crossed over it, when you didn't tell her until the day of the show. THAT was about you wanting to hurt her. That's not a good look.\n\nHer transgressions are far worse though, so I'd say she's the AH and you had a catty moment.", "NTA but your bf is. Check if he is already seeing Juno", "\u201cYou\u2019re talking shit for the hell of it. Addicted to betrayal but you\u2019re relevant\u2026\u201d\n\nUm\u2026had you taken this creep with you, she would\u2019ve ruined your concert experience. She is not your friend. She got her karma, aka the consequences of her actions. \n\nAs for your boyfriend\u2026wtf? He\u2019s suggesting that you should\u2019ve ruined your experience so as not to be \u201charsh\u201d?  Should you be a \u201cpathological people pleaser\u201d? Nope. NTA.", "NTA, cut off contact with Juno and the boyfriend. You don\u2019t need the toxicity in your life and people like your boyfriend supporting it.\nAlso, you spent way too much time with Junos friends that night. You should have left as soon as they started being rude too you.", "NTA, although you appear to be swimming in a sea of them.\n\nCongratulations in providing her with an object lesson in why you don't mock your friends with your other friends. It seems she still isn't really aware that what she did was wrong, or maybe she doesn't realize the extent to which you are aware of what she has done.\n\nI find it hysterical that *film* majors feel superior to anyone. Golgafrincham Arc B subjects right here. But then, students of any subject can be AH if they try.\n\nI hope your BF is a decent person and he recognizes (eventually) that minimizing the impact of bullying of *his gf* is not a good look for anybody. I also suggest you get better at AH detection. You seem to have let a free range AH with narcissistic tendencies into your life, it's important to your future happiness that such people are blocked out from the start.", "NTA\n\nUnless and until she paid you, those tickets were both yours.  She crossed a line by talking shit about you to her friend group just to make herself feel good and to fit in, brought you into that scenario and let them act like AHs to you, obvi has said she could take your man if she wanted to, and still expects you to give her a ticket that she prob wouldn\u2019t have ended up paying you for anyway.  I would have blocked her the minute I figured out she was the one that talked shit.  That\u2019s a negative, ghost rider.  Also dump the lame ass BF too.  Toxic breeds toxic and it doesn\u2019t sound like you want that based on your comment about wanting to be with decent ppl.", "NTA - your bf is an idiot !  \n\u2018Be the bigger person\u2019 is a moronic thing to say.  \nIt\u2019s only said to the person who is in the right by someone who wants the one in the wrong to get their way.  \nYou said the \u2018friends\u2019 told you Juno was trying to make moves on him ?  \nMaybe they are working ?", "YTA for wasting everyones time\n\n> I also found out that Juno had been trying to make moves on my current partner,", "Close call between NTA and ESH here. I get your reaction but you're sort of being TA to her because she was a colossal TA to you. Based on this story, I'd rather be friends with you than her, but I'd probably worry what you'd do if you were ever mad at me.", "NTA. You were NOT too harsh on you. She sold you out so she could be one of the \"popular\" girls. It's bull shit. Why would you want to have a memory of that amazing concert be with someone who treated you so badly? You were right to take someone else.", "You'd worry that someone wouldn't want to go to a concert with you after you were a massive AH to them and were making moves on their bf? You should worry if that didn't cross enough lines for you.", "Since OP just avoided her ex-friend, I'd be worried that she'd get mad at me for something I'm not aware of (I wouldn't hit on her boyfriend because, while I appreciate a handsome man, I'm not into them) and then just disappear instead of talking about it. No reason to think that OP only takes revenge when it's justified.", "This isn't \"revenge\", this is self-preservation. When someone is that toxic (as her friend demonstrated she is both before and after the concert) explaining something to them is pointless because they'll just turn it around on you. You're better off just cutting them off.", "NTA- oh nooo the consequences of her own actions! Block her everywhere. And her pretentious friends.", "Nta she was never a friend to you she was just using you and imo probably would have only ever given you excuses to why she cant or shouldn\u2019t pay you back afterwards\n\nIf anything shes just butt hurt that she has been exposed as a fake friend", "NTA, what goes around comes around, this is Karma.\n\nLoyalty & friendship is a 2 way thing, this person was not your friend & showed no loyalty.\n\n  \nThey discussed your \"monetary issues\"....had this girl even paid for the ticket ?", "INFO: did she ever pay you back for her ticket? If not NTA, it was never really hers. If so ESH.", "NTA. Juno\u2019s finding out from her fucking around is entirely Juno\u2019s doing. Your boyfriend is not a good one if he thinks you were too harsh. Especially as her friends said she was making moves on him, that\u2019s something to keep an eye on.", "Juno is not your friend. NTA. Good riddance to bad rubbish\ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf89", "You should've been the bigger person?  Is he for real?  As far as the ticket is concerned, it wasn't hers as she hadn't paid for it yet.  This girl sounds completely toxic & approval seeking.  You don't need this in your life.  NTA.", "Yo why is your boyfriend taking her side?  What the fuck?\n\nNTA.\n\nI'm sorry you had such ruinous bitches in your life.", "NTA. She and your boyfriend suck. She didn't pay for the ticket, so you're in the clear on that end, at least. Block her.", "She turned you I to a joke. She deserves nothing from you. Besides, what you did didn't really hurt her in any real way. Your BF needs to get on your side or GTFO.", "Down voted for yet another Taylor Swift post. Surely there are other scenarios to use?", "Block the girl and I would dump your shitty bf. You deserve better NTA", "NTA. Juno is a major AH and your bf is not winning any prizes either. What the hell is wrong with these people? They sound awful.", "Juno what happens when you fuck around, Juno found out. \n\nNTA", "Nta your bf is a huge a**hole. She's harassing you and gossiping and spreading lies. Her friends all humiliated you and talk about trying to take your bf from you. \n\nYet your bf thinks you should have been the bigger person? Um no. He's behavior is awful and very sus. You have no idea if she actually already did something or not with him but based on what he said to you. He definitely is an a**hole and should have had your back.\n\nYou had every right to not go with her to that concert. Those tickets were yours. She never paid you for her ticket.  What made her think you would still want to go with her to the concert while making fun of you and never paying for her ticket. \n\nYou were not harsh on Juno. Those tickets were yours. You paid for them. Juno never paid you.", "NTA. Your ex friend just got a great lesson in karma. Why is your bf defending someone who broke your trust and tried to humiliate you though?! You might want to consider dropping him as well..", "Nta. But stop calling her your friend. She never was. She's a bully.\nDon't worry about her", "NTA, I was teached to be the \"bigger person\" but honestly that just turns you into a doormat. Lose the \"friend\". Friends don't spread rumors or try to steal each other's partners.", "NTA - bf is showing a red flag as well!", "NTA  You couldn't have given Juno her ticket because she didn't have a ticket. You had two tickets to use as you saw fit.", "NTA - Seems Karma was your tickets to a show with a real friend", "NTA. Seriously, girl, fuck all these aholes (maybe not the person you went to the concert with!) Please dump your bf and block the lot of them, you'll be better off without them.", "NTA Let your mutual friends know how she is behaving and say you didn't do it to get back at her, but that wouldn't have been a bad idea either. Put BF on probation.", "NTA. Juno is trouble. You're lucky you didn't take her; she was never paying you back. Never front money for others. Make them pay when you get the tickets.\n\nBring the bigger person just means being the doormat because you're easier to deal with than the other one.\n\nDump your bf.", "NTA and your boyfriend either doesn't understand the situation fully or he needs to get gone because NOPE", "NTA. She's lucky you didn't do worse. She effed around and found out.\n\nAnd let your boyfriend turn to her; she wants him, and they're each a booby prize.", "My thoughts exactly!\n\nNTA but boyfriend is borderline", "Bf is also toxic. Juno deserved every word and much more. NTA.", "Juno has definitely turned him", "She hadn't heard from Juno in the weeks prior to the concert and since the hell night. Juno is not her friend if they hadn't been talking at all for weeks and then suddenly the day of the concert and lo and behold Juno's calling....the heck with that girl. She got karma-ed", "While I agree in principle it would\u2019ve been better to tell her ahead of time, in this instance I don\u2019t think that would\u2019ve been the right call. It would have been a week of non-stop harassment from Juno and co based on what\u2019s happened since.", "I give the boyfriend a 12/10 AH score. Opie, DUMP. THAT. TRAITOR\n\nDitch that toxic person too", "Yeah, I fully support OPs actions. In boyfriend's shoes, I would have said that I'd only have given Juno the ticket for 2x or more what OP paid for it. Because fuck Juno and her friends, but profiteering off of her after all the shitty money problems, before blocking Juno, would have been some justice. And if she balked, give her the old \"well, I have money problems and *clearly* you don't, so you should *easily* be able to afford this.\"\n\nBF is suspect and may be secretly receptive to Juno's advances.", "BF has a crush on Juno - that's why he'd stand up for Juno over his actual girlfriend.", "I think you are on the money .If Juno had contacted OP before the day of that concert OP would have been the better person to let her know .OP is still NTA because she waited \u2014but why get close to the trough the pigs feed in ?", "The consequences of her own actions! Block her everywhere. And her pretentious friends,", "He might have just liked the attention.  He absolutely knew Juno was putting moves on him and liked feeling wanted.  Never bothered to tell his gf Junk was being inappropriate.", "Not wanting to spend time with someone that has been vile isn\u2019t \u201crevenge\u201d. It\u2019s basic common sense."]}
