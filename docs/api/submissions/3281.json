Now that I\u2019m older and fairly successful there are a lot of things I \u201cqualify\u201d for but never pursue because I don\u2019t  feel good about taking something I don\u2019t  actually need. \n* The argument that it\u2019s merit based, therefore it\u2019s fair, is a bad argument. Children from more well-off families have the type of resources and support children from lower-incomes don\u2019t have access to, so would it be surprising if they had more merits? Not really. Example: while most of my peers\u2019 parents were educated and could help them with their homework, my mom (who has a 2nd grade education)  was sitting next to me and asking if I could teach her and if she could try my homework. Whereas alot of me peers could afford extracurriculars (both sports and academic extracurricular activities) I was going with my mom to her work (she was a janitor) and helping her clean commercial buildings after school so she wasn\u2019t up late working.  Im not shocked that my peers had more \u201cmerits\u201d than me. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nIn short, I\u2019m more of a believer in equity whereas it seems like the school distributed the scholarship based off an \u201cequal opportunity\u201d assessment when the only thing equal about it is the equal ability to apply but not an actual fair assessment of merit and you took advantage of the opportunity when you didn\u2019t need it", "These sound like academic and extracurricular based scholarships not financial ones.

Parents are less stressed because they are more financially secure. There isn\u2019t food, housing, or clothing insecurity. Well off parents go to better public schools because they usually live in nicer areas. Well off parents can afford tutors and after school programs. \n\nI teach in an urban school. Many of my students parents barely graduated high school, work 2 jobs, often work 2nd/3rd shift making being involved difficult, or commute to nearby cities making their commute 2-3 hours a day. Due to hosing insecurity my students frequently move, resulting in gaps in education. \n\nSo while my students may be able to get a scholarship, let\u2019s not pretend that they had the same opportunity as someone in one of the nearby affluent school districts. This \u201cbootstraps\u201d bullshit does no one favors.", "Scholarships are given for different reasons.  There are academic scholarships that schools give to attract academically  high performing students regardless of need.   Scholarships  are offered by some schools to gifted, hard working athletes, regardless of financial need.    Some scholarships are based on the  financial needs of the students of their families.  Private schools have the right to give places in their schools as they see fit.  Many   years ago I applied to St Louis University and Washington University.  I was offered a half tuition scholarship to SLU, but nothing to Washington U.  I asked for a meeting with the administrator in charge of financial aid at Washington U to ask why the more expensive school had not offered me any money.  The administrator told me that they were trying to get students from other parts of the country to attend the school and were not interested in reducing tuition to local students . Had I been a high school senior from New York or LA or New Orleans  I would have gotten financial assistance.  Unless the parents lied about their financial assets   to get a break on the costs, they did not take the place of a disadvantaged student with equal academic abilities.  kt", "As an underprivileged kid that made it.

Should be the top comment.", "Not all private schools are for-profit, and I imagine that most for-profit private schools don't offer many scholarships. (especially to kids of parents who can pay for tuition) But, a non-profit school still needs money to function, and to do that, it helps to have a reputation as a good school. The unpleasant truth that most people don't like to acknowledge is that a school is only as good as its students. You want to have a good school, you need to bring in good students.", "In the early 90s where I worked, 100s were working over 70 hrs a week for over a yr. I asked some of them why do you work so much OT.  We make good money, and you have no time to use it. They replied that it was a way to make more money and why not.  I said you'd get more time with your family but more importantly if enough people turned it down, then GM would hire more people and then your kids could get hired on and they could build a future for their families. Well as I talked to more people eventually GM started hiring many more people at our plant. Probably not all of tot their kids in but they were satisfied that if not theirs's at least other people's kids got jobs. \n\nThis is hardly a parallel but there is a good feeling for many to spread the wealth so others can get a leg up.", "If you cannot raise children. do not have them.  kt", "Ur kids have an amazing mom.

My kids have gone through a lot and I am so incredibly proud of them!", "If the lower income person has children and does not have time for them,  they run the  very high risk of raising children that will not be academically successful, which will limit their opportunities as they mature.  I was a teacher for over 30 years.  there is no substitute for an involved parent. My mom started working outside the home as soon as my younger brother started kindergarten. She was still involved in our scholastic endeavors as she  helped start a Great Books Reading club at our grade school where students and interested adults read s specific book a month then we gathered in small groups under adult guidance to discuss the books.  kt", "NTA. Merit based scholarships exists too.", "I agree with everyone you are definitely NTA because your kids did the work and it appears merit based. So kudos to them.  And life just happens that way usually when you have money it's easier to save money.  You will have money for other elements of your child's education.   What I don't necessarily agree with is everyome saying it's merit based if it was need based then the low income kids would go for that.  However there are plenty of low income kids who ARE talented and could match on a merit level.  BUT IF they go to a lower level public school there merit might not be considered equal.  The school might not feel that would be the talent to attract not recognizing that this low income child is not challenged by their current school.  \n\nIf this is really concerning you, maybe you could find a way to reach out to lower income schools about scholarships.  I don't believe that just because your low income your not as talented.  As stated in other comments if their parents are working multiple jobs they may not have the time or capacity to know about scholarships. Or even the knowledge themselves.  I am sure with your resources you're childs natural talent was cultivated.  Unfortunately lots a low income kids are ONLY directed to need based and sports scholarships not recognizing their merit capabilitiea. Because people in scholarship positions don't recognize them on merit competing levels, i.e their school is not as challenging.

Plenty of athletes/ musicians/ generally gifted people who get full rides for their abilities regardless of socioeconomic status. You can't have it both ways.
