Now that I\u2019m older and fairly successful there are a lot of things I \u201cqualify\u201d for but never pursue because I don\u2019t  feel good about taking something I don\u2019t  actually need. \n* The argument that it\u2019s merit based, therefore it\u2019s fair, is a bad argument. Children from more well-off families have the type of resources and support children from lower-incomes don\u2019t have access to, so would it be surprising if they had more merits? Not really. Example: while most of my peers\u2019 parents were educated and could help them with their homework, my mom (who has a 2nd grade education)  was sitting next to me and asking if I could teach her and if she could try my homework. Whereas alot of me peers could afford extracurriculars (both sports and academic extracurricular activities) I was going with my mom to her work (she was a janitor) and helping her clean commercial buildings after school so she wasn\u2019t up late working.  Im not shocked that my peers had more \u201cmerits\u201d than me. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nIn short, I\u2019m more of a believer in equity whereas it seems like the school distributed the scholarship based off an \u201cequal opportunity\u201d assessment when the only thing equal about it is the equal ability to apply but not an actual fair assessment of merit and you took advantage of the opportunity when you didn\u2019t need it", "These sound like academic and extracurricular based scholarships not financial ones.
