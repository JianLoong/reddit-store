The reason\u2019s vary such as there\u2019s too many people and not enough space, guests at birthday\u2019s shower\u2019s, etc. have a fear of large dogs, and the most recent for my cousins wedding that she doesn\u2019t want a large dog there to cause her stress that he might do something.\n\nFor context, my sister is diagnosed with PTSD, generalized anxiety with major depressive episodes. Her service dog just got his official certification in January 2023, and has been in training since 2020 up until that time. He wouldn\u2019t ever be \u201cworking\u201d around the family since it was believed he didn\u2019t need to and could be free to run and play with the other dogs. Now, even with the compromise of having him wear his vest for working, the family is unwilling to compromise. They say since she isn\u2019t anxious around the family there\u2019s no need for him there, so she can go a few hours without the dog. They justify this by arguing she went to Japan for 16 days without him, even though they don\u2019t realize the the effort she and her husband went through to try and make it work but couldn\u2019t without jeopardizing the dogs life.\n\nAny insight on this would be helpful. Thx\n\nEdit: Zeus is a Certified Service Dog for PTSD and anxiety. Not an ESA. He has undergone all the training and qualifications and is registered through government. My sister qualified on account of her physical conditions related to her diagnosis. Zeus alerts to panic attacks, migraines and fainting spells while also offering aid when needed like deep pressure.\n\nHaving a service dog is described to our family as similar to having a prosthetic in that functioning without it is possible, however life becomes more challenging. With her service dog, her quality of life improves and her health is monitored around the clock.\n\nWe as a unit, we agree that our cousin can ask for whatever she wants at her wedding and respect it. However the decision falls with my sister and she has not felt welcome in the family for all the other events she\u2019s been asked not to bring her service dog.", "created_utc": 1688146054, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14n6llb/aita_for_not_attending_my_cousins_wedding_and/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can see both sides but I do sense some potentially assholish behavior from that side of the family.

Service dogs laws differ from country to country, in Japans case they only recognize guide, mobility and hearing service dogs. They don\u2019t recognize service dogs for anything else, not even seizures. And even if you have a service dog for the disabilities recognized for such in Japan, if it doesn\u2019t meet the rest of requirements like being certified with Assistance Dogs International then you still won\u2019t be protected.

When I visit family I allow my SD to be mostly off duty if the situation allows for such.

In the US, other countries are different obviously. \n\nMore info here: [https://www.ada.gov/resources/service-animals-faqs/](https://www.ada.gov/resources/service-animals-faqs/) The bits about certification/registration go from questions 17 to 21, with 17 being the one most relevant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  \nQ17. Does the ADA require that service animals be certified as service animals?  \nA. No.  Covered entities may not require documentation, such as proof that the animal has been certified, trained, or licensed as a service animal, as a condition for entry.  \nThere are individuals and organizations that sell service animal certification or registration documents online. These documents do not convey any rights under the ADA and the Department of Justice does not recognize them as proof that the dog is a service animal.", "Hes talking about the government certification for service dogs.", "Sure, but it makes OP okay to go without it for a few hours at family events.", "Thank you.", "Definitely ableist, but also has me wondering if the bride thinks Zeus will get more attention than her and she doesn\u2019t want to be \u2018upstaged\u2019 by a dog.", "Thanks for your support. Yes, she tried everything to get him to go.", "Thank you.", "Eh disagree.  To me it\u2019s a huge red flag to go to Japan and have no issues for 16 days when the dog is supposedly that important.", "I don\u2019t expect a dog to have the capacity to understand how social situations work the way a human would.", "Then he would be working.", "It is an official accredited certification that took three years of training to complete. My sister was not scammed. It's legit.", ">  He wouldn\u2019t ever be \u201cworking\u201d around the family since it was believed he didn\u2019t need to and could be free to run and play with the other dogs. \n\nDid I misunderstand this?", "But for someone to be so willing to leave a service animal and go to a foreign country for 2 weeks purely for recreation to then imply that they *NEED* to be accommodated for a few hours in an environment where they are verifiably safe and have done fine before? That\u2019s just too much. You still make very valid points. But I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t agree with the simple fact that someone who can go without *by choice* for two weeks can then turn around and demand accommodation for a few hours. Those simply both can\u2019t be true.", "To imply that she is fine to take 16 days in a foreign country without her \u201cservice dog\u201d but absolutely cannot be without it for a few hours with family is just crazy.", "You're *assuming* she had no issues. Just because OP's relative didn't say she had a panic attack doesn't mean one didn't happen. That is medical information that no one is entitled to and the relative doesn't have to reveal medical history during a trip (business, leisure or otherwise) for the people around them (who supposedly care about them) to make a judgment and allow medical equipment.", "A blind person goes somewhere where he can\u2019t bring his dog, and uses his cane.  He can get around, but using the cane severely increases the risk he gets hurt and limits his range.  Nevertheless, depending on the circumstances, he might make that choice.  But if you point to that to say \u201coh look, he doesn\u2019t need the dog,\u201d you\u2019re an AH.  Does that make sense?", "On a technically sure, you could consider it that way and even argue that service dogs never stop working. \n\nHowever, when someone normally describes a service dog as working they\u2019re usually meaning the dog is in a heel or close by the handler at all times, not interacting with anyone, completely focused on their handler and nothing else, etc. And when they say the dog isn\u2019t working or is off duty, they usually mean that even though the dog will still task it is being allowed to relax and act like any other well behaved dog.\n\nWhat those terms mean is important to understand.", "No where has OP said that their sister was completely fine during those 16 days though. Did she go to Japan for 16 days without her service dog? Yes, but that doesn\u2019t mean she was fine during the trip. \n\nIt\u2019s very likely she probably had situations in which she had to use less effective or different aids or coping mechanisms to get through the trip. She shouldn\u2019t be forced to do the same in her home country though where her service dog is protected and can provide more effective mitigation of her disability. Even if the wedding is only a few hours.", "If they need to be available to do their duties they they can\u2019t be treated like a regular pet. Normal pets can be locked out of the room or kept separately but from what is being described that shouldn\u2019t happen with this dog. Even if they\u2019re not actively working all of the time, they need to be available to work all of the time so accommodations still need to be made. \n\nIt is disingenuous to try to say that you can treat a service animal like a regular pet AND also have the accommodations needed by a service dog at the same time. It\u2019s a service dog and should be treated as such."]}
