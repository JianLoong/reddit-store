{"id": 20998, "submission_id": "14n6llb", "title": "AITA for not attending my cousin\u2019s wedding and other family events over a service dog?", "selftext": "My younger sister has a service dog, and since Christmas our mother\u2019s family (whom we\u2019ve spent most family gatherings with since we were born) has asked that she leave her service dog at home on every occasion. The reason\u2019s vary such as there\u2019s too many people and not enough space, guests at birthday\u2019s shower\u2019s, etc. have a fear of large dogs, and the most recent for my cousins wedding that she doesn\u2019t want a large dog there to cause her stress that he might do something.\n\nFor context, my sister is diagnosed with PTSD, generalized anxiety with major depressive episodes. Her service dog just got his official certification in January 2023, and has been in training since 2020 up until that time. He wouldn\u2019t ever be \u201cworking\u201d around the family since it was believed he didn\u2019t need to and could be free to run and play with the other dogs. Now, even with the compromise of having him wear his vest for working, the family is unwilling to compromise. They say since she isn\u2019t anxious around the family there\u2019s no need for him there, so she can go a few hours without the dog. They justify this by arguing she went to Japan for 16 days without him, even though they don\u2019t realize the the effort she and her husband went through to try and make it work but couldn\u2019t without jeopardizing the dogs life.\n\nAny insight on this would be helpful. Thx\n\nEdit: Her dog is a Certified Service Dog for PTSD and anxiety. Not an ESA. He has undergone all the training and qualifications and is registered through government. My sister qualified on account of her physical conditions related to her diagnosis. Her service dog alerts to panic attacks, migraines and fainting spells while also offering aid when needed like deep pressure.\n\nHaving a service dog is described to our family as similar to having a prosthetic in that functioning without it is possible, however life becomes more challenging. With her service dog, her quality of life improves and her health is monitored around the clock.\n\nWe as a unit, we agree that our cousin can ask for whatever she wants at her wedding and respect it. However the decision falls with my sister and she has not felt welcome in the family for all the other events she\u2019s been asked not to bring her service dog.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks everyone for all your insights. I can see this is an uphill battle, with a fixation on the wedding itself, which makes sense... I put it in the title. It's the repeated exclusions from family events that is the real issue. I think both parties (my sister and her service dog versus my uncle and cousin) need to compromise. My sister has abided by their requests by not coming with the service dog to family events and feels excluded. They have made zero attempts to compromise or accommodate her needs. I'm struggling to understand why someone's convenience is more important than another's right to safety and security. Should someone in a wheelchair not be allowed to attend a family event if the homeowner doesn't want wheel marks on their carpet? I understand it's their right to ask to leave the wheelchair at home. They can still survive without it. But does that make it morally right?\n\nI've learned it's best to leave it to the situation. My cousin can request whatever and whoever she wants at her wedding. I've always respected that. If I should go or not go is still up in the air.\n\nSidenote: Her dog is accredited through the ADI.\n\nEdit 3: She went to Japan as a birthday gift from her husband.

Not diminishing ether one, just most people use the term interchangeably.", "I'm not voting because the situation is unclear. I've read the comments and there's still no explanation as to why your sister could be without the dog for 16 days in Japan but not a few hours at a wedding. \nAlso, by your own statements, at family events the dog wouldn't be \"working\" but being a pet so not sure why she would bring him. Are the other family dogs at the wedding? \nEither way, I don't see why you shouldn't go to the wedding even if your sister decides she doesn't want to go.", "I was under the impression that a service dog was for medical conditions in which the dog had to be with the person at ALL times.

I can see both sides but I do sense some potentially assholish behavior from that side of the family. As in, I don't think it's totally fair of them to question your sisters need for a service dog overall. But because she can go 2+ weeks without the dog in a foreign country, and the dog used to to run around like a pet and if someone is afraid of dogs, I can sort of understand why they would request no dogs. But I would never request that.. I would want my family members at my wedding and comfortable.\n\nIn the end, if your sister is not able or comfortable going without her service dog neither you or her are assholes for declining. It's perfectly reasonable.", "NAH. Your sister wants her dog, I get that. He's very helpful to her. But if she can go to Japan for 16 days without him, I understand why your family may think the dog is not absolutely necessary for her health and comfort, and are therefore weighing her degree of health and comfort against other issues -- such as other family members' fear of large dogs or the bride's comfort at her own wedding.", "I thought people couldn\u2019t function at all without their service dogs and that\u2019s why they have to be allowed to bring them everywhere?

If truly she does not need the dog around family and truly the dog would actually cause stress/phobia in others, its hard for me to see them as AH for asking her to not bring dog on this day.

If this is the framework I'm given, this is how I vote.\n\nHow do you balance a situation of one persons mental health v. the other?

You certainly keep saying the right buzz words and key terms that usually protect true service animals and it sounds like they\u2019ve even gone through some training. But your sister is so very clearly not in as desperate need of this dog by her at family functions as you are trying to describe. I mean shit you admit that the dog comes to just play with the other dogs and for 3 whole years was just a regular ass dog at every family function. You really think a special piece of paper and a fucking vest are going to make people see this dog differently?

Service dogs laws differ from country to country, in Japans case they only recognize guide, mobility and hearing service dogs. They don\u2019t recognize service dogs for anything else, not even seizures. And even if you have a service dog for the disabilities recognized for such in Japan, if it doesn\u2019t meet the rest of requirements like being certified with Assistance Dogs International then you still won\u2019t be protected.

However, just because they could manage a few days without the wheelchair doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t actually need it. It\u2019s still an important mobility aid for them to mitigate their disability. \n\nAlso, as someone who has a service dog, it\u2019s not uncommon at all for service dogs to be semi-off duty in a home or family environment if allowed to be. When I visit family I allow my SD to be mostly off duty if the situation allows for such.

Then vest up and back in, and on duty.  Just do it, even if she doesn\u2019t strictly need it, it will likely be easier to manage family. Teach the kids , praise them for following rules.  Stress to them how it makes rhe dog\u2019s job more work, seder, when the rules aren\u2019t followed.  The kids will totally be on the dog\u2019s side.
