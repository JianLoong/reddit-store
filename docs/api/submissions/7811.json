His girlfriend is black and a very nice, kind and beautiful young lady. I have met her and invited her for dinner and family events plenty of times and she\u2019s a joy to be around. But recently my mother has been staying with us because she  is recovering from a surgery she had and she\u2019s going on 70 years old so she can\u2019t do much on her own. Long story short my mother is a classic racist and being a raging narcissist and she is not one to hold back from her opinions. I showed her a photo of my son and his girlfriend and she went on a 2 hour rant about bloodlines and kept saying they \u201cdon\u2019t look right\u201d and when I said she was coming to dinner she said doesn\u2019t want the girl near her because it\u2019ll \u201cdisturb her\u201d so last minute I told her she could not come. My son has been trying to invite his girlfriend over everyday since but I said no multiple times due to his grandmother being here and her saying she doesn\u2019t want her near her, I just don\u2019t want any problems. But he argues that I am being \u201ca complacent racist\u201d by even allowing her to be here. And even more so for not allowing her to come over to \u201cprotect a racist\u201d. He says I should of told her to leave the moment my mother said all that stuff. But my mother is an elderly woman who can hardly make it on her own as it is. Definitely much harder after surgery. Though I don\u2019t agree with her I can just leave her to fend for herself. I literally do not know what to do. My wife says my son is right about me being complacent but of course she\u2019d agree because her and my mother don\u2019t get along well. I know I am not a damned racist. But now everyone is saying I am aiding one by taking my mothers side.

You should inform your son's girlfriend about the situation and maybe even her parents. If they would be happy with a situation such as grandmother stays in her room, then that's an option.

They ( your son and wife) need to understand your point of view of keeping the peace and avoiding unnecessary unpleansatry. \nI say your son and wife are being the asshole for calling you racist after you have supported your family and taking care of your mother even when you don't agree with her point of view.", "Dude. If my mom was like this, absolutely no fucking way would she have stayed in my house after she started that rant. YTA", "YTA. And you know it.", "You allowed her to go on a two hour rant about bloodlines? Why? There is no world where I would listen to my mother spewing that crap and not call her out for being racist and walk away completely if she still kept going. I would honestly have cut contact with my mother a LONG time ago if I knew she was openly racist like that. I would also tell her that she is under your care as a courtesy, but you won\u2019t allow this talk/behavior in your home and she would have to find other arrangements if this is how she acts. That you won\u2019t allow her hate to negatively impact your son in his own home. But that\u2019s what you allowed. You\u2019re TA. \n\nTo be clear, allowing racism to exist around you like that is racist to some degree. Not being racist isn\u2019t good enough, especially around people as ignorant and hateful as your mother. You need to be anti-racist.

You were NOT racist dude.\n\nFirst of all, if I was in your position, I would NOT want to subject my son's girlfriend to my mother's racism. This isn't about protecting the grandmother to me - it's about protecting a young black woman from being around a 70 year-old woman who's simmering with vitriolic racism.\n\nSecond, as someone who's recovering from a surgery myself right now - *post-surgery would be the worst time to have any kind of discussion with your mom about how you want her to behave around your son and his girlfriend*. The best rational people become irrational while recovering from surgery. Trust me, while this 70 year-old is recovering from surgery is NOT the time to risk an ugly and confrontational dinner. For now, consider having the dinner out with your son and his girlfriend if your mom is able to be alone for a few hours, or if someone else is able to stay with her for the duration of a dinner out.\n\nThird, once your mom has recovered from her surgery and is living in her own space again, then have the conversation with her about how she absolutely is not permitted to be rude/racist to your son's girlfriend. And that if she cannot abide by that rule, then she will not be included in anything having to do with your son and his girlfriend.\n\nAnd finally, as your mom gets even older and the possibility of dementia/Alzheimer's/etc. increase, prepare your son and his girlfriend for the reality that they might not be able to see your mom because she'll say unhinged things - and that she's your mom and so you also can't just abandon her.\n\n(Not that this should matter - but I'm a brown guy who's definitely experienced his share of racism.)", "NTA. I\u2019m a POC and I\u2019m sympathetic to your situation. I know this is Reddit so you\u2019ll likely be told you\u2019re an asshole for not casting your racist narc mother onto the street but it\u2019s your mom and she just had surgery. Presumably, she has nowhere else to go. She\u2019s in a vulnerable state and it would be wrong to throw her out at this time. At your core, I can see that you\u2019re trying to balance caring for your mom with protecting your son\u2019s girlfriend from your mother\u2019s views \u2014 does your son really think it\u2019s a good idea for his girlfriend to visit and risk being on the receiving end of racist abuse? Because I don\u2019t. \n\nThat said, there are some things that you should/need to do in order to preserve your relationship with your son and move further from the \u201ccomplacency\u201d you\u2019re being accused of:\n\n1. If you don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe for her to come in, you need to take your son and your girlfriend out. Show them that you support their relationship. Honestly, depending on how close you are with her, consider also extending a delicate explanation accompanied with an apology to the girlfriend. Make it clear that you respect her and think she\u2019s a terrific match with your son but you\u2019re concerned about her wellbeing if she comes over right now because your mom has toxic views. Explain that your mom\u2019s opinions do not extend to the rest of your family and you\u2019re ashamed of the situation but you don\u2019t think it\u2019s emotionally safe for her to visit right now, and that you\u2019re sorry. \n\n2. Set some ground rules with your mom. Make it clear that it\u2019s your house and her views do not align with your beliefs or your family\u2019s values. Say it over and over again. When she\u2019s recovered and moved out, have a separate conversation about how her racism created a toxic environment for your family and you need to step back from her. It\u2019s hard to permanently sever familial ties but once she\u2019s back on her feet, you need to make it clear that your family comes first and if she can\u2019t change her ways, she won\u2019t be allowed back in.", "You're in a tough bind here. You're trying to be good to everyone and nobody is being good to you. The hard thing about racism is that once it shows its ugly head, all rational thought goes out the window. Racism causes people to feel, not think. Read all these messages. How many thoughtful, rational comments have you seen versus those full of emotion? People saying 70 isn't old even though it's ~90% of the life expectancy of a female. Not a single person seems to realize that your intention is to protect the gf from the racist. That's not racist. But the problem with that is that it's allowing your racist mother to win. It's an unintentional side effect, but a nasty one. \n\nQuestions that need to be asked:\nIs your mom not in a bedroom that's separate from the main living areas? \nWhen your mother went on a \"2 hour tirade\" did you attempt to shut her up?\nDid you stick up for your son and his girlfriend at all during said tirade?\n\nThe answers to those questions will point you in the direction of whether or not you're guilty of the accusations against you. \n\nRemember that racism is about feeling, not rational thought. While rationally you were protecting your son's girlfriend, she's going to feel as if some part of you doesn't like her because she's black. Otherwise, why can't she come over? Why is it okay for the white supremacist but not the loving black girl to come over? Must be because he agrees with the racist.  How is it that such a caring son was raised by a racist? Do you see how easy it spirals? \n\nSo I'm going to say ESH. I don't believe you were being an AH, but you're not being too good even if you're trying to be. Your mom is definitely an AH. And your son is a fucking hero. You raised him so some of that spirit must be in you. Use it on your mother.
