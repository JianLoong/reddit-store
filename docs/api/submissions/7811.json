His girlfriend is black and a very nice, kind and beautiful young lady. I have met her and invited her for dinner and family events plenty of times and she\u2019s a joy to be around. But recently my mother has been staying with us because she  is recovering from a surgery she had and she\u2019s going on 70 years old so she can\u2019t do much on her own. Long story short my mother is a classic racist and being a raging narcissist and she is not one to hold back from her opinions. I showed her a photo of my son and his girlfriend and she went on a 2 hour rant about bloodlines and kept saying they \u201cdon\u2019t look right\u201d and when I said she was coming to dinner she said doesn\u2019t want the girl near her because it\u2019ll \u201cdisturb her\u201d so last minute I told her she could not come. My son has been trying to invite his girlfriend over everyday since but I said no multiple times due to his grandmother being here and her saying she doesn\u2019t want her near her, I just don\u2019t want any problems. But he argues that I am being \u201ca complacent racist\u201d by even allowing her to be here. And even more so for not allowing her to come over to \u201cprotect a racist\u201d. He says I should of told her to leave the moment my mother said all that stuff. But my mother is an elderly woman who can hardly make it on her own as it is. Definitely much harder after surgery. Though I don\u2019t agree with her I can just leave her to fend for herself. I literally do not know what to do. My wife says my son is right about me being complacent but of course she\u2019d agree because her and my mother don\u2019t get along well. I know I am not a damned racist. But now everyone is saying I am aiding one by taking my mothers side.
