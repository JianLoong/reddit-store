We would say hi and chat and they always got our son something for his birthday.\n\nThings kind of went south about two years ago.

So now we have what looks like a new, contemporary home next to their home which now looks worse than it did by comparison.\n\nI think this bothered them. Before the remodel, they would come out and say hi just about every time they saw us. After the remodel, the only time we spoke was when they happened to be coming or going at the same time.

This would have been SO MUCH WORK. A completely implausible amount of work.\n\nOP, are you seriously trying to claim that you sat down and spent hours of your life very carefully and laboriously cutting some combination of ~50 words or ~200 letters out of your wife's magazines, ruining the expensive magazines in the process, and then painstakingly, slowly, carefully glued every single one of those 50-200 easily ripped, easily smeared, easily lost teeny tiny scraps of paper onto another page to spell out that giant letter of DOZENS of words or HUNDREDS of characters?\n\nIf you actually did this incredibly stupid and unlikely and almost certainly made-up thing instead of just giving your neighbor his trash can back, then yes.

I feel we get along, but their son ( he doesn\u2019t live with them) angrily asked me if I had taken their garbage can. Similar situation where they\u2019re assigned by the city and look identical, I accidentally took theirs instead of mine. Unsure why this upsets anyone?", "NTA, it was a joke.  He's a shitty neighbor if a house remodel bothers him, like...mind your own business?", "NTA that's really funny and he needs to lighten up, it was clearly a mistake to mix the trash cans up", "YTA. Old people don\u2019t like humor.", "NTA - joke didn\u2019t land. Big deal.", "NTA I thought that was very funny too. Too bad he didn't the humor in it. At least you kept yours.", "NTA.

The note had me cackling, and I would love if I had a neighbor like you regardless of what remodeling you did on the house, but you know the guy is not the nicest and you antagonized him.

Trash bins get accidentally swapped all the time. The amount of people who have the original bin assigned to their house is probably closer to 0% than 100%. The joke was funny, if I was your neighbour I would've laughed and continued it on but I'm not your neighbour. You don't have a jokey, friendly relationship with your neighbour so I can understand that he didn't find it funny or appropriate. There are a lot of older people, especially those part of the 'silent generation' who don't find this type of humour funny and who just wanna follow the rules to a T, even to the point of wanting 'their' trash bin back as that's the 'rule'. All you can do is apologise and continue to be friendly.", "YTA. Basically because you acknowledged that you knew he didn't like you guys after your remodel. Not saying it's justified. But you were aware of it. So why did you think that you were buddy buddy enough to make a ransom note joke, especially after his tense note? And then surprised that he's even more annoyed?", "Yta\n\nYou don't have a good joking relationship. He wanted what was his back, and you made a mockery of his reasonable request. Not cool.", "N (intentionally) TA.\n\nYou didn't mix up the trans cans, it wasn't your fault. His note was rude. Yours was meant to be funny but he didn't appreciate the joke.", "YTA. It was a misguided response when you already knew the relationship had cooled and that he didn't seem to have a sense of humor about the cart. If the relationship has soured for the reasons you suggest, your neighbors are not treating you very well, but it would have been far better for you to just solve the issue rather than go this direction.", "Yta my dude, although I find it hilarious I wouldn't send that note to a neighbor that I already wasn't on great terms with.  Maybe not a fully fledged ahole, but def a face palm moment.", "YTA\n\nthe ransom note was funny but you took his cart. he clearly cared about it and instead of returning it, you gave him a funny note which seemed to imply he had to meet you at midnight to get the cart back?\n\nsome people just dont want to deal with that, like, you clearly aren't close enough to him to pull the situation out like that. he's not your uncle or something or your buddy where the note would be appreciated in good humor.", "YTA\n\nYou had me in your corner until the fake ransom note.  Took it to a level it didn't need to go.  You could have had the high ground on this and you ceded it to make a joke.  I would have used this as an opportunity to approach your neighbor with a trash cart in good condition and ask why he thought you wouldn't return it in good condition? Maybe something happened during construction you didn't know or weren't aware of that he's harboring feelings about.  Just my guess.", "This is weird and you had no reason to think he\u2019d like your weird joke. YTA", "ESH, but this is one of those cases where you're 100% justified in being an asshole. I likely would've done same thing in such a petty situation:D", "ESH - he might have found more humor in the note had you previously returned the trash can. I agree it's pretty funny and harmless, but it doesn't sound like your relationship was in a place to support humor, and now it's probably even further away from that place. I'd want to be moving closer to the old  neighborly relationship you had, but you seem to be moving towards a cameras on the exterior of your house type relationship.", "NTA\n\n\u201cSorry for the mixup. I know you\u2019ve been missing your trash can. It really brings together the look of your property.\u201d\n\nBut for real, that person seems like a piece of work.", "YTA and I doubt the reason for their change of heart was the remodel.", "Damn man, I just snotted from laughter. That is hilarious. Im going with NTA here and I wish we were neighbors. Good luck", "NTA \n\nHe had it coming lol", "I'd have found that hilarious, NTA.  If he had a sense of humor it could have broken the ice and brought back the pleasant contact you had before.", "LMAO! that was good! So they are identical and neither of you paid for yours? was his somehow in better condition or cleaner? NTA, hes being a grouch.", "NTA I laughed.", "Maybe NTA, but kinda immature? Just return the trash can. Also OP has too much time appears to have too much time on their hands. Maybe stop by for a friendly chat instead of playing ransoms note games.", "INFO: Did you ask your wife before cutting up her magazines? If not, you would be kinda TA to your wife for that. \n\nOtherwise, you're NTA for the situation at hand.

Like I said, we used to talk almost daily. I thought it might help break the ice. But he's really holding a grudge for a silly reason if you ask me.", "Yup, you don\u2019t poke a grumpy bear.", "You mean like nkt stealing and holding peoples items hostage? Does that count as minding your bussiness?", "LOL\u2026.I\u2019m old and thought that was hilarious.", "To be fair, they're pretty old. The foreseeable future may only be a day or two.", "Eh based on that age probably not to long", "We used to joke with each other all the time. He just ghosted us after the remodel. I wasn't sure if it was that. My wife thought it might be something medical because they are getting older. Now I know he just doesn't like us anymore.", "The neighbor was hardly reasonable in the way he worded his request.

I fear for his health when he sees your new trash by his old one, it'll be the remodel all over again!!", "> Yes, they have ID numbers.

You just know the behavior has changed. \n\nIf you know him pretty well and you used to talk everyday, then you could probably just broach the subject with him and ask him why his behavior towards you is noticeably different.", "What else do you steal from him", "Lol apparently you have no sense of humor either.  Obviously he wasn't going to keep the can", "No one stole anything though. They got swapped by someone else.", "That note wasn't aggressive. It was a short summary of objective facts. Everyone here is being so sensitive. It's not like he wrote \"Hey trashcan thief!\"", "Me too.", "His wife. She's surprisingly limber for a lady of her age.", "No wonder they stopped speaking with you", "Pretty sure it's the stucco. They're former hippies. Used to swap STDs with strangers all the time in the 60s."]}
