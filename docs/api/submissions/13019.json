You could barely hear anything standing next to them. \n\nI'm not a physicist so I can't explain the physics behind sound getting louder very well, but roughly speaking: if the sound wave continues to travel through the air, nothing happens, but if it comes upon an object the waves are disturbed. It's kinda like waves hitting a quay wall in a harbor resulting in water splashing (you've seen the pictures during a hurricane report). It's also a known fact that the city is louder than the country because the noise stays between the houses and reflects upon surfaces. Maybe someone else can explain the \"how\" and \"why\" better than I can. \n\nAll I can say is noise getting louder over distance is a known phenomenon.", "Heavens no, those are worn for special occasions!", "If someone did something like that, tossing wrappers, a bottle, a cup, etc I have no issues!
