I need to yell for my grandparents (and a lot of other old folk I know) to hear, they\u2019re definitely not more sensitive to loud noises.", "I am doing no such thing. I am rendering a judgment on a sub where people solicit, you know, judgments", "Anecdotally, yes. My grandparents got grumpier about ordinary sounds like using a slightly old-style loud blender or construction.", "The stucco in general or did people wake them up doing work on your house? Probably ridiculous, but did you warn them of the remodel? (Sorry if this is answered downthread.) My neighbors complain if I have guests, regardless of when or the amount of parking, bc they NEED to know when I have book club.", "I had mentioned it several times for more than a year. Took a long time getting estimates on everything. \n\nThe stucco guys were surprisingly quiet. They cover the entire house in brown coat first, which is basically concrete. Then they go over that with the new stucco. It's all done by trowel. No power tools. Just a light scraping noise you can only hear if you open a window.", "We\u2019re you at home through all the remodelling? Is your hearing generally sensitive?", "Stucco is an insulation board that is covered in a coating. You don't really use power tools to install any part of it. Yes construction can be noisy (that's why most of us try to be considerate as much as we can and work doing allowed times but we have a job to do) but Stucco is quiet."]}
