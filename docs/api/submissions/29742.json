They\u2019re just breasts. Western society sexualises nudity, many European cultures do not. It\u2019s quite liberating actually.", "NTA.

However it sounds like it\u2019s not your actual culture which means you\u2019re participating in an activity that you wouldn\u2019t participate in where you live or around your family and friends back home.\n\nWhich means you know that if you were to participate in a culture you aren\u2019t a part of, the context you exist within is the context within which your actions will more than likely be seen by people from your culture. \n\nI am 100% aware that it would weird out my dads friends (who I like and have grown up around) if I was to whip off my top in front of them after years of knowing them and never having established that as a baseline or possibility. I may well be within my rights to do it but it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m suddenly stupid about the nature of that relationship and what the reality of that gesture might do - which is make things extremely awkward.\n\nI have no interest in pushing that boundary and acting like it\u2019s not my problem because I know, no matter how much someone knows and cares for me, no matter how much they would never purposely sexualise me, that a grown adult woman\u2019s naked breasts ARE sexualised in society and even by our own selves. I know the effect my naked breasts could have. I\u2019m not stupid.

Just from what you said, this friends wife seems very insecure, and I am guessing she just didn\u2019t like that you were topless near her husband. Maybe her husband has some creepy tendencies, or maybe she is just insecure and really couldnt handle her husband seeing anyone else they know topless. I dont see what the big deal is, boobs are only sexualized when ppl make them, their real purpose is to feed (prolly more), so her getting upset seems to be about the sexualization of them, so really she is the asshole.", "$20 on woman caught her husband staring", "I live in spain there's a whole hotel and beach dedicated to people walking around nudist so in that respect it shouldn't matter its common for everyone, even British!\n\n\nIf you were around under 18s in their family I possibly see that issue; but then other people  were topless why would kids be there at all? They're probably just prude.

Since it is an appropriate space to do so, be topless if you like.  You're not at fault that Dad's Friend's Wife is insecure or prude or religious.  Her mental illness shouldn't define your life in any way.", "ESH. Okay, I suppose that I needn\u2019t to explain why his wife is an asshole here, so let me try to make an argument why you could also be one. \n\nYou all are from UK. I suppose, there exists a certain culture in Europe region which considers naked body in general and breast in particular as some intimate and sexualised. I also suppose, that the culture in Spain is a different when we talk about that point. \n\nSo, first, his wife could be okay with everyone stranger be naked on the beach because there exist invisible psychological barrier in her mind and two cultures don\u2019t collide with each other. She may simply not perceive them as part of her life.\n\nThen a question may arise, why she had problems with you? Okay, maybe because she consider you as part of her and her husband\u2019s life. You know that you will come back to the UK soon, you will interact with her in some further situations and she is not comfortable with the fact, that she intentionally demonstrated your naked bode for her. I also suppose that some other people in the company could feel a little shame or I don\u2019t know, awkward. But they don\u2019t tell you nothing because it\u2019s just impolite and may be considered offensive. \n\nFinally, I think that you maybe the asshole because you don\u2019t consider the possibility that for someone it could be awkward and uncomfortable. \n\nBtw, for me, and, I suppose, for most people in our culture, the is no problem with you action, but, you know, sometimes you just should think a little about conservative minorities if they are your friend or you have some mutual trip or staff like that.", "NTA but I fun it strange you\u2019re just topless in front of your dad and he doesn\u2019t mind", "YTA if you did not pay for the trip.

Let me be clear here. I'm American. In America, people would freak out if you did that. BUT, Americans are also 100% AWARE that in Spain, Rome, Italy, etc., there are such a thing as topless beaches. People literally book vacations BECAUSE of the topless beaches, some for different reasons than others, I admit. \n\nSo, where I'm unclear is: You're on the beach. I'll assume that the beach is not, in fact, deserted. There are OTHER women on the beach. Let's also assume that you are not the only one who decided to take off their top.

It's adding up to \\*\\*\\*MASSIVE INSECURITY ISSUES\\*\\*\\* sorry...\\*whisper\\* (massive insecurity issues), but if she's that insecure, would it not make sense to either go mental on every woman on the beach, on her poor, virgin husband, or to...I don't know...AVOID the topless beach? \n\nMaybe it's just me?", "NTA.

Yes, a normal beach, where woman are normally topless. Norms change with the location.", "No, I meant topless beach. \n\nIn most of the US, women can't be topless at the beach. Normal changes with the location.", "Please read my comment more carefully. I literally specified adult kids with their parents are not common at beaches and that other cultures are not the same as naturist culture.", "That's fine and all, but this isn't about going to a topless beach. It's about going topless around friends/family. In my example, two people who grew up in similar cultures have very different opinions and experiences with it. OP shouldn't assume that these people who she refers to as \"dad's friend and his family\" would be okay with seeing their friends grown daughter topless.\n\nSure, strangers will be there topless and it's unavoidable, but that doesn't mean you subject others in your party to your nudity without their consent, unless OP's culture also considers that to be an expected norm. Is it expected to go to a beach in the UK and go topless?", "I am guessing you haven\u2019t been to beaches in Spain or France. Very common there at literally every beach. It really isn\u2019t that big a deal and plenty of people also chose to just keep their tops on as well. The thing is OP really wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong so yelling at her and calling her names were way out of bounds regardless if the other people thought she crossed their boundaries. They could have politely asked her or barring that moved to a different spot on the beach.", "The post literally says they are in Spain. On a beach. With lots of other women topless.\n\nSounds like it's pretty damn normal to everyone there.", "It\u2019s just cold here - but yeah tbf I wonder if it\u2019s because people don\u2019t want risk running into their boss or something.\n\nI honestly think if it was as consistently warm here more people would be ok with it.", "but those are not shared norms everyone lives by. as she said being topless where she was is a common occurrence.", "Breasts can be a warning.\n\nBut, seriously: even if you acknowledge OP conforming to the local customs of the place they're vacationing in would be inconsiderate to the wife, the correct response is to politely require if she might be willing to cover up again.

Ofc a towel around your waist or on the seat is just common courtesy but still. Now 20 years later we are still doing it on family gatherings \"optional for everyone ofc\". Even my nieces (15) and nephews (11) dont have a problem with it because its **NOT at all sexual**. The only think i see when i look at them is the little shit heads i used to change diapers on nothing ells.", "Uh. None of my Scandinavian relatives have that attitude. If you\u2019re in the sauna you\u2019re in the sauna and you do normal sauna things no matter who else is there, and you don\u2019t ogle other people.", "It\u2019s not an unexpected boundary violation - it\u2019s a topless beach, most women would be topless so it\u2019s weird to assume that people wouldn\u2019t get their kit off. That argument you made about \u201cflashing\u201d being a crime and now objecting to it is the crime is a false equivalency. In Europe, if you purposely exposed yourself to someone on the street, that is still a crime and could be prosecuted like in the US. At a beach in Spain, it\u2019s a reasonable expectation that people will be nude so it\u2019s not considered \u201cflashing\u201d. As for saying you\u2019d gouge your eyes out than see your family naked, thats up to you but you can\u2019t really enforce it on a nude beach. If you were uncomfortable, it would be up to you to leave. It is a cultural thing though as I know Danish people who sauna as a family naked and don\u2019t care one iota.", "Haha fair point", "Sure, but a beach in Spain is not \u201ca top less beach\u201d. It can just be a beach where some people are topless.\n\nI\u2019m totally fine with an argument that being topless at the beach is fine - I think there is a strong argument for this and it\u2019s a debate that society is not finished having (at least not in the UK). \n\nI just think a lot of the comments a muddying the water here by making other claims or side arguments that are not addressing the issue head on.", "For people who live and travel to Spain. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the norm for the people she was traveling with.!", "It\u2019s because there\u2019s a difference between knowing it\u2019s fine (as in you won\u2019t be angry at a stranger for doing it) and it having zero cultural implications. The fact you don\u2019t want to run into your boss (or, say, your dad\u2019s friend, his wife and kids) is part of those cultural implications. It is simultaneously \u201cOK to sunbathe topless\u201d whilst also potentially making them feel awkward, and you also.\n\nHow we are in a group is much more dependent on the norms for that group than strangers we have no connection to. You care more about running into your boss than a random stranger for a reason.\n\nPeople like to pretend that on the continent there are no rules, but it is actually not true. It might be more common but yes, also because the weather is better and a lot more people on the beach generally. It\u2019s still not an \u201ceveryone does it\u201d thing, and depends on who you\u2019re with.", "If a group of Americans (or Australians or French or whatever) are traveling abroad, and one of them decides to do something that is controversial by the standards of the group's normal culture, then it is basic good manners to warn the group and address any conflicts.\n\nPutting someone in an awkward position unnecessarily is inconsiderate.", "If the friend didn't like it, the correct response was to silently judge OP, not to kick off and make a scene.", "No thanks", "If the issue weren't toplessness but were something you didn't happen to agree with, would you still think it's ok for one travel partner to just decide the whole group is now going to abide by the local cultural norms and abandon their own norms, without warning?", "\u201cMost women\u201d are not topless, even in Spain. It wasn\u2019t a \u2018topless beach\u2019, just a beach where being topless isn\u2019t unusual. There isn\u2019t any other kind of beach.\n\nThe difficult part here is that even in the UK, where OP is from, if you go to a beach you will see the same thing - it actually isn\u2019t all that different to Spain, women sunbathe topless. Yet people would still think it is weird and inappropriate to do It *in certain situations*. Such as if you were with a group that you didn\u2019t know that well, especially if they are a family\u2026 or if any of you is Muslim.\n\nThe point that most people on the other side of the fence are making is that you still take your culture with you when you travel, and can\u2019t cherry pick some ideas from other cultures as being more important to \u2018convert to\u2019 than the ones you have at home, but others not. Particularly if imposing it on other people. For example how you dress, what everyone must eat, whether as a woman you travel without a chaperone, if you give their daughter alcohol (or in a predominantly Muslim country, ban the group from drinking it) etc etc.\n\nI\u2019m not saying OP was wrong, only that it\u2019s not a black and white situation.", "Having gone to beaches where woman cannot be topless, one where women can is a topless beach. \n\nYes, no one forced her to be topless. She could've worn a top. \n\nBut no one forced them to go to Spain or the beach either. \n\nI think you're the only one muddying the waters with your argument of semantics on what a 'topless beach' is. \n\nIf women can be topless, it is a topless beach.", "But if you go somewhere you should accept their culture and mannerisms right? If this woman is so offended by OP\u2019s breasts then she shouldn\u2019t be going to a topless beach.", "Oof, another puritan that wants to see women's bodies controlled and dictated by everyone else. You're part of the problem.", "So when did your aversion to boobs start?", "Don't bring Australians into your rant here. We are very much a when is Rome kinda people and we also have a nude beach in South Australia in Adelaide. Most Aussie couldn't care less if someone in their group went topless on a beach where the norm is topless. This is coming from an Australian who has been to the nude beach several times", "Calm down lmao Jesus", "I\u2019m struggling to think of another example, could you provide one? But to be honest as long as it\u2019s legal, yes I wouldn\u2019t have a problem. Having travelled to countries in Europe, Asia and Africa, part of the experience (for me at least) is immersing yourself in other cultures.

If you don't want to see people topless, you don't go there, instead of berating people who are there topless.", "Calm down lmao Jesus", "Those are not equivalent at all and you know it lol. The first and third examples you gave are rooted in bigotry, hardly the same as being naked. For one, I thoroughly research where I\u2019m travelling beforehand to try and get a vague understanding of what the place is like. And secondly, as someone who has black family members, I wouldn\u2019t go somewhere where racist traditions/customs were that overt. Finally, if I travelled somewhere where I was required to wear a burqa/abaya, then yes I would wear it because it\u2019s the local custom and actually law in some countries."]}
