{"id": 8424, "submission_id": "10mng4z", "title": "AITA for using the treadmill at my building gym for 4 hours?", "selftext": "Basically title. My building has a small resident's gym with about 8 pieces of cardio equipment, 3 bikes, 3 stair / elliptical machines, and 4 treadmills (on top of some strength training machines / weights areas / 2 benches).\n\nI use the treadmill for 4 hours a day (light jog, it's not like I'm Usain Bolting for that long) from 6AM to 10AM (gym operates 6AM to 10PM). During this time the gym is almost empty from 6-7:45\\~ and again from 8:30\\~ to 10AM, Pre 7:45 seems too early for people and post 8:30 too late (assume getting ready / starting work etc.).\n\nI'd say at an absolute MAXIMUM all 4 treadmills are occupied for perhaps 15 minutes every other day. I did a test today and for the entire 4 hours there was at least one treadmill free, and I was alone for over 3 hours of the run. There are plenty of days where capacity isn't hit at all, and the days on which it is it's a very limited time slot from maybe 8:15-8:30. On average I probably run alone for over half the time and with 1-2 others (So still at least 1 treadmill free) for the entirety of the rest.\n\nI understand the concerns around hogging equipment and I'm not remotely denying 4 hours is a very long time. However, there is clearly capacity in the gym (which in Manhattan we pay a ludicrous amount to live in anyway, obviously). You could argue I should step off from 8;15-8:30 if I can see the gym is full, but even then it's 15minutes 1-2 times a WEEK that all 4 are in use.\n\nEither way, we got an e-mail from management reminding us the max to be on any cardio equipment is 45 minutes. I am 99% sure it's aimed at me, as this morning about 3 hours in a lady (I believe the building manager's assistant) informed of the rule tapping me on the shoulder. I continued asking why it's a rule and gestured at the 3 free treadmills next to me. I asked if I hop to another treadmill does that comply with the rule? What about switching to Peloton? She didn't have an answer and just said the rule \"comes from management\" and left. 15 minutes later a doorman comes, same thing, same conversation, he asks my apartment number and I tell him, and he again repeats it's from management and walks off\n\nAm I insane or am I missing something here? If the treadmills were in high demand and I was single handedly blocking 25% capacity for the entire morning slot I would of course be a gigantic asshole with no consideration for others with busy schedules. As I have tried to point out in this post that is NOT the case. I'm sure some people will say clearly I'm not telling the truth as clearly people have complained or something. There are cameras in the gym and if management confronts me I will challenge them to review footage and if they can find more than a 15minute slot at once or 30 minutes throughout the entire week where  all 4 are in use (when I'm there) I will back down.\n\nI really don't understand, but, reddit, am I missing something and am I in fact the asshole?\n\nEDIT: For those asking this is not a written policy and was just communicated by management last night. I would also be happy to pay an extra $50 a month for my high use of the machines if that is what this is about.\n\nEDIT2: Also to mention I've lived here a year and used the gym in a similar manner as described and never run into issues until this morning\n\nEDIT3: For those asking why I don't run outside, it's January, I do run outside from March-November ish.\n\nEDIT4: I see where people are coming from with the wear & tear argument, but as others have pointed out this is a gym standard treadmill, I'm very light and I'm only jogging, I'm not absolutely demolishing that thing for hours a day. That said, as per my first edit, I would happily pay an extra $50 for my high gym usage to management (or a slightly higher figure if they justified it). I'd also point out that this is not year round, but it's dark and freezing outside right now and i don't feel safe running on icy streets. I'd also say that I've used the gym in this manner ever since I moved in a year ago, and have NEVER been confronted in person until this morning. I just don't really get what has changed.\n\nEDIT5: As some people are concerned about a \"good\" treadmill, i mix it up and use a different one each day, I don't specifically use the same treadmill.", "created_utc": 1674832993, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mng4z/aita_for_using_the_treadmill_at_my_building_gym/", "score": 398, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or is it rare even for gyms to have a treadmill running continuously for a long period of time?", "NTA\n\nIf it was the only one?

I own one and it isn't fragile looking but even the guys that installed it said to only use it for an hour then give it time to rest. So maybe the rule is there so you don't cause too much wear and tear on the machine.", "NTA, but I would consider asking manageable about it. Explain that there are nearly always open treadmills and when a neighbor confronted you about the policy, there were 3 unused treadmills.\n\nThey might say 45 minutes is if people are waiting, or they might say 45 minutes is the policy to prevent further wear and tear on the machine, in which case you should go buy a treadmill.", "INFO: Why on earth are you spending 16% of every day on a treadmill?", "Malicious complaince is the way to go, because you need to follow the rules anyway.\n\n45 mins, change to next treadmill, again 45 go to next.

You ARE using shared machines as if they were yours alone and 4 hours is excessive use, which I think is the core issue here. I don't doubt the gym comes at a high cost to you to use but, the building does have rules. Don't be the person who can't follow gym rules.", "NTA if no one is waiting on the treadmills.   She didn't answer your question about hopping on another treadmill, I would just do that.", "NTA but I think it might be that they dont want the one machine running 4 hours continiously everyday.", "NTA but in order not to wear out the machine switch treadmills after 45 minutes and you're all good.", "I'll start off by saying NTA because if the equipment isn't being used by anyone else and no one is waiting, then there is no reason you can't stay on for 4 hours.\n\nThat said, I would head this off at the pass and meet with management to explain your side just as you've done to us. Do it in a non-confrontational way and explain your reasons for staying on that long. Pretty sure you'll come to an agreement.", "I'm finding it hard to believe you run for 4 hours straight every single day but that aside I don't really understand the issue if there is other free machines. The assumption is that if all were being used and a 5th person came by asking to use the treadmill, you would get off as a courtesy as the person who's been on the longest.\n\nI'm going with NTA for now but I'd speak to the management about why this rule exists (wear and tear on the machine?)", "NTA until all of the others are full and you're still going past 45 min. If someone is waiting for one because all the others are being used and you're past that 45, then you should settle for less that 4 hours that day or come back when they're not all taken again.", "Due to OP\u2019s comment about the rule not being posted anywhere, I\u2019m going to go ahead with NTA. It seems you\u2019ve put in the work to know how much of an inconvenience you\u2019re being, which is really not at all. I\u2019m assuming someone in your building may have embellished when they complained. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing, get off if it gets busy enough to where that\u2019s necessary.", "NTA but plainly you are breaking the rule. That's going to leave you open to further issues.

Treadmills are designed for intermittent use unless it's designed for 14 hours of constant use like a medical tread mill, it's a problem. If you MUST run for 4 hours, you need to buy your own machine.", "I understand both positions. You pay for that amenity, you have the right to use it. But if the amenities came with rules, you pay for that, exactly. So, idk. But 4 hrs is an insanely long time.", "Are your Chris Trager ?? I doubt most machines are designed to be used for that long. Regardless, your building has rules. The rules don\u2019t seem to suit your own personal preference or exercising needs. \n\nI understand that you want to take advantage of the fact that the gym is included in your rent price, why not jog outside? Because while you\u2019ve described the gym often not at capacity, you\u2019re still taking up a treadmill for the ENTIRETY of peak gym hours in the AM. \n\nI\u2019m leaning NTA, but I personally think you should talk with your building management as see what the issue is, as there may be factors beyond you breaking the rules", "NTA since it doesn\u2019t seem like you are stopping anyone from working out ?

What the hell does that have to do with it? I understand your frustration with the situation but sadly there isn't much you can do. I also do think it's an asshole move on the management to limit treadmills to 45 mins. It's actually even more asshole to kick you off when there are other treadmills open. A lot of people in the comments are truly boot lickers.", "NTA. For all the people citing wear and tear\u2014 I don\u2019t understand how one person using the machine for 4 hours could be worse than 5 people using it for 45 minutes in succession, which could certainly happen in a high-capacity gym.", "NTA for running, but yes, it is probably a wear and tear thing. Do just as you suggested, switch to a different treadmill every 45 minutes, and they won't have a cause to complain.", "Four hours?? Who even has that kind of time?? \n\nYTA - that puts huge wear and tear on the machine and the gym has told you not to do it.", "Info: What are you running from for 4 hours every day? \n\nNAH, they're probably worried you're going to drop dead on them one of these days.\n\nDo 45 mins then take a 15 min break to stretch or something before jumping back on.", "Nta\n\nBut might be open to hearing what management says. Could be a case of you're just not aware of something that's causing other people inconvenience.", "I think you are NTA. But you should have a chat with management to understand their concerns. Also have you tried pushing the pace a bit? Long runs are nice, but should not be the only thing you do.", "NTA. The only reason for a rule like that one is to make sure that everyone has access to the treadmills. And since you're not preventing anyone else from using a treadmill, there's no point to that rule. The idea that they would tap you on the shoulder in the middle of your run to remind you of that rule while there were empty treadmills next to you is ridiculous.", "Out of curiosity are you taking the \u201cgood\u201d treadmill 4 hours at a time?  I feel like if there\u2019s 4 treadmills but only one has the features I want, then there\u2019s only 1 treadmill.  \n\nAnyway, I think it\u2019s probably kind of a dumb and passive aggressive way for your neighbors and/or landlord to go about it, instead of just talking to you.  That said, it\u2019s their property and their rule.  Soft YTA", "NTA as long as at least one other treadmill remains empty. Just switch machines every 45 mins and you will be complying their rules while still getting your workout.", "NTA\n\nBut once they told you about the rule, you should have stopped or at least contact management to see what the issue is because maybe people were complaining about you? Either way, maybe buy your own treadmill", "I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t get past the jogging 4 hours a day. Are you ok, OP?", "I think you need to look at why you would want to spend 4 hours a day on such a torture device.", "NTA. But if it persists, get a treadmill and a mat and let them deal with the noise complaints from your downstairs neighbor.", "Not reading all that but 4 hours on a treadmill?  How many miles is that?  Damn", "YTA because, even though you raise fair points, the gym has rules. You went on to use the treadmill for hours, despite receiving the email about the max time you can spend on the equipment. Using a treadmill for 4 hours is excessive, and you might damage the motor - that is likely the gym's main reason for concern.\n\nIf you want to run for long periods, go for a 4 hours jog outside or buy your own treadmill. Or comply with the gym's rules.", "NTA and surprised others think you are. I\u2019d talk to management and explain that your alternative is to buy a treadmill and then THEY can field the complaints from the apartment below you. \n\nAbsolutely ridiculous and unnecessary rule given the circumstances. They wouldn\u2019t be able to prevent 5 people from using it for those 4 hours, but now they want to get cheap and prevent you specifically from causing wear and tear on the machines? It\u2019s a gym. That\u2019s part of the deal when you offer tenants a gym. NTA NTA NTA.", "Four hours a day seems excessive use of the machine, they're probably concerned about wear on the machine. Maybe mix up your routine to include exercises other than jogging?  Or is there a noise component at factor? I could imagine that someone thumping along for four hours every day would drive anyone within auditory vicinity nuts\n\nGoing to go with a YTA vote here purely because rules have been implemented and you elected not to follow them because you seem to think that they don't apply to you", "\nEdit due to question answered: YTA. I\u2019m not saying the rule is great, but if they\u2019re applying the rule to everyone, it\u2019s fair. You could talk with management though and figure out why you can\u2019t practice for a marathon or whatever you\u2019re reason is for using the treadmill for 4 hours. Maybe they can explain it to you better, or you can figure out if you need to get your own treadmill or find a different gym. \n\nI DO think that management should be budgeting the life cycle of these machines as if they are used continuously for the full amount of time available. If they\u2019re not, they may be incurring higher than expected maintenance/turn over of the machines. In the time that you\u2019ve been using the machine for that long, does it seem like there\u2019ve been new machines? If so, you may be killing all their equipment. \n\nInfo: is this rule posted anywhere in the gym or your rental agreement? \n\nI\u2019m guessing someone\u2019s complaining about you, and honestly, 4 hours is a really long time to use a piece of equipment, it could be able wear and tear.", "It's not about capacity it's about damage to the machines. but they should have actually explained the reason as opposed to just because management says so.", "NTA.  This is inane.    If they are never crowded, the max was probably put in to cover them in  case someone has a heart attack and they don't want to be negligent.  Change machines every 45 minutes to get around this stupid rule, and I would say step off ANY time all others are in use so you can never be accused of hogging.\n\nIf there is a board, I would email them and tell them you are being harassed about workout time in an empty gym and see what they say.", "YTA  \n\nThey own the equipment, not you.  Management put out their expectations. They are paying attention to you. If you continue to violate the facility rules don\u2019t be surprised if you lose your gym privileges. \n\nGet your own treadmill if you want to run on the treadmill for 4 hours.", "YTA. The time limit for machines exists for the whole gym---not just treadmills and not just for you.  If they didn't enforce it with you, they would find it a hassle to enforce it to someone else who **is** hogging a high demand item. Overuse of the equipment could also be a factor.\n\nJust because no one has complained in the moment, to your face, doesn't mean your neighbors are OK with this.

You're not abusing the equipment for using it incorrectly, you're using the equipment for its intended use.

You're paying for the membership and you're using the equipment as it's intended. If the gym really has a problem they can buy more treadmills, or up the cost of membership to balance out the costs.\n\nEDIT: Going to come back to just bring in an alternate perspective. Talk to the gym manager and see what their primary concern is (if it's availability, wear and tear due to continued use at that output, etc) and see if you can find an agreeable compromise. If there are genuine concerns about running a treadmill for over 45 minutes, as it may cause more damage to the machine, then just tell them you'll switch every 45 minutes to make sure you're not running one machine on end.

If one machine runs 4 hours straight each day it's way above average use which means the threadmill, or at least the motor has to be replaced sooner than anticipated. Even if you switch between the 4 threadmills each day there will still be above average use and the warranty could not be valid as the insurance company could say the damage is not within the warranty conditions. The motor could also overheat if run too long at the time. While the electric board inside the threadmill will stop any damage it also adds to \"wear and tear\" because if it runs hot on a regular base it won't be as efficient anymore also adding to the electric bill. What also adds extra cost is the electricity itself. If the machine is in use for that long it adds to the electricity bill. So if you're willing to pay an extra 50 bucks a month for your extreme use I'd suggest you get a threadmill yourself because then you'll see that you absolutely will tear it down with your extreme use.

No one else gets free time in the morning at the gym on their own, ever. The electricity usage, the wear and tear on the equipment (treadmills need maintenance/servicing/lubrication every X hours used or miles run, and replaced every Y hours used or miles run).\n\nLet's do some math on it. Let's say a treadmill needs maintenance every 150 hours. Someone using it 45 minutes a day runs 5 hours a week. It would take them over 7 **months** for maintenance. You're using it **28 hours a week**, so maintenance is every 5 **WEEKS**.\n\nWhy don't you just get your own treadmill in your apartment? There's plenty of apartment-sized ones.\n\nI'd frankly be very upset if, every single morning, there is 0 time I can go in without the same guy, day after day, using the treadmill for HOURS. 45 minutes means someone else has a shot at being on a treadmill with privacy AT SOME POINT. Your usage means no one can, EVER.\n\nYou've already proclaimed yourself NTA, and edited over and over your reasons why you're not.  But the truth is you're using the treadmill an inordinate amount of time, not once a month, not once a week, but EVERY DAY.\n\nWith that kind of use, you need your own, or you need to limit yourself to the 45 minutes they've asked.  If you'd been on an hour a day, no one was going to say \"you need to be on 45 minutes\". But 4 hours - about 30 hours a week! - is beyond the pale.\n\nYTA", "Hey OP, are you ok? 4 hours is a long time, and daily would be straining your body especially without rest days. Is it possible your treadmill use is a substitute vice for your quitting drinking?

Some people might want 15-20 minutes to themselves to use a treadmill and might feel self conscious, especially if they're out of shape and starting out.

I understand your points but those are the gym rules. Clearly they decided them for a reason. Sounds like from the email it has been 45 minutes for some time and you have been ignoring that.

I don't think objectively  YTA outside of just not following the rule, but as someone who deeply, deeply loves that feeling when you go to a communal gym at the break of dawn so you can use it when it's empty, it would be so annoying for there to be the same dude just always there running on his hamster wheel.", "I don't see the issue if you're not keeping another resident from using a treadmill.

I\u2019ve seen people jumping between machines and it can be a really obnoxious thing to do and inconvenience others and 4 hours of that is definitely exhausting.

The gym sounds mostly unoccupied, they have 4 treadmills, and it\u2019s cold out.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is, true gym etiquette is to share. I\u2019m not going to argue wear and tear because realistically a treadmill should be able to handle that kind of use. The only real concern I could see would be that the belt and gears/internal workings may need to cool down for short periods with extended hours of use like that and might call for you to take a short break every so often. I\u2019m not a treadmill tech though, and to harp on that I would need to know some specifics (how often should a break happen, how long etc)\n\nIf you see someone coming in, when all treadmills are occupied, and you\u2019ve been on for over an hour, you should get off or at least ask if they were coming in to run. That\u2019s courtesy. People may only have the same free time you do to run, and it would be frustrating to come in and find that every time all the treadmills are occupied you are ALWAYS on them and have been for a while.\n\nIt may be time to start investing in endurance runs in the cold. Plenty of people do it, I would probably hate it, but I would recognize that the caveat to not being willing to do that is that sometimes my runs are going to be cut short by other people needing to use the equipment. Most people who run for that long, either run outside or purchase their own treadmill. I\u2019m assuming you do not have the space or finances or both for that, but that means your situation is what it is.
