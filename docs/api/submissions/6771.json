To this day, I cannot refer to my grandmother (to my mother) by the name I called her my whole life. I never understood why my mother was so upset about what we called my grandmother. When I had children of my own, I understood how awful that must have been for my mother. A few years ago, the subject came up in conversation with my mother (who is almost 80). I apologized to her and told her that I understood how inappropriate it was for her mother to do that. I also told her that, for the record, it was just a name to me. I was never confused about who my mother was, even though I called my grandmother \u2018momma\u2019. No matter how your daughter\u2019s stepmother acts or what she calls her, your daughter knows who is who. IMO, it\u2019s far better to have a stepparent who wants to help than one who is awful to your daughter.

Now it\u2019s your responsibility to reign him in.  The courts should be last resort.", "Then I would firmly point this out to both your ex and his wife.

He's not got full custody so of course he wants to see her as much as he can, same with his wife. Best to make the most of your own time with her like going to the park, movies etc and accept they will be  there at all school events. \n\nYou've only started with the issues. Just wait until stepmommy enrols her in ballet classes  while you're working and buys her dozens of cute new outfits.  The swimming and sports and, and, and.  Smile sweetly, let them pay and expect you get to attend their events too.", "Don't trust reddit armchair lawyers lol", "Yes actively trying to get your daughter to call step parent mom and her buying in. She is a step parent she has no rights/authority.this between you and her father.", "It only works if you can prove it and your daughter willingly calling her mom cause she loves her will not fly and honestly most of these grievances are kinda just what a good parental figure would do. The only things I see as issues is the kissing on the lips thing and the not respecting boundaries but at the same time I think you are also overreacting a bit cause your feeling pushed aside in your daughters life. Her stepmom going to school events and parent teacher meetings is normal nothing wrong with it as well as her calling her mom isn\u2019t bad necessarily either if that\u2019s what your daughter wants. I understand feeling hurt by it but would you rather her be mean to your child cause that\u2019s what a lot of other stepmoms do. And think if the situation was reversed and it was your husband going to these meetings and being called daddy and your ex was mad and did the things you have said and done? \nNow I don\u2019t know everything as I don\u2019t know the specifics of what you have said exactly to them cause you could easily be lying and I don\u2019t know any of you and she could be overstepping but without knowing the full interactions and what you have specifically said and they said. My opinions are just based on what I have read here so new info could change it. But I think this is more of a grey area cause I mean if your boundaries that you have talked to them about are her not going to school events then that\u2019s just stupid cause any person who cares about a child no matter their relationship to then will go to a school event. And if the birthday party was happening on his time then he has no obligation to invite you just as if you have a party for her on your time you have no obligation to invite them. The thing is to think of what\u2019s best for your daughter and if she loves her and is ok with her being involved and wants her there then all your doing in trying to establish all these boundaries is hurt your daughter. Something I believe strongly in when it comes to stepparents is that they have whatever kind of relationship the child wants and it could change over time. The other parent I feel should for the most part stay out of it. I say the most part because there are some step parents who try and force a relationship and it ends up bad usually. Honestly I think the best thing to do would be to sit down with both your ex and his wife and explain your feelings and see if there is a compromise. Like since she\u2019s a stepmom she could be called mama ( whatever her name Is) instead of mom or something like that so you can feel like you have respect and are not being replaced and she can feel like the kid she loves and takes care of half the time that loves her can call her something affectionate. There is no right and wrong when it comes to being a stepparent as there are so many factors that are hard to deal with that most people don\u2019t have to deal with like seeing another woman take care of your child or a bitch step mom who is horrible to your child or one who is in your child\u2019s life but not in a parental way so it\u2019s just a lot and people don\u2019t always handle things well. I hope this helps or maybe opens your mind and heart a bit. Or you can just ignore it as I\u2019m not a parent let alone a step parent but I don\u2019t think anyone in this situation is an ass I mean if they are ignoring boundaries that can be an ass move but if they are doing it only cause she requests it then idk there is just not enough info in my opinion to make a complete conclusion as there\u2019s variables not noted in the post.

However, you may be able to adjust the schedule so that regular events synch up with their visitation.", "It\u2019s really fucking weird that she\u2019s forcing your daughter to both hug her and kiss her on the lips.

She needs to respect your boundaries !!", "This is much too complex a situation for me to even contemplate a judgement. So, I'll just, say, I'm really sorry that this is hurtful. I think most, if not all, divorced parents struggle with someone coming in to their ex's life seriously enough that the person becomes another parental figure to their children. It's fraught, and it's very understandable that you are struggling with it.\n\nYour Edit 2 is strong game. I wish you the best.", "u/anony5670 I agree. Get on top of this ASAP. I had a great coparenting relationship with my daughter's father for 12 years, right up until he quickly got engaged and then married to a woman who did not want me in the picture. She was relatively nice to me to my face but worked hard to undermine my relationship with my daughter, and things kept escalating from there, to the point where my daughter started refusing to come to my house and I had to go to court to get her back. Then a lengthy and traumatic court battle followed. \n\nI had a court order for full custody at the time, but it didn't list dates and times, so if your order doesn't list dates and times, that should be your first step as soon as you can, because if they convince your daughter to say that she doesn't want to come back to your house, there isn't anything you can do about it other than wait for a court date. If there are dates and times, the cops (if you are in the US) can send her back home with you. This is important, because my daughter was refusing to come home because stepmom had been threatening her with love (that dad wouldn't love her if she didn't do what she said), and it got worse with every week she spent there. Getting my daughter into therapy helped a lot, plus spending more quality time with her once she was home helped a ton, too. \n\nAlso, with any order, make sure there is a clause that says that no one can disparage either parent in front of the child. If they do, it's contempt of the order. \n\nI'm so sorry you're having to go through this. I hope you're able to stop any inappropriate behavior and won't have to go through what I did. My situation worked out well in the end, though. My daughter and I are closer than ever, and her dad ended up divorcing the stepmom so she's no longer in our lives. Turns out, she was abusing him, too.", "I\u2019m so happy and sad  to see this as the top post.

I would be particularly leery of the fact that your daughter feels uncomfortable talking to you about the kisses. Is she uncomfortable talking to you about other things that happen while she is with her father? Not to say any sort of sexual abuse is taking place - I just think that maybe her father and step mother are encouraging her to keep secrets from you. These secrets don\u2019t even need to be about anything nefarious. It shouldn\u2019t be happening at all. She should feel open to talking to you about anything that happens at her father\u2019s home.

Jealousy that another woman has more time for your daughter than you do? This woman is her step mother; you don't get to regulate what her father and stepmother do with her, other than to the extent the court does, and it isn't going to address any of the issues you've brought up, except possibly taking trips out of state without both parents. And why the fuck would you want to go away with them anyway? Take your own trip if you're so well paid you think lawyers are a good answer here.\n\nHonestly you sound like you've lost the plot a bit and they are probably fair enough to ignore your boundaries, especially if your kid is happy. Your boundaries aren't important to them and shouldn't be, if the kid is happy and well.", "I don't get how you can say you have full custody when you have 50-50 custody?\n\nUltimately best case scenario is your kid is loved. I think this situation is hard for you, it makes sense it is, and it hurts watching your child have this relationship with another woman. But you said she's known her a couple years, she's very young and now her stepmom is married to her dad at that age it kind of makes sense that she views someone like her as a bonus mom. You aren't an asshole for struggling with these emotions.\n\nIt's okay that you're hurting, but I think you need to working through it so you don't put your daughter in an uncomfortable spot (I say as the daughter of divorced parents who never had issues in front of us but it was obvious it was uncomfortable and who had a parent - not the remarried one who made things very challenging)\n\nIt's pretty simple to strike a balance you guys go to non-school events on the days you have your daughter. So if friends party is on Saturday and you have her you get to go, if friends party is on dad's Saturday he (and Stepmom) go. For your kids birthday you alternate who gets to throw the party with school friends and the other parent gets to do a special day or a second party with their side of the family or whatever. School events is whoever is available to go gets to go. \n\nIf you want special memories with your kid you have to go ahead and make them, take them special places like a theme park, the aquarium or zoo, etc or make a special routine for every Saturday morning you have her or whatever.

Plenty of over affectionate families do that.\n\nOtherwise, if the daughter wants to call her stepmother mommy, and if she's happy and well, why should OP's feelings and boundaries matter to her father? OP isn't the ruling parent who gets to decide all parenting matters; they can reasonably disagree and parent differently in their different homes.", "Unless you have told step mom directly she may not know these issues are bothering you.. you don\u2019t have a legal custody order which is a huge thing.. you cannot ban step mom from coming to school events either a judge won\u2019t care how you feel about it.. I would be appreciative of someone stepping up when you can\u2019t be there vs threatened by it. The kissing on the mouth thing is 100% weird and a hill to die on but everything else seems kinda trivial. Parent alienation is SO hard to prove even with therapist and Gal involved so you probably won\u2019t get far with that. I would try to reach out to her and get lunch and talk about things. People say a lot of shitty things when they are emotional or upset so maybe she said she didn\u2019t respect you in the past but that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t want to work as a team now for your daughter!

The girl doesn\u2019t want to be kissed and doesn\u2019t want to talk about it; she\u2019s being bribed with an expensive trip to Disneyland. This looks very bad. She needs to talk to a therapist who can gently explore whether she\u2019s being sexually abused. Be sure to document everything in case the father and stepmother try to take full custody.

In your culture, kissing on the lips is a no - honestly I think it's not ok from a germs perspective and it's not like it's a totally normal thing in any culture.
