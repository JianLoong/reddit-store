To this day, I cannot refer to my grandmother (to my mother) by the name I called her my whole life. I never understood why my mother was so upset about what we called my grandmother. When I had children of my own, I understood how awful that must have been for my mother. A few years ago, the subject came up in conversation with my mother (who is almost 80). I apologized to her and told her that I understood how inappropriate it was for her mother to do that. I also told her that, for the record, it was just a name to me. I was never confused about who my mother was, even though I called my grandmother \u2018momma\u2019. No matter how your daughter\u2019s stepmother acts or what she calls her, your daughter knows who is who. IMO, it\u2019s far better to have a stepparent who wants to help than one who is awful to your daughter.

I have full custody so we are going to have to go through court to agree on a shared parenting agreement.", "Boundaries need to be respected is all I'm saying and it sounded to me like the stepmom wasn't being respectful of them.", "Clearly you have allowed the situation with your ex to get out of hand. Now it\u2019s your responsibility to reign him in.  The courts should be last resort.", "Then I would firmly point this out to both your ex and his wife.

Is she the one who has decided to call her mommy? Is your ex and her looking to get full custody? \n\nBe careful with being charged with parental alienation yourself, if you are visibly grumpy about events with him and his wife. He's not got full custody so of course he wants to see her as much as he can, same with his wife. Best to make the most of your own time with her like going to the park, movies etc and accept they will be  there at all school events. \n\nYou've only started with the issues. Just wait until stepmommy enrols her in ballet classes  while you're working and buys her dozens of cute new outfits.  The swimming and sports and, and, and.  Smile sweetly, let them pay and expect you get to attend their events too.", "Don't trust reddit armchair lawyers lol", "Yes actively trying to get your daughter to call step parent mom and her buying in. She is a step parent she has no rights/authority.this between you and her father.", "It only works if you can prove it and your daughter willingly calling her mom cause she loves her will not fly and honestly most of these grievances are kinda just what a good parental figure would do. The only things I see as issues is the kissing on the lips thing and the not respecting boundaries but at the same time I think you are also overreacting a bit cause your feeling pushed aside in your daughters life. Her stepmom going to school events and parent teacher meetings is normal nothing wrong with it as well as her calling her mom isn\u2019t bad necessarily either if that\u2019s what your daughter wants. I understand feeling hurt by it but would you rather her be mean to your child cause that\u2019s what a lot of other stepmoms do. And think if the situation was reversed and it was your husband going to these meetings and being called daddy and your ex was mad and did the things you have said and done? \nNow I don\u2019t know everything as I don\u2019t know the specifics of what you have said exactly to them cause you could easily be lying and I don\u2019t know any of you and she could be overstepping but without knowing the full interactions and what you have specifically said and they said. My opinions are just based on what I have read here so new info could change it. But I think this is more of a grey area cause I mean if your boundaries that you have talked to them about are her not going to school events then that\u2019s just stupid cause any person who cares about a child no matter their relationship to then will go to a school event. And if the birthday party was happening on his time then he has no obligation to invite you just as if you have a party for her on your time you have no obligation to invite them. The thing is to think of what\u2019s best for your daughter and if she loves her and is ok with her being involved and wants her there then all your doing in trying to establish all these boundaries is hurt your daughter. Something I believe strongly in when it comes to stepparents is that they have whatever kind of relationship the child wants and it could change over time. The other parent I feel should for the most part stay out of it. I say the most part because there are some step parents who try and force a relationship and it ends up bad usually. Honestly I think the best thing to do would be to sit down with both your ex and his wife and explain your feelings and see if there is a compromise. Like since she\u2019s a stepmom she could be called mama ( whatever her name Is) instead of mom or something like that so you can feel like you have respect and are not being replaced and she can feel like the kid she loves and takes care of half the time that loves her can call her something affectionate. There is no right and wrong when it comes to being a stepparent as there are so many factors that are hard to deal with that most people don\u2019t have to deal with like seeing another woman take care of your child or a bitch step mom who is horrible to your child or one who is in your child\u2019s life but not in a parental way so it\u2019s just a lot and people don\u2019t always handle things well. I hope this helps or maybe opens your mind and heart a bit. Or you can just ignore it as I\u2019m not a parent let alone a step parent but I don\u2019t think anyone in this situation is an ass I mean if they are ignoring boundaries that can be an ass move but if they are doing it only cause she requests it then idk there is just not enough info in my opinion to make a complete conclusion as there\u2019s variables not noted in the post. I hope you all can work this out as peacefully as possible for the sake of your daughter", "Then choose things for you and your daughter to do that are not school or group social events.
