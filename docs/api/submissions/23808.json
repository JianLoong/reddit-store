Especially at night when it's about time to put the kids to sleep. By this time I am already exhausted. I have told him multiple times that I'm too tired to discuss around the kids bedtime, but he again, asked me a series of questions. When do babies sleep through the night, when is the national holiday that's coming up, why did I get so little money from my paternity leave? Finally I snapped and told him I'm not fucking Google! \n\nNow he's sulking upstairs and I'm beginning to feel like an ahole. So am I?\n\nSo an update: thanks everyone! You guys were spot on! I had a lot of reflecting to do. He just wanted to talk about anything.

He's trying areas of common interest or topics that might emotionally hook you. He's not going about it in a very effective way, which must be frustrating for you both. You're not getting peace and he's not getting you. Hopefully you can find a time when you are both calm and well rested (with kids? hah!) to talk over the personal challenges of sharing a life with children and come up with some solutions towards getting the things you are both missing out on.\n\nWhen my son was little, he used to ask the most intriguing questions at bedtime. One night he asked me to tell him about Einstein. Parenting gold, right? But I was tired. I told him it was bedtime and to ask me again in the morning. He never did.\n\nHe's over 30 now, and he knows all he wants to about Einstein because he can read. And he fully admits that the questions were a ploy to prolong bedtime.", "Nta but maybe that\u2019s his way of initiating conversation?", "It sounds like he just wants to hang out with you, especially if this happens a lot at night when you're getting ready to put the kids to bed. He's probably doubly hurt because he's lonely and also he feels like he made you upset. YTA but only a little bit. Just explain that your social battery is at a low around that time when his is high and try and find a compromise that lets you have some rest together? He seems to like you and you seem concerned, I have high hopes things will work out :)", "NAH. Honestly I think this is just the dynamic of some relationships, one is the person with the info and the other is the question asker. I\u2019ve had a similar disagreement with my partner and he explained it as \u201cyou just know these things\u201d. I explain that it\u2019s exhausting having to be on top of everything all the time and he said that I should just tell him to look it up in future. \n\nI get how it is wearing, but he\u2019s not doing it out of badness.", "gently, my mom kind of does this because she's curious and likes to engage in conversation with people. my dad one time snapped at her and said she was incessant and it was annoying, and it really hurt her feelings and deflated her for a long time. i'm not going to call you an AH though, because everyone loses their patience and temper.", "NAH sounds like he's getting on your nerves and isn't picking up on that. It's actually kind of cute that he looks to you to have all the answers but he also should figure things out for himself too.", "Oh! I relate to this so hard. My partner is wayyy chattier than I am, and I need a lot of silence/alone time to recharge. I've had to train myself to control the impulse to push him away in these situations. Sometimes I am tired and grumpy and just want to be alone, but he is excited that I'm home and wants to ask me a million things, tell me about his day, get my opinions about his upcoming plans, etc.... I just take a breath, remind myself how much I adore his talkiness when I have the bandwidth, and nod along. Then when there's a break in the stream (he's like a freight train), I ask him for time - a few minutes to settle in, or finish what I'm doing, or have a little quiet time, (this next part is key) BECAUSE I love him and I want to engage with him, but my mind is already in too many places. \n\nYou're not an asshole. You're just two individuals with different needs. He doesn't know he's stomping on your need for quiet when he's trying to get his need for attention met. Just communicate to him how you feel and why you reacted so strongly, and make sure he knows it's not because you don't want to engage with him.", "INFO: in which tone was he asking?\n\nLike someone said, sometimes dumb or random questions are a way to start conversations, and sometimes I feel it's just enough to reply, \"I don't know.\"\n\nIf he was was somehow being malicious in his tone, trying to be annoying, or just obnoxious, I'd understand your reaction, but it seems like pretty harmless but lazy icebreakers", "I think he just want to initiate conversation.", "Why doesn't he know when babies sleep through the night if you have kids?

It's 70% him, 30% you, in terms  of ESH, though.  \n\nSince this happens often, time to have a sit down discussion and stop stewing about it.  You're tired and don't like being badgered with BS that he can google later.", "[deleted]", "NAH. It\u2019s only possible to say no so many times before snapping. He should have also noted your responses. But it sounds like he was trying to find ways of engaging with you, and that this was simply a misfire.", "YTA. Yes, he could Google all of these things. I'm sure he's well aware of that. He is asking you because he just wants to talk to you. It sounds to me like he's just trying to start conversations.\n\nYou sound busy, and it looks like he's looking for a way to connect with you. So if you're stressed out ask him to help out with stuff around the house and start doing it together as a bonding activity instead of snapping at him. He clearly wants to spend time with you.", "NTA. one of my exes used to do this on purpose to annoy me and then get all shocked and sad if I asked him to slow down or ask why he was asking all these questions. not saying your husband is this kind of troll but it sounds like a setup if he's asking and asking and asking and then gets sad if you're understandably asking why he's doing it or giving signals and clear words about how it's impacting you", "Honestly, ESH. I don\u2019t think your husband is trying to be annoying by asking you these questions; he might just be trying to have a conversation or expressing curiosity about something. On the other hand, I understand how that can be irritating after a long day. But the fact that you snapped at him makes you a tad assholey as well. I think the two of you should have an open discussion about this issue so that you can improve your communication and prevent this from becoming an even bigger thorn in your sides!", "Get him an Alexa so he can talk to \"her\" lol", "YTA, so you\u2019re not google, you don\u2019t know everything, what is a very regular response to being asked a question you don\u2019t know\n\nIt\u2019s: \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d \n\nOther variations are, \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d \u201cI dunno\u201d \u201cbeats me\u201d etc\n\nYou\u2019re response was founded on agitation that he\u2019s simply asking you questions \n\nOther solutions to avoiding him asking you questions you don\u2019t know is communicating, \u201csometimes when you ask me questions I get flustered because I don\u2019t know the answers to those questions, if it\u2019s a question about me I can try my best to answer, if it\u2019s about the habits of babies or anything else I wouldn\u2019t mind if you jumped on your phone to research the answer and then perhaps you could share what you\u2019ve found with me\u201d", "I swear to god like 90% of people on Reddit must have some form of Autism or just be completely unable to read a social situation.
