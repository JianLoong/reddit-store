What I didn\u2019t know at the time was while I was just trying to run from a bad situation to build a life with the person I thought had saved me, was that my fianc\u00e9 (a soon to be diagnosed narcissist and psychopath) found engagement to be the quickest fast track for a year and a half of manipulation and abuse. Being blinded by love and having a history of abuse I continued to plan the wedding and we planned it in full. A couple months later the relationship finally ended.  After taking some time to heal I started dating my best friend and we plan to get married in the near future. We haven\u2019t set an official date yet so I have plenty of time but knowing the stress of wedding planning from planning the first wedding, I\u2019ve been looking around and I cannot find another dress I could see myself in. I kept my dress from the first engagement and I adore it. It was beautiful, fit perfectly, and made me feel like a bride and a princess the way little girls always dream of.

No one here knows if it would hurt his feelings. NTA", "First of, NTA as you\u2019re allowed to do whatever you please with that dress.\n\nBUT, does the husband know this dress was meant to marry your ex in? I don\u2019t know, that might be a bit weird. However if the new husband doesn\u2019t care\u2026 neither should you. I wouldn\u2019t want to bring that baggage to the new wedding if new husband has ANY not so great feelings about it.", "So you have had a wedding dress for years, that you showed your best friend (and current partner), but you never actually wore it as a wedding dress?\n\nIf it makes you feel special and you can't find another dress which makes you feel even close, then it makes sense to wear it.\n\nHowever, it wants a conversation with your fianc\u00e9 so he understand your reasoning, and also forewarning to anyone else who know about the dress to avoid potential awkward conversations on the big day. As long as you don't blindside your fianc\u00e9, and don't ignore any discomfort he may have with the idea, NAH. \n\nLet me ask you this (not expecting an answer here, just food for thought) : when you saw the dress and tried it on, what were your first thoughts? Was it 'I want to wear this dress when I marry \\[ex's name\\]' or 'I want to wear this dress on my wedding day'. If it is the latter, then the dress wasn't really about the groom, but about you.\n\nI've another question for you to consider : is the dress *perfect?*  If it isn't perfect, but close enough, does it lend itself to having some re-working done - embroidery or lace or something which changes the look slightly? You could still have your perfect fit, feel like a princess, but a little work could help it to suit the person you've become in the intervening years. \n\nI would also add two points... \n\nFirst, until you have the conversation, you can't know, but there is a possibility if your now-fianc\u00e9 liked the dress - he might have imagined seeing you wear it with him stood beside you as your groom. \n\nSecond, if anyone has an issue with you wearing it on the basis of you disrespecting your first boyfriend, even after his treatment of you, screw them. It sounds like your ex isn't deserving of your respect.", "NTA, IMO. If I am reading this correctly the wedding never happened with the original engagement, correct? I think you can consider the dress unused. I mean the only issue would be how you feel about it. And if you're good it's good. Congratulations!", "NTA. You never wore the dress and it's your wedding. If that's the dress that best reflects you then that's the dress. NTA", "NTA on condition you speak to your fiance. If he understands your attachment to the dress is about how it makes you feel and has nothing to do with your ex I'm sure he won't have a problem with it. \n\nUltimately it's a dress of your choice which is already paid for so why not?", "NTA as long as fianc\u00e9 won\u2019t feel negatively. \n\nHowever, I would recommend altering it (your style has likely changed a bit so make it suit you now. Change the sleeves, add a jeweled belt/Sash, add a pop of color of some kind from your current weddings theme. Change the veil if you have one. Different shoes. Different accessories. Small things that make it you today, and this wedding. So while the dress is the same, the LOOK is not. \n\nAlso as long as you\u2019re not reusing the rest kf the plans, this is one thing - if you\u2019re reusing a bunch (flower plans, colors, venue, etc. then I could see it being more of an issue.)", "You\u2019re not the asshole for considering it, however you would be the asshole if you just did it without confirming with your partner that this would not be hurtful to him. \n\nThe fact that he\u2019s already seen it, seen you in it, and knows it was intended for a different wedding to a different person is highly relevant here. You say in the comments that he was your friend throughout your relationship with your abusive ex. It\u2019s very likely that dress conjures up more painful memories for him (what it was like to watch a friend he cares about plan a wedding with someone who was hurting her) and that he may want to have the experience of not seeing his future wife in her dress before the wedding (especially if he\u2019s superstitious about it). If he can\u2019t see the dress without being reminded of seeing you in it while you were with someone else, then it\u2019s not the right wedding dress for you. On the other hand, he may actually find it romantic that he helps you pick out the perfect dress before you two even knew you\u2019d be together. The only way to know is to ask him. Before you do though, consider this: You say it\u2019s perfect, but is it really perfect if it hurts him? \n\nIn other words, if he is not enthusiastically on board with you recycling this dress, it\u2019s no longer the perfect dress for you. It just isn\u2019t. Because your wedding is about both of you. So you need to find a way to let go of the idea that this is the perfect dress.\n\nTalk to him after you get engaged and have a date. Let him know you\u2019ve been having trouble finding a dress and, if he doesn\u2019t know, tell him how much dresses cost. Ask him how he feels about you wearing this one either as it is, or altered, for any part of the day. Offer to put the money you would spend on a dress toward something else for the wedding or your life together that he\u2019d enjoy (a honeymoon destination, a specific band at the wedding, etc.). If he\u2019s even slightly hesitant, don\u2019t wear the dress. If he says yes, I\u2019d still consider changing the dress slightly and/or wearing a different dress for part of your wedding. For example, surprising him by walking down the aisle in something else and then changing into an altered version of this dress for the reception, and then changing into a different cheaper dress for him to rip off you at the end of the night. That way he still gets a first look and photos with a dress that is uniquely for the wedding, you still get to have others see you in the dress you love and party in the one you\u2019re comfortable with/ feel your best in, and his memories of the more intimate parts of the wedding are his alone. This can actually be accomplished fairly cheaply since the end of the evening dress can be more of a fast fashion piece and the walk down the aisle can be a sale piece.\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to consider the other implications of wearing this dress. It\u2019s one of those small things that is a personal decision between you and him, but still has the potential to erupt into the kind of conflict that can really undermine a relationship. For example, let\u2019s say he says he\u2019s okay with it to make you happy but then when a relative of his (such as his mother) asks if they will be invited dress shopping he tells that relative you\u2019re wearing the dress you bought for a previous engagement that failed. If that person senses his disappointment and disapproved you can bet your ass it\u2019ll become an issue or point of gossip. While that\u2019s not your fault if it happens, I find it hard to believe you really can\u2019t find a single other dress that you\u2019d like and that would avoid drawing negative attention to you, to a previous ill advised engagement, etc.\n\nGo dress shopping with an open mind and several trusted friends. Try not to assume that this time planning has to be stressful (it really shouldn\u2019t be with the right partner). This is the difference between planning a wedding where one person is rushing things to be better able to control the other and planning a wedding as part of planning a life together. You should be talking to him about what he also wants for a wedding. Does that \u201cfirst look\u201d moment matter to him whether you do it privately or when walking down the aisle? What pictures does he care about? Is it important to him that you be able to move freely for specific dances/ and or be in something at the end of the night that can get sprayed with Champagne? Or does he not care at all? Talk to your partner if you\u2019re still really struggling to find a dress, if the dress you have fits what he does and doesn\u2019t envision for your wedding, and if you think he won\u2019t care and maybe then consult with a really good designer on what can be done to alter the one you have in a way you still love.\n \nJust wearing the dress, without talking to him, because you want to feel like a princess on your wedding day is how you make the mistake of prioritizing a wedding over an actual marriage. If you actually want a good marriage with him you\u2019ll talk to him and figure out what the compromises here are if there does need to be some compromise. Some of that might mean letting go of the childish and immature little girl dreams here (that\u2019s pretty clearly a part of what went wrong last time). You\u2019re an adult, there is more than one dress out there for you and no dress should come at the expense of potentially deeply hurting someone you love and want to build a future with.\n\nIn other words, if he\u2019d be hurt then you would be the asshole. The only way to know if he\u2019d be hurt is to communicate directly with him.", "ABSOLUTELY NTA You like the dress.\nIt makes you feel good. Wear the dress and enjoy your wedding!", "NTA\n\nYou can style it differently, by wearing your hair/makeup/accessories different\n\nIf you REALLY want to change it up and go non-traditional, you could even get your dress dyed, if you wanted\n\nThis is YOUR dress, your wedding\n\nI will say though that if your fiance has seen the dress, given that you intened to wear it for your wedding to your ex, please talk to him about it and give him a heads up of the situation, so it isn't a shock the day of the wedding \n\nIt is your decision, but it would be an asshole thing to do to blind side him like that\n\nEta extra information", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You never got to wear your dress before. And even if you did, what about it? \n\nI have the dress from my first marriage, and I am a bit thrifty.

At the end of the day I\u2019d marry him in my pajamas if need be because ultimately I\u2019m just looking forward to building a life with him. It shouldn\u2019t cause any issues with family however as neither of our mothers are super interested in being involved in the planning process, they\u2019re happy for us but both have been relatively distant our entire lives and the plan was for him to help me pick out a dress anyways. We\u2019re not superstitious about the dress and had planned to pick out both sets of attire together. Wedding dresses are just very expensive and I\u2019m struggling to justify spending that much money on something I don\u2019t love especially given that we are on a budget.  As for \u201cwhat went wrong last time\u201d though, my previous fianc\u00e9 was physically dangerous to the extent I required police involvement to collect my things from our home when I decided I could no longer continue in the relationship to ensure I made it out safely so I don\u2019t think the dress was the biggest contributing factor there. At the end of the day I\u2019ll definitely talk to my partner though as yea I agree his input is most important", "You can always offer having some things altered on it, so it's not the same dress when you are having the conversation. \nIt doesn't have to be anything major.
