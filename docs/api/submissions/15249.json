Im starting to see why your friend didn\u2019t have a job in the first place", "NTA \n\nThey show you how reliable they are, be grateful they don't work with you !", "NTA- honestly, do you have to ask? Dude obviously just wants the reward with none of the work, basically making you do it all for him. You need better friends.", "NTA. The thing about a job is they aren\u2019t going to just wait around until you are ready, because there are other applicants who have their shit together to apply on time.", "NTA. You put yourself on the line recommending someone who couldn\u2019t even be bothered sending an email at the first opportunity. Your friend is ungrateful. Don\u2019t help him out in a work sense again.", "NTA cos your friend seems like an irresponsible person since he waited a whole month, after you asked the hiring manager to hold the job positions for him and his gf, to call them and send in his resume to get the job.", "NTA\n\nYou did your part, he didn't do his", "NTA\n\nisn't he an adult? so be responsible for his apointments.", "Nta and BULLET. DODGED. This would have been a headache.", "NTA, if he was doing to drag his feet for 5 weeks, he'd likely have made you look bad for even recommending him as that kind of \"go-getter\" attitude no doubt would show in his work performance. Holding a position for a couple of days or maybe a week is one thing - keeping two positions open for over a month is an entirely different kettle of fish.", "NTA in the slightest, he had his chance over a good amount of time and he chose not to act on it. However I'd say he's a HUGE AH for blaming you for his lack of ability to do a simple thing", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
