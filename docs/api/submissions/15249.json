Dude obviously just wants the reward with none of the work, basically making you do it all for him. You need better friends.", "NTA. The thing about a job is they aren\u2019t going to just wait around until you are ready, because there are other applicants who have their shit together to apply on time.", "NTA. You put yourself on the line recommending someone who couldn\u2019t even be bothered sending an email at the first opportunity. Your friend is ungrateful. Don\u2019t help him out in a work sense again.", "NTA cos your friend seems like an irresponsible person since he waited a whole month, after you asked the hiring manager to hold the job positions for him and his gf, to call them and send in his resume to get the job.", "NTA\n\nYou did your part, he didn't do his", "NTA\n\nisn't he an adult? so be responsible for his apointments.", "Nta and BULLET. DODGED. This would have been a headache.", "NTA, if he was doing to drag his feet for 5 weeks, he'd likely have made you look bad for even recommending him as that kind of \"go-getter\" attitude no doubt would show in his work performance. Holding a position for a couple of days or maybe a week is one thing - keeping two positions open for over a month is an entirely different kettle of fish.", "NTA in the slightest, he had his chance over a good amount of time and he chose not to act on it. However I'd say he's a HUGE AH for blaming you for his lack of ability to do a simple thing", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So I missed out on a real job with benefits while she got to work there, and she only worked there because she was mad at her dad for not letting her run his business without any qualifications while he paid for a company car and expenses. \nYou OTOH are emphatically NTA because your friend never bothered following through", "I think sometimes it's important to remember that a job application- the piece of paper- can act like a de nimimus test to see will someone at least do the bare basics of work.\n\nIt answers the question of \"will someone at least apply for the job on their own.\" Not their mom, dad, sibling or SO filling out the application. But them.\n\nYou're definitely NTA but when suggesting friends for positions in the future, it's important to ask yourself- would they actually represent you well when they are doing the job? \n\nand if they answer is that you aren't 100%, or at least 98%, don't suggest them for the position.", "NTA.", "NTA. You also probably avoided having to fire him later, which would have been even more awkward.

I recommended a friend for a job years ago, she was hired, and she turned out to be awful at the job. It definitely reflected back on me that the person I\u2019d vouched for was crap.
