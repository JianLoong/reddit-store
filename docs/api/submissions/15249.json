You put yourself on the line recommending someone who couldn\u2019t even be bothered sending an email at the first opportunity. Your friend is ungrateful. Don\u2019t help him out in a work sense again.", "NTA cos your friend seems like an irresponsible person since he waited a whole month, after you asked the hiring manager to hold the job positions for him and his gf, to call them and send in his resume to get the job.", "NTA\n\nYou did your part, he didn't do his", "NTA\n\nisn't he an adult? so be responsible for his apointments.", "Nta and BULLET. DODGED. This would have been a headache.", "NTA, if he was doing to drag his feet for 5 weeks, he'd likely have made you look bad for even recommending him as that kind of \"go-getter\" attitude no doubt would show in his work performance. Holding a position for a couple of days or maybe a week is one thing - keeping two positions open for over a month is an entirely different kettle of fish.", "NTA in the slightest, he had his chance over a good amount of time and he chose not to act on it.

So I missed out on a real job with benefits while she got to work there, and she only worked there because she was mad at her dad for not letting her run his business without any qualifications while he paid for a company car and expenses. \nYou OTOH are emphatically NTA because your friend never bothered following through", "I think sometimes it's important to remember that a job application- the piece of paper- can act like a de nimimus test to see will someone at least do the bare basics of work.\n\nIt answers the question of \"will someone at least apply for the job on their own.\" Not their mom, dad, sibling or SO filling out the application. But them.\n\nYou're definitely NTA but when suggesting friends for positions in the future, it's important to ask yourself- would they actually represent you well when they are doing the job? \n\nand if they answer is that you aren't 100%, or at least 98%, don't suggest them for the position.", "NTA.", "NTA. You also probably avoided having to fire him later, which would have been even more awkward. He doesn\u2019t sound like the type of guy who would have been a stellar employee if he couldn\u2019t even get his act together to send one email. \n\nI think this is a lesson everyone learns at some point. I recommended a friend for a job years ago, she was hired, and she turned out to be awful at the job. It definitely reflected back on me that the person I\u2019d vouched for was crap. I will never again refer anyone to a job who I don\u2019t think will actually be good at it.", "NTA. He can't even send an email! What kind of employee he would be? You dodged a bullet.", "Are you sure that your friend didn\u2019t do that on purpose?", "That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for man! \ud83d\ude02", "I dunno, she was legitimately surprised that I was angry", "She sounds like a piece of work either way.", "Yeah, way past self-centered.", "nta he's a bum", "NTA at all. I would\u2019ve reiterated that he was told about the job almost a month and a half ago and asked if he really thought they wouldn\u2019t have filled the position by now. You were much nicer than I would be about it.", "NTA, it is not your job to hold jobs for them, or make sure they follow up. You did what you had to and more, it is on your friend and his girlfriend, they are adults.", "NTa, but this is a good lesson to never mix work with family/friends. It almost always ends badly. I've seen it happen way too many times.", "NTA - you were doing them a huge favor and they left you hanging. You did the right thing by letting the hiring manager take care of actual business, since your friends couldn't get their shit together.", "NTA you gave him plenty of time and reminders, he is an adult he should be taking care it himself.", "NTA, it took him a week after to call mad.", "NTA- Your friend showed the job how reliable he really is. Personal anecdote; I vouched for a friend for a job once, and will never again. They came in and proceeded to not do/do the opposite of everything needed, and instead of being corrected, management came down *on me.* \"You said he was dependable!\" \"You said he could do the job!\"", "Yeah, NTA. But OP learned the hard way not to recommend friends for a job.\n\nI used a friends name once and only once. I almost didn\u2019t get the job. She was my friend outside of work but she was an awful associate, a fact that I had to admit to during the interview\u2014 that we had never worked together and only knew each other outside of work. The manager at the time basically in short told me that they almost didn\u2019t call me back but that I was persistent and I interviewed well. \n\nThe friend whose name I gave to get the job? She marched right up to another associate and asked if he was gay. He reported her and she got put on \u201cprobation\u201d aka fired. I ended up going over to her place around Xmas, three weeks after this happened and she was continually asking me if I knew when she was getting her job back. I had to pull her aside and tell her that the managers have said flat out that she was not coming back to work and that she was fired and her name wasn\u2019t on the schedule. \n\nShe got upset and our friendship wasn\u2019t the same after that. She didn\u2019t think she should\u2019ve been fired for asking that question because she was \u201coff the clock\u201d even though she was in uniform. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "THIS! I once recommended a friend for a job at a company I used to work for and he was constantly late and did his job poorly. Co-workers basically made fun of me for recommending such an incompetent person. Always tread that line carefully from here on out", "NTA, and get new, better friends", "NTA someone who can't even manage to send an email for a job within a month, plus a whole additional week, is not going to be a reliable employee, and would not have reflected great on you if you suggested they're hired.\n\nYou gave him plenty of time, and he's a grown adult, I assume, so you did your part, he failed to do his, he lost them both the jobs.  Hopefully someone else who does good work and needs and appreciates the job gets it.", "NTA. I was like your friend at one point. Had a job lined up, good money, good schedule, all I had to do was put in my resume. I didn't, and didn't get the job. My anger was from guilt and shame that I'd been so stupid to miss that chance. It's a needed lesson, and one I hope your friend learns.", "NTA\n\nDoing a favour for a friend is one thing, but should you decide to do this again (for a different friend) then put a deadline on it right from the start in an email and don't hold it open for them as long as you have.\n\nIf they were applying for any other job there would be a deadline for applications.", "NTA.

He was starting to make you look like one in your place of work but you out a stop to it which was the right move.  \n\nYou can lead a horse to water but you can\u2019t make them drink.", "Exactly! OP even did more by having the positions \u2018held\u2019 for a few weeks but the friend couldn\u2019t even send an email. \n\nNTA", "The guy couldn't even send an email to get himself easily employed - no way he was going to do a decent job, and probably wouldn't even show up.  Definitely a dodged bullet.", "NTA\n\nHe did it to himself.  He didn\u2019t bother to call or email when told to, so the job was awarded.  That happens when someone doesn\u2019t follow through.  \n\nHe is the AH here, for not taking responsibility for his own actions.", "NTA - You arranged the job, your friend ignored it at your and your reputation's expense. I'd also be reticent to call someone with similar behavior as anything more than colleague.", "Why are you even friends with this person? You practically giftwrapped them a job if they did the bare minimum for the job, snubs it for a month, which makes YOU look bad, and then pitches a baby fit when they finally put it through?\n\nI think you need a new friend."]}
