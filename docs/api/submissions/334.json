Libby has always been a very opinionated kid and generally, she got along well with the girls, but over the last year her opinionated nature was more controlling and more pushy. She always wanted to say what they would do, she would tell the girls what to like and what not to like, she would go as far as trying to make them stop liking something because she didn't like it. I had worked with my daughter on how to address it. I had even spoken to Libby's parents a few times when Libby was being particularly pushy and upsetting my daughter. In the end nothing changed and it kept getting worse. The last day all four girls were together Indie's parents along with my husband and I had taken the girls to a water park and Libby had decided what slides they could and couldn't go on and complained when she was told she wasn't in charge. Then when Calia and Reece enjoyed a ride, she told the girls they hadn't enjoyed it and it was a stupid ride. The day ended with her telling the girls to tell \"the parents\" that they wanted to eat at McDonald's instead of getting pizza and when they said that wasn't true, she pushed and pushed until two of the girls were crying. I took her back to her parents and the friendship was done.\n\nYesterday I took Calia, Indie and Reece to a Halloween party at our local park and we ran into Libby and her parents. Libby was upset she wasn't invited and her parents confronted me about not taking Libby. I told them Libby was no longer their friend and wasn't invited because she's a bad friend, who tries to control the girls.

Nowadays I actually have a spine and I\u2019m not so easily bossed around. My point is, your daughter, Indie and Reece should not have to be friends with a girl who pushes them around. Tell them that it\u2019s good they\u2019re standing up for themselves, and encourage the three of them to stay together.

I was proactive though; I intervened when I saw him doing it, ie \"everyone gets to have a say not just you\" and warned him after his friends left that people don't like to be bossed around and they wouldn't want to play with him if it wasn't fun for them. He didn't stop for a while and some of his friends didn't come over as much. \n\nI never questioned their right to avoid obnoxious behavior... and the fact that they reacted exactly the way I predicted made an impression on him.

Even at 8, kids know how to compromise, how to share and that one person telling everyone else what they're supposed  to feel or think is wrong. If they don't, you usually don't have to look very much farther than the people raising them to see where the problem is. \n\nNTA", "Did you tell the girls that Libby wasn't their friend or did they decide it for themselves?", "NTA. Yes, Libby is learning and got a valuable lesson her parents refused to teach her.

Eight is absolutely the age we\u2019re you\u2019d want to stop shitty behavior like that.", ">*Libby's parents said she's 8 and is learning*\n\nThis would be great if they were actually teaching her anything, but from your story they're just letting her behave how she wants with zero parental guidance.

I gave them a few ways to let this kid down gently about the friendship, because it wasn't my place to interfere between them.

That was fun.", "NTA \n\nYou tried to work with Libby's parents with 0 improvement. After a certain point as a parent, you have to make executive decisions about some things to protect your kid.", "NTA. Not inviting a kid to an event is normal and isn't doing anything to her.

Have no doubt they are all the same.", "NTA\n\nLibbie maybe eight years old and learning but your child and her friends are not items to be used in Libbie's socialisation training - they are humans, with their own rights and needs.

There really was no other alternative than to eliminate Libby from the friend circle.", "NTA my daughter had a friend like this Dane situation. My daughter didn\u2019t put up with her crap, another friend was too timid abs took the brunt of it then. Her mom didn\u2019t step up like you did. You did the right thing. In my situation that girl bounded from friend groups to friends group but seems to have finally gotten her act together.", "Libby\u2019s parents are ignoring that their daughter is a controlling manipulative bully. Her repeated horrible behaviour came with the consequences of lost friendships. Her parents are entitled to think she should still be included when she bullies. This could have been a valuable learning opportunity for Libby about her actions and the consequences but instead her parents have enabled her to believe there is nothing wrong with being controlling and abusive and that consequences don\u2019t apply to her. NTA.", "NTA, she maybe needs a temporary \"timeout\" from the friend group. This might give her the opportunity to learn that being a pushy brat doesn't work in the real world and that others have feelings too.

It teaches us what is deemed acceptable so we are forced to decide, behave appropriately or be unwelcome. That girl's parents are doing her no favours.
