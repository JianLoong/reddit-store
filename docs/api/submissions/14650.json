You just asked him to take off his shoes, not to strip naked. \n\nYour mom sounds awesome, btw.", "NTA.\n\nI'll give you a quick story: my late Dad was one of those people who would flip channels on television constantly. It was not one of those things where it was every ten seconds or so, instead, he'd wait a few minutes, then pick up the remote and change the channel. \n\nYou couldn't watch TV with him because you'd never really see anything. Sit down with him, he'd put on a nature show about spiders in Madagascar or something. Well, I don't really care about Malagasy arachnids, but those shows can make them interesting. CLICK! Then it was an old movie. Ah, well, I haven't seen this one in a long time...CLICK!  You get the picture.\n\nOne day Dad comes over for a visit. I was watching some sporting event or something, and it was the end of a close game, and he picks up the remote and CLICK we're watching a cooking show. @#@!!!\n\nAnyway, I grabbed the remote, put it back to what I had been watching and told him \"my house, MY RULES!\"  You should have seen the look on his face. Shocked, then he started laughing. I turned around something he had said for years to me and my sisters before we all moved out and used it against him.\n\nHe never did that again, not at my place.\n\nYour house, your rules. Never forget that.", "NTA \n\nIt was such a simple request and his overreaction to it tells me that he's not accustomed to not being the \"man of the house\".", "NTA.  Is asking Mexican men to take their shoes off a cultural offense?\n\nI suppose you could try to entice him with slippers in his size to make him comfortable if you want; extend an olive branch if you will, but I gotta think there is some past event that is triggering him.  It isn't customary in every house, but it is common enough that this cant be the first time he has been asked to take his shoes off.\n\nCongrats on the house.", "NTA Your request was completely reasonable!", "NTA - The concept of wearing outside shoes in the house never made sense to me. Why would you want to track dirt and mud all over the floor?\n\nWhen entering someone\u2019s home, you have to respect their rules within reason. Taking off shoes before stepping on the carpet is a reasonable rule. Your dad was way out of line, and very selfish to sacrifice his relationship with his daughter over something as trivial as shoes. I\u2019m glad your mom at least had your back. \n\nHas your dad done things like this before? Is it an issue where he wants to be the one in control and can\u2019t handle being told what to do? Or is this something new that happened because you have your own house?", "NTA. I hate when people refuse to respect other people's house rules. Especially when its not an outrageous request.", "NTA, how is this even a question?  You should have said \"Dad, my house, my rules.\"", "NTA.\n\nHe's overreacting. Just take off your shoes! It's your house your rules. If he wants to be a baby about it then let him not come over, it's a stupid reason but maybe he'll come to his senses.", "NTA many, if not most people have a no shoes policy.  I don't think it's a big deal at all to ask your own parents to do that.", "NTA Most of the world doesn't wear shoes in the house. It is BASIC cleanliness and etiquette to take shoes off. Your father is being unreasonable. You have every right to keep.your house clean. It doesn't sound as if it will be much of a loss if he doesn't visit. You can visit with your mother in peace. Win-win.", "NTA. That is a very normal request. However, if you want to salvage your relationship with your family, maybe offer an alternative like disposable shoe covers they can put on when they arrive. It\u2019s not your job to meet in the middle, but sometimes we make sacrifices and compromises for those we love.", "NTA - I wear shoes in the house, but as compared to the rest of the world, that is considered very very odd. I always take my shoes off if requested.", "NTA and I don't see how you could be.", "NTA, your house, your rules.", "NTA. As your mom said, your house, your rules. I always take my shoes off (and keep house shoes by the door) because it's more hygienic and also helps your floors stay cleaner.", "NTA at all. I dont understand how it is acceptable anywhere to wear your shoes inside someone's house and track shit everywhere. Thank god its the cultural norm around here to take shoes off before entering the house.", "Your house, your rules.", "My son and his partner purchased their new home and have the same rule. My son is white but his partner is Vietnamese and this is a standard in their culture. I respect their wishes in their home. NTA. Your house, your rules.", "Tell us you make your wife do the housework without telling us you make your wife do the housework...\n\nNTA. Your dad however...", "NTA my son (also 26) has me take off my shoes AND wash my hands when I come in. It\u2019s his house, so I do it.", "NTA  Response: okay, bye!", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m Japanese and in my family shoes NEVER get worn inside. And that\u2019s something I prefer too. I explain this to anyone who visits me ahead of time. For people who visit I even let them store indoor shoes or flip flops at my home and I have them ready  at the door for when they arrive.", "NTA  \n\n\nperfectly acceptable rule, even for non-carpeted floors actually.    plus its not like he would be cleaning up his mess, or hiring someone to do it (And i would hesitate to believe him even if he did offer but still give him at least 1 chance)", "NTA-his reaction is bizarre. Hopefully, he didn't mean what he said.", "Nta- ah ,good ol\u2019 machismo culture. \n\nYour mom cracks me up.  \n\nYour dad will get over it .", "NTA.  Your house, your rules.  If they want to visit, they follow your rules.", "NTA ahhh\u2026this reminds of the time I asked my Colombian grandmother to buckle up when I was driving and wouldn\u2019t move until she did. I was 16 and a new driver. She got so mad said, \u201cI am not senile!\u201d Then attempted to get out of the car to walk home\u2026.I miss that little spitfire \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nI have a no shoes in my home rule as well and my kids are good at enforcing it with people that come over too.

Wearing shoes you\u2019ve worn outdoors inside a house, regardless of whether it\u2019s carpeted or not, is gross. Even more so when you\u2019re a guest in someone\u2019s house and they\u2019ve politely explained their house rules to you.", "I'm going to be down voted to oblivion here, and I get that. \n\nI do not take off my shoes for anything except bed. Shoes belong on feet. Feet belong on floors. Floors get walked on. Shoes are wiped on the door mat. The mat removes dirt from the shoes before entering the house. Floors get swept and mopped daily. Floors are fairly clean. Stocking feet are painful to walk in- there's no cushion between your foot and the floor. It's quite painful and cold. Before someone tells me to just wear slippers, thank you, but no. Slippers literally slip everywhere, and I don't like falling down. \n\nThe only bare feet in this house are dog and cat feet. \n\nI would much rather have a little dirt to sweep up than have to smell stinky feet and look at disgusting toes. And why would you want to get your socks all dirty and then put dirty socks into clean shoes? Why would you want foot stink and sweat on your floors? \n\nI would not be comfortable with being required to take off my shoes, so I wouldn't stay. I certainly wouldn't be an ass about it, but I would decline to visit or enter the home if the host insisted that I remove my shoes. \n\nNo judgment here, just wanted to share a different point of view.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
