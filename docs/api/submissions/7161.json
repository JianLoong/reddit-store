My 40th birthday is today, actually, but we celebrated it last Saturday for somewhat obvious reasons, and this Saturday isn't good for us all.\n\nMy wife and I invited several of our and her friends. It was a strictly no kids 18+ party, so we sent our kids to spend the day with their friends. While most of the guest got the message, one didn't.\n\nEnter one of my wife's friends: Jane Doe (not her actual name). She brought her eight year old child, despite the invitation saying \"NO KIDS ALLOWED\" in big, red letters. We didn't have a place to put the kids, so we reminded her of the disclaimer and said she had to either hire a babysitter, or watch her child herself (by the way she's a single mother, her boyfriend left her when the baby was concieved and she refused to get an abortion). She said that she couldn't afford a babysitter and really wanted to go to my party, and that I was being \"inconsiderate\". Without thinking, I blurted out \"Inconsiderate of what? That you are a selfish bitch who is willing to take an eight-year-old to an adult-oriented party, simply because you can't afford a babysitter?\" Keep in mind, this party is an adults-only party for a reason. There's swearing, alcohol, sex themes, basically anything you can think of that kids shouldn't be exposed to.\n\nJane told me I was the one who was selfish and slammed the door. My wife was infuriated. She scolded me for kicking out Jane, telling me that I should have just let her bring her child in. I told her no because it's my party, and if I don't want to invite kids, I shouldn't have to.\n\nSo guys, AITA?\n\nEDIT: Since so, so many people clearly can't read, let me get something straight: No, I was not shaming her for refusing to get an abortion. I was trying to explain that the child didn't have a father because the father left Jane BECAUSE she refused to get an abortion. How do people make this mistake? Good lord. I hope this clears things up, because this is absolutely ridiculous how so many people read this wrong. The younger generation really is dumber. Sorry I had to insult your intelligence, but this is very infuriating.\n\nEDIT 2: The reason why I called her selfish was because she chose a party over her kid. Sometimes you have to make sacrifices. I did that with my kids.", "created_utc": 1673547631, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10a6k13/aita_for_kicking_one_of_my_wifes_friends_out_of/", "score": 2085, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

ESH.", "Maybe because the term single mom doesn't imply the father is not present in the child's life. Single as in not in a couple and mother as being the kid's mom. \n\nIt also sounds more like the father suggested abortion and the mother declined. Which is what refusal is. \n\nI don't think OPs reaction was warranted, but a lot of people seem to be making it a lot worse than it actually is because of how he tried to give context. The context being that the father isn't in the child's life. Did we need to know about why he's not there? Not really.", "\ud83d\ude06", "Lol Probably like adult board games", "An a-hole", "He very well could be. It reads like the content warnings on TV. *OP's party is rated NC-17 for foul language, alcohol consumption, and sex themes*", "If that is the case, he got hammered today as well considering how he responses to the comments and the party itself was 5 days ago. Or, he's one of those people where it takes a week to sober up...?", "I think he shared all that to give us more reasons to hate on Jane.", "Yeah\u2026. I\u2019m older than he is and I read it as \u201cdaddy dipped and she refused to get an abortion\u201d not \u201cdaddy dipped *because* she refused to get an abortion.\u201d\n\nI mean, I didn\u2019t take it as \u201cshaming\u201d her for not getting an abortion, but the phrasing was odd.", "Exactly. If I say \u201cI like to ride my bike and eat sandwiches\u201d, I GUESS you could interpret it as I like to eat sandwiches while on my bike, but there are much clearer ways to word that to get that point across. No need to insult everyone younger than you as if your inability to write clearly is some indication of the overall intelligence of the younger generation.", "I giggled.", "Why no \"Happy Birthday! We just stopped by to say hi and give you a hug\" option?", "\"Maybe because the term single mom doesn't imply the father is not present in the child's life. Single as in not in a couple and mother as being the kid's mom.\"\n\nTrue, so all he had to say was the dad isn't in the picture and she can't afford a sitter. That communicates the point without giving us a paragraph on the circumstances from nearly a decade ago that led to being a single mom. None of that had bearing on the story.\n\nAnd from where I sit, the reason I'm reacting so strongly is bc he not only gave us so much unnecessary back story -- with the kind of details society loves to judge -- he combined it with misogynistic name calling.", "Not necessarily. I\u2019ve read a lot of posts here where people don\u2019t think information is pertinent (even though it is) and they don\u2019t add it.", "OP has united the generations.", "He's also so caught up in the 'and/because' drama he is not getting the central point of the fact that he mentioned any of this for the purpose of this story seems judgmental and a red flag- like when someone mentions a person's race in story where it doesn't belong.  The kid is 8. Why he wasn't aborted is not at issue in this story ( even if the mother didn't fully think through that she have to miss out on OP's birthday party at some stage if she went through with the pregnancy) yikes man", "Funny, him trashing younger generations. Reading his comments from a now deleted post, his thirteen year old daughter got caught vandalizing school grounds with antisemitic slurs with her friends.\u2026.. \n\nHis wife defended the daughter so he and her added to the degradaption of the gene pool imo. But I\u2019ll take stupid over antisemite any day.", "\"Sorry I had to insult your intelligence, but this is very infuriating.\" is the kicker. He had to do no such thing, insulting everyone's intelligence was a choice he made. It makes me wonder what else he finds himself \"forced\" to do to keep the people in his life in line.", "His edits made me immediately go that he's TA.", "I suppose. I still firmly believe this is a shit post written by a teenager who is imaging what adult birthday parties are like and how 40 year olds behave, but you are right that it\u2019s possible to forget pertinent info.\n\nI\u2019m early 40\u2019s, and I know many early 40\u2019s people, and none are having sex themed 40th bday parties full of swearing and screaming at people in front of their children. None of this screams normal 40 year old real life behaviour. This is adult life as imagined by a 16 year old redditor.", "I like how you phrased this as if you were personally at an awkward daytime sex party and it was classless ha.", "He honestly is cause I'm seeing a lot of people OP's age and older who think he's a stupid asshole", "Yeah, he says the kid has no father because she refused an abortion. The reality is the kid has no father because the father chose to not be involved. Way to blame the woman.", "Maybe it's actually quite clear, and he just doesn't like what that means. I think he wrote exactly as he intended it, he just expected more people to have the same view of his childish behavior towards another grown ass adult.", ":D"]}
