My 40th birthday is today, actually, but we celebrated it last Saturday for somewhat obvious reasons, and this Saturday isn't good for us all.\n\nMy wife and I invited several of our and her friends. It was a strictly no kids 18+ party, so we sent our kids to spend the day with their friends. While most of the guest got the message, one didn't.\n\nEnter one of my wife's friends: Jane Doe (not her actual name). She brought her eight year old child, despite the invitation saying \"NO KIDS ALLOWED\" in big, red letters. We didn't have a place to put the kids, so we reminded her of the disclaimer and said she had to either hire a babysitter, or watch her child herself (by the way she's a single mother, her boyfriend left her when the baby was concieved and she refused to get an abortion). She said that she couldn't afford a babysitter and really wanted to go to my party, and that I was being \"inconsiderate\". Without thinking, I blurted out \"Inconsiderate of what? That you are a selfish bitch who is willing to take an eight-year-old to an adult-oriented party, simply because you can't afford a babysitter?\" Keep in mind, this party is an adults-only party for a reason. There's swearing, alcohol, sex themes, basically anything you can think of that kids shouldn't be exposed to.\n\nJane told me I was the one who was selfish and slammed the door. My wife was infuriated. She scolded me for kicking out Jane, telling me that I should have just let her bring her child in. I told her no because it's my party, and if I don't want to invite kids, I shouldn't have to.\n\nSo guys, AITA?\n\nEDIT: Since so, so many people clearly can't read, let me get something straight: No, I was not shaming her for refusing to get an abortion. I was trying to explain that the child didn't have a father because the father left Jane BECAUSE she refused to get an abortion. How do people make this mistake? Good lord. I hope this clears things up, because this is absolutely ridiculous how so many people read this wrong. The younger generation really is dumber. Sorry I had to insult your intelligence, but this is very infuriating.\n\nEDIT 2: The reason why I called her selfish was because she chose a party over her kid. Sometimes you have to make sacrifices. I did that with my kids.", "created_utc": 1673547631, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10a6k13/aita_for_kicking_one_of_my_wifes_friends_out_of/", "score": 664, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Theres a lot of parents out there who would do the same thing as her, but most would either stay home with their kid, or find someone who can help you out in a pinch. \n\nDid Jane not have a single friend or family member who would be willing to help her out so she could go to her friends party? Even if OP allowed her to stay, I would love to know what Janes reaction would have been when one of the sex games started and her kid was there....", "Right? None of why she has a child matters. There was no need for that. She should not have brought a child, and not only is he not an asshole for wanting her to leave, even if there wasn't anything particularly adult oriented going on, the invitation said no kids. What he said to her, and what he says about her here are out if line.", "His SO invited her to his birthday party... why did he not ask her to handle it?  I find that curious...", "Oh yes I do class OP as an AH. My judgement would be ESH", "well, you are a good spouse.", "he was probably zooted on cocaine and hammered thats my only logical explanation for how he spoke to her", "What really makes him TA is her called her a selfish bitch in front of her 8 year old son. Who does that?", "Indeed/ so he should have written \u2018because\u2019 not  \u2018and\u2019.  Instead he got all pissy and wrote an insulting edit to all the people who read it exactly as he wrote it. Because- check notes- he is an asshole.", "Nah, it's even worse. The father apparently left during the conception.\n\n>her boyfriend left her when the baby was concieved", "It's what he meant, but it's weird to even mention. She's a single mom because she wouldn't get an abortion? But if she got an abortion, she wouldn't have been a mom anyway. Like duh, it just adds nothing for context. Instead it comes off like, \"she wouldn't listen to the man in the relationship, so she deserves this.\"", "I read the first sentence and thought \u201cit\u201d meant the kid. I read that as \u201cthere are single moms that kill the kid on their own (like my mom)\u201d and I was genuinely so confused for a moment", "Why would you use the term \u201ckilling\u201d YAH.", "English is not my first language.... Can you explain me the difference between what he wrote about the abortion and what he meant? To me it sounds the same ... Like an AH", "Can't pay for a babysitter one time that we know of \u2260 can't take care of her kid. There's a mile of nuance to jump over to reach the conclusion that the kid should have been aborted.", "Abortions exist so people can do to adult only parties?", "It \u201crationalises\u201d  (I don\u2019t think it does but that\u2019s why it\u2019s there) why she went against the rules. Because she\u2019s got specifically those circumstances she really wants a party and can\u2019t afford childcare.", "Agreed. I would have asked her to leave if it were my party honestly and I would have been mad to even be put in the situation where I need to ask someone to leave my house..\n\nbut OP exposed himself as an asshole simply by telling a story and speaking lol", "No but the fact that it was under THOSE circumstances is the reason why she can\u2019t afford sitter and is desperate for a party and some time for herself.", "Because it is the reason why she can\u2019t afford sitter and is desperate for a party and some time for herself.", "That last paragraph of yours is really perceptive. I\u2019ve understood a lot from that and it really does make sense that that\u2019s what people would think.", "I don't see anywhere in the posts that indicate this was done in front of the child.\n\nIf it did... I still don't have a problem with it. If his only fault in this is his choice of descriptors then she still shoulders the vast majority of the blame if only for being willing to use her child to get what she wants.  It isn't OP's job to shield that entitled person's child from the reality that she is a bitch.\n\nDo bitch things... get called a bitch.", "Calling someone a selfish bitch (in front of their kid no less) is not a normal reaction to this situation.", "Her *choice.*", "it's absolutely outrageous to bring an 8 year to a 40-year-old's birthday party and have the 8-year-old be the only kid there but whine about being asked to leave. What the hell is the kid going to do the whole time there?", "I think the wife is angry because she its her friend and I bet the wife told Jane it would be okay to bring the kid and they both tried to ambush him.", "I was on his side but he lost me the second he started to talk about her like that. I don't even know why we're responding to this post because he does not sound like a man who'll admit his wrongs in this situation.", "To me it read more as an explanation of her current financial state and served as an explanation as to why she felt entitled to bring her 8 year old kid to an adults-only party", "Yeah the edit made him look like an even bigger AH.", "Even with the edit you\u2019re still the AH", "English is not my first language.... Can you explain me the difference between what he wrote about the abortion and what he meant? To me it sounds the same ... Like an A...", "That is some split-second timing!", "I can definitely see how it\u2019s taken that way. \n\nI use the phrase so often that I didn\u2019t even realize how it would come across given the topic.", "Because it's an idiom... If I'm \"killing it\" with cooking I'm doing really well at cooking. The person before you was just saying their mom is good at being a single parent.", "Because when you abort a baby you kill a life. Using different language to justify your stance on abortion is a cowardly thing to do. I'm pro-choice, but I acknowledge that it ends a life.", "The way he wrote it sounds like the boyfriend bailed and she refused advice from multiple people to have an abortion. \n\nWhat he meant was the boyfriend left her _because_ she refused his pressure to have an abortion. \n\nHe\u2019s just mad because people are calling him out on his ambiguous wording.", "According to this AH.", "Nah mate, if you can\u2019t get a babysitter or know not to bring a baby to an ADULT party, maybe an abortion is for you", "Pretty sure \"she's a single parent\" covers it", "And??? Boy, women really can't win with you folks. Insulted and harassed for getting an abortion, insulted and harassed for not getting one.", "not questioning thay. Just saying that he shouldn't have treat her that way. And this is coming from someone who has being know as rude her whole life. And I try to change everyday. She was wrong, but so was he. That's why I say ESH", "Well in all fairness I would be furious if my bf spoke to one of my friends like that or even the other way tbh, but everyone's definitely the asshole here in one way or another. I also have been in these situations myself and based on those experiences, I agree with your suspicion that the wife approved it....", "\"She's a single mom\" is an explanation of her financial situation. \"She refused to get an abortion\" when the child is 8? That's not an explanation of her financial situation, it's an explanation of why he's an AH to her.", "Absolutely. I'm the same age as OP so decidedly not \"the younger generation\" and I misunderstood what he meant when I first read it cause his wording is really vague. It for sure should have been phrased as because or when. \n\nHe left her and she refused reads as two different unrelated events. \n\nHe left her because she refused / he left her when she refused reads as cause and effect. \n\nCalling us all stupid for his inability to write clearly is both Asshole-ish and childish.", "The edits just helped verify that any and all AH judgements are spot-on.", "So he wrote\n\nSingle mum because dad left when baby conceived \u2018and\u2019 she refuse to get an abortion-  \n\nso quick read makes it sound like two different things-  ie. She got pregnant, boyf left so now she is pregnant and single  and then refused to get an abortion = single mum. It is probably grammatically correct but the causality isn\u2019t as clear. \n\nWhereas: \n\nSingle mum as boyfriend left when she got pregnant \u2018because\u2019 she refused to get an abortion.  Just really clear boyfriend didn\u2019t just leave or leave because she was pregnant, it was the refusal to get an abortion. \n\nStill pretty callous to bring up eight years later, the fact of why she is a single mum is relevant at all and the ex-boyfriend still a deadbeat if can\u2019t parent whilst she goes to a party but hey!", "Because indicates a linkage between the two things. Like because I don\u2019t like fish I don\u2019t like sushi.

I apologize for the mistake.", "idk if you read the comment theyre replying to but the first commentor was talking about abortions, \u201ckilling it\u201d was in reference to aborting a fetus", "But what's the difference. Why is he saying that at all... Does it matter why he left her... To me it sounds always like he is judging her for not having the abortion... But maybe that's the language barrier...", "He said he asked her to leave and instead of going she said she couldn't afford a babysitter and he was being inconsiderate. At what point can he just go get the hell out of my house never?", "Fair enough, that\u2019s just not how I perceived it.", "No, you are correct. He is judging her for not having an abortion, despite what he claims in the edit. All of the information about why she is a single mother is irrelevant and he\u2019s using it as a way to try and justify his behavior towards her."]}
