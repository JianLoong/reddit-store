{"id": 420, "submission_id": "yi10mg", "title": "AITA for staying late at a Halloween party when my bf wasn't having a good time?", "selftext": "Last night, my bf and I went to a Halloween party that started at 5pm.  I had estimated going home around 11-12ish.  We ended up staying until about 1:15am and my bf was upset because he was ready to leave and was waiting in the car while I took some silly pictures with my bff.\n\nI don't think I am the AH and here's why:\n\nMy bf is not a big partier - he doesn't drink much, doesn't partake in any other party favors, has an adverse reaction to cigarette/weed smoke, and typically doesn't stay up that late.  He had decided not to go, which was fine with me.  I had committed to going and running the sound for the night several weeks ago.  Then yesterday, he changed his mind and said he wanted to go.  I told him I was worried that he wouldn't enjoy it, because there were going to be people smoking and drinking, I'd be busy most of the time, and he wasn't going to know anyone else there.  He still chose to go.\n\nWe decided that if he got bored or uncomfortable, he'd just leave and pick me up later, or I'd Uber home.  Everything was fine and he didn't end up leaving early and didn't seem miserable.  I got a little tipsy and lost track of time.  When we decided it was time to leave, we packed up my gear and went inside.  I decided I was hungry and ate a little, then had to help my bff with her costume in the bathroom, then we took some silly pictures, so it took a while to get out the door.\n\nI knew something was up when he just texted \"Home\" when he got back from dropping me off - usually it would be something more along the  lines of \"I'm home baby \\[heart emoji\\]\".  So this morning, the accusations started flying.  First, it was inconsiderate to the neighbors to have been playing music that late (I was set up outside; the host didn't express any concern), and when he suggested a mellow last song, I said no and kept going (I was mostly running karaoke and there were a lot of participants).  Second, he said he had been waiting in the car while I took my time leaving.  He said I made him feel unimportant.  I don't think I had even realized he'd gone out to the car but my memory is a little foggy.\n\nHe then went on to say that he didn't have a good time, was bored by 7:30, everyone was smoking...so I gently reminded him of the plan that he could leave.  He thought it would have been rude to the host (I doubt she would have cared).  This was exactly what I was trying to avoid when we made that plan.\n\nI might be the AH for not picking up on his desire to leave sooner, and for dilly-dallying on the way out, but I feel I sufficiently warned him that it wasn't his scene.

You were drunk and rude and he was miserable and shouldn't have gone.", "ESH. He sucks for not just ubering home and blaming it on you, but you suck for taking that long to leave the party. Like if you told him that you were going to go with him, that gives you like 5 minutes. You should have both agreed on a time and then left. Also, if you were drunk enough that you lost track of time, he might not have felt comfortable leaving you there alone for your own safety, which is something to consider when you talk to him about this.", "> I had estimated going home around 11-12ish.

He doesn't get to complain about not leaving sooner when you made it clear he was free to do that at any time.  He *is* entitled to complain about thinking the two of you were on the same page about leaving, only for you to decide you needed a snack and a freaking photo shoot before that could happen.  That said, I don't know what he thinks he's accomplishing by sulking about it like this.  Is this the *only* aspect of your relationship where he's this much of a wet blanket, or is this part of a bigger personality mismatch?", "NTA. I am also not the party type or stay up late type (except in certain circumstances- like Halloween or with people I really know and love). But if everyone\u2019s boundaries were expressed beforehand and he had an exit strategy, I don\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t just take responsibility for himself and use it. You aren\u2019t his babysitter. \n\nIf this was an event that was solidly based around the two of you having a time together and you ditched him/didn\u2019t collaborate on the evening that would be different. But it seems like it was clear you were going to do your thing and he opted to go knowing his own aversions. His bad time, his own fault.", "I am like him not a party type I don\u2019t drink or smoke and I prefer to stay in at night but under no circumstances would I blame someone else if I decided to go to a party and was uncomfortable especially with the level of understanding and the amount of outs you gave him you are NTA", "NTA but would have been annoying for him. 5 to 1 is a long party. Personally I wouldn't wanted to have hung out with my gf friends for that long either especially not knowing anyone. I totally get it from his point especially if he's not drinking and you are, that's instantly more annoying for him. But ya NTA you were having fun and sounded like you Gabe him every opportunity to peace out. I would have been kind of annoyed that you had stayed out quite a but later than planned if he was picking you up at a certain time.", "NTA. I can see where he was probably coming from in that he wanted to go with you for a bit so you don\u2019t always have to go by yourself to these things. But, he knew what to expect. Yeah maybe you took a little too long leaving, but that\u2019s usually what happens at the end of the night. If this was a regular thing I could see why he\u2019d be upset. But I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong.", "NTA. He had his out and just chose to be pissy", "This idea that you need to make him feel important and validate him constantly is a serious red flag in my opinion. Why should you be responsible for his happiness? IMHO, he needs to find his own happiness and self-worth before embarking in a serious relationship. You need to never apologize again for not making him feel important (it felt creepy even typing that).", "Info needed...but NTA as far as I read....\n\nHow long have you two been dating??\n\nHe rightly decided not to go after you told him everything weeks ago.\n\nThe day before he changed his mind---- \nI would ask him and tell him to be honest-- Why did he change his mind about going to the party??\n\nAnd why didn't he just leave like the  backup plan you guys came up with??", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He went to a party that you had already indicated would be a situation where you would be 1. Busy 2. Somewhat late and 3. Well, partying. You didn't make him go and he had the option to leave. His behavior is unnecessary", "NTA. You made clear your intentions and gave him all of the understanding and room to be free to leave if he wasn't happy. If he said he was miserable but chose not to leave, that's on him, not you. In fact, it strikes me as though he stuck around to hold that over your head later. No matter the reason he stayed, he had choices and knew your plans so he only has himself to blame for his misery.\n\nEdit for clarification: The fact that he brought up he was having a bad time *before* you both decided to leave (when things were happening that he was pre-warned about) instead of focusing on how long you kept him waiting in the car is what sealed the deal for me in this being manipulative on his part.", "NTA. You made the expectations ABUNDANTLY clear, and even then, he chose to go anyway, making it impossible for you to \u201cmake him feel important\u201d. The major red flag here for me is that him still going when you pretty much tried to talk him out of going, probably because of how these things have gone in the past, he still insisted on going. Then, he didn\u2019t do what you planned: he didn\u2019t go home and get you later or have you Uber home. He set you up so that he could get upset with you so that you\u2019d be in this position to apologize and grovel. The very fact that you\u2019re on this forum and asking this question is part of the groveling he already has you doing. This is manipulative, controlling, and narcissist behavior. I would really rethink this relationship.", "Yes, I was ready also and needed to get back to my dogs.", "That's fair.  Thanks!", "I did apologize for being inconsiderate and taking too long, I was definitely in the wrong there.  He drove so he wouldn't have had to Uber, I would have if it had gotten too late for him to come back to pick me up (it's a short distance).  He didn't say anything about being concerned for my safety - it was a house I'd been to before with mostly people I'm acquainted with, and I often go out without him.  But to your point, bad things can happen anytime one's judgement is impaired so that may have been a factor.\n\nThanks!", "Judgement accepted, thanks.  Apology was made for being inconsiderate.  I've been on the other side of the wanting to go home fence and it's frustrating af to have to wait on someone's drunk ass taking their sweet time.", "It's symptomatic of differences in our personalities.  He's a self-proclaimed needy person and I'm not, which we've talked about extensively.  Other than that, we are a lot alike, but it could end up being a deal-breaker.\n\nThanks!", "It was definitely a long time, but only an hour later than the timeframe I'd estimated.\n\nHe said it was about what he'd expected, so it still doesn't make sense why he'd even go, or go and not leave when he'd had enough.\n\nThanks!", "Not a regular thing in this context but he is very sensitive & admittedly needy overall and I find myself apologizing a lot.  I jokingly said I need one of those signs that track how many days since an accident, but change it to how many days since I've apologized for something; he countered with he needs one for how many days since I made him feel unimportant.  That's never my intention ofc, and it makes me feel like I'm walking on egg shells sometimes.", "Yeah I have enough on my plate trying to find my own happiness, and don't want to be responsible for someone else's.", "We've been together for a year, with a couple short breakups.\n\nI'm really not sure why he changed his mind - could be that he just wanted to spend time together; I don't think it's a trust issue or anything.\n\nHe said he didn't want to abandon me, but it's not like it was a stranger's house filled with sketchy people, and he didn't want to risk being called a Grandpa (yes, I have called him Grandpa in jest; guess it bothered him more than I realized).", "Thanks, it's really helpful to have an outside perspective.  I have some soul-searching to do.", "I disagree. \nGetting upset at having to wait when someone tells you they are ready to leave is a perfectly valid reason to be upset.\nI believe some of the other things were probably said out of anger and it\u2019s pretty much a stretch to call it narcissistic behaviour especially since there is a very specific criteria to classify someone as a narcissist.", "Okay. Then gently, YTA for stringing him along. Bf was looking forward to going home, and you lost track of time and decided to eat too. That\u2019s something called \u201cmoving the goalpost\u201d. Not the worst thing to ever do, but I would apologize and make amends with bf. \n\nOtherwise you communicated solid boundaries and compromises before the party.", "I mean this seems like a situation where You should just both be able to apologize and learn from it and move on. It shouldn't be that big of a deal.", "Oh my mistake I thought it was about 4 hours later than discussed", "Well from the tiny sliver of your relationship that I\u2019m privy to, sounds like maybe you need to reevaluate the relationship. Seems like you guys want different things and are just a little too different. You shouldn\u2019t have to spend your life walking on egg shells around your significant other.", "Grandpa.?? Is there an age difference or just social differences??\n\nYou guys have multiple breaks?? That's usually a hard indicator for a relationship.. \n\nSaying he didn't want to abandon you *CAN* be a form of a trust issue/manipulation. Basically he doesn't trust your judgement/you to be able to handle whatever the situation you are in. He feels he needs to save you and have that control.", "Thanks, I did apologize for being inconsiderate.  I would have felt the same way if I were anxious to get home & had to sit there waiting, so I agree that was an AH thing to do.  I may have subconsciously felt entitled to stay as long as I wanted since I'd discouraged him from attending in the first place but that's not an excuse to be rude.", "Yeah, it's a potential deal-breaker.  We had very different childhoods, where his parents doted upon him & his brother and they could do no wrong; my folks were more hands-off and not particularly concerned about my self-esteem, so it's easy to see how we'd end up clashing in some areas.\n\nThanks!", "He's about 5 years older; we're both getting up there (46/51), and we're both pretty set in our ways.  Neither of us has ever been married or have kids and we both have some mental health issues.  The 2 times I called him grandpa were for driving slow and for going to bed at 9 regularly.\n\nI might need someone with thicker skin - my intention is never to be hurtful but sometimes my jokes miss the mark.  The breaks (3, I think) were all him not feeling loved enough.\n\nI go out without him a lot, since he doesn't like bars, and there doesn't seem to be a trust issue; I think he was genuinely trying to get out of his comfort zone for my sake and regretted it.", "Yeah but when someone is really drunk, not wanting to abandon them can also be a good thing. We just don't know how drunk she was. If she was drunk enough that she had trouble figuring out how to leave, she might have been too drunk to leave there alone. We don't know who was at the party. When somebody's drunk, their judgment is impaired. And when there are random people at parties, things can be unpredictable. They sound young and really immature. I think there's a decent possibility that if she was very drunk and he had ditched her there, people would be calling him an asshole.", "You guys are 46 and 51 years old respectively? Damn, your original post reads like you're in your early twenties. A 51 years old male behaving the way your boyfriend does sounds a bit... silly. Not the fact that he doesn't enjoy intoxication or goes to bed at 9, but deciding to go to a party last minute, then quietly leaving and waiting for you, getting annoyed at you for not following and then texting you a dry \"home\" sounds kind of manipulative to me.", "Way too old for drama, yet here I am, still hoping relationships get easier eventually..."]}
