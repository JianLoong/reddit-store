I'm 30f and due to being raised by a single dad who was a jack of all trades, I was taught a lot of shit that I guess \"normal girls\" wouldn't know. Not my words. Those are words of men mansplaining me 24/7. But anyways, I know how to do foundations and read blueprints, I know how to build houses (within reason), I know how to do plumbing, I know pretty much everything mechanically when it comes to vehicles. The only thing I can't and have no interest in doing is electrical work. I don't like it at all. Despite this, I don't use my trades for work. I have a real estate license that I use basically to find mls listings and nothing more but day by day I'm actually just an interior designer. \n\nI met my husband Jack 5 years ago and we got married last year. Now Jack isn't very hands on and doesn't really know how to do much of anything that I do but I've never paid any mind to that. He is a lawyer and was raised much differently than me. He enjoys me teaching him things and thinks I'm pretty fucking cool, so thats pretty great. But his father and his best friend are constantly doubting me and my abilities. \n\nLast year my husband and I decided to build. He said he wanted to see me in action. We could afford it so I thought \"why not?\" I borrowed most of my dad's equipment, set and poured the foundation myself, built all the walls up and put the roof on with the help of my husband and dad. Now we are working on the interior. Well FIL and my husband's best friend have stopped by a few times over the past 4 months and have made comments here and there, like \"you really trust this girl to build a house?\" They laugh afterwards, as if to suggest it's a joke but it's constant and frustrating. So they stopped by today as I was finishing up the plumbing for the downstairs bathroom. FIL says I'm doing it wrong and started talking about how the pipe needed to be straight, not slanted like I have it. Makes no fucking sense because you need a slanted pipe to prevent clogged pipes, but anyways, I know what I'm doing. But then him and my husband's buddy started laughing and yelled out \"Jack, she's fucking up your house.\" I immediately told them to leave. They put their hands up, \"we are just joking\". I said again to get out. Jack backed me and said \"the woman has spoken\". I'm getting messages from MIL saying I was wrong because it's her son's house too and FIL is just trying to be helpful to prevent his son from needing to pay for repairs.

In my early 20\u2019s I worked as a female engineer for Icicle Seafoods on their fishing boats and processors, when I was not doing that I was a subcontractor to shipyards repairing mostly military ships and facilities, and you would not believe how many men I reduced to tears after they would mansplain to the little woman. My boss even told me I had to quit making the deckhands and other guys cry and my response was always, when they quit saying or doing stupid shit I would stop. Met my husband on those ships and he loved everything about me and after our daughter was born he continued to work on ships and would often call so I could walk them through repairs and his coworkers would always question until the work was done \ud83d\ude02 Also my dad was a plumber you are absolutely correct and I know your house will be beautiful and love that your husband absolutely has your back.

Props to you for learning these skills and I hope your new home turns out great. Have fun with your project. \n\nFirst, if these guys did this same thing to tradesmen on site at a construction site with a builder, they would be escorted off and told they can no longer go there. You asking them to leave while they second-guessed everything you did is no different.\n\nSecond, their commentary and \"jokes\" were distracting, so a good response back to the MIL is that if everyone worried you would make mistakes (requiring future repairs), it was more likely to happen when people were distracting you and breaking your concentration.\n\nThird, props to Jack for having your back when you asked them to leave for their obviously sexist behavior.", "I'm an old lady with a renovator Dad who didn't care if I was a \"girl\".

That's some disrespect and powrplay that should not stand, if it's the home of you two, your in laws have no place in ever saying anything, only you and your husband have that right.

No matter how angry you get, how often you prove them wrong, or how frequently you call them out, men like his father and friend (unfortunately) aren\u2019t going to change their opinions or stop making these comments.

Not cool.", "NTA. Shit talking is a developed part of a relationship not just something you assume you can do.  So the \"just joking\" is bullshit.  I will say if it were my father and bf talking to my spouse that way, she wouldn't have to say anything to them.  Not because it's my duty as a man or anything stupid like that, but because they are people I'm bringing in.", "NTA. Your house, your rules, and one of those rules is not disrespecting your gender.", "NTA \n\nFIL had no intention of being helpful. Obviously, neither does MIL.
