When she was 18/19ish, she got a tramp stamp tattoo of a mascot of her favorite kpop group that use bunny rabbits that represent them. The one she has wears a red mask/bandanna since that\u2019s the one that represents her favorite member of the group.\n\nEver since the first time I\u2019ve seen this tattoo and she explained the meaning, I\u2019ve sort of had an issue with it for two reasons. One, the tattoo is in representation of another man, and to me, it feels like she has branded herself for that man, and two, I view kpop as a childish thing and expect tweens to be into it, like Justin Bieber or One Direction, but it makes her happy, so I usually keep my feelings about kpop to myself.\n\nEarlier this week, we were preparing to go out to eat and while she was changing I caught a glimpse of it. I asked her if she ever planned to get it removed and she said no. I then tell her how I feel about it, since we\u2019re very close to be husband and wife. I even suggested other tattoo ideas that could be based around us and offered to get it with her.\n\nLaura then called me stupid for thinking that way b/c everyone gets tattoos of singers and bands and it\u2019s a 1 in a million chance of her meeting that member and being with him. I then told her that her tattoo still screams \u201cI\u2019ve branded myself for a man\u201d and people get tattoos of real musicians, not fades and told her I expected it to be gone by the wedding day.\n\nLaura then called me an asshole and stormed out the room. She even refused to go to dinner with me. Since then, she doesn\u2019t talk or is short to me and has even resorted to sleeping in her office.\n\nI\u2019m one to admit when I\u2019m wrong, but in this situation, I don\u2019t think I am and that my reasons are understandable and think many other married men will see where I\u2019m coming from.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679169535, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11uyova/aita_for_asking_my_fianc\u00e9e_to_remove_her_kpop/", "score": 663, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know a lot of people who are into kpop and they are very invested in the fandom etc and it\u2019s just simply a big part of their life. She expressed that with a tattoo. That\u2019s all. It\u2019s not the Kpop star she wanted to stay with for the rest of her life or fell in love with. \n\nNow instead of her expressing her interest through a tattoo you offered her to brand herself with yourself?

She had it before you met so asking her to remove it as a condition for marriage is horribly controlling.  And your reasons behind it are incredibly misogynistic.  Also, calling it a tramp stamp?  Just ugh.  That term is misogynistic in the first place.  Lower back tattoo is a perfectly acceptable description of the placement.  Hopefully she realizes you are a controlling, sexist AH and drops you because I can guarantee it will probably get worse if you actually get married.", "YTA and she needs to leave your ass", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re being grossly controlling over how she presents her own body in the world.", "YTA.

How likely is it that they are to run off into the sunset to live happily ever after. \n\nIf the tattoo was One Direction, backstreet boys, or muse, would you then feel she has branded herself for ALL the men in those bands?!

First of all, tattoo removal is a long and expensive process. I\u2019m not sure when the wedding is, but there\u2019s a high likelihood that it wouldn\u2019t be gone by then even if Laura was willing to get it removed. And, once again, if she were willing to get it removed, would you be willing to pay for the removal? You better be with all these demands you\u2019re making.\n\nBut, let\u2019s be real, Laura is not interested in getting her tattoo removed. And why should she? It\u2019s meaningful and important to her, which is all that matters BTW. Protecting your fragile ego is not a good reason to get a tattoo removed.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s amusing to me that you\u2019re calling artists whose fan bases are primarily young women \u201cchildish.\u201d Get your misogyny in check.

When she was 18/19ish, she got a tramp stamp tattoo of a mascot of her favorite kpop group that use bunny rabbits that represent them. The one she has wears a red mask/bandanna since that\u2019s the one that represents her favorite member of the group.\n\nEver since the first time I\u2019ve seen this tattoo and she explained the meaning, I\u2019ve sort of had an issue with it for two reasons. One, the tattoo is in representation of another man, and to me, it feels like she has branded herself for that man, and two, I view kpop as a childish thing and expect tweens to be into it, like Justin Bieber or One Direction, but it makes her happy, so I usually keep my feelings about kpop to myself.\n\nEarlier this week, we were preparing to go out to eat and while she was changing I caught a glimpse of it. I asked her if she ever planned to get it removed and she said no. I then tell her how I feel about it, since we\u2019re very close to be husband and wife. I even suggested other tattoo ideas that could be based around us and offered to get it with her.\n\nLaura then called me stupid for thinking that way b/c everyone gets tattoos of singers and bands and it\u2019s a 1 in a million chance of her meeting that member and being with him. I then told her that her tattoo still screams \u201cI\u2019ve branded myself for a man\u201d and people get tattoos of real musicians, not fades and told her I expected it to be gone by the wedding day.\n\nLaura then called me an asshole and stormed out the room. She even refused to go to dinner with me. Since then, she doesn\u2019t talk or is short to me and has even resorted to sleeping in her office.\n\nI\u2019m one to admit when I\u2019m wrong, but in this situation, I don\u2019t think I am and that my reasons are understandable and think many other married men will see where I\u2019m coming from.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So the problem with the tattoo isn\u2019t the tattoo itself, it\u2019s that the tattoo is a reminder that you\u2019re not her number one choice (and everyone deserves to be with a spouse who feels\u2014and treats them like\u2014their number one choice).\n\nRemember, you don\u2019t get to control other people\u2019s tattoo choices. You DO get to control your own choices, and if you decide someone isn\u2019t for you, you don\u2019t have to justify that choice to anyone.\n\nSo, you DON\u2019T get to decide her tattoo choices or whether or not she\u2019d take the chance to be with her famous crush is she ever got the opportunity. You DO get to decide for yourself whether a potential spouse having a tattoo of another man is a deal breaker for you (regardless of whether it is for anyone else) and you don\u2019t have to justify your dealbreakers to anyone.\n\nETA: downvote me all you want folks. Everyone has their dealbreakers, and everyone is allowed to have their own dealbreakers. None of us have to agree with each others deal breakers, but (if we want to be decent people with healthy relationships) we do have to respect one another\u2019s right to have their own dealbreakers. \n\nExpecting that someone to has to justify or change their dealbreakers for you is classic narcissism. \n\nThe commenters on AITA are great on some topics, but on other topics you can really see the inverse relationship between the amount of time people spend on social media and the amount of tools they have to cultivate healthy relationships in real life.", "NTA because you communicated your true feelings about a subject.
