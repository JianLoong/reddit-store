We never had this issue before (at least, to my knowledge) and it's just disconcerting to experience all the same. Another friend stated it could be because I did better than her in school and now that she's in a better paying job she feels like she's higher on a social hierarchy? The bizarre thing to me is why she feels the need to do that when I've never been one to gloat about my grades (if anything I was very harsh with myself and had terrible esteem issues because I was never good enough in my parents eyes). Her performance was never remotely in my purview.\n\n>Outing you and giving you trash as a gift are two really big signs\n\nFor the outing me bit... she claimed her sister strong armed her into it, which frankly, I can see her doing. But not notifying me immediately and not even trying to apologize did bother me quite a bit. I had also never dated so to nosy people, it will set off flags.\n\nBut the trashy gift thing is new to this year. I'm stunned this happened, especially since she was the one who apparently extended the olive branch.", "The easy answer to the source of the competition is that it's a reaction to her traumatic past. One way to feel good about yourself is to feel better than someone else, and that's accomplished by knocking that person down. It works on a personal level and explains a LOT of bigotry the world over. Also there's the possibility that she's inherited some of the abusive and toxic behaviors she was exposed to. Not that this would be conscious or targeted- she could be reacting off of what she thinks is normal and this is all deeply ingrained.\n\nThis stuff is good to know but it's not important: what you DO is important, and it seems smart to cut this person off and move on.", "Don'T overthink it - this is HER drama, not yours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust get sonme distance without making it obvious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnswer her text and cxalls slower (Fine to wait a few days), and sadly the dates she proposes for meeting you won't work because you already have other important plans.", "You're making a mistake many good people do which is to try to understand the reasons for something rather than simply realize that if you're being treated badly the reasons are, at best, secondary, and your priority should be to protect yourself.\n\nBad things keep happening to you bc of this person, but you keep trying to understand, understand, understand them instead of just stopping your association with them so bad things stop happening to you.", "I definitely have been way too permissive. I had to cut this part out because of the word limit in the original post but she used to dump her trauma on me and it can be quite distressing for me because she's extremely unregulated. I can't help but feel sorry for her because I've been there and it took me nearly a decade of therapy to find my footing. It took me a long while to convince her to go therapy and it was after the outing incident she mentioned she claimed she has started going to therapy. It was why I decided to give her a chance again...but my patience is worn thin now. Since going to therapy she's just become insufferable in that she can't help but make her trauma her entire personality.\n\nI do feel guilt everytime I try to put distance but I think I need to accept this so called friendship has run its course."]}
