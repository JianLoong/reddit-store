Normally I would encourage family to help a nursing student practice, but practicing on family is intended for basic assessments and not for invasive procedures. Catheter inserts pose risk of infection even when done using perfectly sterile technique, which if she is learning she may not have perfected. I am a nurse, and I can tell you that she will eventually get lots of practice during her clinical placements, and in her first year on the job depending where it is. \n\nAnyway, the hard part as a student isn\u2019t really the tube going in, it\u2019s preparing the supplies and patient and staying sterile. If you want to compromise and are comfortable, she could practice the set up and then talk through the tube insert, balloon inflation, etc. without actually putting it in you. If she\u2019s still not confident for her clinical skills testing, there should be a lab at school with a mannequin she can use.", " I let my wife practice drawing blood.  I was the first real person she put a needle into. I would draw the line at a catheter", "NTA. You are her spouse, not her practice dummy. While some things would probably be fine, something like a catheter insertion is quite invasive and I imagine a lot of people would not be comfortable with that. Heck, if my partner asked to practice that on me, it would be a hard no.", "Lmao bullshit", "NTA. Ask her if she still wants you to make sweet sweet love to her with the member she\u2019s about to cram a tube into.", "NTA. I\u2019ve got a high pain tolerance and I don\u2019t really give a shit, so I\u2019d do it, but I know dudes are usually pretty protective of their twig and berries.", "NTA. Someone very close to me had to have this done, and it is no joy-ride. Not something you do just for the heck of it. Nurses learn by assisting necessary insertions of catheders. She too will learn, hopefully. Not all doctors and nurses are equally talented with this procedure, I am told.", "I\u2019m curious as to what nursing school requires nursing students to \u201cpractice\u201d catheterization at home?  Mine certainly did not.", "NTA. No way. Anybody saying it doesn't hurt is either lying or (more likely) got it while they were on heavy pain meds in the hospital. \n\nAlso, WTF? Even if it didn't hurt, why is she even suggesting that she practice an invasive medical procedure on her husband? Not cool.\n\nI thought you were going to say she was studying to be a massage therapist. That's the kind of thing you practice on a loved one. Maybe an occasional small tattoo. Not shoving things into your tiniest orifices.", "NTA for saying no, your body, your choice. \nIt probably wouldn't actually be painful... I've had a catheter a few times and don't remember it ever hurting, but I still wouldn't want to be practiced on. \n\nYou wanna check my BP? I'm down. Just not interested in family/friends practicing on such an intimate area. \n\nBUT, you said you freaked out a bit... if you were rude or anything like that, you may have reacted in a way that was hurtful.", "Is this like research for a comedic set up?

I know some people say their spouses are a pain in the you-know-what, but they usually do not mean it literally.  \n\nI think that if your spouse is in nursing school or medical school, it is fair for her to ask you to be a practice patient for certain things -- mainly things that involving talking, or using instruments like  a stethoscope.  But actually inserting something into your body is a very reasonable boundary to draw.", "NTA\n \nIs it even ethical for her to practice on you until she is licensed? No. She needs to consult the school to get practice.", "Nah she can take her catheter and stick it.", "Tell her you will do it only if she records herself asking if this is normal to do in front of the whole class and everyone will probably laugh at her", "Pretty sure if this was real your wife should be kicked out of nursing school.", "This can not be real.  No nursing school is going to send a student home with  catheters to \"practice\" on people.  The nursing schools I'm familiar with, they don't even practice on other students.

I'm not a guy, so my urethra is much shorter, and I've had catheters in the past that were painless, but this would still be a hard NO from me. If she is so good at it that it is painless, she doesn't need to practice, if she needs the practice, there is a real chance of pain. You are also usually not supposed to do this to a person multiple times. The catheter stays in for a while until it needs replacement, it's not a repeated in and out procedure. Even when done correctly, it's still an intrusion into the body and there will likely be swelling, soreness, and general discomfort. \n\nNo matter how much you love her and want to be supportive, don't do this.", "NTA.

She will be given plenty of opportunities to practice on patients who actually need this. Given the irritation and potential harm that it cause if done improperly, she is irresponsible for even asking you.", "NTA. Good grief I can't imagine any worthwhile nursing school that would even encourage DIY catheterization. I am also going to imagine it might possibly be illegal.", "Ask her what she think of you..her guinea pig??", "NTA.  When they talk about \"the practice of medicine\" that's not what they have in mind.

If its catheter insertion on penis or vagina they're are done in clinical setting supervised. Some wont even allow cath insertion for men without proper training because men can bleed due to trauma.

He's drawn my blood before when he worked as a phlebotomist, and I'd let him start an IV on me, but no way would I let him cath me!", "NTA: I am a long time nurse and it is not appropriate for her to practice invasive skills on you. It opens you up to potential trauma to the urethra and infection. She will get clinical experience in real life, supervised by another nurse for these kinds of skills.

They feel really weird. But not painful. However you shouldn't do something so invasive in a non sterile environment, and it's your body you get to decide. It's not the kind of thing you should do without a good reason like medical testing or other procedures that require it anyways.
