It\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. Kids can kick off some days and it\u2019s tough but if they do it in public and are screaming things like help me and the person with them doesn\u2019t look like a parent then it\u2019s better to check.

One day she threw a massive tantrum when it was time to leave (dad was a theatre director, she wanted to stay and play on the stage) and her dad asked me to come help him put her in the car.

It was hopefully nothing and the little lady was just having a tantrum but grandma wasn\u2019t handling it too well and the girl was shouting for help in a public space.
