{"id": 31342, "submission_id": "17ziy9z", "title": "AITA for wanting my husband to make his own meals while I recover from c-section?", "selftext": "I (23F) am 6 weeks postpartum and had a c-section, surgery complications, currently have a post-surgery infection and suffer from chronic back pain that recently made me legally disabled. My husband (26M) has had to quit his job to help me at home with the kids. Before I was pregnant and during my pregnancy I made his breakfast and lunch everyday for work as well as dinner when he got home. Since the pregnancy and surgery complications my mum (who lives upstairs) has been making all of our dinners. \n\nHere\u2019s the issue - I recently noticed my husband wasn\u2019t eating breakfast or lunch unless we got takeaways (which we can\u2019t really afford). I started reminding him to have breakfast and lunch and he kept saying there\u2019s no food in the house (not true). It started to get frustrating so I started going into the kitchen when he said there was no food and making him full meals that I knew he would love and also be able to make for himself. It\u2019s not easy for me to cook for that long because of the pain but I really wanted to show him that there\u2019s food he can make so he would start eating. Well, it didn\u2019t work. He would just thank me for the food, eat it, not eat until my mum made dinner again and then stop eating again the very next day. He has now started going to the bakery every morning for pies, pizza bread, chicken etc and then doesn\u2019t eat until my mum makes him dinner that evening. We can\u2019t afford to keep buying bakery food everyday.\n\nI think it\u2019s important to note that we look after the kids together and despite my health issues I am able to contribute enough that he is not without time to make himself food.\n\nHe says I shouldn\u2019t be bothered by it because he\u2019s not complaining that he\u2019s hungry, he\u2019s not asking me to cook for him and he really doesn\u2019t mind not eating all day. He says he barely ate growing up due to his family having very little money, so he is used to it. But we have 3 kids, we barely sleep and he is so exhausted that he falls asleep sitting, several times throughout the day. I\u2019ve told him he needs food for energy and for his health. It stresses me out that he won\u2019t eat because he refuses to cook for himself, even just toast. I nag him about this everyday and he wants me to stop. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\n(He knows I am posting this and is going to read the comments)", "created_utc": 1700464786, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ziy9z/aita_for_wanting_my_husband_to_make_his_own_meals/", "score": 471, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What isn't okay is for him to be falling asleep and not helping. He needs to figure out why its happening and fix that issue himself!", "NTA, not only is it not healthy for him to not eat but it\u2019s not a healthy relationship he\u2019s modelling for the kids.

Binge eating at dinner instead of spacing meals throughout the day to properly sustain energy. \nMy husband is not a chef by any means either and would frequently forget to eat before we had our son. He has taken a ton more accountability in this now and cooks breakfast and lunch for both of us on weekends as he\u2019s now back to work during the week.

Boilling pasta its very easy and there are other recipies on the internet he could do very easily. He just dont want to. Idk what ages are your other kids, but at this point I dont know what reason he has to stay at home from work. \n\nNTA. Both of you are adults.

Your wife just endured one of the most physically traumatic surgeries a person can survive, on top of being previously disabled. Figure out how to feed yourself regularly and do it, if for no other reason than to not give her something else to worry about it. \n\nNotwithstanding any of that, cooking is a skill not a talent, and one that every adult should be at least passably proficient in. Now's as good a time as any. Get to it. You're a parent now, and your child will need to eat regularly. Pawning the entirety of that task onto your wife is not an option, especially when you're (at least ostensibly) her full time caregiver.", "NTA and if he truly didn\u2019t mind not eating he wouldn\u2019t spent too much money at the bakery. He\u2019s making a HE problem a YOU problem", "NTA and he sounds like he is manipulating you into either cooking for him or feeling guilty that you don\u2019t. He may be doing it unintentionally but spending money you can\u2019t afford and bringing up childhood poverty as an excuse for not eating is weird. You don\u2019t need that stress right now.", "NTA.  To me this sounds like a man who is using either his laziness or weaponized incompetence to force his (literally disabled) wife to cook for him or to watch him overspend their budget. \n\nWhat a dick.", "NTA.  But your husband doesn\u2019t cook for himself, surely you guys can come up with inexpensive ways for him to feed himself.

You don't \"have to\" make breakfast and lunch for him. He's an adult. If he'd rather not eat than make a piece of toast, fine.\n\nIf you're really determined that he eat, so much so that you'll make it for him, that's your choice. But in that case, why not just make him some toast or a quick sandwich at lunchtime instead of hurting yourself making elaborate meals? He doesn't need a full meal at lunchtime if your mum's making one for dinner.", "NTA. Your husband is manipulative. He's complaining because he knows you'll cook. Focus on your baby and recover", "NTA, he should cook for you instead or buy takeaways .", "NTA. You husband is starving himself because he can\u2019t cook? Laughable. YouTube vids and tell him to make food for you from your available groceries.", "NTA, Jesus Christ", "NTA. His 'there's  no food' bleating really means 'there's no food available that doesn't involve me making it'.  He is exhausted because he's hungry and not rating properly.

If he needs help as to what to make he can ask.", "Your husband has given up work to look after you because you have just given birth and are disabled. He should be doing that - looking after you.

It's not how I would have wanted to live my life but ultimately he's an adult and can fend for himself.\n\nYou worry about you for now.", "NTA\n So he would rather starve than have to make his own food.  He is basically saying I would rather die than cook. The long-term side effects can even lead to a heart attack, among other things.  That is not something he should be placed on you even when you are not recovering from surgery. Being a responsible parent also means taking care of yourself so you are able to care for your children.\nPlease tell me he doesn't drive. If he does, I wouldn't let the kids in the car with him until he fixes himself.", "NTA.  If he just wasn\u2019t eating, I\u2019d say leave him be and let him be hungry but going out and spending money you don\u2019t have because he won\u2019t fix food for himself makes him a huge AH.\n\nFWIW, I had three c-sections with no complications and my husband took over meal prep for the weeks after I got home.

He can do that himself.", "Sorry, generic you (as in you guys), not meant for OP to do by herself.  It sounds like his learned helplessness may prevent him from doing it by himself, or he would have before going hungry.", "I meant that as a generic you (and have accordingly edited it to \u201cyou guys\u201d).\n\nIt\u2019s a pathetic kind of helplessness to not be able to assemble a simple meal for himself, but you\u2019re right, he may have that bad a degree of learned helplessness.  Helping him plan his food may help bridge him into having more ability to take care of himself.", "Obviously he can\u2019t.  Sometimes people who have learned helplessness need to be guided into better self-sufficiency, because left on their own they just keep falling on their faces.", "Oh I\u2019m sorry for being too literal Lolol.  I thought you meant her. \ud83d\ude02", "That\u2019s the thing, I think he\u2019s able to. Just chooses not to. It\u2019s not like a PB and J or a cooked egg and toast is hard to make.

I edited to make it clearer", "But it takes the planning to have the things in the house to do that - when you were a kid, your parents did that.  Helping husband become more self-sufficient makes a lot more sense than just watching him fail over and over.\n\nMy husband often forgets to eat (or eats badly) if he doesn\u2019t meal plan.  If I remind him to meal plan and add it to the weekly shopping list (he shops, not me), it cuts his forgetting or getting takeout/prepared food for lunch by a lot - in a good week, he doesn\u2019t do either at all, overall I think it gets him to average about 80% feeding himself better.  He needs to be nudged to do his meal planning the same day we do our dinner meal planning, because he won\u2019t remember on his own.  I do occasionally wonder how he survived before me, but the truth is that he did it exactly as you\u2019d think: often missing meals or eating crap and procrastinating taking care of himself or his home until he was forced to.  At this point, I\u2019m pretty severely physically disabled and he finally got diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago, so we\u2019ve settled into an understanding that I generally make the to-do list and keep adding things as needed, and he does what\u2019s on the list.", "Sometimes being a good partner means helping your partner learn to help themself.

It\u2019s in that bottom cupboard.\u201d When he bends over to look for the pan, I do the same thing and put my face right there and point. \u201cThat\u2019s the pan. Turn the burner on. It\u2019s that nozzle. It has that picture right next to it. Watch. The stove top turns red right there. You put the pan there..\u201d etc. etc. and I stand real close to him. \nIt was a lot of work and a lot of words. Needless to say, he never asked, \u201ccan you make me a full American breakfast again?\u201d", "NTA.  Your husband wants to eat, he just doesn't want to prepare it.  Take away his means to get takeout and I bet you his hungry A$$ will find something in the house to eat.  Also, quit having your mom take care of him.  If you mom wants to help, it should only be for you and the kids.  He is a grown man!", "NTA. Are you sure you don\u2019t have 4 children and are actually a single mum? Cause it sounds to me like your husband is your fourth child \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Gentle ETA. You\u2019re right that making simple meals for himself is easy. But it sounds like y\u2019all have 3 kids and his falling asleep during the day probably has more to do with extreme sleep deprivation than food. As long as you and the kids are eating three meals a day, as an adult he\u2019s allowed to decide to cut corners to have more time to rest.\n\nAlso I empathize with him spending too much money on pre made foods and he is TA if it\u2019s completely blowing the budget. But a recurring theme I see with new parents who don\u2019t have enough outside help is that the mom wants to sacrifice her own well being to hit arbitrary standards (getting up while recovering from c section to show hubby how to cook) whereas men will cut corners in life to create more breathing room (eating out more instead of cooking.) \n\nUnless y\u2019all are falling behind on rent or something, or he\u2019s neglecting to cook for the children, you should let this one go. You\u2019ll be healed from c section soon enough so this is a temporary problem.", "NTA He's a parent. He can't let his health suffer on account of his laziness.", "No, NTA, but you set yourself up for this by catering to him.\n\nWhere is it written that the woman in the relationship makes all meals? Stop this today. If you value your sanity, never go back to this pattern. Start right away sharing the duties.\n\nThis may have to include teaching your husband how to cook. Do not put this off! You\u2019re only 23. Imagine yourself 30 years from now still making food for this dude three times a day. At your age, it entirely possible you could be married 70+ years.\n\nBegin as you mean to go on.", "Congrats on your 4th child", "Speak to him about the costs of him ordering out and come to an agreement about how much discretionary money each person has. Then as long as he doesn't go over his allotted discretionary fund just leave him be. If he spends all his allotted fun money on food, so be it. If he doesn't eat, so be it. Don't cook for him but don't nag him into eating either just let him manage his own stomach.", "INFO: why did you have a child with a child?", "NTA. Bigger issue is your husband is lazy and used your situation as an excuse to quit his job. I understand short term you needed more help but he is obviously not capable of helping enough to justify not working. \n\nThis will likely screw your family over financially for a long time. Get him back into a job asap. A better option would be family or friends helping, short term nanny, short term day care or literally anything else. \n\nAnd yes you will also need to have a conversation around laziness. I mean he can\u2019t even pour some cereal for his own breakfast?", "NTA\n\nOh my god, c-section, 3+1 kids and complications! You have enough to worry about, I just join the massive comment flood saying the weaponized incompetence thingy of which I have never heard before but I wish I did.\n\nGet healthy! Take care!", "You are NTA but your husband sure is. You're recovering from surgery with complications and not only is he complaining about there not being food in the house but he's making you feel like you have to make food for him so he eats. If he at 26 does not know how to pour a bowl of cereal, toast a bagel, or make a sandwich, he needs to start watching YouTube videos and get his shit together. Not o ly should you _not_ be cooking for him, especially when it makes you feel worse, he should be cooking for _you_. Why isnt he bringing you breakfast? Leaving you a plate in the fridge for lunch? You had major abdominal surgery and are suffering an infection and he can't be bothered to take care of you or himself? \n\nIf your husband is reading this- learn how to cook. It's a very important skill to have, it will save you loads of money in the future, and there are thousands of not millions of food blogs, you tube videos, and cook books that will teach you basic skills you can build from. It took me months to recover from my C-section and I did not have any complications post surgery. You are an adult and a parent now, get your shit together. And no, bringing home a paycheck is not enough.", "Your concern about him not eating is spot on and I hope he listens to you. You\u2019re smart to be thinking about your budget and the cost of takeout too. Having a new baby is exhausting on both of you. Can you / he / mom batch cook and freeze a few meals?", "NTA for not wanting to make him food. But, and this is a huge but you have 3 children and neither one of you work? So you are feeding 5 people with no income. Both of you need to get it together. This is an awful environment to raise 3 children in. Children should not be brought up in a environment like this. A great example of this would be your husband. Please get it together for your children.", "NTA. You gotta be kidding me.", "NTA\u2026.but Neither is your hubby an A. If he\u2019s not asking you to cook, isn\u2019t complaining about the frequency of his meals, or lack thereof, and has quit work to take care of the situation at home, it\u2019s hard to call him out. As long he\u2019s being attentive to your needs, and understanding of your pain and discomfort, then let him be regarding his eating.\n\nIf there truly is a money issue and the frequency of his taking out is overwhelming your budget, then he may deserve some ribbing, but it sounds like it\u2019s not every other meal, or you wouldn\u2019t be worried about him getting run down.", "NTAH. I read this aloud to my husband, and he said \"WTF?! Tell him to eat the food that's at home and can make himself\"...my opinion is that if he doesn't want to make stuff, then he should be eating simple things like cereal or making toast from stuff bought at the store. In absolutely no way should you have to cook for him. My uterus hurt just from reading your post. I hope you rest up and heal quickly.", "Congratulations. You don't have  3 kids, you have 4 kids. And the biggest one of them all is   passive aggressive. \"Oh, I don't need to eat\",  \"Oh, I'm used to not eating because we were so  poor\", \"Oh, I'm not fainting from hunger,  I'm just falling asleep\", \"Oh, I'm sure I'll be alright until Mommy makes me dinner\".\n\nStop nagging. If he's hungry enough, he'll learn to cook. As for the going out to eat, who controls the cash flow? Can you cut him off the way you would with any irresponsible child?\n\nNTA. He is. So is Mommy.", "The way people don't realize c sections are invasive surgeries! Chainsaws were originally made to be gynecological tools!", "Precisely \ud83d\ude05 It honestly *DOES NOT MATTER* if he doesn\u2019t like preparing food or cleaning up, that is part of existing as a human being, and also having kids. Who TF is feeding the kids??!?! This problem will only get worse. Not eating and pretending like you\u2019re some suffering deity who is being SO GOOD for not complaining while he waits for someone to feed him is not a solution.", "The 'bread-stuff-bread'is sending me", "As an American, I've read many posts that indicate spaghetti bolognaise is a fundamental British food like sausage rolls or (Heinz) beans on toast.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 perfect response.", "Perfect respond\n\nOP NTA\n\nYour incompetent husband is an AH!", "This sounds nothing like that though. He's not trying to get OP to make food for him by insisting he can't, he's trying to get OP to stop nagging him to eat meals he doesn't want to eat.", "I'd agree if he was pushing for her to do it for him because he can't for whatever reason, but he's not by OPs own admission in this post. He just doesn't want to cook. \n\nI'd say that OP should ask husband IF he can afford it instead of saying he can't. It sounds like he is the one who is bringing home the money, so he might have some extra money for his food needs.(( Edit to add: missed the part in the post where she said he quit his job. Husband is YTA))\n\nI'm dealing with this right now as well. My husband thinks that because he makes less money than me and he can not afford to eat out that I also can't afford to and I need to save my money. I told him I'm saving lots, I make lots, and I made it so I'd like to use some of it to spend on things I like. And to treat him as well.", "I don't know if it's that because he isn't making her do it. I don't think he's intentionally weaponising it, he's just being regular lazy.\n\nHe may have ADHD or something.", "It's sad that you even had to do all of that. I don't understand how so many men reach adulthood with such incompetence.", "It's an American staple too, we just call it \"spaghetti with red sauce\"", "I'm someone who Can't Cook^(TM) and I still manage to eat lunch.\n\nWhen I've been really strapped for time and/or money:\n\nOatmeal for breakfast - makes in the microwave in 2 mins\n\nRamen, mac & cheese, canned ravioli or similar locally available easy-prep meal for lunch. \n\nIt could be weaponized incompetence, but I wonder if the husband is actually (or also) having a mental health crisis. Not eating can be a depression symptom. Husband is presumably wiped out given that (a) his wife went thru major medical complications, (b) he lost his job and (c) he is helping care for a newborn. Given the mention that he won't even make toast, it seems possible that he is having a problem with eating, not (or not only) a problem with cooking. I have witnessed situations where depressed people didn't want to eat unless someone cooked for them in which case they felt obligated.\n\nI kind of hope that's the case because the alternative is that he's so insecure in his gender that he'd rather starve himself than depress a toaster button. \n\n**@ Husband:** You need to start making yourself something to eat at breakfast and lunch time whether you want to cook and eat or not. If you do not, you cause your wife to worry (rightfully) about your health and make her feel obligated to cook something for you. You are T A for this because your recovering wife should NOT be worrying about whether you, a grown adult, are eating food.", "I\u2019m curious as to who is feeding the kids.", "Instead he gets takeaway or goes to the bakery for something to eat. He's an adult, so he's free to skip meals when he wants (as long as he doesn't complain afterwards that no one (no woman) made him a meal) if it doesn't affect his ability to care for his family.\n\nHe's definitely no winner in my book.", "I have ADHD. It's not an excuse here. He doesn't have to make a five-course meal. Throw together some pasta, a sandwich, or something.", "He\u2019s pretending he can\u2019t do it to see if he guilts her into doing it", "It's more involved", "It looks like they have a very specific thick meat sauce with diced celery, carrots, onions, bacon and ground beef.", "Fair, but it's still not weaponised incompetence. Weaponised incompetence is when he does try it and does it so badly she never wants to ask him to do it again.\n\nHe's just being regular lazy.\n\nI also suspect that he doesn't see how it is inconveniencing her because he isn't actually wanting her to pick up his slack and she's still eating. He probably sees the only person affected is himself, and he's making the choice for himself to go hungry or not. Of course it means he has less energy for other stuff, but he probably isn't making that connection.\n\nHe's being lazy, and should be less lazy, but weaponised incompetence is specific and intentional, and I don't think this is.", "We used ours so much when I was newly postpartum. Our neighbor has a key for emergencies and let us know they were going to leave something for us. We got home from the hospital to a fresh loaf of home made bread, bowls laid out, and a meal simmering away in the slow cooker. The cats had even been spoiled with tuna for the night", "I do. A number of people lie about who they are until they get married or they become complacent and refuse to put on their big-boy pants when s*** hits the fan. It can lead to a lack of trust and a sense of low self-worth when your own spouse won't take steps to support you physically or emotionally.\n\nI will say it's kinda odd he quit his job to \"help\" and then... where's the help?\n\nP.s.

I take it to the extreme, you know? I waited for 2+ years out of almost 10 years to wait for change and be patient. It took a toll on my physical and mental health. I finally realized the relationship and marriage was never that great (we had many good times, but it's a long story) and the only realistic option I had was to leave if I wanted a better life.\n\n I understand what you're saying though, you'd think and hope the OP would have been able to realize these issues sooner, but what can I say? Love can be blind af.\n\nThen there's that \"well, I put X amount of years into this relationship/marriage so... should I just toss it all away?\" And this logic isn't... good logic...", "I get that too and know the amount of courage to get out of that type of relationship. My problem with OP though and why I have zero sympathy for her is because she CHOSE to bring more kids into this situation. Like it\u2019s not a stretch to conclude that he probably never made food for himself and instead relied on her or her mom. What did she do in this situation? make him a father of two more poor kids! That is so irresponsible and selfish."]}
