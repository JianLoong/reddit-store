{"id": 31342, "submission_id": "17ziy9z", "title": "AITA for wanting my husband to make his own meals while I recover from c-section?", "selftext": "I (23F) am 6 weeks postpartum and had a c-section, surgery complications, currently have a post-surgery infection and suffer from chronic back pain that recently made me legally disabled. My husband (26M) has had to quit his job to help me at home with the kids. Before I was pregnant and during my pregnancy I made his breakfast and lunch everyday for work as well as dinner when he got home. Since the pregnancy and surgery complications my mum (who lives upstairs) has been making all of our dinners. \n\nHere\u2019s the issue - I recently noticed my husband wasn\u2019t eating breakfast or lunch unless we got takeaways (which we can\u2019t really afford). I started reminding him to have breakfast and lunch and he kept saying there\u2019s no food in the house (not true). It started to get frustrating so I started going into the kitchen when he said there was no food and making him full meals that I knew he would love and also be able to make for himself. It\u2019s not easy for me to cook for that long because of the pain but I really wanted to show him that there\u2019s food he can make so he would start eating. Well, it didn\u2019t work. He would just thank me for the food, eat it, not eat until my mum made dinner again and then stop eating again the very next day. He has now started going to the bakery every morning for pies, pizza bread, chicken etc and then doesn\u2019t eat until my mum makes him dinner that evening. We can\u2019t afford to keep buying bakery food everyday.\n\nI think it\u2019s important to note that we look after the kids together and despite my health issues I am able to contribute enough that he is not without time to make himself food.\n\nHe says I shouldn\u2019t be bothered by it because he\u2019s not complaining that he\u2019s hungry, he\u2019s not asking me to cook for him and he really doesn\u2019t mind not eating all day. He says he barely ate growing up due to his family having very little money, so he is used to it. But we have 3 kids, we barely sleep and he is so exhausted that he falls asleep sitting, several times throughout the day. I\u2019ve told him he needs food for energy and for his health. It stresses me out that he won\u2019t eat because he refuses to cook for himself, even just toast. I nag him about this everyday and he wants me to stop. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\n(He knows I am posting this and is going to read the comments)", "created_utc": 1700464786, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ziy9z/aita_for_wanting_my_husband_to_make_his_own_meals/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA.\n\nHe\u2019s fully capable of taking care of himself, so if he doesn\u2019t want to eat, let him be. If you can\u2019t readily afford to buy takeout, put your foot down on that. Bless your mother for her willingness and help in regard to cooking dinner.", "NTA, you\u2019ve just been cut open, he should be making you meals and helping your recovery along. If he doesn\u2019t know how to make meals there\u2019s plenty of online video tutorials and cooking shows he can consult and having kids is about being willing to go out of your comfort zone.", "Info : Who made breakfast/lunch for you and the kids ?", "NTA. Look up weaponized incompetence, because that's what this sounds like to me.", "NTA. Husband is. If he doesn't want to eat that's fine. I wouldn't bug him about it, if my DH was stupid enough to starve cause he refused to feed himself I wouldn't worry I'd be laughing behind his back at what a baby he was being. What isn't okay is for him to be falling asleep and not helping. He needs to figure out why its happening and fix that issue himself!", "NTA, not only is it not healthy for him to not eat but it\u2019s not a healthy relationship he\u2019s modelling for the kids. It might teach them that if someone doesn\u2019t do something for you, don\u2019t do it until they break down and do it anyways. \nIt\u2019s also not a healthy relationship with food that he\u2019s modelling. Binge eating at dinner instead of spacing meals throughout the day to properly sustain energy. \nMy husband is not a chef by any means either and would frequently forget to eat before we had our son. He has taken a ton more accountability in this now and cooks breakfast and lunch for both of us on weekends as he\u2019s now back to work during the week. He makes his own lunches for work which is something I had begged him to do for 5 years prior. I hope your husband will start doing the same after reading these comments with you.", "This is weaponized incompetence, he\u2019s not cooking the food available and spending money you can\u2019t afford on convenience food. \n\nTally up the amount of money going to his unnecessary spending and show him. Create meal plans together with dishes that you both can manage cooking. NTA", "Why did he quit his job - i guess your only source of income at the moment - if he cant even cook? Cook for you, for your kids and for himself?! What he does all day? Watch the kids? Thats it? What the kids eat all day? What do you eat?\n\nHe just dont want to learn how to cook. Its not that hard. Boilling pasta its very easy and there are other recipies on the internet he could do very easily. He just dont want to. Idk what ages are your other kids, but at this point I dont know what reason he has to stay at home from work. \n\nNTA. Both of you are adults. You are not his mother to be worried about if this adult has eaten all day! \n\n>He says he barely ate growing up due to his family having very little money, so he is used to it. But we have 3 kids, we barely sleep and he is so exhausted that he falls asleep sitting, several times throughout the day.\n\nThis family not having money is soooooo guilt trip. And makes no scense to bring it up. Because, at the moment, you guys have enought food and money. He just choose not to eat. \n\nIm sorry, he is acting like a child. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. How lazy do you have to be to not even feed yourself. \n\nHe is setting a bad example for your kids and is going to run himself down and get sick.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is though.\n\nNot sure if it is just laziness on his part or whether he just enjoys wasting what little money you have now he is not working", "And this is who you picked to have three kids with at 23? Nice choice \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "OP: NTA. Once again we have one spouse setting the bar several feet underground and the other still managing to find a way to trip over it. \n\nAt the husband in question: dude, pull your head in. Seriously. Your wife just endured one of the most physically traumatic surgeries a person can survive, on top of being previously disabled. Figure out how to feed yourself regularly and do it, if for no other reason than to not give her something else to worry about it. \n\nNotwithstanding any of that, cooking is a skill not a talent, and one that every adult should be at least passably proficient in. Now's as good a time as any. Get to it. You're a parent now, and your child will need to eat regularly. Pawning the entirety of that task onto your wife is not an option, especially when you're (at least ostensibly) her full time caregiver.", "NTA and if he truly didn\u2019t mind not eating he wouldn\u2019t spent too much money at the bakery. He\u2019s making a HE problem a YOU problem", "NTA and he sounds like he is manipulating you into either cooking for him or feeling guilty that you don\u2019t. He may be doing it unintentionally but spending money you can\u2019t afford and bringing up childhood poverty as an excuse for not eating is weird. You don\u2019t need that stress right now.", "NTA.  To me this sounds like a man who is using either his laziness or weaponized incompetence to force his (literally disabled) wife to cook for him or to watch him overspend their budget. \n\nWhat a dick.", "NTA.  But your husband doesn\u2019t cook for himself, surely you guys can come up with inexpensive ways for him to feed himself.  Sandwich fixings, salad fixings, making extra at dinner so there are leftovers, frozen stuff or prepared-ahead options that just needs to be nuked or tossed in the oven\u2026there are lots of options for him to eat that involve little or no work but cost less than ready-made meals.", "NTA I think, mainly because your husband shouldn't be going and buying bakery food when you guys are short on money, just because he's too lazy to make toast or a sandwich. \n\nHowever, if his alternative choice is to simply not eat unless it's made for and presented to him, you don't need to make that your problem. You don't \"have to\" make breakfast and lunch for him. He's an adult. If he'd rather not eat than make a piece of toast, fine.\n\nIf you're really determined that he eat, so much so that you'll make it for him, that's your choice. But in that case, why not just make him some toast or a quick sandwich at lunchtime instead of hurting yourself making elaborate meals? He doesn't need a full meal at lunchtime if your mum's making one for dinner.", "NTA. Your husband is manipulative. He's complaining because he knows you'll cook. Focus on your baby and recover", "NTA, he should cook for you instead or buy takeaways .", "NTA. You husband is starving himself because he can\u2019t cook? Laughable. YouTube vids and tell him to make food for you from your available groceries.", "NTA, Jesus Christ", "NTA. His 'there's  no food' bleating really means 'there's no food available that doesn't involve me making it'.  He is exhausted because he's hungry and not rating properly.  Youve got 3 kids at 23, complications and a disability.  You need to be recovering right now.  He needs to stop complaining and start cooking at home. If he needs help as to what to make he can ask.", "Your husband has given up work to look after you because you have just given birth and are disabled. He should be doing that - looking after you. That means feeding you and the kids breakfast and lunch.  He can then eat some of that. What are you eating if he is not stepping up? NTA but stop feeding him.", "This is absurd.  He\u2019s really willing to just not eat instead of making simple meals?  Let him.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe is fine with what he is eating. The kids are fed.  So stop being a controlling AH.", "YTA...not sure why someone on full disability is pumping out kids that they can't afford or take care of without help from Mom. Husband is working and helping  out with the kids. (Based on OP comment that husband is falling asleep with kids).\nOP needs to stop nagging and get therapy for their anxiety. Controlling others is not the way to make the situation better. Perhaps OP should get a bulletin board and spend time documenting the household spending habits to show the loss of money from dining out or change to to separate finances. Just stop nagging OP!", "I'm not going to say your an AH.... But just let the man not eat so long as he's not wasting money buying food.\n\nIf he's happy enough to go hungry until dinner then let him. Just so long as the kids are fed.\n\nI had Ana would c section with my first and lived in the nicu for the first 2 weeks of her life. Husband figured himself out at home. It's not how I would have wanted to live my life but ultimately he's an adult and can fend for himself.\n\nYou worry about you for now.", "NTA\n So he would rather starve than have to make his own food.  He is basically saying I would rather die than cook. The long-term side effects can even lead to a heart attack, among other things.  That is not something he should be placed on you even when you are not recovering from surgery. Being a responsible parent also means taking care of yourself so you are able to care for your children.\nPlease tell me he doesn't drive. If he does, I wouldn't let the kids in the car with him until he fixes himself.", "NTA.  If he just wasn\u2019t eating, I\u2019d say leave him be and let him be hungry but going out and spending money you don\u2019t have because he won\u2019t fix food for himself makes him a huge AH.\n\nFWIW, I had three c-sections with no complications and my husband took over meal prep for the weeks after I got home.  Gourmet meals they were not but he made do.", "NTA.", "INFO: what do you eat?", "Nta...this weaponized incompetence...tell him you can't afford this and he needs to learn", "Why can\u2019t he do this?", "This is an option but OP really shouldn\u2019t have to put the mental work into this because her husband is unwilling to even try to feed himself. She noted he won\u2019t even make himself toast, I don\u2019t foresee him making a sandwich.", "Haha what? He can do that himself.", "Sorry, generic you (as in you guys), not meant for OP to do by herself.  It sounds like his learned helplessness may prevent him from doing it by himself, or he would have before going hungry.", "I meant that as a generic you (and have accordingly edited it to \u201cyou guys\u201d).\n\nIt\u2019s a pathetic kind of helplessness to not be able to assemble a simple meal for himself, but you\u2019re right, he may have that bad a degree of learned helplessness.  Helping him plan his food may help bridge him into having more ability to take care of himself.", "Obviously he can\u2019t.  Sometimes people who have learned helplessness need to be guided into better self-sufficiency, because left on their own they just keep falling on their faces.", "Oh I\u2019m sorry for being too literal Lolol.  I thought you meant her. \ud83d\ude02", "That\u2019s the thing, I think he\u2019s able to. Just chooses not to. It\u2019s not like a PB and J or a cooked egg and toast is hard to make. I\u2019ve been doing it since I was like 10!", "Well sucks for him then. She\u2019s not his mom", "Probably because society has said women are responsible for this stuff for a long time.  I edited to make it clearer", "But it takes the planning to have the things in the house to do that - when you were a kid, your parents did that.  Helping husband become more self-sufficient makes a lot more sense than just watching him fail over and over.\n\nMy husband often forgets to eat (or eats badly) if he doesn\u2019t meal plan.  If I remind him to meal plan and add it to the weekly shopping list (he shops, not me), it cuts his forgetting or getting takeout/prepared food for lunch by a lot - in a good week, he doesn\u2019t do either at all, overall I think it gets him to average about 80% feeding himself better.  He needs to be nudged to do his meal planning the same day we do our dinner meal planning, because he won\u2019t remember on his own.  I do occasionally wonder how he survived before me, but the truth is that he did it exactly as you\u2019d think: often missing meals or eating crap and procrastinating taking care of himself or his home until he was forced to.  At this point, I\u2019m pretty severely physically disabled and he finally got diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago, so we\u2019ve settled into an understanding that I generally make the to-do list and keep adding things as needed, and he does what\u2019s on the list.", "Sometimes being a good partner means helping your partner learn to help themself.  It hurts you both when one of you is repeatedly falling on their face.", "Teamwork  \u2764\ufe0f"]}
