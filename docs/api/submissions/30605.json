{"id": 30605, "submission_id": "17r0u18", "title": "AITA for leaving up a picture that angers my MIL?", "selftext": "I (25F) married my husband Joe (27M) four months ago. We dated all through high school and college, so we have been in each other's lives and in each other's families for quite some time. Joe's father died when we were seniors in high school, and his sister Jill died 3 years ago. Since then, his mother, Jean, has been, in my opinion, unhinged. I cannot imagine her sense of loss and I know everyone has their own grief process so I really try not to judge, but she makes everything about her grief. She didn't come to our college graduation because she would never get to see Jill graduate from college. We try to be especially kind to her on mother's day, but she spends HOURS at the cemetery and gets very irate if we leave before she's ready to. She insists we give our first child her husband's name as a first or middle name and gets angry when we say we'll name our future children as we see fit. There have been other incidents, too.\n\nShe's done so much to push Joe away while also relying on him for emotional and sometimes financial support. They have a very unhealthy relationship now.\n\nIt came to a head when we were wedding planning. I invited her to come wedding dress shopping with me, my mom, my grandma, and my maid of honor. I told her she did not need to come if it was going to be painful for her, but she said she would be happy to. To all our surprise, she came and brought a wedding gown that Jill had purchased to save for her own wedding someday. She said it would help her if I tried it on and I did, which made her cry, but then she insisted that it was my dress and I didn't need to get another one. After multiple refusals, she pouted the rest of the time. It was so awkward for everyone.\n\nThis led to a lot of drama, to the point where Joe (and me, but mostly Joe) did not want her at the wedding because we couldn't trust her to not cause some kind of scene and because we thought it would be terrible for her mental health. We asked her not to come and she agreed not to. I got to have a dance with my dad, and my mom surprised Joe by stepping in for a mother's dance with him. They smiled and laughed the whole time. It was the most special part of our wedding, to me.\n\nI recently changed my FB cover photo to a picture of Joe and my mom dancing and laughing. Jean saw this and has been coming at us for it, saying it's just a reminder that she was excluded from her son's wedding day. I told her I'm not taking it down and that if she doesn't want to see it, she can simply not look at my FB. She says I am inconsiderate of her feelings and that I am an AH for this because \"it drives another wedge\" between her and her son.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699491321, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17r0u18/aita_for_leaving_up_a_picture_that_angers_my_mil/", "score": 6950, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You guys need to keep her at arms length until she gets into grief counseling with a therapist and meets with a therapist long term.\n\nUntil she is working with a grief therapist, every event will become like your wedding did. You want this dealt with before a child is in the picture. Truly.\n\nNTA", "Gentle ESH. She sounds annoying AF and very self centered.\n\nBut per the photo - I think it is (hopefully unintentionally) spiteful to put up a picture where your mom served in his mom's place in the wedding. Yes, she misbehaved herself out of an invitation, but she kept her word and agreed not to come. In her place, I would think it's pretty mean of you to display a picture that will always remind her that she wasn't part of such a big day in his life, esp because it's YOUR FB photo of your husband and mom. A family wedding photo where she isn't there is more justifiable. Idk, I think it seems petty.", "I was with you until the end. You\u2019d be well within your rights to go NC or LC, or hell, even just block her on social media. But you *haven\u2019t* done those things and this just seems spiteful. She\u2019s clearly unwell and while that doesn\u2019t mean you have to tolerate everything, or that you can\u2019t set boundaries, that\u2019s not what this is. It\u2019s cruel. YTA.", "I'm sure I will be voted down.  I have much sympathy for you.  You were very kind to invite her dress shopping, and I am so sorry that backfired.  I understand why you didn't feel she could come to the wedding, but I do think a public posting of a substitute mother is a little disrespectful, knowing the extent of her pain. \n\nCan you not just enjoy the photo in the private space of your own home?  I've been that person excluded.  It hurts.  You can't fix what's broken, but you can avoid heaping more on the pile.", "I was with you till the photo comment. YTA that\u2019s messed up. Basically taunting her", "I think it's quite awful to use a picture of Joe and your Mom dancing and laughing.  I think it's in poor taste.    I would think she could benefit tremendously if she got therapy.  It wouldn't be a bad idea to get family therapy.   \n\nShe is still grieving the death of her daughter.   Expecting you to wear her Jill's wedding dress is weird.   If you are concerned about her mental health then why post a picture of your mom laughing and dancing with your husband?", "Info:  How does Joe feel about this?", "YTA only because it\u2019s weird to have THAT as your profile pic at all\u2026 seems like you don\u2019t mind rubbing it in her face. \nI seriously doubt THAT was THE most special picture out of all of them, let alone you\u2019re apparently not even in it. Super weird behavior all around. \nShe\u2019s clearly struggling and needs mental health help. Don\u2019t make it worse.", "YTA.  I agree she's in desperate need of grief therapy, but posting that photo and not taking it down is beyond cruel.", "YTA. \n\nShe was excluded from her only living child's wedding and then was faced with a photo of your mom playing his mom for the mother/son dance. I can understand excluding her due to drama, but to then throw it in her face is pretty cruel. It opens up questions and suspicions about if there was actual drama caused by her (and not you and your family).\n\nYou are 100% inconsiderate at the very least.", ">I recently changed my FB cover photo to a picture of Joe and my mom dancing and laughing...I told her I'm not taking it down and that if she doesn't want to see it, she can simply not look at my FB.\n\nYTA for the exact question you're asking about Facebook.  This isn't a referendum on the history of your relationship with her.\n\nYour MIL complied with the request not to come to the wedding, there is no need for you to rub it in her face that she 1)missed out of seeing her last child married; and 2) some other mother shared that moment on the dance floor. Surely there were other photos you could have chosen.\n\n[OP, the fact that you not only have refused to take down the photo, and are now arguing with every comment on the thread that is challenging you on this...you clearly aren't at all open to even the smallest possibility that you are in the wrong here. Unbelievable.]", "YTA for the picture. She didn\u2019t come to the wedding as you requested and you could literally choose any other picture. She missed other milestone events, but she excluded herself from this one at your request.  Why did it have to be that picture? You might benefit from some self-reflection about that.  If she\u2019s excusing herself from such big milestones, I would be extremely concerned about the severity of her depression. You definitely should both be supportive so she doesn\u2019t get a skewed view and start to feel the people that truly love her are all on the other side. Please talk to your husband and get her some help. If she\u2019s unwilling, or slow to do so, consider speaking to your husband about seeing a therapist on his own or with you to get some strategies on how to live through feeling ignored by his mom as well as how to best support her through this.", "Sorry, but YTA.  If it was part of an album, maybe it would be fine, but to put it as the cover photo?  Even if you had a good reason to exclude her from the wedding, you don't have to rub it in her face. \n\nShe needs grief counseling or at least a support group.", "YTA, she agreed not to come and you spite her still?", "NTA although factually you both did not invite her to the wedding. She presents as having spiraled down re: her mental health, is having financial challenges and not finding healthy things to focus on. If she was not mad at this picture she would be made at something else.  Each action you described has the motivation to 'control' something which may have been a behavior pattern in place prior to her loses which has exasperated.  \n\nYou can't stop your life for her. Remind one another (you and hubby) about the good and positive things you do in her life because she is not capable to articulate this (at this time).  Best to you. This is not an easy path to navigate. I am sorry for your shared loss cause in essence you both also lost a bit of who she was prior to this. \n\nINFO: Was she excluded from attending the wedding?", "YTA - you're trying to pretend that you didn't have malicious intent w that photo but literally any grown adult with a brain can see that you were being petty. how nasty.", "I'm with you 100% about her not being there.  To many horror stories about MIL in the same position who make the worst most depressing speech ever about nothing to do with the bride and groom and all about their grief.  No issues with that.\nBut I've read and re-read your post and comments and they absolutely drip and ooze with resentment.  As a believer in an eye for an eye there is a place and time and this was not one of them.  You posted that pic as your cover because it felt good to get back at your MIL for all the pain she's caused you and your husband.  You kicked a lying dog while it was down and for that, YTA.  You wanted to do something personal on purpose.  Go reflect on that plz.", "YTA if she had decided on her own to not go I'd be on your side. But you asked her not to go and she respected you enough to not go and you do this?  Yeah, sorry  but definitely YTA.", "One of the hardest things in life is to lose your child. It doesn't matter how old that child is. People never \"get over it.\" They just learn to hide it and move on, but the pain is always there. You, thankfully, have never experienced this. Yes, she is a handful, but please give her grace, and maybe your husband can get her into counselling.\n\nYTA for having that picture up. Very passive aggressive.", "YTA. There are 100 photos you could use. Don\u2019t pick that one.", "YTA your excuse that you used that picture because they are your 2 favorite people is BS. I am sure you have pictures of them not at the wedding. You used this one to stick it to your MIL and make sure she knows she was replaced. \n\nAnd the fact that she was nice enough to not try and force an invite to the wedding so it could be all about you and not what she has lost makes it even nastier.", "YTA. My MIL is crazy, pretty sure she uses my husband as a substitute for the one she doesn\u2019t have. It\u2019s disturbing. She way oversteps everything. I can\u2019t deal with even being around her. And I would never do something this cruel to her.", "YTA She stayed away, and you still rub it in her face.  You\u2019re a nasty person, and you know exactly what you\u2019ve done.  I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re posting here.  Just a little extra kick for you?", "YTA. Both because it was an insensitive move to use this pic as your cover photo, but also because from your comments we gather that you didn\u2019t come here open to judgement at all. You were so sure you were right that now you can\u2019t even accept that you weren\u2019t. Part of asking AITA is being able to take it on board when the answer is yes.", "YTA, we all know the coy public Facebook photo trick.", "YTA. \n\nThat was thoughtless at best and calculated spite at worst. \n\nYour doubling down implies the latter. She respected your wishes to not attend, even though a part of her probably wanted to be there. \n\nIt says a lot that the emotionally compromised grieving mother and widow has more respect for your wishes than you do hers.", "She sounds like my Grandma. She lost my Aunt as a teenager in 1956(ish) before that from what I understand Grandma was a full of life an happy go lucky person. She had a complete breakdown and never recovered. My advice is don\u2019t poke the bear, but still give her an in to be part of her sons, and yours life.", "Let\u2019s be real here - you HAD to pick that picture? Come on..", "Seems spiteful and petty. I understand your frustration though", "ESH", "YTA. Put aside your frustration with her \u201cdrama\u201d and see her as a human being for just a minute. She lost her husband and daughter and was uninvited to her son\u2019s wedding because she is falling apart with grief. Is it really that much to ask you to not rub salt into her wounds?", "I think you have beef with your MIL and this cover photo thing seems to be the hill you're choosing to die on. I don't think this is about you wanting it to be your picture, its more about you making sure she knows that her wills or desires have no affect or power over you and you can do whatever you want. \n\nWhich is fine, but to me YTA. I don't see a reason why this photo \\*needs\\* to be your cover photo.", "YTA\n\nGood lord, that poor woman lost her daughter and husband, was in the middle of of having a mental breakdown, RESPECTED your wishes to not attend the wedding and you LITERALLY posted a picture of her son dancing with your mom in what should have been the dance with her had she been present.  You seriously don\u2019t see how petty and mean that comes off?\n\nYou could\u2019ve posted a picture of you and your husband dancing, or you and your father dancing, or you and your husband cutting your wedding cake or any other number of photos\u2026and you chose the one with the specific situation to make her feel the WORST?!\n\nThis seriously comes off like you were punishing your MiL for the wedding dress situation.  That is just brutal. From your comments I can\u2019t believe you can\u2019t see how mean and inconsiderate this comes off to her.  Change the photo on your page and apologize to that poor woman.", "YTA for the picture\n\nESH for the rest\n\nShes grieving and you are indeed loudly moving on with your life. That picture isnt necessary and you know it.\n\nYes she needs therapy; if she had schizophrenia, would you put up a photo that triggers that as well?\n\nAdmit it, this part is you being a bitch. Try and take SOME Of the stress out of your husbands life, even if it makes you sweat, make the effort.", "YTA- this woman is obviously going through a LOT, and while this doesn't give her license to ruin your wedding preparations and day due to her coping or lack thereof, it does NOT give you license to rub salt IN HER WOUNDS by making this picture YOUR PROFILE PIC. \nDouble YTA. You kind of suck.", "YTA for posting this photo because you do know that your mil is mentally and emotionally fragile, and posting this picture is very insensitive. What\u2019s the motive behind you posting this particular picture and not one of you and your husband? It\u2019s like you\u2019re rubbing it in your mil\u2019s face, almost like it\u2019s intentional. You might want do an inner examination of your feelings of resentment towards her, because you are the healthier person compared to her. I\u2019d take it down and apologize for hurting her, it\u2019s creating drama and it\u2019s disrespectful to your mil and your husband, even if he agrees with you. Grow up", "Sorry but YTA, she lost her husband and then daughter and the you excluded her from her sons wedding?  Where\u2019s your compassion?  Yes it sounds like she\u2019s had a mental health break down, who would blame her, seems your husband is only thinking of you now though and forgetting the mum who raised him", "Soft YTA.  Yes, she is unhinged. But she is grieving and doesn't know how. So your choosing a photo that shows her son moving on with life and being happy with another family while she feels alone in her grief is just mean. Don't be mean. Be kind. Post the photo but hide it from her. That's so easy to do. You don't have to alter your life for unreasonable demands but you also don't have to rub her face in your happiness when you know she is still grieving", "ESH. You guys were good up until you described the picture. She's literally been replaced in the picture. I'm sure it was a good moment, but is that really one of the images you want others to remember most about that day? That she wasn't present for her role and so your mom replaced her? Maybe you want people to remember that her son was happy she wasn't there?", "YTA. That specific photo? As a cover photo? I was with you right up until that point, but from an outsider\u2019s perspective, it seems petty and cruel. This woman needs grief therapy, not a reminder that she was asked not to come to her son\u2019s wedding and another mother had to step in to fill her place. I was going to go with N T A, but this feels more like E S H  or  YTA.", "Nasty to have that picture up on Facebook.  All else has my sympathy but that is just cruel.  Shame!", "While on your MIL's behalf, I can understand how this can be unfair for her. However, I can imagine that if she did attend the wedding, she would have made it another reason to feel uncomfortable and sad. \n\nShe really needs to see a grief counselor. She doesn't realize how her grief over her husband and daughter has affected her relationship with Joe. She's skipped out on his birthdays, college graduation, and has basically turned happy events into things revolving around her grief. \n\nI may be the minority, but NTA. I say this because I hope your MIL can take this moment as a sign to what she\u2019s been doing. If she wanted to be there at the wedding for Joe, she would have pushed through and supported him. I genuinely hope she gets the help she needs.", "MIL needs some counseling.", "Look, I believe you that the woman is incredibly difficult to deal with, and she is going to be an ongoing problem.\n\nBut I do think that prominently displaying a picture of her son dancing with his MIL at the wedding she was excluded from is unnecessary, this is a case where doing a minor thing will cost you nothing and benefit someone else a bit.  No, it won't change her or stop her from being difficult, but why not make the picture less prominent.", "She is using her grief as a manipulation, and she needs to see a counselor to work through it for the mental health of everyone involved.\n\nHOWEVER, that photo feels really, really mean. She respected your wishes for her not to attend. She didn't boycott the wedding. You didn't want her there (which is absolutely understandable, don't get me wrong). It's just that your mom stepped in to replace her, and now you've posted the picture ***as if his mother doesn't exist***. It doesn't matter if that is unintentional (although it really doesn't appear unintentional at all). You should take that down and keep the photo for yourself as a keepsake, and all of you should be in counseling to figure out how to deal with this situation in as healthy a way as possible.\n\nNo one gets to use their grief to make people miserable, so she is an AH for her behavior. You don't have to pour salt on the wound and make it worse, though. You are an AH for your behavior. The only person I don't feel is an AH is Joe, and he's approached AH territory. A group photo is fine, but choosing that particular photo is a bit much imo.\n\nETA: changing my judgment from ESH to YTA, after reading your comments. This was intentional to spite her, and no one is afforded the right to hurt anyone purposefully like this.", "ESH ... hundreds of pics you could have chosen. You made the big leaps talking to her about skipping the wedding and she complied without fuss or drama. How hard would it have been to pick any other picture- perhaps one of you and your new fackin husband?? - instead for you FB shit? \n\nYou didn't have to. But you could of...", "ESH. as you said the grief has made her unhinged and that doesn\u2019t excuse her behavior. *however* she did comply with your request not come which was probably a big deal for her and a great moment of self awareness and while you may not have intended to be hurtful you\u2019re now being purposely spiteful. in the end if she does get counseling for her grief and comes to regret how she behaved i feel like you will really regret rubbing salt in the wounds of someone who acted out of grief. again it doesn\u2019t excuse what she has done, but there\u2019s no need for you to stoop to the level of someone who\u2019s not actually in their right mind. i also fully understand where you are coming from. my husbands father died three years before i met him. and my MIL let her grief constantly overshadow being there for her son. she refused to participate in many activities even though she was the only parent he had left. it\u2019s very upsetting to watch because you just want your husband to have the one person he has left to show up for them, so i absolutely understand how happy it must have made you to see your mom dance with your husband. but that can be just for you to enjoy. maybe just a small canvas print of the picture for home? i saw some other people mention this and i agree that this opportunity can be used as a bargaining chip \u201ci apologize if this picture hurt your feelings, however you not being included on our wedding day was a result of your own actions. if you would like to avoid further disappointment from missing future milestones such as grandkids etc. you need to take accountability and get help for your grief that is causing these issues. this is non negotiable for us. if you choose to continue as you are we will not go out of our way to protect your feelings when you are left out in the future.\u201d", "YTA. Shes obviously unstable, you\u2019re just adding to it.", "YTA \n\nWhy would you do that?? Surely you know it would upset a mother to see her son dancing with a substitute mom at his wedding, from which she was disinvited!!\n\nYou got away with it at the time since MIL didn\u2019t see it. Plastering it everywhere is rubbing salt in her wound!\n\nGod preserve you the pain she has felt, even if you\u2019ve been unkind to this widow.", "YTA. That was incredibly insensitive and mean. Doesn\u2019t matter how big of a nutjob your MIL is. What you did was just plain cruel.\n\nGrow up.", "Quite an odd photo to pic for YOUR FB\u2026 how about  a pic of you and your husband?", "YTA you know what you did. I feel bad for your husband.", "YTA this is clearly taunting a mentally ill person.", "NTA \n\nI  think a lot of people voting y t a aren't really understanding that she would have been there to dance with her son if she had done literally anything to address her grief. \n\nLike, yeah, everyone grieves differently and the amount of time you grieve for is different for everyone. But you can't keep hurting people because of your grief and then be upset they don't wanna be around you. \n\nTrying to get OP to try on Jill's dress was so far from ok and literally no one voting YTA is even mentioning it but you're up in arms about how a Facebook picture is spitting in the moms face. I don't get it. I do get why you feel for her. I don't get how you can say OP is the asshole, though.", "YTA. He\u2019s mom was clearly unbearable but that\u2019s probably the most \u2018rub it in your face\u2019 thing you could have done. The dance with your mother was lovely.. you certainly didn\u2019t need to post it as a profile pic :-/ I was on your side but your behavior is downright disappointing.", "This is a difficult situation for everyone, and there's really no right or wrong answer. Posting the picture is inconsiderate. However, there's only so much a person can take.  It seems like MIL has pushed the limits.  You and your husband might want to seek counseling on setting healthy boundaries while trying to support her grief without enabling.  MIL definitely needs therapy, but it doesn't sound like she's ready.  I'm sure this is stressful.", "From what I am understanding, while it feels so harsh to type out, she really does need to focus on Joe and realizing that he is his own person. Along with any of your future children and you. Her husband and Jill were both their own people, and I\u2019m sure they would not want their passing to be pressed on everyone who is still living. \n\nIt\u2019s like, I get everyone processes grief differently. But it is selfish to constantly push that onto everyone else in her life and even pout when she doesn\u2019t get her way. I\u2019m sure Joe is hurting too. Why not come together and feel what they need to feel, instead of try to make everyone live the same lives that have already came and gone? I feel like she isn\u2019t acting selfish, but she needs to maybe get out of her head a little bit and process the world around her instead of dwelling on the past.", "Take the high road, and change the pic. The loss of a child is unfathomable to me. If anything happened to one of my kids, I'd never recover, and I'm known to be a strong rock to friends and family. \n\nI won't pass judgment, but try putting yourself in her shoes.", "I just hope that your children gets raised better and dont do this to you in the future. Excluding a mother from her own son's marriage is vile! Then posting that video knowing that the mother would see it and be hurt! You just posted that video because of your lack of morals. YTA.", "Eh ESH honestly. She needs some serious grief counseling, she doesn\u2019t sound well. The picture though, I understand the picture exists and it\u2019s probably beautiful, however it is rather tone deaf and mean to have it front and center where she will see it all the time.", "YTA, from the start i got an off vibe from you bc of the language you were using, calling a grieving mother \u2018unhinged\u2019 and criticising her for staying at the grave for hours? You do not know anything abt her pain, that is just entirely unsensitive and you\u2019re making MIL horror stories sound justified", "There are better hills to die on.", "My opinion changed when I found where and what the picture was. YTA for that. \nYes she clearly is having major mental health issues, she needs to be in therapy. She needs to get her shit together not to destroy her only  living child\u2019s relationship.\nBut that photo is rubbing her nose in the fact she never got to see her children\u2019s weddings. If it was in a group of photos and she saw it. That would be one thing. But not the cover photo. Intentional or not, it\u2019s a bit of a slap in the face. \n\nI hope for all your sake she gets the help she needs. But shoving her down more is just going to push her off the edge when she needs help. I\u2019m not saying you have to be the one to pull her out, but adding more fuel to the fire is going to make everyone burn.", "I get where the MIL is coming from. It would be a simple thing to change", "YTA. Take the picture down. Why do you need to use it? It's not important. Why are you so obsessed with this? You're literally talking about Facebook. Touch grass????", "Okay, I just want to make sure I've got this right.\n\nMILs husband died while you were seniors in high school so your husband was probably 18, yes? (Technically not a child btw) and then what happened? You guys finished high school and went running off to college?\n\nOr what happened here? You say his sister died 3 years ago, but MIL didn't come to college graduation.. three years ago your husband would have been 24 so did he take time off between school or did he just take longer to graduate? Because, honestly, if y'all went running off to college 6 months after MILs husband died, I can see why she might be a little distant? Also, how old was his sister, was she older or younger? The whole dress thing is weird to me, like who buys a wedding dress to save for who knows how many years in the first place?\n\nAnyway, I'm going to assume while you all are off at college or wherever you were, Jill became a rock for your MIL and then suddenly she was actually alone. Or that's the way the timeline is reading to me.\n\nAnd then, what happened after Jill died? You all obviously went back to school at some point. So how much were you really there for? \n\nETA how long after Jill dying was college graduation?? Again, if it was six months after the fact, she probably wasn't ready. That's a huge factor on if she was actually not trying when she chose not to attend that event.\n\nOn top of that, the way you come across, you have absolutely no tact. Are your future children's names up to you? Absolutely. However, instead of just telling her that you will do whatever you want, you could have said something like 'we would love to honor FIL in some way and when the time comes we will consider how we are going to do it.' Again, the dress thing is weird to me but you did not have to wear it, that wasn't wrong. Again, TACT. you say you refused many times, and yes, 'no' is a full sentence, but something like: 'I'd love to come up with a way to incorporate Jill into the wedding, but I'm not comfortable with wearing her dress.'

We dated all through high school and college, so we have been in each other's lives and in each other's families for quite some time. Joe's father died when we were seniors in high school, and his sister Jill died 3 years ago. Since then, his mother, Jean, has been, in my opinion, unhinged. I cannot imagine her sense of loss and I know everyone has their own grief process so I really try not to judge, but she makes everything about her grief. She didn't come to our college graduation because she would never get to see Jill graduate from college. We try to be especially kind to her on mother's day, but she spends HOURS at the cemetery and gets very irate if we leave before she's ready to. She insists we give our first child her husband's name as a first or middle name and gets angry when we say we'll name our future children as we see fit. There have been other incidents, too.\n\nShe's done so much to push Joe away while also relying on him for emotional and sometimes financial support. They have a very unhealthy relationship now.\n\nIt came to a head when we were wedding planning. I invited her to come wedding dress shopping with me, my mom, my grandma, and my maid of honor. I told her she did not need to come if it was going to be painful for her, but she said she would be happy to. To all our surprise, she came and brought a wedding gown that Jill had purchased to save for her own wedding someday. She said it would help her if I tried it on and I did, which made her cry, but then she insisted that it was my dress and I didn't need to get another one. After multiple refusals, she pouted the rest of the time. It was so awkward for everyone.\n\nThis led to a lot of drama, to the point where Joe (and me, but mostly Joe) did not want her at the wedding because we couldn't trust her to not cause some kind of scene and because we thought it would be terrible for her mental health. I got to have a dance with my dad, and my mom surprised Joe by stepping in for a mother's dance with him. They smiled and laughed the whole time. It was the most special part of our wedding, to me.\n\nI recently changed my FB cover photo to a picture of Joe and my mom dancing and laughing. Jean saw this and has been coming at us for it, saying it's just a reminder that she was excluded from her son's wedding day. I told her I'm not taking it down and that if she doesn't want to see it, she can simply not look at my FB. She says I am inconsiderate of her feelings and that I am an AH for this because \"it drives another wedge\" between her and her son. Again, this is a photo w'ere talking about.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She makes holidays miserable. \n\nI'd suggest talking with your husband about this.  If he is willing to go either LC/NC, you should plan how to tell MIL. Together or if he wants, just him.

It\u2019s understandable that there are frustrations with her behaviour and she definitely needs grief counselling to sort out her own mental health issues. \nHOWEVER, YTA because you likely would have had over 100 pictures from the wedding and you chose the one where your mum was in his mums place at the wedding that she wasn\u2019t invited to. \nThe wedding dress saga? That\u2019s on her and she should have accepted you didn\u2019t want to wear the dress she offered instead of pushing you on. But I can\u2019t imagine her heartbreak at not being invited to her sons wedding yet she still chose to abide by your decision to not have her there. \n\nTake the picture down.

Your MIL\u2019s behaviour is unhinged and she needs help, but real family and friends stay supportive during someone\u2019s worst moments. Instead, because she brings the mood down, you cut her out. Life goes on and you should be entitled to happy times, but you also, as her new daughter in law, should understand that she is in hell and be willing to rough it out with her at times.\n\nShe should have been there at the wedding, even if she would have found it hard and cried and made a scene she should have been there.  My mom is going to be this way at my wedding when I walk down the aisle without my dad but I would never imagine cutting her out, instead we will honor his memory during the speech and a few sad tears will be shed but that\u2019s a part of life. \n\nThe picture you uploaded is very insensitive given the circumstances, you appear to show no real empathy for her situation.", "Grief is a horrible thing. I can honestly say I\u2019ve seen some amazing people change and deteriorate rapidly after experiencing grief- especially the loss of a child. I am so sorry you are affected like this and it\u2019s kind of you that you even try to imagine where she is coming from. I think grief can change people\u2019s brain chemistry and really affect people in strange ways. This sounds insane, but sometimes they feel alone and are really stuck in a place where they can\u2019t process things and their life has essentially just stopped. Your mil was not right to do the things she did like push Jill\u2019s wedding dress on you, but I think she desperately needs someone to talk to. Hopefully she is in therapy, but beyond that, and I know it seems like a hard task, but try to be there for her. Take her to lunch and ask her about Jill- ask her what she misses most about her and ask her how her life has changed without her. You will gain understanding and your MIL will have an opportunity to process some of her grief and you will bond in the process. I promise your husband will be so grateful for your understanding and any attempt you make- after all, that\u2019s his Mom- she helped make him the man you love. I know it\u2019s so hard to extend grace and support to someone who has wronged you, but maybe reframe it and think that it\u2019s not her, but grief that has wronged all of you.

What she's doing right now is trying to get that emotional support again while disregarding the stress it puts on your husband. Nip that in the butt immediately!

AND for you and him!", "NTA from me. I replied to another person initially but I really do not understand the Y TA votes and the justification of the photo for them.

Obviously you\u2019re now aware that your MIL had her feelings hurt by that, so you could take it down to be kind, but it\u2019s MILs job to regulate her emotional reactions. It doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s done anything to manage her grief and is content with selfishly making every situation about herself. She\u2019s did that by extrapolating you having that photo on your profile into some kind of dig at her. Again, some people are calling you TA for not taking it down once she told you her feelings were hurt, but I disagree. \n\nAlso, truly do not understand why people are so fixated on the parent dances.

They totally could have been dancing together during a time not specifically set aside for the mother/son dance, no?\n\nEdit: read through some of your comments and I just want to acknowledge another point you brought up\u2014 at no point has MIL had any care in her heart for your husband during this process. Grief is intense but it is not an excuse for her to treat her son horribly or for her to be so overcome that she cannot function day to day.

She has gone through loss so great, you should get on your knees and pray that you never have to feel that. But instead, you berate and belittle her. You exclude her.

That had to hurt, yet his mom isn't even recognizing that and making it about her.

Sure, if that was OP's intention, she should come to terms with it, and sit with whether the consequences for herself or Joe are worth it.

Shes trying to reconcile it but she cant, nothing can undo the hurt and void she is feeling. And seeing that picture, its like reaffirmation that SHE ISNT NEEDED OR WANTED BY HER LIVING SON. This is making her mental health worse, not better. This poor woman, needs professional help, because family can only be a crutch for so long. I feel sorry for her. Shes only going to get worse health wise. If you want her there for when you eventually have kids of your own, you need to help her mend that void, take her to therapy, take family therapy sessions with her, listen to her and also apologise for the photo.

But this isn't the way to begin to assert that or move in a healthier direction.

Not the same as profile pic.\n\nBut yes we do care, very much, but we have had to come to a point where we either continue to let her continue to hurt Joe and cause friction, or start to move on with his life, our life.", "Despite people\u2019s beliefs that I\u2019m a cold, heartless witch, I am taking things into consideration.\n\nIt\u2019s hard because she is very controlling, and this would be another example of her using her grief to control people, which will only reinforce her to do it again.\n\nI genuinely love the picture. Joe loves the picture.", "> I don\u2019t know your exact motivations for it\n\nI said it right in the post. It was a very meaningful moment for Joe. I was glad he got to have it and proud of my mom for being the one to give him that.\n\nAnd he loves the picture too. I have asked what his thoughts are, he said it\u2019s time to stop letting her use her grief to control people, but he has left the choice up to me.", "You can choose not to and set the audience if you do.", "You seem to forget that he also lost his father and sister, and she has not supported him. But that\u2019s fine I guess.", "Except see her comment where she wanted to highlight that her mom fulfilled the role of 'mom' for her husband.", "Exactly haha. I'm sure they have tons of other lovely wedding photos. And they still have that photo of OP's husband and mom to cherish for themselves. Displaying it very specifically (choosing it above other weddings photos) on OP's fb page is OP's right at the end of the day, but she could also just have a little consideration for her MIL's severe grief and use a different photo, which wouldn't cost OP anything. There are definitely reasonable boundaries to draw and it's not that the MIL can do whatever without consequence -- and clearly they've drawn some of those boundaries as they disinvited her from the wedding. But this is one of those things that just seems to needlessly cause pain and prod at a sore spot. That might not be what OP intended, but now that she's aware, would it really take anything away from her to just use a different wedding photo? It's not like the MIL is asking for her to burn that picture. It's just hard to see.", "Because it\u2019s OPs facebook!  The only person who gets to decide what\u2019s okay to post on it is OP (and FB algorithms I guess).  If someone doesn\u2019t like something you post on your own FB they can just scroll on, or even hide the post for themselves (do that with some political stuff that comes by my feed now and then).  MIL would only see a cover photo if she actually went to OPs page, and then only for a second, so if she doesn\u2019t like it she can just not go to her page.  OP has no moral obligations to only share photos that will make MIL happy (or less sad, because I think happy is to strong of a word).  People keep forgetting that personal FB pages are just that, personal.  If you don\u2019t like it, block it or unfriend the person or hide it.  But you don\u2019t get to dictate what others post", "She did a normal thing - posting a pic that gave her joy. Brides do that. If this was a recent thing, then I might be more sympathetic, but MIL needs to get help - she needed to have done that a long time ago. Son and DIL have tried, but how long do they tip toe around, not doing normal things? They have a life to live. MIL is the one setting fires.", "As is said many times here and elsewhere, people are ultimately responsible for managing their own mental health.\n\nIt may be that her daughter's death has made her unable to control her emotions, she may in fact be mentally ill. If that's the case, we can feel sorry for her up to a point - that point being where she starts making other people miserable. She's well into that territory.", "Yeah, that all fucking sucks - I\u2019m sorry you and your husband are having to put up with it, and for so long with no end in sight.\n\nWhether you leave the picture up or take it down,  whether you help her get help herself or just cut ties altogether - WHATEVER YOU DO - be sure you and your husband are on the same page and communicating effectively. This is a big test for your young marriage and has all the classic ingredients for creating rifts in relationships\u2026From what I can tell it sounds like he\u2019s been in lock step with you so far, just remember that it is his mom, and sometimes guys are dumb, and we do and say things we don\u2019t want to do just to try and make the ones we care about less upset.\n\nI don\u2019t think YTA for feeling like you need to stand your ground on this latest complaint from her but I do think YTA for not being able to recognize how hurtful that must have been for her to see.\n\nTake care and best of luck to you!", "No, of course not. Your MIL is undeniably abusive to your husband and needs to work through her issues. You have every right to be upset, hell, to hate her for everything she\u2019s put your family through. I hate her too and I don\u2019t know her! But of all the battles to pick, the specific question you asked is about putting up a photo that doesn\u2019t even feature you as your FB profile pic, and which - whether intentionally or not - does twist the screw a bit on the fact that she missed her son\u2019s wedding, and that someone who\u2019s obviously superior her is willing to step in and fill her shoes. Such that she\u2019s probably wondering why she bothered to comply with your one (reasonable) request. If you don\u2019t gaf about what she thinks or what your husband thinks she thinks, then you do you. But if you do care about either of those things then it seems like a hill that may not be worth dying on. Not going to call you an asshole\u2026but food for thought.", "I understand your point and there\u2019s lots of valid stuff there but this is an easy one. The photo obviously upsets her, quite possibly embarrasses her and so having it up is not helpful to you or the overall situation. So make it your screensaver or whatever instead. You can still enjoy the photo. Are you really on Facebook that much looking at your cover photo? You can say to her, I understand it may have upset you and that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t enjoy that photo but in an effort to support you I\u2019m choosing to enjoy it privately. \n\nGrief is a funny thing. Sometimes we miss someone so much and we want to maintain that relationship alive so much and the outside world threatens that old reality. So people fold into themselves in a way and everything outside of that is a reminder of what could have been, what will never be. She may need someone to remind her that hey that is gone and we\u2019re still here but in less of an intervention type manner with ultimatums and more of a I\u2019m still here and I need you kind of way. That might look like holding her hand for the whole day at a cemetery. That might also mean sending someone to make sure she gets dressed and driven to a graduation because her son also is hurting and needs here. With encouragement and practice, that person can become more present and less attached to the grief. Whenever she brings something up\u2026like the dress for example, Joe could say \u201c I understand why you might feel that way because Jill never got a chance to wear this dress but do you think Jill would have wanted us to feel sadness because of everything that is attached to this dress or be happy because it\u2019s my wedding day? This was her dress for her day and we don\u2019t get to take that from her. I\u2019m sure she would have wanted you to be happy for me on this day instead of being sad because she\u2019s gone.\u201d Acknowledge her feelings and their validity and then remind her that he also has feelings about whatever the important event and he can both miss her without compromising joy on this day\u201d \n\nHow is your husband processing the losses? Is he just avoiding bringing them up at all or does he take time to acknowledge them? It can be triggering if she feels they are lost to everyone but her, then comments like the grave pissing will come in. Instead try bringing up happy associations that acknowledge them - ie. can you believe this boat? Dad would have loved it, remember how he used to take me fishing? Or I like doing this because it reminds me of dad and helps me feel close to him remember how he loved a good party? I really miss them mom and I\u2019m so glad I still have you and that\u2019s why I need you to be there for me and to have the best of you not just the sad bits.\n\nIt is slow progress and honestly the two of them should go to therapy together. Obviously the above are just some examples and his therapist can make suggestions based on the actual history and feelings that come up.", "If you see a sign that says \"dangerous bear, do not enter\" and instead of leaving it alone you throw rocks at it to piss it off, that means YTA.\n\nEverybody here knows your MIL is a dangerous bear. But when you told her not to show up she stayed away. Why throw rocks?", "Of course it's her choice. She can also choose to be kind. Why didn't she use a picture of her and her dad dancing? Or one of her and her new husband? She chose one that she knew her MIL would see and she knew how her MIL would react.", "Glad to hear you might have gained some perspective from this post. You are still acting pretty defensive. Tbh I did the same when I was around your age. You probably don't like hearing that, but anyway, my advice is to start learning how to admit you're wrong without feeling the need to drag the other person down at the same time. You posted on AITA, of course people are going to make judgements based on little information. Some of those judgements might hit the mark and some might miss. If you're feeling upset, take a break and check notifications tomorrow. \n\nThere's posts of people who feel you're NTA too, and lots of people have sympathy for your situation.

I know it is an option from when I have changed mine.", "Your cover photo shows up in your newsfeed when you choose to make it a cover photo. Then, it shows up again every. single. time. someone comments on it, even YEARS down the road. Honestly it's weird that you think that single moment was the \"most special\" of your entire wedding, the purpose of which is to join yourself and your husband together, separating yourselves from your original nuclear family and becoming your own nuclear family.                                            You sound VERY angry and frustrated at your MIL, which with your history with her might be fair, but you could have leveraged your wedding by telling her she wasn't invited unless she started therapy.", "When you change your cover photo sends it out to all your friends as a post.\nShe\u2019s probably more upset because she explained it is upsetting and it\u2019s still up so she may feel invalidated.", "Cover pic vs profile pic is not an important distinction in this context. \n\nI think your husband cares and you don't. \n\nIf you cared, you obviously wouldn't have highlighted this particular picture on social media.

She knew she couldn't be there joyously for her son because of her grief and did the honourable thing by acquiescing to your ask. That is not an example of someone being controlling- actually the opposite.\n\nYou haven't spoken of her with any sincere compassion. I hope you never lose what she has lost because I think you'd realise your own cruelty and jesus that look in the mirror would hurt.", "There's not a single other photo from your own wedding that you \"genuinely love\"?", ">It was a very meaningful moment for Joe. \n\nWell then maybe Joe can use it as his cover photo. It wasn't your moment to emphasize quite frankly. Relative to your husband, your mother, and MIL anyways.

She only got one photo from her wedding that gives her joy.", "Oh for crying out loud, do you know how many photographs you get out of a wedding these days? With digital photography you get over thousand. You\u2019re telling me out of the thousand plus pictures she got that that was the one that she had to post in a prominent location? You can post pictures you want that give you joy, and it\u2019s not illegal to post one that is going to make someone upset. But OP is being deliberately obtuse if she did not think for one second that this was going to start shit. What she did wasn\u2019t illegal, but she can be an asshole for thinking that this wasn\u2019t going to be a problem. MIL needs therapy for sure, but antagonizing won\u2019t help.

That's not the case.\n\nI imagine there were tons of photos taken of that day and you decided out of all of them to use a photo on your public profile of him experiencing his \"first moments with a mother figure in 10 years\" as you describe it. The day was supposedly about your wedding, so why would you choose that particular photo when you know that his mother wasn't there, you know the situation that has led to her not being there and you know that she would see the photo? Why not a photo of the two of you celebrating, why would that not be the most special thing for you?  \n\nThat's what makes me think you did it deliberately when you already knew that she was mentally unstable.

I'm sure it is hard for you guys to watch her go through this and miss out on important life milestones you guys achieve.

If this were just a photo of many posted on Facebook, that might be one thing, but choosing to display it as your cover photo? That's really intentional and obviously going to cause a fight. \n\nNow, if you're no contact, that's different.

As for unintentional, I don't think it is. I think OP did it as a way to scare MIL into grief therapy, which is a really crappy thing to do to someone who is clearly suffering from a mental illness.

Wonder what your guests thought of that. \n\nWhat's wrong with her saying you should name your kids after his dad. Did your husband like his dad? If he did, maybe he'd want that at some point for a middle name. He might not know right now because he hasn't had enough support and therapy to know, but maybe!

He buried it deep down inside and I\u2019ve only seen him cry twice - one of those time wasn\u2019t even at the funeral while I sobbed my heart out.

It doesn't make much sense for you to put up a photo from your wedding that you weren't even in, but for it to be the one of your husband doing the mother and son dance with your mom instead of his was definitely intentional and a slap in the face. Why did you choose that photo instead of the hundreds other that I'm sure were taken?", "Yes, you are an asshole. First for excluding her from the wedding. And then reminding her that she was excluded", "I don't think you are TA. I also don't think MIL is either.\n\nMIL is obviously in a lot of emotional pain. Grieving. That may never end.\nMIL lost her child. She is acting irrationally, yes. But to her, life has been irrational since that day.\n\nI feel far more sorry for MIL than I do you. \n\nLosing a child is probably the most painful thing a parent could ever endure. I can understand how that parent would spiral into insanity.", "Info: did you put it up to be spiteful/mean? Did you do it knowing it would hurt her and do it anyways?", "YTA. As a mother who\u2019s lost her child, I couldn\u2019t imagine losing my husband as well. 10 years is nothing for the bereaved. In fact, sometimes it actually gets harder. \nI understand it\u2019s difficult to support her. But she respected your wishes and didn\u2019t come to the wedding (which was probably going to be a trigger but something she will still regret missing)\nI lost my father this year. It\u2019s only compounded my grief.  \nI\u2019m saying this not to make you be the ones to support her- I see in your comments you\u2019ve tried and you\u2019re burned out (so is she). But a little compassion goes a long way. It\u2019s a post vs her feelings. And you\u2019re choosing social media. That makes you TA in this situation. You\u2019re blessed to not know your MILs pain, as parents aren\u2019t meant to bury their children.", "YTA. Yes her behavior was unhinged but at least she complied with your request to not come to the wedding. Why would you use a photo of your husband and your mom as your FB cover photo? That\u2019s very weird tbh. Why not a picture of YOURSELF and your husband? Even if you were not doing it to spite her it sure comes across that way.", "YTA And for anyone who is saying this isn't petty needs to look at OPs reasoning. OP felt it needed to be highlighted to show what a piece of crap his mom is and hers was a saint. Go look at the comments. I was all for NTA until I saw that. MIL hasn't said diddly squat about being excluded from her son's wedding until that post. I get that it has been difficult and they both need some grief therapy. But it's not on you to publicly shame her.", "She needs help dealing with grief so she can re-center herself.  \n\nI can see where that photo would be hurtful, though.  You're NTA but it would be a kindness maybe not to rub her face in what she missed out on.", "ESH.\n\nYou didn't put up a picture of you and husband, but your husband and your mom, who was clearly standing in for you MIL?  Them dancing was the most special part of your wedding, um, WTF?  That's... quite weird and can almost only be interpreted as a dig at your MIL.\n\nThat said, this lady needs a ton of therapy.  Thank goodness she did not go to your wedding, I can't imagine the scene she would have made.  I don't think things are quite at the point of no contact, but she is clearly unhinged and there need to be very firm boundaries moving forward.  Sounds like your husband will enforce those boundaries, that's a very good thing.\n\nYour MIL need therapy and you need some introspection.", "YTA. I get that you want to defend your husband, but you've crossed the line from defendor to attacker with this photo. You can stand up for your husband when in person with her and set form boundaries when she does something wrong, but for you to attack her when in this specific instance she respected your boundaries? Extreme asshole move there.", "YTA. The backstory doesn\u2019t justify the obvious vindictiveness.", "YTA for the cover photo.\n\nYes, your MIL needs therapy. Yes, I understand why you\u2019re frustrated with her behavior.\n\nDoes not change the fact that you\u2019re being inconsiderate by choosing that photo as the cover photo.", "Your future MIL needs therapy! How can two college educated people not realize she needs one.", "You are being a jerk and don\u2019t know it\u2026 and probably little pissed off, rightly so, for you and your husband that she has let her grief miss special moments.  Take the photo off FB\u2026the women has some major  grief and I am sorry,  that photo is just more grief on top of grief because she didn\u2019t have the ability  to control her emotions she now has probably deep regret and grief of that lost moment.   What you and your husband should be doing is helping her face the death of  husband and daughter so she can LIVE again.  Find a freaking grief support group and take her..go with her.   Grief is an emotion that can alter your thinking, change the way you view the world around you.  She is lost it in it and she needs professional help.  She is drowning and needs help.", "YTA.", "YTA. It's salt in the wound and you enjoy it.", "YTA. She does need to get some therapy, but damn. How insensitive can you be. Like twisting the knife.", "NTA  and she isn't either. She's drowning and she wants to take everyone down with her. So therapy as you know is what she needs but you're going to have to do the legwork here. You're going to have to find the doctor, make the appointments, go to them with her. She isn't going to do any of that on her own. At no point is she going to make the correlation that is what she needs. And by you I mean you and your husband.  Therapy when done well doesn't hurt and maybe you both can start the ball rolling to get her on board.  And that is the ultimatum, she has to receive help or go no contact. In the end your mental health is more important. Sorry this is a really sucky situation. But you can't keep doing this cycle of her manipulating you both to enable her. Unfortunately people that need therapy are usually way too scared or overwhelmed to do it.", "Yta", "Yta. I was leaning towards esh but your answers push me to the ah vote. Why do you need a picture of two other people for your profile pic? It's an odd choice and even odder that you want to die on this hill.", "Dude just change the photo. U have to pick and choose your battles. She was already left out of the wedding, and u said they have an unhealthy relationship now. Why make it worse and add salt to the wound. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I would try and make it easier for my husband if I could. I get it's hard being the bigger person. This, though, can be avoided.", "Softly YTA, all that picture does is set her off every time she stalks your page. Yes, she\u2019s crazy, crosses boundaries and needs grief therapy, and I understand you are indeed fed up. Still, it would be a kindness to take it down and not to remind her of what she has lost. A picture of you and your husband dancing would be a better choice, as opposed to a reminder that she\u2019s so crazy, she couldn\u2019t even manage to go to her only remaining child\u2019s wedding.  It\u2019s just a sad situation,  and I feel sorry for all of you.", "YTA - She is aware of being out of line, and not wanting too make a scene.  MIL cooperated with your request not to come.  It is very insensitive of you to post the ONE picture that was her part of that very important day.  Mom needs help, but you need to do better.", "I don't know if it makes you AH or not, but definitely could have been a little bit more sensitive. Based on the history, you should have known she was going to react this way.", "The picture really isn't what it's about. She's grieving. The idea that she's uninvited to her only living child's wedding doesn't help. Counseling is a great idea for her. But both you and Joe need to know that it takes time. Please don't help drive a wedge between the relationship with her. She is lonely, definitely suffering from depression. Insist she seeks professional medical help. Be kind. Try to include her in your life. Think about throwing an anniversary party where she can get a photo of her and Joe dancing.", "YTA for posting the pic. Of ALLLL the pics from your wedding, you made that one a cover photo. That's just salt in the wound. \n\nI am side eyeing all of your comments on your MIL. I think you are trying to drive a wedge between your husband and his mom. And you are pretty awful for not taking the photo down.", "She needs therapy and is over-stepping and it seems you understand that this is her grief causing her to act in such a manner. Her agreeing to stay home had to hurt her, even if she seemed to know it was best\u2026 tbh I\u2019d take that picture down from such a prominent place because it is a thing she missed out on and maybe didn\u2019t even occur to her at the time she agreed not to attend.\n\nIf someone tell you they are hurting, and you can help fix it with very minimal effort on your part: do so. This is a FB cover photo, and kind of outside of the norm to use one of your Mom and husband anyway. I can see why it feels especially pointed to your MiL.", "YTA. Especially after reading your comments.", "I had your back until the Facebook photo. She\u2019s already suffering, albeit while refusing to get help, and she respected your wishes to stay out of the wedding. There would\u2019ve been a thousand photos for you to choose and more appropriately you and your dad. But you chose to flaunt to the world how YOUR mom had to be the adult to save your husband embarrassment. \nSo YTA only because of the picture. You want to make her feel worse.", "Slight YTA.  You could have put up ANY picture from the wedding.  You decided to go with the one of your husband dancing with YOUR mom knowing that HIS mom wasn't there and was hurting.  And knowing that she would definitely see it on social media.  You had to have known on some level that this was a shot.  Any other picture.  Why wasn't it a picture of you and your husband?  Why?  \n\nYou even accepted the fact that people grieve in their own way.  It's only been 3 years since the passing of her daughter.  How long do you think you would grieve if anything happened to your husband?  Change the picture.", "YTA - regardless of how she would\u2019ve acted, she missed out on her son\u2019s wedding and presumably the only chance to see one of her children get married. She missed out on a mother and son dance. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having that photo, but using it as a profile pic or cover photo is insensitive. Yes it\u2019s her actions that made you ask her not to come, but she respected your wishes and you put it up a reminder that she was asked not to be there on your Facebook page. \n\nWhy does your cover photo HAVE to be that picture?", "I can\u2019t get over the fact that your MIL lost her husband and daughter and then her only remaining child disinvited her to their wedding. That is insane to me.", "NTA. But take the photo down. She seems unhinged and needs therapy, but there isn't any reason to have that photo up.", "NAH. I can understand why you made the decisions you made. I can also understand how that photo would be really hurtful to your MIL. She had two horrible losses in such a short time. The whole thing is terribly tragic and I hope she gets some help.", "Having lost my oldest daughter 27 years ago I can understand your MIL's grief.  It is a devastating and earth shattering loss.  She barely had time to get used to her husband's death when she then lost her daughter too.  You are right we all handle it differently, and unfortunately your MIL is not dealing with it well.  I think at this point your husband needs to have a one on one with his mother and try to get her into therapy.  She is miserable, there is no denying that, and unfortunately it's not manifesting in a productive way by anyone's stretch of the imagination.  I think he needs to make it clear that she needs to get some therapy or he will not be able to spend time with her due to her destructive behavior.  He needs to make it clear he loves her and he wants her in his life, but that in order for that to happen she needs to get help to learn how to cope with her loses.  Try to continue to have some compassion for her.  She has lost so much and 2 huge losses like that within a few years is just hard to cope with.  You don't get over those losses.  They are with you for the rest of your life, so you have to learn to deal with it.  I hope she will try therapy so she has a safe place to talk about what she has lost and can learn to direct her grief in a more productive way.", "YTA. But I say that with some compassion for you. Just take the picture down. Someone else had a great idea about using it as a bargaining chip for her to go into therapy. \n\nYou picked the ONE photo that is indeed a reminder of what she missed. I can\u2019t help but wonder if you did it intentionally, as you are (understandably) frustrated with her more extreme behavior. \n\n**Of all the photos from your wedding, did you really have to post THAT one as the largest photo on your profile page?!!**\n\nCome on OP\u2026that feels quite passive aggressive. I\u2019m not sure you are trying as hard as you say to empathize with her grief. \n\nI definitely agree that her behavior has crossed a line into unhinged territory. I agree it was best she did not attend the wedding. \n\nJust please do not rub it in her face.", "I'm not going to give you a verdict. But think of it from her POV (much as it is tinged and distorted by grief): she lost her spouse, then one of her children. Now you're putting up a picture for everyone who knows you both to see that she is kind of losing her last remaining child to other people. \n\nIs it rational? *No*. Is your reaction to her complaint also kind and rational, however? *Also no*. \n\nHer relationship with her son has clearly been damaged by her unresolved grief, for which she has yet to get help. That's on her. But fueling fears that it's becoming an irreparable breach, by highlighting a moment where her grief prevented her from being there for her son? **That's on you.**", "YTA; It seems like she's been on your nerves and now you're being super unsensitive about your FB pic.", "The issue is your Facebook cover.  No need to put this out in her face.  Just take down the photo.", "YTA she\u2019s mentally ill and needs help.", "YTA. I agree that she does not sound pleasant to be around, her behavior is explainable but not excusable. That said I think most anyone could see why it\u2019d be upsetting to see a photo highlighted where you are being replaced by another mother at your only living child\u2019s wedding, which you were too mentally unwell to go to. That photo would be a stinging reminder of that. The kind thing to do is to take the photo down, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s many other photos from that day that bring you joy and you can always have those pics elsewhere. \n\nJust because she makes your life difficult doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still be an asshole.", "Your MIL needs therapy, I'm sorry for het that she has had to go through so much loss. I'm sorry for you that you have this to deal with. However, YTA for using that profile picture and keeping it up after she told you it is hurtful. Very insensitive, you should change it.", "I feel bad for her", "NTA but in pursuit of peace (meaning silence) I\u2019d just change the picture. Or block her on FB, frankly. Either way would probably make life quietly.", "Ah fuck cmon dude. That is just dumb. Is she a trainwreck ya of course but why add fuel to the fire. Have it framed and in the house if you like it that much. It does NOT need to be your profile picture for christ sakes.", "YTA but for only one reason - and I hadn't thought this judgment until the very end.  You obviously have more than one picture from your wedding.  It's not going to hurt you to put up a picture other than joe and your mom.  TBH, i think that was done out of spite, at least to some degree.  I was completely with you until that point.", "YTA because you could have chosen many different pictures and you\u2019re rubbing it in, knowing ahead of time there wouldn\u2019t be a good reaction on her part. Granted she\u2019s a handful yet this is selfish on your part.", "You weren't the asshole up until the facebook picture part. Not inviting her to the wedding because you were worried she would cause a scene was fine, but putting a picture of her son dancing with your mom when you know she wished that could be her is cruel.", "My husband's sister died in a car crash at age 29. His parents were understandably devastated. It was horrendous. After about a year we gave them a book on the grieving process to help them. They took it as us wanting them to \"get over it .\"\n\nEdit: I can't say I would have handled it any better--probably worse--but I hope someone would reach out to pull me out of the quicksand.", "YNTA but I would take it down. I would also pay for some therapy for your MIL.", ">I recently changed my FB cover photo to a picture of Joe and my mom dancing and laughing.\n\n\nUgh, you're not the asshole for this but why...", "I do find it a little odd that you chose a picture of your husband and your mother, not the two of you, for your cover photo.. seems a little jabby. And I too have an oddball MIL (to put it VERY nicely) who constantly steps out of line and abuses her relationship with my husband. She actually yelled at me for over an hour the morning of my wedding, so I hear you loud and clear. It does seem like an intentional jab though to make the photo of your mom and him so significant. Post it for sure but not as your cover photo.", "ESH. I was also on board until that last bit. She needs to stop making her issues everyone else\u2019s problems. She also needs to figure out how to make the best of the time she has left with the people that are still living.\n\nBut I feel like that posting that picture was kind of nasty. There\u2019s no way you couldn\u2019t have known it would upset her.", ">We try to be especially kind to her on mother's day, but she spends HOURS at the cemetery and gets very irate if we leave before she's ready to.\n\nYTA for this. You also an asshole for a bunch of other reasons, but this is where you first start to stink of it. Honestly, it feels like you find your mil too much work with her grief and are pushing her out of your husband's life for your own ease.", "Esh", "Reading your comments: NTA. I think maybe you should add some edits and context to your main post because your mother in law hasn't treated your husband as a son for years. I lost my brother years ago and while your MIL exhibits some of the behavior my mother did (and still does) my mother never refused to celebrate birthdays or holidays. My mother didn't abandon her remaining children the way it seems your MIL did.\n\nShe's missed his birthdays, graduation, holidays, for at least 3 years, was she ever there for him while HE was grieving his sister and father? Your husband's grief matters too, even if he's not grieving the way your MIL clearly wants him to grieve.", "In spite of MIL's behavior, I gotta go with YTA on this one. Of all the pictures you could have put up, you pick THAT one?? Not only was going to upset her, it would also probably raise questions as to why she wasn't the one in the picture. That's kinda mean to be honest.", "Yeah that\u2019s so weird to me", "Well said", "Not at all. She has looked through all of the wedding photos including this one and has said nothing other than \u201cliking\u201d every picture in the album. It only became an issue when I made it my cover photo.", "I have to agree, I really thought NTA at first but the more I read the more I have to agree, there's a line of holding yourself from going crazy (not inviting her to the wedding) and then just trying to write her off from the family altogether (choosing THIS photo). \n\nThis isn't excusing all the insane behaviours she's been doing, it's a real handful, but she's not a lost cause. You should be helping send her into therapy now that your weddings over, and you're done being the star. It's time to help your husband by helping his mom get better. \n\nThe first step is NOT being inconsiderate.\n\n\nYTA now", "i'm happy someone else feels the same way about it. i almost want to guess that her annoyance with it started with the very legitimate unhinged behavior of mil but i think it's one of those instances where the bias is taking over and cant see anything other than what your mind has up. if that makes sense?", "She also neglected her only living child by choosing not to attend his graduation and ignoring his birthdays. There's a good chance she would have made the wedding about his sister when it was about him and OP.", "Seriously, all these little armchair therapists, wtf.\n\nI am speaking from personal experience (long-time therapy goer), here : If you have a mental illness, or are experiencing grief - YOUR TRIGGERS are YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. YOUR BOUNDARIES are YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. You do not, under any circumstances, get to dictate or otherwise alter another persons behavior to suit your precious feelings. YOU have the problem. You don't get to put that problem on other people.\n\nSolidly NTA, imo. MIL needs professional counseling, and the onus is on her to take that step. Forcing people to walk on eggshells around you, or otherwise disengage from their own lives for your own sake is selfish as fuck. It's also won't fix a damn thing. MIL is  digging herself into an even worse place via self-alienation.", ">Is MIL sitting around with OP's FB page open all day and letting herself be grieved by it\n\nThat's the impression I got. Losing a child hits hard for sure but the moment I got to the graduation story, i knew this woman is just dragging it out.", "Yes. But OP had to know that MIL would react poorly. She could have very easily put up a picture of herself and dad dancing, or of herself and her spouse in wedding attire. \n\nWhen you know someone is unhinged and creates drama at the drop of a hat, you do not feed those inclinations. \n\nJust because MIL is kind of a giant AH doesn't mean OP is completely blameless in this particular instance.", "Seems like she's as good as deceased to her son. She's missed every important event of his. She could have pulled herself together for those events, but has let her grief define her.", "Thats so sad. So sad she had to miss her son's wedding too. I feel bad for her but she definitely needs professional help. This is beyond you and your son now", "Thus my comment being \u201cI feel like\u2026\u201d", "It sounds like it\u2019s a cover photo, not a profile photo", "I don't see the problem. She didn't really about her son. Why would the bride be considerate? Why would she constantly try to be the reasonable one? Is just Facebook... unhinged or not", "I don\u2019t think so. The sister died 3 years ago", "Not even a little.", "For the record OP I would change the photo, not because it\u2019s wrong to love the picture but just for the sake of your own sanity. I think you have chosen this hill to die on because you\u2019ve reached the end of your rope but I would say you\u2019re kind of putting a bandaid on a bullet wound by making this your last stand. \n\nYou and your husband need to have a sit down long conversation about what the future with his mother looks like. He\u2019s been through immense loss and I imagine him getting to the place emotionally where he feels like his mother can\u2019t attend his wedding was torturous. You all need a long term plan for how he balances honoring those he\u2019s lost and recognizing that he deserves his own identity and life outside the grief. Which should include what role his mother plays in his life and how boundaries are set and maintained. It would likely be worthwhile to warn her friends or any other family she has because I am sure your husband struggles with the guilt of being her last living blood. His guilt and love for her don\u2019t mean he deserves to put up with an indefinite number of years of abuse though", "I promise I\u2019m not asking this as a gotcha, or in bad faith, but I\u2019m genuinely curious why OP should take down the picture because it\u2019s \u201csuch a small thing\u201d she can do for her MIL when her MiL won\u2019t even do the bare minimum of showing up for her son? \n\nI\u2019m all for helping out people when they\u2019re down and doing what I can to mitigate their struggle, but when it comes to a person who constantly puts themselves and their wants over everyone around them I think it\u2019s okay to eventually choose yourself and your wants, regardless of how it makes them feel.\n\nAlso also, a small thing MIL could do for her pain is to not go lurking on OPs profile to see her background picture.", "Say it louder for people in the back! THERAPISTS ARE NOT MAGICIANS!!", "Is she mad at them for moving? That's what it seems like if she's mad at Joe for seeing them, not that she has any right to be upset. Maybe she feels like she's losing everyone? Again, not an excuse. As others have said, therapy might be beneficial. Unfortunately, people like her, don't want to admit anything is wrong or don't believe in therapy. You should both sit her down, tell her how she makes you feel and what you think. Tell her if she doesn't stop, you'll have to distance yourselves from her until she does.", "Because it seems EVERYTHING upsets MIL.", "I don\u2019t know. I think OP has done a decent job of not giving into her MILs tantrums to the point that MIL agreed to not go to her only son\u2019s wedding which is a pretty big deal.\n\nI think OP can lighten up on this one issue and still maintain a proper set of boundaries with her MIL. Taking down the picture isn\u2019t the end of the world and the woman did lose her husband and daughter\u2026and the opportunity to enjoy her remaining son\u2019s wedding due to being grief stricken. Like, can OP show some type empathy?", "MIL actively chose not to go to her only son's college graduation, so I think assuming she was showing up to the wedding at all even if she WAS invited is a bit of a stretch. She has chosen grief over her living child multiple times with her actions. I've encountered people like her. They can be insufferable, and she would have most definitely made the wedding a funeral 2.0! My best friend passed away in her early 20s, and her mom had lost her husband 6 years prior. Every single thing with any of her living children was turned into a spectacle in \"honor\" of the one who passed away.", "It\u2019s not her profile pic, it\u2019s her cover photo. It\u2019s not weird to not be in your cover photo.", "Dying of a broken heart is a thing. For people that have spent their lives together, statistics show that when one dies, there's a good chance the other will pass within or around a year later (look at Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth). Debbie Reynolds died just a day after her daughter Carrie Fischer died. The heart just kind of gives up. Even though my grandparents were divorced, my grandma still died almost to the day a year after my grandpa. It kinda makes sense in a way, it's hard to keep fighting to live when the love of your life is gone.", "Nope....it sure shouldn't. I can imagine how touched/proud OP was that her mother was so concerned about hubby & what he was feeling...and hubby deserved that moment/memory ~ what better way than with his other mother?? I would post it too! It's her memory & probably the most cherished moment of her wedding!"]}
