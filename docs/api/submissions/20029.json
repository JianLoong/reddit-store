You need to seriously start watching whether or not your relationship is 100% - 100% instead of 100% - 20%. ( I don't believe in 50-50, it should be 100-100). If its lopsided, either something needs to change, or move on. You deserve to feel important.", "NAH.  You and she need to have a discussion about expectations and how certain actions make you feel.\n\nI suspect we're dealing with different Love Languages here which are creating different expectations.", "No, you're not the asshole, but unless you've voiced your concerns about her not reciprocating your gifts then she isn't the asshole either. I would suggest talking to her, and letting her know that giving/getting gifts is part of your love language, and you would appreciate it if she put more thought into gifts for you on special occasions.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nYou sound like her work colleague Secret Santa (and not even a colleague she likes or knows particularly well.) So you get a set of three bathbombs, or some generic chocolates, or a cheap giftcard. Little effort, little cost.\n\nYou don't have to blow your budget to do something thoughtful. If you like games she could treat you to a day out at an arcade. If you like sports she could get you some merch, or tickets to a game. If you like activity she could take you out on a nice hike, with a pre-packed picnic. Even just a day in with the curtains closed, binge-watching your favourite movies with bottomless popcorn!\n\nIt's not the fact that she didn't pay that bothers me, so much as the fact that she doesn't seem to ***care***.

Serious lack of effort on her behalf and I'd be feeling pissed off about it too. Even if I can't afford to get my man out to a fancy restaurant, because babysitting fees, I'll ALWAYS cook a really lavish meal and desert from scratch and make a fuss of him. After 2 years if she's not putting in the same effort level you are to express appreciation for having you in her life then I'd be having a SERIOUS talk.

Both of you. \n\nThere's a big cultural gap between the people who don't do anything much about birthdays beyond childhood, and those for whom their birthday remains important to them throughout their life (and other people's birthdays whom they care about, too). \n\nYou're clearly in the second category. Your girlfriend may be in the first. If that's true, then you're going to need to explicitly *tell* her that you would like for her to take the initiative to do something special for you on your birthday. And preferably, give her a few examples, so she understands what \"something special\" means to you. \n\nIf she usually makes a fuss over other people's birthdays and just not yours, then yes, you might have reason to be upset. If she doesn't make a fuss over anybody's, then all you probably need to do is use your words and tell her what you want.", "I\u2019m not going to lie. These questions utterly frustrate me because they\u2019re ultimately just about communication. If you feel disappointed or unappreciated, then tell her.
