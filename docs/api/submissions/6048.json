I want to thank you for all your hard work & dedication. To show my appreciation, I would like to invite everyone out to a Christmas gathering.\u201d\n\nThe email continues to propose a date, time, and location. Anyway, I attended the dinner and had a wonderful time. It was at a brewpub, so everyone ordered 2-3 drinks a person plus dinner. We stayed for approx. 2 hours and I was the first one to leave. \n\nI got up out of my seat and said something along the lines of \u201cokay everyone, I need to get going. Thank you [managers name] for taking us out! I hope everyone has a wonderful Christmas!\u201d \nThen my manager says \u201cwait, [my name] did you pay for your tab?\u201d And I looked at him awkwardly and said \u201cno, sorry\u201d then a few seconds passed and I said \u201cI apologize, I\u2019ll go find the waiter and request my tab.\u201d \nThen after another awkward couple seconds he says \u201cno worries! I\u2019ll pay for everyone.\u201d I asked if he was sure, and he said yes. Then I thanked everyone again and left.\n\nComing back to work after Christmas break, some of my colleagues said I was being rude and I shouldn\u2019t expect him to pay for everything. \n\nFrom my viewpoint, I read the email as if our manager was paying since he said he wanted \u201cto show his appreciation\u201d and \u201cthank you all for your hard work.\u201d Also, it\u2019s important to note that all managers at my work received a $15,000 Christmas bonus. All other staff received a $10 Starbucks gift card.\n\nAITA? Should I apologize to everyone for being rude? \n\n\nThank you!\n\nEDIT: To clarify a few points...\n\n1) I don't think my manager was joking. He seemed genuinely serious.\n\n2) Some have mentioned that the company typically pays for social meals such as this. Our company does NOT do this, and the tab was entirely on our manager (this is why I mentioned the Christmas bonus). Also, there was no clarification to pay only for my drinks (as some stated, their company will pay for dinner but limited drinks), he simply said \"... did you pay for your tab?\" which I assume is everything. \n\n3) I talked with more of my coworkers that attended the dinner since I made this post, and several of them stated that they expected the same thing (that he was paying) and they were happy they weren't put into that awkward situation. For the coworkers who thought I was being rude, it was because I assumed beforehand and that we can afford it (I work with a team of scientists/engineers so we make decent money).

It sounds like theres a huge difference in OPs wages vs the managers, so 1. It's likely less of a burden for manager to pay, and 2.

I'm saying that in a situation where the wage disparity is that significant, its particularly inconsiderate of the manager to invite everyone out and make it sound like a gift if they're not intending to pay. Its inconsiderate either way, but it just adds insult to injury.", "I'm not saying it should be expected for the manager to treat employees to dinner. I'm saying the manager would know that they got a 15k bonus vs the employees getting $10 gift card, as well as whatever the difference in their wages is. So in the scenerio where the manager is inviting them out as a show of appreciation and making it sound like a gift, it's especially shitty of them to not specify that they're not paying because the manager should know that the employees may not have much money. \n\nAs an example, if the manager was inviting colleagues who also got 15k bonuses or had similar wages, and then did the same thing, it would still be inconsiderate, and they might still be pissed. But they would likely be more able to pay their own bill.

And I'm clearly not alone on that.", "This is was what I was going for when I mentioned the Christmas bonus.", "Yeah, and you don't even need to get to that question. The bottom line is that the manager issued an invitation. That means he pays. I don't care if the manager is a multi\u2013millionaire. All that matters is that the manager issued the invitation and, therefore should pay. I'm really not interested in continuing to argue this point with you: again, the manager's compensation means nothing in this calculus.", "They're an AH with or without the bonus being a factor. That's my point.\n\nIf they'd just decided to get Christmas drinks without the poorly worded invite, no one (apart from a few hopefuls) would expect the boss to cover it. Would it be nice, sure. Would they be an AH for not doing it? No.\n\nThat's what I mean by the money not being relevant. It's the wording and the expectations that gave that did it.", "I think it's a completely valid point.", "I respectfully disagree and I've explained why. You haven't really addressed an argument against my reasoning, you just seem insistent that I should agree with you. \n\nNo big deal. Though I can't help but wonder why you're taking such an issue with this, maybe something to think about. Take care.", "Ok I get that, maybe I misunderstood what you meant. \n\nI agree they're the AH either way, and I was never trying to argue that the implications within the wording of the invite wasn't the main factor. I was just trying to say that I think its understandable if the bonus aspect made it feel like they were even more of an AH. But totally AH either way without that. In the context of determining whether they're the AH or not it's not a deciding factor because they are either way. \n\nThanks for explaining your viewpoint to me, I get what you mean and appreciate you being respectful about it.", "Yeah, I can continue to explain things to you, but I can't understand them for you. Again, the only thing that matters is that the manager issued the invitation. That means he must pay. Period. End of story. End of case.
