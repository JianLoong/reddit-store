Thank you [managers name] for taking us out! I hope everyone has a wonderful Christmas!\u201d \nThen my manager says \u201cwait, [my name] did you pay for your tab?\u201d And I looked at him awkwardly and said \u201cno, sorry\u201d then a few seconds passed and I said \u201cI apologize, I\u2019ll go find the waiter and request my tab.\u201d \nThen after another awkward couple seconds he says \u201cno worries! I\u2019ll pay for everyone.\u201d I asked if he was sure, and he said yes. Then I thanked everyone again and left.\n\nComing back to work after Christmas break, some of my colleagues said I was being rude and I shouldn\u2019t expect him to pay for everything. \n\nFrom my viewpoint, I read the email as if our manager was paying since he said he wanted \u201cto show his appreciation\u201d and \u201cthank you all for your hard work.\u201d Also, it\u2019s important to note that all managers at my work received a $15,000 Christmas bonus.

It would be different if y\u2019all were in the break room and he suggested it as like, a group hangout, but he sent an email with a location, date, and time already picked out. A $15,000 Christmas bonus??? he should be doing a lot more than just one night out imo!!  You\u2019re NTA, and tbh the only Assholes are the coworkers saying shit to you.", "NTA. He was inviting you to dinner to show his appreciation.. how is he doing that if you have to pay for yourself? Is the show of appreciation you being offered the honour to dine with him? I would have been pissed.", "NTA. \"To show my appreciation...\" are the words that someone who intended to treat everyone should use.", "NTA. Person inviting pays unless it's clearly stated otherwise in the invitation.", "NTA - That was definitely the subtext of the email. I would have assumed the manager was paying as well.", "INFO: are you sure he wasn't just asking for you to pay for your drink tab? At my company we aren't allowed to expense alcohol.", "NTA\n\nI would have absolutely assumed the company was paying given the language of the invite.

Finds a new job. How can a manager say \"let me show you my appreciation\" and then call you out. It is borderline harassment and report it to HR. Any company that's giving it's managers a 15k bonus and employees only 10 bucks, is not worth working for.", "NTA most people would have made the same assumption, and its odd your colleagues didn't based off this, and that nothing was said when the orders went in\n\n>I want to thank you for all your hard work & dedication. To show my appreciation, I would like to invite everyone out to a Christmas gathering", "NTA - it makes sense you'd assume the employer was picking up the tab. However, I believe the general rule when invited out is that the meal is covered, but alcoholic beverages are not. Mostly because it's liability for the employer to offer/supply alcohol to an employee even during off hours, especially when it's an office-wide celebration.", "NTA. He invited everyone out, which means he's paying. \n\nThat he received a $15k Christmas bonus, however, is completely irrelevant.", "NTA. I think if he wanted people to pay for themselves, he should have clarified that on the invite. \n\nMost companies have a T&E budget that covers Christmas parties.", "NAH\n\nI think the situation comes down to understanding what \"tab\" means.  To me it implies the drinks but to others it means the meal plus drinks.\n\nIt should be made clear on any further invites what will be covered ie To show my appreciation I would like to invite everyone out to a Christmas gathering and I will cover the cost of the meal plus one drink.  Any extra drinks will be down to the people ordering them.", "NTA Whenever any of my bosses invited us to an event where we were to cover our expenses, this was specifically said.

Generally if it's to be paid for by the company that's clear upfront.", "NAH. No, you shouldn't apologize to everyone. You might consider apologizing to your manager for assuming he was paying for everyone. It would have been pretty simple for you to ask him instead of assuming. Or to wait for someone else to leave first if you felt awkward about raising the topic.", "NAH, just poor communication.", "YTA - While it should have been made more clear what makes you the AH and expected the managers to pay for it was \"all managers at my work received a $15,000 Christmas bonus.

And I don\u2019t think it was a joke\u2026 he sounded serious.", "To Be fair, I would assume food, but I wouldn't assume drinks unless it was discussed, After all, some people will pound $15 cocktails.... Generally when I've gone to dinner with a manager we were told up front they would cover food and 1 or 2 drinks.\n\nNTA OP", "I think in this case it totally is relevant. It sounds like theres a huge difference in OPs wages vs the managers, so 1. It's likely less of a burden for manager to pay, and 2. If not planning to pay, the manager should have understood the importance of making it clear that they wouldnt be paying, so the employees didnt end up with an expected bill they may not be able to afford.", "The assholes are the coworkers who are guilting OP for this perfectly normal, if not somewhat awkward, situation", "Yeah ... my assumption would be that it was just a really awkward joke.....?\n\n\"I'm inviting you out to dinner\" ABSOLUTELY means \"I'm paying\" (especially in this context as a manager). And I realize he sounded serious, but the fact that he went straight from \"did you pay your tab\" to \"I'll pay for everyone\" does make it seem like he always intended to pay for everyone. \n\nNAH", "Well either way, he\u2019s a total jerk. If I ever took my employees to a holiday lunch or any lunch, breakfast, and food at all, I always paid for it. Sometimes with my own money and sometimes with company money", "Agreed", "I agree with this. OP is NTA but also it should have been clear what was being paid or not. My office will pay for the meal and 2 (alcoholic; soda/tea/coffee is free no matter how many) drinks if it's a work function, but anything after that is on your own tab.", "So the richest person in any group pays? I don't think so. The only thing that's relevant is that the manager issued the invitation and, therefore, should pay.", "It's not relevant really.\n\nI used to work for a bar chain where the manager got a bonus based on performance for their site. I worked at a few different sites and only *one* manager treated the team when they got theirs. It was nice of them to do so but not expected.", "Truer words have never been spoken. To tell you the truth, OP ought to be looking for a new job. When she quits, she should tell her bosses boss that this incident was the cause.", "Very good point. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc I was focused more on OP and manager, but you\u2019re absolutely right about the others.", "I've always had the manager that intends on paying say so before anyone orders.", "I'm not saying the richest person in any group pays automatically. I'm saying that in a situation where the wage disparity is that significant, its particularly inconsiderate of the manager to invite everyone out and make it sound like a gift if they're not intending to pay. Its inconsiderate either way, but it just adds insult to injury.", "I'm not saying it should be expected for the manager to treat employees to dinner. I'm saying the manager would know that they got a 15k bonus vs the employees getting $10 gift card, as well as whatever the difference in their wages is. So in the scenerio where the manager is inviting them out as a show of appreciation and making it sound like a gift, it's especially shitty of them to not specify that they're not paying because the manager should know that the employees may not have much money. \n\nAs an example, if the manager was inviting colleagues who also got 15k bonuses or had similar wages, and then did the same thing, it would still be inconsiderate, and they might still be pissed. But they would likely be more able to pay their own bill. And they wouldnt be sitting there also reminded of the wage/bonus disparity, because it doesnt exist in this scenerio. \n\nAll I'm saying is the whole bonus thing makes this a little bit grosser. And I'm clearly not alone on that.", "This is was what I was going for when I mentioned the Christmas bonus.", "Yeah, and you don't even need to get to that question. The bottom line is that the manager issued an invitation. That means he pays. I don't care if the manager is a multi\u2013millionaire. All that matters is that the manager issued the invitation and, therefore should pay. I'm really not interested in continuing to argue this point with you: again, the manager's compensation means nothing in this calculus.", "They're an AH with or without the bonus being a factor. That's my point.\n\nIf they'd just decided to get Christmas drinks without the poorly worded invite, no one (apart from a few hopefuls) would expect the boss to cover it. Would it be nice, sure. Would they be an AH for not doing it? No.\n\nThat's what I mean by the money not being relevant. It's the wording and the expectations that gave that did it.", "I think it's a completely valid point.", "I respectfully disagree and I've explained why. You haven't really addressed an argument against my reasoning, you just seem insistent that I should agree with you. \n\nNo big deal. Though I can't help but wonder why you're taking such an issue with this, maybe something to think about. Take care.", "Ok I get that, maybe I misunderstood what you meant. \n\nI agree they're the AH either way, and I was never trying to argue that the implications within the wording of the invite wasn't the main factor. I was just trying to say that I think its understandable if the bonus aspect made it feel like they were even more of an AH. But totally AH either way without that. In the context of determining whether they're the AH or not it's not a deciding factor because they are either way. \n\nThanks for explaining your viewpoint to me, I get what you mean and appreciate you being respectful about it.", "Yeah, I can continue to explain things to you, but I can't understand them for you. Again, the only thing that matters is that the manager issued the invitation. That means he must pay. Period. End of story. End of case. I don't know why you are insisting that something else matters here, or why you continue to attempt to engage when I've made it clear that it's not appreciated.", "Dude you're coming off as such an ass lol", "You sound insufferable.", "Lol you're continuing to reply. You seem to be getting really mad that I don't agree with you. I don't agree with you though. I'm probably not going to unless you actually give me a good reason to. That's okay, I don't have to, people have different opinions. I can't make you understand mine either. This whole subreddit is about different opinions. \n\nEnjoy your bonus if you got one this year, dude. \ud83d\ude09", "Oh, well", "You don't even know me! \n\n:-)", "LOL. I'm not the one who jumped onto someone else's thread to start pontificating!", "It wasn't my intention to come across that way, apologies if I did. Take care."]}
