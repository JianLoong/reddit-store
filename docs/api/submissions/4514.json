I asked the kid what does he want to be when he grows up, because that's something you ask kids I guess. I am not good with kids really. I am not disliking them or some kind of cultist like the wingbags in r/childfree, I just don't really know how to interact with them. So I figure, I'll ask this kid what he wants to be when he grows up and pretend to think that is interesting and see what happens.\n\nSo I ask this kid, and he claims he wants to \"be a bean\" when he grows up. I'm like, what the fuck? (I didn't swear at him but I was thinking it.) So I ask him, what do you mean? A bean? And he's basically yeah, he wants to be a bean. Literally a bean. I ask my bro and he's like \"The kid likes beans.\" \n\nNow I'm all for imagination, but it seems this kid really believed he would somehow become a bean. I asked him what he'd do if he became a bean, and he said \"bean things\", whatever that means. I felt it was not realistic for him to go around thinking he can become a bean. I mean pretend time is fine and dandy, but to really think it? Very dangerous. \n\nSo I told him, look kid I have to tell you it is cool to like beans but it is just not possible for humans to turn into beans. You will never be a bean. This kid started to cry, which astonished me. I tried to say, hey maybe you can be a bean farmer or a bean chef or something (I know a bean chef isn't real but at least it is plausible to cook with beans) but he wasn't hearing it. I figured, well the bandaid was ripped off as needed and he'll get over it. \n\nWell I was astounded to find my bro and his wife (my SIL I suppose) were very furious at me. Not just annoyed, but actually angry. \"How dare I\", \"He's just a kid\", all kinds of stuff. They asked me to leave and my bro has been blowing up my phone demanding to apologize. \n\nNow look I felt bad the kid cried I never expected such a thing would happen, but I don't feel bad he knows the truth he can't become a bean. I believe in honesty, I don't think it is right to lie to a kid or let them believe false information. I think I was in the right to be truthful. But my bro and his wife are still very angry at me, and now I have other family members dissing on my ass too.
