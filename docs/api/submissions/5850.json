This was 2 years ago when Kelly was 2 and Jenna was 5. The girls still see each other (3-5 times a month)\nFor Christmas this year Jake had Jenna but on the 22nd he dropped her off at my place claiming that Jenna\u2019s mother was ill and he couldn\u2019t watch Jenna. I don\u2019t have contact with \u201cAmy\u201d Jenna\u2019s mother as Jake is always the one bringing Jenna here and he\u2019s never taken Kelly to Amy\u2019s. \nJenna has slept here before so that wasn\u2019t a hassle, but I wasn\u2019t sure when Jake would pick her up as my calls weren\u2019t going through to him. \nMy parents came over for Christmas and the day Jake dropped Jenna off I rang them and asked if they could pick up some presents for her because it was a surprise she was here. They didn\u2019t mind and got her age appropriate items (bracelet making kit, lol surprises and a matching sweater to Kelly) then they\u2019d also let my brother and sil know Jenna is here and they\u2019d gotten her several more gifts (nail polish, stickers, a fluffy hat) to make up for her mom being sick. I also managed to pick her up some squish mallows and chocolates as well as get her a stocking which I added mini gifts(hair clips, play dough cute pens)\nSo on Christmas she had a similar amount of gifts to my daughter and nephew and she seemed really happy. Then last night Jake stopped to get her and said she\u2019s fine to go home so we packed her toys and she took them with her.\nThen a few hours later I got a call from a random number. It was Amy, Jake gave her my number. And she started yelling saying that I took her daughter for Christmas and then I spoiled her. \nI tried to calm her down but she hung up and so I texted her that I was sorry but I didn\u2019t mean to take her and it wasn\u2019t my fault Jake dropped her on me. She called me again saying that I should stop lying and that Jake told her how I showed up to his with my daughter and presents trying to upstage the presents she\u2019d sent to him for Jenna. \nI told her that Jake left Jenna at my house, and I sent her the screenshots of me asking him when he\u2019d going to pick Jenna up etc. I told her I\u2019m sorry he lied to you but it\u2019s not my problem.\n\nI only think I could be an ah because I knew Amy Isn\u2019t well off financially but still wanted Jenna to have lots of gifts so she wouldn\u2019t think about not being with her family.", "created_utc": 1672231497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx8ouz/aita_for_giving_my_daughters_half_sister_a_lot_of/", "score": 222, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd be seeing a custody lawyer real quick. If your ex is willing to lie and drop off his other child with a person the parent doesn't know he'll do the same with your kid.

That\u2019s part of the reason we broke up- he never told me where he was going though he probably was seeing her", "Thank you for clarifying, that definitely changes things. It's a bit weird that you're daughter never goes with them though [unless thats a decision you made because you don't trust them]. But they get their alone time when Jenna comes over, you deserve a little alone time too! His daughter's should also both be able to see their father in his element. I'm sure Kelly wonders why she never gets to play at Jenna's house.", "NTA\n\nJake is playing both you and Amy. My guess: He was supposed to have Jenna for Christmas and give her presents both from him and Amy. For some reason he didn't feel like doing that (New woman he doesn't tell about his children? No motivation to watch Jenna/ have a tree/ do Christmas?) And instead of telling Amy he doesn't want to see Jenna on Christmas, which would make him look bad, he dumped her on you knowing full well, you would do everything to include her. But because he is an idiot, he didn't anticipate how it would play put after his booty call, panicked and just blamed it on you.", "You're NTA but you understand that Jake is literally ditching his child with you on his custody time to get out of parenting, right? Without his co-parent being aware?You have the woman's number, I think you start texting her every single time he leaves the child with you. \"Hey just so you know, Jake left Jenna with me. As always, happy to care for her, just wanted you to be aware of where your child is,\" or whatever. Personally I'd ask first if she wants that information, but if it happens on a holiday again, let her know as soon as the kid is with you regardless if she wants texts more generally. Just me, but I would also go a step further and suggest documentation in case she wants to alter her custody agreement? \"Hey would you like me to text you every time (ex) drops off Jenna here to make sure you know? If he leaves my daughter with you similarly, I'd love to know so that I could document it and get our custody agreement altered. If he's passing on Christmas with his child, that holiday should always not be his!\" or something.", "So your ex had his older daughter for xmas, didn't want her to interfere with his holiday plans, dumped her on you and then went MIA until after xmas? Then told his daughter's mum that the child was with him for xmas and you just randomly showed up with a bunch of gifts?\n\nYou are NTA, and you're a good person for fully including that wee girl in your family xmas. Your ex's ex is slightly TA in that yeah, she was lied to but she could have asked her daughter for clarification. Your ex though, he is a raging, diseased AH of epic proportions, and I hope his next shite is a hedgehog.", "NTA.   You treated her just like you would have wanted someone to treat your baby girl.  Cudos to you and your family for making that baby feel so welcome and loved.", "NTA. You sound like an absolute star and so do your family. \n\nWell done for sending the screen shots, clearly your AH ex fed her a pile of crap and now she\u2019s going to start seeing through his bullshit, which will work out better for everyone (except Jake). Maybe she\u2019ll wake up and you guys can arrange your daughters\u2019 relationship without the help of dickwad dad.", "NTA \n\nbut your ex is playing games that will cause problems between the siblings and you and the other mother. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would tread very carefully.", "Nta\nIt would go along way though to text Amy and tell her her daughter is amazing kid and that she is clearly a darn good mother.", "NTA, but your ex is a lying dillhole and needs to be called out. At least you exposed his lies... Kinda curious to know how that went. I'm betting he didn't want to have the kid at his place so he could bang someone and Amy getting sick was perfectly convenient timing.", "NTA, but learn yo use paragraphs.   Your post was so unnecessarily wordy it made my head spin.", "Amy can be forgiven because she was lied to. Their ex on the other hand is an absolute donkey's ass.", "Amy was still an AH for believing her ex's BS, not talking to her 7yr old to find out what really happened, and for going in immediately aggressive instead of talking to OP like a normal person.", "I think you do too much and ex knows exactly what he's doing.

How ill was she that she did not even talk to her kid over Xmas or know where she was and is now suddenly fine to harass you about presents? Or was she not ill at all and just thought her daughter was with dad? \nAnd the girl is now fully capable of telling her where she spent the last several days,  why has she not asked her all about it?

You've been awesome to Jenna.

What you did with the knowledge you had at the time was simply wonderful.", "An addict. \n\nOP, please don\u2019t let him take your daughter, until he comes clean about what he did. Where was he?", "Right, I'm so glad OP and her family stepped up for this child. \n\nAlso, any parent that gets mad for someone helping their child, even if it's just material things, can fk right off. I get she is sick and likely embarrassed she can't afford some things, but she should also be happy her child was looked after and thought of.", "This right here. Did Amy overreact? Maybe, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019d know for sure unless we knew what exactly Jake told her this time and has told her previously. And I would almost guarantee he\u2019s been telling Amy lies constantly about OP and both their daughters. That builds up. And just what we know he told her definitely warrants a reaction from Amy.\n\nAt any rate, we have three parents here. OP is the first\u2014and did a wonderful job welcoming an unexpected child into the home on Christmas. One (Jake) we now know is manipulative at best, and I suspect you\u2019re absolutely right about why Jenna is with OP so often. The last parent, Amy, is currently an unknown quantity, and my personal life philosophy is to give people a real chance before you write them off. Amy and OP could become very good allies if OP plays her cards right and if Amy is a decent parent and reasonable person.\n\nI\u2019d also say that this might be OP\u2019s sign to get her own custody/visitation arrangements buttoned up if they aren\u2019t already. It might be like my state where unmarried mothers have all the rights and unmarried fathers have no rights unless they go to court, in which case, don\u2019t rock the boat, but if OP is not already clear on her own rights and Jake\u2019s rights, it\u2019s time to get clear. Maybe not time to act, but definitely time to make sure she knows exactly who has what rights now and how that could change.", ">New woman he doesn't tell about his children?\n\nooooooooh, that sounds bang on to me. Or possibly a different baby mamma who has no idea their child has siblings.", "And then he gave Amy OP's phone number, so they could compare notes and figure out he was lying.... besides being an AH, this guy is not the brightest bulb in the bunch.", "Right?", "Amy's only response should have been \"thank you for being kind to my kid \" Anything else is AH territory", "NTA\n\nY'all know what. I think Jake was up to something the whole time Jenna was at OP's place. Me thinks a 3rd baby is on the way.", "NTA wow Jake is the WORST.  Dumping his other kid on you at Christmas, lying to her mother about it.  You are in a really tough spot, and what you did for Jenna was really kind.  I hope you and Amy are able to have a rational talk sometime and work this out, because unfortunately both of you had a kid with a terrible deadbeat of a dad.", "NTA.", "Jake is a prick.\n\nYou are amazing!

He is using you  to care for his kid b/c he doesn't want to admit to his other ex he isn't caring for her.\n\nYou should really figure out what is going on her, because whatever it is, it isn't good for either girl.", "NTA. Do not take Jenna anymore unless you hear from Amy herself, she also owes you an apology because she knows what kind of useless person your shared ex is. \nYou have her number now.

I'm sorry that your ex is such a piece of work. \nHowever, I think you need to be careful with how you deal with your ex and Jenna in the future.

You don't want to get dragged into more of your ex's schemes or drama.", "NTA and nor is Amy, the AH is your ex who lied to her and who left his child with you.", "NTA!! you did something kind. Jake must be lying about something.", "The asshole in this scenario is Jake, who dumps his daughter and then lies to her mother. \n\nYou did a kind thing. The other mother is being fed a line.
