This was 2 years ago when Kelly was 2 and Jenna was 5. The girls still see each other (3-5 times a month)\nFor Christmas this year Jake had Jenna but on the 22nd he dropped her off at my place claiming that Jenna\u2019s mother was ill and he couldn\u2019t watch Jenna. I don\u2019t have contact with \u201cAmy\u201d Jenna\u2019s mother as Jake is always the one bringing Jenna here and he\u2019s never taken Kelly to Amy\u2019s. \nJenna has slept here before so that wasn\u2019t a hassle, but I wasn\u2019t sure when Jake would pick her up as my calls weren\u2019t going through to him. \nMy parents came over for Christmas and the day Jake dropped Jenna off I rang them and asked if they could pick up some presents for her because it was a surprise she was here. They didn\u2019t mind and got her age appropriate items (bracelet making kit, lol surprises and a matching sweater to Kelly) then they\u2019d also let my brother and sil know Jenna is here and they\u2019d gotten her several more gifts (nail polish, stickers, a fluffy hat) to make up for her mom being sick. I also managed to pick her up some squish mallows and chocolates as well as get her a stocking which I added mini gifts(hair clips, play dough cute pens)\nSo on Christmas she had a similar amount of gifts to my daughter and nephew and she seemed really happy. Then last night Jake stopped to get her and said she\u2019s fine to go home so we packed her toys and she took them with her.\nThen a few hours later I got a call from a random number. It was Amy, Jake gave her my number. And she started yelling saying that I took her daughter for Christmas and then I spoiled her. \nI tried to calm her down but she hung up and so I texted her that I was sorry but I didn\u2019t mean to take her and it wasn\u2019t my fault Jake dropped her on me. She called me again saying that I should stop lying and that Jake told her how I showed up to his with my daughter and presents trying to upstage the presents she\u2019d sent to him for Jenna. \nI told her that Jake left Jenna at my house, and I sent her the screenshots of me asking him when he\u2019d going to pick Jenna up etc. I told her I\u2019m sorry he lied to you but it\u2019s not my problem.\n\nI only think I could be an ah because I knew Amy Isn\u2019t well off financially but still wanted Jenna to have lots of gifts so she wouldn\u2019t think about not being with her family.", "created_utc": 1672231497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx8ouz/aita_for_giving_my_daughters_half_sister_a_lot_of/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A lot of people in your position wouldn't have so much time for Jenna! Keep being an amazing person!\n\nEx needs to sort it out though, who dumps their kid onto someone else for several days with no contact when the mom doesn't know where they are! At least you have mom's number now!", "NTA. Your ex is the asshole here. You were trying to not make your ex\u2019s child jealous, after she was unexpectedly dropped at your house.", "NTA at all, what the fuck? You were being a wonderful person, Jake and Amy are being assholes and petty and need to get over their hurt egos that you wanted a little girl to feel involved.\n\nDo not blame yourself for this.", "Nta.\n\nHow to buy gift for Christmas to a child can be wrong?\n\nIn reality the mom probably just feels attacked and maybe think that you are trying to appear Better in front of the child or maybe return with the dad.", "NTA\n\nAmy is upset because she can't give Jenna the kind of Christmas gifts you could.\n\nHer own ego means she'd rather Jenna have nothing than something. That is really sad.\n\nYou need to tell your husband you will no longer take Jenna unless you have confirmation from Amy that she knows Jenna is with you. Period. \n\nAnd even if he says she knows - text/call her yourself so there's no misunderstanding.\n\nTruly this is the definition of \"no good deed goes unpunished\".\n\nSide note: your ex sounds like a total AH.", "NTA\nYou tried to make it fair between the children.\n\nYour ex doesn't seem to take any accountability", "NTA - this is really sweet of you and glad Jake is an ex as he's very toxic", "NTA. Jenna would have felt left out if she had gotten less. You did a nice thing for Jenna, her mother just can't see that", "Nta. Sounds like your ex is trying to play mind and power games with his daughter's mom. You were just trying to give his daughter a good Christmas while he was being a bad and manipulative dad.", "NTA. Obviously Jake is lying his ass off to both of you, telling you both completely different stories. \n\nYou acted reasonable for what you thought was true and were nice for giving her things. If I was poor and someone did that for my child I would be grateful. Het mother might have been too had it been under different circumstances.", "NTA all the way. Everything your ex did was wrong. I'd be seeing a custody lawyer real quick. If your ex is willing to lie and drop off his other child with a person the parent doesn't know he'll do the same with your kid. A parent gets to know where their underage children are all the time. Luckily you provide a safe space for the other kid but it's still wrong.", "Jake's the biggest asshole as he was apparently lying to *both* you and Amy (\"on the 22nd he dropped her off at my place claiming that Jenna\u2019s mother was ill and he couldn\u2019t watch Jenna\"; \"Jake told her how I showed up to his with my daughter and presents trying to upstage the presents she\u2019d sent to him for Jenna.\")\n\nI'm not sure I'm going to call Amy the asshole here, since Jake lied to her about what happened, and it's not *so* unusual to trust the word of the person you have a relationship with, over the word of a relative stranger. \n\nBut you're not an asshole making sure Jenna had an equal number of gifts to Kelly on Christmas. They weren't really big-ticket items; it's not like you bought her a PS5.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou were thinking about how the child will feel rather than anyone else, and it's not even your kid! \n\nHats off to you we need more people thinking this way", "NTA You got a surprise kid on Christmas and included her. Jenna's memory of that day will be. I got dropped off with my sister, I missed my mom terribly, but I was made to feel I belonged and included with everything, presents and all.", "NTA. You are an exceptionally good egg for having that little girl's back. I hope you continue, although noone has a right to expect it of you. It sounds like Jenna needs good people in her corner. She surely didn't do well in the parent-lottery. Poor thing.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. These kinds of events are things Jenna will cherish forever. You didn't spoil her, you gave a good kid a good Christmas. The gifts you got were nice, but nothing lavish or expensive.", "NTA. Your family is fantastic! Your Ex sucks and I hope the mother calms down enough later and apologizes.", "NTA your ex is clearing trying to put you and Amy against each other for some reason and he is absolutely TA. Who drops a kid off without giving you the contact information of the parents especially when he\u2019s not answering your calls. This whole thing is madness", "NTA! You were kind, generous, and made her feel loved. The fact that you and your family treated her as equal to your child, and not less than, is amazing. I\u2019m sorry if her mom feels bad she can\u2019t provide as much as you did, but I hope she realizes how the majority of people in your situation would have nothing to do with her child.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Jake is clearly lying to everyone here and that sucks. Hopefully you can work things out with her mom in the future so at least the 2 of you can get along and get the truth out there for each other.  But you and your family went above and beyond for this little girl to make her feel included and cared for which is awesome.  I am sure she will remember that in the future.", "NTA you sound like an amazing lady who is doing what is best for her child by including their half sibling. If you hadn't given Jenna gifts you can bet her mom would have been calling you all the names under the sun for excluding her kid. You were in a no win situation.\n\nBut please don't let this incident change how you treat Jenna. She will remember and appreciate the way you treat her. I know my step kid who is now and adult has thanked me and my family for how we always included them and how we never made them feel any different to their siblings.", "The girls share a father. According to OP her ex just didn\u2019t tell her he had another child until after they broke up.", "[deleted]", "Oh sorry for not clarifying, Jake is Kelly\u2019s father. Jake and Amy weren\u2019t together when me him were though he was active in Jenna\u2019s life. That\u2019s part of the reason we broke up- he never told me where he was going though he probably was seeing her", "Thank you for clarifying, that definitely changes things. It's a bit weird that you're daughter never goes with them though [unless thats a decision you made because you don't trust them]. But they get their alone time when Jenna comes over, you deserve a little alone time too! His daughter's should also both be able to see their father in his element. I'm sure Kelly wonders why she never gets to play at Jenna's house.", "NTA\n\nJake is playing both you and Amy. My guess: He was supposed to have Jenna for Christmas and give her presents both from him and Amy. For some reason he didn't feel like doing that (New woman he doesn't tell about his children? No motivation to watch Jenna/ have a tree/ do Christmas?) And instead of telling Amy he doesn't want to see Jenna on Christmas, which would make him look bad, he dumped her on you knowing full well, you would do everything to include her. But because he is an idiot, he didn't anticipate how it would play put after his booty call, panicked and just blamed it on you.", "You're NTA but you understand that Jake is literally ditching his child with you on his custody time to get out of parenting, right? Without his co-parent being aware?You have the woman's number, I think you start texting her every single time he leaves the child with you. \"Hey just so you know, Jake left Jenna with me. As always, happy to care for her, just wanted you to be aware of where your child is,\" or whatever. Personally I'd ask first if she wants that information, but if it happens on a holiday again, let her know as soon as the kid is with you regardless if she wants texts more generally. Just me, but I would also go a step further and suggest documentation in case she wants to alter her custody agreement? \"Hey would you like me to text you every time (ex) drops off Jenna here to make sure you know? If he leaves my daughter with you similarly, I'd love to know so that I could document it and get our custody agreement altered. If he's passing on Christmas with his child, that holiday should always not be his!\" or something.", "So your ex had his older daughter for xmas, didn't want her to interfere with his holiday plans, dumped her on you and then went MIA until after xmas? Then told his daughter's mum that the child was with him for xmas and you just randomly showed up with a bunch of gifts?\n\nYou are NTA, and you're a good person for fully including that wee girl in your family xmas. Your ex's ex is slightly TA in that yeah, she was lied to but she could have asked her daughter for clarification. Your ex though, he is a raging, diseased AH of epic proportions, and I hope his next shite is a hedgehog.", "NTA.   You treated her just like you would have wanted someone to treat your baby girl.  Cudos to you and your family for making that baby feel so welcome and loved.", "NTA. You sound like an absolute star and so do your family. \n\nWell done for sending the screen shots, clearly your AH ex fed her a pile of crap and now she\u2019s going to start seeing through his bullshit, which will work out better for everyone (except Jake). Maybe she\u2019ll wake up and you guys can arrange your daughters\u2019 relationship without the help of dickwad dad.", "NTA \n\nbut your ex is playing games that will cause problems between the siblings and you and the other mother. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would tread very carefully.", "Nta\nIt would go along way though to text Amy and tell her her daughter is amazing kid and that she is clearly a darn good mother.", "NTA, but your ex is a lying dillhole and needs to be called out. At least you exposed his lies... Kinda curious to know how that went. I'm betting he didn't want to have the kid at his place so he could bang someone and Amy getting sick was perfectly convenient timing.", "NTA, but learn yo use paragraphs.   Your post was so unnecessarily wordy it made my head spin.", "Amy can be forgiven because she was lied to. Their ex on the other hand is an absolute donkey's ass.", "Amy was still an AH for believing her ex's BS, not talking to her 7yr old to find out what really happened, and for going in immediately aggressive instead of talking to OP like a normal person."]}
