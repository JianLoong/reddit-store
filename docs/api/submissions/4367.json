Not a big deal most times but every once and while we come across houses like the one today. This house sits in a curve in the middle of a hill.

When I go to back into the driveway the customer comes running out yelling that \u201cI better not pull into her drive\u201d, I try to explain through the window why I\u2019m doing it and I kid you not she says \u201cidc this driveway is not for you to be lazy just do your job\u201d.

Before I even got done with my route I was hearing calls saying this lady had called and said I was rude and refused to deliver her packages to her. I told them what happened and now I have a sit down with management to discuss.

I'm sorry, you're not. Yes, I am all for having a great work ethic, but let's look at it this way. She stopped you from doing your job. You also don't know if this woman was nuts enough to ATTACK you! She purposely waited for the next delivery driver just to go running out like a mad woman! Blocking someone from pulling in and out of a driveway while doing their job? Really?", "NTA this job is not worth your life or the life of someone who doesn't see you coming around the corner. Unnecessary hazards should never, ever be a job requirement.", "NTA. One purpose for drive ways is exactly so that deliveries can be made safely. I don't know what is wrong with this individual. But you're well within your rights to insist on having appropriate access to their front door that does not place either yourself or other drivers in danger.", "NTA\n\nThis woman seems a bit crazy. I wonder what she would do if a repair person needed to park in the driveway, or if she was getting a delivery of a refrigerator or some other big, heavy item.\n\nGo online and get some maps of the road and driveway. Print them out to show management why parking on the road isn't safe.", "NTA you cant be expected to create a traffic hazard. I want to know why she cares? Id have done the same", "NTA but I'll be honest dial back your explanation for the managers when you go in. Large corporations don't give a damn about employees and will use anything to protect themselves. I'd go with something simple like \"I couldn't stop where I was because it's a safety issue but homeowner was physically blocking the driveway and calling me lazy, so when she told me to just go I listened and went on with my route...\"", "This seems like one of those situations where you're NTA, but unfortunately part of your job is dealing with AHs so being in the right might not do you much good", "Info: Why wouldn\u2019t you be allowed to pull into her driveway in general?", "NTA,\n\nShe shooed you away, quite rudely too.\n\nI hate it when delivery trucks block the road and create hazards to drive around them.  \n\nIf she refuses to let you use her driveway, then she can go pick up her packages from the depot on her own time and expense.", "NTA, make sure to reiterate to management that you agreed to pull in. Info: did you say anything to her...?", "You're never TA for choosing safety, my friend. You did good. NTA", "NTA.  Frame it this way to management: that you knew the risks there and if someone gets injured or killed because of a preventable accident then your company is liable.   Then cherry it by standing on your morals and saying you won't endanger innocent people for this.", "NTA.  Your safety matter too.  If she didn't want you in her drive, she can drive and park (in a safe parking lot!) and get her packages herself.", "NTA. I always assumed delivery drivers would use my driveway if I had one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You were trying to create a safe traffic pattern. She stopped you from delivering the packages. I\u2019ll never understand people being rude for no reason to people who are just trying to do their job and deliver them a service. Mind blowing.", "She refused you access to her property. You could have left her package right at the berm and you know she would have been furious at that too. I don't understand why she wouldn't let you onto the driveway. Please update us on what your boss says. Maybe you can show the property on Google maps and explain the danger of parking on the road. Imagine how bad an accident could be.", "NTA You did exactly the right thing. Its absurd for her to expect you to put other people in danger because she both wants her packages and won't allow you to safely park to get them out of the truck!", "NTA! I used to deliver for the big A company and I completely get it. Management specifically told you to do this, and you did. Safety is what matters most", "Morality wise, nta.\n\nJob wise, yta.\n\nI would have stopped right where I was and waved her package like a carrot.  \"Im not stopping again just to comeback. Do you want this or going to wait until next time?\"", "[removed]", "No.She was.", "NTA. I live on a narrow, winding, hilly road, and people routinely park service vehicles in the middle of the road. I understand the difficulty of backing in to every driveway, but I'm certain that this practice of idling in the street will eventually cause a fatal head-on collision on our street. Next time, that woman can stand in the road and direct traffic while you dump her packages on the porch. Maybe if she gets her ass out in the street, she will realize what a hazard your vehicle is creating.", "NTA. YOU as an individual have a responsibility to not endanger other drivers. That means idling on the road is not OK. Your company has the same responsibility.\n\nThis person may have a legitimate reason for not having anyone in her driveway ( idk expecting an ambulance or a fire truck). So you did the right thing by driving away and respecting her space. \n\nGiven these conditions, I would suggest to your management that they consider drones, if they don\u2019t mind the expense.", "NTA. Stand up for yourself. Get a union rep if you have a Union.", "ESH but only barely. She was being crazy but I can definitely imagine her frustration about what you did as well. It can be hard to deal with angry people who don't want to listen to you, so I would've just delivered the package and told my manager that she doesn't want me to use her driveway and ask for suggestions on what to do.\n\nAccording to their [Terms of Service](https://www.fedex.com/content/dam/fedex/us-united-states/services/Service_Guide_2022.pdf) they can decide not to deliver if:\n\n>The shipment would likely cause damage or delay to other shipments or property **or injury to personnel.**", "YTA unfortunately. Its your job. If a customer doesn't want you on their property (as in vehicle wise) you have to respect that. After what just happened with the little girl in Texas, & people being accosted by service providers, maybe she felt it was safer to not have a vehicle on the property. I would have just handed her the package from the window, and advised her due to the dangerous situation, her packages have to be picked up from now on, or they will be left at the end of the property line.", "Agreed your safety should come first do employers think they shouldn\u2019t protect their employees from people who do this.", "Just leave her packages at the mailbox...by the side of the road.", "Honestly have no intention on explaining the situation again.

Some employers don't really care. They care more about dealing with the bottom line. \n\nWe live at the end of the block and we get delivery trucks turn around using all of our driveways.

NTA, none of these questions would change my opinion.  \n\nIf she\u2019d shown any interest in discussing a different alternative with you or making something work that might be one thing.  Demanding that you put yourself and/or others at risk like that justifies your response.", "That\u2019s nuts. Our guy comes all the way down our driveway (almost a mile long) and through our gate. NTA though.", "Yeah, you did your best, it sounds like. NTA. It should be fine. I'm certainly interested in having an update after your meeting, if you're up to it. Best of luck.", "I\u2019m sure when the lawsuits and bills from hospitals add up you think they\u2019ll change their tune about it.", "And doesn't it say in the post that the MANAGERS already decided that OP should pull into the driveway?", "Honestly dont know the reason why? I think its mostly not getting stuck and destroying private property. We do drive any driveway that would take longer than 1 minute to walk as long as is wide enough."]}
