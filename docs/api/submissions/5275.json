My family rarely chat in the group unless there is a big life event happening or we are organsing a family event. Earlier this year, one of my aunties asked if anyone had any life updates to share. My cousin (F30) had a particularly big life update and annouced she got engaged to her partner of 7 years first.  All the family including myself congratulated her and I was genuinely very happy. I didn't think too much of it at the time but I thought since we were going around sharing our life updates, I thought it would only be fitting to announce my pregnancy in the group chat as well. All my family congratulated me as well and everyone seemed really excited about my baby news including my cousin. \n\nA couple of days later, my cousin messages a long paragraph absolutely furious. She accused me of stealing her spotlight announcing my pregnancy on the same day as her engagement, although she seemed happy for me in the group chat the day before. I immediately apologised to her and felt so guilty after the fact. My cousin never messages me back after my apology and I didn't talk to her again for the rest of my pregnancy. \n\nI feel really sad about all this as its now formed a wedge between my mum and my aunty as they have taken sides. To top it all off several months later, my beautiful baby daughter was born on the same day as my cousin's birthday (co-incidence right?). I have very recently given birth to a beautiful daughter and I wanted to make a baby announcement on the day she was born. However I could not bring myself to do it because my cousin just turned 30 which is a huge milestone. I am already not on speaking terms with my cousin and her family just over this and don't want to steal my cousin's spotlight a second time.

Mother/daughter or aunt/niece? Is there any chance that your aunt's question was a setup or a prompt, planned for your cousin to announce her engagement?

It's not like she out of the blue announced it and you announced your pregnancy as well at that time. I would have just messaged people individually on the birth announcement, but even if you did it in the group chat wouldn't have mattered, which 30 yo makes a big deal about their birthday?", "NTA at all. Why on Earth is your cousins engagement more significant than your pregnancy?  And even if it was bad form to announce your pregnancy right after she announced the engagement, you apologized as soon as you learned that it hurt her. And she didn't talk to you for the rest of your pregnancy. What is that? Announce the birth of your child. Starting a life is as significant as living one for 30 years. You have every right to celebrate your life, please don't let your aunt or your cousin make you believe that you're less important than she is", "NTA look I get it your cousin wants to have her moment but it\u2019s not like you announced it at her wedding. Her reaction afterwards to you however and the rift she has caused by overreacting makes her TA. You were asked for big news and you shared your news, yes you could have waited but why would you need to. If you had announced your pregnancy first would she have not announced her engagement?", "I don't understand the Y T A. Yes, she announced it after her cousin, BUT would the cousin have announced it then, if the aunt hadn't asked for life updates? \n\nIn my opinion, the fact that, as it seems, this all came after the aunts question, absolves OP.", "NTA. Family asked if anyone had news to share. Anyone. Not specifically just your cousin. Also, you can\u2019t help when your baby was born. Your cousin is one of thousands of people with that same birthday. Celebrate your kid on her actual birthday. Your cousin is ridiculous. Main Character Syndrome. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA because if she wanted to make this announcement previously she could have, I'm assuming.

It was one of those things where you overstepped a social norm a bit, and people are allowed to feel some type of way about it, but it\u2019s not like you did anything terrible. \n\nBut if she just hadn\u2019t bothered to tell the family until someone happened to ask for updates, then it seems odd to me that she\u2019d accuse anyone of \u201cstealing the spotlight\u201d, bc she intentionally chose to tell the family at a time when multiple people would be sharing news? Like sure, she probably didn\u2019t expect anyone else to have an update as big as hers, but did she just expect no one else to answer your aunt\u2019s question? \n\nUnless there\u2019s some long-standing pattern of disrespect this is the sort of thing that I genuinely don\u2019t understand anyone making a fuss about", "NTA and the whole idea that a single message in a group chat automatically means no one can say anything interesting for a week is completely insane. You both had announcements, so you both announced them. It's not like people can't pay attention to two things at once. Are you supposed to remember everything everyone has announced? For how long? And in a group chat of all things! This is an insane thing for someone to get angry about, and the whole idea of 'someone's day' or 'someone's moment' is ridiculous. Two people can have moments!", "NTA. I swear people are ridiculous. Get over it. These are happy things to be embraced and ppl are acting like children over it. The Aunt asked they responded. Move on. She delayed announcing her child's birth for Christ sakes because these ppl are too sensitive. Just imagine how annoying they will be cause her kids birthday is the same as her cousins. \nSure you want to feel special. I get it. But people in your life don't break or crumble if you give them one good thing to be excited about and another on top of it. Like? WTF. Y'all need to move on. Because it's ridiculous.

Well idk Fran your about to have a bridal shower, a bachelorette party and a whole freaking wedding that will be all about you. I'm sure you will make it. Time to move on. Celebrate your new baby.

Good luck out there", "Okay, so. I guess it's American thing, about announcing stuff, but to me it's absolutely baffling. \"Stole her spotlight\" ?

You were asked about life updates. Why was only one person allowed to share theirs?", "NTA. They asked for news, they got news. Why can\u2019t good things happen to two people in the family?", "NTA. Jfc why can\u2018t two people in the same family have exciting, happy things happening in their lives and share their happiness and why does and why does someone need \u201ethe spotlight\u201c for getting engaged. Don\u2018t you get engaged and married for you and your partner?", "NTA, but was the aunt who asked your cousin's mother? If so, I bet the question was specifically directed to her making her engagement announcement, and you unwittingly stepped into their grand plan. But that's what they get for setting it up that way, and you genuinely answered her question. It's not like Auntie said, \"Hey, Cousin, why don't you share your news?\" She is the one who asked an open question, and your response to her question by sharing your good news was entirely appropriate.\n\nHonestly, they sound exhausting. You can't send a baby announcement because your cousin is 30? Stop worrying about offending these people. They'll be offended anyhow.\n\n(Edit to correct typo)", "NTA. \n\nIt was a group chat, the question was directed at everybody. Both of you had news and got to tell it. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s also an US thing, but making a pregnancy or engagement announcement a \u201ething\u201c always seems quite overblown to me.

One of the people in the chat asked about any life updates. You didn't go to her engagement party and steal the spotlight. Huge difference. I would have made the birth announcement anyway. Don't let her conceit dim your joy.", "NTA. If you'd answered the text first, was she supposed to just shut up about her news? They're acting like you stole all the attention at her engagement party.", "I came expecting to say y t a, but since you made your announcement in response to your aunt literally asking if anyone had any life updates to share, definitely NTA.", "NTA. Please go ahead and live your life and celebrate as you see fit. You don\u2019t have to tip toe around everyone\u2019s feelings because clearly no one is considering yours.", "NTA\n\nYou were asked a question and both of you answered", "NTA- if the big announcement was that important to your cousin, why not text or call family outside of the group chat?? Big fuss over nothing. Congratulations on the birth of your baby!", "INFO: Was the aunt who asked  about updates this cousin\u2019s mom?\n\nYou\u2019re definitely NTA, but it would explain the overreacting if the aunt asked the question in the group chat to set up a not so random way for her daughter to announce her engagement. They just failed to consider other people might also have big news to share. And that\u2019s not your problem.", "INFO: Did your auntie as for the life updates earlier this year or earlier that day? That would\nchange my judgment.\n\nYou say \u201cearlier this year\u201d so to me that means you should have waited because it wasn\u2019t a pressing question.", "YTA because you took her engagement announcement as a competition of sorts. It\u2019s not a general life update, it\u2019s a bit announcement.", "NTA they asked for updates on everyone's life. You answered the question! Now had it been a party for her to announce her engagement it would be different. She sounds spoiled to me. The family can be just as happy for her news as they were yours. Enjoy that beautiful baby \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Fuck your cousin and everything they stand for.", "NTA, because you apologized after. I get her feelings but as long as you didn\u2019t mean to upstage her, and you apologized, she needs to get over it", "NTA. Based on their reaction, my guess is that your aunt sent the \u201canyone have any news?\u201d as way to specifically cue her daughter into announcing her engagement. She didn\u2019t intend for it to be a share out by everyone, but her wording backfired and you couldn\u2019t have known that at the time.", "NTA. I\u2019m pretty sure you didn\u2019t find out your were pregnant the same time she got engaged. Your aunt asked a question and you both responded. BTW don\u2019t be her bridesmaid if she asks. She already sounds like a bridezilla.", "NTA Sharing Good News on a Family Group chat is not a bad thing.", "NTA \n\nIt's a group chat! And your aunt asked a question to everyone. \nNow, if it had been at a party, she organized to announce it that's different, but it's a group chat. Says like your cousin has some underlying issues", "NTA\n\nYou answered a question addressed to everyone. This wasnt a dinner she set up to announce it. You have every right to share your news.\n\nSecond I'd have screen shot her messages and put them on the group chat\n\nThird she's an adult - why would she be jealous over a baby's birthdate? Why are you letting her insecurities take over your relationship with the rest of the family. Your daughters birthdate is a fact. Big deal she is 30 how is the family wishing you well going to detract from her birthday.\n\nIf she wants to get offended let her. Also your daughter is more important than a cousin. A child's birthday is more important. Dont hide her from her families love and attention because of a spoilt person.\n\nAlso within family - the more good news the better. There shouldnt be jealousy.", "NTA! Congratulations on your baby girl. You deserve to share whatever you'd like, whenever, especially such a huge milestone for you! Emotionally mature adults can hold space for their milestones and still be excited and happy for anyone else's, no matter the day.", "NTA - it was a group chat answering a question. What if you would have beat your cousin to the punch and announced first? Would she have held her news in.\n\nI'd say maybe if the cousin had arranged a dinner to announce it, then it could appear to be upstaging. \n\nBut this situation is utterly ridiculous.", "The only situation where you would be considered T A is if the cousin had a specific event organized around her engagement announcement and you went there planning to upstage her with your announcement. You did not, it was a casual thing over a chat that no one planned. Would she have been the A H if you had announced your news 1st? Cause she would have stolen your spotlight then. NTA.", "NTA it wasn't some event that she planned otherwiseyou would have been. your aunt asked a question and you answered her. just announce the birth if you haven't already and enjoy those precious cuddles with your daughter especially as they do not stay little for long.", "Y'know what? I'll go against the grain here and say it, yeah YTA.\n\nWould it have killed you to wait one or two more days to announce your pregnancy? No. \n\nI get the idea that you stealing the limelight from your cousin may not be a first time occurrence and announcing a pregnancy *just after* someone else announced an engagement is a social faux pas.\n\nIts also very normal to wait a few days after birth before announcing it to extended family. So you did the right think there.\n\nSorry OP, but i think you cop the blame here.", "Nta! Ngl either I would say ops cousin is upset because she didn't expect someone else to have great news, and instead of her being excited she's bitter.", "Yep. YTA", "Definitely NTA. It.sounds like you over-apologized and your cousin has a victim mentality.", "YUP. YTA.  She shared her happiness and you were so uncaring about this major life event that you had to Bogart it.  Yours could have easily waited. Even just 24 hours. Your default position was yourself. Not empathy and kindness.", "NTA\n\nIf you announced you were pregnant at a family dinner after your cousin announced their engagement then I'd have a different opinion, but it's a family group chat.\n\nCrazy coincidence on the shared birthday though \ud83d\ude00", "Gentle YTA \n\nIt sounds more like your aunt was setting the scene for your cousin to share her news tbh", "Definitely on the fourth point - the announcement was just on family group chat, not at an engagement party \ud83d\ude44 I mean seriously the whole point of the group chat is to share family news.", "The fourth part is the weirdest especially since OP apologized.", "Agreed.  If the cousin had went out of her way to make a special announcement that's one thing - but everyone asked if they had news to share.  Not op's fault.\n\nThe birthday thing is just bad luck though.  Baby seems to be a wee bit of a drama-stirring troll, I'd be proud.", "I agree with everything.\n\nIn my country, Italy, the concept of \u201cstealing the spotlight\u201d is not even a thing, you can be happy for  two people. Unless it\u2019s something so unusual to be considered rude, but I never see it happen. \n\nHere people don\u2019t crave being the center of attention. \n\nAlso it I would like to point out that it was a f*** group chat! \n\nI mean it wasn\u2019t a dinner / party organised by the cousin with the purpose of making a big announcement, even that wouldn\u2019t be considered weird in my country, more reason to celebrate, you\u2019re just sharing news, but I could maybe see the point of \u201corganise your own party\u201d if you\u2019re into that\u2026 but a group chat.. come on\n\nIt was probably sandwiched between a good morning gif and a meme.", "My thoughts exactly.  Why can't two happy events be on the same day?  Why are people so obsessed with being in the spotlight by themselves that they can't be happy for someone else at the same time?  I don't understand that at all.  It seems very narcissistic to me.", "Hold.on, Ima let you finish, but first...", "I actually think the cousin is TA because OP has apologised. I feel like it\u2019s a very toxic relationship, one of those act nice and happy in front of people when in actual fact she\u2019s not and even scolded OP and not accept her apology, not even talking to her after she\u2019s given birth.", "I\u2019d personally be even more happy to hear good news from more people in my family! Omg you\u2019re engaged? Congrats! And this other person is pregnant!? Omg what wonderful news everyone!", "Why women absolutely needs their spotlight moment and adopt such destructive behaviour for jealousy is beyond me\n\nNTA", "Exactly \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\n\nIf OP had announced her pregnancy first, would her cousin have kept the engagement quiet? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nNTA", "I agree with this based on how OP describes the situation, but I would change my decision if there were obvious signs the family member asking about updates was really just trying to cue up the cousin to share their news and OP didn\u2019t read the situation correctly.", "The kind of thirty year old who holds a grudge about someone announcing a big event the same day they did, even when they were both responding to a general question", "There was a post yesterday where OP was deemed absolutely the asshole for rescheduling her wedding to a bridesmaid's 30th birthday, so apparently a lot of them do", "After 21, it seems 30 is a milestone birthday that gets celebrated for many.", "Is the aunty that asked the mom of the cousin who announced the engagement? If so, it was probably a coordinated set up for the cousin to announce. \n\nIf OP hadn\u2019t thought to update everyone until then, waiting a few days or weeks wouldn\u2019t have hurt anyone. I don\u2019t think announcing her pregnancy was an asshole move, but it also wasn\u2019t the most thoughtful timing either.", "I suspect there\u2019s a chance the aunt asked about life updates because she knew the cousin was engaged, and that\u2019s how they wanted to let the family know.\n\nI think it would have been more tactful to wait a week or so to announce the pregnancy, but answering a question that was asked doesn\u2019t make OP an asshole.", "Yeah, the point of a casual group chat is to be casual. If cousin wanted a whole affair specifically about her announcement, she should have organized one.", ">Unless there\u2019s some long-standing pattern of disrespect this is the sort of thing\n\nIt does seem a little bit like \"missing reasons\" to me, i wonder if this is thecfirst time this has happened.", "This is my question too. My first thought was that it sounds like a setup. And if aunt and cousin pre-planned the exchange, I can see why cousin was thinking of it as \"her time\" to share her news and why she sees OP as butting in on her announcement. I don't agree, but I could see where she's coming from. Like the other commenter said, definitely poorly executed if so.", "And being pregnant is also not a general life update, it is a big announcement as well.", "Next time.  LOL", "It was a set up. The aunt posted what she did to create that opening for the cousin to make her announcement. In their minds, only their news was important and to be shared.\n\nOP didn't do anything wrong - the aunt and cousin are just unwilling to share the spotlight and didn't even fathom that there would be other important news to share.\n\nThe family chat should be made smaller with just siblings and parents.", ">In my country, Italy, the concept of \u201cstealing the spotlight\u201d is not even a thing, you can be happy for two people. Unless it\u2019s something so unusual to be considered rude, but I never see it happen.\n\nAlso Italian, I can confirm that. When I announced my engagement last year, my family said we'd celebrate the next week at my grandparents (we see each other most weeks). That day my cousin announced she was pregnant with her third child and my uncle announced he's made partner at the firm he works at. We just celebrated all three announcement everyone was happy about all three things.", "As an American-- it's something I have only experienced on reddit, and never in real life.  No one in my family would care and neither would any of my friends.  But I've never experienced a lot of the other drama that gets posted about daily on this sub either so maybe my personal circle is just dull.", "I like that way of seeing it.", "Looking at the comments sorted by old, a lot were saying Y T A. \n\nIt is unfortunate though that this situation has caused a lot of drama amongst OP\u2019s family (through no fault of her own, obviously). I hope that everyone is able to reconcile at some point.", "That's the impression I get, especially if the aunt who asked is the cousin's mother.", "I mean, that was probably the intention, but it's a group text message. How are you supposed to read the intentions? It's not like a holiday meal where she'd be obviously looking straight at the cousin when asking or something.", "Ohh that\u2019s a good point. I didn\u2019t think of it that way", "Yea well. Then they shouldn't have asked a general question to the entire family in the group chat. Should have said something like \"Cousin, donyou have anything new going on?\"", "Then that also answers the question of whether that family is unnecessarily dramatic, passive aggressive, fake, and attention seeking. They either need to just make the announcement or organize an event.", "Oh wow, that's really wow. I'm in my 30s, I genuinely don't know anyone who made a big deal about their 30th birthday. Maybe it's an American thing? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Not that I have heard or seen in my experience. Maybe not in my part of the world.", "Only the top comment counts to the vote.", "She was asked a question and answered it. People need to stop thinking that their engagements and weddings mean that nobody is allowed to celebrate anything else or talk about anything else.  So much ridiculous entitlement", "It's a little bit wrong to say an engagement is not a big deal. It's an important milestone for some people, and that's completely alright. Getting pregnant is not hard either (for most people) but it's still an important event in a family right?", "That's what I'm thinking too. That's why I want to know the relationship \u2013 I can see a mother setting this up for her daughter, but not an aunt for a niece. And if it is mother/daughter then I think it's pretty obtuse of OP to not realise that it was a setup.\n\nIt strikes me as very odd that someone who'd get her knickers in a twist over having her spotlight stolen would wait to be asked before stepping into that spotlight. It has to have been a setup.", "Only to the people getting engaged.", "(cough cough) and mainly females...", "Ngl I think OP seems ridiculous with the birthday thing. If I had a kid there\u2019s zero chance they wouldn\u2019t get birthdays because my no contact cousin\u2019s birthday is also on that day. Even considering doing that to her kid makes her a bit of an A for me (but I realize that\u2019s not the AITA question here). \n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear anyone has asked OP not to celebrate they\u2019re just randomly extending this drama with the birthday stuff. I have some family like this & it\u2019s exhausting. Just a constant competition for who has been more victimized. \n\nI don\u2019t think OP\u2019s the ass here but she needs to grow a spine to protect her kid from her relatives if this isn\u2019t a victimization competition", "People came at me HARD for saying that a woman who had a miscarriage was **NOT** a monster for 1- not liking birthday parties in general, 2- not coming to the birth day parties of a child who would be almost to the day the same age as a child she lost to miscarriage 3- still wanted to be invited to other events in case she did want to attend. \n\nBecause this is Reddit. So yeah you never know", "Thank you! \ud83d\udc4f In my opinion Reddit is full of mostly insane responses at times so yep, We know about flying monkeys and the spaghetti monster.", "You can sort by old?!  I can\u2019t figure that out and wish I could ha", "That\u2019s why I said \u201cif there were obvious signs.\u201d I\u2019m not implying that OP is in the wrong.", "I'm American. I didn't make a big deal out of my 30th either. My sister's husband threw her a surprise party on her 30th, but other than that, I don't know anyone who really cares about birthdays past their 21st.", "Parents having babies often do the same thing\u2026.\n\nI say this as a mother of two.", "I can see how you would call OP obtuse for not seeing it, but some of us can be pretty clueless about these types of things (as clued in as we try to sound on reddit).", "Yah, lol.

Not sure how it is on the app, or other devices.", "Technically you sort by new and just scroll to the bottom, but it gives the same result haha", "I know, I'm just saying I can't see how there would be signs obvious enough through text, lol. Maybe if the aunt didn't ask if anyone had something to share, and instead asked if the cousin did? But then you'd expect more of op's family to be mad at her.", "And yet this person didn't do that so why mention it?", "If you're close enough to be in a group chat with a cousin you'd probably be impacted (or at least happy) if your cousin is having a baby. I have cousins with babies and it was significant to me.", "It\u2019s not so much a contest as it is stealing someone\u2019s moment.", "On the app there\u2019s only \u201cnew\u201d. But \u201cnew\u201d then scrolling to the bottom will give you the same result, just with a bit more scrolling required.", "Thanks!! Yes, I normally want it when they\u2019ve deleted or when someone says \u201cmore info in comment\u201d and of course that\u2019s always a time when there are 50K comments and I don\u2019t want to scroll.

I care about my cousins and I would care about both life events.", "Problem is - she had no moment, just little chat in family group. It's regular thing that occurred in her life as regular as having a baby. She had no right to send op hateful message because they both had something important to tell about. She was petty and immature in doing so.\nAnd also this thing with announcements and spotlights is really weird and does not work especially in such situations.", "My app has the old option. (Android)", "I use the app and I can sort oldest first. Maybe the apps are different on different phone types.", "Get BaconReader or Redditisfun, they both have options for sort by old.

People can have their spotlights at parties, at weddings, at showers and all of that. People will be there celebrating with you because they are happy you are happy or because of social obligations or whatever. \n\nA group chat is not that. It is a place to communicate. That day they were asked to communicate life events.
