My cousin never messages me back after my apology and I didn't talk to her again for the rest of my pregnancy. \n\nI feel really sad about all this as its now formed a wedge between my mum and my aunty as they have taken sides.

Mother/daughter or aunt/niece? Is there any chance that your aunt's question was a setup or a prompt, planned for your cousin to announce her engagement? Or is it just pure coincidence that your aunt asked the question just as she got engaged?", "I'm going to say NTA, your aunt asked and you both responded. It's not like she out of the blue announced it and you announced your pregnancy as well at that time. I would have just messaged people individually on the birth announcement, but even if you did it in the group chat wouldn't have mattered, which 30 yo makes a big deal about their birthday?", "NTA at all. Why on Earth is your cousins engagement more significant than your pregnancy?  And even if it was bad form to announce your pregnancy right after she announced the engagement, you apologized as soon as you learned that it hurt her. And she didn't talk to you for the rest of your pregnancy. What is that? Announce the birth of your child. Starting a life is as significant as living one for 30 years. You have every right to celebrate your life, please don't let your aunt or your cousin make you believe that you're less important than she is", "NTA look I get it your cousin wants to have her moment but it\u2019s not like you announced it at her wedding. Her reaction afterwards to you however and the rift she has caused by overreacting makes her TA. You were asked for big news and you shared your news, yes you could have waited but why would you need to. If you had announced your pregnancy first would she have not announced her engagement?", "I don't understand the Y T A. Yes, she announced it after her cousin, BUT would the cousin have announced it then, if the aunt hadn't asked for life updates? \n\nIn my opinion, the fact that, as it seems, this all came after the aunts question, absolves OP.", "NTA. Family asked if anyone had news to share. Anyone. Not specifically just your cousin. Also, you can\u2019t help when your baby was born. Your cousin is one of thousands of people with that same birthday. Celebrate your kid on her actual birthday. Your cousin is ridiculous. Main Character Syndrome. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA because if she wanted to make this announcement previously she could have, I'm assuming. Nothing stopped her from texting pictures and updates on the engagement to everyone the day it happened. \n\nIf she had messaged everything (without being asked) and then you announced that day you were pregnant I'd think that would be thoughtless, but in this context I feel like she overreacted.", "INFO: how long had your cousin been engaged when this happened? \n\nIf this was her first opportunity to announce it to the family, then I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole but I can understand her being frustrated. It was one of those things where you overstepped a social norm a bit, and people are allowed to feel some type of way about it, but it\u2019s not like you did anything terrible. \n\nBut if she just hadn\u2019t bothered to tell the family until someone happened to ask for updates, then it seems odd to me that she\u2019d accuse anyone of \u201cstealing the spotlight\u201d, bc she intentionally chose to tell the family at a time when multiple people would be sharing news? Like sure, she probably didn\u2019t expect anyone else to have an update as big as hers, but did she just expect no one else to answer your aunt\u2019s question? \n\nUnless there\u2019s some long-standing pattern of disrespect this is the sort of thing that I genuinely don\u2019t understand anyone making a fuss about", "NTA and the whole idea that a single message in a group chat automatically means no one can say anything interesting for a week is completely insane. You both had announcements, so you both announced them. It's not like people can't pay attention to two things at once. Are you supposed to remember everything everyone has announced? For how long? And in a group chat of all things! This is an insane thing for someone to get angry about, and the whole idea of 'someone's day' or 'someone's moment' is ridiculous. Two people can have moments!", "NTA. I swear people are ridiculous. Get over it. These are happy things to be embraced and ppl are acting like children over it. The Aunt asked they responded. Move on. She delayed announcing her child's birth for Christ sakes because these ppl are too sensitive. Just imagine how annoying they will be cause her kids birthday is the same as her cousins. \nSure you want to feel special. I get it. But people in your life don't break or crumble if you give them one good thing to be excited about and another on top of it. Like? WTF. Y'all need to move on. Because it's ridiculous. Waaah you ruined my engagement announcement with your baby news how will I ever get over it? Well idk Fran your about to have a bridal shower, a bachelorette party and a whole freaking wedding that will be all about you. I'm sure you will make it. Time to move on. Celebrate your new baby.

Good luck out there", "Okay, so. I guess it's American thing, about announcing stuff, but to me it's absolutely baffling. \"Stole her spotlight\" ? Seriously?\nIt's fucking race or what?\nUsually when someone tells about their life event no one gives absolute shit about it honestly. \nIt's sounds extremely immature of her to expect that her life events that important to other people, especially extended family.\nThere were no spotlight in the first place.\nNTA.", "NTA your aunt asked and you answered. Tbh it sounds like your aunt and cousin were in collusion to make a big deal over your cousin and it backfired!", "NTA, what spotlight are they talking about anyways? The mandatory congratulation and \"do you allready have a date for the wedding/child\" ?\nThe really interested people will text directly anyways, and I'm sure the can text both your cousin and you.", "NTA. You were asked about life updates. Why was only one person allowed to share theirs?", "NTA. They asked for news, they got news. Why can\u2019t good things happen to two people in the family?", "NTA. Jfc why can\u2018t two people in the same family have exciting, happy things happening in their lives and share their happiness and why does and why does someone need \u201ethe spotlight\u201c for getting engaged. Don\u2018t you get engaged and married for you and your partner?", "NTA, but was the aunt who asked your cousin's mother? If so, I bet the question was specifically directed to her making her engagement announcement, and you unwittingly stepped into their grand plan. But that's what they get for setting it up that way, and you genuinely answered her question. It's not like Auntie said, \"Hey, Cousin, why don't you share your news?\" She is the one who asked an open question, and your response to her question by sharing your good news was entirely appropriate.\n\nHonestly, they sound exhausting. You can't send a baby announcement because your cousin is 30? Stop worrying about offending these people. They'll be offended anyhow.\n\n(Edit to correct typo)", "NTA. \n\nIt was a group chat, the question was directed at everybody. Both of you had news and got to tell it. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s also an US thing, but making a pregnancy or engagement announcement a \u201ething\u201c always seems quite overblown to me.

An engagement announcement pales in comparison to a new life being brought to this Earth. Your aunt asked for updates, so you both shared updates.

Why are you letting her insecurities take over your relationship with the rest of the family. Your daughters birthdate is a fact. Big deal she is 30 how is the family wishing you well going to detract from her birthday.\n\nIf she wants to get offended let her. Also your daughter is more important than a cousin. A child's birthday is more important. Dont hide her from her families love and attention because of a spoilt person.\n\nAlso within family - the more good news the better. There shouldnt be jealousy.", "NTA! Congratulations on your baby girl. You deserve to share whatever you'd like, whenever, especially such a huge milestone for you!

No. \n\nI get the idea that you stealing the limelight from your cousin may not be a first time occurrence and announcing a pregnancy *just after* someone else announced an engagement is a social faux pas.\n\nIts also very normal to wait a few days after birth before announcing it to extended family.

Why can't two happy events be on the same day?  Why are people so obsessed with being in the spotlight by themselves that they can't be happy for someone else at the same time?  I don't understand that at all.  It seems very narcissistic to me.", "Hold.on, Ima let you finish, but first...", "I actually think the cousin is TA because OP has apologised.

My first thought was that it sounds like a setup. And if aunt and cousin pre-planned the exchange, I can see why cousin was thinking of it as \"her time\" to share her news and why she sees OP as butting in on her announcement. I don't agree, but I could see where she's coming from. Like the other commenter said, definitely poorly executed if so.", "And being pregnant is also not a general life update, it is a big announcement as well.", "Next time.  LOL", "It was a set up. The aunt posted what she did to create that opening for the cousin to make her announcement. In their minds, only their news was important and to be shared.\n\nOP didn't do anything wrong - the aunt and cousin are just unwilling to share the spotlight and didn't even fathom that there would be other important news to share.\n\nThe family chat should be made smaller with just siblings and parents.", ">In my country, Italy, the concept of \u201cstealing the spotlight\u201d is not even a thing, you can be happy for two people.

When I announced my engagement last year, my family said we'd celebrate the next week at my grandparents (we see each other most weeks).

I didn\u2019t think of it that way", "Yea well. Then they shouldn't have asked a general question to the entire family in the group chat. Should have said something like \"Cousin, donyou have anything new going on?\"", "Then that also answers the question of whether that family is unnecessarily dramatic, passive aggressive, fake, and attention seeking. They either need to just make the announcement or organize an event.", "Oh wow, that's really wow. I'm in my 30s, I genuinely don't know anyone who made a big deal about their 30th birthday.

That's why I want to know the relationship \u2013 I can see a mother setting this up for her daughter, but not an aunt for a niece. And if it is mother/daughter then I think it's pretty obtuse of OP to not realise that it was a setup.\n\nIt strikes me as very odd that someone who'd get her knickers in a twist over having her spotlight stolen would wait to be asked before stepping into that spotlight.

Her face lit up, I gave her a big ol' goofy grin, and we both had an obnoxious We Know A Secret Look for simply hours, which pissed Grandma right off.\n\nShe told her fianc\u00e9 what was up and he went and started talking about guy stuff with my husband and sure enough, once Grandma started getting annoying and scapegoating Mom to the aunts, being obnoxious with Cousin about wedding plans and so when will there be baaaybeees...\n\nCousin looked at me, I nodded, and Cousin broke the news.\n\nGrandma looked stunned. Hurt. Like she, Rightful Center of All Attention, was the last to know?! How? Why? Unfair?!\n\nThe aunts and Mom were thrilled. Such rejoicing! A bride AND a flower girl or a ring bearer! Such news! And what cousins, to love one another so, that their joys are shared! The husbands (well, Jerry wasn't then, but he is now, so close enough,) had snuck out and gotten fancy sparkly apple juice, so there was toasting with stuff I could have, and the whole party got awesomer. Cousin set all sorts of boundaries with me being pregnant as the excuse and it was just a tea fountain altogether. \"I don't want a big, boozy hen party like Mary Clarissa and Mary Maureen had. I want something sensible and peaceful, so I can have my little new cousin there, and half my bridesmaids are in AA, so seriously, I need yinz to be chill. Could we maybe go to [drive-in we loved as kids] after [candy place]? That would be really cool.\" \"Yeah, I know it's a tradition, but it's a crummy one. Aunt Ladybird had to sit out HOW many weddings because of it? I want Spidey for my matron of honor and *she's* pregnant, so my bridesmaids can wear whatever the hell fits them so long as it's gray so they can wear it again sometime. And I'll use *silk* flowers to make 'em match, thank you *very* much, because I remember Aunt Mantis' wedding and everyone with a rose allergy being drugged off their nipples on Benedryl. Poor Aunt Ladybird was hitting the inhaler almost as hard as Uncle Grasshopper hit the bong yinz pretend not to know about.\"\n\nGrandma looked like there was cat shit in her Cheerios.\n\nIt was frickin' awesome.\n\nCousin just recently let it be known at the family Christmas do that she's expecting her second. She got my daughter to make the announcement for her, and you've never seen such a boundary-enforcing, protective little bloodhound as an eight-year-old girl who has seen every episode of 'Call The Midwife' at least five times and thinks her mom's cousin whom she calls Auntie hung the moon. The phrase \"I don't think we need to hire a doula this time,\" came into the conversation from Uncle Jerry, and I am not a hundred percent sure he wasn't serious.\n\nSo families can, indeed, be Like This.\n\nNTA.", "After having 2 bio kids, wife and I adopted a 3rd kid.

But I didn\u2019t read the OG thread. People have weird about grief I agree.

We\u2019ve moved into this very partisan mindset of Team A or Team B, with no other options.

I say, first send personal text messages to everyone who is not your cousin or her immediate family.

Almost everyone announces it the day of that I have ever known!

Plus, I personally hate being the center of attention, so it is a foreign concept to me that someone would want a whole day/week/whatever to be all about their news. \n\nSo it's good to read these AITA posts to understand social norms that might not be obvious.\n\nMeanwhile if I get married, I will be trying to conceptualize how to make myself less the center of attention.

Maybe OP knows and understands that, as evidenced by the fact that she apologized to her cousin. \n\nMaybe people here need to stop quibbling and finding weird bullshit issues that require pretzel logic and get comfortable with the idea that it's OK to hold people accountable. I mean, honestly, exactly what hill are you dying on with these responses? What underlying point are you trying to make here? That OP's behavior was acceptable? If you think that, I highly encourage you to put that idea to the test. Go find someone who is sharing news, and immediately share some of your own. See what happens.
