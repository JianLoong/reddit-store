My family rarely chat in the group unless there is a big life event happening or we are organsing a family event. Earlier this year, one of my aunties asked if anyone had any life updates to share. My cousin (F30) had a particularly big life update and annouced she got engaged to her partner of 7 years first.  All the family including myself congratulated her and I was genuinely very happy. I didn't think too much of it at the time but I thought since we were going around sharing our life updates, I thought it would only be fitting to announce my pregnancy in the group chat as well. All my family congratulated me as well and everyone seemed really excited about my baby news including my cousin. \n\nA couple of days later, my cousin messages a long paragraph absolutely furious. She accused me of stealing her spotlight announcing my pregnancy on the same day as her engagement, although she seemed happy for me in the group chat the day before. I immediately apologised to her and felt so guilty after the fact. My cousin never messages me back after my apology and I didn't talk to her again for the rest of my pregnancy. \n\nI feel really sad about all this as its now formed a wedge between my mum and my aunty as they have taken sides. To top it all off several months later, my beautiful baby daughter was born on the same day as my cousin's birthday (co-incidence right?). I have very recently given birth to a beautiful daughter and I wanted to make a baby announcement on the day she was born. However I could not bring myself to do it because my cousin just turned 30 which is a huge milestone. I am already not on speaking terms with my cousin and her family just over this and don't want to steal my cousin's spotlight a second time.

Mother/daughter or aunt/niece? Is there any chance that your aunt's question was a setup or a prompt, planned for your cousin to announce her engagement? Or is it just pure coincidence that your aunt asked the question just as she got engaged?", "I'm going to say NTA, your aunt asked and you both responded. It's not like she out of the blue announced it and you announced your pregnancy as well at that time. I would have just messaged people individually on the birth announcement, but even if you did it in the group chat wouldn't have mattered, which 30 yo makes a big deal about their birthday?", "NTA at all. Why on Earth is your cousins engagement more significant than your pregnancy?  And even if it was bad form to announce your pregnancy right after she announced the engagement, you apologized as soon as you learned that it hurt her. And she didn't talk to you for the rest of your pregnancy. What is that? Announce the birth of your child. Starting a life is as significant as living one for 30 years. You have every right to celebrate your life, please don't let your aunt or your cousin make you believe that you're less important than she is", "NTA look I get it your cousin wants to have her moment but it\u2019s not like you announced it at her wedding. Her reaction afterwards to you however and the rift she has caused by overreacting makes her TA. You were asked for big news and you shared your news, yes you could have waited but why would you need to. If you had announced your pregnancy first would she have not announced her engagement?", "I don't understand the Y T A. Yes, she announced it after her cousin, BUT would the cousin have announced it then, if the aunt hadn't asked for life updates? \n\nIn my opinion, the fact that, as it seems, this all came after the aunts question, absolves OP.", "NTA. Family asked if anyone had news to share. Anyone. Not specifically just your cousin. Also, you can\u2019t help when your baby was born. Your cousin is one of thousands of people with that same birthday. Celebrate your kid on her actual birthday. Your cousin is ridiculous. Main Character Syndrome. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA because if she wanted to make this announcement previously she could have, I'm assuming. Nothing stopped her from texting pictures and updates on the engagement to everyone the day it happened. \n\nIf she had messaged everything (without being asked) and then you announced that day you were pregnant I'd think that would be thoughtless, but in this context I feel like she overreacted.", "INFO: how long had your cousin been engaged when this happened? \n\nIf this was her first opportunity to announce it to the family, then I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole but I can understand her being frustrated. It was one of those things where you overstepped a social norm a bit, and people are allowed to feel some type of way about it, but it\u2019s not like you did anything terrible. \n\nBut if she just hadn\u2019t bothered to tell the family until someone happened to ask for updates, then it seems odd to me that she\u2019d accuse anyone of \u201cstealing the spotlight\u201d, bc she intentionally chose to tell the family at a time when multiple people would be sharing news? Like sure, she probably didn\u2019t expect anyone else to have an update as big as hers, but did she just expect no one else to answer your aunt\u2019s question? \n\nUnless there\u2019s some long-standing pattern of disrespect this is the sort of thing that I genuinely don\u2019t understand anyone making a fuss about", "NTA and the whole idea that a single message in a group chat automatically means no one can say anything interesting for a week is completely insane. You both had announcements, so you both announced them. It's not like people can't pay attention to two things at once. Are you supposed to remember everything everyone has announced? For how long? And in a group chat of all things! This is an insane thing for someone to get angry about, and the whole idea of 'someone's day' or 'someone's moment' is ridiculous. Two people can have moments!", "NTA. I swear people are ridiculous. Get over it. These are happy things to be embraced and ppl are acting like children over it. The Aunt asked they responded. Move on. She delayed announcing her child's birth for Christ sakes because these ppl are too sensitive. Just imagine how annoying they will be cause her kids birthday is the same as her cousins. \nSure you want to feel special. I get it. But people in your life don't break or crumble if you give them one good thing to be excited about and another on top of it. Like? WTF. Y'all need to move on. Because it's ridiculous. Waaah you ruined my engagement announcement with your baby news how will I ever get over it? Well idk Fran your about to have a bridal shower, a bachelorette party and a whole freaking wedding that will be all about you. I'm sure you will make it. Time to move on. Celebrate your new baby. You did nothing wrong. Now if no one asked you and your cousin announced it at a dinner and you just stood up immediately and said you were knocked up..than you be s huge AH. Good luck out there", "Okay, so. I guess it's American thing, about announcing stuff, but to me it's absolutely baffling. \"Stole her spotlight\" ? Seriously?\nIt's fucking race or what?\nUsually when someone tells about their life event no one gives absolute shit about it honestly. \nIt's sounds extremely immature of her to expect that her life events that important to other people, especially extended family.\nThere were no spotlight in the first place.\nNTA.", "NTA your aunt asked and you answered. Tbh it sounds like your aunt and cousin were in collusion to make a big deal over your cousin and it backfired!", "NTA, what spotlight are they talking about anyways? The mandatory congratulation and \"do you allready have a date for the wedding/child\" ?\nThe really interested people will text directly anyways, and I'm sure the can text both your cousin and you.", "NTA. You were asked about life updates. Why was only one person allowed to share theirs?", "NTA. They asked for news, they got news. Why can\u2019t good things happen to two people in the family?", "NTA. Jfc why can\u2018t two people in the same family have exciting, happy things happening in their lives and share their happiness and why does and why does someone need \u201ethe spotlight\u201c for getting engaged. Don\u2018t you get engaged and married for you and your partner?", "NTA, but was the aunt who asked your cousin's mother? If so, I bet the question was specifically directed to her making her engagement announcement, and you unwittingly stepped into their grand plan. But that's what they get for setting it up that way, and you genuinely answered her question. It's not like Auntie said, \"Hey, Cousin, why don't you share your news?\" She is the one who asked an open question, and your response to her question by sharing your good news was entirely appropriate.\n\nHonestly, they sound exhausting. You can't send a baby announcement because your cousin is 30? Stop worrying about offending these people. They'll be offended anyhow.\n\n(Edit to correct typo)", "NTA. \n\nIt was a group chat, the question was directed at everybody. Both of you had news and got to tell it. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s also an US thing, but making a pregnancy or engagement announcement a \u201ething\u201c always seems quite overblown to me. It happens, it\u2019s nice, but do you really need a stage and applause for this?", "NTA\u2014 ok, maybe you made a mistake, but that they\u2019ve dragged the whole family into it and are still making you feel badly about it many months and an apology later makes your cousin and aunt the AHs here.", "Honestly do engagements even matter? My sis has been engaged for like 6 years, whens that f*ker gonna marry her?\n\nLol sorry, personally I think NTA. Why can't yall just be happy for each other and celebrate both?", "Nta. An engagement announcement pales in comparison to a new life being brought to this Earth. Your aunt asked for updates, so you both shared updates. You should\u2019ve announced the birth in the group chat - any person with a heart would be happy to know they\u2019ve got a healthy new little one in the fam. Cousin is already a bridezilla.", "Obviously NTA", "Unfortunately YTA. You could have waited a week to announce - it\u2019s a group chat not a phone call.", "yeah I mean YTA but if you legitimately just weren't thinking of the implications then well. ok you were a bit airheaded it happens. I would maybe be slightly upset but pretty quickly forgive you if I was cousin.   \n\n\nAs for childs birth on the same day that unlike the pregnancy announcement is not something you are in control of. Birthday is the same day announce away.", "YTA. You could\u2019ve waited like a DAY?", "YTA but it's clear you didn't mean to be \n\nLife updates = not necessarily big news (e.g. how work is going, general chitchat about things), they were probably trying to prompt the group chat to have a conversation\n\nYour cousin was probably thinking about how to announce and took that opportunity to tell everyone\n\nYou should have allowed her to have at least a couple of days of celebrating this big moment in her life. You announcing your pregnancy moments later makes it look like \"ooo me too!\" And diverts the attention away which your cousin deserved.\n\nIf you're close, spend some time making a fuss over her and asking her about the proposal/wedding", "[deleted]", "YTA.

It could have waited a day. Lesson learned, next time let her have her moment and give it a day or two before having yours.\n\nHowever, NTA re announcing your child's birth. Do it! This shouldn't wait a day.", "NTA but you should start to be one by passive aggressively running every single announcement through her first.", "Of course YTA", "NTA. It was an open question for anyone to answer. If your cousin was really eager to announce her engagement she would've done so without being prompted.", "YTA.

Like sorry, but you cant opening ask for updates to EVERYONE then be pissed everyone has things. Guess what, big families have multiple events that are all important to them.

You were asked if something was going on in your life. You just answered the question. I'm always amazed by how people today are so starved for attention!

And then to think if OP had announced her pregnancy first the cousin would have been the one \u2018announcing her engagement on the same day as OP announced her baby\u2019. I don\u2019t think the cousin would have withheld that information.

NTA. If it was important to the cousin, why did she wait for a prompt? Unless she was proposed to 5 seconds before the group chat question, she totally could've just gone ahead and announced it when it happened. \nAs for the baby announcement, that in my book would always top a birthday. I'm sure the cousin would be annoyed, but it's not like this was OP's evil plan... Not to mention, someone - a 30 year old adult - who is cutting ties, holding a by now several months long grudge and splitting up a family over something so trivial and ridiculous as someone else having happy news when she does, is not deserving of much consideration in my book. \nI wouldn't announe any such news at someone's wedding/engagement party/birtday party, but other than that it's all fair game. To me it's really self absorbed to want to milk any attention for days over my personal news. I can also expect my loved ones to have the ability to be happy for two people at the same time.", "Neither is more significant. It\u2019s just the timing. OP could\u2019ve waited a day.", "You made a Great point which I agree with", "Space out the Y T A or the bot will count it", "I am an American and I agree with you. I can't say it isn't a thing because this is not the only time I have seen people upset about things like this and it is always non-events like engagements that are not an accomplishment at all and never things like graduations that actually are a big deal.", "It does sound like that. They sound exhausting.", "The intimated family group chat isn\u2019t really a stage with applause is it?", "Cultural things I guess, but here in France, or maybe only where I live, you get straight up to marriage, you don't go through engagements.", "I think your sister is more of an outlier.

It is just a new phase in an existing relationship that is still easily severed.\n\nEven weirder is when people say they are going to get engaged and then plan the engagement like it is an actual wedding. \n\nAnyway, it wasn't a formal announcement of the engagement or whatever. It was telling people something that already happened.

They were genuinely happy, just ok, let's have wine and move on.\n\nParties are fine if you want to have a party. People enjoy celebrating things. People celebrate when a person ages up. It doesn't mean they actually care about the actual birthday. They care about the person and like celebrating things.\n\nThis wasn't a party. This was a group chat. Imagine someone getting mad that someone announced that they had a birthday a week previously then got mad someone announced that they were pregnant the same day. No one would be saying to let the week past the birthday boy have his spotlight.
