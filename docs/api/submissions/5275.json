My family rarely chat in the group unless there is a big life event happening or we are organsing a family event. Earlier this year, one of my aunties asked if anyone had any life updates to share. My cousin (F30) had a particularly big life update and annouced she got engaged to her partner of 7 years first.  All the family including myself congratulated her and I was genuinely very happy. I didn't think too much of it at the time but I thought since we were going around sharing our life updates, I thought it would only be fitting to announce my pregnancy in the group chat as well. All my family congratulated me as well and everyone seemed really excited about my baby news including my cousin. \n\nA couple of days later, my cousin messages a long paragraph absolutely furious. She accused me of stealing her spotlight announcing my pregnancy on the same day as her engagement, although she seemed happy for me in the group chat the day before. I immediately apologised to her and felt so guilty after the fact. My cousin never messages me back after my apology and I didn't talk to her again for the rest of my pregnancy. \n\nI feel really sad about all this as its now formed a wedge between my mum and my aunty as they have taken sides. To top it all off several months later, my beautiful baby daughter was born on the same day as my cousin's birthday (co-incidence right?). I have very recently given birth to a beautiful daughter and I wanted to make a baby announcement on the day she was born. However I could not bring myself to do it because my cousin just turned 30 which is a huge milestone.

Mother/daughter or aunt/niece? Is there any chance that your aunt's question was a setup or a prompt, planned for your cousin to announce her engagement?

It's not like she out of the blue announced it and you announced your pregnancy as well at that time. I would have just messaged people individually on the birth announcement, but even if you did it in the group chat wouldn't have mattered, which 30 yo makes a big deal about their birthday?", "NTA at all. Why on Earth is your cousins engagement more significant than your pregnancy?  And even if it was bad form to announce your pregnancy right after she announced the engagement, you apologized as soon as you learned that it hurt her. And she didn't talk to you for the rest of your pregnancy. What is that? Announce the birth of your child. Starting a life is as significant as living one for 30 years. You have every right to celebrate your life, please don't let your aunt or your cousin make you believe that you're less important than she is", "NTA look I get it your cousin wants to have her moment but it\u2019s not like you announced it at her wedding. Her reaction afterwards to you however and the rift she has caused by overreacting makes her TA. You were asked for big news and you shared your news, yes you could have waited but why would you need to. If you had announced your pregnancy first would she have not announced her engagement?", "I don't understand the Y T A. Yes, she announced it after her cousin, BUT would the cousin have announced it then, if the aunt hadn't asked for life updates? \n\nIn my opinion, the fact that, as it seems, this all came after the aunts question, absolves OP.", "NTA. Family asked if anyone had news to share. Anyone. Not specifically just your cousin. Also, you can\u2019t help when your baby was born. Your cousin is one of thousands of people with that same birthday. Celebrate your kid on her actual birthday. Your cousin is ridiculous. Main Character Syndrome. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA because if she wanted to make this announcement previously she could have, I'm assuming.

It was one of those things where you overstepped a social norm a bit, and people are allowed to feel some type of way about it, but it\u2019s not like you did anything terrible. \n\nBut if she just hadn\u2019t bothered to tell the family until someone happened to ask for updates, then it seems odd to me that she\u2019d accuse anyone of \u201cstealing the spotlight\u201d, bc she intentionally chose to tell the family at a time when multiple people would be sharing news? Like sure, she probably didn\u2019t expect anyone else to have an update as big as hers, but did she just expect no one else to answer your aunt\u2019s question? \n\nUnless there\u2019s some long-standing pattern of disrespect this is the sort of thing that I genuinely don\u2019t understand anyone making a fuss about", "NTA and the whole idea that a single message in a group chat automatically means no one can say anything interesting for a week is completely insane. You both had announcements, so you both announced them. It's not like people can't pay attention to two things at once. Are you supposed to remember everything everyone has announced? For how long? And in a group chat of all things! This is an insane thing for someone to get angry about, and the whole idea of 'someone's day' or 'someone's moment' is ridiculous. Two people can have moments!", "NTA. I swear people are ridiculous. Get over it. These are happy things to be embraced and ppl are acting like children over it. The Aunt asked they responded. Move on. She delayed announcing her child's birth for Christ sakes because these ppl are too sensitive. Just imagine how annoying they will be cause her kids birthday is the same as her cousins. \nSure you want to feel special. I get it. But people in your life don't break or crumble if you give them one good thing to be excited about and another on top of it. Like? WTF. Y'all need to move on. Because it's ridiculous.

Well idk Fran your about to have a bridal shower, a bachelorette party and a whole freaking wedding that will be all about you. I'm sure you will make it. Time to move on. Celebrate your new baby.

Good luck out there", "Okay, so. I guess it's American thing, about announcing stuff, but to me it's absolutely baffling. \"Stole her spotlight\" ?

You were asked about life updates. Why was only one person allowed to share theirs?", "NTA. They asked for news, they got news. Why can\u2019t good things happen to two people in the family?", "NTA. Jfc why can\u2018t two people in the same family have exciting, happy things happening in their lives and share their happiness and why does and why does someone need \u201ethe spotlight\u201c for getting engaged. Don\u2018t you get engaged and married for you and your partner?", "NTA, but was the aunt who asked your cousin's mother? If so, I bet the question was specifically directed to her making her engagement announcement, and you unwittingly stepped into their grand plan. But that's what they get for setting it up that way, and you genuinely answered her question. It's not like Auntie said, \"Hey, Cousin, why don't you share your news?\" She is the one who asked an open question, and your response to her question by sharing your good news was entirely appropriate.\n\nHonestly, they sound exhausting. You can't send a baby announcement because your cousin is 30? Stop worrying about offending these people. They'll be offended anyhow.\n\n(Edit to correct typo)", "NTA. \n\nIt was a group chat, the question was directed at everybody. Both of you had news and got to tell it. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s also an US thing, but making a pregnancy or engagement announcement a \u201ething\u201c always seems quite overblown to me.

An engagement announcement pales in comparison to a new life being brought to this Earth. Your aunt asked for updates, so you both shared updates.

Why are you letting her insecurities take over your relationship with the rest of the family. Your daughters birthdate is a fact. Big deal she is 30 how is the family wishing you well going to detract from her birthday.\n\nIf she wants to get offended let her. Also your daughter is more important than a cousin. A child's birthday is more important. Dont hide her from her families love and attention because of a spoilt person.\n\nAlso within family - the more good news the better. There shouldnt be jealousy.", "NTA! Congratulations on your baby girl. You deserve to share whatever you'd like, whenever, especially such a huge milestone for you!

I'll go against the grain here and say it, yeah YTA.\n\nWould it have killed you to wait one or two more days to announce your pregnancy? No. \n\nI get the idea that you stealing the limelight from your cousin may not be a first time occurrence and announcing a pregnancy *just after* someone else announced an engagement is a social faux pas.\n\nIts also very normal to wait a few days after birth before announcing it to extended family.

It.sounds like you over-apologized and your cousin has a victim mentality.", "YUP. YTA.  She shared her happiness and you were so uncaring about this major life event that you had to Bogart it.  Yours could have easily waited. Even just 24 hours. Your default position was yourself.

Why can't two happy events be on the same day?  Why are people so obsessed with being in the spotlight by themselves that they can't be happy for someone else at the same time?  I don't understand that at all.  It seems very narcissistic to me.", "Hold.on, Ima let you finish, but first...", "I actually think the cousin is TA because OP has apologised.

If so, it was probably a coordinated set up for the cousin to announce. \n\nIf OP hadn\u2019t thought to update everyone until then, waiting a few days or weeks wouldn\u2019t have hurt anyone.

My first thought was that it sounds like a setup. And if aunt and cousin pre-planned the exchange, I can see why cousin was thinking of it as \"her time\" to share her news and why she sees OP as butting in on her announcement. I don't agree, but I could see where she's coming from. Like the other commenter said, definitely poorly executed if so.", "And being pregnant is also not a general life update, it is a big announcement as well.", "Next time.  LOL", "It was a set up. The aunt posted what she did to create that opening for the cousin to make her announcement. In their minds, only their news was important and to be shared.\n\nOP didn't do anything wrong - the aunt and cousin are just unwilling to share the spotlight and didn't even fathom that there would be other important news to share.\n\nThe family chat should be made smaller with just siblings and parents.", ">In my country, Italy, the concept of \u201cstealing the spotlight\u201d is not even a thing, you can be happy for two people.

When I announced my engagement last year, my family said we'd celebrate the next week at my grandparents (we see each other most weeks). That day my cousin announced she was pregnant with her third child and my uncle announced he's made partner at the firm he works at. We just celebrated all three announcement everyone was happy about all three things.", "As an American-- it's something I have only experienced on reddit, and never in real life.

I didn\u2019t think of it that way", "Yea well. Then they shouldn't have asked a general question to the entire family in the group chat. Should have said something like \"Cousin, donyou have anything new going on?\"", "Then that also answers the question of whether that family is unnecessarily dramatic, passive aggressive, fake, and attention seeking. They either need to just make the announcement or organize an event.", "Oh wow, that's really wow. I'm in my 30s, I genuinely don't know anyone who made a big deal about their 30th birthday.

That's why I want to know the relationship \u2013 I can see a mother setting this up for her daughter, but not an aunt for a niece. And if it is mother/daughter then I think it's pretty obtuse of OP to not realise that it was a setup.\n\nIt strikes me as very odd that someone who'd get her knickers in a twist over having her spotlight stolen would wait to be asked before stepping into that spotlight.

I have some family like this & it\u2019s exhausting.

I don\u2019t think my brother and his wife would have been upset if people at the wedding were told, but we wanted to let them have that day.", "Oh thats an odd system, well this one was fairly high when I saw it", "It is a milestone and to the people in the relationship, yeah, it can feel important. \n\nIt is not the kind of milestone that deserves special consideration in a group chat. Neither is pregnancy.\n\nFor formal announcements or parties, sure, have the spotlight.", "Where does it say that the cousin\u2019s mother was the one who asked? \n\nOP wrote, *\u201done of my aunties asked\u2026\u201d*\n\nThat means she has more than one aunt in the group chat.", ">Yeah because that was a set up by the cousins mother, i.e. OPs auntie.\n\nOK, and? They still used an open ended question to a large group of people. All OP did was answer the question after the cousin had their \"moment\".", "Exactly \ud83d\ude0c", "Lol many men love drama as well and many women don't. Speaking in absolutes is silly. For example you are literally causing drama right now for attention but are a man. But the fact you say females already speaks volumes about what type of person you are.", "I have a second cousin born on my birthday. I make it a point to text her mom (my cousin) \"say happy birthday to the birth-day stealing brat \ud83d\ude06\" The mom knows I'm teasing, as there was no way to really control when she was born lol. Personally, I think it's cool there's someone else in the family that shares a birthday with me \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "As someone who has a side of the family like OPs, I totally see her logic. People will be petty and make her and her child\u2019s life difficult for something so stupid. She\u2019s trying to avoid conflict and navigate this with nuance because in an enmeshed family the rules are different.", "Wow, what's so hard to understand about \"I don't like birthdays, but I would be down for other get togethers\"... Just stupid. Glad on most of these most people agree others are allowed to have boundaries and grief.", "See, that seems fine to me. It's the people who demand that the other child NOT have a party that are undeniably assholes.", "And people jump to some hella amazing conclusions also lol", "My birthday is the day before my dad's - when it comes up he always jokes to my mom that if only she could have waited one more day he would have had a real birthday present! She usually replies with snark \"You try waiting to have a baby when you're in labor!\" \ud83d\ude02", "My nephew was born on my 30th birthday.  I always remember his birthday and I know how old he is.  Win-Win.", "What has that got to do with the discussion? I too have time and disposable income, I still would be happy to have my cousin/friend's child share my birthday.", "Basically. But Reddit sometimes doesn\u2019t understand that because someone is innocent doesn\u2019t make other guilty. The OP was hurt and loved parties and wondered why this person never came to hers and I get that but that really didn\u2019t make the person who lost a baby to misscarriage the bad guy and that day Reddit decided that if one person is innocent the other must be guilty. So I get not knowing if your reasonable comment is going to get hate sometimes.", "That's fine, they can feel however they want.  But then, so can I, no?", "\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude04", "You said people don\u2019t care about their 30th birthday in your part of the world. I posited that maybe it wasn\u2019t regional but circumstantial and that people at different stages in their life had different priorities. I\u2019m confused by your frustration with my comment. You can both really want to celebrate a milestone birthday AND not care that a baby shares it", "Im afraid thats not the AITA way. So you and I will be downvoted.\n\nIf OP really wanted advive they shouldve gone to relationship advice, not here.", ">It\u2019s not so much a contest as it is stealing someone\u2019s moment.\n\nIt wasn't the cousin's moment. It was a general question to a large group of people.", "If you think it can be \"stolen\" then it's because you think it's something that **can** be stolen.  It isn't.", "Glad to know about finding deleted posts cuz sometimes I forget I left it on a post and come back to it being deleted before I finished reading it lol so frustrating. For the comments with more info I just click on the person's name and read it in their comments instead of scrolling.", "Woah you got me! Good one.", "It wasn\u2019t a joke. I\u2019ve never been asked that on Reddit. Reddit is a place where literally everything gets mentioned.", "This could def be more of a cultural difference than a difference of a opinions.", "If I select new or top or anything but the default on my phone I can manually edit the url to old which is a step I'm only willing to take I really want to get to the automod copy of a deleted post because I'm lazy.", "You\u2019re being asked why you thought a completely unrelated \u201cpoint\u201d applied. Come on now.", "I never said anything about not celebrating engagements. I don't even mind celebrating. I am saying it is not an important life event to people outside the relationship. \n\nI am saying that it is silly to get mad that someone said they are pregnant in the same group chat. It would be silly for the pregnant person to be mad as well.\n\nI think it would have been silly should the situation be reversed even though the pregnancy and birth is a much, much bigger deal than a wedding. \n\nWith both people may have mixed feelings while expecting to be supportive. But a wedding is just a legal/religious/cultural bonding with a party attached. It is equivalent to buying a house as far as life milestones.\n\nGrowing a whole ass person, though, (yeah, animals reproduce as well), still doesn't make it any less miraculous even knowing the science.", "I would still think a pregnancy announcement is more exciting than a marriage/wedding but that's just me. Still maintain op is NTA in this case.", "NTA. I\u2019m moving on.", "You are right. NTA.", "I don\u2019t think it matters which one is more important to us bc to the person it\u2019s happening too, it\u2019s the most important thing. Bride should\u2019ve been less petty. I\u2019ll do NTA."]}
