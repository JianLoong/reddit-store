But your update suggests something else in that she planned it, booked flights but didn't bother telling you.  And has only told you after you gave her the mandatory weeks notice that you were going to use her as per your agreement. \n\nIf she was planning on using it in that week you would think that she would've said something to you before you gave her the weeks notice.\n\nIt's your house, so you do have first preference and it sounds like were fulfilling the terms of your agreement in that you let her know a week in advance that you'd be using it.  She's the one that didn't let you know when she was planning to.  And I would wonder whether she'd have told you at all or maybe after the fact.\n\nHow long ago did she book the flights?  A smart person would let the person owning the house know they were going to use it on a particular week if booking more than a week in advance and before flights are booked to make sure there is no clash.\n\nHad it not been for your update I'd be saying Y T A but in this case, it sounds like Sarah is taking advantage of you which actually makes you NTA.  Your family also seem to be enabling Sarah and the whole situation is quite toxic.\n\nAs for the money she owes you, you only ever lend someone money if you are prepared to never see it again and it's a bonus when you do.  So I would never again lend money to any family or friends.  Especially not Sarah and her husband.\n\nYou could initiate legal proceedings to get the money back but what you could do it tell her that even though she's the entitled one, that the cost of their flights that they will lose by not coming will pay off their debt to them and you'll never speak of it again.\n\nYou'll then need to rethink your arrangement regarding the holiday home.  I would at minimum change the locks (if Sarah has a key) and also get security cameras if she turns up and realises the key doesn't work and breaks in!  There will be no more holidays at the house for Sarah.\n\nAs for the family members siding with her, only you can decide whether you want to remain in contact with them.  Perhaps surround yourself with family members that see her for what she is or maybe your husbands family instead.

I feel like you're intentionally obscuring the actual ownership in your post and comments. \n\nYou say it belongs to your family. Is that your nuclear birth family or your married family aka you and your husband? You're a total jerk either way.", "Taking everything at face value, I'm going with NTA, though it would be nice if you could push your trip back a week since she bought plane tickets.\n\nIf you knew she was planning, either from other family or because she's always there the x week of January or because a couple months ago she said she thinks she might want to come on these date, and you planned a trip knowing you may be disrupting her plans then you'd be the A H.", "You can have all the problems you want with her, YTA for knowing for 6 months and then at the last second pulling out.", "YTA. They planned this trip for months and you went at the same time they were supposed to be there out of spite", "Anyone else hoping OP can somehow be found financially liable for her sister's expenses. Hopefully sister has it all in writing and it can form the basis of a binding agreement.\n\nYTA", "YTA, a big one. That was just mean.", "YTA, so much that you surely must be the sister posting as if you were the house owner.", "YTA. Sounds like you did that on purpose to make her lose money. Unsure of the way you think this will help them pay you back sooner.", "YTA If you wanted the money, you needed to speak with them at the 1 year mark & set up a payment plan. If they were not able to at the 1 year mark,  you needed to set up a plan of action based on time to get collection of the money. Why would you allow them at the vacation home? You were already pissed about the money & prior damages they had caused. YTA because you set them up. You were dishonest with them, allowed them to use the vacation home no strings attached, observed them plan for half a year \u2026then 1 week before spring this nonsense on them?? You sound revengeful", "Your actions cost her money.\n\nYou now owe her that money.\n\nShe owes you money, but you owe her money...\n\nSounds like the two cancel each other out and she doesn't owe you any cash anymore.", "YTA for pulling the holiday out from them a week before, knowing full well they had paid for everything to get there. \n\nWhy would you think this would be ok? And why would you expect any money back after you pull this stunt", "Of course YTA! On what planet would you not be  TA for this?!", "THE HOUSE ISNT EVEN YOURS. You\u2019re not just an asshole you\u2019re also a raging lunatic and selfish to boot", "How were you even able to tell your sister no, if it\u2019s not solely your house? Didn\u2019t she have just as much of a right to say no to you coming?", "\u201cMay have come across as selfish\u201d\nNo your actions and attitude are completely wholeheartedly selfish and off putting.\nNo two ways about it.\n\nAlso incredibly entitled considering it\u2019s not even your house.", "She has it planned and paid it for 6 months now. She has priority then. Ef you, you AH.", "It's not the highest voted comment so it won't be counted anyway", "YTA and a liar who can't keep her story straight."]}
