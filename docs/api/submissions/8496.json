But your update suggests something else in that she planned it, booked flights but didn't bother telling you.  And has only told you after you gave her the mandatory weeks notice that you were going to use her as per your agreement. \n\nIf she was planning on using it in that week you would think that she would've said something to you before you gave her the weeks notice.\n\nIt's your house, so you do have first preference and it sounds like were fulfilling the terms of your agreement in that you let her know a week in advance that you'd be using it.  She's the one that didn't let you know when she was planning to.  And I would wonder whether she'd have told you at all or maybe after the fact.\n\nHow long ago did she book the flights?  A smart person would let the person owning the house know they were going to use it on a particular week if booking more than a week in advance and before flights are booked to make sure there is no clash.\n\nHad it not been for your update I'd be saying Y T A but in this case, it sounds like Sarah is taking advantage of you which actually makes you NTA.  Your family also seem to be enabling Sarah and the whole situation is quite toxic.\n\nAs for the money she owes you, you only ever lend someone money if you are prepared to never see it again and it's a bonus when you do.  So I would never again lend money to any family or friends.  Especially not Sarah and her husband.\n\nYou could initiate legal proceedings to get the money back but what you could do it tell her that even though she's the entitled one, that the cost of their flights that they will lose by not coming will pay off their debt to them and you'll never speak of it again.\n\nYou'll then need to rethink your arrangement regarding the holiday home.  I would at minimum change the locks (if Sarah has a key) and also get security cameras if she turns up and realises the key doesn't work and breaks in!  There will be no more holidays at the house for Sarah.\n\nAs for the family members siding with her, only you can decide whether you want to remain in contact with them.  Perhaps surround yourself with family members that see her for what she is or maybe your husbands family instead.
