I don't know what is the best way to prepare for bullying, but it's certainly not to *bully your own child* into accepting gender norms.\n\nYeah you're supposed to co-parent. That means consulting each other on major decisions, like whether you're going to enroll him in summer camp or buy him a car. A single movie or a gift card for him to buy some makeup is not a major decision. Well, it is if you're a gender-essentialist bigot. FFS, you're not letting him transition, you just took him to a movie. And there's no reason you need to let your co-parent know every time you buy him something that is like $20. It's not that serious. She's making it serious because she's a homophobe.\n\nYour house? Your rules. If she doesn't want Michael to go to Barbie and buy makeup, I guess that's her right. It's probably wrong, but whatever. But that doesn't mean she gets a say when your kid is with you.", "NTA For reasons everyone is saying. \n\nForcing kids to suppress parts of themselves because you're scared of bullying will only make them easier targets. It seems like he has friends, that he went to the movies with, and is honest with you about bullying.\n\nIf you suspect otherwise then pay closer attention. If there's a valid concern maybe agree upon some light SM monitoring so you can keep an eye out for any cyber bulling etc. Some teenagers don't have a problem with parental controls if they feel safe if they know the things the controls are truly for their safety and not for parents to snoop and punish them for being a teenager.", "NTA. Kids are more open-minded and respectful of difference than they used to be when you were in school (not that there won't be any bullying issues).

Maybe his stuff that he's more comfortable with should be kept at your place so he has a judgement free zone to explore what he's interested in.
