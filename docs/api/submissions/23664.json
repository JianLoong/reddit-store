A single movie or a gift card for him to buy some makeup is not a major decision. Well, it is if you're a gender-essentialist bigot.

If there's a valid concern maybe agree upon some light SM monitoring so you can keep an eye out for any cyber bulling etc. Some teenagers don't have a problem with parental controls if they feel safe if they know the things the controls are truly for their safety and not for parents to snoop and punish them for being a teenager.", "NTA.

If your family ends up being correct it\u2019s possible he will pull back his behavior while out in the world and that\u2019s a shame, the world will do enough encouraging him to hide his true self without his own family piling on. He needs to know that the people who love him will always love him for exactly who he is and that\u2019s what your are showing him. I keep seeing behavior on here from parents who claim to be worried about they\u2019re kids being bullied and so in order to prevent that they bully their kids first, what kind of logic is that, won\u2019t the bullying hurt worse coming from someone you love", "Nta,\nI'd encourage you to keep a close eye on your ex and Michael and make sure she doesn't start physically abusing him for not conforming, we already can see she's headed towards verbal/mental if she hasn't already crossed into it by not accepting him, fully as is.", "This 100%!

Have you talked to many butch lesbians or trans men about their childhoods?? The idea that they were all allowed to express themselves as they wished and weren't pressured/forced/shamed into being more feminine than they were comfortable with is _fucking ridiculous_", "NTA and I disagree with the comment about a close minded professional world. Maybe I\u2019m biased because I work in a creative industry but nowadays it\u2019s the bigots who don\u2019t fit into corporate culture and are reprimanded and ostracized, not their victims", "NTA.

One of my family members is under 10 and gender non- conforming. If they show an interest in makeup I'll buy them all the Sephora gift cards they can handle. \n\nThe way you're handling this should be a model for fathers everywhere.  \n\nAlso, having worked in corporate offices for many years,  things are so much better than they used to be.

People are pushed into stereotypes all the time - no wonder so many are questioning who they are when they are told they aren't 'masculine' or 'feminine' enough.    Yesterday we had one where the sister got all upset because the female OP didn't want some 'girly' hens night full of cocktails and male strippers - she wanted to go go karting.  I am a woman- i love video games, and building my own computers.  So what?  \n\nIt has to end - your ex wife is homophobic.  She thinks she can 'train' her son to be 'masculine' - well, that isn't going to work.  He clearly likes make up and Barbies.......and you are a great dad.

You're doing parenting right. Daniella on the other hand is bullying her own kid. She's not trying to get him to \"branch out\" into other interests. She's trying to stuff him into the \"BOY\" box.

He's mostly well behaved but a bit socially awkward.

Sounds like he had a great birthday!", "And honestly I wouldn\u2019t worry about the bullying at school (not saying I wouldn\u2019t worry at all just saying I would t worry AS MUCH) as much as I would worry about the bullying he is receiving in his own home from his own family", "NTA.

Keep it up!", "NTA. ur a great parent", "Absolutely NTA. On no issue that I can see are you the asshole. There are a lot of paths forward through life. You can try to force people through a sieve to get a bunch of identical wet noodles but it just isn't going to turn out very good. And, while it isn't a bad idea to encourage your child (any child) to branch out and try lots of things while they're young you can do that without destroying, denigrating, or dismissing who they are.", "Not the asshole. You are his safe space.", "NTA - There is nothing wrong with Daniella wanting Michael to branch out and try other things. But here is the important bit. If Michael doesn't want to then it's non issue. Michael is old enough to know what he's interested in. If that's make up and fashion. That's AWESOME! If its martial arts and sports that's ALSO AWESOME! If he's into video games... guess what AWESOME!\n\nNow as for the bullying. Bullying is not a given. Its not a simple truth of experiences in life. Its something that adults accept because it enforces rules they support or because they are too lazy to do anything about it. \n\nAdditionally even if Michael decides to totally live up to the normal \"boy\" behavior. Bullies will still pick on him. Bully's have a real talent for noticing if a kid doesn't fit even if they are trying their best to fit in. Then on top of being bullied he will be miserable because he wont be pursuing his own interests and living a lie. \n\nIt's better to be yourself and pursue your actual interests despite the bullies than trying to \"fit in.\" \n\nYou seem to be doing it right OP. Good luck and keep it up.", "We agree with this. This is a really sad story. He should be living with you, not her. She is homophobic and honestly dangerous for him.

I hope he does", "> I don't know what is the best way to prepare for bullying, but it's certainly not to bully your own child into accepting gender norms.\n\nIt really depends on circumstances. Ignoring your bullies is something that simply doesn't work. Going to authority might work. My high school came down like a ton of bricks on the one guy that was bullying me. But most of the time the victim gets it worse from the teachers, staff, administration than the bully. Fighting back might work. Zero tolerance means you'll probably get in trouble even if you just curl up on the ground and take a beating so you can force your bully to pay a price for assaulting you. You can get the police involved. Even if it happens in school it is still a crime to attack someone and everyone carries a camera around in their pocket. If we move outside of school into the outside/adult world you may need to carry a firearm for protection.", "Came here for this comment.

His boyfriend comes to the games and cheers with the other boys girlfriends.   Nobody bullies the gays at this school.   At least not for being gay is what my kid tells me anyway. \n\nNot sure if he took any martial arts but they all wrestle like boys do.   Most of them would prefer to not fight him for real.   \n\nI've known that kid going on 10 years.  Always polite.   Respectful.   My son is a grade under him and was shy freshman year.   At a dance he got him out there dancing with some of the girls the soccer Captain was friends with.   \n\nAnyway what I'm getting at is the kid is very popular.   It's not the 90's anymore.", "Yep. I have a friend who's a bi man who was bullied in school, he talked to his parents and they all went to taekwondo lessons together, friend got a black belt and the bullies got the message pretty damn quick after he was able to defend himself. He said after years of bullying it was the only thing that really worked to stop it.", "Excellent idea. I would add gun safety and usage as well. We can try all we want, be as cautious as one can be, and we won't always get to pick and choose the time and circumstances that we need to defend ourselves.

I wish my dad was as accepting as you are of your son.", "NTA, thanks for being a loving and supportive father to your son. He's def going to need it with how his mother acts.

Honestly, sounds like a great dad", "NTA\n\nYou took the kid to a movie he wanted to see with friends. You gave him a giftcard for something he wants to spend it on. That's great.", "By giving him a safe space and encouraging his interests, you are telling him there is nothing wrong with him or his interests, and therefore if he does get bullied, he will have a courage to come and tell you that something wrong is happening with him  because you've taught  him it's wrong. You're NTA. Also in my personal experience kids these days are not really that against men being feminine . Like people don't really care and are generally accepting ( I'm 16 ) and in fact being homophobic is looked down on and is a sure shot way to ensure people will avoid you . I'm from a small town in india tho so this is strictly within my school group and peers and most adults are homophobic .", "NTA. the boy needs at least one parent who understands and loves him for who he is.

Guys wearing makeup isn\u2019t a new or shocking thing although I realize that\u2019s not what a lot of people remember about my generation.\nIt pissed my parents off which helped me double down on questioning \u201csocial norms\u201d. We still had a lot to learn about life and individuality but it was a start; in my friend group anyway. \n\nNot trying to start a generational debate.
