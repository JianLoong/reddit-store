I politely told her that she\u2019s full and if she\u2019s worried about wasting food, it\u2019s fine that\u2019s why I asked for a plastic wrap so she can eat it later, and she always does. \n\nShe said that she had spent a lot of time cooking that meal for my kids just to waste & It is entirely disrespectful and insulting to her so My kid is gonna eat the food. \n\nAgain, I told her she won\u2019t be eating if she\u2019s not hungry and we arent wasting food. It will be saved for later. but eventually she gave up and let it go\n\nWell, my 4 your old has a bag of toys that she swears by bringing with her all the time, so we let her bring it.\n\nSo when we were all relaxing In the dining area, she was on the carpet in the living room, playing with her toys and she made a mess and walked away from it. \n\nOnce again, my mother-in-law came over and apparently  told her to clean it up in or else I would come over there and \u201cwhoop your ass and put you in time out\u201d \n\nI said whoa, we are not gonna be doing that. I reminded my daughter that she has to clean up your toys and we talked about this before and she went to clean it up. I told my mother-in-law that she will not threaten my kids like tha and I asked if she was telling her that she wouldn\u2019t clean it up., but this was the first time that she had addressed her about it. \n\nI said, OK, then we will not be doing that. This escalated and she was pretty much saying that I am going to just let them around here and make messes around her house. \n\nI said that I wasn\u2019t and as soon as I was made aware I Addressed it, but she won\u2019t try to scare my kids like that. \n\nThis escalated even more with me telling her to just come get me  and her  screaming in my face telling me that if I was just going to let my spoiled brats walk around here make messes selfishly around her house, then she was gonna do what she saw fit to \u201cmy\u201d kids.

Maybe you need to spend some time with the MIL and explain exactly what you do and why. If she has any objections then you're free to not take the kids to hers anymore. She has her ways, you have yours", "I'm going to say NTA.  It sounds like you have a different parenting style then she did raising her child(ren), and that's fine but she needs to respect your parenting.  Also, does she actually like your children (her grandchildren)?", "NTA. Your kids sound very well behaved and you sound like a very engaged and thoughtful parent. MIL is controlling and mean. I wouldn\u2019t want to be around her and I certainly wouldn\u2019t want my kids around her.", "NTA, you're entitled to your own parenting style and if MIL won't respect that she shouldn't be surprised if you don't come around anymore", "NTA - it sounds like you were as reasonable and patient with your MIL acting like a spoiled child as your with your own kids, who at least respond well to your style.", "NTA\n\nYour MIL is not the parent, she got to parent her children as she wanted , she doesn\u2019t get to decide this for you.\n\nKeep your kids on check? What shove food down their mouth? Berate them for being 4 and 6 and have a short term attention\u2026.appropriate for their age.\n\nGood for you your protecting them.", "NTA.  You are the parents, simple as that.", "NTA. Won't be any baby sitting or overnight visits. Mom's house mom's rules. Guess she's coming to visit at your house. If at all.", "NTA. She threatened your kids with physical violence over a few toys (I assume this wasn't 1000 Legos in a big bag) and contradicted you multiple times.  Then, the screaming at you was completely uncalled for.  Sounds like no more visits at your MIL's house, she's not mentally equipped to handle small children.", "NTA - I could see if she had repeatedly told your kid to clean up and they weren't, but this doesn't seem to be the case. I think your MIL was already pissed off because you undermined her about the dinner situation and then this happened so it gave her an excuse. \n\nI would also let her know that she would no longer worry about my \"brat\" children being in her home. If she ever wants to be in the same room with them she can come to your house.", "NTA. And in the event you ever are willing to bring your kids around her again, you leave the minute she starts trying to override you as the parents.", "So she threatened your 4 year old child & said she was going to beat her for making a mess of toys? Yea you're not the ah here. Your husband needs to understand this is not acceptable behavior nor are your children safe under mils care. Don't ever go back & certainly never leave your children unattended in her presence. Your mil is a psycho. Nta", "Your kids weren\u2019t doing a thing wrong. Kids make a mess, they\u2019re kids. As soon as you knew you told her to clean up and she did. You mil was waaaay out of line. I would have taken my kids and left too, but I also wouldn\u2019t be bringing them back there either. Your mil is going to be the granny that your kids want nothing to do with.", "NTA - This is a very old quote that has some wisdom for this situation.\n\n\u201cDo not raise your children the way your parents raised you; they were born for a different time.\u201d - Ali Bin Abi Thalib (599\u2014661 A.D.)\n\nYou are attempting to break a cycle and give your children a different way than you were raised.  Talk to MIL about these differences and setup boundaries.", "Not the asshole. You would have been the asshole if you *didn\u2019t* immediately leave the situation and allowed your children to be subjected to further verbal and perhaps physical abuse. This grandparent is abusive. Your main priority as a parent needs to be standing up for your child\u2019s rights and dignity. You would be the asshole if you didn\u2019t defend your children and their bodily autonomy and protect them from unhinged, ageist, abusive adults in their extended family. \n\nI\u2019ll add three more things. Make sure your children know that the way their grandmother talked to them was unacceptable and to always tell you if an adult talks to them or treats them in that way. The children need to know you have their backs, that that was not acceptable behavior towards them, and that they did nothing wrong. None of this is their fault. No fallout from this is their fault. They need to hear that message loud and clear from you. \n\nSecondly, you need to keep your children away from this individual going forward. She is dangerous to them and their well-being. You have to protect your family. I don\u2019t care if your children are related to this person. This is all very serious. Threatening to batter your children for normal childhood behavior is atrocious. You would be wise never to speak to these people or allow them around your children again. That would in no way be an overreaction. It would be the reasonable reaction to outrageous and abusive conduct.\n\nThirdly, talk to your husband about all of this. If he was raised in this family, he may have some warped views about what is and is not normal versus abusive. He needs to have his children\u2019s backs and your back. I don\u2019t know who is telling you that you should have stayed and \u201ckept your kids in check\u201d; if it\u2019s your in-laws they have already shown that their opinions are worthless. If it is your husband, that\u2019s a serious problem. Your children\u2019s rights, dignity, boundaries, and needs must always come before the sensitivities of abusive adults, including those in the family. Your parenting practices are completely normal and appropriate as you described them here. Your mother-in-law sounds completely unhinged and possibly dangerous. If you don\u2019t protect your children from this person, they will face a lifetime of emotional and perhaps even physical abuse from them. It will get worse. And you\u2019ll be enabling it if you don\u2019t put a stop to it. The issues may change between toddlers and teenagers but the fundamental dynamic will not. Draw a line in the sand now. People who are dangerous towards your children don\u2019t need to be in their lives. \n\nFinally, even if for some reason your children find themselves around these people again at some point in time (and you should do everything in your power to keep that from happening but I realize family events like funerals or weddings or whatever may come up), never leave them alone with these grandparents under any circumstances. Not even for a moment. Your impulses in the moment handling your mother-in-law\u2019s deranged outbursts sound absolutely correct. Stand your ground. This is not making it about you. Make this 100% about your children and your duty as a parent to protect them from harm. Be the zealous advocate for them that it is your job to be.", "First of all your husband should've put his mother in her place from the jump.

Grandma needs to relax & be grandma instead of the warden . Wasting food? That\u2019s not the reason , overbearing is the reason . I would have left too .", "NTA. You sound like a great parent.\n\nSomething to keep in mind, though: Your child \"had a few bites at dinner, but told me that she was full.\" Unless she's been snacking before dinner, that's probably a lie and lying should be addressed as a separate issue.", "I wouldn't even give them a chance to apologize. If somebody threatened my kids with physical violence, you'd have to drag me out of the house.", "Everyone is well aware he was but she was yelling over everyone", "Yes, he was but his mother was yelling over everyone and he is, he\u2019s not the people telling me I was wrong he left with me.", "The first part is a bit mixed - MIL has the right to say \"everyone stays at the table\" if those are her house rules, but she doesn't have the right to force the child to eat the food. Not wanting the toys left lying around is fair, but the moment a threat of violence comes up, it's game over.", "No he tried stepping in to but she was yelling over him.", "My kids did the same thing as toddlers. They're absolutely starving, eat a few bites, they're full. An hour later, hungry again and finish the meal. I learned to just plate very small portions.", "So an unhinged adult threatens to batter tiny children over nothing and the issue you\u2019re concerned with is that the children politely ate as much as they wanted to eat at the moment and then declined to eat more?", "Why would she lie? What a horrible thing to assume about a child. A kid says they aren't hungry at dinner and you automatically go to \"they must be lying or snacking?\"\n\nLike, you want the mom to accuse her child of lying about her own appetite?", "Have your kids never nibbled a little bit at dinner? Have *you* never had a bite or two at dinner and decided you weren\u2019t so hungry? \n\nI\u2019m not sure why you think a child not being super hungry is a lie to you.", "Wow. Sounds like you're a member of the clean plate club. You realize that leads to eating disorders and unhealthy eating?\n\nChildren often do not eat a full meal, especially at a gathering with excitement. You can't treat them like they are miniature adults, not that anyone would force another adult to eat more than they want.", "Something else to keep in mind is that everyone has a routine and a circadian rhythm, even children.  If a \"family gathering\" dinner is earlier than a child's normal dinner time, they won't be hungry yet.  Mom is doing the responsible thing by not forcing kid to eat until she's hungry.", "That's good. I think the best plan of action is to leave silently and immediately if your mil ever pulls that ish again. Also of course, never leave your kids alone with her, since you now know she will abuse them.\n\nIf I was in your place, I wouldn't gather in her house again. If you host, you will have control.

He left with me he didn\u2019t have an issue with that", "NTA. You handled your children just fine.
