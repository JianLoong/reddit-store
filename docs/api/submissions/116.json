For example, every year for Halloween one of us takes the kids trick or treating while the other chills out at home and then when we get back the home parent is on duty and the trick or treating parent gets a break.\n\nLast year my wife took the kids trick or treating, so this year I did. It was pretty tiring. The five year old got tired and wanted to be carried, while the nine year old kept running ahead and needing to be chased. When I got home I was ready to take a shower and lay in bed reading my book. My legs hurt and I felt old AF.\n\nMy wife came in our room and said the boys were fighting and asked if I could talk to our nine year old while she deals with our younger boy. I said I needed a break before bedtime started (because that's a two person job). She said she needed my help. I said it was her turn. She said it wouldn't take long. I said I was tired.\n\nShe got mad and said \"go to sleep then.\" She shut the light out as she walked out even though she knew I was reading. She didn't talk to me the whole time we were getting the kids ready for bed. After, I told her it felt unfair that I never disturb her off duty time but she always wants to tag me in for emergencies that aren't emergencies. Light arguing (that wasn't even loud enough to carry down the hall) isn't a huge deal.\n\nShe said a parent is never off duty, but she got to be off duty for two hours while I was out with the kids. She said if I called her to come help, she would have, but I wouldn't have because I respect her down time and know she needs breaks from the kids. She said our kids are the most important, and our son needed his father to talk to him, and that's more important than a break.

You also should not have to chase 9 year-old around..?", "Yta being a parent is a 24/7 Job there is no breaks until your child goes to bed. You should share responsibility for the kids not this bs shifts like your working a job you aren't.", "YTA.  If she says she needs help, then she needs help.  All you've done is show her that she can't rely on you if you have decided you're \"off duty\" and shown your kids what mom thinks is important isn't really important because dad didn't get involved when she asked.", "Tbh it\u2019s kinda yta because if it was an actual legitimate talk with your kid it wouldn\u2019t take much effort to share a few words however if your wife means full blown get up and sort the other kid out then NTA because you have had a long day and it would be nice for her to take this one", "INFO: what is the work situation like in your home?

He's taking two steps for every one of yours. Maybe next year it would be easier taking a wagon along. \n\nYour 9 year old running off sounds exhausting. I guess I am just an old mean adult, but I would have been scared of not being able to catch up with him. I would have given a warning and if he didn't stop, would then have taken him home. He could survive losing out on candy far better than I could survive frantically chasing him while carrying his brother.", "Your kids might behave better if you did things as a family instead of one parent being responsible and the other parent taking a break.\nThat makes it look like you don\u2019t want to spend time w your kids.\nIs that true?", "NTA. My husband and I do this with our daughter. She was a really bad sleeper at first and the sleep deprivation was so so hard to deal with. Trading off was the only way we survived and now 6 years later it's nice because, while one parent gets a break, the other parent gets one-on-one time with the kid. However, it only works if you stick to the agreement. Your wife is being unfair, and was childish and disrespectful to turn off the light on you.\n\nI would wait for a neutral, calm time to talk this out. Is this agreement not working for her anymore? If it is, then can she understand your perspective? She got two hours off while you carried one kid and chased another. That's stressful and I'm sure you could have used help, but you honored the agreement and dealt with it. If the agreement is not working for her, then what other ways can you *each* get fairly equal recharge time without interruption? Something's gotta give here. Also, make sure the breaks allow each of you to do something that's good for your mental health. For example, I take breaks to work out so I'm not an impatient crazy person at home.

She's right.", "YTA She wasn't \"off duty\" and since your legs weren't broken you could have easily taken a few minutes to help with one child while she dealt with the other.

You say your wife was off duty for two hours while you were out with the kids but was she REALLY off duty?\n\nWas she lyng down taking a break or was she handing out candy, doing the dinner dishes, finishing laundry, or meal planning or cleaning the bathroom or doing any of the many unseen chores that require physical or emotional effort?", "YTA\n\nSounds like assisting with the fight and keeping the kids separate is also a two person job. Sometimes kids change plans and you have to deal with that. Kids are tiring, yea. But She needed your help. Just because you don't ask for help doesn't mean she would never give it.\n\nTruthfully, this tag-in method doesn't sound that great if when you're \"On duty\" you're stretched so thin that you can't assist at all after? surely doing it all together (especially trick or treating) would make your lives easier and you wouldn't have to carry one kid and run after the otehr. two kids and once, two parents at once... Then no one would be drained after, or at least your de drained together. Both help get kids to bed then you can both rest?\n\n I guess do what you guys want but if this is going to become a source of conflict down the line, surely your game plan could use some revision?", "YTA. Tired of spending a few hours with your own children? Maybe teach them how to behave a little better if one runs away from you and the other can't walk on his own. 9 and 5 arent hard ages and should be expected to listen to their parent.

Surely she could have handled that better. Although I do agree, theres no such thing as an \u201coff duty\u201d parent. Definitely talk it out, hopefully you resolve this \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA.

If it was just a little squabble it doesn't take both of you to straighten it out, especially if you already have a Parenting agreement in place.

If roles were reversed, based on what I read on the sub, you would be labeled TA.
