My husband was born in America but his parents are from Ukraine. I was born in Moldova and moved to the US when I was a toddler. Moldova is a country right under Ukraine. We grew up in a slavic culture here in the US so both our families speak Russian and a little bit of Ukrainian. Because of USSR, many countries transitioned to the Russian language back then. Growing up, we always told everyone we were Russian because it was easier to say that then to actually explain where we were from. We are both bilingual and speak Russian and English very well. When the war in Ukraine started, my husband made it his mission to learn Ukrainian and had been very good with it. I was supportive and now I also understand Ukrainian and can hold a short conversation. Due to everything going on, many Ukrainians are dropping Russian as a language and going back to their native language. They are starting to hate everything Russian related and with the war going on, I kinda understand that. My husband and I had a conversation about our future kids and what languages we want them to know. We obviously agreed they need to know English, but that\u2019s where we kinda hit a nerve. Growing up speaking Russian, going to a Russian church, I expected my husband to want the kids to know Russian as well. He wants to stop speaking Russian altogether and only speak Ukrainian. I don\u2019t mind if the kids know all three, but he wants nothing to do with the Russian language. Ever since his parents hometown was invaded, he completely cut it out of his life. He speaks only English and Ukrainian to me and anyone else. He wants our kids to know only English and Ukrainian. That\u2019s it. Anyone speaking Russian can easily say that the Russian language is more active in the US than Ukrainian. Everyone important in our life speaks Russian! And none of them are actually Russian (which that was never an issue). I wouldn\u2019t make a big deal about it, but I just found out I\u2019m pregnant and he doesn\u2019t know yet. So this issue needs to be resolved a lot sooner than I expected. I told him that all our family/friends speaks Russian, I speak Russian and so our kids will at least know Russian too.

Your husband is definitely just having a difficult time due to the war. I would honestly just bring up to him that theres no negative with speaking Russian; if your children go back to your hometown and get taken hostage by soldiers during a war, knowing Russian would actually be beneficial for them to communicate as opposed to being entirely unable to. \n\nIn addition, if Russian is the primary language both your families speak, your children being unable to speak it will make bonding more difficult. \n\nI\u2019d say to bring this up to him in the future, theres plenty of time to have him come around.", "NTA.\nAs my grandma once said \"Don't punish the language for what its speakers have done.\" I understand it can be triggering, but I do not think completely cutting out a language you've both spoken your whole lives is the solution here.

That led to some problems in more emancipated countries after the USSR dissolved, example the baltic states, where the Russian migrants expected Russian to continue to be the main language.\n\nMoldova is one of the countries with a healthy mix of all those languages, so in principle you are right to insist \"teaching\" the kids your language.

Wanting your kids to know multiple languages is good, but right now Russian is (understandably) an incredibly sore spot for Ukrainians. \n\nYou will have quite a lot of work in teaching your kids one non-English language in an environment where media, school and.. well, *everything* is in English. Instead of worrying about them learning two languages on top of English from an early age, you could prepare them for learning it later if they so choose, by teaching them the alphabet (shared with Ukrainian anyway) and nursery rhymes that include phonemes that only appear in Russian.\n\nThe language is not at fault, but it will take a long time for Ukrainians to stop associating it with atrocities. Putting pressure on your husband now will stress you both out more, and is unnecessary since languages can be learned at any age.", "NTA, though I truly do understand where your husband is coming from.\n\nIt is important to talk to the kid in your mother tongue since you will express your emotions more freely, and it's important for their development ([source](https://bilinguistics.com/should-i-stop-speaking-my-native-language-with-my-children/), with some academic links).

Ignorance is unlikely to increase options.  Tell him that teaching your children Russian puts them in a much better situation in the future if things do continue as they are now, it\u2019s not like knowing the language is a position of weakness.", "NTA.

Go ahead and teach your kids Russian. Your husband is free to not speak it himself if he so desires.", "IMO, the more languages someone knows, the better. NTA for wanting your kids to know the same language as their families.", "NTA.\n\nMy language is Slavic (Serbian) and I can understand Ukrainian or Russian without much effort. Since kids are like sponges and Ukrainian and Russian are both Slavic languages, it would be soooo easy for them to learn both. Which won\u2019t hurt them. \n\nI also experienced a war, personally. It\u2019s a tough topic and something that actually doesn\u2019t get easier with time so you need to talk to him now.", "I don't think you would be TA for wanting the kids to learn Russian as well. I get that it's an emotionally charged question for your husband, but Russian isn't just the language of the current Russian regime. It's also the language of the Russian Orthodox church, the language of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, the one-time lingua franca of all the countries in the USSR, and so on. There's a thousand reasons to learn Russian, and most of them are completely untouched by the current political climate. War and Peace isn't any less of a masterpiece because of an invasion that started in 2022. I'd be thrilled to be able to read the original.\n\nLearning Russian and speaking Russian is not a sign of support for the regime, just like learning English doesn't mean you support whoever's in the current US government, learning Chinese doesn't mean you support the CCP, and learning Arabic doesn't mean you support the Saudis. All of these languages, English, Chinese, Arabic, and Russian, give you access to an entirely new corpus of media and history, one that extends back hundreds or even thousands of years. If your future children told you they wanted to learn Chinese, I'm sure your husband wouldn't forbid it because he doesn't like the CCP?", "NAH. I can understand why you want the kids to learn all three languages, and I think it's a good idea. But I can also understand why your husband feels the way he does. But you don't even have children yet. Leave it until you do, and by then hopefully Russia will have fucked off back home and Ukraine will be recovering.", "NAH. \n\nThis is clearly & understandably emotive issue for your husband, and you're seeing things more practically. Neither of you is in the wrong.", "I'm wondering how good your husband's Ukrainian is in the first place if he wants your child to speak it. I speak a bit of Russian myself having studied it in college, but I know that while knowing Russian will give you a leg up when learning Ukrainian, they're not the same language. \nIt doesn't sound like he speaks Ukrainian at native level so he shouldn't speak it with his son. What happens if his son finds Ukrainian-speaking friends later in life and finds out his Ukrainian is stunted because he was taught by someone who didn't speak it fluently?", "I'm going with NAH.\n\nYou're right. Your children should learn the 3 languages. The more languages the better! That will help them in their futures AND like you said, everybody you know already speaks Russian. \n\nI do understand your husband's side though. I completely get his kneejerk \"abolish every bit of Russia from our lives\" reaction. (My family is Lithuanian. I was born here in the US but they came here when the Soviets still controlled Lithuania and were killing everybody there. So suffice to say my family is very pro-Ukraine, anti-Russia.) \n\nI think maybe it would help to just keep approaching it from a standpoint of helping your kids. What if they go to Ukraine or Moldova in the future and there are Russians there? It's good for them to know Russian to communicate and be safe. What if knowing Russian will help them get better jobs? What if they want to live in Ukraine and help rebuild, it would help them to know Russian then too.

My parents are from Kharkiv and both speak Russian as their first language.

Learning Ukrainian, exclusive of Russian, has become an important expression of Ukrainian pride and identity, even before the most recent invasion.\n\nYour children now have the opportunity to reclaim that ancestry and learn to speak like native Ukrainian speakers. Trying to learn later in life will be much, much harder, and learning concurrently with Russian is likely to result in a Russian accent and speech patterns (ie pronunciation, sentence construction). If they learn Ukrainian only now, they will be able to pick up Russian easily later, but it would be much harder to go the other way or try to do both at once, simply by virtue of how dominant Russian is in terms of available media. In my Ukrainian class many years ago, most of us were people of Ukrainian descent whose parents had never learned the language so we were learning it all from scratch, but there was one guy in the class who spoke Russian, and he was constantly struggling with pronunciation - he had a harder time than the rest of us did picking up the nuances of the language.\n\nLet your kids grow up with their ancestral language, not the language of their invaders, genociders, and colonizers.

My husband was born in America but his parents are from Ukraine. I was born in Moldova and moved to the US when I was a toddler. Moldova is a country right under Ukraine. We grew up in a slavic culture here in the US so both our families speak Russian and a little bit of Ukrainian. Because of USSR, many countries transitioned to the Russian language back then. Growing up, we always told everyone we were Russian because it was easier to say that then to actually explain where we were from. We are both bilingual and speak Russian and English very well. When the war in Ukraine started, my husband made it his mission to learn Ukrainian and had been very good with it. I was supportive and now I also understand Ukrainian and can hold a short conversation. Due to everything going on, many Ukrainians are dropping Russian as a language and going back to their native language. They are starting to hate everything Russian related and with the war going on, I kinda understand that. My husband and I had a conversation about our future kids and what languages we want them to know. We obviously agreed they need to know English, but that\u2019s where we kinda hit a nerve. Growing up speaking Russian, going to a Russian church, I expected my husband to want the kids to know Russian as well. He wants to stop speaking Russian altogether and only speak Ukrainian. I don\u2019t mind if the kids know all three, but he wants nothing to do with the Russian language. Ever since his parents hometown was invaded, he completely cut it out of his life. He speaks only English and Ukrainian to me and anyone else. He wants our kids to know only English and Ukrainian. That\u2019s it. Anyone speaking Russian can easily say that the Russian language is more active in the US than Ukrainian. Everyone important in our life speaks Russian! And none of them are actually Russian (which that was never an issue). I wouldn\u2019t make a big deal about it, but I just found out I\u2019m pregnant and he doesn\u2019t know yet. So this issue needs to be resolved a lot sooner than I expected. I told him that all our family/friends speaks Russian, I speak Russian and so our kids will at least know Russian too.

This is because her husband\u2019s stance on this is born of a lot of ongoing pain, as she noted in her post, and that\u2019s important for him to process and important for her to understand and be able to partner with him in addressing. u/wnnabesahm, if your user name indicates you will be becoming a SAHM sooner rather than later with this new child, this is even more critical - your husband will benefit from reassurance that you and he are on the same page with regards to values and child rearing, if you are going to be their primary influence more hours of the day than him. \n\nThings that may help steer some discussions:\n\n- Has your husband been able to connect meaningfully with some specifically Ukrainian cultural resources in your current community? This might help him, especially if he worries about his ancestral homeland\u2019s culture being physically eradicated, or even if he feels some (unfounded but probably common) guilt for not being there fighting on the front lines, or for having been born in a different country than his parents were. Coincidentally, it would also give him access to people who are ethnically / culturally Ukrainian and may be able to speak to the language issue from diverse viewpoints from the \u201cinside.\u201d\n\n- Is \u201creclaiming\u201d the language a point of view he might be interested in? Many people around the world speak English as a first language, not because it\u2019s what their native land\u2019s people originally spoke, but because England was a brutally effective colonizer and America has been the hegemon for many decades now. Many countries that have Anglicized official names (T\u00fcrkiye comes to mind, but I believe India has a similar movement, and there is the ongoing debate about Burma vs Myanmar) are or have considered adjusting or outright changing their official names to better reflect their national identity and autonomy. Perhaps Russian as  a language can come to mean something different than Russia the country for your husband, and he can view the name of the country (Ukraine) being what is the key differentiator rather than the shared language. \n\n- Russia is of course enormous and diverse. Plenty of accounts suggest there are Russians who disagree with this war against Ukraine, and reports are that many ethnic groups may be targeted and forced to the front lines as cannon fodder. This underlines that \u201cRussians\u201d are not a monolith and perhaps your husband can relate that to whatever his politics are in the US: over the years there have been many Americans who strongly disagreed with a variety of the country\u2019s official policies and actions or inactions abroad (e.g. all sides of Vietnam, Korea, Cuba, Japan, Israel, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, South Africa, Somalia, Sudan, Crimea). Wherever his politics lie on non-Ukrainian issues, perhaps this will give you two opportunities to discuss how the politics of one era may diverge wildly from the politics of another within the same population or political entity \u2026 examples within the US include slavery, reconstruction, civil rights (race, gender, sexuality and gender) and so forth. Examples in Russia of course include the Bolshevik revolution, Lenin vs Stalin, communism vs democracy, and so forth. \n\n- Your husband\u2019s parents must be in mourning for their childhood homeland, and may be feeling erased (almost literally, since you say their hometown was destroyed).  Are there things you can do as a couple or group to celebrate their culture and background? Maybe you could do DNA testing or genealogy research and turn the results into an art project (maybe get a family tree embroidered on Etsy or something, and frame it for them). Perhaps with a new grandchild on the way, they\u2019d be open to being \u201cinterviewed\u201d for memories and stories of their early years and family history, to be made into lasting legacies (there are services that will edit videos or produce books based on interview materials) to share with your future children as you raise them, and passed down to their own children and so on in the years to come. This doesn\u2019t have to be centered around what\u2019s going on in Ukraine today (although it certainly could be) - but it might help your ILs feel heard and give them reassurance that their family line will continue to know and value their Ukrainian roots. \n\n- Would your husband perhaps find value in volunteering (with you or alone) with groups helping Ukrainian immigrants to the US, gathering resources to send to displaced Ukrainians abroad, or lobbying for policies that support Ukraine with international organizations?\n\nGood luck - both as you navigate the mourning your husband is feeling regarding what\u2019s happening in Ukraine, and as you embark together on the great adventure of parenthood!", "I don\u2019t see why not learn all 3.

At the time, promoting Ukrainian was seen as a bit of a losing battle. Most textbooks for learning Ukrainian as a Second Language were published in Canada by communities that predated the USSR, and as a result could contain older idioms. My class used what was basically a tourist language guide, because that's what was available. It is significantly harder to learn Ukrainian than Russian, simply by virtue of the resources available, both pedagogical and popular media. It's incredibly heartening to see this resurgence of the Ukrainian language as an expression of national identity.\n\nYou're right, this has potential to be a compatibility issue, but I think right now there's a pretty straightforward and low-conflict solution that stems from the reality of those same family dynamics. The kids will almost certainly pick up some Russian no matter what, and they'll definitely be able to understand it and communicate with relatives speaking Russian. It sounds like the dad doesn't want an outright ban on Russian in their presence entirely, or punish the kids if they learn some, just not actively teach them Russian. It's a passive vs active distinction. If he got militant about enforcing a No Russian Language Zone around them, yeah he'd be an AH, and he would be the one who needs to compromise. If the kids develop a strong preference for Russian over Ukrainian, again he'd have to compromise, and at least they've gotten that early access to learning Ukrainian, which is much harder to access than Russian.\n\nPrioritizing Ukrainian is not incompatible with forming a bond with Russian-speaking relatives, even if there are some who don't speak English, though based on the post is seems like they all or nearly all do. Unlike the generations of us who grew up without Ukrainian, I'm not seeing a denial of access to heritage or the ability to communicate here, at least as far as I understand the father's objectives as described. Right now, it's to the children's benefit for the mother to compromise on which language they are actively taught, with an acknowledgement from the father that they'll pick up an understanding of Russian almost by default, and will likely also end up speaking some Russian by virtue of ease of access.\n\nI think the closest analogy we might be able to get in North America is someone of Native ancestry deciding to raise their children in their ancestral language, knowing that the kids will pick up English no matter what by virtue of its cultural dominance and widespread use.", "My sub-point is that it can, which you supported.

It\u2019s important to many people to show that Ukraine in a separate culture, with a distinct and separate language, and of course is a separate country. And that their language, culture and people are not inferior, nor are they Russians as Putin likes to claim. It\u2019s a matter of civic pride in a way that can\u2019t be compared to speaking English, because England never claimed that the citizens of English occupied territories were actually English themselves, nor tried to completely exterminate the local cultures and force people to *only* speak English, or face punishment (the exception here are the indigenous tribes that were utterly stripped of language, culture and rights and still have to face the fact that their oppressors have built societal systems over the mass graves of their people).", "Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovskia, Romania, Hungary.\n\nJust an example of countries who made their original language to the official languages after the occupation of the russians ended.\n\n\nIraq, Korea, Vietnam.\n\nJust an example of countrys who dont speak english after they were invaded by the USA.", "Not teaching her kids HER native language because of politics is ridiculous.

Like you don\u2019t need to learn to speak multiple Romance languages all at once as a kid, you can learn just one and then add others on later and you get the benefits as if you did learn it younger because there are enough similarities between Romance languages that stuff transfers.", "If they're making shit up to put in their comments, they are lying.", "She literally says they speak Russian.", "Forbes puts them at 11, so top 10%.", "\"Everybody from Eastern block can speak some Russian\" is not the same as Russian being their first language.

I imagine growing up speaking any Slavic language would make it easier to learn another Slavic language. Certainly the sounds of Ukrainian are more similar to Russian than to English for example. I\u2019m just addressing the idea which the commenter implied that Ukrainian is somehow a dialect of Russian or even the same language. That\u2019s an idea that has been promoted by Russian nationalists since at least the 18th century and which is used to justify the Russian state\u2019s current policies of forced Russification in the areas it controls.

The Russian government is making an organized effort to assimilate and wipe out the Ukrainian culture, replacing it with Russian. This act is more of a rebellion against the Russian government's plans than anything.\n\nBesides, though it isn't all Russians nor all Russian speakers, is Putin the one sending each bomb? Is he the one shooting tied up civilians in the back of the head? Is he the one driving the tanks into Ukraine? No, those are Russian people. Many of them ordinary civilians whom were drafted into the war after it started.\n\nSo yes, a majority of the Russian people are innocent, or even if they support the war, aren't committing the crimes directly. But a large portion of Russian people, many of whom considered Ukrainians to be brothers less than 2 years ago, are now slaughtering Ukrainians.", "They are Ukrainian and Moldovan, not Russian at all.\n\nThe kid will learn Russian language anyway if the father speaks Ukrainian and mom and rest of the family speaks Russian. There is really no need for the dad to speak Russian. \n\nI would also like to point out that you can't completely separate the state and the Russian people and completely remove blame from the people. Sure a lot of civilians are in a shitty situation and against the war but there is a lot of average Russians who actually do support the war and feel like Russia has the right to invade/occupy others as they are the \"master race\". \n\nI can't really blame the dude for wanting to maintain his Ukrainian heritage/culture/language and having an emotional reaction to all this."]}
