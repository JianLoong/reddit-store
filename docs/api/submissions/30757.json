I confirmed the date with my mother and then said I would actually be out of town that day for a paid gig with my side job as a singer. My mother was shocked when she heard this and said I was being an asshole for not immediately cancelling these plans to celebrate with my family as in isn\u2019t my real job, just a side gig. This gig was organised around six months ago as it is a Christmas Party and dates in December typically book out fast. For added context I rarely see my cousin and haven\u2019t spoken to her in years. She and her partner have been together over ten years and have two children together. I don\u2019t feel like this is a an occasion I particularly need to go to but my family now all seems to agree that I am choosing the wrong event.

Surprise we\u2019re doing this and you need to cancel everything. That\u2019s asshole behaviour whatever your plans are. Plus if you cancel last minute it might get you blackballed so it could damage your career. If they\u2019d said 6 months ago then my answer would be different", "A \"Surprise Wedding\"? WTF is that about? NTA...\nI used to sing in a cover band so I understand where you are coming from. I'm guessing that you perform with other people/musicians  too so your absence would mess things up for them as well along with creating negative publicity for cancelling, leaving whoever hired you to try to book someone else at this late date.\nYou made a commitment. If your family can't repect that, that's their problem.\nSend a nice card and appropriate gift with your parents.", "NTA, people who decide to have a surprise wedding should consider that chances are the dates they chose are already reserved", "You were not given advance notice and are only honoring your prior commitments. You would be leaving your commitment in the lurch just because your cousin is a bad planner. What did your sister say about all this?", "NTA. Most weddings have way more notice than what you got. Part of the \u201csurprise\u201d should accommodate for \u201csurprise, I can\u2019t make it\u201d. \n\nConsider how badly the Christmas party would be impacted given that they booked you in six months ago. I\u2019d feel bad for them trying to fill the spot, especially given how hard it is to secure entertainment in December.", "NTA\n\nYou barely have a relationship with your cousin anyway. And four weeks is way too short for a wedding.", "NTA.\n\n\"Sorry but since I don't work a 9-5,  I can't to to your wedding and pay my bills\"", "NTA. You already have plans. You\u2019d be letting people down at short notice if you pulled out of the gig. You\u2019re not close. Anything could happen between now and then like covid and the wedding being cancelled.", "I may be a little biased, but I find weddings to be overrated these days. The fact that they've been together for a decade with two kids and spontaneously decided to get married just proves my point. What exactly changes between them? It's more of a novelty than a testament to a strong and healthy bond.\n\nYou've planned this gig six months in advance. By the sound of it, they planned theirs on a whim. You don't even talk to them, and everybody expects you to drop your plans for their sake? That's not how things work, and labeling it a \"surprise\" wedding doesn't make it any less of an inconvenience.\n\nNTA. Get that bag.", "NTA \n\n'Surprise wedding=Surprise!!! I can't attend as I have other plans in place. \n\nAll the best '\n\nTell your mother/family that since they didn't check to see if you were free on that date your presence obviously isn't that important to them. Tell them you will of course buy them a gift and congratulate them when you can.\n\nI would also tell them that price for gift+ lost wages for the event + future lost wages that you will lose for being unreliable+ clothes/event related costs   amounts to a pretty hefty sum you can't afford to give them as  'gift'", "Surprise!

Even if you and your cousin were close, you're under no obligation to do anything for free for anyone else (unless they're your dependent, maybe). You're also not required to attend events you do not wish to attend. Your mother comes across as manipulative in this situation.", "NTA in reality, but understand your family may not agree.", "NTA.  You don\u2019t want to be viewed as unreliable by canceling at the last minute AND more importantly, you are not close to the cousin.  Keep the gig. Mom will have to get over it", "NTA. Hell I wouldn\u2019t even go to my own cousins wedding if I barely interact with them.", "NTA.\nI have been to one surprise wedding and it was advertised as the engagement party. Plus guests were informed two days before hand.\n\nIf you are doing a surprise wedding you have an event lined up FIRST.", "NTA.  Plenty of people do not attend a relative's wedding because of previous engagements, paid or otherwise.", "This is literally the reason why people send out \u2018save the date\u2019s well in advance of an important event. You were not asked to save the date, and as it happens you have a prior commitment. It is always rude to cancel a prior commitment in favour of a last minute counter offer, and in this case it would cause considerable inconvenience to a lot of other people and reputational damage to you. Absolutely NTA", "NTA.  It's not clear that you're even invited to the \"surprise wedding\".  Even if you are the wedding of a cousin you don't really know isn't enough to cancel a longstanding commitment.", "Mum's know how to guilt trip the best, don't they? \n\nIt's irrelevant what anyone thinks, family, partner or internet stranger. You have made a long-term commitment you want to keep to. To cancel at this stage might impact your future bookings - thus don't set yourself on fire to keep a distant relative warm.  If your cousin sees your presence as so imprtant she wouldn't have sprung the date on you at such short notice - People have lives!", "NTA. Visit with your cousin sometime in their 4 week visit, send a card and maybe a gift to the wedding if you're so inclined and enjoy your gig.", "INFO: are you even invited? Your mother called you to tell you about this, not your cousin. I don't see an \"official\" invitation mentioned anywhere, just your mother's presumption. And by \"official\" I don't mean you have to have a gold stamped letter, just your cousin actually expressing to you that you are invited.", "NTA. Absolutely not. A previous engagement prevents you from going to the wedding. And you are not even close with the bride. Your mother should get her priorities right. Your singing career may be a side hustle, but if word gets out that the singer is a flake, that career may go quickly down the drain.", "NTA. You made a commitment to perform and you should keep it. IMO, it's ridiculous that your family expect you to cancel.", "Nta. I dont think cousin will mind. If she minds then she is being the ah. If you suddenly throw a surprise wedding, be prepared that people will not attend it.", "NTA\nIf they plan a surprise wedding, they should not be surprised if some people already made different plans.", "nta - your family is exhibiting asshole behavior.  you made a committment for work side gig or not it is still a paid job.", "Especially around the holidays! What a nightmare. Even if you didn\u2019t already have a commitment @op, I would still say NTA if you didn\u2019t want to go. No offense but your mother sounds a tad manipulative.", "Only OP\u2019s mother has an issue. Not the couple themselves. \n\nNTA. You\u2019re not free to attend. That\u2019s perfectly fine", "Good point. The prior commitment is a valid reason. OP's mom overreacted", "Yeah. People need to learn how to take no for an answer. Especially with short notice events", "Maybe OP's mum had already volunteered OP's singing skills for the wedding.\n\nNTA, OP.", "Yeah I feel so too. She might be embarrassed that she volunteered his services but he\u2019s unavailable"]}
