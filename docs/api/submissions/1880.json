It is possible for your daughter to meet, talk to, and befriend her bio parent(s). Every year I get a Christmas card, and I send a gift to the child I gave for adoption. Every year I see them for a few hours in the middle of summer. I spend time playing with them on the playground that we go to and I deeply enjoy getting to hear them talk and show me all the things they\u2019re able to do! (the best conversation I\u2019ve had this year was asking the kid what they\u2019d name a dragon and what color/powers they\u2019d want their dragon to have). (Vague/gender neutral wording for the privacy of the adoptive family *because I respect their parenting choice of wanting me to not post pictures of the child which I extend to wording too*).\n\nI\u2019ve seen what saying that you\u2019ll allow for an open relationship with the bio parent(s) only to not follow through has done to the mental state of so many people. I\u2019ve seen how absolutely destroyed they are. I\u2019ve seen bio parents become pregnant years later only to say that they have to remind themselves that \u201cthis baby isn\u2019t *child who was adopted\u2019s name*\u201d. I\u2019ve seen them sob, I\u2019ve seen them unable to get proper counseling because there aren\u2019t enough people who specialize in *death like grief without the death*. (Source: a birthmother\u2019s retreat I went to in 2019)\n\nOP, right now you are actively hurting two people: your daughter, and Erica. You clearly paid for Erica\u2019s college accommodations as a way to buy her out of any contact attempts. You aren\u2019t *comfortable* but you\u2019re not considering how your daughter will feel once she\u2019s an adult and you drop this bombshell on her. **Are you even going to actually tell her, or did you just say that in an attempt to keep Erica from asking again?**\nYour daughter is going to have a lot of questions, none are going to be *comfortable*. She\u2019s going to be rightfully upset about being lied to by omission. She has a counselor, a wonderful tool to help her deal with all the emotions she may end up having. She\u2019s going to have questions about why you didn\u2019t tell her for so long, about why she was never allowed to meet her bio mom but you let her bio dad be in her life anyway, about why Erica kept her other child but didn\u2019t keep her, about why Erica and your son didn\u2019t want to raise her\u2026 she\u2019s not going to have *comfortable* questions. OP YTA. Erica isn\u2019t asking to coparent. She\u2019s just asking to meet the little girl she gave you. \n\nAnd ffs join some adoption groups!

Erica could have easily decided to go through an adoption agency and chosen or **LET** another set of parents adopt the child she had. Through this channel she also could have had access to legally binding contact agreements that would prevent the adoptive parents from letting her get to know the child she birthed. It would also prevent her from backing out of keeping contact with the adoptive family (yes legally, as in court can be used if it\u2019s not followed through with). **The reason it\u2019s important for adoptees to know that they are adopted is because many learning disabilities, mental health problems, and issues with substance abuse can be inherited.** It can be therapeutic (or cause increased trauma, depends on the situation) for the bio parent(s) to interact with the adoptee. It\u2019s important to have a line of communication open for medical questions, or general personality questions. Whether you realize it or not an adoptee is going to develop personality traits from bio parents. Say Erica had a twilight obsession in high school, and in a few years OP\u2019s daughter develops a super fan obsession with twilight or another fantasy creature world. That\u2019s an inherited personality trait and it\u2019s great to have that information simply to have a better understanding of what to potentially expect.\n\nSo yeah Erica and her family LET OP and her husband adopt the child. They could have LET someone else adopt her, but they LET OP do it instead. Quit this fear mongering bs. No one is going to take the kid so that Erica can meet her.

Any therapist would tell you it\u2019s better to be transparent from the beginning and you\u2019re doing much more damage keeping this from her!", "So let me get this straight:\n\nYour son and his baby's mother were young as fuck, made a mistake, and decided it was in their best interest to not keep the kid. Fine. Dandy. Happens all the time.\n\nYou and your wife proceeded to basically purchase this small human off of them. And then financially provide for this young person if they gave you said child. Not only is this trafficking, this feels super manipulative and power imbalancing.\n\nYou then proceeded (you conveniently left thisnout in your main post), to lie to this child. That she was your own and that her father was her brother. So not only did you traffick this human being, you lied to her, and proceeded to think it was a great idea to keep her in a VERY compromised living situation....seriously, her bio dad, still in her life, as her BROTHER??\n\nYou then proceeded to tell the birth mother she MAY have access to her child. You very obviously didn't create any legal setup to ensure that this wouldn't become a giant mess later on by agreeing on no contact or allowing visitation. No. You lied to your daughter AND gave a woman a vague answer to an important question.\n\nThis small human is going to therapy. For an existing anxiety issue. She's being lied to by her \"folks\". And she's probably very shortly about to have her entire life upended because you handled this in every wrong way imaginable. Statistically? Keeping this from her as long as you did (and if you somehow manage to keep it longer), the inevitable upending with the truth, etc....she is going to be FUCKED. You have written this in stone for her already. Accept this now. And pushing it off \"until she's well\" isn't gonna happen. Anxiety disorders and the like don't just \"go away\" one day. She's going to be HOPEFULLY coping with this, with the help of therapy, for the rest of her life. \n\nLike this is actually insane. I'm EXTREMELY curious how the adoption and the settlement and agreement even went down to begin with, because this sounds all sorts of Kentucky Fried Fucked. I can't imagine an adoption agency or anything would have been ok with this situation in any way shape or form. Or how they would be ok with any of this\n\n\nMAJOR YTA, and get to a therapist who can deal with adoption STAT. Because you all are gonna need it real soon, especially if Erica and the family are so intent on meeting this child.", "YTA what the hell do you think is going to happen when you finally tell her that her whole life is a lie? Do you honestly think everyone is going to play happy families? You are in for one hell of a shock! She will feel betrayed by you, your husband and your entire family as she is the only person who didn\u2019t know. Can you not for a second put yourself in the 11yr old shoes and think about the scenario: your life is a lie. Everyone but you knows that your brother is actually your dad who got a 17yr old pregnant and the people you thought were your parents threatened them with only two options - being kicked out on their own with no help or give up the baby and we pay some rent to the vulnerable teenage mother we convinced to give up their baby to keep her off our backs? \n\nEveryone has lied to this child throughout their entire life. You should have told her years ago and I\u2019m surprised someone never did, now you\u2019re gonna blindside a depressed and anxious teenager with such a bomb. Everyone is telling you here from their own experiences that this will royally fuck her up the longer you keep this secret. She will suffer for your selfishness. Poor kid, poor Erica and I honestly feel some sympathy for your son as you basically didn\u2019t give him much of a choice here. You could of helped these young parents yet you literally only gave them two extreme options. You and your husband are a terrible parents.

I think 15-ish is a more appropriate age where she is more emotionally developed and can handle such a bomb going off in her life.\n\nI also didn\u2019t know one of my parents growing up and was 24 when I met him. One of my brothers didn\u2019t know this same parent either and met him at 16 and it really kind of messed him up. So I think the older the better", "YTA. This is a very open secret that won't be kept for much longer.

Yes you should have told your adopted daughter that she was adopted from birth when she was like 6 or 7 years old so she can get an understanding and have counseling ready. You do need to tell her now and add on to the fact of it. However you're not in the wrong here when it comes to looking out for her mental and emotional well-being when it comes to situation. Your son basically wants nothing to do with this child but yet he still with his baby's mother and has another baby with her. They don't want the child they just want to have the easy parts now that there's only six or seven years left of the child's upbringing. You're not in the wrong here you do need to tell her the truth now and tell her in the presence of her therapist and make it known to therapist the whole situation. Lastly and most importantly you need to tell the bio Mom's family and the bio Mom are you in this for just your own appeasement or are you in this because you just can't deal with the regret that you gave up your daughter for adoption. She didn't want to raise her daughter you bought this up 3 years ago when this first happened and now all of a sudden she wants to know her daughter my advice is simple tell her you major decision now you need to lie in it and I will tell my daughter the truth but you will respect us as the parents or else we will limit contact with you all together\n\n\nEdit to add: Most of the people who are saying you're in the wrong are people who will sympathize with the biological mother even though she didn't have any interest in her daughter until now to where this new baby made her think you need to make it known to everybody involved including your son that you're not going to be in her life just because you had a new baby. Now you can either go to therapy or I will tell her everything about how you didn't want her and how you didn't want her and it made this new baby want her. They both abandon their child and everybody wants you to either give up the child and cause an even more of an identity crisis instead of just basically doing what's right. The people who are calling you in a hole are people who would rather have sympathy for a woman who abandon her child instead of the woman who's been taking care of the child. Yes you should have told your daughter when she was six or seven but that's beside the point tell her now and with the therapist in the room not to mention tell the therapist beforehand of the situation but under no circumstances are the bio parents or the other grandparents allowed to be anywhere near her for her own mental and emotional well-being. Make it known you are not the bad guy in all this you're just the person who pretty much society will rather crucify for not telling this girl she was adopted when she was younger instead of basically looking out for her best when it comes to her mental and emotional well-being. And to anyone criticizing her screw off until you're in her shoes you have no idea what it's like to be the person raising the child instead of the person abandoning the child.", "YTA. Mostly because you have not been honest about her parentage with her. I get that you wanted to play pretend that you have another biological kid but that is for your benefit not hers and a parent or guardian\u2019s first duty is to the child. Her best interest. Her maternal family is already shooting off their mouths. How long do you think it will be before someone says something where she can hear it? Or that it gets thrown in her face? Do you honestly think that will help her anxiety? Does having secrets kept from you not make you feel more anxious?  Talk to her therapist and find the right way to tell her the truth as soon as possible and if she asks  before you can work that out, DO NOT LIE to her. Just let her know that she is getting old enough to know all the facts about where she comes from and you wanted to talk to an expert on how best to tell her. DO NOT bad mouth her parents. Not for the decisions they made when they were young and not for the ones they\u2019ve made since. They are the place she cones from. That would be like telling her that part of her is bad.
