Most women who give up children do it because their socioeconomic position makes them feel unable to raise a child and then adoption clinics and society tell them they\u2019re right. It\u2019s a symptom of a country without proper social supports, not child abandonment. Feel free to do some research on first parents and their experiences.\n\nFurther, infants that are separated from their mothers are often traumatized, even if they cannot remember the initial trauma. OPs daughter is struggling with anxiety, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a complete coincidence. OP is doing what is best for her and her husband and that\u2019s what she\u2019s done for 11 years.

They did this because they love you so much that they wanted you to have opportunities and a life that they weren't able to offer you themselves.\"\n\nIt is the only decent thing to do, and this child should have been told about the adoption as soon as she was old enough to start asking where babies come from.", "I mean yes? The fact that she is adopted is going to come out eventually, especially with all the genetic testing sites out there.

She'll still feel betrayed if you tell her now, but it's something you can work through together in therapy. If you keep this secret from her for longer though... There are many children who were adopted who cut off their adoptive parents after finding out they were *lied to* all their life. Psychologists say it's in the best interest of the kid to know early on that they are adopted.   \n\n\nYou're just being selfish and not thinking of your daughter's well being there.

Not some big reveal later on. She needs to know who she is. I think that is the first step, and meeting mom will come when she's ready.", "Adoptee here. \nStudies show that hiding a child\u2019s adoption from them is harmful and traumatic. \nShe should have been raised knowing she was adopted.", "She should know already. She should've always known. You're doing more harm waiting to tell her. Possibly  ruining your future relationship", "So this is all about YOU.", "You need to tell her soon.

So separation from a biological mother will always cause an infant some trauma, but yeah, from any trusted adult, it\u2019s going to create abandonment issues and feelings of isolation.

If the 11 year old found out earlier she would feel awful for being unwanted and not love by her biological parents. \n\nIf she was given to an agency it would be the same. Her new parents probably wouldn't tell her until they though she was ready.
