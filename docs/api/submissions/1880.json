It is possible for your daughter to meet, talk to, and befriend her bio parent(s). Every year I get a Christmas card, and I send a gift to the child I gave for adoption. Every year I see them for a few hours in the middle of summer. I spend time playing with them on the playground that we go to and I deeply enjoy getting to hear them talk and show me all the things they\u2019re able to do! (the best conversation I\u2019ve had this year was asking the kid what they\u2019d name a dragon and what color/powers they\u2019d want their dragon to have). (Vague/gender neutral wording for the privacy of the adoptive family *because I respect their parenting choice of wanting me to not post pictures of the child which I extend to wording too*).\n\nI\u2019ve seen what saying that you\u2019ll allow for an open relationship with the bio parent(s) only to not follow through has done to the mental state of so many people. I\u2019ve seen how absolutely destroyed they are. I\u2019ve seen bio parents become pregnant years later only to say that they have to remind themselves that \u201cthis baby isn\u2019t *child who was adopted\u2019s name*\u201d. I\u2019ve seen them sob, I\u2019ve seen them unable to get proper counseling because there aren\u2019t enough people who specialize in *death like grief without the death*. (Source: a birthmother\u2019s retreat I went to in 2019)\n\nOP, right now you are actively hurting two people: your daughter, and Erica. You clearly paid for Erica\u2019s college accommodations as a way to buy her out of any contact attempts. You aren\u2019t *comfortable* but you\u2019re not considering how your daughter will feel once she\u2019s an adult and you drop this bombshell on her. **Are you even going to actually tell her, or did you just say that in an attempt to keep Erica from asking again?**\nYour daughter is going to have a lot of questions, none are going to be *comfortable*. She\u2019s going to be rightfully upset about being lied to by omission. She has a counselor, a wonderful tool to help her deal with all the emotions she may end up having. She\u2019s going to have questions about why you didn\u2019t tell her for so long, about why she was never allowed to meet her bio mom but you let her bio dad be in her life anyway, about why Erica kept her other child but didn\u2019t keep her, about why Erica and your son didn\u2019t want to raise her\u2026 she\u2019s not going to have *comfortable* questions. OP YTA. Erica isn\u2019t asking to coparent. She\u2019s just asking to meet the little girl she gave you. \n\nAnd ffs join some adoption groups! Your daughter could benefit heavily from knowing other children who are adopted, and you could benefit from speaking to other adoptive parents!", "This right here. You are disgusting for this.", "She\u2019s the mother of your granddaughter.", "How repugnant.", "But she's completely unaware that she's adopted and doesn't know that her \"brother\" is actually her father. You are going to ruin your relationship with her when she finds out you've been lying to her for *11 years*.", "So your son, a legal adult, got a technical child pregnant, and you still think it's ok for the son to only have contact? I feel so bad for the two young girls that were failed here", "That is a horrible thing to do to an adopted child.\n\nYTA", "This is your HUGE mistake, and it might be something your daughter will never forgive nor get over. \n\nDid you honestly believe that she would never find out? That you and everyone else would keep this secret from her for her entire life? \n\nPlease contact a therapist whose speciality is young adolescents and teens and seek a way to tell your daughter her truth. \n\nIMO, Erica\u2019s \u201crights\u201d aren\u2019t even in the equation at this point. Your daughter needs to know her history. Everyone else\u2019s \u201crights\u201d (including yours) are beyond secondary.", "Talk to a psychologist or look up studies please! Because what you are doing is what every psychologist says NOT to do because keeping it a secret for so long is detrimental to the child.", "Maybe not Erica, but what about her parents? That comment about them \"letting\" you adopt is a red flag for me. I really would consider talking to a specialist about what the right course of action is.", "You just can\u2019t be this naive. \n\nEVERYONE knows except your daughter! You don\u2019t think her parents will tell her? Erica\u2019s extended family? Erica? Three years is a long time, and now Erica has another child. \n\nAll of your comments are justifying your decision. Hold onto that when your daughter bolts at 18 years of age.", "Yes, my best friend in elementary school had a very young \"aunt\".  Like we were 7 and she was 12.\n\nYears later it came out she was actually Dena's cousin.  Her mom's oldest sister got pregnant while living in another state. Her grandma drove there, picked up the baby and raised her as a \"surprise\" youngest.  They finally revealed the story after her grandad (a pastor) died.  He wanted to protect their reputation.", "This happened to the actor Jack Nicholson.   In 1974, Time magazine researchers learned, and informed Nicholson, that his \"sister\", June, was actually his mother, and his other \"sister\", Lorraine, was really his aunt. By this time, both his mother and grandmother had died (in 1963 and 1970, respectively). On finding out, Nicholson said it was \"a pretty dramatic event, but it wasn't what I'd call traumatizing ... I was pretty well psychologically formed\".", "I was adopted as a baby by my paternal grandparents, so raised with my sperm donor as my \u201cbrother\u201dhe\u2019s a shit person, my egg donor is a shit person, my parents are amazing but they did fuck up by not telling me sooner. Actually I don\u2019t know, it would have traumatized me either way. I knew I was adopted pretty early on, who my bio parents were was destined to fuck me up. I\u2019m alright now.", "I also agree as an adoptee", "Oh don\u2019t worry by later IP probably means 30.  It will go over great then. /s", "I came to the comments to say exactly this.\u2b06\ufe0f", "She has no intention of ever telling the child about the adoption. She\u2019s hoping Erica gives up and moves on", "Or before Brother-Father tells her. This was a stupid, stupid game OP decided to play with the lives of then-adolescents (the biological parents) and now the current child.", "The perfect time was starting from when she was adopted. The second best time is now.", "Not to mention how she probably has a feeling of sadness because she thinks her brother hates her and wants nothing to do with her. She probably Questions why her parents hear from him but he never calls her. Poor girl lives with a literal narcissist who has pulled every move she has made to benefit her. Being grandma was never enough, you HAD to be that baby's mother or nothing at all right? Are we sure it was Erica's parents that made that threat and not you to your own son?", "Disgusting. You are a terrible parent. Your child deserved to know HER truth long ago. Good luck dropping that bomb and her going LC or NC. \n\nYTA 1000 times.", "So you financially pressured your son and his ex into giving you their child. No wonder your relationship with your son is \u201cpoor.\u201d You forced him into a situation that\u2019s absolutely monstrous for everyone involved. And you are right on track to alienate your adopted daughter by withholding this information and putting her in the position of having a \u201cbrother\u201d who\u2019s actually her father in the first place. This kind of thing didn\u2019t work in the \u201850s, and it sure as hell doesn\u2019t work now. YTA.", "It\u2019s not. Erica could have easily decided to go through an adoption agency and chosen or **LET** another set of parents adopt the child she had. Through this channel she also could have had access to legally binding contact agreements that would prevent the adoptive parents from letting her get to know the child she birthed. It would also prevent her from backing out of keeping contact with the adoptive family (yes legally, as in court can be used if it\u2019s not followed through with). **The reason it\u2019s important for adoptees to know that they are adopted is because many learning disabilities, mental health problems, and issues with substance abuse can be inherited.** It can be therapeutic (or cause increased trauma, depends on the situation) for the bio parent(s) to interact with the adoptee. It\u2019s important to have a line of communication open for medical questions, or general personality questions. Whether you realize it or not an adoptee is going to develop personality traits from bio parents. Say Erica had a twilight obsession in high school, and in a few years OP\u2019s daughter develops a super fan obsession with twilight or another fantasy creature world. That\u2019s an inherited personality trait and it\u2019s great to have that information simply to have a better understanding of what to potentially expect.\n\nSo yeah Erica and her family LET OP and her husband adopt the child. They could have LET someone else adopt her, but they LET OP do it instead. Quit this fear mongering bs. No one is going to take the kid so that Erica can meet her. They\u2019re all aware of the legal issues something like kidnapping would have. Take a look at some of OP\u2019s other comments. It\u2019s clear that she pressured Erica (**who would have been 17 or 18 at the time**) to give her the baby. She pressured a teenager to give her her baby.", "Yes, I don\u2019t understand that comment either - they didn\u2019t offer to adopt, or even support Erica. I just said my then adult son because he was 22, would have to move out and work but they essentially told Erica she\u2019d be dead to them.", "Happened to someone I know too. Found out they was adopted and their parents were their bio mum\u2019s parents as a teenager and went completely off the rails. They've not given me specifics just that it was bad enough that they ended up in care for a while because their parents couldn't cope anymore", "My best friend had an aunt her age. I thought it was so weird lol. But they just had her late in life.", "How wild. My daughter's mother's father (so basically my daughter's grandfather) would travel to different states and make families. \n\nI once approved for my daughter to go to a gathering, to meet her SISTER AUNT. She was 3 years older than my daughter. \n\nIt was weird and my daughter wanted to call her her sister but I definitely corrected her. I didn't want a relationship to be forced or established in that kind of way. I never heard much about her because she only came about as a surprise because her father was dying at the time. \n\nWeird shit comes out and the most awful times. \n\nDon't do that, people. Just don't.", "It makes me think something else is going on in their lives. Does one of them need a kidney or something?", "I\u2019m also adopted, but I\u2019ve always known, I was adopted out of care at 11. I can\u2019t imagine what a shock it would be to suddenly find out.", "No, we spoke a week before everything went down and nothing is going on with them physically, they do say Erica is depressed though.", "Yeh, I imagine there's a significant difference between being adopted at 11 and finding out you're adopted at 11, lol.\n\nThat had to have been awesome for you though =) (I hope)", "Ah, the quick cure route. Nope, nope, nope, your daughter is not an emotional support animal.", "But she IS a person who deserves to know where she came from.", "For sure, which is why I said they should go to a specialist to figure out the best way to do it since she's 11.", "Yeah I'm just shocked that she doesn't know yet. They will definitely need professional help, especially since she already has anxiety at 11 years old. That poor girl."]}
