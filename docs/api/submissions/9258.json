When my partner tells me we need to stick to a routine for the little ones I don't even think to deviate from it without checking with her because it is her who has to deal with the repercussions. Hopefully this will give him a kick up the arse to see how big a deal this is and grow a spine and say no to his mummy and daddy.", "YTA. I bet the kids and in-laws are thrilled you are gone. You seem like an angry fun-sucker outer. These grandparents visit rarely. Let them have fun. Hire a cleaning lady if you need to. Relax a little. You are taking a break from your chores, but the kids can't? You sound like the DIL from Hell.", "To invite his parents for a few weeks who see this as a hotel with full service and doesn't want to lift a finger and he is at work the whole day... So who spend the whole day with the parents and is expected to cater all their needs (additional to the childcare that gets ruined by them and the household that gets harder because of them)? He just comes home in the evening to have fun. Now OP left and he finally sees a part of all the stuff she has done. \n\nNTA Please don't give in. He couldn't handle two fucking days. But he now has the weekend to tidy up the whole house! He needs to learn what you do the whole day and what a burden his parents are!", "This was my thought. He\u2019s a parent, he should be able to run the household. It\u2019s ridiculous he isn\u2019t.", ">I'm surprised you haven't divorced him yet.\n\nYou need to chill out lmao. This post features some of the most basic of marital conflicts. You'd expect that a married couple with children would be mature enough to try to reach a compromise first.", "how is she depriving them?  she said the kids are having a blast and can do whatever they want with the gparents, no chores or bedtimes so they're actually getting MORE time with them", "There has to be a balance. Not all the rules can go out the window. If the grandparents are visiting during the school year for a few weeks, things like homework need to be done before the fun stuff can be done. OP can relax chore requirements and still have some there. The problem is that homework isn\u2019t getting done at all, the emphasis is just on fun stuff.", "This. Wish my parents were fun grandparents like your ILs.  Had to keep them away from my kids because they sound just like OP. It's a few times a year. Deal with it.", "Oh man this is brutal. I don\u2019t even have kids and I know schedules are meant to be followed and not a suggestion. This was an epic move and seriously so much respect that you did that \u270a", "Can you suggest that they visit in the school holidays instead?", "Seriously? And you can't even relax the \"rules\" a little when they come? Stop being such a tyrant and let life be fun for their visit.", "Then they are only allowed during school holidays or not at all!! Your husband and in-laws are idiots!! Nta", "\" You'd expect that a married couple with children would be mature enough to try and reach compromise first.\"\n\nDid we read the same post? She's BEEN trying to reach compromise already. She's been TALKING until she literally had to resort to leaving her home to make a point. It's absolutely preposterous a grown man refuses to reel in HIS parents. Yeah, absolutely throw the whole man away.", "So this is isn't actually about the kids then. This is about OP.", "Except the kids do have rules, except for a couple of times a year. I feel bad for the kids whose parents can't compromise over minor things because rules have to be absolute, for some reason. And yes, sleeping schedules are a minor thing in this scenario.", "Oh no. She does not have to pick up a damn thing. They can clean up the mess themselves.", "Three adults? You are too generous, it's five kids home alone over there ;)", "Agree! I understand that when family/special people are visiting, your routine/schedule may go out the window for perhaps a few hours or an afternoon or the whole weekend (at least that\u2019s what happened with us when family from o/s stayed with us), but to expect an \u201canything goes\u201d time for the host family who is not on vacation and especially the children, who need to do homework and to sleep, is ridiculous.\n\nI\u2019m sure if they allowed the routine to continue as is, there would still be a little time for bonding- maybe not a whole hockey game or movie but definitely a little something each day (heck they could even help do the chores together).\n\nInstead they\u2019ve created this big mess where everything is now out of order and nothing is getting done. Good on OP for taking herself out of there and making them deal with the mess they created!", "Thats a good ideia but there should stil be some rules.", "Compromise means both parties have to sacrifice something and meet in the middle. What has OP done to try to meet in the middle?", "Is it fair to the kids when it was their grandparents fault?", "It makes for a good life lesson. This is what happens when we all stop doing our part and our chores. This is why we keep to a schedule and do a little bit every day.", "Fair? Fair? Is It fair to OP that she's the only adult in that house? Is it fair that all the emotional labor is on her? Get out of here with your fair.", "The life lesson would work just as well if they do some but mum helps? Then the life lesson is \"this is why we do a bit every day but when it's not your fault it doesn't get done I will help you fix things.\" But I guess it won't do them any harm either. Just not how I would do it.", "Probably not how she is going to do it either, but she will want them to start and maybe her helping, as opposed to \"now that you are finally back you can clean up our mess\""]}
