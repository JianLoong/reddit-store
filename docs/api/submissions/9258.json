I reminded my husband that our son had chores to do and homework.  He said it was just a hockey game.  \n\nI told the kids to get their stuff.

He needs to realise exactly how unfair he is being to OP, and start working with her as a team player.", "Why should she be the witch that separates a grandparents from their children? \n\nLet the husband come to that decision. \n\nIf they come visit, she can just go visit her parents again! Honestly it's a great policy to have year around.", "Many do. Falling in love with the wrong person is the best way to make life difficult and it's hard to walk away, even when you know you should, once you're in love. Women can mess up a man pretty good too but I agree that it does seem like there's a lot of men who aren't pulling their weight in the household and to top it off aren't appreciating the person who is.", "When they are told they that the kids need to do their homework/chores then yes, it is on them to stop demanding time with them. And the fact that staying for weeks at a time means they more than likely would have picked up on their schedules. and then lets not forget that they started to berate OP when she took the kids to her parents. I highly doubt she did not tell them why. \n\nYes, the husband should be saying no, but the grandparents should not be asking once they were told about the issues they were causing", "School is mandatory and free of charge (in France). I don't find it oppressive. That way every child can get an education, even if some parents have other priorities (primary like bad parents). When a kid miss school on regularly basis, there is financial consequences for the parents and CPS is called. \nI think it's a cultural difference. I just can't think at the presence at school being optional.", "It's not bleak or oppressive. When I was a kid we lived for a number of years in a different country to the rest of my family. Pre-internet, and phone calls were expensive, so we only saw them during holidays or when they were able to visit us. We never skipped school for a vacation. My childhood was great, with plenty of favourite memories. Sorry if you wouldn't have been able to handle not going on vacation during school time?\n\nStructure and routine are important for kids, including school. Also, you try organising a whole school full of kids if everyone can just choose to dip out when grandma comes to visit for a week's vacation.", ">OP does need to say this, her husband does.\n\nBut he won't. It's infuriating how some men want to act like they aren't responsible for anything they've created or contribute to the well being of their life.", "I know. Everyone is applauding OP for doing nothing. \n\nAnd then telling her to be the bad guy again by setting up boundaries when she tried!", "But making those boundaries  will make OP the bad guy. The husband needs to come up with those boundaries and suffer the consequences when the come to visit.", "Five or six times a year for *multiple weeks on end* no less! It's absolutely ridiculous that they think rules go out the window when they visit that much. I'd still think it was *wrong* but I could understand the thought if they only visited one week a year, or every few years. But at least one week (and frequently more) every other month? Hell no.", "Especially since it seems like they show up whenever they want to, and expect they can turn it into a \u201chave fun with the grandkids\u201d week irrespective of whatever else may be going on. And expect OP to keep things going even as they destroy any semblance of control she had over things.", "hey friendo, fancy seeing you here! Anyways I agree that once you give into your boundaries it's a downward slope from there and you need to form some sort of backbone.", "Because they want to see the kids, not spend the whole day with the kids.", "Sounds like OP is American, where school holidays are limited to about 10 days at Christmas, a week in March, the odd day off here and there, and a long summer. School holidays in other parts of the world are much more balanced through the year.", ">Many do. Falling in love with the wrong person is the best way to make life difficult and it's hard to walk away, even when you know you should\n\nA-fucking-men.", "I guarantee you that if the husband & wife were a united front on this issue, then the grandparents would fall into line. It's natural for grandparents to want to spoil grandkids. Part of being the parent is doing the hard work of saying no. It may not be fair, but nobody ever said life was supposed to be fair.", "I'm in Canada, school is free here too. \n\nIf a child misses an excessive amount of school, yeah, CPS gets involved as the school would report it. Otherwise, parents are allowed to decide if their child needs a day off or not. There are plenty of systems in place to ensure that kids get a proper education. \n\nPresence at school isn't really 'optional'. It is still la legal requirement for children to attend school.  Parents just don't need permission to take them out here and there and don't need to give an explicit reason and are trusted to make the best decisions for their children.", "I mean, I don't think the entirety of kids in Canada lack routine and structure. I missed 5 days of school every other year to go on a trip with my family. I wasn't dissapearing for months at a time lol. I turned out pretty okay.  It seems to work out fine in my country at least, so I'm not sure what the last part of your comment even means. There aren't multiple kids off on vacation at any given time. \n\n\nI suppose oppressive is a strong word, but yeah, it is definitely strange to me that you need permission from your government to take your child out of primary school for a single day or two.\n\nWe also don't 'skip' school. Our parents tell the school how long we'll be absent and are sent home with schoolwork for that period of time, if it's a pre planned trip.", "Exactly! The entitlement of these people and why isn't the husband doing... anything? I can't wrap my head around these fathers. I'm a dad and I'm so involved with everything with  my son, housework, etc. My wife is amazing and we are true partners but some of these dads disgust me.", "Right, that's kinda insane! \"About half the months of the year, they're here for about half a month. Sounds like it would be better with normal scheduled visits so you can plan the year lol", "> I'm not sure what the last part of your comment even means. There aren't multiple kids off on vacation at any given time.\n\nIf kids are allowed to just skip school for a vacation, then there *can* be multiple kids off at any given time. If one parent can pull their kid out for a week's vacation, so can others, yes, including at the same time. \n\nAnd we don't check with \"the government\" if a kid needs to miss school for pre-planned circumstances/events. The *school* is informed; my parents did it when I took music exams, or went to funerals, doctors' appointments etc.  \n\nI also have teachers in my family though, so skipping school for fun times just wasn't a thing we did. Teachers can't just take a holiday in term time, so their kids don't. \n\nI'm in the UK. One of the many metrics school inspectors judge schools on is attendance. \n\nI didn't mean the entirety of kids in your country lack routine and structure. I was simply trying to show that it's not \"oppressive\" or \"bleak\" just because our experience is *different* to yours, and that maybe you might want to consider the ridiculousness of judging an entire country/culture on that basis."]}
