Hey husband's parents live a couple of states away and only see the kids a few times a year. \n\nIt's easy when we go see them since we only visit when the kids are off school.  \n\nBut when they come see us it is at random intervals through the year.  \n\nNot a problem really they are excellent grandparents.  With one small exception. They think our rules go out the window when they visit.  \n\nIt's mean that we don't make the kids their favorite food every day.  Why can't the kids watch tv with them before they do their chores and homework.  Why do the kids have to be in bed so early.  \n\nIt drives me crazy that I'm the bad guy because my husband won't put his foot down so I have to do it.  \n\nThey came last week.  On Monday ss soon as dinner was over they wanted the kids to pay attention to them. They wanted to take the kids to see Avatar.  On a school night.  My husband allowed it.  \n\nLast straw.  I told him that he knew that throwing the kids off there schedule screwed me over.  So I gave him the choice of either enforcing our rules or I would.  He said he would take care of it.  \n\nSecond night there was a hockey game on.  He wanted to watch it with our son who loves hockey.  I reminded my husband that our son had chores to do and homework.  He said it was just a hockey game.  \n\nI told the kids to get their stuff.  I took them and a change of clothes and their homework to my parents house.  My mom and dad will watch them and then take them to school in the morning.  \n\nI went back home and they were waiting for me.  I'm being a controlling and abusive person by denying them time with the kids. I'm not the only person allowed to make decisions regarding the kids.  They came all this way to see them and I'm being a jerk by keeping them on a schedule.  \n\nFine.  They are visiting for a couple of weeks.  Wednesday after I picked up the kids from school and dropped them off at home with my in-laws. Then I went out for the first time in ages.  I told my husband I would be out late and didn't want to wake anyone so I would be at my parents house.  \n\nDid the same thing Thursday through tonight.  My husband has been calling and texting and coming over to tell me I need to come home because the house is a disaster because his parents won't do anything.  They are in vacation and they are there to see the kids not clean up.  The kids are having a fun time with no rules and he has been contacted by the school because no homework was turned in on Thursday or Friday.  I didn't answer those texts.  \n\nI said I would be back after his parents left or he enforced the rules.  He said I was taking it too far and that it was affecting his work.

So many women take this kind of shit and never have the guts to stand up for themselves.  Playing nice sucks!!!  Husband and parents will most likely call you difficult.  They are upset the house is a mess?  They can clean it themselves! You are not the maid and you were not put on this earth to ensure everyone has a lovely time but you.  YOU are the one that has to take of the aftermath.  If your husband and his parents can\u2019t understand that children need routine and boundaries, you are in for a hell of a rough ride.  Hopefully you\u2019ve made it well known that you won\u2019t stand for that type of sh**.", "NTA. She asked them politely to respect the weekday rules and everyone ignored you. Sure, the Grandparents are on holiday but noone else is. Plus I love the ultra pettiness of you going out/to your parents to let them all fend for themselves! They don't wanna abide by the rules, they can do all the homeworks and chores themselves. Legend!", "NTA. He wants to let his parents have their way in your house. That is not okay.  You guys probably have a good reason for the way that you handle things. If he can't understand that then just stay with your folks whenever his visit.  Although I do wonder what you mean by they are \"excellent\" grandparents. They sound like entitled asshole boomers but must be younger.", "NTA. Good for you. Your husband fucked around and found out.", "NTA-I\u2019m so sorry for you. The only compromise I can think of doesn\u2019t apply immediately. Your husband has to say no when they want to visit during school weeks. Will he limit visits to long weekends or holidays? \n\nYou may need to answer your husband. Maybe something like, \u201cYou allowed this to happen, so now you have to deal with the consequences. I can\u2019t handle it-I tried, and it resulted in you lying to me & your parents going off on me. It\u2019s too stressful for me, so i\u2019ll be home when they leave.\u201d \n\nQuestion: who is getting the calls from the school? Do they call him or you?", "NTA. It seems like everyone\u2019s expectation is that when things get tough, you\u2019ll step in and pick up the slack, and they don\u2019t have to. It also seems like your husband would rather do *anything* then stand up to his parents. You made your position clear. When your requirements weren\u2019t met, you solved the problem yourself. When that proved unpalatable, you brought the kids back and said \u201cI\u2019m done, you solve it\u201d. The fact that this is impacting your husband\u2019s job is unfortunate, but is something he should have anticipated when he completely ignored your warnings and concerns.", "NTA he doesn\u2019t want to be an enforcer and wants you to look like the bad guy all the time.  He needs to parent.", "Sometimes to make an omelette you have to kill the chicken.\n\nOr something like that \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThey visit, but it's not just for a day or two but for several weeks. That's too long for an \"exceptional\" status, especially when the kids have school and everyone needs to go to work. \n\nI admire your determination. You absolutely did the right thing, imho.", "NTA Good on you for standing up for yourself. The grandparents should respect the rules you as parents have for your children, and your husband shouldn't skip out on parental responsibilities like that and make you the bad guy, because he can't stand up to his parents.", "NTA, you tried to get him to listen, when he didn't you showed him why he needs to. I'm sure he's now learnt his lesson.", "NTA -  Enjoy your vacation!", "\"Honestly tough shit\" is right. NTA\n\nPersonally I relax the rules around stuff like snacks and TV when grandparents are there, but I have the last word and I would be furious to be overruled. Shrugging off the homework is unacceptable. Don't go home. Let your husband learn how to be a parent.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Your husband is only getting what he deserves for not supporting you.  He can deal with the school, he can do the chores that the kids aren't doing, he can deal with his parents until they leave.  Take a nice break, do some of the things you have been wanting to but haven't been able to like maybe catching up with friends etc.", "I love this.", "Bravo, and NTA.", "NTA", "Did you make the rules or did you make the rules together?

It's a few weeks a year and they are excellent grandparents in other aspects.  You don't have to accept all the good stuff, but of course you do for your kids sake.  So you could accept what comes with it.  Go, take a break anywhere you want, but you're not taking a break, you're trying to be controlling from afar since you can't influence or negotiate in the moment.", "NTA! From one woman to another, I\u2019m so proud of you!!", "The kids have chores.  But they aren't doing them.  And they are spending ba lot of money on delivery since I'm not there to cook and getting the kids to prep.  I'm wondering how much food I'm going to have to toss when I get home.", "They honestly love the kids and provide them with some awesome experiences and gifts that are out of our budget right now.  They are putting money into their education funds and a fund to help them get started in life afterwards.  They do a lot for us.

You\u2019re going to have to pick up the pieces after all of this.  They might not learn their lesson and you STILL have extra work to do.  There\u2019s 3 adults - can\u2019t one of them put together a meal?  They\u2019re just being lazy and expecting you to do everything for them.  You are not the hired help.  They should treat you as such.  I\u2019d be FUMING!", "Fine. They are okay grandparents but they sound like bad parents and insufferable in-laws.", "Perfect. At least he\u2019s getting that info directly. Good luck. I\u2019m sorry for the mess you\u2019re likely inherit when they leave. \n\nI hope the kids are young enough that this doesn\u2019t become long-term learned behavior.

I meant re-establishing the routine. \n\nMy husband was the enforcer of the routine in our home (I worked evenings). For the instances I was home, it was awkward for me, bc I didn\u2019t really know how to pitch in well. He handled HW, baths, & bedtime for our kids.", "They live in their motorhome mostly."]}
