Henna is something anyone can wear but is usually reserved for exactly the type of situation you were in-weddings!\nIt's completely appropriate for you to wear it, especially if your stepmother asked you to have it done and organised it as it is a traditional part of her culture. Being lighter has nothing to do with anything. Lots of Muslims are white and even when people convert to Islam they are called \"reverts\" and not converts as Muslims believe everyone is born under Allah/islam and it's when you choose to accept that and follow Islam that you come BACK to being a Muslim, not become one for the first time. This person is just being an AH for the sake of it.\n\nMy best friend is Muslim, I'm a lesbian and she has offered more than once to do my mendhi/henna when I get married as its NOT a religious thing, purely cultural and traditional-lots of AH gatekeeping types like to forget they are different.", "When people say cultural appropriation I automatically know they are a bag of drama.\n\nNTA", "NTA. in my experience, Indians love it when people participate in their culture enthusiastically and with joy. it's not inappropriate.", "Absolutely NTA. Please go to HR and report her for creating a hostile work environment because she\u2019s being an AH.\n\nGrowing up we had henna all the time (I\u2019m Hindu) and our local Hindu organization would even do henna tattoos at the weekly market night in our city and people loved it!

H doesn\u2019t have to like it or agree with is, it\u2019s none of her business.  You are trying to learn about the culture and H is making this a problem for no good reason.", "Nta that's an hr complaint. You had it done, as part of a BRIDAL party at the request of the bride who is now your *step mom*.\n\nWho the fuck does H think she is to go around saying your step mom isn't Muslim enough or dark enough???? for henna at her wedding.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHenna is a cultural practice of many cultures, anyone can wear it.  It's not tied to religion and doesn't necessarily require a special event.  \n\nYou aren't in the wrong, even if you weren't specifically invited to participate by someone of that culture.", "NTA, The attitude your coworker is showing is called colorism. Who is she to say that your stepmom is not Muslim enough to have henna. That's absurd. I would go to your HR and file a complaint for workplace harassment and creating a toxic work environment.", "H needs to learn what cultural appropriation is. You didn't steal from her culture. You're not pretending it's yours. \n\nYou had henna done as part of a Muslim wedding, which is normal. And it's a beautiful, traditional art that everyone should be able to enjoy! I've lived in the middle east. We had henna done at school festivals, it was just a cool thing everyone did to celebrate. No one was checking our credentials to see if we were \"allowed\" to wear henna.\n\nThe real kicker is that she thinks she gets to gatekeep what other Muslim women wear (your stepmom's hijab). That right there tells you everything you need to know about her. NTA", "NTA; H is being obnoxious.  You are respecting your stepmothers traditions and embracing her as family in doing so.\n\nH may respectfully find a corner or hill to die on somewhere else.", "NTA. My husband is Indian and I am white. We had henna at our wedding at my mother in law\u2019s insistence. It was beautiful and an artistic reminder of the wedding. You\u2019re not appropriating anything if it was part of the ceremony. It doesn\u2019t just \u201cwash off\u201d either so anyone telling you to do that doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.", "Henna is not used just by Muslims. I'm Indian and I've had it done several times\n\nAlso if H knew anything he'd know you can't just wash it off. \n\nBut you need to get in front of this to HR. Explain your side calmly and rationally. Mention H was making many assumptions about you and your family and was making demands about your bodily autonomy\n\nNTA", "As an Indian, it\u2019s not cultural appropriation. And if H knew anything about \u201cher culture\u201d she would know Henna doesn\u2019t wash out when you wash your hand.\nNTA", "H really should learn what \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d actually is before throwing out egregious accusations. \n\nNTA. As others have suggested, please make a record of H\u2019s harassment with HR as soon as you can. H clearly doesn\u2019t understand the terms she is using and there\u2019s no telling what else she might twist, or just get wrong, and accuse you of. Maybe HR should send her on a training course or two to learn about the actual definition of cultural appropriation. Good luck!", "NTA and I would let HR know you were only honoring YOUR family members culture with that henna and did not mean to offend that one coworker.", "NTA\n\nI am an Indian, we use henna in our culture as well. \n\nI will give you my permission to do as many hennas as you want. \n\nNow this won't be culture appropriation.", "Nta. It was put on by your new relative. She doesnt own henna art. More than muslims do it as well.  Some people go out of their way to be a victim or be offended.  \"My stepmom did it to welcome me into her culture\" is enough.  Even if you got a henna dolphin at great adventure it isn't appropriation. Temporary body art is universal. Its not very muslim of her to act like that as well. If she makes another rude remark about you being accepted into your new family members culture, complain to your boss or hr about discrimination.  It's possibly her being mad about your stepmom marrying outside her race/culture/religion.", "NTA. Wearing henna at the request of a Muslim bride for a wedding with nods to Muslim culture is not cultural appropriation. It is simply participating in the culture in the way it was intended. Your coworker is trying to police how Muslim your stepmom is? That's not cool. The concept of cultural appropriation doesn't mean no one is ever allowed to participate in the rituals of another culture. It means you shouldn't misuse the culture for your own gain or disrespect it by using it as a fashion trend. That's not what you were doing. Also it was none of her business. If you see someone wearing henna, there's a decent chance it was from a wedding, which is obviously fine. And no one has the right to interrogate or attack you for that.", "NTA, I went to my friends Indian wedding and my wife also participated alongside most of the Indian women getting henna. Celebrating and following the traditions of another culture is part of respecting it. Don't let this ninny rain on your experience. If she were Christian she'd be protesting military funerals ;)", "Girl, NTA. As someone from India (born there) what you did was absolutely not cultural appropriation. You were invited to participate in cultural practices by someone engaging in them. H is overreacting. Sure, you could explain to her that your father has recently married a Muslim woman and you were invited to participate in cultural aspects of the Nikkah by her, but H seems to be the kind of person who\u2019d just find something else to be offended by. \n\nWhat I would do though is bring it up with your works HR department as a CYA measure. That H is harassing you and spreading rumours and lies about you. That way it\u2019s on paper, and HR sometimes tends to side with the person who went to them first.", "Please update after you talk to HR. They had better back you up on this!", "NTA.\n\nH is gatekeeping religion. Muslims don't have to be follow her exact interpretation and observation in order to be worthy of sharing their religious and cultural traditions with their step-daughter.\n\nReport H to HR. This is religious discrimination.", "This is so American. Where I'm from you can get henna easily. Heck you can even buy a tube and draw on yourself. Also, Hindus do it as well, it's not a Muslim thing strictly!", "NTA.  It's lovely that you are forming a friendship with E.  Lots of non-Muslims have henna art applied simply because they like the look.  Also, whether H likes it or not, only time will erase the henna.  If you are in a job that has a shop steward, take them with you to the HR meeting.", "There is appropriation and appreciation, and you were invited to participate in a significant cultural event with family! Imagine if H just did her job and minded her own business. You cannot tell me she has not been to weddings with guests from other cultures who were asked to participate in the events of the day. NTA.", "Ok. I am white af and raised catholic as well but I am going to go with NTA. \n\nFrom what I learned about cultural appropriation, it is when someone out of a culture, take bits from said culture out of context (so trivialisation), don't give credit where it's due and usually try to make cash out of it (not all the time but usually).\n\nHere, you were invited by someone from the culture to do something with them and partake in it. And for your coworker to judge your stepmom relation to her religion? Like what, the coworker's the muslim police?\n\nNope. NTA and when you do meet with HR, I hope you'll give them your 2 cents about this whole ordeal.", "NTA\u2014this shouldn\u2019t even BE an issue at work. Is it hindering your ability to do your job? Absolutely not.", "At my work I work with Indian women and they have applied Henna to my hands, and I\u2019m white as hell. They were happy to share it and were the ones to offer it!", "She got a cultural *invitation*.", "Seriously. I have a work friend who is Hindi. When she got married she invited all of us to the evening when all the women got henna and encouraged us to participate", "But E isn't pure Muslim so apparently she shouldn't be using henna either... /s", "My sister-in-law married a man from India whose family practices Hindu.

Maybe I will now.", "Please follow up and (if possible) name names. It's important to document bad behavior.\n\nYou may want to consult an attorney, as this is harassment. The firm should have dismissed it out of hand.", "She just mad at her and is using her \"culture\" against her.", "Hey man I don\u2019t want to come across rude, but I just wanna say, there\u2019s no such thing as being Hindi. You can be Hindu or Indian, but it\u2019s a common mistake to call someone Hindi. That\u2019s a language. Love that you got to participate in someone\u2019s henna ceremony/party though! They\u2019re super fun \u270c\ud83c\udffd", "Just FYI it's practicing Hinduism, and they are Hindus!", "And is that not the difference in appreciation of another culture and not appropriation? \nIntent? Positive intent = good, negative intent = bad.", "NTA. You were invited to share in this by the bride who is part of the culture. Plus the original plant was found and practice started in Egypt. It has been shared to many different cultures since which I believe only solidifies how NTA you are. It has been shared forever, wear it without shame!", "E was wearing the hijab? Why would E wear the hijab if she's not Muslim??", "Like the second ceremony we were just there for the ceremony, sat in the middle, then afterwards the great uncle brought us around a little to say congrats to the couple & we left (didn't go to that dinner, also not sure if the couple knew we were going to be there?) BUT he paid us with a goodie box each of the dessert selection! So yay? XD", "Man, I always get these mixed up for some reason.", "You are correct. I should read my comments before I hit post.", "Will you by any chance be willing to post an update afterwards? I hope your colleague gets owned. NTA", "Oh, please!  Provide us an update after you educate HR and H about henna traditions.  I hope you insist that H apologize to you as her conduct qualifies as harassment.  Good Luck!", "To the best of my understanding, henna tats are often worn in celebration of a wedding, and they\u2019re often shared with at least members of the wedding party and/or the family.  I utterly fail to see how you can be trivalizing H\u2019s culture when you\u2019re wearing henna for the usual reasons it\u2019s worn in that culture.", "Oooo I went for a whole three day extravaganza and received multiple goodie boxes, none of which could we finish before having to leave (the country). It was a trip. \n\nI was much more active as a colleague of the groom and was dancing up a storm - great music.", "This is masterful.  OP, listen to this post ^^^^^ here! (Except obvs for the bit about your stepmum being your sister )", "\"Too white to be Muslim\"? WTF? I suppose H has never hear of Bosnia.", "You genius, that response is perfect. I hope OP memorizes it for her HR meeting!", "I realise that, but H has made this about religion.\n\nA complaint like this, you do not allow religious or racial problems to fall on yourself.   OP\u2019s best option is to immediately and with great vehemence point out how H is being discriminatory.", "Agree with this and they don\u2019t even need a \u201cceremony,\u201d per se.  I\u2019m Indian and \u201cwhenever I feel like it\u201d is henna time, and I\u2019ve invited my American girlfriends to accompany me if they so wish.", "We had henna at our school walkathon last month. We have a very large Indian community and moms volunteered to do it just like people volunteered to do face painting.", "Whoops!   Thanks for pointing that out.  Edited :)", "Oh of course! I don't disagree with you. Just wanted to clarify that H doesn't have a leg to stand on here if she's making accusations of religious bigotry or appropriation. \n\nBut you're absolutely right!"]}
