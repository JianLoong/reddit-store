This was something special they could share with non-Muslims and others outside their culture.  It created bonds and was something awesome to share. Hoya also taught me how to wrap a Hijab (which came in handy with the younger girls who chose to wear one). Hoya would also bring me a anjaro and odca (which I'm sure I'm spelling it totally wrong as my Somali/Arabic is really rusty) and the AMAZING saffron rice.
