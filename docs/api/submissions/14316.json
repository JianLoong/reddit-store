Tina is significantly overweight and well on her way to becoming obese, and I\u2019ve noticed her parents (both also overweight) have not taught her proper nutrition and portion control. She\u2019s always the first to reach for a cookie or a donut, and consume three times as much as most kids her age. I feel sorry for her because it seems it isn\u2019t her fault she is overweight but her parents\u2019 fault, and I worry she will develop severe weight issues later in life.\n\nAt the sleepover party, I decided I was going to try to monitor her portions and nutrition as much as possible. We ordered pizza for dinner, and I imposed a two slice limit, knowing none of Lily\u2019s other friends would eat more, but Tina was begging for a third piece and I said no. Then, for cake I cut everyone a small piece, and again this wasn\u2019t a problem for anyone but Tina was really upset and on the verge of tears. For breakfast I imposed similar limits, and when Tina\u2019s parents picked her up I heard her say, \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d\n\nI understand it would be a problem if I let everyone else eat whatever they want and ONLY limited Tina\u2019s portions, but that was not the case. Tina just was the only one who wanted to exceed the limits. However, later I got a call from Tina\u2019s mom calling me fatphobic and telling me it\u2019s not my job to parent her child. This ticked me off. I could have said, \u201cIt\u2019s your job, but you\u2019re not doing it, so somebody else has to,\u201d but I just politely explained to her that her daughter had to follow the same rules as all the other girls and hung up.\n\nMy husband got home later that day though and after I explained what happened he said I could relax a little since it is a birthday party afterall. We went back and forth for a bit, but the point that stuck with me was that while I held *everyone* to the limits I put, I DID set them specifically with Tina in mind and with the assumption (which held true) that only Tina would want to eat more.

Especially since it was a sleepover. If you'd have 2-hour party and you didn't serve enough food to satisfy one guest's appetite, she could have at least gone home immediately afterwards and had something else to fill herself up.  \n\nTina's appetite control, or lack thereof is none of your business.  And restricting her for 1 day isn't going to have any kind of positive impact on her life.  You just invited a child to your daughter's birthday party and chose to make her miserable.  How positively inhospitable of you!", ">I understand it would be a problem if I let everyone else eat whatever they want and ONLY limited Tina\u2019s portions, but that was not the case. \n\nBut that is exactly what you did.

It's very obvious you were purposely only \"protecting\" her. \n\nIf you were actually concerned about nutrition and portion control,  you would have served a more balanced meal than pizza and cake.

So this was a pointless exercise.\n\n(2) I don't think imposing limits is bad, if, say, there was only enough pizza ordered for every kid to have 2 slices.  But if there was leftover pizza, you should have given anyone who asked a little more.\n\n(3) Why are you fighting with Tina's mom, and throwing insults?!?\n\nI don't really care too much about this \"fatphobia\" thing.  You didn't teach Tina anything about health or nutrition.

You are NOT Tina's parent, and it is NOT your job to parent the child.\n\nYou have no idea what could be going on. Yes, you see her eat food that you determine to be unhealthy. Every child does, at some point or another. But is there a medical reason for her weight? Is there a reason her parents aren't addressing the nutrition, OR are they addressing the nutrition privately in their own way in their own home but not making that info public?\n\nWhat it comes down to is, we're talking about a nine-year-old child who is hungry. If there's a child at my kid's birthday party who is hungry, I'm going to feed them. If it bothered me that much WHAT they were eating, I would offer healthy options: fruit, veggie sticks, low sugar fruit juice ice pops, etc. But it's a birthday party, let 'em be kids.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2018re not her parent.

How can one night being denied food teach a child good eating habits? It can't, especially without an explanation.  You failed to teach her anything about healthy eating.

You know absolutely NOTHING about Tina's health or her family life. Her doctor knows. Her parents know. You do not. \n\n2. You've assumed, since Tina's parents are fat, that they are lazy and uneducated about food choices and portion control. You know NOTHING about the health of Tina's parents AND you equate being fat to eating crap and not knowing when to stop. Ironically most larger people don't overeat, and size doesn't equate to health. I've known skinny people who were massively unhealthy and plus size women who could run rings around them. \n\n3. I guarantee you that EVERYONE at the party knew why this limit was in place and I would bet that Tina's tears were from this embarrassment rather than anything else. It's pretty clear that she and her mother knew why you put restrictions in place. \n\n4. Most importantly, it is not your place to parent another child. At all. She's not hurting other children. She's not rude, destructive, or engaging in dangerous behaviors like sex, drugs, or rock and roll (/s). She wanted an extra slice of pizza for crying out loud, but being fat is the worst thing you can be in your version of this world so far be it from you to let that go. If you still can't see why YTA here, how would you feel if your daughter went to a sleepover and that parent limited what the children did because they thought they knew best for your kid?\n\nYou are 1,000% fat phobic and you need to call Tina's mother and apologize profusely.

And you made her ask you for food and denied her. \n\n3) her friends absolutely understood what you were doing and why.

You are not Tina's parent or her doctor.  Your behaviour is completely inappropriate.", "YTA. No matter how much you rightly disagree with Tina's parents feeding her the way they do, targeting the kid does not help. Wriggling out of it by justifying that you portion controlled everyone just because you wanted to limit Tina's portion sizes in a roundabout way makes you the AH. Not to mention that limiting the kid's portion size once does nothing to reduce weight - it needs to be reinforced at home. An obese child does not understand why they are hungry: they are used to more food, and you limiting food quantity at one meal does not do anything to set **consistent** boundaries anyway. \n\nIf you were concerned about the kids eating junk at all, which is completely fair, you could have gone to the effort to make them healthy snacks/healthy food. There are so many delicious kid friendly snacks like fruit or ants on a log. Homemade pizza is healthier than the restaurant stuff. They could even have helped you set the table or make the food.

What did you expect to achieve by doing this?  Did you think she would wake up and start eating better because of this one night?  I have extremely thin daughters.

You are not Tina\u2019s mother or doctor. You don\u2019t know if she has a medical condition or if she is genetically predisposed to obesity. What\u2019s more, she is 9 years old and probably going through or about to go through puberty where it\u2019s normal to feel more hungry. Also, portioned eating isn\u2019t necessarily healthy eating and it often leads to disordered eating. Instead of limiting slices of pizza you could\u2019ve also offered fruits and vegetables in addition to the pizza. If I were you I would apologize profusely to Tina and her mom. I\u2019d also apologize to your daughter because it\u2019s possible she will lose a friend because of your actions and that is sad to me.", "your reasoning kinda makes you the asshole", "YTA", "YTA\u2014it\u2019s the judgement for me! You are projecting your own fear of weight gain onto a child. When you invite children into your home, you are agreeing to help them feel as comfortable as possible. This means letting them eat until they are full. For some, alcohol is comfort. For others, binge-watching tv. Maybe it\u2019s chocolate. For this kiddo, it\u2019s eating.\n\nAcceptance of your child\u2019s friends is also so important for your own child. Showing that you can compassionately interact with the people she chooses to bring into her life is how you show her how to nurture and be a friend. \n\nYou also have no idea what this child feats at home. Genetics play a huge role in weight gain. Food also isn\u2019t just sustenance. It\u2019s how we interact, how we bond, how we relate to other people.\n\nAnd, as an aside, eating copious amounts of junk food at a sleepover was pure bliss and everyone did it. Once in middle school, my friend and I ate a huge container of cupcake gold fish which we dipped in chocolate frosting (which we also finished). We did this after eating bread bowls.

The bigger a kid is in either direction, the more calories they're going to need because they just have more body. If Tina was a foot taller but skinnier, or going through a growth spurt, would you have still limited her?\n\nAnd yes I know height and weight aren't a perfect comparison, but OP only had Tina for one night, so (as everyone else has said) it's not like she made a big impact on Tina's possible health problems.

This child was not singled out, she was not \"starving\" at any point and even at a birthday party foods like pizza, donuts, cake, etc. should be controlled within reason by the adult in charge. I don't even know why this is controversial especially since it's your house. Even when it comes to Trick-Or-Treating on Halloween I would say it's completely reasonable to place limits on how much candy the kids can eat in a day. Likewise, when my kids friends would come over for sleepovers they were all subject to the same rules. They all ate what we ate, in the portions that were given to them, they all followed the same curfew for being outside after dark and at a certain age I would approve any videos they decided to watch. It's not always fun being a responsible adult but that's just how it works, especially with younger children.  \n\nPeople on this thread can call me \"fatphobic\" all they want but I see the long term effects of obesity every day and while people should not be bullied for their weight or have unrealistic body standards placed on them it's still a significant health issue which can't be swept under the rug. I'm sure this take isn't popular but we'll see if anyone can provide a good counterargument to my reasoning.", "YTA\nI understand you're coming from a place of wanting what's best for this kid, but you don't get to choose that.

Tina is significantly overweight and well on her way to becoming obese, and I\u2019ve noticed her parents (both also overweight) have not taught her proper nutrition and portion control. She\u2019s always the first to reach for a cookie or a donut, and consume three times as much as most kids her age. I feel sorry for her because it seems it isn\u2019t her fault she is overweight but her parents\u2019 fault, and I worry she will develop severe weight issues later in life.\n\nAt the sleepover party, I decided I was going to try to monitor her portions and nutrition as much as possible. We ordered pizza for dinner, and I imposed a two slice limit, knowing none of Lily\u2019s other friends would eat more, but Tina was begging for a third piece and I said no. Then, for cake I cut everyone a small piece, and again this wasn\u2019t a problem for anyone but Tina was really upset and on the verge of tears. For breakfast I imposed similar limits, and when Tina\u2019s parents picked her up I heard her say, \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d\n\nI understand it would be a problem if I let everyone else eat whatever they want and ONLY limited Tina\u2019s portions, but that was not the case. Tina just was the only one who wanted to exceed the limits. However, later I got a call from Tina\u2019s mom calling me fatphobic and telling me it\u2019s not my job to parent her child. This ticked me off. I could have said, \u201cIt\u2019s your job, but you\u2019re not doing it, so somebody else has to,\u201d but I just politely explained to her that her daughter had to follow the same rules as all the other girls and hung up.\n\nMy husband got home later that day though and after I explained what happened he said I could relax a little since it is a birthday party afterall. We went back and forth for a bit, but the point that stuck with me was that while I held *everyone* to the limits I put, I DID set them specifically with Tina in mind and with the assumption (which held true) that only Tina would want to eat more. Does that make me the AH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There\u2019s no medical excuse for a child to be morbidly obese. It doesn\u2019t take a doctor to know that. If you think of doctor is necessary in the situation, then you are part of the problem.", "Hang on, you're adding details to the story now right? So you must have first hand knowledge of the kid and her family? So I suppose you must be the pediatrician / nutritionist whose medical advice has been ignored, awesome! Where did you get *your* medical license?", "Actually, there are medical conditions that can cause obesity in children. And the child went home learning nothing other than that her friend\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t care about her.", "What details am I adding?", "Like I said, you people will bend over backwards to try to excuse child abuse. It\u2019s disgusting and vile. This child should be removed from the home and place with parents who can help her make good decisions. A good parent like the OP.", "OP called the parents overweight, you said morbidly obese. I assumed your medical training was kicking in. Question stands.", "I\u2019m sorry, does being overweight preclude you from being morbidly obese? Nice attempt on your part."]}
