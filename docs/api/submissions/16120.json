We had always had a great relationship. We have multiple same interests, and we would go to flea markets, antique shopping, we would go on couples dates to the movies and dinner, and we enjoyed gardening and plants. \nI would like to preface that our styles have never been the same. To our clothing, hairstyles, and even tattoo styles.\nA year ago, I asked my maid of honor and bridesmaids to be in my wedding. I had made cute little boxes with a robe for getting ready the day of, a cut spa candle, customized cup with their names on it, jewelry for the wedding, and a color swatch for the dress. \nI let everyone pick their own dress it just needed to be wedding appropriate, and no excessive cleavage. Then, we would make everything look cohesive with hair, makeup, and accessories. I thought this would be the best and easiest way to do it. I was definitely wrong. \nWe had decided on nude classic shoes. They were still able to choose their own shoes as long as it was a nude, classic shoe. The hair and makeup we chose are classic and elegant. The jewelry had already been purchased and given to them. \nAbout three months ago, everything started to go downhill. First, it was the shoes. She came over one day to \"help\" me with wedding stuff. When she arrived she showed me her shoes for the wedding. They were gladiator style heels. Then she proceeded to tell me that the shoes I had bought for the wedding/ the style I had chosen was a grandma style. \nThen it was the hair. I had posted in the group chat a couple of nice elegant hair style ideas. She proceeded to freak out about and went off on me and the other bridesmaids that she wouldn't be doing any of that \"elegant crap.\" \nThen it was the earrings. The earrings and jewelry that everyone received in their box when they accepted being in the wedding a year ago. She was going to buy a different pair of earrings because she didn't like the style of the earrings. \nLast Wednesday, I was to the point of not caring anymore. I was just tired of arguing about everything. Then Thursday my bridesmaids informed me of several awful things she was saying about my fiance and I. Friday, I kicked her out of the wedding. I had one of my bridesmaids with me when I did it in case it went badly. \nShe went absolutely crazy and blamed me for being a bridezilla and that I'm an asshole for kicking her out of the wedding. \nAITAH?", "created_utc": 1682944121, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134l4ym/aita_for_kicking_my_maid_of_honor_out_of_my/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like she wanted you to kick her out so she didn't have to look bad. I think your requirements sound reasonable, you gave them the jewelry (which she didn't seem to have problems with at the time) and now she's gone full crankypants on you and insulted you and your fianc\u00e9. Good riddance.", "NTA - She knows your style and you have been clear about your vision for the wedding from the start. If she was not willing to adapt to your style for one day, then she should have declined your invite to be in the wedding party.", "NTA it's your wedding, and your style choices; when she gets married, she'll get to have the kind of wedding she wants", "Multiple witnesses to her comments, almost two weeks before the wedding? Too bad. NTA.", "NTA. This is a special day for you. And you bought what they were supposed to wear. The style of the dress and everything else was chosen. And she starts to resent all this? This is very bad.", "NTA \n\nYour wedding, your rules. You were even pretty lenient on those rules. Most brides pick out everything for their bridesmaids.", "NTA\n\nOh, yes, your the zilla with your wild and outrageous demands. Nude shoes? Elegant hairstyles and jewellery? s/\n\nShame on her for throwing away a long term friendship over this.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your wedding. How precious do you have to be about clothes, that you won't wear \"grandma\" heels or \"elegant crap\" for a day because you want to celebrate a friend getting married. If my bestie wanted me to wear a hessan sack to her wedding I'd do it.", "NTA, if there was such a thing as Bridesmaid-zilla she would be it, her constantly nitpicking everything you chose and all the things she has probably said about you and your fiance is what makes HER the A H", "NTA. Rule #1 when planning a wedding: One of your sisters will act like an A-hole from the time you get engaged until after the wedding and you will lose 1-2 friends before it is over. Weddings bring out the worst in some people. She was a major A-hole and the friendship is over. It's not your fault and it was to be expected. Enjoy your wedding.", "NTA, she sounds like a bridesmaid-zilla... She's completely out of line.", "NTA", "NTA I was a bridesmaid in my friend's wedding back in 2019 and initially hated the dresses, both the color and the style (it was a dark, foresty green and the style was very high on the chest and I usually don't like things that close to my neck), but I sucked it up and wore it for my friend's special day. And you know what? That shade of green really brings out my eyes and is now my favorite color, and all of us ended up looking good in the dress, so ultimately I'm glad I broke out of my comfort zone. It's one day and you're really not asking for much!", "NTA - your wedding. You\u2019ve actually been really nice letting the wedding party pick their own stuff. Good riddance to the trash OP. Have the best day.", "NTA, if all you've said is true that's a pretty decent requirement for a bridesmaid. You let them choose their own dress and shoes as long as they fit the style, you provided jewelery and had hair and makeup already planned, that's pretty open as far as bridesmaids requirements go. If its not her style that doesn't matter, it's your wedding and she agreed to be in it so she should have to deal with it.\n\nMaking rude comments about you and your fiance is just the topping on the shit cake and it's good you got rid of her", "NTA. Any woman who accepts an invitation to be in a bridal party knows they\u2019re going to have to make compromises to their typical style on the day of the wedding. The day isn\u2019t about the individuals in the bridal party, it\u2019s about the bride and groom. So we make those compromises with grace and support the bride. If we can\u2019t do those things, we don\u2019t accept the invitation in the first place. At least that\u2019s how I thought it was supposed to go. Your exMOH was the asshole here.", "NTA - There's always two sides to every story, so I'd be curious to hear her side... BUT when you agree to be in a wedding, you are automatically agreeing to go along with what the bride requests for attire. Not sure what her problem is, but it's better to get that negativity out of your wedding party before the big day.", "NTA when you\u2019re a bridesmaid you suck it up even if it\u2019s not your personal style. It\u2019s not like you were asking her to cut hair hair or dye it", "INFO. \n\nWhat exactly did she say? And is there any proof like texts where she said so? \n\nNot saying talking shit about the fiance isn't a dealbreaker. It absolutely is and you're NTA if so. It's a matter of context and proof. Tbh I don't care much about the other details of the dress as much since it seems rather minor", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She kept posting in the group chat that I was going to make her dye her hair and get extensions, and cover her tattoos next (most of my bridesmaids and I have tattoos).\nI was so confused where that came from. \nI know I had said I have to get extensions, but I also have thin hair and I'm wanting old hollywood curls for my hairstyle, but I had never asked anyone to physically alter their appearance for the wedding.", "Unfortunately, I don't have physical proof, but there were multiple witnesses. \nMost of it was blatant lies. The witnesses have known me for years, and most of the lies were about things in the group chat that didn't happen or when they were present. \nWe had all gotten together the week prior. I had made dinner, and we were going to work on a couple of small things for the wedding. \nMy fiance was there helping, too. He had two drinks in five hours. \nThe biggest thing was that she had told them that he was drunk and was probably getting drunk because he no longer wanted to marry me.\nThey had all been there and knew it was completely untrue.", "My friend promised me that I wouldn\u2019t have to wear a dress and I had to wear a dress. It was for one day so I didn\u2019t mind. Although weirdly, I now wear dresses almost every day", "So what you're saying is that these witnesses, presumably the same ones who told you these tales of her trashing the fiance, have a history of being uncredible? Or are you saying what the friend said was false? Because again, no proof at the end of the day... \n\nDo they also have a history of disliking this best friend? Not trying to be rude but I'm confused why you would take their word now if I'm understanding this correctly. \n\n Hell idk why you'd be friends with anyone who lies about shit like that in the first place and believe them over your close friend. Idk about the getting drunk thing cuz...idk once again your other friends have lied in the past, and blatantly so. I'd give the BFF the benefit of the doubt here. ESPECIALLY if she has been nothing but pleasant or respectful to the fiance and that there's no reason for her to be resentful. And ask your fiance if he remembers anything like her behavior or theirs. \n\nThat'd make it YTA or ESH b/c yeah she has the right to be angry, not so much out of not being MOH. While you have the right to conduct your wedding, it's understandable why she's angry because you're operating on very likely false info. Especially from ppl who also blatantly lied about shit you admitted that never happened in group chats. That's what I'm trying to get why they're credible now, and if they have beef with the woman. To the point where they might as well make up lies to boot her away. Again I'm not sure why you'd wanna be friends with these ppl or better yet, not call them out or hear out your friend first. I'd be pissed too and flip at my supposed \"best friend\" for shit she clearly cannot verify and is so out of left field, taking liars' words instead.", "The witnesses have never lied to me. The maid of honor was blatantly lying to them. We were all there, and he was not drunk.", "Oh ok I thought you meant THEY have lied about her about shit she never said in a group chat. \n\nMy bad lol even then I'd try to give her the benefit of the doubt, tho if you heard her about the drunk fiance...yeah that benefit of the doubt would be paper thin. I wonder what the context was and if it was meant to be a joke or something.", "No problem, this is my first time posting on here. I'm not a fan of how the paragraphs get squished together, but I can see how it would read like that.", "NTA It's your wedding and your MOH is being a pain in the a**. You did the right thing.", "NTA \n\nShe agreed to be in the wedding which means following your vision, within reason, and your requests were extremely reasonable.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m addicted to bridezilla stories. Heck me and my daughter did a dance because it\u2019s wedding season. Time for the crazy stories. \n\nYou win today. Entitled MOH. Crazy indeed.", "NTA. She is a gold plated pain in the.", "NTA how is she going bridzilla when she ain\u2019t the bride", "NTA\n\nShe sounds dreadful and unsupportive. You were not being over controlling.", "I'm just imagining what the dress she picked would have looked like, probably cut down to there in the front and slit up to there on the side.", "I once said I wouldn't be caught dead wearing pink. Guess how that turned out. XD"]}
