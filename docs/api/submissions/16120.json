To our clothing, hairstyles, and even tattoo styles.\nA year ago, I asked my maid of honor and bridesmaids to be in my wedding. I had made cute little boxes with a robe for getting ready the day of, a cut spa candle, customized cup with their names on it, jewelry for the wedding, and a color swatch for the dress. \nI let everyone pick their own dress it just needed to be wedding appropriate, and no excessive cleavage. Then, we would make everything look cohesive with hair, makeup, and accessories. I thought this would be the best and easiest way to do it. I was definitely wrong. \nWe had decided on nude classic shoes. They were still able to choose their own shoes as long as it was a nude, classic shoe. The hair and makeup we chose are classic and elegant. The jewelry had already been purchased and given to them. \nAbout three months ago, everything started to go downhill. First, it was the shoes. She came over one day to \"help\" me with wedding stuff. When she arrived she showed me her shoes for the wedding. They were gladiator style heels. Then she proceeded to tell me that the shoes I had bought for the wedding/ the style I had chosen was a grandma style. \nThen it was the hair. I had posted in the group chat a couple of nice elegant hair style ideas. She proceeded to freak out about and went off on me and the other bridesmaids that she wouldn't be doing any of that \"elegant crap.\" \nThen it was the earrings. The earrings and jewelry that everyone received in their box when they accepted being in the wedding a year ago. She was going to buy a different pair of earrings because she didn't like the style of the earrings. \nLast Wednesday, I was to the point of not caring anymore. I was just tired of arguing about everything. Then Thursday my bridesmaids informed me of several awful things she was saying about my fiance and I. Friday, I kicked her out of the wedding. I had one of my bridesmaids with me when I did it in case it went badly. \nShe went absolutely crazy and blamed me for being a bridezilla and that I'm an asshole for kicking her out of the wedding. \nAITAH?", "created_utc": 1682944121, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134l4ym/aita_for_kicking_my_maid_of_honor_out_of_my/", "score": 844, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The witnesses have known me for years, and most of the lies were about things in the group chat that didn't happen or when they were present. \nWe had all gotten together the week prior. I had made dinner, and we were going to work on a couple of small things for the wedding. \nMy fiance was there helping, too.

Or are you saying what the friend said was false? Because again, no proof at the end of the day... \n\nDo they also have a history of disliking this best friend? Not trying to be rude but I'm confused why you would take their word now if I'm understanding this correctly. \n\n Hell idk why you'd be friends with anyone who lies about shit like that in the first place and believe them over your close friend. Idk about the getting drunk thing cuz...idk once again your other friends have lied in the past, and blatantly so. I'd give the BFF the benefit of the doubt here. ESPECIALLY if she has been nothing but pleasant or respectful to the fiance and that there's no reason for her to be resentful. And ask your fiance if he remembers anything like her behavior or theirs. \n\nThat'd make it YTA or ESH b/c yeah she has the right to be angry, not so much out of not being MOH. While you have the right to conduct your wedding, it's understandable why she's angry because you're operating on very likely false info. Especially from ppl who also blatantly lied about shit you admitted that never happened in group chats. That's what I'm trying to get why they're credible now, and if they have beef with the woman. To the point where they might as well make up lies to boot her away. Again I'm not sure why you'd wanna be friends with these ppl or better yet, not call them out or hear out your friend first. I'd be pissed too and flip at my supposed \"best friend\" for shit she clearly cannot verify and is so out of left field, taking liars' words instead.", "The witnesses have never lied to me. The maid of honor was blatantly lying to them. We were all there, and he was not drunk.", "Oh ok I thought you meant THEY have lied about her about shit she never said in a group chat. \n\nMy bad lol even then I'd try to give her the benefit of the doubt, tho if you heard her about the drunk fiance...yeah that benefit of the doubt would be paper thin.

Like your wedding, these were all norms we had agreed to up front that S decided she wanted to change without any agreement from the rest of us. Keep in mind this was a volunteer group and no one was forcing her to be there. It got to the point where she was tracking down group members at work, wanting to talk for 2-3 hours about her complaints.  We all collectively decided to remove her, and then she went around trolling for votes with our friends to complain about how we kicked her out.  Here\u2019s what I said to anyone who asked:\n\n\u201cIt was becoming increasingly clear that S was very unhappy being part of the group as evidenced by all the complaining she was doing.  Sadly, her negativity was hurting the group, so we decided to relieve her of her unhappiness by removing her. She should be much happier now.\u201d\n\nSo, she can complain all she wants, but you don\u2019t have to listen to it.

I picked their dress and asked for a general style of shoe. Other than that I just asked that they don\u2019t wear anything ostentatious. But they\u2019ve been texting me about each piece of jewelry, what they can wear in their hair, nail color, everything.

I am sorry that you have to go through this.  Congrats on your wedding!", "NTA and I'm guessing ex-friend too, not just ex maid of honor? Because the behavior you described was over-the-top for someone claiming to be a friend (e.g., trash talking you and your fiance to the others).  \n\n\nIf she was that unhappy about apparently everything she could have told you she wanted out and then hopefully one of your bridesmaids would have been willing to step in. That would have sucked but it would better than being a maidzilla", "What was she saying about you?", "NTA.\n\nIt's an honor to be asked to stand in someone's wedding. I have worn full 3 piece suits in sweltering summer heat, fully risking heat stroke, to stand by a good friend to be his best man. I've worn some of the ugliest shirts and worn some of the tackiest ties while being a groomsman or best man. Don't get me started on the hundreds of dollars I had to spend to find cowboy boots in my size to be worn for a grand total of 90 minutes.\n\nMy point isn't to complain about any of those things. My point is to stress that as someone who is asked to stand for a couple during their wedding, that should be viewed as an honor. Chances are very good that you'll be clothes you don't love or have your hair in a style that's not your preferred style. It's one day. Deal with it. Embrace the moment, embrace the bond that comes from being part of such a special experience, and absolutely don't make someone's wedding day about *you*. \n\nYour friend was being a jerk. I hope there's still time to reconcile before the wedding. Her behavior sucks, but it would suck worse losing a friend over something that might still be fixable.", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry your friendship has ended the way it has.  Anyone who acts the way she is acting, though, is being the AH.  Not you.  It is YOUR WEDDING.  You DO get to dictate hair style, within reason, shoe style, dress, etc.  \n\nGood grief - you PROVIDED the jewelry to her and asked her to wear it.  We aren't talking about a situation where the earings require pierced ears and she doesn't have pierced ears,  she wants something totally different.  \n\nSimilarly, you asked for nude, classic shoes.  Totally makes sense.  Elegant hair - totally makes sense.  \n\nSounds like she is going through something and decided to dump on you.  I'm so sorry.", "NTA. I am MOH for my best friend.

I mean, there are some alarming facts, like her behaving like a bridesmaidzilla but without the excuse of being a stressed out bride, lying about your fiance, accusing him of drinking (while maybe being the one with the addiction problem herself) not realising she is getting massively on your nerves, accusing you to be difficult without her being able to reflect on her own behaviour....\n\nIs it possible she is in financial trouble? It could be the reason she is insisting in wearing some shoes she already owns, is looking endlessly for a dress because it has to be cheap, and sold the earrings for cash, pretending she does not like them.\n\nYou have obviously known her for a long time, and I guess this is not her usual behaviour. You sound like a very nice person and maybe your friend is used to you caring for her a lot. So if she is more of a lonely person, and you are usually the one to console her if she is angry or upset, maybe better make someone check in on her.
