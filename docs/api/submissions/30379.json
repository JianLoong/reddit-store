{"id": 30379, "submission_id": "17oadxh", "title": "AITA for saying that my MIL won't be able to babysit alone?", "selftext": "Hi guys! Throwaway because my husband follows my main account.\n\nMy husband (36M) and I (34F) are having out first baby in January, and are very excited to meet him! Our parents both live less than 10 minutes away and are also very excited for the first grandbaby on either side of the family, and are obviously very keen to help us out once out little boy comes.\n\nHowever, we had a disagreement earlier when discussing babysitting arrangements for when we need a break during the sleep-deprived hellscape that are going to be the newborn and infant stages, and I'm not sure of whether I'm in the right or not.\n\nMy MIL is lovely, and a heck of a lady. She raised my husband and his sisters alone after their father up and left when my husband (the oldest) was only 7yo, and is one of the kindest people I know. But she is in her mid-70s, has had a knee and hip replacement in the past year, and is still not very mobile. She has only recently been cleared to drive short distances, needs to use a walker or a cane 90% of the time, and cannot get up off of a low seat like the couch without assistance. Because of this, I have (very nicely) told my husband that she will most likely not be able to solo-babysit our baby until he is older, since I honestly think that she would not be physically able to care for an infant or a young toddler due to her mobility issues. To me, if she cannot stand up without assistance or move quickly in case of an accident or emergency, there is no way I would feel safe leaving the baby with her for longer than 20 minutes while I have a shower upstairs.\n\nHe was offended and insists that his mom took care of them all brilliantly when they were younger, and I don't doubt that - but she didn't have these issues back then. So I said that kiddo's safety is priority #1, and if that if he wants his mom to babysit, it needs to be with one of my parents (who are both in their 50s, very fit and quick on their feet) or one of his sisters  present. She can come visit and spend time with him whenever she wants, and I know that she is going to be an amazing grandma, but I just do not think it would be safe for her to be in charge of him solo until he is a bit more independent (probably around preschool age). My husband said he understood, but he still looks sad, which breaks my heart (I may or may not have been crying about this thanks to the stupid pregnancy hormones).\n\nSo, dear folks of Reddit, AITA for putting my foot down and saying that my MIL won't be allowed to babysit our son unassisted until he's older?\n\nEdit: just adding that this came up because my husband mentioned that MIL told him she can't wait to babysit our little one right off the bat so we can get time to ourselves and decompress, so I tried to gently make him understand that her physical condition would make it almost impossible to safely care for an infant on her own. She would also need to carry our son upstairs into the nursery to get to the changing table, which would involve carrying him up a flight of stairs while navigating a safety gate and our two dogs; considering that she needs someone to help her up and down the stairs in case she trips, this would be extremely dangerous.\n\nEdit 2: she has recovered from her hip replacement really well, but the knee replacement has been trickier, and she is still struggling 6 months on. It unfortunately does not help that she is really heavy and has not exercised in decades with the exception of very light PT post-op, so she still heavily relies on her cane on good days, and her walker on bad ones. She literally cannot walk more than 10 metres without leaning on something, and has had two falls in the past 18 months.", "created_utc": 1699185729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17oadxh/aita_for_saying_that_my_mil_wont_be_able_to/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She may have been an absolutely Brilliant mum to you and your siblings but, as much as we hate to admit it, time marches on. Our bodies begin to betray us, we lose much of the strength we once had, and cannot keep up with our former selves. Our children, if brought up in a loving relationship, will always see us as we were, in this case the Super Mum who raised us. In reality, which bites, we cannot do those things we did back then.\n\nAnd think of it this way. If, God forbid, something happened to your baby while in her care, she would be filled with remorse!

My husband and I are usually both present for our now 6 yo grandson, who we've taken care of often since his infancy. We are both fit and can run, and love having him to ourselves, but it's still exhausting!", "No. It\u2019s not a case of if she\u2019s got the right attitude to be a good babysitter.

But it is very concerning that after a hip and knee replacement she is still using a walker. How is her physical therapy going? I say this because after a shattered hip that needed replacement, my mother went from one step unassisted and walker 24/7 to going to a gym and tread milling it up (for someone who almost never did exercise the first 70 years of her life, it's astonishing). BUT she didn't have a knee issue and I know those can be super tricky. \n\nFacts are she cannot carry the baby without putting herself and the baby in danger of a fall, which would be devastating.

Along as someone else is there it should be fine.", "NTA. I am in my 30s with an injury that limits my mobility. I struggle with low seats and am using cane (and sometimes crutches) to get around. I could not babysit properly right now. I know I have a high risk of injuring myself or worse, a child, if I tried.", "NTA for being concerned, but slightly the ah for not testing it out... The newborn stage is probably actually a lot better timing for mil to watch the baby, they literally eat, sleep, poop and cry which are all things you don't need perfect mobility to handle, running after a preschooler however does require quite a bit of mobility. I suggest setting up a bassinet in the livingroom (either at your house or mil's) beside a chair or couch that she is comfortable in, put a 10 lbs bag of sugar in the bassinet and ask mil if she is able to pick it up out of the bassinet from where she is seated, you can have a tote of everything diaper related and a change pad either beside the couch (if that's where she is sitting) or beside the coffee table close by so that she doesn't have to carry the baby around. You don't even have to tell mil that you are determining if she can watch the baby alone, just tell her you want to see what she is capable of because you don't want to push her further than she can go.", "[deleted]", "Why are you making statements like this before baby is even born? \n\nMakes no sense.  \n\nObviously you have no baby experience.  Newborns go between bassinet and sofa. Not a marathon.\n\nOnce baby starts moving you could reassess but honestly.....why the power play blanket statements now?", "Yta if you bring this up now outside of your husband.   You are months away from delivery, and likely 3 months after birth before you need more than 20mins while you shower.   Her surgeries were within the year and she may  be a whole other person physically in 6 months, especially if she continues pt.   If she\u2019s a lovely as you say,  she will likely identify her own limitations when the time comes\n\nNah for thinking about it, and getting on the same page with your husband, but I think you are borrowing trouble and may cause unnecessary drama at this stage,  assigning something to watch the baby with her at this stage is ridiculous", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your MIL heart is in the right place but if the baby was in distress she wouldn't be able to move fast enough. Or what if she falls holding the baby. For the sake of preventing an argument or hard feelings try to find someone who could mediate the situation. I know some doctors will be able to help direct you to  resources. Or even your MIL doctor could talk to her if she is or isn't capable of caring for a baby.", "NTA in the slightest.\n\nBut is all the pressure around the idea of her babysitting coming just from your husband? It might be that she's already very aware of her own limitations and knows she wouldn't be able to do as much.\n\nMy parents have offered to do one day a week childcare, but stated they couldn't offer more than that (except in an emergency) as looking after a small person is very tiring. And that was what I was going to say to them anyway, they were already aware of what they can and can't realistically do.\n\nI do think that your husband is struggling with th fact that his Mum is getting old. It's a difficult thing for anyone to accept. But you aren't an AH for pointing this out and as you say, your baby's safety comes first.", "NTA and has MIL even expressed an interest/desire to solo babysit?  I mean, I agree with you - it's not safe or practical given her physical limitations - and I'm sure she remembers what caring for an infant/baby physically requires.  He looks sad, and that breaks your heart, but he'll get over it.  Don't back down on this - baby's safety is priority #1.", "NTA", "NTA. My mom is 74, has had two knee replacements and has a slew of chronic medical problems. Is she mentally totally fine to babysit our young kids? Yes. Physically? Absolutely not. It\u2019s hard work running around after a toddler, picking them up if they need to be, or doing anything for them really.", "NTA your husband needs to realize she is older and has some limitations and that's okay. Like you said babys safety is top priority not hurt feelings. She needs a cane so that's holding the baby one handed while not being best. I know it would crush her if she accidentally fall. Nothing wrong with taking precautions and making sure everyone is respectful towards her. She can still hold and play and change and feed but it's best with someone else in case she needs help.", "I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s a big deal. If someone isn\u2019t physically up to the the task, it isn\u2019t an accusation that they are a bad person. It simply means their body isn\u2019t as springy as it used to be. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t like her or trust her. It\u2019s simply reality that she has limits. It doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t hang out with the baby. It means she can\u2019t be all alone with the baby. Why would she want to really? If she cannot walk without a cane/walker, how can she or you husband to expect her to carry the baby from one place to another? Your husband is correct, she raised him and his siblings, she knows how hard it is and she probably knows she can\u2019t do it with both hands on her walker. I don\u2019t think it takes away from her ability to be a fantastic grandmother that she doesn\u2019t babysit alone. Safety always comes before feelings. You and your husband could never forgive yourself for just letting grandma do it because is easier than discussing something unpleasant if some kind of accident happened. \n\nNTA", "Jeeeez.. sorry,  I would never let an elderly anyone watch an infant, 70\u2019s 80\u2019s plus that a disaster in waiting\u2026.let them enjoy baby while you are around. It\u2019s not about trust, it\u2019s all safety for them and baby.", "NTA  It's hard to recognize that your parents are getting older and unable to do what they used to do. I think that she could be fine with an infant for short periods of time as long as there's a stroller she can use to push the baby around while indoors (they're pretty much immobile themselves at that stage) but unless her mobility issues improve, she should not be taking care of the baby once it's more mobile. It's a safety issue, I would not have been comfortable with my FIL taking care of our kids by himself as he has similar mobility issues.", "NTA but also remember, by the time you and baby are ready for babysitting she may be in much better condition physically. 3 months until birth and probably another 3-ish until you have baby sitters for longer than 30 mins anyways. Mostly because of the time it takes to heal, and really during those 3 months, they\u2019ll need to come over anyways to watch the baby for you to shower or nap yourself. So just stay open that in 6-8 months she may be better and can be an option sooner than you think granted this all depends on if nothing else happens, and she\u2019s in active rehab and keeps up with moving around", "NTA. Your views are valid. This was just a conversation between you and your husband, right?\n\nYou don't really need to tell your MIL she's out for babysitting with your outside voice unless she asks after the baby is actually here.\n\nHonestly, you don't need to be super mobile to watch a newborn. They can't do anything on their own or 'get away from her' such that she needs to run. And they'll sleep a LOT during the day for a while (barring colic or something).\n\nPlay it by ear. It's good you raised it with your husband and are communicating, but you can always hold off on some decisions until they actually need to be made. Some moms and MILs become super overbearing and you might prefer one helper over the other (or neither) for reasons not related to mobility at all. And good luck!", "NTA. This isn\u2019t personal, just practical. But, be aware, it\u2019s more than likely she won\u2019t be able to watch your kid as a preschooler either. I have a kid around the age and he is way harder for my mom (who is in excellent health) to watch as he is sneaky fast and lacks self preservation skills. Don\u2019t set the expectation that your MIL can watch the kids solo some time in the future because it is likely not the case.", "NTA at all. Baby's safety comes first. But is there a way you can make her feel that she's contributing to baby's care without it becoming a safety issue? E.x. once baby is ready for solids, if she wants to help make pureed baby foods (if she's able to despite her limited mobility).", "NTA. \n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t able to drive due to vision problems. What I did was drive to her home. Hand her the baby and the diaper bag. She would sit on the couch holding the baby while I slept for 3-4 hours in the guest room.", "NTA, but perhaps during the first few months you can ask her to come babysit while you grab a short nap.  This will make her feel useful and give her time with her grand baby, but you will be there in case you are needed", "https://www.myweekly.co.uk/2020/02/12/why-looking-after-the-grandchildren-is-good-for-you-and-them/#:~:text=Grandparents%20over%2070%20who%20regularly,or%20just%20the%20unconditional%20love.", "NTA.\n\nYou're being a good mom.  If you need further help with this, bring your husband with you to your next OB visit or a future pediatrician visit - and ask the doc to speak to the situation in front of your husband.\n\nInstead of saying who the family member is, you could put it like this...   We have a family member in their 50's - 80's  (what age?)  on my husband's side of the family who is not quick and agile due to...  (list the health situations) and it's my feeling that this person is not a \"safe\" fit to babysit an infant alone as they wouldn't be physically able to respond quickly etc., could you please address what \"IS\" a proper situation for a person to be able to safely baby sit an infant?  Bottom line here is - am I in the wrong for suggesting that this person is not a healthy fit because of their physical situation?\n\nBTW -- my guess is - his relative wouldn't even WANT to be babysitting alone, knowing their own inabilities.", "NTS but MIL could be very helpful in watching baby while you take a shower or a nap. She'd be independent with a way for quick assistance.", "NTA\nYour husband is in complete denial about his mother's abilities.  I am alao due in January and I have discussed with my partner that his mother absolutely will not be babysitting.  She's a total feather head, and while physically capable of caring for a baby I honestly think she  wouldn't remember to change the baby or feed the baby. Some people are great for cuddling the baby and nothing more. Your husband will get a serious reality check when baby arrives.", "NTA - you are not being cruel, you are being realistic. You are a parent now and the safety and well being of LO is the more important than keeping the grandmas happy.", "NTA, but there are compromises, I think.  \n\n\nMaybe setting up a situation where she doesn't need to navigate the stairs, and in the daytime when the dogs could be out in the yard, perhaps? A baby can nap in a bassinette, and arrangements for diaper-changing downstairs could be set up. And making it a short period of time - like only an hour or two - because while you have legitimate concerns, you could make it so that she feels involved and useful, once in a while?", "NTA. You aren't saying anything bad about her as a person or grandmother. What you are saying is that you have Safety concerns. For both your MIL and your child. Yes your MIL was able to raise your husband and his siblings. Before she had the hip and knee replacements. When she was young and mobile. \n\nNta. And your husband needs to understand that you are doing this for his mother's safety as well.", "NTA.", "NTA. I am a long term care nurse and have also worked extensively on ortho units with hip and knee replacements. She relies on walking aids and needs assistance with stairs. She cannot be responsible for a newborn where she needs to be mobile and carrying him around.\n\nShe can still be an amazing grandma but it would be a risk to both of them if she attempted to care for him independently.", "NTA. Can't your husband see that there is a huge difference from MIL in the past and MIL now? Somebody who needs a walker or a cane can't lift and carry a baby safely, nor should she be asked to.", "NTA but do yourself a favour and get a changing mat and supplies for downstairs too, make it as easy for yourself as possible!", "YTA!! Wow. You act like you can\u2019t just have a diaper bag by her with a mat. As if anyone uses their changing table in the nursery to change the baby. Think outside of the box. If grandma is babysitting make it easier for her to babysit. She will know what her limitations are and if it\u2019s too much for her then she will say I can\u2019t do that without help. I think it will be easier for her to babysit a newborn Vs a toddler who can run around. You\u2019re over thinking this.", "NAH\n\nThe fact of the matter is that she can\u2019t carry an infant or a toddler. \n\nInvite her over to help when you and husband are home. She can cuddle with your baby while you shower and husband works on whatever else needs done in the house. \n\nWho does she live it? If she can\u2019t get up off a seat on her own, how does she do it at home?", "How about a compromise? \n\nI was a \"Mother's Helper\" when I was 10ish with my neighbors. The mom worked from home and my job was basically to keep her little girl (~2) occupied while she got work done. She would change her and be in the next room over if things went awry. I also did this when her second child came. She would do most everything that she wouldn't be comfortable with me doing because I was still in elementary school, but otherwise it gave her several hours of the day back for work and cleaning.\n\nCan gma do that?\n\nYou can change your baby and handle the stairs, but gma can do all the fun things like feeding/burping the baby, playing with him, holding him, etc. while you can doze on the chair right next to them, clean if you so choose, do a craft or activity nearby (e.g. do your nails, play a game on your computer you've been unable to get to, painting, etc. Whatever you like doing that you might not be able to do right then otherwise!)\n\nAnd in all honesty, you don't need to traverse the stairs for the changing table. I am seven years older than my baby siblings, and trust me on this, they got changed anywhere that was convenient and clean. The changing table was basically for diaper storage unless we happened to be in there. You can get changing mats that roll up and are easy to wipe clean (for travel and stuff). Depending on how well gma physically handles all the above, you might consider having her babysit but the second floor is *off limits*. A pack n' play for the baby to sleep in (or similar, whatever is recommended nowadays), a changing station on a table or something, and all the supplies she could need.\n\nNAH. No one snapped at each other. If anything I'd bet dollars to donuts that your husband is having to confront how old his mom is.\n\nBut y'all are fine. Congratulations!\n\nETA: If y'all have a younger cousin or niece/nephew who'd be interested in babysitting, you could pair them with gma and spin it a bit like the first story to spare gma's feelings. But the kid could do the \"heavy lifting\" (picking up the baby from the floor/crib, traverse stairs as necessary, etc.)\n\nThere are options!", "It depends on her limitations. My MIL has rheumatoid arthritis and uses crutches but when my daughter was a newborn she was a great babysitter. I\u2019d drop her off so I could grab coffee or lunch at the local cafe or hubby and I would get a meal together. My MIL is still and always been a great babysitter but there were stages she couldn\u2019t watch her alone but now that my daughter is more independent and walking she watches her alone for 2-3 hours at a time as long as she doesn\u2019t have to put her down for sleep she can handle it .", "NTA. She's not physically capable of caring for the physical demands of a baby.  Can she do individual tasks like soothing the baby,  diapers and feedings? Yes.  But she walking, bouncing, carrying etc that goes into those tasks are where she's now limited. \n\nI don't fault your husband for seeing his mom as she used to be, but for your baby AND your mom's safety he really needs to look at her as she is now, physically.", "NTA but I think there are ways you could let her feel useful. Could she come round to \u2018babysit\u2019 to give you time to say have a bath, take a shower, have a nap, cut the grass etc?

I\u2019d be surprised if she wanted to be left alone with an infant.", "Bless her! My Meemaw is 105 this year and her memory is pretty spotty, but she has been delighted every time I told her that she'll be a great-grandma soon! She keeps forgetting soon after, but it's still really sweet.", "Thank you so mucy for your kind feedback! I'll show him this post tonight, so we can talk this through.", "I guess my reasoning was that a 4yo would be much easier to deal with for her since they could bake cookies (she's an amazing baker) and watch a Disney movie or something, and he couldn't exactly run away like he could, for example, at the park. My biggest worry is her falling while carrying him as an infant or not noticing him doing something dangerous like climbing the bookshelves as a young toddler.", "Her hip replacement went really well, but she has been having issues with her knee. After 6 months of PT, she was essentially told that this is probably as recovered as she will ever be. She only uses the walker on bad days, perhaps a few times a month, but heavily relies on the cane the rest of the time. She is unfortunately a very large woman (it seems that her weight is what caused the issue with her knee in the first place according to the doctor), so even her PT was very limited because she could handle little more than exercising with a tennis ball and elastic band after the op.\n\nShe also still cannot take stairs without someone helping her in case she trips, so I honestly do not see a safe way for her to carry our little boy upstairs to the nursery to change his diaper, especially with our dog underfoot.", "I guess our parents and my SILs are the only people we would consider 'trusted' babysitters; I wouldn't want a random friend of my MIL's I have never met around my infant son when we aren't there, personally, even if she vouched for them as a safe second person to be there while she's watching the kiddo.", "If I'm just napping or showering, of course, there wouldn't be much of a problem. But the discussion was more about a date night, or taking a pet to the vet and leaving kiddo at home, that kind of situation. My concern is that MIL would not be able to stand up easily unassisted, and could fall while carrying the baby since she would not be able to use a walker or cane at the same time.", "ITA. It's when the kid is a bit older and mobile that MiL might have issues, but as a small baby, I don't get the concern.\n\nNTA because you have every right to be careful; IMHO though, you're over-cautious here.", "How exactly is someone who uses a walker or a cane supposed to pick a baby up and carry him to a changing table?", "We were discussing this because we were talking about looking after our mental health after the birth and having a plan in place if we are overwhelmed and occasionally need two baby-free hours (breast-feeding permitting). It's my first child, but I was raised with lots of baby cousins and I have helped out several friends post-pregnancy when their babies were tiny. I have taken care of my fair share of newborns, and I know that someone falling over while carrying an infant, or taking two minutes to get off the couch while the baby in the nearby bassinet that they cannot reach into is choking on regurgitated milk, can cause major issues. It's not a power play - she is welcome to babysit as long as someone who is able-bodied and is not a fall risk is with her in case something goes wrong.", "I am exactly 9 weeks from my due date, and MIL keeps mentioning how excited she is to babysit - I actually think that this is the perfect time to set expectations, while also reassuring her that she will still get plenty of bonding time with our little one. Also, this is absolutely not too soon - I only get 6 weeks of maternity leave, and then I will be back to working full-time (mostly remotely, which is a blessing). Daycare costs are prohibitive in our area, which means that we will mostly be relying on my (young and physically fit) parents' help when I need to be in the office. MIL is welcome to babysit as long as another trusted adult who can act quickly in an emergency is there, of course, and she can come over on the days I WFH to hang out with kiddo as much as she wants, so she will not be losing out on bonding time.", "She seems very keen to babysit, so this is definitely not just coming from him. My SILs are all childfree by choice and we are only planning on having the one baby, so I guess this could very realistically be her only grandchild. I do get where she's coming from - my parents are also very excited - but I think in her joy she is downplaying the severity of her physical condition.", "Oh, I'm not backing down, believe me - the nesting has fully set in, and I'm literally ready to die to protect this lil' peanut even though I'm still 9 weeks away from actually meeting him! My main worry is that she is very keen to babysit and keeps offering, so my hubby will need to (gently) let her down, and it's best to set expectations now in my opinion. She will still be able to get plenty of bonding time, but it will need to be with either us there, or another trusted adult like my mom or one of my SILs.", "It's the same with my MIL - she's mentally super sharp, but she can barely walk 10 metres without a cane; I would be terrified at the idea of her trying to carry our baby upstairs to the changing table unassisted.", "That was my train of thought. My mom or my SIL can easily do things like zip upstairs to the nursery to change his diaper, and MIL can safely play with him, feed him or even just holding him while she naps if that's what she wants.", "The heart is willing but the body is limited\u2026it\u2019s a gracious offer and she probably does mean it, but, you don\u2019t necessarily have to take her up on it and having conditions for anyone watching a baby is understandable.", "Honestly, I would wait to make any final pronouncements until you can observe her with the baby. Have her help with him while you shower, etc and see how she handles it. After all, there are plenty of parents with mobility issues who find workarounds, and baby isn\u2019t going to be mobile and getting into trouble for awhile. She can keep the baby by her pretty easily and even as he starts to crawl, can probably corral him in one small area with a gate. Plus, she will hopefully continue to improve with the knee over the next six months. \n\nMaybe she can\u2019t find workarounds that are safe, but you can watch for the first few weeks as you recover and see what you think. Then you can either give your husband specific examples or be reassured that it will be okay.", "I think you're putting a lot of energy into a discussion that is not necessary right now and might not be necessary in the future. Your baby ist not here yet and you will probably not want to go out with your husband and let someone else babysit the first weeks (probably months). Until then a lot of things can happen. Your MIL's health can improve to a point where you will be comfortable letting her babysit. Your MIL might realise that she can't handle your baby on her own and not want to babysit alone. Your husband might realise his mother is not able to handle the baby on her own when he sees her interacting with the baby during visits. \n\nI think, options 2 & 3 are likely to happen. Just see if you and your husband can agree to not let anyone babysit who is physically not able to take care of the baby (this is not limited to MIL) and to not pressure anyone into babysitting who might not really want to. And then revisit the topic of MIL babysitting when your baby is born and there have been a few interactions with MIL. It's very possible there will be no need to argue about this in the future.", "I hate to break it to you but it won\u2019t be easier as babe gets older. It will actually be harder because babe will be mobile, heavy and stronger. If there was an emergency and she needed to quickly get to babes room she would struggle. Toddlers are unpredictable, you have to be ready for anything. My MIL is amazing but she will never watch my kid unsupervised. Her mobility issues alone, it\u2019s not going to work.", "Four year olds can be tough for an older person who is not fit, they have mobility without any sense of danger.  But you don't need to worry about that ahead of time\u2014you will know when you need to. Also, your husband is going to be observing his mother and how she is around the baby. He'll see that if someone else has to pick the baby up and hand him to her, if she has trouble standing up to change his diaper, she can't be left alone with him.", "It's unfortuante she is not as physically capable as she used to be. It's not something you can overlook. I have family that used to provide primary care for their grandchild, but when the grandmother had back surgery, they took themselves off the roster as it was not safe for either grandma or the baby.", "Gotcha", "Okay; I thought you meant while you were there since you said showering. I\u2019d be nervous too. Changes my verdict.", "Or what if there\u2019s an emergency and they need to get out of the house asap? Or baby needs to be fed/burped/held? It would be a dreamworld to be able to just stick them in the bassinet", "I keep having ideas. This time it\u2019s ideas on how she could babysit with you there. If either of your houses has the space for it, you could pick up takeout and have a movie in one room while she watches the baby in another. If there was a problem, she could call you. You could give her a walkie talkie too. Or if you\u2019re in the basement, she could bang her cane against the floor. Same thing with taking a nap, which is what you will need the most. Set up a station with everything she needs, then go sleep. Make sure she knows it\u2019s a hard and fast rule that she doesn\u2019t walk while holding him: if a problem arises, she wakes you up. If that goes well, you could go on a jog around the block where you\u2019re never more than a couple minutes from home in case of an issue. You could have friends over for a game night while she tended. You could catch up on housecleaning or have her come over while you made dinner. Dinner making time is the witching hour and kids turn into monsters who won\u2019t let you cook. One time my aunt had me babysit while she ran errands. All her kids were in the car (I think some of them had to come in to some errands with her), and I sat in the car with them while she ran in to all the short stops she hadn\u2019t had time to do. She was never away from the car for more than 10-15 minutes, and it saved her from taking kids in and out of car seats a billion times. \n\nThere are lots of ways she could help you without you leaving her with the baby. She will feel loved and useful, you will get help, and you will feel comfortable with his safety.", "I swear I\u2019m not trying to tell you what to do. I just have thought of a few ideas since posting. \n\nI had twins with a 3 year old. I spent pretty much my whole life nursing babies and pumping at first, so I wasn\u2019t mobile. I set up my station on the couch. I had a boppy I could lay a newborn in next to me, I had food and drink for me, books to read to my 3 year old, etc. If Grandma had a rocker she could get in and out of easily, she could have a table on one side and a bassinet on the other. The table could have formula, breastmilk in a cooler, diapers, etc. She could feed him, change him, and rock him on her lap. If she needed to get up, she could safely put him in the bassinet. \n\nYou could also leave her with an umbrella stroller. She could put him in it and use it as a walking aid for her so she could move more quickly in an emergency. And of course, she would need a phone in case she needed to call emergency services. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m not trying to say you have to do any of this. I\u2019m just suggesting things you could try while you\u2019re there with her and see how they work.", "This was my approach as well: find ways to let MIL feel involved and useful, instead of a blanket \"Thou shalt not\" ultimatum.  \n\n\nThis woman is in her mid-seventies. There's a good chance that she won't see this grandchild grow to adulthood, and you might want to give her the opportunity of being a part of her own legacy to the world and her family while she still can.  \n\n\nBeing able to tell your child about how much his grandmother loved and cherished them, and spent time with them when they were an infant, would be a real gift for everyone involved.", "These are great suggestions. You can avoid hurting her feelings by making it clear that you want her involved with the baby. As for the physical care, ease into it incrementally (baby steps?) so everyone \u2013 MIL, hubby and you \u2013 can all get a sense for the reality of MIL caring for the baby alone. It\u2019s likely everyone will come over to your POV. The only way this gets difficult is if it\u2019s clear MIL isn\u2019t physically able to help but she and your husband persist with delusion and denial.", "My grandmother  also had a knee replacement and she\u2019s in her 70\u2019s she also has issues with her strength in her arms. That being said she watched my son when he was a baby before he became really mobile. She for sure could watch him if he was staying in one place. He could sleep on her she could feed him and bottle and change his diaper on her legs if needed. She could do all this alone for about 30-45 min. My mother was his main caretaker but if she needed to run to the store or cook a meal or do laundry she could leave her alone with him. But my grandmother knew her limitations and was not shy about saying what she could and couldn\u2019t do."]}
