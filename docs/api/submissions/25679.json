I live with my parents and is studying at nearby college. James was my senior and staying in dorm back when we met. \n\nA few months back, he graduated and got a job in the same city. He rented an apartment with his friend Max.\n\n I visited on off days and some evenings for a few hours. With them both, the place was always messy and dishes were always present in the sink. It didn't bother me much since whenever I came over, we hung out in his room. It was relatively cleaner in there, except for dirty clothes. \n\nLately Max's gf Julie has been staying over a couple of days a week. I started noticing the place was way cleaner. I initially thought maybe James and Max finally started doing chores, but James told me it was Julie. She had started picking around the house, taking on chore of washing dishes, wiping counters etc. Sometimes she even asked James if he had any laundry to be done and did it for him. \n\nIt didn't sit right with me, but whatever. None of my business. But then James started saying I could learn a thing or two from Julie. I asked what he meant. He told me I should be more like Julie and help around. \n\nI told him no way. I didn't get why Julie wanted to do it, but I wasn't just going to do his chores for him. He said what good is having a girlfriend if she won't even help out with the domestic chores. That when we move in together I would anyway be the one doing it all so I should start practicing now itself. \n\nThis made me really mad and I just left, cancelling our date that night. \n\nAs I reached home I could see several missed calls and text. I texted him I didn't like his insinuation, I would never do his chores for him and will only be in a equal partnership. He called and left a message that he was just joking and I was an AH for leaving like that. \n\nAITA in this?", "created_utc": 1693167520, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1630s9p/aita_for_refusing_to_help_bf_with_his_chores/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ask him to explain the punchline to you.", "NTA \n\nHe wasn\u2019t joking, he just didn\u2019t expect you to call him out and get upset. \n\nI will never understand why women treat men like toddlers and clean up after them. They should be cleaning the house themselves and Julie\u2019s behavior is only further instilling that men shouldn\u2019t have to do anything.

Both of their mothers (sisters to each other) were really sexist and never made the boys do any housework at all.  \n\nOn the other hand, I had been taught how to clean, cook and do laundry, and was good at all of this.  My boyfriend's place drove me nuts.  So, we started having \"HOUSEKEEPING NIGHTS.\"  About every other week, we would do all his laundry, vacuum, change his sheets, etc.  He HAD to help and couldn't just sit there.  He also would go to the grocery store with a list I gave him.  I worked my entire career, and my husband had to learn to help.", "Nta.
