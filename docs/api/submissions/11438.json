She should not be bad mouthing your father to you especially after you ask her to stop. She sounds toxic I\u2019m sorry. From the sounds of it, your dad deserves better. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re being put in the middle - from a kid that used to be put in the middle. Take care of yourself", "NTA. Mate, have you considered you've probably been abused. Now, considering their both alcoholics, I doubt it's just your mother that acts this toxic. But the behavior you've talked about here is emotional abuse 101. If they were like this your whole childhood I'd consider getting a therapist to help you work out how to place healthy boundaries here.\n\nOh also, your family are huge AHs. It is never the role of a kid to emotionally support a parent. It's just not. Also, she can talk to other people. Such as, her own mother. Call your grandmother out on it.", "NTA. \n\nAnd not your job, babe. Your parent's marriage, addictions, mental health struggles and how they feel about those things....all fall under the realm of 'none of your business'. I'm saying this as someone who was parentified and dragged into their parent's marriage at a very young age. \n\nYou cannot help her. All you can do is give her a sympathy fix that distracts her from getting her crap together. If she needs to talk to someone and only you will do, she needs a therapist. Sounds like everyone involved could benefit from the support of a mental health professional. \n\nDisentangling your stuff from theirs is a process, but the sooner you start it, the better off you, and they will be.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou're your mom's child, not her therapist. It sounds like she needs an additional person she can talk to and work out her feelings, either a friend or a professional. It's not okay to use your kid as a therapist.", "NTA\n\nIt isn't fair on you for your mother to call you every night and bad mouth your father. It sounds like she needs to go to therapy to talk about these issues instead of venting to you everyday.", "Softly, NTA. There\u2019s a lot going on here that you can\u2019t list or maybe you even know. Alcoholic parents are a nightmare, but I encourage you to not choose sides if they\u2019re both struggling and to step away as much as possible. Just because he\u2019s waking up first doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a saint and she\u2019s the devil. They\u2019re both just people battling demons. It\u2019s not good for you especially. It\u2019s natural to pick a favorite, but it sounds like they\u2019ve both made a toxic bed and are hoping to get you to pick one or the other. Please seek therapy, they clearly are just starting to address things and asking you to validate one person or the other.  \n\nI\u2019m very sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. Focus on your own well-being and self love as much as possible. Drink lots of water and try to get good sleep. This crap can drain your body and mind.", "NTA if you what it help your mom, supporting her mistakes and ignoring her toxicity is not the answer, you can still be supportive without clapping for her mistakes your family is weird \u201cshe\u2019s grieving\u201d ?? Well maybe she should have acted more like her age if she didn\u2019t want to grieve.\n\nWhat obligation does your dad have to stay with her when she\u2019s hurting him so much? Isn\u2019t your dad \u201cgrieving\u201d too, shouldn\u2019t you \u201ccut him some slack\u201d too? Tell that to your family the next time they stand against you", "NTA - sometimes you have to call your parents out on their BS.\n\nI suspect your parents have been glossing over or outright lying about how rough the home has been, so you may need to set the record straight with the extended family. Be mentally prepared for a wide rage of reactions, from them refusing to believe your version of events, to you suddenly realizing that your \u201cbaseline normal\u201d is actually not very normal.\n\nKeep your head above water. Don\u2019t let their turmoil pull you under.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
