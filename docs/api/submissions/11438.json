She should not be bad mouthing your father to you especially after you ask her to stop. She sounds toxic I\u2019m sorry. From the sounds of it, your dad deserves better. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re being put in the middle - from a kid that used to be put in the middle. Take care of yourself", "NTA. Mate, have you considered you've probably been abused. Now, considering their both alcoholics, I doubt it's just your mother that acts this toxic. But the behavior you've talked about here is emotional abuse 101. If they were like this your whole childhood I'd consider getting a therapist to help you work out how to place healthy boundaries here.\n\nOh also, your family are huge AHs. It is never the role of a kid to emotionally support a parent. It's just not. Also, she can talk to other people. Such as, her own mother. Call your grandmother out on it.", "NTA. \n\nAnd not your job, babe. Your parent's marriage, addictions, mental health struggles and how they feel about those things....all fall under the realm of 'none of your business'. I'm saying this as someone who was parentified and dragged into their parent's marriage at a very young age. \n\nYou cannot help her. All you can do is give her a sympathy fix that distracts her from getting her crap together. If she needs to talk to someone and only you will do, she needs a therapist. Sounds like everyone involved could benefit from the support of a mental health professional. \n\nDisentangling your stuff from theirs is a process, but the sooner you start it, the better off you, and they will be.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou're your mom's child, not her therapist. It sounds like she needs an additional person she can talk to and work out her feelings, either a friend or a professional. It's not okay to use your kid as a therapist.", "NTA\n\nIt isn't fair on you for your mother to call you every night and bad mouth your father. It sounds like she needs to go to therapy to talk about these issues instead of venting to you everyday.", "Softly, NTA. There\u2019s a lot going on here that you can\u2019t list or maybe you even know. Alcoholic parents are a nightmare, but I encourage you to not choose sides if they\u2019re both struggling and to step away as much as possible. Just because he\u2019s waking up first doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a saint and she\u2019s the devil. They\u2019re both just people battling demons. It\u2019s not good for you especially. It\u2019s natural to pick a favorite, but it sounds like they\u2019ve both made a toxic bed and are hoping to get you to pick one or the other. Please seek therapy, they clearly are just starting to address things and asking you to validate one person or the other.  \n\nI\u2019m very sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. Focus on your own well-being and self love as much as possible. Drink lots of water and try to get good sleep. This crap can drain your body and mind.", "NTA if you what it help your mom, supporting her mistakes and ignoring her toxicity is not the answer, you can still be supportive without clapping for her mistakes your family is weird \u201cshe\u2019s grieving\u201d ?? Well maybe she should have acted more like her age if she didn\u2019t want to grieve.\n\nWhat obligation does your dad have to stay with her when she\u2019s hurting him so much? Isn\u2019t your dad \u201cgrieving\u201d too, shouldn\u2019t you \u201ccut him some slack\u201d too? Tell that to your family the next time they stand against you", "NTA - sometimes you have to call your parents out on their BS.\n\nI suspect your parents have been glossing over or outright lying about how rough the home has been, so you may need to set the record straight with the extended family. Be mentally prepared for a wide rage of reactions, from them refusing to believe your version of events, to you suddenly realizing that your \u201cbaseline normal\u201d is actually not very normal.\n\nKeep your head above water.

Good on you calling out her crap.", "NTA - Saying mean things, throwing him out, locks changed over many years caught up to her. Her childish tantrums worked until now. \\~Say what you mean and mean what you say.\\~ \n\nYes, addiction plays a role but a person is responsible for their actions. You reached your limit.

Good on you for standing up for yourself and your mental health.", "\"She told my grandma nobody fully understands the relationship like me\" ..... You do understand the relationship. Hence your replies to her complaints. Your mom doesn't like hearing the truth.  The truth hurts. She pushed your dad one too many times. Good for him for finally giving his wife exactly what she asked for. I hope he has a wonderful, less stressful life. Good luck with setting boundaries with your mom.

She\u2019s a drama queen and you\u2019ve heard all this before. Grieving is fine and there\u2019s probably some of that mixed in. Thing is they sound codependent so I\u2019m betting dad will be back sooner than later. Tell her you\u2019ll no longer discuss it. OP I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to deal with alcoholic parents. Good luck.", "NTA.", "It\u2019s not her fault any more than it\u2019s your dad\u2019s fault. They\u2019re both drunks, which means neither is healthy, which is why your response wasn\u2019t healthy (understandable and healthy are separate issues). I think, based on my own parental relationship roughness, that it HAD to come out. Give some time to think and process for both of you, then you two can try to talk about it at some point (preferably with a therapist, but not everyone can afford). It\u2019s ok if you two never really smooth this over, but she is dealing with the death of her long term relationship. Psychologically speaking, it\u2019s actually MORE difficult than a death because people refuse to validate it and that makes everything worse. It may be helpful to find some grief counseling materials or resources for her. Alcoholism and grief shut the frontal lobe down which is why she\u2019s on a loop.", "NTA.

He is getting that they are not a good match anymore. \r  \n\r  \nTell the family then they can deal with her crying everynight and how it seems like she is blaming your dad 100%.. and not taking any of the responsibility for their relationship falling a part.\r  \n\r  \nOP you can only take so much before you blow up.. I know.", "NTA What a toxic relationship. I would bluntly say that you have no part in it and won't be taking any sides or be the emotional support person for either. I've witnessed a couple of relationships like this where once broken up, one of them quit drinking and was much happier because their drinking was an escape from being with a toxic partner. I wonder if your dad will be the one who quits."]}
