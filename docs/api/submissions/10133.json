And if he was complaining the entire time, the waiter obviously never came back to check so he had to wait till the end.", "He said they almost had the texture of gummy bears", "I like Outback lobster tails.... ;___;", "What is with the hostility lol", "You do need to use your best judgement on some places. Like I\u2019m not gonna order the fish from IHOP", "Lol like i said in another comment, sometimes you get lucky. They aren\u2019t who I\u2019d think of as a soup place but their French onion soup is delicious. That still doesn\u2019t make her racist for thinking one specific Mexican restaurant wouldn\u2019t have good seafood though. We also don\u2019t know how picky he is. If her bf is a pickier eater, that also may make him disinclined to like it so maybe that\u2019s something she was anticipating. I just hate when people automatically assume the worst in others without any valid reasoning behind it.", "I love eating at Mexican restaurants. We have a lot of them in the area, and I'm anxiously waiting for the opening of a new one nearby. And I'm not talking about the chains. Despite being in the NE USA, we have a large Mexican presence here. \n\nWhat you will not see much of on the menus in Mexican restaurants here is seafood. We,are a 5-6 hour drive from the sea. We have very few seafood specialty restaurants here, because the seafood has to travel. That also makes it much more expensive than at coastal restaurants. It doesn't taste as good here. \n\nThat doesn't make someone racist to recommend not to order seafood when there is one seafood option on a menu. It means that seafood isn't popular there and isn't obtained daily. It's more than likely frozen. If you want good food, you wouldn't order Italian food in a steakhouse, Chinese food in an Applebees, or a steak from a pizza place.", "Better safe than sorry", "Why are you responding with more vague comments rather than just explaining exactly what was wrong with the shrimp?\n\nAnd using one's best judgment would result in nobody eating at IHOP at all, but somehow we all end up there every now and then anyway.", "That is not true lol", "Ahahahha ohohohoho, haha, heeeeeee. Thats adorable.", "YTA. BF has the right to expect edible food.\n\nHe shouldn't have given any tip at all.", ">I\u2019m sure you all know the type of place I\u2019m talking about\n\nActually, no, I really don't. What kind of place would that be? What about the shrimps? INFO please.", "What stopped you from leaving a better tip? He paid for your meal so couldn't you tip? YTA for that alone.", "ESH. You got some real racial biases showing. It isn't \"being bogus\". It is making incorrect assumptions based on prejudiced beliefs., your BF acted like a child, and you just let it happen.", "YTA. I think tipping culture is insane and so many are so entitled that it\u2019s ridiculous. I wouldn\u2019t have tipped and if I did I would have given what BF did too\u2026 not everyone deserves a great tip or one at all", "For more context, as OP failed to put it in her post:\n\n1. Server never visited the table, until it was time to deliver check. OP said they sat in back doing nothing. I.e Bf had no chance to ask for a different meal, or even a drawn out conversation.\n\n2. Server became argumentative with bf when he asked to have it dropped, rather than letting a manager handle it.\n\nNot sure if that sways your vote (personally changed mine,) but thought it should be told", "Right?!   If she felt the server deserved a better tip, she could have put some cash in their hand.", "I mostly agree but one year my sister picked IHOP for her birthday. My dad ordered steak & wasn't happy with it, I would not expect good steak at IHOP or order it myself, it's a pancake place - not a steakhouse.", "This context was MUCH needed! Thank you!", "Any ~10% was a \"bad tip\" in OP's eyes?!?\n\nIf they were the only server I would of gone to the bar, counter or where the till is and ask for somebody.\n\nAlso 10% is a good tip most places outside of the US.", "Doesn\u2019t change it tbh. If the server didn\u2019t come to the table then I\u2019m sure there was plenty of them around that he could have said hey I\u2019ve got an issue and blah blah blah but he didn\u2019t, he chose to sit and complain until the last second when he could have asked for another meal and prevented the whole issue and where I\u2019m from the server doesn\u2019t come and check on you, so if you have an issue get off your ass and use your words like a big boy, but instead he made a fool of himself. Being argumentative all depends on how the bf actually asked, if he was rude and demanding then I don\u2019t blame the server so none of that is really relevant to the story", "Eating in America sounds wild. 1. Order the right food and this issue becomes non-existent.  \n2. The guy was clearly out of line, if you take a bite, you're paying for the meal, that's the deal.  \nIt's like they think people owe them for dining there, instead of being grateful someone is providing a service.", ">He usually doesn\u2019t have any issues with waitstaff and does tip well. He does get a little irritated when things go wrong though.\n\nConsider this insight into your future with him. You are a decade older, a little wrinklier and have a few extra pounds on. You don't have as much time to put into your appearance due to being the primary caregiver of your children and your crappy job that fits around school hours. \n\nHe comes home and the place doesn't sparkle and dinner is running 20 minutes late, but the bread is already a bit burnt on the edges. Rather than rolling up his sleeves and helping, he sits on the lounge scrolling through channels and complaining at you.\n\nWelcome to BEING the waitstaff. See how 'occasional' the problem is then.", "In the US, 20% is standard now. Not sure where they are", "I disagree with your second point - if someone takes one or two bites before realizing the food is actually bad, it should be free. World-wide, you don\u2019t pay for inedible food you barely touched. Eat more than that and then yeah, it was obviously good enough that you should pay.  \n\nAnd also, yeah, don\u2019t ever order seafood from a place that doesn\u2019t specialize in seafood. That\u2019s absolutely universal.", "I\u2019m with you man and I think we might be from the same place. I would have thought that five bucks would be heaps in a \u2018tipping country\u2019. Isn\u2019t it supposed to be that much, it\u2019s just like a little extra on the side right, just a few bucks, whatever change you have or something? Are people in the US seriously paying an extra twenty bucks on top of their food, because if they don\u2019t they get harassed about it? Anyway what do they do to tip when you pay with your phone like we all do?", "20% for bad service?", "\u201cButtfuck\u201d really?", "Uh, is that not what we were talking about? OP says 10% is a bad tip. You want to leave a bad tip for bad service. Honestly, I would have left a penny. I was just providing context because you said 10% was a good tip outside the US, I was telling you what an acceptable tip is here.", "I think on a discount that makes sense,  having something taken off the bill because it was bad seems like a weird thing to tip on?", "YTA for blaming your embarrassment on your bf. Bad food needs to be complained about. Because you're uncomfortable in that situation isn't his fault. He ordered something that he thought would be good but it was so bad he couldn't eat it, the restaurant needs to be responsible for the quality of food they serve. He tipped over 10% for a waiter that argued with him over the food and tipping isn't required, it's something you do for the quality service you receive and your bf thinks your waiter's service earned $5, you could have left more money if you thought the waiter earned it. Your bf stood up for himself and wasn't going to pay for bad food and service. You saying he shouldn't order it has nothing to do with the situation. Be happy you aren't dating a doormat and hopefully you thanked him for paying for your meal.", "Wait.... it cost more money to buy Wendy's than 3 shrimp tacos? OMG he better hope to not get food poisoning.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA, unless you stay with this loozer much longer.", "I think we can all agree that US tipping culture is the asshole here, because you got bad food and bad service, compounded by a bad reaction to being called out on bad food and bad service, and apparently you still feel like there's no possible way that you can not provide extra reward money on top of the (bad) food's list price without starving someone's kid.", "Seriously, my parents and I went to a *very* nice restaurant and my mom's fish was underdone and the sauce was overdone and instead of whining to the table she flagged our server and said \"Excuse me, sir?\" and told him the issue with her salmon dish and he whisked it to the kitchen and brought her a replacement on the fly and everyone was happy without being rude or annoying because customers are supposed to *communicate* any dissatisfaction to their servers because it is *their job* to fix it. There's no reason to be dick about it.", "I\u2019m reminded of the John Mulaney SNL sketch about ordering lobster at a diner with this one\u2026", "Just a hole in the wall place that probably doesn\u2019t sell a lot of shrimp. The shrimp had a gummy texture according to my bf. They didn\u2019t look like full shrimp to me either. Almost like chopped up bits of shrimp. I advised him not to order that.", "No racial bias. If our local hot dog stand started serving filet mignon, I\u2019d say the same thing.", "If I have bad food, I either wave down the server or go to the bar and ask that they send the server to me. I don't wait until the check comes. There's no reason that the bf couldn't do the same.   \nAnd he'd of had time to get something different.", "If you are suspicious of a Mexican restaurant's ability to make shrimp tacos, you have a problem. Mexico is not a landlocked country.", "In Canada lots of restaurants have tip out on the total of the bill so ten percent leaves pretty much zero to the server anyways (tip outs are usually anywhere from 5.5 percent up to ten depending on the restaurant). I'm not sure if US does tip outs.", "I am suspicious of the Mexican place in rural Americas ability to make shrimp tacos. There\u2019s a difference", "WHAT???? 20% in the US???? omg. this is horrible. \n\nWhy don't restaurant owners just raise the salary and food price? at least it's not a \"depends if the customer isn't a jerk\" amount.", "I was just going to say something similar. Depends on the restaurant, but a lot in the US  have to tip out as well, so it\u2019s possible this server lost money on this table (if tip outs are the case).", "Servers need to actually check on their tables for that opportunity to arise, and servers who don't do their job don't get good tips.", "Then he was right to not want to eat them and ask to have them taken off the bill.", "Tipping culture is a joke but anecdotally you\u2019ll find many servers prefer it because they make more overall this way", "I genuinely don\u2019t think this was racism - there are Mexican restaurants where I get seafood, and Mexican restaurants where I would never get seafood. I only get seafood at places that specifically sell lots of seafood, because room-temperature-all-day shrimp just doesn\u2019t agree with me.", "You're repeating yourself. The comment you're replying to predicted your reply.", "10% is not a \u201cbad\u201d tip it might be a bit under the expectation but it\u2019s not terrible or even automatically an indictment on the service or anything", "This. They make a lot more and (from my friends) they don't declare cash tips for taxes. So it helps their overall income a lot.", "Uh, yes it absolutely is a bad tip. If I were a server and received 10 percent, I would immediately assume that something was wrong with my service or the meal.", "Unless it\u2019s the sunday morning church crowd, it absolutely is a bad tip, and I would be wondering what I did wrong", "oh... this makes so much sense... it's non taxable.... \n\nBut it must suck if you're not certain of your monthly income.", "LMFAO", "I was actually a server for many years, it wasn\u2019t that long ago 10% was the norm. Lots of people still tip less than 20%. It\u2019s silly to think 10% or 15% means your service was shitty. \u201cTip creep\u201d in the last few years has been ridiculous", "Did you not read? The service WAS terrible. The waiter was argumentative when told by the customer he didn\u2019t enjoy his meal, never checked in on them while they were eating, etc.. not to mention if the girlfriend had such a problem with it she could have chipped in another $5. He payed for everything so how does this OP have the audacity to say it\u2019s not good enough.", "It\u2019s definitely not \u201cnon-taxable.\u201d Those who don\u2019t report their cash tips are committing fraud. Also screwing themselves if they want to take out a loan for a house or even a car someday because they\u2019re not reporting their full income, therefore, the lender can only qualify them for a loan based on what their reported income is.", "Did you read? I didn't say anything about OP's situation. 10 percent is a bad tip. The server in the OP appears to have deserved the bad tip. We don't disagree on that. I was replying to the poster who said 10 percent wasn't a bad tip.", "Thanks for clearing it up for me! I don't understand tipping culture."]}
