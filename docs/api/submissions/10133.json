This just happened like an hour ago. We meet eachother for lunch a lot. Today we went to this mexican place we\u2019ve gone to a few times before and had pretty good food.\n\nThe short of it is my boyfriend wanted shrimp tacos. Not to be bogus or anything but I\u2019m sure you all know the type of place I\u2019m talking about. I advised him that getting shrimp probably wasn\u2019t the best idea. He insisted on wanting shrimp tacos though.\n\nNaturally, he said they were terrible. I looked at them and they did not look good so I believed him. He ate like half of one taco out of the 3 it came with it. He was voicing his displeasure the whole time but he had no time to order again because he needed to get back to work.\n\nWhen the check came, he said told the server that the tacos were terrible. And the evidence is right there that he only ate half of one taco. He told the server he won\u2019t be paying for the tacos. He said he will be paying cash, and he will pay for my food, the guacamole we got as an appetizer and the margaritas. But he will not be paying for the tacos.\n\nThe server got a manager who eventually agreed to take the tacos off of the bill. He paid for what he said he\u2019d pay for, left a crappy tip (5$ on a 44$ bill), and we left. I told him he embarrassed me, and he should have listened to me in the first place. He was angry saying now he has to spend more money to pickup wendy\u2019s on his way to work.\n\nHe justified his poor tip by saying the server tried to tell him he needed to pay for the food he didn\u2019t eat so the server is lucky to get what he got. I still think he brought this upon himself so I am mad. I told him again this is his fault and he had no reason to act like a jerk to the server and embarrass me.

The server can agree or get a manager, then the problem is ideally solved, the server gets an appropriate tip because it isn't their fault the food wasn't good, and we all move on. \n\nInstead, your boyfriend sat around complaining to you instead of the server, and then just ordered the server around in what I feel is an impolite way, then left a poor tip because HE didn't convey his issue appropriately. \n\nI'd be embarrassed too, not because he ordered the shrimp tacos, but he failed to adult in what is a basic scenario, albeit a mildly uncomfortable one, and his approach made it more uncomfortable.", "NTA. Maybe you should call Wendy's and warn them that he's on the way.", "NTA \n\nAnyone who is rude to servers or restaurant workers isn't a good person.\n\nThe server didn't buy the meal ingredients or cook them. It wasn't their fault the tacos were bad. \n\nIt's also rude to argue with a manager about not paying. If you're told no, then you pay and don't go back if you don't want to. Most restaurants will either remake the food or give you something else, but not necessarily refund you.", "Esh you could have left a bigger tip after him", "Info: are you saying that him saying he won't pay for food he didn't eat was him being rude? Why didn't you pay for your food or part of the tip?", "NTA. And your bf isn\u2019t wrong for not paying for the tacos\u2014but he should have told the waiter earlier on that the tacos were not edible and he needed a replacement (or if they didn\u2019t have time, just stick with what was already ordered).  You can\u2019t wait until the end of lunch and then refuse to pay for something. \n\nAlso, the bad food is not linked to the waitstaff so he should have tipped well, still.", "NTA that would be a deal breaker for me. The way someone treats waitstaff is really telling. He made it their problem because he didn't like something. Then didn't tip???", "ESH\n\nYour boyfriend can order what he wants and absolutely ought to talk to a manager if he is dissatisfied with the food, the experience, or whatever. Nobody should have to pay for food at a restaurant if it was terrible and uneaten.\n\nYour boyfriend should still tip the server. they bring the food; they don't buy it or cook it. They pay their bills with tips. Stiffing a server changes nothing about the restaurant. It only fucks over someone who's primary job is to take orders and carry plates. It is possible to discuss dissatisfaction with a manager and having your way without being an asshole.", "NTA. \nHe caused a scene. He needs to be more prepared for where he's eating. Besides, what does not liking something have to do with tip. That's just cruel on his part.", "YTA - he doesn\u2019t need to listen to you about what food to order. Many people order things, find out they aren\u2019t good, and send it back/ask for it to be taken off the bill. Also just assuming something won\u2019t be good based on the looks of a restaurant is weird. If you get that vibe, why are you eating there anyway? There are plenty of dive restaurants with amazing food. He literally paid for your food. If you had a problem with it you should have offered to pay for his tacos and left a bigger tip. You can be annoyed with his behavior, but take a deep breath, shrug it off, and let him go back to work. He didn\u2019t do anything wrong and you shouldn\u2019t be starting a dumb fight over it.", "ESH.  A good partner lets their partner know when they messed up, which you did.  He had no right taking it out on the server that he was pissed about his food.  And servers remember shitty tippers better than good ones.\n\nThe only reason I'm also including you is that \"he brought it on himself.\"  He should be able to get what he wants without your judgment because it's frankly immaterial.  He knows his preferences better than you do.", "NAH. If a restaurant puts it on their menu, they should stand behind the quality of the food. Asking for a bad meal to be taken off a bill is confrontational, but it's a fairly reasonable thing to ask. \n\nThat's a pretty bad tip, but it's still 11% so if this isn't typically how he acts/tips I would let it go.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with trying something new, the taste of food can be very subjective and if he didn\u2019t eat most of it, restaurants usually come up with some solution to accommodate for that (such as taking it off the bill)\n\nHowever the way you describe it make it sound like he had an attitude about getting something he didn\u2019t like, which is not cool\n\nNTA\n\n(Also if you felt uneasy about the tip he left, you can always leave some of your own money too)", "YTA.\n\nIt's a reasonable assumption that food at a restaurant will be safe for consumption, even if shrimp quality can be inconsistent.\n\nYou seem to be pressing him to admit you were right and he was wrong.\n\nHe got fed bad food, went hungry, had a bad time and you think you're the victim for being 'embarrassed'.", "NTA He sounds difficult to be around. While it's fine to not like your food, waiting for the check and then arguing with the waiter isn't the way to address it. \nHe did act like a jerk in the restaurant.", "15% of 44.00 is about 7.00 so the tip wasn't the worst!!!", "NTA. \n\nYou told him, he didn't listen. \n\nThen he made everything uncomfortable by looking for a reason to leave a bad tip.\n\nHe's the shocked pikachu face of hungry human beings and you're the Cassandra of seafood tacos.", "Nta ask him why he didn\u2019t listen", "NTA.

Why should he pay for food that wasn\u2019t even made properly. You sound like a nasty person", "YTA. Correct me if I'm wrong, but if the inquiry is about the \"Poor Tip\"; a $5 tip for a bad experience at a restaurant is more decent than most people (A lot will rudely not tip at all, even with excellent food and service). You seem fixated that he \"brought this upon himself.\" Just because you think a meal item is unappetizing **does not make it unappetizing**. Some food sounds disgusting, but turns out is delightful. I on one hand *love* shrimp tacos. Why should a person expect them to be horrible because you generalize it to be?\n\nAnother matter: If you do not like the tip, **then you tip**.

Part of running a business is dealing with a loss when you don't meet customer expectations. He only ate half a taco. I wouldn't have paid for that either. Granted I would have also brought to the staff attention ass soon as I knew it was gross and tried something else, but it doesn't matter. When a restaurant serves you gross food, you are allowed to complain and let them know. Unless he was shouting and cussing at the staff, he did nothing wrong. \n\nPeople are allowed to have grievances and complain about businesses when the businesses fail.
