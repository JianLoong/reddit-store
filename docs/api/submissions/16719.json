This worked for some time with no issues until about 3 months ago when she hit rock bottom. She informed me that she could no longer afford to pay rent. At the same time, it was her birthday so I told her that I would give her one month free from rent for her birthday. The following month, she was still struggling which I hate to see, so I made a deal that if she didnt pay rent again that she would use the rent money to put towards her debt. She agreed. Now it is month three. \n\nShe recently downloaded Tinder & allowed a random guy into my home to sleep with him. Now, she is pregnant, after not taking her birth control correctly, not wearing a condom, & not making the man pull out. She has told me that she wants to keep the child. I only have one other room as a guest room & she wants to use that room as the nursery. I mentioned having the childs crib in her room as to keep the guest room for family/friends to come stay & help with the child or just if they needed it, but she was very unhappy about this option & did not want to give up her room for the child. Over the last few months I have had tens of thousands of dollars worth of problems arise to include having to get a brand new roof, etc. Now, with all the extra payments I have, on top of my sister no longer being able to pay rent, & a soon to be newborn, I will likely have to sell my house to be able to afford to take care of my sister & her newborn.

Please, kick her out now.  You won't be able to make yourself do it after she has the kid.  NTA.  Why should you pay for your sister's life choices?", "Holy shit, your sister put you in an awful situation.\n\nNTA\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful that you want to help, but you should not have to sell your home to support her.  You should not have to work extra to support her.\n\nSit her down, tell her the situation you are in and give her the options (do NOT offer to sell your house to support her). Then hold her to it.", "In what world would it make you the asshole to remove an inconsiderate freeloader out of your home? Her behavior was reckless and it is time for baby bird to fly.\n\n...I already explained this to you on the phone two hours ago.", "NTA. Look, you are not financially responsible for your sister, and it's clear she's taking advantage of your kindness.  I would put money on it that she's *expecting* you to pay for not only her needs, but the baby's as well. With that in mind, I would definitely encourage you to give her notice to move out, regardless of her ability to pay rent. It's just not your job to pay for her and her baby, not your obligation, and your sister will learn nothing if you continue to pay her way.  You are young and just starting out yourself, you don't need this financial burden that will hinder your own personal financial growth.\n\nYour sister is an adult and needs to figure this out for herself. Maybe she moves to wherever your parents live. Otherwise I would shift your help to strictly helping her find financial aid resources and housing", "NTA. She needs to move out now so she can learn to be a parent *before* that poor child gets here. If you're in the US, there's pregnant mothers Medicaid and she can get housing assistance. Or she can move to live with your parents. *You* are not her parent. But if you don't get her out now, you never will. This is not a good situation, and the fact that she thinks that you should give her the larger period your house that you pay for entirely tells me that she has long-term plans to live there and zero plans to pay.\n\nYou're her income, Sweetie. Get her out now. When the baby comes, she'll dig in like a tick.", "As she is not working there is no need for her to stay with you, she can move back to your parents and you can take a paying roommate to help you with the costs.\n\nNTA", "NTA. she has made bad decision after bad decision, and you have gone above and beyond to help her out. now she is trying to take over your life, but if you put yourself in a less stable position because of her choices, you would only be an AH to yourself.", "NTA\n\nThe most you should be willing to do as her sister, is find her another living situation and help her set it up (since it seems like she's incapable responsibly doing it herself). This is the best way to ensure that you don't get your life further ruined by her and you know she will be safe enough to live out her very poor choices.   \nPlease remember that she honestly disrespected you and your home. A considerate person wouldn't bring strangers into another person's home who is helping them out in so many ways. She just assumed that your extra guest room was her's to keep and turn into a nursery?? She isn't even paying rent for the room she currently has! She's not as great of a sister or person as you may think she is. See the reality of the situation because she will only continue to dig herself deeper and she wants to drag you down with her.", "NTA. You should not have to pay the price for her shitty decisions.", "NTA. \n\nYou should look after you. There's only a 4 year age gap between you, your sister is not a child she's an adult and needs to be making adult choices. \n\nYou say \"never want to see anyone else struggle or have hardships if I can help in some way\". but if helping her Tanks your life you have done just that to yourself (losing your house and working yourself to death is the epitome of \"struggle & hardship\") and for what. It'll drag on for years with excuses for not paying a share of rent (after the house has gone) and living expenses because of \"the baby\". \n\nYour sister needs a wake-up call.

She got pregnant on purpose because she doesn't want to pay rent. \n\nShe can't pay rent even though she has a job? $14/hour at 40 hours is at least $1800/month after taxes. Are you seriously thinking about selling your house so you can play pretend baby daddy for your sister? What is wrong in your life? Do not do this. OP, what is going on with you?", "NTA.  There is a line that I've seen people use in Reddit posts:  \"Don't set yourself on fire to keep another warm\".  You sacrificing your house is NOT the answer.  Your sister made these choices and I know you don't want to turn your back but you're on a path to being completely responsible for your sister AND her baby.  She's had NO respect for your house or you.  She needs to get a job and start thinking of her future or get out ASAP.", "NTA - Don't ruin your life because of her bad choices. She's an adult and not your responsibility.", "NTA and you need to realise that she got pregnant on purpose so that she doesn't have to face her debt.

Or back in with your parents.\n\nYou are not her mum, and you are not her child\u2019s other parent. I can guarantee you, that if she stays with you and has the baby there, you\u2019ll end up doing most of the baby duty as well.\n\nAs for baby daddy, not knowing him well enough did phase her when she was having unprotected sex with him.

She doesn\u2019t have to become his girlfriend but she needs to sit down with him and work out the custody and support legalities asap. She should look up the family court in her area and call for legal help. She will need to do this whether she likes it or not because the state will insist that she pursue support as a condition of any aid. \n\nIf she is low income she needs to look into SNAP and WIC and daycare assistance.\n\nYou need to get her to move back in with her parents or see what she can work out with the baby\u2019s father.

She has a rent free room she can share with her baby, if she wants more space she can move out.", "YWNBTA - I'd sacrifice the guest room and bring another roommate into offset costs.

What the hell autocorrect.", "I didn\u2019t say you shouldn\u2019t kick her out I said it\u2019s well within your right too! I just think it would be an asshole thing to do- give her a little time to find a place to live and then have her leave IMO. But do what you want clearly my take is not a popular opinion", "I suppose that\u2019s true. But the question isn\u2019t - is this situation what\u2019s best for me? The question is \u201cam I the asshole\u201d and yeah I think putting a pregnant sister on the street is something I would never do and would be an asshole if I did", "Thanks, thought it was 21 and attending college.", "Very true.", "Yeah, this is very short term thinking. OP is setting themselves on fire to keep sister warm and there will be nothing left if she and the child need help later. It's far better to make sister struggle now (and hopefully learn to help herself) with OP in a secure position to catch her if she falls too far then to be stumbling alongside her, poor, and with no resources to take care of emergencies. NTA", "Yep sister will never even try to change if she\u2019s constantly being enabled by OP. Why get a job, OP will pay for everything?"]}
