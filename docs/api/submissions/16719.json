This worked for some time with no issues until about 3 months ago when she hit rock bottom. She informed me that she could no longer afford to pay rent. At the same time, it was her birthday so I told her that I would give her one month free from rent for her birthday. The following month, she was still struggling which I hate to see, so I made a deal that if she didnt pay rent again that she would use the rent money to put towards her debt. She agreed. Now it is month three. \n\nShe recently downloaded Tinder & allowed a random guy into my home to sleep with him.

I mentioned having the childs crib in her room as to keep the guest room for family/friends to come stay & help with the child or just if they needed it, but she was very unhappy about this option & did not want to give up her room for the child.

Please, kick her out now.  You won't be able to make yourself do it after she has the kid.  NTA.  Why should you pay for your sister's life choices?", "Holy shit, your sister put you in an awful situation.\n\nNTA\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful that you want to help, but you should not have to sell your home to support her.  You should not have to work extra to support her.\n\nSit her down, tell her the situation you are in and give her the options (do NOT offer to sell your house to support her). Then hold her to it.", "In what world would it make you the asshole to remove an inconsiderate freeloader out of your home? Her behavior was reckless and it is time for baby bird to fly.\n\n...I already explained this to you on the phone two hours ago.", "NTA. Look, you are not financially responsible for your sister, and it's clear she's taking advantage of your kindness.  I would put money on it that she's *expecting* you to pay for not only her needs, but the baby's as well. With that in mind, I would definitely encourage you to give her notice to move out, regardless of her ability to pay rent. It's just not your job to pay for her and her baby, not your obligation, and your sister will learn nothing if you continue to pay her way.  You are young and just starting out yourself, you don't need this financial burden that will hinder your own personal financial growth.\n\nYour sister is an adult and needs to figure this out for herself. Maybe she moves to wherever your parents live. Otherwise I would shift your help to strictly helping her find financial aid resources and housing", "NTA. She needs to move out now so she can learn to be a parent *before* that poor child gets here. If you're in the US, there's pregnant mothers Medicaid and she can get housing assistance. Or she can move to live with your parents. *You* are not her parent. But if you don't get her out now, you never will. This is not a good situation, and the fact that she thinks that you should give her the larger period your house that you pay for entirely tells me that she has long-term plans to live there and zero plans to pay.\n\nYou're her income, Sweetie. Get her out now. When the baby comes, she'll dig in like a tick.", "As she is not working there is no need for her to stay with you, she can move back to your parents and you can take a paying roommate to help you with the costs.\n\nNTA", "NTA. she has made bad decision after bad decision, and you have gone above and beyond to help her out. now she is trying to take over your life, but if you put yourself in a less stable position because of her choices, you would only be an AH to yourself.", "NTA\n\nThe most you should be willing to do as her sister, is find her another living situation and help her set it up (since it seems like she's incapable responsibly doing it herself). This is the best way to ensure that you don't get your life further ruined by her and you know she will be safe enough to live out her very poor choices.   \nPlease remember that she honestly disrespected you and your home. A considerate person wouldn't bring strangers into another person's home who is helping them out in so many ways. She just assumed that your extra guest room was her's to keep and turn into a nursery?? She isn't even paying rent for the room she currently has! She's not as great of a sister or person as you may think she is. See the reality of the situation because she will only continue to dig herself deeper and she wants to drag you down with her.", "NTA. You should not have to pay the price for her shitty decisions.", "NTA. \n\nYou should look after you. There's only a 4 year age gap between you, your sister is not a child she's an adult and needs to be making adult choices. \n\nYou say \"never want to see anyone else struggle or have hardships if I can help in some way\". but if helping her Tanks your life you have done just that to yourself (losing your house and working yourself to death is the epitome of \"struggle & hardship\") and for what. It'll drag on for years with excuses for not paying a share of rent (after the house has gone) and living expenses because of \"the baby\". \n\nYour sister needs a wake-up call.

She got pregnant on purpose because she doesn't want to pay rent. \n\nShe can't pay rent even though she has a job? $14/hour at 40 hours is at least $1800/month after taxes. Are you seriously thinking about selling your house so you can play pretend baby daddy for your sister? What is wrong in your life? Do not do this. OP, what is going on with you?", "NTA.  There is a line that I've seen people use in Reddit posts:  \"Don't set yourself on fire to keep another warm\".  You sacrificing your house is NOT the answer.  Your sister made these choices and I know you don't want to turn your back but you're on a path to being completely responsible for your sister AND her baby.  She's had NO respect for your house or you.  She needs to get a job and start thinking of her future or get out ASAP.", "NTA - Don't ruin your life because of her bad choices. She's an adult and not your responsibility.", "NTA and you need to realise that she got pregnant on purpose so that she doesn't have to face her debt.

Or back in with your parents.\n\nYou are not her mum, and you are not her child\u2019s other parent. I can guarantee you, that if she stays with you and has the baby there, you\u2019ll end up doing most of the baby duty as well.\n\nAs for baby daddy, not knowing him well enough did phase her when she was having unprotected sex with him.

She doesn\u2019t have to become his girlfriend but she needs to sit down with him and work out the custody and support legalities asap. She should look up the family court in her area and call for legal help. She will need to do this whether she likes it or not because the state will insist that she pursue support as a condition of any aid. \n\nIf she is low income she needs to look into SNAP and WIC and daycare assistance.\n\nYou need to get her to move back in with her parents or see what she can work out with the baby\u2019s father.

She has a rent free room she can share with her baby, if she wants more space she can move out.", "YWNBTA - I'd sacrifice the guest room and bring another roommate into offset costs.

If you get rid of that house, who knows if/when you'll ever be able to afford a new one, because you couldn't afford that house at today's mortgage rates.  You have a very valuable asset; don't let her steal it from you.", "Exactly. OP buy her a bus tickets to your parents and be done. She and her mistakes are not your problem to solve.", "Yes, this. It will be INFINITELY harder for you to ask your sister and niece/nephew to leave once they arrive.", "She has no plans on getting a job or she would already have one. OP would probably raising her niece/nephew and pay for everything. Kicking her out is the necessary thing to do. NTA", "Tell her to move in with the parents and get help from baby\u2019s father. This is the best way for you.\n\nAnd get a stable housemate.", "Fr! OP is potentially going to be homeless to help their sister? Setting yourself on fire to help a burn victim isn't the way to go. You can't help others by putting yourself in their situation.", "Has the sister considered maybe putting the baby up for adoption?  I doubt she will be able to care for him/her or raise a child well.\n\nThere are adoption programs that will let the birth mother meet the child when they are 18 if the child wants to.\n\nOP, if you sell your house to try and help your sister, you will ALL drown.  You, your sister, AND that poor child, who deserves a better parent than your sister.", "\u261d\ud83c\udfff\u261d\ud83c\udfff\u261d\ud83c\udfff\u261d\ud83c\udfff\u261d\ud83c\udfff\u261d\ud83c\udfff", "Yo, OP: NTA, and if this person is your friend IRL, PLEASE listen to them!", "Hopefully you and the other people in her life sit her down and talk to her about how she\u2019s selling herself out for no reward. He sister needs to be able to provide for her baby eventually, and she\u2019s had plenty of time to prepare and save.", "Sister needs to get off her ass and take care of things. It\u2019s not fair to OP. OP can assist her in filing out online applications for SNAP and WIC.", "This. This right here. Exactly.   \nI doubt anyone has had a real conversation with the sister about anything TBH ...", "This is the answer \u2b06\ufe0f", "Finally!  Adoption is mentioned!  I wondered how far down i\u2019d Have to read to find this.", "I somewhat doubt this person would be considered a good teacher with the fucking blatantly stupid decisions they've made thus far.", "For real. Who the f would sell their dream house to support freeloader?", "This!  Just for bringing home some rando would have been enough for me to send her packing.", ">cause girl is gonna be hunting for cash\n\nNot sure where OP is but it\u2019s likely perfectly legal to negotiate a keys for cash agreement. While it is of course shitty to OP because she\u2019s already been far more generous than needed, this might be the least stressful & emotionally draining option. Inform your sister that you will either go through the legal eviction proceedings which can take months, depending on your area and how far along she is she might give birth during this time! Moving with a newborn is going to be that much more difficult and stressful. Frame it as the best option for her as well. Instead OP is willing to offer $xxx to help her get on her feet elsewhere, and settle in before the baby arrives. If she accepts the money she has to be moved out by (end of the week/month/whatever OP chooses). Maybe her baby daddy can have her crash with him until she gets a new place (we both know that\u2019s never going to happen lol, but then she can be his problem instead).\n\nIt\u2019s shitty and OP might not even be able to afford to do this, but if they can this will be the best way to keep relationships intact. Of course on Reddit it\u2019s easy to say to cut off shitty family members, but irl people don\u2019t do that quite so quickly or easily. Doing a cash for keys offer is the fastest way to get rid of an unwanted tenant, and OP won\u2019t have to feel any guilt whatsoever. If any of her family members try, she can very clearly put them in their place \u201cI gave little sis $xx to get started as an independent mother. It is not my responsibility to coparent with her. I gave her a generous amount to land on her feet, and she can now grow up.\u201d", "And once sis is out, OP needs to carefully select a paying roommate to move in.  The extra cash will help with her bills and the roommate will prevent sis from moving back in.", "The conversation needs to be that OP is barely making it and may lose the house so Sid must pay rent and her share of expenses or she needs to move out so OP can get a roommate who will pay rent to help make up for the budget shortfall created by sister.\n\nShe can move back home with parents, with baby daddy, or get a job that asap that will slow her to get her own place. \n\nSubstitute teaching is the work SAHMs with a money-bucks husband do to get their foot in the door and go full time when the kids start school. She needs to look into the full time path", "And OP getting a second weekend job while the sister slacks!", "yup, my sister likes to have all kinds of random ass people around her children. i do not. she asked to move in with me a few years ago and i told her \u201cif you move in, i don\u2019t want any of your friends in my house. i don\u2019t know them and don\u2019t want them around my child.\u201d (it was just me an my oldest at the time so i had the room). she wasn\u2019t happy bc i \u201cknew\u201d her friends, we went to hs with the people she hangs out with but i joined the navy within months of graduation and left a month after my 19th birthday. i haven\u2019t spent a single second or had a conversation with any of those people since i left almost 7 years ago and moved back 3 years ago, so no i do not know those people. i told her she could accept the house rules or find somewhere else to live. she tried crying to our mom but my mom told her \u201cjust because *you* trust everyone you meet, doesn\u2019t mean your sister does. if she doesn\u2019t want random people in her house and around her daughter then you have to live with that if you want to live in *her* house.\u201d she quickly decided to shut up and take my offer", "Same.  That is reeaaally not okay!", "A cliche, but true, statement we use in our house with our children\u2026Necessity is the Mother of Invention. When you have no other option but to figure something out, you find a way. We are still a safety net, but do not cross into enabling. \n\nOP is helping honestly because it makes HER feel better, but it\u2019s only keeping sister exactly where she\u2019s at and not improving. Her sister might be pissed, but OP needs to be able to live her own life.", "Sister can have many more!"]}
