Why should you pay for your sister's life choices?", "Holy shit, your sister put you in an awful situation.\n\nNTA\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful that you want to help, but you should not have to sell your home to support her.  You should not have to work extra to support her.\n\nSit her down, tell her the situation you are in and give her the options (do NOT offer to sell your house to support her). Then hold her to it.", "In what world would it make you the asshole to remove an inconsiderate freeloader out of your home?

Look, you are not financially responsible for your sister, and it's clear she's taking advantage of your kindness.  I would put money on it that she's *expecting* you to pay for not only her needs, but the baby's as well. With that in mind, I would definitely encourage you to give her notice to move out, regardless of her ability to pay rent. It's just not your job to pay for her and her baby, not your obligation, and your sister will learn nothing if you continue to pay her way.  You are young and just starting out yourself, you don't need this financial burden that will hinder your own personal financial growth.\n\nYour sister is an adult and needs to figure this out for herself. Maybe she moves to wherever your parents live. Otherwise I would shift your help to strictly helping her find financial aid resources and housing", "NTA. She needs to move out now so she can learn to be a parent *before* that poor child gets here. If you're in the US, there's pregnant mothers Medicaid and she can get housing assistance. Or she can move to live with your parents. *You* are not her parent. But if you don't get her out now, you never will. This is not a good situation, and the fact that she thinks that you should give her the larger period your house that you pay for entirely tells me that she has long-term plans to live there and zero plans to pay.\n\nYou're her income, Sweetie.

This is the best way to ensure that you don't get your life further ruined by her and you know she will be safe enough to live out her very poor choices.   \nPlease remember that she honestly disrespected you and your home. A considerate person wouldn't bring strangers into another person's home who is helping them out in so many ways. She just assumed that your extra guest room was her's to keep and turn into a nursery?? She isn't even paying rent for the room she currently has! She's not as great of a sister or person as you may think she is.

There is a line that I've seen people use in Reddit posts:  \"Don't set yourself on fire to keep another warm\".  You sacrificing your house is NOT the answer.  Your sister made these choices and I know you don't want to turn your back but you're on a path to being completely responsible for your sister AND her baby.

I can guarantee you, that if she stays with you and has the baby there, you\u2019ll end up doing most of the baby duty as well.\n\nAs for baby daddy, not knowing him well enough did phase her when she was having unprotected sex with him.

She doesn\u2019t have to become his girlfriend but she needs to sit down with him and work out the custody and support legalities asap. She should look up the family court in her area and call for legal help. She will need to do this whether she likes it or not because the state will insist that she pursue support as a condition of any aid. \n\nIf she is low income she needs to look into SNAP and WIC and daycare assistance.\n\nYou need to get her to move back in with her parents or see what she can work out with the baby\u2019s father.

She is taking advantage of the fact that your her sister and you will always be there to help her that's why she's not worried or doing something to help her situation", "NTA: What you have already done is above and beyond!\n\nYou should *not* sacrifice your life goals and dreams for others. \n\nIf she isn\u2019t working she can find work, there are tons of WFH jobs and get a place for herself. IF you feel like helping you could help her look for an inexpensive place.", "Don't light yourself on fire to keep someone warm. \n\nYou soon won't be in a position to help anybody if you keep this up. Stop enabling your sister.", "Sell your house to take care of who?! You must be out of your damn mind. You\u2019re NTA unless you actually do that. Give your sister notice to vacate.", "Look, this is going to be harsh but you need to kick your sister out. She is taking complete advantage of you and your are hugely enabling her to continue to be irresponsible. She doesn\u2019t want to give up part of her room for her baby? Does she understand that babies come with even bigger sacrifices? You need to kick her out before you end up raising her kid for her too. Do not burn yourself alive to keep others warm.", "NTA.  From your description of the situation, it doesn't sound like your sister has made good choices, nor does it sound like she's stepping up to take responsibility of those choices and working on making better choices going forward.  It would be one thing if she was pulling her weight and was unable to stay afloat due to external circumstances.  There's that saying of not setting yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.  Why should you do more to help her (and at great personal sacrifice) than she's doing to help herself and her baby on the way?", "NTA.\n\nYou have done more than enought trying to help your irresponsible, immature and ungrateful freeloader of a sister. \n\nEncourage your sister to apply for all the welfare support that she is entitled to as a pregnant unmarried woman and encourage her to get specialist advice about child support & how to pay her baby's medical expenses.", "NTA she needs to go.  You have given her so many opportunities, and she has squandered them all, and continues to make very poor life decisions.  It sounds like it's time for her to pack up and move back in with your parents, or a friend's, or anywhere but with you.  She has exhausted your patience and your resources and your goodwill.", "NTA. \n\nYou need to put your foot fully down, and do it now. You do not need to give up your life or even your comfort, for your sister. And when you feel bad about that, realize you have already been a great help to her, and that she is making it clear she doesn't care about your future or happiness, because she is making selfish choices \n\nSo step one- tell her she has 30 days to get a job that pays the rent, or she needs to leave. Tell her you will help her get to wherever your parents are, or to some other friend or relative, but you will not continue to support her. \n\nStep two- you are not helping her financially with her child, nor are you giving up another room to her and her child. Be clear that the support you are giving her is that she can stay in your home at the very low rent you are already charging her. Once she has a child, she is expected to pay the rent and you aren't providing childcare and she needs to be able to pay for her child. Tell her there is nothing else you can do for her and she needs to realize that. \n\nStep three- stick with what you said. She needs to understand how much shit costs, and how hard this is going to be able to do alone. It is very clear she has no understanding of what her life is going to be like, nor does she care about the impact on you. You have to stand up for yourself.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is not helping herself and in turn is stalling your life! She knows you'll be there for her so hence why she's probably not too worried about her latest string of decisions. Do kick her out, send her to her baby daddy or your parents, because her problems should not be yours!\n\nI'ts beyond me as to why people who are in a bad situation then decide to have a baby, especially from ONS!", "NTA\n\nThis entire situation is difficult to understand, I can only imagine that you and your sister are **extremely close** for you to be considering selling your home to support her and the baby.  \nYou're for some reason taking on the role of 'baby daddy' to her child. You should not sell your home. You should not allow her to turn your guest room into a nursery, babies get on just fine sleeping in the same bedroom as their parent/s. Why does the baby need to be in a separate room? Does she not want it's cries to wake her?\n\nI wonder who will therefore be waking up in the middle of the night to tend to the baby. Actually, I don't wonder. It's you. It'll be you.\n\nGet her out while you still can. She's got roughly 9 months to figure something out.", "NTA. Ship her home to mom and dad. You are not required to take on the responsibility of an unemployed single mom, even if it\u2019s your sister.", "NTA", "The baby needs to be with the father as well. NTA", "ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOT. buy her a one way ticket to your parents\u2019 city and live your life. you deserve to reap the rewards of your life\u2019s hard work.", "NTA OP doesn't have to pay for the consequences of her sister's bad decision-making skills. She was old enough to graduate college, start a career and have an unplanned pregnancy. Meanwhile OP is the one bending over backwards, now putting yourself in a position of struggling and hardship. So who is supposed to bail out OP?", "Maybe temporarily rent out the guest bedroom? I'd tell her she has a week to contribute money wise or you'll both be homeless. NTA. Tell her the truth she needs to get her shit together or you're both in big trouble.", "YWNBTA, she's abusing your kindness and won't grow up and do something for her unless you stop helping her, it's sad but some people need a harsh wake up call to start being responsible for themselves", "NTA, please sit her down and tell her she has X amount of time to move you. She is your sister but she is also playing you. Are you really willing to support her and her child for the rest of your life? Forget about having your own life because she will always need you. Please don't allow her to stay. She made her choices, and now she needs to live with them.", "NTA.\n\nI've seen this saying time and time again, and it certainly applies - DO NOT SET YOURSELF ON FIRE TO KEEP OTHERS WARM.", "If she wants to spread her legs on tinder- then have her figure it out on her own. You wouldn\u2019t be the ass for kicking her out- in fact, you got lucky she didn\u2019t bring home some crazy person while you were asleep - at least , not yet\u2026", "You need to take care of yourself and make sure your financially stable before helping your sister.  If you sell the house you\u2019ll be in this position in a year but without the home. Keep your home. It will allow a fallback for your sister, who needs to figure things out.", "Listen, I'm sorry but you can't be her safety net all the time. If she is grown up to have a baby, she is grown up to support herself...NTA.  she needs to pay rent. She isn't saving the money. She isn't even trying. \nYour making a huge mistake supporting her.", "YTA if you keep enabling this freeloader. Grow a spine and kick her out.", "NTA. \u201cGet an abortion or get the hell out.\u201d And if she gets an abortion, be there to confirm it.\n\nYour sister needs consequences to her actions or she\u2019s just going to take over your house and turn it into her family\u2019s house. There\u2019s nothing stopping her from having more than one kid or letting her baby daddies move in.", "NTA.\n\nYou have a lot more patience than I do. I would have came to the point months ago that maybe she can\u2019t afford to live where you do and needs to move back to your hometown and live with your parents to get her feet under her. This is all pre pregnancy mind you. Now that this has happened I would 100% insist on it. 0% chance I\u2019d have a newborn keeping me up all night long for months on end. As much as I think helping family is important it is more important to take care of yourself and your life. If you can\u2019t do both then you need to pick you because no one else is going to.", "NTA and do not continue to support her unless you're signing on for the next 18 years. \n\n$14/hr isn't a lot, but it certainly seems like enough to pay *something* towards rent over 3 months. She's spending her money somewhere else because she's expecting you to pay her bills. \n\nThat expectation isn't changing unless you make sure it does by taking her safety net away unless she \"gets around to\" getting her shit together.", "\"but she was very unhappy about this option & did not want to give up her room for the child.\" So she doesn't want to give up her room for HER child, but she wants YOU to give up TWO rooms for her and her child? NTA.", "Look, you are young and sympathetic. I hate to say it, but you are a great mark for greedy selfish people like your sister. You don't want to see her fail? Why not? Why do you care more about her situation than she does?\n\nLook, sometimes people have to hit rock bottom to learn. Either your sister hits rock bottom, or you do. But one of you is going to. I like to tell people, \"never light yourself on fire to keep someone warm.\" You ARE about to light yourself on fire. She is young, underemployed, not paying rent and pregnant. You have done enough to subsidize her life, if you sell your home to support her, you are setting a standard she will become accustomed to. She doesn't need to grow up, because you will enable her. \n\nKICK HER OUT, OP! Do it now before the kid comes! NTA but you will be, to yourself, if you keep supporting her. Plenty of people with less support find a way to be a single mom. She and the baby daddy need to figure things out.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t make this mess and shouldn\u2019t suffer for it. She hasn\u2019t made one sensible choice.

Her heart is writing checks her bank account can't cash, and it's heartbreaking.\n\nOP is NTA, but the sister needs to learn NOW that she is not prepared...maybe move her back to mom and dad, whether she likes it or not...what she \"likes\" took a backseat to what her baby is going to need, and OP can't afford a baby on top of a baby mama.", ">At least it's not your kid?\n\nSister is irresponsible so it might as well be.
