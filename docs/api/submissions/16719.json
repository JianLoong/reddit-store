At the same time, my 22 year old sister was graduating college, with no money & no job & needed a place to stay. We agreed that she could move in with me, & after getting a job, would start paying rent until she got back on her feet. She got a job as a substitute teacher but was only making $14/hr. This worked for some time with no issues until about 3 months ago when she hit rock bottom. She informed me that she could no longer afford to pay rent. At the same time, it was her birthday so I told her that I would give her one month free from rent for her birthday. The following month, she was still struggling which I hate to see, so I made a deal that if she didnt pay rent again that she would use the rent money to put towards her debt. She agreed. Now it is month three. \n\nShe recently downloaded Tinder & allowed a random guy into my home to sleep with him. Now, she is pregnant, after not taking her birth control correctly, not wearing a condom, & not making the man pull out. She has told me that she wants to keep the child. I only have one other room as a guest room & she wants to use that room as the nursery. I mentioned having the childs crib in her room as to keep the guest room for family/friends to come stay & help with the child or just if they needed it, but she was very unhappy about this option & did not want to give up her room for the child. Over the last few months I have had tens of thousands of dollars worth of problems arise to include having to get a brand new roof, etc. Now, with all the extra payments I have, on top of my sister no longer being able to pay rent, & a soon to be newborn, I will likely have to sell my house to be able to afford to take care of my sister & her newborn. It is not my job but I dont want to see her fail. I want her to have a stable living situation. My parents live far from us & cannot afford to help, & although the baby daddy wants to be involved, she just met him & knows nothing about him or his living situation.

Why should you pay for your sister's life choices?", "Holy shit, your sister put you in an awful situation.\n\nNTA\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful that you want to help, but you should not have to sell your home to support her.  You should not have to work extra to support her.\n\nSit her down, tell her the situation you are in and give her the options (do NOT offer to sell your house to support her). Then hold her to it.", "In what world would it make you the asshole to remove an inconsiderate freeloader out of your home?

Look, you are not financially responsible for your sister, and it's clear she's taking advantage of your kindness.  I would put money on it that she's *expecting* you to pay for not only her needs, but the baby's as well. With that in mind, I would definitely encourage you to give her notice to move out, regardless of her ability to pay rent. It's just not your job to pay for her and her baby, not your obligation, and your sister will learn nothing if you continue to pay her way.  You are young and just starting out yourself, you don't need this financial burden that will hinder your own personal financial growth.\n\nYour sister is an adult and needs to figure this out for herself. Maybe she moves to wherever your parents live. Otherwise I would shift your help to strictly helping her find financial aid resources and housing", "NTA. She needs to move out now so she can learn to be a parent *before* that poor child gets here. If you're in the US, there's pregnant mothers Medicaid and she can get housing assistance. Or she can move to live with your parents. *You* are not her parent. But if you don't get her out now, you never will. This is not a good situation, and the fact that she thinks that you should give her the larger period your house that you pay for entirely tells me that she has long-term plans to live there and zero plans to pay.\n\nYou're her income, Sweetie. Get her out now.

This is the best way to ensure that you don't get your life further ruined by her and you know she will be safe enough to live out her very poor choices.   \nPlease remember that she honestly disrespected you and your home. A considerate person wouldn't bring strangers into another person's home who is helping them out in so many ways. She just assumed that your extra guest room was her's to keep and turn into a nursery?? She isn't even paying rent for the room she currently has! She's not as great of a sister or person as you may think she is. See the reality of the situation because she will only continue to dig herself deeper and she wants to drag you down with her.", "NTA. You should not have to pay the price for her shitty decisions.", "NTA. \n\nYou should look after you. There's only a 4 year age gap between you, your sister is not a child she's an adult and needs to be making adult choices. \n\nYou say \"never want to see anyone else struggle or have hardships if I can help in some way\". but if helping her Tanks your life you have done just that to yourself (losing your house and working yourself to death is the epitome of \"struggle & hardship\") and for what.

That would be a nice compromise\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m sorry I know literally NO ONE agrees with me but I have 3 sisters, and I would NEVER let one of them go homeless. At the least help her get to a shelter - sure she\u2019s a financial burden but she\u2019s a fucking human being have some compassion my god. Do you know how likely it is she will be raped if she does go homeless?

No I don\u2019t think he shouldn\u2019t kick her out - hence my first sentence - yes I do think this makes them an asshole.

She chose to get pregnant.  She chose to demand for you to pay her to use 2/3 of your house.  She chose to make you choose between supporting her and losing your house.  She chose all of this.\n\nps2: if you got a mortgage feb '22, you probably have an approx 4.2% mortgage rate on a 30 year fixed.  As of today, it's 7.25%.

While it is of course shitty to OP because she\u2019s already been far more generous than needed, this might be the least stressful & emotionally draining option. Inform your sister that you will either go through the legal eviction proceedings which can take months, depending on your area and how far along she is she might give birth during this time! Moving with a newborn is going to be that much more difficult and stressful. Frame it as the best option for her as well. Instead OP is willing to offer $xxx to help her get on her feet elsewhere, and settle in before the baby arrives.

I truly understand how hard it would be to see someone you love facing an immense amount of hardship and NOT help. It\u2019s understandable that you want to do all you can for your sister and her baby. \n\nWhat you need to bear in mind are two things: \n\nFirst:  To sweep in like your sister\u2019s rescuer will not do her any favors in the long run, and you have to think long term here. The time for her to start looking very seriously at her own future is now, but by taking care of everything for her, you\u2019re actually going to be a roadblock. The best thing you can do for her is sit her down and be very honest with her that the home and money she\u2019s counting on from you is about to go away if things don\u2019t change. She\u2019s going to be a mother, and she is going to be responsible for her own baby physically, emotionally, and financially. She needs to understand what that really means, and she needs to make a plan now to prepare. Every day you continue to let her think her plan is YOU, is another day she could be job hunting, saving, budgeting, apartment hunting (if she\u2019s determined that the baby needs its own nursery), etc, and she\u2019s going to need every bit of her time before the baby comes to get ready. \n\nSecond:  If you decide to dedicate all your time and resources to helping your sister, you will eventually run out of time, resources, and energy. What will happen then? Your sister won\u2019t have made a plan in advance. She probably won\u2019t be well-equipped to suddenly parent alone. She will probably blame her struggles on you. And you will have seriously damaged your own financial security and future in the process. \n\nSo I think you really need to reframe in your mind what helping your sister can and should look like. \n\nYou can help her by supporting her job search. By telling her that you need X amount in rent monthly for the ONE room she is entitled to in your home, and making it clear that not paying will mean eviction, but that paying regularly will ensure she still has a roof over her head. Put a rental agreement in writing for your protection and for hers. Help her find and sign up for childbirth/parenting classes. Help her figure out how to access medical care, community programs, benefits, and child support from the baby\u2019s father. She will be doing a disservice to her child if she fails to go after that. If you feel willing, offer to babysit now and then, but make sure your sister knows you cannot be her full time childcare solution. You have your own life to protect, and you can\u2019t sacrifice your own career and future for her choices. Because these are her choices, and she needs to grow up and face them. \n\nBut please do not put your life on hold for the sake of hers. Do not burn down your own success just to build up someone who still hasn\u2019t learned how to stand on her own. Move forward to help in a way that will not lead to resentment and regret, and you will be both protecting yourself and gently leading your sister towards the actual independence you want for her.\n\nEdit: I feel like what you\u2019re maybe really looking for here is permission to put yourself first.

Are you sure this baby wasn't planned? NTA", "If she stays, you should have total control of her finances", "NTA.\nI think you already did enough to help her. She put herself in this situation and you shouldn\u2018t have to sacrifice your dreams for this. Maybe you can support her in a smaller way, but it needs to be very clear that the main responsibility for her and her baby is on her. I don\u2018t think she realises this at all as she is unhappy she can\u2018t have an extra room in OP\u2018s house as a nursery on top of living there for free. This screams entitlement to me.", "NTA. Just because she's at rock bottom and brought a shovel doesn't mean you have to let her take you down too.", "NTA your sister made some really shitty decisions banking on you to bail her out. She should look into social services and resources for low income pregnant women in your area. She'd probably qualify for stuff like food stamps, free or reduced cost healthcare, employment resources, low income housing, etc. You shouldn't give up your dream home because of her poor life choices.\n\n\n\n\nAs a side note, does anyone else find it completely bullshit that substitute teachers are only paid $14 an hour? All teachers deserve not only a living wage but a thriving wage.", "You need to give her a time frame for leaving and get an eviction notice for it too. Immediately find a roommate for the third room and look around for one for your sisters room for around the date of her moving.\n\nLiving with roommates sucks ass, but 2 roommates for a small period of time can help you stay afloat and give you back your savings + pay of debt from the roof. Even if it is just a year or so.\n\nIf you find 1 good roommate you can eventually keep them and clear out the third bedroom for a privacy space for yourself.\n\nI think that if you've gotten into the housing market you need to fight to stay there. The money from the sale will be eaten up by your sister if you go that route and you will have nothing to show for your hard work.\n\nAlternatively, you can get a roommate for the third room and not kick out your sister. It will give you an immediate cash flow that you can probably use.\n\nBut you need to address your sisters entitlement to your space and resources now, before you let it control your whole life and take you away from the good path you're on.", "NTA, it sounds like you have done alot for your sister and she has taken zero opportunities to actually benefit herself in the future. I completely understand how obligated you can feel to younger siblings. I'm the eldest of 5 and have 2 of my siblings living with me. But I have expectations and boundaries. Since you have been so lenient with your sister it sounds like she is just taking advantage of your kindness. And now that she is pregnant she is really trying to milk it. Asking for another room for example, when she isn't even paying for the one she's in. She expects she can just overrun your home and you will do nothing because she can literally do anything with no consequence. Some times in order to really love someone, you have to let them figure it out themselves. The will never grow up if you do everything for them. Also, why are you trying so hard to make things easier on her, when she goes out of her way to make them harder on you. \n\nI'd call mom and dad and let them know you are not doing it anymore and that they need to take her or she's gonna have to figure something else out.\nBe strong op.

For the love of god dont do it. After watching this play out, If you are serious keeping her at the house, you should seriously look into custody now. Cause that's what's in your future. \n\nShes made one bad decision after another and once that child enters the world whatever poor decision your sister makes it going to have 10x worse consequences and it can have devastating effects on the child. \n\nIf you dont get a backbone now, this are going to spiral right out of your control. You have one shot right now to get your life on track......and its RIGHT NOW. \n\nAlso consider this, if you go under, if you loose that house you will not be able to help in the future.
