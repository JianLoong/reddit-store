You could have also told him that many females need to make up stories about a husband, so idiot males don't try certain things ... but he would have had a problem with that, too. The flight attendants should have taken control of the situation when he was talking over you and stopped him or seen his behavior and had him move.", "NTA. This man sounds creepy as hell. Know your boundaries and protect yourself", "Huge NTA. I guarantee this dude thought he was entitled to your company and conversation through the entire flight as well. I'm so sick of having to be polite to entitled men just so they won't fly off the handle.", "I travel solo and rode a commuter bus for 10 years. The best slap to people like this is to let them sit down and then move. The message is loud and clear with no words spoken.", "NTA. There were plenty of empty seats, and he was clearly trying to creep on you.", "NTA. He was clearly trying to be a creep and took active pleasure in making you lose your cool. I'm a little unsure as to whether or not you should file a complaint against the flight attendants though. On the one hand you both were yelling and making a scene, so I can understand the flight attendants wanting to resolve that first and foremost. On the other they essentially put the majority of the blame on you and nearly punished you for standing your ground against a creep...", "NTA, he sounds like an absolute nightmare who couldn't even hide it until the plane was in the air. There are some people who love flying because they literally have a captive audience in their seatmate and actively seek out people they think won't just flat out tell them to shut up once they start BSing. He was clearly looking forward to being creepy at a woman who can't get away from him, and when you switched the seats up he decided to just go fully antagonistic. I'm sorry you had to deal with him. Unsettling at the best of times, terrifying in small, confined, spaces \n\nRe: the flight attendant, my guess is she asked you to move because this guy was clearly difficult and would be a problem if asked to move, and since there were plenty of open rows she knew she could move you somewhere where you wouldn't have to deal with anyone.", "NTA but don't go into a fight just move next time. There are creepy guys everywhere don't waste your energy on them.", "NTA he sounds creepy AF and probably wouldn't have taken no for an answer regardless of what you said. Even though the husband thing was a lie why would he STILL sit there after you said that when half the plane was empty? Arguing with him instead of moving was kind of a gamble though. People are deranged and you have to ask yourself if you can out-derange them and deal with the repercussions.", "NTA that guy was weirdly aggressive. Also the flight attendant should have made you both take turns telling your version of events and who ever continued to talk over the other was clearly the problem. I\u2019m guessing it would have been him.", "NTA at all. He was being rude, entitled, and very creepy. You did what you needed to do to get him away from you.

I HATE it when there are obviously open seats on transport and people HAVE to sit next to you.

Flight attendants are supposed to move the person making the complaint, no matter who is right or wrong. so they are NTA either.", "NTA but you absolutely needed to move. In an ideal world you shouldn't have to and men wouldn't behave like this, but they do, so we have to move. \n\nA decent bloke, on realising that a woman had lied about a man accompanying her to stop him sitting next to her, would be embarrassed and would move. Decent men know to not invade women's space.\n\nThe fact he challenged you about having lied to him shows  what kind of man he is, and he is not a safe one. The fact he even tried to sit in a seat right next to a lone woman when specifically told to spread out shows his intentions. \n\nI think the flight attendant stopped you being assaulted.", "This is the reason I wear over the ear noise canceling headphones on the plan and put them on immediately. It's how I got out of a conversation with a missionary from my old religion asking me why I left it behind.", "NTA! People who are calling you TA are clearly not reading your post correctly. The flight was half empty, if I was in your shoes I would want a row to myself as well. \n\nAlso I understand why you did the husband thing, the guy was being a creep and by telling you I want to sit next to you, he was highlighting his intentions which were weird as fuck. Why as a grown arse man would you go out of your way to sit next to a young female who you don\u2019t know? especially in this day and age. He should know better that he would be precieved as a threat and you we\u2019re right to move.", "NTA. He sounds crazy and aggressive, but you were trying to take up three seats.

Sitting in a middle seat to hog an entire row is asshole behavior. The creepy guy was an asshole too.", "YTA. Half full still means half the rows will have two people in it.

And uh, I get not telling people you're traveling alone, but when you're about to be in an enclosed tube for X amount of time, it may become obvious that you're not traveling with someone?
