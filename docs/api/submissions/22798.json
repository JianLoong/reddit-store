Their entire house is covered in a thin layer of hair. If you sit anywhere in the house, it\u2019s guaranteed you\u2019ll have animal hair joyriding on your clothes. It\u2019s so bad that their food will have animal hair in it. These people will pick the animal hair out of their mouths and keep on chewing like it\u2019s the most normal thing in the world. I\u2019ve seen their cats use the litter box then jump on the counter while her mom is cooking. Sometimes her mom pretends she\u2019s on a cooking show and narrates to the cats while the cats are pawing at the ingredients. Also, when I walk into the house I\u2019m immediately hit with pungent animal odors. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s from the litter boxes or the bird and rat cages but I\u2019ve gagged every time I\u2019ve ever entered in their house. Outside of these issues, they are great people.\n\nSo her parents had a dinner party and were cooking lots of food because they were expecting about 50 people. I knew from past experiences that I can\u2019t eat there so I told my GF I will meet her there instead of driving together because I had some stuff to do at work. I stopped at a restaurant after work and before the party. When I got there, her mom tried to make me a plate but I told her that I was on a diet and trying to lose weight. My GF overhead and glared silently at me. Her mom tried to get me to eat and I kept on saying how great her food smells but I could see hair in it the entire time.\n\nWhen we got back to our place, my GF tore into me as soon as she walked through the door. She said I was being disrespectful to her family by not eating their food and lying about being on a diet. That exploded into her asking what else am I lying about. She wants me to admit to her parents what I did and apologize but I don\u2019t think I should as I did lie but it was to save their feelings.\n\nIt\u2019s been a week and she\u2019s still mad at me and told me she\u2019ll remain mad until I apologize. She\u2019s angry sleeping on her side with her back to me right now. I never knew there was such a thing as angry sleeping but I swear her snores are more aggressive than usual.", "created_utc": 1689936889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155klkx/aita_for_lying_to_my_gfs_parents_about_being_on_a/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did you tell your gf you lied because you don't want to eat contaminated food and pick fur out of your mouth/food? Is she really telling you to admit that to her parents? Does she thing that's going to go over well?\n\nMaybe she went straight to yelling and being upset because she knows you're not on a diet without letting you give an explanation. If so, please tell her OP. She may get mad, but she should already have issues eating there herself. She's clearly fine with it so I'd think twice about what else she accepts as ok.

Also it's not like you get to decide what disgust you or not (i know that if i ate there i would make myself sick just by overthinking about the animals hairs in the food and everything)\nMaybe, if your GF is reasonable, you could explain your issue and find a solution together? Maybe explaining to the parents that you don't have the same level of comfort as they do or something?

I always say I'm too anxious to eat other people's cooking because of cross contamination and bring me own :P", "NTA. You have good reason to avoid the food (cats jumping on the kitchen counter after using the litterbox... they're BEGGING for toxoplasmosis) and you did the right thing by using an excuse that wouldn't be taken as a direct insult. If you think your girlfriend would be receptive to it when she cools down, tell her the real reason why you didn't want to eat there and hopefully she would appreciate your effort to not hurt their feelings. Good luck OP!", "NTA.  You went to the home although it makes you gag.  You attempted to find a non hurtful way to avoid eating their food.  You have a right to your own beliefs and actions.  However, roughly 49 other guests apparently managed to eat the food.  Leaves me wondering if your extra or abnormally finicky and exaggerating.  Pet lovers like this either do their best to keep it clean or they dont see it as a problem they can change.  As a pet person, this is ingrained and not changing.  Your GF is going to want similar lifestyle/pets in her future.  Since it angered her I believe this will be an ongoing source of friction.  Something you'll need to sort out and or move on with someone who doesn't want or need animals in their life.  I want to add although I understand your point of view, it was kind of rude...unintentionally.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can't stand in her house because I feel contaminated, let alone eat her food. NTA and I'm a little surprised your gf is mad. You were polite and spared their feelings, but I wouldn't expect or want my SO to knowingly eat food that contains dirty pet hairs or that was prepared on nasty surfaces.", "They are dirty.", "NTA- I wonder how many people from the party got sick after? I like pets but that house sounds disgusting. I don\u2019t understand why she got mad at you  except to her it\u2019s normal, that\u2019s what she grew up with and it\u2019s something you really don\u2019t have to tolerate.", "I'd ask her \"which would you prefer, that I do a small white lie to gracefully maintain our relationship with your folks, or tell them bluntly that I don't want to eat their food because it consistently is filled with unhygienic pet fur to the extent we often have to pull it out of our teeth and/or risk toxoplasmosis?\" Because those are her two options.\n\nNTA, I have fluffs but they do not get to be on counters in the kitchen and you must constantly, vigilantly work against the everpresent tide of pet dander to keep your home livable for any guests. Like multiple times a day cleaning and sweeping. Anything less and your home becomes a nightmare for anyone with even the most minor allergy.", "Dude, run! Do you want this behavior from her for the rest of your life? Because her parents house will always be filthy and unsafe. You won't be able to take children there. She will always act like this. This is your wake up call. It's time to go.", "NTA. My neighbor is exactly the same, and I'm running out of excuses for not eating her food! \n\nI was horrified the first time I stepped foot into their house and saw the filth and cats climbing all over the food. Makes me sick to think about it.", "NTA she expects you to eat dog hair covered food? I feel sick just thinking about it", "NTA. Telling them their house is dirty and their house is full of animal hair would\u2019ve been rude but you should tell your girlfriend. You really should\u2019ve told her this a long time ago.", "NTA that's disgusting", "I was eating breakfast while reading this. Bad idea!  Completely lost my appetite.  NTA!!", "NTA\nTell your gf that you don\u2019t ever intend to eat in her parents house because of the smell and the pet hair in the food and you were trying to spare their feelings but since she insists and you\u2019d like the relationship to continue you will tell them the truth. \n\nIt might even be for the best because are you going to be on a diet for the rest of your relationship?\n\nBut to be clear, your little white lie was not offensive. As long as her parents don\u2019t know you\u2019re not on a diet, saying you were was more polite than saying \u201cthe hair in the food and the odor in your house makes me never want to eat here\u201d.

I don't understand why people feel it's a show of disrespect to say no, but it's perfectly OK to ignore your preferences.\n\nYou shouldn't have to lie, though. Surely her parents realize that cat hair is not a seasoning. I have 3 cats who aren't allowed on my counters, but since everyone knows how well cats follow rules, I never put food directly on the counter, and I wipe all surfaces before I put down any cutting boards of plates. I don't want to have to comb my food before I eat.", "NTA tell your GF and tell the parents that one time some dog hair got in your intestine and reacted negatively and the doctor told you not to eat food laced with animal hairs", "NTA.\n\nINFO: Did you actually tell her the real reason you couldn't eat their food? Frankly most people will return food they are eating when they go out to restaurants if even a single hair is found in it.\n\nEvery now and then I find a piece of my cats' hair in the food we make. It happens now and then. But if it's as bad as you say then they are just being extremely unhygienic. \n\nIf she does know and is saying you have to tell them... pretty sure you should just end the relationship there.", "It may well be a dealbreaker if he tells her the real reason.
