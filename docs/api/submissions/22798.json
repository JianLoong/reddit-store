Pet lovers like this either do their best to keep it clean or they dont see it as a problem they can change.  As a pet person, this is ingrained and not changing.  Your GF is going to want similar lifestyle/pets in her future.  Since it angered her I believe this will be an ongoing source of friction.

After the 3rd time, my husband suspected something was up and I told him that the pizza makes me sick and I don't want to ruin the mood when we visit.

Allowing pets to walk over everything with dirty paws. Letting the animals touch the food. Most of the house smelt disgusting no matter how much I cleaned it because my mom was a hoarder that had the tendency to hoard random crap *and* animals. I once seen one of the cats lick its butthole then immediately drink out of a pot of water my mom was cooking dinner in. When I pointed it out she told me \"A little bit of germs never hurt anyone, this is why you're immune system is so weak. You're such a clean freak that you don't allow your body to adjust to germs!\" For reference, I would get pneumonia at least 4 times a year and was sick at least once a month before moving out. I've been moved out for years and have only seen really sick twice and outside of maybe 2 or 3 colds have been perfectly healthy so no it was the fact the house was so disgusting it was making me sick. I won't even go to my siblings' house because they're the exact same way. I avoided visiting my parents because just being there made me feel disgusting and it hurt to breath.

Sounds super dramatic, but I promise it wasn't if you knew the full extent of it. \n\nAny sane person doesn't want pet fur in their food and certainly doesn't want a pet touching it with their nasty paws/body.

Either too many, or not cleaning often enough. \n\nYeah, angry sleeping is a thing. I've done it before.

Your description of her parent's house and kitchen made \"You can't eat at everybody's house\" TikTok start playing in the back of my head. Does your girlfriend realize that you're specifically on a \"no pet hair and litter crumbs in your food\" diet, does she just think you don't like her mother's cooking in general? IF you were to apologize to her mother for lying, does she also expect you to confront her mother about mom's home/kitchen hygiene standards?
