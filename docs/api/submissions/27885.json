{"id": 27885, "submission_id": "16viawz", "title": "AITA for making my ex-husband give our son his car keys back?", "selftext": "My ex-husband & I have a 17 year old son who began driving and got his own car a little over a year ago. He has had a good clean record so far, no accidents.\n\nEarly this week, however, he had a minor road rage incident (which I am describing as I saw on my son\u2019s dashcam footage). He was in a left turn lane at a red light behind two other cars. The light turned green, but the car in front didn\u2019t move. The car in front of my son, and my son, leaned on their horn but they still didn\u2019t move. They blared their horns non stop for a good 15 seconds, but the car still didn\u2019t move.\n\nThe light turned red, and just afterwards the car in front ran the red light and made a u-turn. My son, as the car passed him in the opposite lane, flipped off the driver and screamed \u201cSTUPID F***ING B****!\u201d at the top of his lungs out the window at the driver, a woman who looked to be in her 60s or 70s. That intersection has LONG lights, so my son had to wait a long time for the next green light.\n\nCoincidentally, this woman lives in the same condo complex as my ex-husband and son, even though neither of them claim to have ever met her before or recognized her. But she  apparently recognized my son and his car. She confronted my ex-husband about it a couple days afterward. She made my son\u2019s behavior sound a LOT worse than it actually was (she said my son \u201cthreatened\u201d and \u201cintimidated\u201d her) and also downplayed her actions (she said she made a \u201ctiny driving mistake\u201d and didn\u2019t give any more details beyond that).\n\nMy ex took a look at my son\u2019s dashcam footage and saw the whole incident. Though he agreed it wasn\u2019t as bad as she made it sound, he was still angry at my son. He made him apologize, and told him he would be taking away his keys for a whole week, meaning he\u2019d have to walk to school and everywhere else. He made a big deal of how he doesn\u2019t want his son \u201cdisrespecting women and his elders\u201d or road raging.\n\nI thought his punishment was WAY too harsh considering the circumstances. I had a long conversation with my ex the day after he made the punishment, made clear how I felt, and demanded he give him his keys back. He stood his ground at first but eventually (and very reluctantly) gave in, since I\u2019m the parent he spends the most time with and thus the one who has ultimate veto power.\n\nMy ex seemed really unhappy about our son getting out of his punishment.

I don't care how considerate anyone thinks they are; EVERYONE gets road rage at one point in time. His actions were normal.  Yes, he should be talked to and since she lives near, yes an apology....but honestly it's not that big of a deal.\n\nAnyone who denies this is lying. No one is Ned Flanders all the time while driving", "So, deal with your son by being honest- so, yeah, son, she was exactly what you said she was but now you need to understand where you went wrong, and learn from it.\n\nThen I\u2019d go and tell the lady that son was right and the entire interaction is on camera and you\u2019d be happy to show everyone what a rude, inconsiderate and law breaking driver she is.", "Nta. Like he gave a fuck what sex the driver was or their age. Everyone let's a little finger out and frustration occasionally... not like HE ran the red light or went up to her car. I call guys bitches too for not paying attention to driving.. lady was clearly hanging out on her phone or took a little nappy.. maybe she shouldn't be driving for a week. Lol", "NTA. I think you're not wrong OP. Rage/anger are natural feelings and instead of punishing those feelings, we want to help our kids understand why acting that way is problematic, and help them find safer, healthier ways of working thru anger.\n\nPunishing him by taking a car he bought (if I read your post right, I'm not feeling great at the moment) will only cause that anger to fester.\n\nYour son acted inappropriately, so it's fair to have a frank discussion with him.", "Yta he's going to scream at the wrong person and 1- get the shit beat out of him or 2- get the shit beat out of the car.\n\nOne week of no car for having a car related temper tantrum is fine.", "Walking around for a week for acting like an asshole while in a vehicle that can kill people is not an excessive punishment.", "I am going with YTA. \n\nThe old lady isn't important here... yeah, she was jerk and a liar, who cares, you aren't her parent.\n\nRather this is about your sons behavior. You have very little time to teach him about the consequences of his actions and it is clear you haven't done a good enough job yet if he is flying off the handle and screaming obscenities at people because he had a wait a few minutes... and that is what we are talking about here... waiting one more turn cycle even at a long light. That was the entirety of his inconvenience.\n\nYour X's plan was to take his car privileges for a week so he realizes this was serious. Yours was to teach your son that he can do what he wants and mommy will make sure he doesn't face consequences. That is a pretty bad lesson.\n\nNow, maybe there is more context here where walking to school is a huge hardship or something, but assuming it is less than an hour walk each way... yeah, I don't see the issue.\n\nSucks your X caved when being a good parent.", "YTA.  Great way to teach your son responsibility and maturity by not only overlooking but also totally minimizing his actions. I bet your reply to his bad behavior is always, \"it's not as bad as it seems.\"", "YTA \n\n\u201cUltimate veto power\u201d just because he stays with you most?\n\nSo you are communicating to your son that his dad\u2019s parenting methods DO NOT MATTER. \nNice going.\nCo parenting not one parenting.", "YTA. Being angry is one thing, but road rage could get him killed. He needs to learn to control his temper.", "\u201cCoincidentally\u201d\u2026.. lmao\n\nI should of used these bots to right my high school essays", "Yes, YTA\n\nYour son needs to learn to control himself while driving, the punishment was extremely reasonable. \n\nAlso, you damaged your son's relationship with his father and undermined his authority. How would you like it if your ex second guessed your parenting?", "YTA. He is a new driver. Road rage is unacceptable, because you NEVER know how the other person will respond. A woman in texas was shot and killed during a road rage incident recently.", "YTA  your son was wrong, no matter what. Will you cancel punishment when he hits his girlfriend? \n  On the dash cam video he was abusive and you're enabling it.", "YTA. This is where it starts, and this is where you need to nip this shitty behavior in the bud. You are choosing to teach your son there are no repercussions for screaming at other people. We need less people like that in the world, not more.", "YTA. A week of no car for that obnoxious and intimidating tantrum your son threw at a senior citizen was not long enough, imho. You are enabling your son\u2019s anger issues and not doing him any favors in learning how to act like a responsible adult.", "I'm gonna go ESH - he may spend more time with you, but you're still co-parenting and I would think still want to put up a united front. Now, you're risking a precedent where if he doesn't like what dad says, maybe mom will give me what I want.", "YTA I generally hate one parent imposing a harsh punishment. But this isn't it. It would be a while before my son got keys back if he ever behaved that way. The honking for 15 seconds would have been enough,  btw.", "YTA. You've basically made it ok for him to use aggresive, sexist language. His father was teaching him. You have enabled him.", "The driver who sat through the redlight was either distracted by something (texting, lost in thought, etc) and then decided to be an ass herself when the other drivers blew their horns - OR she is losing her ability to drive safely - and when she relayed the issue to your husband, she exaggerated your son's role and downplayed her own. That should be acknowledged. \n\nAll that said - your son definitely needed some consequences for his behavior. In many places, what he did would be cause for a ticket at the least, or even an arrest. Taking his keys for a week and possibly apologizing to the woman for the extremety of his response is definitely appropriate. Personally, I'd make him look up the definition of road rage in your state to see for himself what consequences he could have been facing had a cop inclined to intervene against him had witnessed the incident.  YTA", "YTA. Your son needs to learn to control his anger because one day he will rage at the wrong person and end up hurt or dead. He absolutely should lose his car for a week and if you ask me that\u2019s getting off light. People these days are crazy who\u2019s to say the old lady didn\u2019t know if your son was gonna hurt her. That whole incident could have gone over way worse and your son is lucky to have a dashcam and a father who actually cares about his child\u2019s concerning behavior.", "YTA - In my opinion I think the punishment was reasonable. Or at the very least some sort of punishment is reasonable. By reversing the decision you are essentially teaching your son that road rage is sometimes justified. It's not. Maybe this time it's a curse word...but next time it could be an aggressive move or he could piss off the wrong person. Surely you have some sort of co-parenting agreement or understanding with your ex about how to determine discipline, so presumably your ex should have consulted you about it, but at the same time you blatantly ignored that as well by vetoing him completely and not giving out any punishment.", "YTA. \n\nYour son swore and used a misogynistic slur aimed at an older woman. Not cool. Although it\u2019s not why I\u2019m saying YTA. The punishment wasn\u2019t THAT bad. A week is a pretty short time. You could have stood by your ex and presented a united front in stating his behavior was unacceptable. Instead you let your son know you don\u2019t respect his father\u2019s views, and that you don\u2019t see what he did as wrong.", "YTA.\n\nYour son needs to learn that the appropriate time to pick a fight is not when the other party is in a thousand pound death machine. Its wild that you thinking screaming obscenities at someone from your car *isn't* threatening and intimidating; what would be the purpose of him doing it if it wasn't?\n\nOne of these days he's going to pick a fight with the wrong person and get seriously injured or killed. If he can't manage his emotions while he's driving, then he's a danger on the road and not mature enough to be behind the wheel.\n\nYour ex was right to take the car keys. You're making excuses for your son's behavior.", "YTA. At this age to have a temper like that and sounds like you don't want nip in the bud. Because it will only get worse unless you stop it no, thru therapy or parent on way. Because layer instead of a bumper sticker saying my son is an honor roll student. It will say my son makes license plates.", "YTA. A weeks not gonna kill a 17 year old. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves, you did this cause you wanted to be the nice parent and one up your ex-husband. \nCoparenting is a team job, it\u2019s not popularity contest.", "Nta. This woman has some issues if she's tracking down your kid multiple days after the event. \n\nYour kid went too far, but the punishment here doesn't fit the crime.", "Ewe- YTA. Terrible enablement. You want your punk son to get shot next time by some crazy person he is road raging at? Dad was \ud83d\udcaf right.", "You are enabling your son\u2019s sexist, disrespectful treatment of women. YTA", "ESH \n\nThe old lady for exaggerate on how and what happend \n\nYour son for raging like that to a mistake someone made \n\nYour Ex bc the punishment was a little to much, getting a lecture and having to apologize would have been enough at that age \n\nYou for the \"ulitimate vetopower\" because your son spends more time at your house... no thats not how co-parenting works", "I guess your ex never gets mad in traffic and he is perfect driver.", "NTA. If anyone should have their keys taken for a week it\u2019s that other driver. Especially after she lied about what she did.", "Yta if you don\u2019t correct his behavior right now, he will be worse. Road rage is the most dangerous thing to ever deal with my family had to deal with multiple driver following us on the road due to road rage.", "NTA\n\nLike sure, what your son did is not ok, but unless it becomes a pattern I wouldn't worry about it. And taking away his keys for a week is definitely way over the top. It's much better to just talk to them to try and understand why they behaved that way and why it's bad to do so.", "NTA You need to have some form of punishment but a week seems out of line. Shouting at someone who sits at a green light for an entire cycle isn't that crazy. But he needs to  realize  that a) she could have had a seizure b) she  could have been armed & crazy c) she's someone's mother/grandmother and life is too short to get so angry.", "ESH.  Your husband should have discussed punishment with you.  There is also the question of who paid for the car?  Your son\u2019s behavior was horrendous.  That said, where was the elderly drivers apology for not paying attention to the changing light?", "YTA - it doesn't matter if she was telling the truth or not, you need to be focused on your son's behavior.  Your son has an anger issue.  People have gotten killed because they flipped off another driver.  Laying on a horn for 15 seconds is a good way to enrage the other driver.  None of your son's behavior was appropriate.  Clearly something was going on with the other driver and instead of letting it go and getting on with it, he SCREAMED \u201cSTUPID FING B\\*!\u201d at the top of his lungs out the window.  I would say that is threatening and intimidating - otherwise why would he have done it?  \n\nYour entire post reads such that your little boy can do no wrong and everything was her fault.  Newsflash - your son behaved abhorrently and I bet he does worse.  Your poor baby has to walk to school for a week?  He needs to learn to control his anger and respond appropriately in situations, especially while driving.  That is what you should be focused on, not how the women wronged your perfect son.\n\nYou need to review his dashcam footage constantly and take away the car if he isn't behaving appropriately.", "Who owns the car?  And yes, you're YTA.", "NTA. While maybe a little excessive, your husband is more worried about being embarrassed than justice.    \nWho bought the car? Because if the son bought it, your ex is way out of line.", "Old ppl shouldnt be on the road", "would the kid\u2019s words be accurate if, ahem, her hands weren\u2019t on the wheel during that honking?", "The punishment does not fit the crime. Your son got mad at someone who should not be on the road. You talked to him about his behavior, that was all that needed to be done.\nNTA", "NTA\n\nDad made a tiny parenting mistake. I've learned the hard way that getting mad at your kids is never the correct answer. A firm discussion about appropriate interaction on the road and the kid saying he'd work to do better really should have been the end of it from that end.\n\nLady is frankly lucky all she got was yelled at. Lots of times, more things would happen in 2023.", "NTA. \n\nBoth parents should either agree to a punishment or realize a punishment will only work at their own home. \n\nMaybe it is because I am from California, but shouting at someone who could have caused an accident isn't really that big of a deal. I think a lesson about safety is in order (what if the person had a gun, what if they had followed your son home, etc) but you don't not swear at someone because they are a woman or older- they are bad drivers too. \n\nI don't know exactly the best way to resolve it when two divorced parents disagree on a punishment, and I don't think there is a great way to always handle it. But given that the woman was in the wrong and exaggerated her claim, to punish your son to that extent I think sends a wrong message, whereas there was probably a better middle ground. The worst part to me is that he made your son apologize to someone who bold face lied and drove unsafely, then said some BS about respecting women and elders, as if it would have been okay if it was a middle aged man.", "Nta- she was petty.

The woman should not be on the road if she cannot operate her vehicle decently and while your son was a little rude, the reaction was not excessive. Age and sex are irrelevant.", "This really depends on who owns the car. If it\u2019s owned by you, he has no right to take the keys at all, so not the ah. And ditto for you, if he owns it then you have no say in whether or not your son can use it, so you are the ah. If your son owns the car, neither of you get a say or can take his keys (with the exception of extreme misbehavior pertaining strictly to driving - which I personally don\u2019t think road rage to this degree counts) & need to find other ways to punish him, in this case you are also not the ah since ex would have no right to take the keys in the first place. \n\nSo I lean towards NTA, unless his father actually owns the car.", "Nta.

I read an article a couple months ago about a husband and wife driving in Texas, for years the wife had warned the husband about his road rage. Well he decided to flip someone off for something they did, and in return these people shot up their vehicle. The husband survived, but his wife did not. \n\nHe specifically states in his interview how his wife had consistently warned him about this very thing, how he wishes he had listened to her before it was too late.

I get being upset in this situation but the level of upset was too much- for what? for him having to wait a long time for a green light?\n\nwas he on the way to perform emergency surgery? no? all right, than there was no reason for him to have this kind of reaction.\n\ni'm not sure that he needed to apologize to anyone but i admit i'm concerned at both son's reaction and OP's response.", "Yeah, I'm sure the woman over exaggerated and was texting or something stupid but that is no way to act. One week is hardly a harsh punishment.", "Where do you live where yelling at someone and giving them the finger is cause for a ticket and/or arrest?? If that's all it takes, then every driver in NYC would be sitting in jail \n\n If ANYONE in this story would be arrested, it would be the old lady who ran a red light and made an illegal u turn.", "As a woman in that age bracket, we are NOT elderly. Road rage is problematic and 17 year olds often make bad decisions. There are also plenty of idiots who carry guns, so just handing the keys back will not help her son think deeply about his actions in response to her mistake. A discussion about acting from a place of kindness and grace when faced with frustrating behavior because he has no idea what the other driver might be going through should be had. Restrictions on what driving he can do, ( it's fine to drive to work and school as those are his responsibilities, but no driving to dates and parties or hang outs with friends) is a better compromise than, here's your keys back because momma said so.", "Agreed. A young male yelling is definitely intimidating to an older woman. I don't get how OP doesn't see that. A week punishment is not too much. How can anyone think that is a severe punishment?", "What if woman was having car trouble and was turning around to go home? Yep kid needs to learn proper road manners.", "She lives in the same condo complex, she didn't hire a private investigator", "Sexism? Really?  How incredibly detached are you? It was only \"sexism \" cause that driver happened to be a woman; the kid probably would've had the EXACT same reaction if that driver had been a man. You're reaching", "It wasn't too much at all. Acting like an asshole, likely driving dangerously while flipping her off, when behind the wheel of a vehicle that can kill people deserves a punishment that's much more than a tap on the wrist and a forced apology.", "Just because you get mad, you shouldn't be swearing and yelling at people. It's a few seconds of waiting. The kid will live.", "It's one week. Come on. The kid will live.", "That's fair. Why didn't she go until the light was red? Was she on her phone and driving while distracted? Then she ran a red light which is illegal, could have caused a car crash, and she also made a illegal u turn which again... illegal.\n\nHow do you not notice the light turn green and TWO cars honking at you for (however) long periods. This lady shouldn't be driving period. It's not even about age, it's about all her dangerous actions pointing at being a danger to herself and others, he should not be punished for that.\n\nHowever I agree OP should at least talk to him about how karma will catch up to people like her and he can send in his dashcam footage to the police to report an unsafe driver rather than \"road rage\" and cause more issues, especially if they live in the US.", "And that\u2019s why I said she should talk to her son\u2026.?", "Was in Texas unless there was another one in California (totally possible). \n\nhttps://www.wfaa.com/article/news/crime/hurst-texas-road-rage-shooting-incident-east-loop-820/287-c21b7795-a9b1-4d9b-b770-c3f1c9d1574e\n\n\u201cShe was an innocent victim. She was a passenger in the car when I flipped off a driver who put us in danger. She always hated when I did that, and I did it anyways. Then the driver shot into our car and struck my beautiful wife, who had nothing to do with anything.\u201d", "I\u2019m trying to figure out wtf you could be doing in your car, especially an old person, that you miss an entire light. Not catching the first few seconds of a light is one thing but you missed and entire light AND he beeped. That\u2019s no minor mistake. I\u2019d be mad too BUT he did handle it wrong.  He shouldn\u2019t be telling a t strangers that\u2019s why he needs to be talked to.", "She also ran the red light after having missed the green light. Making a u-turn no less. That's not a tiny mistake, but a potentially deadly one.", "Don't be ignorant", "Me neither. I'm 42 years old, and while I have mentally berated other drivers in my head, I have NEVER EVER treated another road user in the disgusting manner that OPs son has. A 16 year old yelling abuse, name calling, and sticking his finger up at an elderly woman is intimidating. If it was my son, he'd be walking to school every day, and when he came home, his back would be aching from all the yard work he'd have to do for the next month.", "Clearly you've never driven in Texas.... And it's perfectly normal to get pissy at bad drivers. If the woman was sitting there THRU honking, SHE was the one not paying attention... don't be ignorant", "Therapy is a gross exaggeration of what is needed if someone wishes to yell at bad driver and flip her the bird.  One reason I love moonroofs, makes the bird easier.", "You\u2019re kidding, right? Most people have shouted things at shitty drivers. \ud83e\udd23", "Sure", "She should have pulled into somewheres parking lot and called for help instead of running a red light and pulling an illegal u turn, all of which could have caused an accident.", "Lmfao sitting still at a green light is not worse wtf are you on about.", "I agree here, it's frustrating, very frustrating, but you have to learn to harness yourself and behave civilly in a society.  A week isn't very long, don't undermine your son's father by dismissing the discipline.", "I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to offend. I can change it to \u201colder\u201d if that would be better. Really I was thinking more on the son\u2019s perception. 17 year olds do stupid things. I know I did. He needs to understand that he has to control his temper and just giving him back his keys won\u2019t do that. Your compromise is also fair, but I\u2019d probably still stick with the ex so as to present a united front. The week long no car is in the long run a minor inconvenience.", "She held onto what isn't an uncommon but admittedly annoying event for multiple days and then straight up lied about it for snitching on a child to his parents. \n\nI wish there was a singular word to describe people who acted this way.", "He called the woman a \u201cbitch.\u201d That is sexist. If you call woman that word, you are also sexist. Do better.", ">  likely driving dangerously while flipping her off,\n\nUh, what? He was still stuck at the red light when she drove past him.", "I agree that the lady is wrong too. But the son isn't being punished for her actions. He's (correctly) being punished for losing his temper.", "They're agreeing with you.", "she did and basically told him it was ok.", "No you're absolutely correct, this is exactly what I was talking avout! Thank you! My bad, it had been awhile since I initially heard this story. I'm going to correct my comment now!", "I\u2019m trying to figure out wtf you could be doing in your car, especially an old person, that you miss an entire light. Not catching the first few seconds of a light is one thing but you missed and entire light AND he beeped. That\u2019s no minor mistake. I\u2019d be mad too BUT he did handle it wrong.  He shouldn\u2019t be telling a t strangers that\u2019s why he needs to be talked to.\n\nEdit: I just re-read it, how could I forget she ran a stop light for a u turn also. The only defending this lady needs is got the mom to tell her son not to talk to people like that.", "But I do daily and the world is on their phone at lights. If you get road rage at all of them you're going to stroke yourself out in no time and the road rage drivers won't let the ambulance through.", "I so miss my moonroof for this exact reason.", "Most people don't roll down their windows to scream at them vs just venting in their car. \n\nIf you're that focused at being angry at someone, you're not paying attention to the road.", "You seem to be a big problem.", "She ran a red light to do a u-turn. And impeded traffic. And then lied about the incident.", "without question. and if you are doing things like driving- you are going to experience far worse things than someone not turning than illegally u-turning so you're stuck at a light.\n\nthis didn't cause any damage to the car. how will he respond when he gets into a accident?", "Lmao yep and if you call a man a \u201cdick\u201d you\u2019re. Sexist and need to do better too right? \ud83d\ude02", "Don\u2019t bother with this one. He posted that road rage is \u201cnormal behavior \u201c \ud83d\ude44 Then blocked me LOL", "Thank you!", "It\u2019s ok to not pay full attention to the road while the car is sitting still. You do understand that, right?", "And you're ignorant"]}
