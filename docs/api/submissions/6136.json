Thats not okay.", "No she simply rejected it and realized she should have taken it and now she wants it.", "So is the issue whether someone is TA for what happened in the situation or whether they\u2019re TA for not including enough detail in the post?", "Yes, money she is entitled to because she has primary custody of his children. They both need to grow up and stop playing silly games because they have dependents. But depending on why they split, I get the anger. She should have contacted the courts though rather than his parents and sorted it out legally. No need for power games then as done via legal process. I also wonder why HIS parents are on HER side.", "Nearly all family courts will allow litigants to represent themselves.  They even have court employees who will explain the process and offer instructions on filling out the paper work.  It's not hard, I've done it.", "Depending on the country, she would just need to go through the child support office", "Child support is a pretty cut and dried matter in most states these days (assuming USA).  You don\u2019t need an attorney though if you can afford one, that is more desirable.  In many cases family court will appoint one if you can\u2019t afford one.  There are generally not filing fees for family court matters in my experience.  If this is a support matter, the court IS the place to handle disagreements.", "It doesn\u2019t cost a dime to go down to the courthouse and file for child support.", "No I was more just pointing it out because the person I responded to was acting as if the original commenter should have just known this, the tone just seemed condescending. Of course they missed it, because it wasn\u2019t in the post.", "She rejected it and called his money dirty she was disrespectful to him and now suddenly wants his money. Stop acting like OP is entitled here. She acted like  an AH and that she was too good for his money. Btw she isnt confirming to peoples questions if it is towards child support or if he is paying it already. He isnt entitled to just say yes when she asks for money either and he didn't say no he just asked her to simply ask nice.", ">It\u2019s in comments she\u2019s made. Certainly should have been in the main story.\n\nAgreed, that makes it seem like an afterthought and reaction to the YTAs.\n\n She'd probably have put it in her main post if that was her primary concern.", "But are they in the US?", "Somewhat dependent on where they are. But for the most part doesn't matter if it's one year or ten. In most of the US in the absence of a separation agreement in the eyes of the law they are just as married as any other married couple. ESH in my opinion.", "Ahhhh ok, yeah I get it. I can see that. \n\nI have a feeling this might be one of those posts where it doesn\u2019t really take off until after the judgment window. OP needs to put that info in an edit.", "Wow! Is it in the US?\n\nIn Brazil we joke that pretty much the only thing that can send someone to jail for sure is not paying child support. Famous people got arrested because of it. \n\nI hope you and your family are doing alright! Happy New Year!", "Sounds like she had a dumbass power play in return and it backfired.  It's on her as much as it's on him.", "He put his dumb ego above his kids. I don't see how that's better.", "Did it tho, or is he just even more pissed and less likely to cooperate", "He didn't even deny it though and they're apparently not even divorced", "Per OP-\u201cI refused to take any financial help from my estranged husband because I was really hurt and angry\u201d. So for over a year she refused his money. This isn\u2019t on him. It\u2019s on her. Not only that but if it were for child support that would definitely be in the main post. I think when op saw she wasn\u2019t getting the support she thought she would she added that it was child support to change the tides. Either way SHE refused help for over a year that\u2019s not on him. All he did was say hey ask nicely and she couldn\u2019t even do that and when things didn\u2019t go her way she ran and involved other people.  Take the child support angle out of it. How is any of that ok?  It\u2019s not", "Actually she came and asked, he was a dick lording it over her saying ask nicely and then she again refused dating shove his money up his ass, OP clearly puts her own pride above her children.\n\nAnd to be honest I'm doubtful we're getting the truth. It being child support would definitely be something would definitely be something mentioned in the core post, not in some comments later", "No, I'm pretty sure he could just do the right thing here.", "Thank you for having a little nuance", "Please explain: how is this \"pretty gay\"?", "OP originally refused because she was so angry and hurt. When she asked a year later, he made a comment about her now wanting his \u201cdirty money.\u201d \n\nI wonder what led to the divorce.\n\nOP should have put more details in the post.", "Is he asking nicely for her to spend *her* money when she pays for the kids' food and clothes?"]}
