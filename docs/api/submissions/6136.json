You decline.\n\nA year later, you want the money. He asks you the bare minimum of at least asking him nicely for it, and you still can't do that for potentially thousands of dollars? You don't owe it to him, but he doesn't owe you the money either, but damn you never really swallowed your pride like you said, did you?\n\nThen you go to HIS PARENTS, and do something YOU KNOW he doesn't like (talking about your relationship dramas) to make him look bad and coerce him to give you the money.\n\nNah, YTA every step of the way here.", "YTA\n\nYou can't ask someone for help then act like an asshole to them, and then turn your EX in-laws against him too, when you're obviously in the wrong as well. You were the one that didn't want his money so why are you setting up his parents against him if you don't want to ask in a nice way. You're acting entitled", "Actually YTA for the way you handled it.  The drama wasn\u2019t necessary.\n\nJust get a lawyer and get a proper separation agreement in place which should include any financial support you are entitled to.", "Yes, YTA. \n\nThe scales of justice have a funny way of balancing don\u2019t they? \n\nYou\u2019re ESTRANGED and that\u2019s all we need to know to render judgment here.", "You\u2019re separated.\n\nIs he court-ordered to pay you alimony during the separation period? If not, he owes you nothing until a court order demands that he provides you with financial support.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to ask him for money, you should have asked nicely. Now you\u2019re probably not even going to get a dime because you tattled on him to his parents.\n\nYTA.", "Info: just curious, but why would he say his money is \u2018dirty\u2019", "YTA You expect your EX to give you money? Get fucking real.", "YTA. You ran to his parents and tattled on him like a 5-yo, instead of adulting and taking care of your own business. Get a lawyer if you think you\u2019re entitled to some of his money. And next time, don\u2019t let your pride get in the way of reality.", "\nYTA - you didn\u2019t need to tell the ex in laws \n\nhowever, the fights etc? You\u2019ll have to live with it. Take it as lesson learnt with being too prideful for saying no when he offered. \n\nINFO: do you have children together?", "YTA \n\n? Why would you call his parents to tell him about it when you know he didn\u2019t even say no? He was just pulling your leg asking for you to ask nicely, you aren\u2019t entitled to anything.\n\nYou turned down the offer to get money (which is crazy) because of your pride. And you talked to him rudely after asking him for money. What makes you think he\u2019ll give you money after you do that?", "YTA for not acting like an adult.\n\nAn adult would have asked nicely and if he had said no, would have accepted it.\n\nUntill he's court ordered to give you money, he doesn't owe you anything.", "So you told a lie to his parents about him refusing to give you money. You lied because you knew the chaos that would unfold when you did. You lied because you knew they would side with you despite your lies.\n\nNow I see why you\u2019re separated. YTA", "YTA.  What are you, 6?\n\nHe offered, you declined.  You have a *hell* of a lot of nerve, even asking, after that.  He had every right to be a little petty.  And even then, he *didn't* say \"no\".\n\nThen, you ran to *his* parents, who you have no business even interacting with, to *tattle*.  Like a child.\n\nAnd your accusation isn't even true!  All he really did was expect you to be polite, about it!  He's got no obligation to be nice, to you.\n\nHonestly, I'd love to hear the (actual) reason why you're separated.  Considering he even offered to help you and you're acting like this; I'm gonna guess he's justified.", "YTA\n\nYou said no and now you can't even be bothered to ask nicely. You want his money? Go to court and fight for some. Otherwise, you aren't entitled to a penny", "YTA. And unbelievably immature. Or maybe just openly malicious. It's hard to tell sometimes. But honestly I struggle to believe this is even a true story. If it were mine, it'd be my best kept secret...", "Yta you specifically told him you didn't want to be financially supported by him but when it got tough and you needed help you ran to him he has a legal right to say no including if you asked him not to support you. Then, to go to his parents and tattle on him, that's just extremely childish, including the fact that they always side with you and never give their son a chance to even defend himself which in itself is just sad cause who's to say your the one lying and he's telling the truth?", "YTA\n\nYou should communicate through lawyers, you\u2019re both incapable of being civil human beings.", "Sooooo - how often did you go to his parents to get your way when you were together? That would explain not being together anymore.", "INFO\n\nDo you have kids together, and what is the custody situation.", "You both sound like children. ESH", "ESH\n\nThere's a lot of missing information to make a decision on whether or not it's okay to ask for money in this case, but it's obvious that you went to his parents just to piss him off and he was an AH too because he was playing you and wanted to make you mad.\n\nVery immature on both sides.  If you want a divorce, do it the proper way with a lawyer and see what you'd be legally entitled to, and have your lawyer handle the communication.  If you don't want a divorce, work on a strategy to save the relationship.  Anything else is just silliness until it goes one way or the other.  \n\nBig issues first, then deal with the smaller ones afterwards.", "YTA and a drama queen", "YTA\n\nYou are separated. Unless you have children. He is no longer financially responsible for you.", "INFO. I suspect this guy was quite unpleasant to say the least with his \"dirty\" money. His parents seem to think so. He seems to have wanted OP to grovel. OP we need more details.", "I really hope that y'all don't have any children. ESH.", "YTA", "YTA. Are you a child?", "ESH. \"I never actually said no\" is a childish game to play. So was telling his parents on him.", "ESH. Stop letting him get to you. Ask for money that you deserve and don't let him egg you into a fight for his enjoyment. \"Telling\" on him to his parents seems childish too. Get what you're owed yourself so you don't have to do that.", "NTA Your in-laws are awesome! Your ex technically didnt say no, but he didnt say yes either and quite frankly was a bit of an AH when you asked - the way i understand your post, he was rubbing your face in it with the sarcastic 'ask me nicely' comment, trying to make you beg for it!
