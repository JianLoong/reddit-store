Also why are you still seeing his parents if he's estranged?\nLet them all go and move on", "ESH, stop with the drama. Go to court and get a child support order and avoid all the drama. Child support isn't about you or your relationship or your pride, it's money owed to your children by their other parent.", "YTA golddigger", "YTA 100%. A true nightmare ex....", "Basically YTA, but you've left out so much information here, it's possible you're not.\n\nI mean, you don't even say that you have kids with this guy, you don't say if he's already paying his legal obligations to you, and this is over and above what he owes you.\n\nAnd tattling to his parents isn't very mature.\n\nI'm going with YTA, but I feel that you have probably left out a load of useful information.", "YTA", "Oh, hi AH.", "YTA, you keep letting your pride make an ass out of you. You lied to your in-laws, painted your estranged husband as the villain (he's not, at least in this scenario) and cheated yourself out of the money.\n\nApologize, and next time he tells you to ask politely...ask politely. If he's not giving child support, go to court and at least stop BS-ing around with this mess.", "This is the correct answer.  Go to court, get a legal settlement and child support.  If OP can't afford it, ask the in-laws to borrow money until they reach a settlement.  It was foolish to decline it all, especially with kids involved, but this is not the way to handle it now.", "What OP left out, but has commented on is they have children together. She\u2019s asking for some financial support for them.", "Bullshit. She was married to him. That money is half hers. She may have (very stupidly) said no to her half of the money - probably because, like you, he implied it was a favor or him being generous. Fuck. That.  It was (and is) half hers. No judge had decreed them divorced or given him 100% of the marital assets. She doesn\u2019t have to beg or demean herself for her share. \n\nAnd that\u2019s BEFORE we get to the fact that it appears this was money for the kids.  Still no.  She doesn\u2019t have the legal right to decline child support on their behalf. And she certainly gets to revisit it when circumstances changed, even after divorce, which again hasn\u2019t happened here.", "It isn\u2019t *someone*. It is her goddamn husband. That money is hers, just because she didn\u2019t take it doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t have a right to it. Considering the parents *immediately* came to her side tells you how much a tool he is being.", "Well, OP left out a crucial detail\u2026 they have kids together and she has primary custody. So he should be paying child support, but she needs to go about it through the proper channels.", "I have a feeling he said \"dirty money\" because OP called it that before. Probably doesn't agree with whatever profession he is in. \n\nAlso, after denying the support and coming back after a year demanding money? I can see wanting to make the other person \"grovel\". Especially when you are estranged", "Even with children he is not financially responsible for OP. He is half financially responsible for the children. OP is responsible for the other financial half.", "Was he supposed to ram the money down her throat when she refused it the first time? All he wants now is for her to ask nicely", "What response is he supposed to have when his estranged wife who insulted his money and turned it down suddenly comes back demanding it?", "So she wants child support? Should've just gone to court then", "So? He offered her money, she said no. Thats her problem. I highly doubt he isnt covering costs in some way for the kids, otherwise OP would have definitely told his family.", "She said no and on top of that waited a year? If this story is legit then OP is an even bigger AH.", ">Bullshit. She was married to him. That money is half hers.\n\nThis isn't a divorce proceeding or a judicial judgement- this is him giving her money outside of a court agreement. If she wants half the money, she should go to court.\n\n>She may have (very stupidly) said no to her half of the money - probably because, like you, he implied it was a favor or him being generous.\n\nQuite literally, it is him being generous, as, once again, this is NOT A DIVORCE PROCEEDING, NOR A COURT BOUND AGREEMENT.\n\n> Fuck. That. It was (and is) half hers.\n\nWhat about half her stuff that's his?\n\n>No judge had decreed them divorced or given him 100% of the marital assets. \n\nWhat even are you talking about? Whos to say he even has 100%? What about her assets?\n\n>She doesn\u2019t have to beg or demean herself for her share.\n\nThen go to court.\n\n>And that\u2019s BEFORE we get to the fact that it appears this was money for the kids. Still no.\n\nSo she can't swallow her pride, like she lied she did, and feign some groveling and get money for her kids?\n\n>She doesn\u2019t have the legal right to decline child support on their behalf.\n\nShe actually does.\n\n>And she certainly gets to revisit it when circumstances changed, even after divorce, which again hasn\u2019t happened here.\n\nIf she wants it against his consent, she is going to have to go to court. If she wants it with, she has to come to an agreement with him.", "Bullshit don\u2019t matter if there were fucking still his money isn\u2019t hers simply enough. Marriage doesn\u2019t mean you just get entitlement to another persons stuff", "You should add in that you have children together, and what you\u2019re asking for is really child support. It changes the story completely.", "This is needed context in the post.", "Is the money you are asking for child support or on top of child support he is already paying?", "It is her EX whose money she didn't take, if she wants it now she can go to court if she does have right to it. And parents taking sides really doesn't day much, op seems to play the victim very well.", "Where does it say he pays CS?", "His kids are.", "Your married spouse is entitled to half your post marital total familial income. If you\u2019re legally married and they were a SAHM you still have to support them the same, if you stop you\u2019ll lose extra in the divorce.", "Not sure how it works while separated, while he should be providing child support is he legally required to. Once divorced there would be an order in place outlining what he has to pay.", "Maybe she shouldn't be the custodial parent then \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Court costs money. Money OP doesn't have.", "You can\u2019t get child support while still married. That\u2019s a divorce thing and they\u2019re not divorced", "It isn\u2019t her problem. They\u2019re married. They are his children too. It is *their* problem.", "Legally, it literally does.  It\u2019s called marital property. All the money that was out in the bank accounts while they were married - half hers (give or take) without a prenup. House and car, probably half hers. They have kids, he has them 20% of the time, so he owes child support. She can say she didn\u2019t want it, but in a court of law, they would still grant it because it\u2019s the kids\u2019 money, so he\u2019d be wise to set some aside for arrears later on. It very much DOES mean she is entitled to approximately half of the marital estate.", "Estranged and ex are not the same thing. Are you 12? When you have children, let alone get married, your relationships don\u2019t just end like a person getting ghosted on Tinder.", "Thank god I never married and had kids!", "It\u2019s in comments she\u2019s made. Certainly should have been in the main story.", "It\u2019s in one of the comments. He gets them every other weekend. She has primary custody. I pity the kids living through an acrimonious divorce because the parents act like kids themselves.", "\"He has the kids every other weekend\". She visits his parents because she wants the kids to be able to see them often, not to \"tattle\". OP's ex is a deadbeat dad who isn't spending anything supporting his own kids. A lot can change with kids in a year, totally makes sense she needs money and didn't realize how expensive it was going to be", "Read OPs comments... \ud83d\ude44", "Nope they have fee waivers and a million other ways to get child support", "Child support court is usually free.", "Seems like she was too prideful to ask for her money to support her kids. Unfortunately she screwed up the just asking him process so by burning that bridge she didn't exactly give herself many other options", "Separated a year & no filing for divorce? And no child support paid? She waited a year to ask for funds? Not sure I believe her. Child support is mandatory. She can go online to the court in her area, download the forms, complete & file. She doesn\u2019t need a lawyer for child support.", "actually you can get an order of maintenance. its basically going to court and saying hey judge i need help keeping a roof over our kids heads. they can ordered while the divorce is pending.", "\ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd74 lmao I guess this is why she said in-laws and not ex in laws. Time to get divorced or back together then I guess\nI mean it's been a year come on", "Yes you can.  Legal separation is a thing.", "She was offered it. OP needs to grow up.", "Yea I assumed there weren't any because there is no mention of them at all which is weird and would definitely help her case.", "There should be a court agreement that they follow. While I agree the kids should be cared for maybe she should have thought of them from the jump. Her actions put her in this situation.", "It's kinda hard to financially support kids when the ex refuses money. He sounds like a jerk, but not a deadbeat.", "Lol I skim comments and read main post\ud83d\ude44. Why would important details like this be in the post?", "OP isn't perfect. But neither is her husband. \n\nHonestly I hate dumbass power plays so the husband can get screwed", "Right? Way to bury the lead.\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Well, but then she asked, remember?  For money. Which would go to the kids. And he told\nHer to ask nicely. For him to pay child support. OP never criticized him for not paying *before* she asked. She \u201ctattled\u201d because he wanted her to beg for the funds he got out of paying for a year.", "Sometimes because of word limit, often because posters are dumb. If you click on the username, you can see all the user's comments in one place - can be useful.", "She lied to the parents don\u2019t matter if she ain\u2019t perfect nobody is. Simply enough problem is she\u2019s too prideful then lied when she would just give a nicety that the ex felt he wanted most likely to make up for said pride", "Except he can't because now op's kids aren't provided for. Ex husband def is a huge ass but as a parent you usually think of your kids first if you're struggling that bad. Perhaps ex's parents can loan her money to get the child support from him, who knows", "I literally said the dad is a jerk. But so was she for being too \"proud\" to accept money from him from the date of separation for her kids. Even his request wasn't that out off order. Sounds like she had some sort of moral issue with the way he earns money, hence her taking dirty money. Sounds like he was joking and she was bitter.", "So every time she wants money, she has to beg? Because it won't be a once off, it will be repeatedly.\n\nIf the Husband ever wants it, he can just cut payments whenever and not pay her, and make her beg again. They obviously argued for 20 minutes and he still didn't pay her, so she told on him to his parents.\n\nShe ain't a saint, and I don't know whos fault the divorce is, but there may very well be a reason she doesn't want to get into the habit of begging for money. \n\n>but as a parent you usually think of your kids first if you're struggling that bad. \n\nWell obviously the Husband wasn't thinking of his kids.", "Well then obviously she should go through court, there isn't really another option if she doesn't want to ask or if he wants her to keep asking everytime. \n\nBut acting the way she does now will ensure he will never give her a cent willingly."]}
