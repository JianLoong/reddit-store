If she hasn't exercised her right to visitation in all these years, she's not realistically being deprived of anything but the opportunity to do so conveniently. You know what's best for your family.", "NTA.\n\nIn this case, i can imagine it'd be a good idea to discuss this once more with your daughters grandparents(ex' parents). I don't see a reason why you shouldn't go, and i think they will agree with that(and they were already supportive in the first place). But explicitly talking about how you don't want to abuse your 'custody rights' may help you ease your mind\n\nBut also, your daughters opinion here is far more important than anyone else. If she loves the idea to see and experience south America, then please don't put your and her life on hold because of an absentee mother.", "NTA\n\nCongrats on the big move", "NTA at all and she will enjoy the experience. We moved to Belize for a year when my daughter was 14 and she still has friends from her time at the local high school. We regularly go back to visit and her and I now own a condo. Good for you for giving her this chance to experience a new culture.", "NTA. Enjoy!", "NTA. This is an amazing opportunity for you all! Best of luck!", "NTA", "Renting it out is a great way to assure the ex doesn\u2019t sneak in while they\u2019re gone. But maybe a sign with ex and numbers to call if she ever shows up should be posted near door. You never know.", "Noted this,thank you very much", "Seriously. Who thinks, this is what you want to procreate with? Was he on a drug binge during the entirety of the relationship?", "We will call them,if she genuinely wants to visit her and wants to maintain a relationship and if my daughter is OK,all of us are willing to cover the costs. None of us have financial problems.", "Honestly if we love Uruguay,we also think of buying a house but we have 3 years to think about that.", "I'm colombian,and i'm very offended! Sure,there are unsafe places. But i can assure OP that his little girl will be safe and sound,especially in Uruguay. Saddens me when i read such uneducated,biased and racist/xenophobic opinions. Also,yes,for me too S\u00e3o Paulo was a city that make me feel very unsafe as a woman. But Montevideo? Bogot\u00e1? Medell\u00edn? Buenos Aires, Santiago? Nope,never. Be welcome to my continent OP.\n\nAlso,NTA.", "That's a fact.", "Carrying and birthing a kid can affect a people,like a lot. There is a thing called postpartum psychosis maybe you are not aware of. We both wanted kids a lot,he was planned but the birth was really traumatic and after that,nothing went better. Sure,my ex's decisions and her own doings were a big part of it but sometimes pregnancy and birth can change people a lot.", "Echt? Deutschland? Ffs, just go. Godspeed, good luck, have wonderful experiences and enjoy life with your daughter. If she picks the language up, so much the better!", "Sie kann Spanisch viele sprechen.Tats\u00e4chlich hat sie k\u00fcrzlich ihr B2-Zertifikat erhalten daher kann ich einfach sagen dass sie weniges Problem mit der Kommunikation hat.", "You are NOT from DE, lol. Neither am I. Lived there for most of my life, though. I'm guessing you speak english, german and spanish? More languages than me.", "My life is really complicated.\n\nI am.half Turkish half german,grew up in Turkey until University, studied University and Medical School in UK,did my neurology residency in USA and moved to Germany after my specialty training and Specialized on neurophysiology and especially sleep medicine.Ich kann nicht sagen daher bin ich 100% Deutsch.", "Gracias! Also,your airline is really good. I come from the country of Lufthansa but your sincerity and effort and your food options really surpass the German airlines. We came to Uruguay with a transfer in Chile and to be fair,one of the best airport lounges ever with the food options and the sincerity was remarkable."]}
