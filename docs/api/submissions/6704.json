To your point, she hasn\u2019t cared for the past 10 years so I think it\u2019s just the jealousy coming out in her. As long as you\u2019re legally able to move your daughter out of the country, go for it, enjoy your life and don\u2019t look back.", "From title I was expecting something different. NTA. You and your daughter have fun, she will always remember this trip and it'll hold a special place for both of you. Fuck parents that don't get involved in their kids lives. Baffling how people can be that selfish.", "NTA - You say your child is 15, but mom hasn't really visited since age 5.  If mom didn't want to be one over the past decade, there's no reason to stick around for her now.   Have fun in South America.   Sounds like an adventure for you two.  \n\nMy answer would have been completely different if mom was visiting the child on a regular basis.   I would have said it is wrong to rob the child of visitation with mom, but that's clearly not the case.", "NTA for me I reckon.\n\nI'm a little confused as to what the problem is that you describe at the end.\n\nIt looks like you and your child are perfectly fine to move away to Uruguay. The anger that your ex-partner has seems likely to be driven by their own shame, rather than anything based on the situation. If they had a good relationship with your child and exercised the visitation rights then it would surely be a difficult situation to manage. But that's clearly not the case here.\n\nI think their living situation shouldn't really be any concern when you and your child make this decision. It's really up to the FIL whether they boot them out. I think you don't have to feel guilty or responsible if their own actions cause them negative consequences.", "It took me many, many tries to parse the title. I assume you are asking \"AITA for not telling my ex I moved to South America with our daughter?\"", "nta\n\nshe sounds horrible\n\ngood luck with the move", "NTA \nYour ex obviously hasn't been in your child's life much before, so don't let her hold you back from this opportunity. It would be one thing if your daughter wanted to stay so she could be in contact with her mother, but she is 15 and old enough to make a rational decision and she has. I hope you do take the job offer and I wish you luck in Uruguay.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t abusing any power. You talked to your daughter and asked what she wanted, as well as talked to your ex-wife\u2019s extended family. Everyone has given their blessing except a woman who hasn\u2019t been around for 10 years. Follow your daughters lead here and ignore her and give your daughter a life changing, beautiful 3 years in South America.", "The ex-wife is hated by everyone including her family. Doesn't seem like anyone would miss her if she disappeared. She must truly be an evil sadistic person. The daughter would probably celebrate.", "NTA. If her mother had been involved with your daughter and tried to be a good parent to her  since the divorce, then leaving without discussing would be an AH move, however this isn't the case.  You have been your daughter's sole parent, her mother hasn't been invovled, hasn't stepped up so doesn't get a say in what you and your daughter do or where you go.", "NTA. OP, take your daughter & enjoy this fabulous opportunity. Ignore the ex. This is about power, not her giving a damn about your daughter.", "NTA your ex hasn\u2019t utilized her visitation for 10 years.", "INFO: Did you call your ex directly to tell her or did she find out secondhand?\n\nEven if she isn\u2019t present in the child\u2019s life, she\u2019s still her mom and deserves to be told directly. \n\nIf not, YTA, but not for moving to Uruguay.

It is safer than most of the Central-Eastern European countries and I have been there a lot. Everywhere we went in Uruguay in these 10 days(and yes,I am currently returning from a rural area with my daughter at a bumpy road in an old bus) we saw nothing but compassion and kindness so I might have a biased view.", "I still would have recommended trying so that you could say you tried, but if she doesn\u2019t answer your calls then there\u2019s not much you can do about it.
