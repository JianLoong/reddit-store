{"id": 24118, "submission_id": "15ksab3", "title": "AITA for not attending my best friend's wedding because it was on the same day as my dog's surgery?", "selftext": "So, a bit of background. I've had my dog, Max, for 10 years. He's been with me through thick and thin, and I consider him family. A few months ago, he was diagnosed with a life-threatening condition that required surgery. After multiple vet visits and consultations, the only available date for the surgery was set, and it happened to be the same day as my best friend's wedding.\r  \n\r  \nMy best friend, Sarah, and I have known each other since we were kids. We've been through a lot together, and I was honored when she asked me to be her maid of honor. I was involved in all the wedding preparations, from dress shopping to organizing the bachelorette party. Everything was going smoothly until I found out about Max's surgery date.\r  \n\r  \nI immediately called Sarah and explained the situation. I told her that I couldn't miss Max's surgery as it was a matter of life and death. I hoped she would understand, but she was devastated. She said that she had been dreaming of this day her whole life and couldn't imagine me not being there. She also mentioned that everything was already paid for, and finding a replacement on such short notice would be impossible.\r  \n\r  \nI felt torn. On one hand, I didn't want to let Sarah down on her big day, but on the other hand, I couldn't bear the thought of something happening to Max while I was away. After a lot of thought, I decided to prioritize Max's surgery.\r  \n\r  \nThe day of the wedding, I received multiple texts from mutual friends saying I was selfish and that I should've been there for Sarah. Some said they understood my decision, but many were upset with me. Sarah hasn't spoken to me since the wedding, and our friendship seems to be on the rocks.\r  \n\r  \nI feel guilty for missing such an important day in Sarah's life, but I also feel that I made the right decision for Max.

My decision led to potential disruptions in the wedding plans, emotional distress for my best friend, and disappointment from mutual friends who expected me to be there. While I had a valid reason related to my dog's health, the timing and sudden change in plans might have come across as inconsiderate or selfish to some, especially given the importance and once-in-a-lifetime nature of a wedding. My choice to prioritize my pet over a lifelong human friendship has created a rift, and that's why there's a debate over whether I was in the wrong.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

However, decisions like the one you made have consequences.  You did prioritize your dog's surgery over your bf's wedding at which you were supposed to be MOH.  That completely changed her wedding, and absolutely has consequences for your friendship.  \n\nYou're not the AH, and neither is she.  But it will probably take a good long while to come back from this, if you can come back from this at all.", "I go back and forth on this one and so I'll ultimately rule NAH. This isn't a simple \"who is the AH\" situation. Both things were important and in a lot of ways it's just an unfortunate reality of timing.\n\nPets are members of the family, and as a pet owner myself, I understand the anxiety and fear that something may happen in a situation like this and that you could lose your best pal. I don't really knock you for wanting to prioritize that. It is, however, not a situation that needed your physical presence, though I understand that you being physically present may have helped your own anxiety. You typically drop the animal off and then spend the day waiting for news. I've usually been encouraged NOT to wait in the vet waiting area since it takes all day, and often they keep the animals overnight for observation. If, god forbid, the dog passed in surgery, your presence wouldn't have changed that. Your goodbyes would've already been said at drop-off. That might sound callous, but it's the truth.\n\nIt's a bit misleading to say that you simply missed the wedding as if you were a guest - you agreed to be her maid of honor, a role that comes with some significant day-of responsibilities. While I don't think anyone else's life should stop because their friend is getting married, it's not like the dog was rushed into emergency surgery that morning. It was a planned event. Meaning, I see her perspective that someone else could've been in the waiting room for you, or the doctor could've called you with updates, etc. etc. From her view, what difference would there have been between waiting in a waiting room at a vet clinic versus waiting for news while fulfilling what you agreed to at her wedding?\n\nFrom your view, I can see where you may feel some difference. Anxiety isn't always rational, or you may have just wanted to feel better about yourself by being close by, or \"on-call\" in case something happened. You may not have felt emotionally equipped for what the outcome of that surgery might've been. It might've been the best call for you to not go to the wedding, but decisions have consequences, and I think she gets to be upset.\n\nI think the way you go about explaining this to her is that you didn't feel like you would've been mentally present on her wedding day, that you would've brought the mood down, and you would've been too worried about missing a call from the vet to be a good support to her. She may or may not accept this, but from what you're saying, I think it's probably your truth. I think time might be able to heal this wound, especially if you have years of friendship under your belt. However, I think you should prepare yourself for a reality where you may not be BFF's with this person any longer.", "NAH, but usually surgery for dogs is an early morning drop off situation, and it\u2019s often possible to pay for them to keep the dog overnight afterwards. It seems to me that there would have been a way to get the surgery done and still be there for your friend.", "I don\u2019t think this is as simple as being an AH or not. I get that pets garner all the love that children do. I get that missing your friend\u2019s wedding over this hurt her deeply. Have you acknowledged her hurt? Or have you simply defended your actions? \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but\u201d doesn\u2019t work here.\n\nIt IS a situation when you could have had someone else take the dog\u2014and as for dates, I know that sort of thing is hard to change. This is going to require humility on your part\u2014and time. If you want to repair the relationship, I wouldn\u2019t view it from the perspective of who is being an asshole\u2026it is about two friends whose concerns were in different areas at an inconvenient time, and it will require tolerance and sensitivity, not a battle of who is right.", "I mean you made a value judgement about your friend's wedding, where you were her MOH, and your dog's surgery. You're entitled to make that call but I wouldn't expect her to be your friend again after that.\n\nNAH", "NAH. You did let your best friend down on her wedding day, and I think she's entitled to be upset. But I get that if you cannot move your dog's surgery around, you have to prioritize it. This is just one of those horrible situations where nobody is wrong and you're all entitled to be upset about it.", "I'm skeptical about \"the only available date\". Was it \"the first available date\" or the only date ever in the history of your vet? I have to ask why you couldn't have tried to schedule for the next available date. Would the dog have died if you delayed it to a few days later? You made a promise to your friend and right or wrong, Every time she thinks about her wedding day she will remember her best friend backing out at the last minute and it will make her sad. ALL her life.", "Info:  Is there no way you could have gotten the day of the surgery changed? \n\nIt seems like you had some advanced notice, so I would guess if you said \"I'm traveling that day\" or something to that effect, they could have worked with you. \n\nIf you didn't even try to move it around, I'd say YTA. \n\nIf you did and there was truly no other option, then NAH.", "Tough situation, but if she really is your best friend she would understand how important Max is to you.\n\nThe other friends can butt out. This is between the two of you.\n\nNAH.", "\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \nEdit: I just found that OP posted this twice, once as a MoH giving up her duties, and once as a best man giving up HIS duties.

There was a ton of stuff that you were responsible for, things you were expected to do, which she then likely had to delegate for you because of your decision not to show.\n\nYou broke your promise to your oldest friend for nothing. And I don't mean your dog is nothing. I mean that your dog didn't need you at all. There was nothing that you could do for your dog. You being there had no effect on the outcome of the surgery. You basically sat around waiting to hear how the surgery went.\n\nI also doubt it was the only day the surgery could be done. Even though it was life-threatening, it obviously wasn't an emergency as you scheduled the surgery and simply took the first date they offered. I'd be willing to bet that you could have said you had a conflict and they would have found you another date.", "YTA\n\nLook, you weren\u2019t going to be in the room with the dog during surgery, so if something went wrong, you would have already said your potential goodbyes beforehand no matter what. Your presence in the waiting room would not matter. . \n\nYou could have arranged to drop Max off the day before, then gone to the wedding, and picked him up the next day. And if something went wrong where your presence somehow mattered you could have had the vet call you and left the wedding.", "YTA, I know this might be emotionally hard to recognize but you being there for your dogs surgery will have no affect on it. You won't be in the operating room, if something were to go wrong there would be nothing you could so to fix it, the dog will not care and does not understand if you are there or not. Your friend however will remember forever how her best friend and maid of honor dropped out of her wedding last minute to sit in a vet office waiting room. You should have had a friend or family member take the dog to the surgery and went to the wedding.", "YTA.  Weddings are planned months in advance.  You couldn't have begged the veterinary office for a different date and explained the situation?  Because working for a veterinary surgeon, I absolutely know you could have. They're literally humans who love animals so much they dedicate their lives to them, they'll help you.  You accepted the first date with no argument and messed up your \"best friend's\" wedding for nothing.", "NTA\n\nYour mental health trumps over any wedding or party. \n\nYou probably were very stressed, anxious, and maybe even at the brink of tears. That is not a good state to go to a party and risk becoming the unwanted attention center if anything happened.", "NTA These comments are unbelievable. No, a wedding is not more important than your pet. And what if you did leave and something went wrong? No way a wedding trumps that.\n\nThough there's nothing you could've technically done, you wouldn't have been in a celebratory mood anyway. A true friend would understand that and have compassion for your situation.", "YTA. You prioritized your dog over a friend in what is arguably one of the most memorable moments in their life and considering your history, you've been friends WAY longer than you've had your dog. \n\nYour presence at the vet would do nothing to change the outcome of the surgery. In all likelihood, your vet kept your dog overnight for observation anyway, so you what, sat at home waiting?\n\nYou chose an animal over your best friend. I would not be surprised if that title is no longer yours...", "Info: why was that the only available date for the surgery? Does your vet team know about the conflict?", "NTA", "YTA", "NTA, this was a serious emergency. It\u2019s sucks that you had to miss the wedding, but I think you made the right choice.", "Anyone who says YTA has probably never had a dog.", "If you've known each other since you were kids, then she has known Max his entire life and knows how important he is to you.

There\u2019s numerous things you could\u2019ve done to manage both but clearly you chose a dog who\u2019s got maybe 7-8 years(if you\u2019re lucky) over a life long friendship. Good luck having a support system when max inevitably passes since you\u2019ve shown through your actions how shitty of a friend you are. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong for loving your dog however you don\u2019t get as much time with pets and it\u2019s a part of life. This coming from someone who recently lost a dearly beloved pet.", "NAH. I mean, if it were me, as the fricking MOH, I would have chose to go to the wedding and have someone else take the dog in (if that was an option). But, I'm not a huge pet person so I'm biased.", "NAH - if the surgery couldn't be moved without increasing risk to the dog.\n\nAs much as you'd love to support your friend in her wedding day, the reality is the thought that your loved one might die that day is going to pull your heart strings even more. Even if you went while the dog had surgery, the bride would not be your top priority and you'd be distracted. \n\nIt doesn't matter that it's \"just a dog\". You clearly love the dog and the love hormone is exactly the same as if it was a human. The fear of losing them is the same as well.", "NTA\n\nJust an unfortunate circumstance. I say NTA instead of no a-holes because she's freezing you out. It was an important reason to miss. Could you have had someone else take your dog to surgery? Maybe. That would likely be much more stressful on the animal. Besides, you love him.\n\nI don't see how it's impossible to find a replacement on such short notice. Promote the next bridesmaid down the line... surely she is also a trusted friend. The wedding hopefully still went very well. It would seem to me that she is holding it against you as a \"betrayal,\" not because you actually ruined the wedding.", "You may not be the AH technically but if I were Sarah I wouldn't talk to you ever again and that would be justified.", "YTA! You found out about the life or death surgery/ sickness 6month ago! And the only possible date in this whole time is one this day? And even this were really true you could have gone to another vet to check for another date! \n\nEven though I appreciate you loving you pet this makes you a terrible friend! Decently the AH for not trying to find a better solution", "NAH, it was a tough decision no one is at fault it\u2019s just life circumstances. Your not blamed for caring for you dog in a serious situation, but Sarah has the right to be upset that her good friend and MOH is dropping out of her wedding last minute.", "You made the right decision. Max is your family. Your Not The Ass\u2026 in time, maybe she\u2019ll see that too.", "NTA --- I couldn't care less what was going on if my pet was going to have life-saving surgery my pet comes first, my pet is MY FAMILY some people think may think it's only a pet but to me, my pet is my everything. as far as I'm concerned you did the right thing and I hope your dog is now OK.", "NTA - your friend has the right to be hurt, but freezing you out is a bit much. And the upset friends who texted are AHs. Likely you would have been extreemly worried and wouldn't have been yourself if you had attended. Then everyone would be upset that you weren't fully happy and focusing all positive energy on the bride. It's a no win situation. Hope Max is doing better.", "Which one of the two - your best friend or your dog - has been there for you the most? Who has cuddled with you when you felt like crap? Who was happy to see you every day?\n\nYeah NTA. Not even a little.", "If she was truly your best friend, she would've understood how much the dog meant to you, I would think. That being said, we had our elderly dog have some teeth removed, which required being put under, and we had to wait most of the day because he was in post-op observation I imagine you could've gone to the ceremony and made it back before he was ready to go home. Nta dogs are family too.", "NTA.  Max comes first. No contest", "Tell her you will make her next wedding.", "NAH.\n\nI completely understand why Sarah would be upset and disappointed that her MOH wouldn\u2019t be at her wedding at all. I don\u2019t think that decision can be made consequence-free.\n\nThat said, having dealt with a \u201clife threatening but not immediate emergency\u201d condition with a dog, yes it can be hard to get a surgery scheduled, and yes you take the date they offer. And while I did drop off my dog and go about my day (it was a weekday so I did work), I was also glued to my phone so that if any situation arose, I was available to confer with the vets if a decision needed to be made on a short timeline. The situation was not conducive to being respectful for a ceremony and reception, because turning my ringer off would not be an option.\n\nAt the end of the day, I don\u2019t think these mutual friends matter much. I wouldn\u2019t be giving them a whole lot of benefit of the doubt if they went straight to scolding me. If these friends can\u2019t at least grant you some grace and understanding (even if they disagree with your choice or would have made a different decision themselves), then they don\u2019t get who you are and who Max is to you, and they aren\u2019t actually the kinds of friends you need. And as harsh as this may seem, it is also entirely valid for Sarah to decide that if you\u2019re willing to choose Max over her, then you aren\u2019t actually the kind of friend she needs.", "NAH. I get that your friend is upset that you won't be there due to your sick dog. But, I also think it's very understandable that you want to be there for your dog on the day of his surgery. Pets are family to a lot of people and I can see why you want to be there just in case. I would never forgive myself if I went to a wedding and my pet passed away.\n\nI also think there's way too much emphasis on weddings these days.", "Keeping the animal at the vet after the surgery doesn't take the stress you have about it, specially if the animal is old and the surgery is a major one. \n\nI can bet OP tried to envision all the possibilities and end up choosing the one that affected them less and that, if something bad happened, wouldn't picture them as the bad friend for crumbling down or running off.", "Can you imagine trying to enjoy a wedding while worrying about your dog? Couple hours in she gets a call that something went wrong and her dog passed, should she just keep tending to the bride?", "I agree that may be possible, but I would not be willing to go to a wedding or anything like that if my dog had surgery. Whereas it may be possible to do what you're saying, I completely understand someone not wanting to try to make both work.\n\nI don't think anyone was an ass hole here (other than maybe the \"best friend\" having people call and text op).", "I can understand not wanting to have someone else take the dog and also wanting to make myself easily available (glued to phone, ringer on) all day. The vet will pass along any last minute info and next steps at drop off. I want to hear that firsthand.  They will call with updates, including if something goes sideways and we need to make a quick decision. I would be completely unwilling to silence my phone even during a wedding ceremony, knowing the vet could potentially need to reach me. And if something does go sideways, the guilt I\u2019d feel about not having that last car ride and not being the last person my dog saw before being taken back by a tech would last far longer (and that\u2019s me - not everyone will feel the same and that\u2019s okay!) than the guilt I\u2019d feel about not being at my friend\u2019s wedding.

She obviously either doesn't care that much about her dog, or she's blowing the whole urgent-life-threatening part out of proportion.\n\nAlso, most vets from what I've seen don't want anyone hanging around. You leave a number and get out of the building. Generally speaking, you are only required to drop the dog off and sign off on his surgery. The norm is to send the owner home for the duration of the surgery and immediate post-op recovery. It's not like with humans where you're in the room when your dog wakes up. Your dog is generally taken off anesthesia, given a bit of oxygen, and, once he wakes up, taken out for a quick walk and then place back in his kennel until you pick him up.", "\u201cEarliest\u201d, \u201conly\u201d.

Look if you own a pet, it would be wise to call your vet and have them break down emergency and surgical policies. Say you take your pet to an animal hospital because it clearly needs immediate help. BEFORE performing any procedure, regardless if it\u2019s life threatening, they will have you sign a waiver or itemized bill that you are to pay for all incurring cost at the time of service. So, unfortunately, this means that many pet owners are not able to afford immediate care without shelling out hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. If they\u2019re not able to, they offer financing to those that qualify. Sadly this can mean that your pet only receives care to the extent of your bank account. If you go the specialists route, because ideally who wouldn\u2019t want the best for a sick family member, then you\u2019re stuck with a long wait list and again, inflated prices. By the end of it all, your options can whittle down quickly. My point is that vet care is not as accessible as you may think. It\u2019s not as simple as OP should just reschedule", "Yes. Pets are friends, family and constant daily companions. They come first.", "If you don't understand how English works, I would be glad to explain that \"earliest\" and \"only\" are two very different things. \n\nAlso, nobody only has the choice of one clinic. What you're likely suggesting is that it would be costly for her to go somewhere else, which goes back to what I said about my dog's lives being more important to me than her dog's to her.  If I had to drive 5 hours to get someone to perform the procedure sooner, that's what I would do.", "It's not plausible at all. There is no way a vet said, \"your dog is dying and I can only do his surgery in 5 days, because my next surgery day after that is 12 days away and he'll be dead by then.\"\n\nWhat likely happened is they asked, \"is this day okay\" and she answered, \"yes,\" without thinking about the date. If she had said she was going to a wedding, they likely would have offered her another date, or suggested another vet to do the procedure.\n\nIf it was actually urgent, they would have done it immediately and not risked the dog's life. If they said they couldn't be bothered to do it sooner, I would have found someone else to do it.", "Nothing I said was wrong. You apparently don't understand how to use that word. Can you end up with a situation where you can't pay? Sure. That's not this. She said they gave her a date. One. Not a choice, Not any options. Just one day where it would be done. She chose to do it on that day. Now, if she made a post where she said that she had to save up to pay for the surgery and she will finally have the money on the same day as the wedding and can't wait for another appointment, then I would cut her a little more slack, but she didn't mention anything of the sort.   \n\n\nAnd finally, this is a fake post, which proves that she (or he, since the other nearly identical post was written under the same ID but claimed to be a best man dealing with the same dog, issue, etc) is not telling the truth. As such, it's pointless to continue debating something that never happened, and would never happen under the alleged circumstances.\n\nOh, but yes, it really is as simple as rescheduling with someone else if you claim that you care that much about your pet.

We\u2019re done here.", "Then they shouldn\u2019t own pets, and neither should you.", "Pets often come to you as babies, you commit to caring for them for life. \n\nAs this post shows, today's human \" lifelong friend\" is tomorrows estranged former friend.", "Apparently you have no clue how context works (you don't need quotation marks if you are using it in that context). Nice to know you assume all these things about me, but pretend you're not making gross assumptions. Your hypocrisy is noted. \n\nNow, if you read my post again, maybe you can see how I was comparing what I would do to what she would do. I would obviously go much further to care for my pet than she would (which is what you keep trying to imply isn't the case), and I am pointing out that everyone has these options. I'm not saying she would take that option, or that it might not be beyond her means, or anyone's means for that matter, but in a world where someone is debating between MoH and pet surgery, I'm quite confident that she has more than one option.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* As I was writing this I went to look at OP's other posts and found an almost identical one on the topic where she is no longer a MoH, but a best man instead. The basics are the same, and most of the post was copied with the gender parts swapped around. As such, I have no patience to comment further as this is obviously a fake post, and likely never happened.", "lol k", "YTA. You being there isn't going to make the surgery go better. The friendship is probably over, and it's your fault.", "I had to schedule a surgery for my dog a few months ago. Called every specialist vet in a 3 hour radius and the soonest anybody could get me in was over a month and a half later. I totally believe that the surgery could have only been then. \n\nThat said, what OP should have done was had a friend/family member take the dog to the appointment and care for them afterwards. It life or death to get the surgery, not life or death for you be the one to drop them off and wait for them to finish (typically several hours minimum). Extremely inconsiderate of her.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss \ud83d\udc95", "If it can wait until the day of the wedding, it can just as easily wait until after the wedding. If it can't wait until after the wedding, it obviously and absolutely cannot wait until the wedding either.", "I have pets. They'll get put down when the time comes where it's obvious they're suffering more often than not. Pets can't consent to surgery, so owners have the duty to make the call with the pet's best interest at heart, even when that means losing a friend.", "I understand the technicalities. I'm saying how I feel regardless of them. It doesn't have to be rational to you. I worded the question that way because I don't view the scenarios as different. I deadass care about my dogs that much. People can love things that aren't human more than they love a human. Being human does not automatically trump something's value to someone.", "But they're not the same. Entitled to your feelings? Always! Rewriting scenarios because it FEELS close enough? Sure, you can so that too but you cannot expect it to further any kind of discussion. Nor should you be surprised when it's called out.\n\nPlease don't move the goal post. I never disputed that people can't \"love things that aren't human more than they love a human.\" What I said was, no matter how much you love them, they can never be human. Your asking if (dare i say, suggesting) OP would ditch his/her kid is disingenuous at best because the two are inherently different.", "Tell that to grey parrot owners, as well as a lot of turtle species.
