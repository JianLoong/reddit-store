{"id": 30249, "submission_id": "17n155a", "title": "AITA for putting pressure on my sister after she found out her husband got another woman pregnant?", "selftext": "My sister has been married for 10 years and she has three children with her husband. She found out two weeks ago that her husband cheated on her at least a dozen times and got the other woman pregnant. This, of course, has been the most awful thing for my sister and I have been supporting and comforting her ever since she learned what happened.\n\nMy sister has spoken like she is heavily leaning toward staying with her husband so their kids lives don't get turned upside down. She has said that she could not be around the child though and would never accept them. I understand her feelings are all over the place and that she's still raw with all of this. But when she talked about staying and mentioned her feelings for the child I felt like I needed to step in and this is where I might be TA.\n\nSo there is some background as to why I feel so strongly. Our dad was the result of an affair. He was not American and his country of birth did not give divorce as an option. So his father's wife stayed and he ended up with custody of dad. Dad was made to suffer for his birth and it was something that really weighed on dad for the rest of his life. He said he was born hated and he knew he would die hated if his half siblings were still alive in his country of birth. His childhood was miserable and there were times he wondered how he survived his childhood. It was rough and he moved to America young to start anew and have a better life.\n\nWe were told about this a few times and I always think of dad and the pain he carried because of his childhood. So I truly feel divorce is better and especially when it's so easily available here vs what dad went through and what his father's wife went through with no options to leave. This is why I told my sister she shouldn't stay just to keep her kids lives from turning upside down. I pointed out that it was not healthy for anyone. I told her to think of dad.\n\nShe told me I shouldn't be putting pressure on her right now. That she knows what dad went through but this is her kids' lives. It's her life. She told me I wasn't helping anymore and that's what she needed. Help via me listening to her and shutting up about leaving. Then she told me I fucking sucked right now and I should be more worried about her than anyone.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699034825, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17n155a/aita_for_putting_pressure_on_my_sister_after_she/", "score": 2098, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kids know when things aren't right with their parents and forcing a \"happy family\" onto a serial cheater with a baby mama is not going to work. At all. The kids will suffer less if she leaves him and finds someone who will be a true partner and treat her with respect.  She is in denial and seems to think she can just will this away. She cannot, her husband will keep cheating and she will stay miserable and her kids will know about it and it will influence their future relationships for the rest of their lives.                          I get that she feels she needs support from you and not a lecture on things she already knows but she's got BIG decisions to make, and quickly.  NTA but maybe apologize to soften the blow as you don't want her to distance herself but at the same time, it doesn't sound at all to me like she's really thinking of her kids yet.", "I have a half sister as the result of one of many affairs that dad had. It was painful as hell for mom but she stayed because she thought it was the right thing to do. It was never the right thing to do and she became quite bitter because of it. Their divorce was a relief for everyone. \n\nYour BIL has not only betrayed your sister's trust but stomped all over it and thrown it out in the trash. He chose to have an affair and the baby is an innocent victim. Your sister needs some clarity on the situation and her hubby needs his butt kicked. What would happen if he had given her an STI as the result of his dalliance. He was a selfish asshole and now he will be paying for this mistake for a long time indeed.  I wonder if he thought about that whilst he was getting his few moments of pleasure", "NAH for now. Maybe slight AH to you just because it\u2019s so soon after she found out, but honestly if someone keeps venting to us, most of us respond with wanting to help the situation. It sounds like she just wants to be heard. You\u2019re not wrong- her plan, if her feelings don\u2019t change, is not healthy. There are very few instances where I would side with an adulterer but leaving a spouse who treated their child with complete distain- or allowed/encouraged their mutual children to treat the child poorly- is one of them. Sister needs therapy. And she needs time. And then she needs to figure out what is really the best course of action here.", "NAH.\n\nGive your sister some time. 2 weeks is not nearly enough time to make a definitive decision. Her priorities is to her children and to make ensure that they are fine even when their world is broken. Bring up this conversation with her in a couple months and hopefully she considers divorce. It\u2019s absolutely a mess for an affair child to be brought into this world even though it isn\u2019t their fault.", "NTA since I can't possibly judge what the right thing to do would be for her. Your opinion is as valid as mine or your sister's. I dated a girl once who's dad did the same thing. Her mom and dad worked it out and the child born from the affair was accepted as a half brother and remained living with the affair partner. It takes a strong person to forgive and make things work after this. \n\nI've remained friends with this family for nearly 30 years and my observation is that the dad owned his failures and be came the husband and father he needed to be. Not everyone does this so staying is a huge risk for your sister.", "I would say NTA for pointing out that it would be unfair to treat the affair child differently for something that isn\u2019t their fault. However you should not be overstepping when it comes to your sisters marriage and what direction she want to go with all of it. Im nit saying your an AH necessarily, but it does seem like you overstepped.", "Two weeks ago? I'm inclined to agree with your sister. I'm not sure I'd say YTA exactly, but this is a complicated situation with no easy answers, including simply saying \"divorce is the best option.\" If anything I'd encourage her to get some (solo) counseling if she isn't already", "NAH\n\nyour thoughts are justified and she could do with advice right now, but she's right that you're putting pressure on her at a time when she's already got a lot on her.\n\ntry to step back a little - she needs to make her own decisions and reasoning and work things out in her head for herself. this is a huge betrayal that she needs to come to terms with before figuring out how to proceed. be there for her and don't pressure. you can offer advice but please don't push it and if she asks you not to, then don't. she needs support and encouragement most of all.", "In addition to getting tested for STIs, she needs to protect herself if he decides to divorce her (for the other woman). She needs to talk to an attorney about how to protect herself financially, just in case. Stress to her that this is not her deciding to divorce him, it is her making sure that she and the kids are OK if he decides to divorce her.", "NTA This is still too new for your sister. She probably needs more time to change and get used to the idea of being on her own.", "NTA.\n\nMy aunt stayed...she also stayed bitter.\n\nHe was not to be involved with the child as well as pay child support. \nIf you stay you deal with what comes as unfortunate as it is or leave.\n\nSo the affair child had no father and no financial support.\nTo me, that makes my uncle a sh*t father and its no surprise he has a bad relationship with the kids he had with her.\nShe knew what he was about essentially abandoning a child and he emotionally did the same with one of their own children. \n\nI was cheated on, and we got back together. Now he didn't get anyone pregnant, but if he did, I wouldn't stay.\nI don't think I could love that child and that's okay.\nHowever if I took him back, part of the forgiveness is accepting the child as well.", "NAH - This is a serious situation that is going to weigh emotionally on everyone involved, no matter what choice is made. If you continue to press on this, you'll be leaning more towards YTA. For now you need to focus on helping your sister however she needs it, and however her kids need it.", "Soft YTA - I understand where you\u2019re coming from, you\u2019re likely seeing your dad\u2019s life getting played out again. But this isn\u2019t your marriage and it sounds like this is all very, very fresh to your sister who likely doesn\u2019t know which way is up right now. It\u2019s clear you love your sister, but she needs time to think about this and decide what is best for her. \n\nWhat may happen with the child that has not even been born yet is still up in the air; she may come around to the child, she may not. Them breaking up does not necessarily mean that her husband and the woman he cheated with will get together, or that he will necessarily want to be extremely involved in that child\u2019s live. \n\nWhatever you do, be someone your sister can reach out to for support (which I imagine she needs right now), rather than providing unsolicited advice.", "Well. As people have said your sister is in a bad place, as well as her kids and this new baby. She doesn\u2019t have to decide right now what to do, she can take her time. \n\nIf she stays or not, her kids will still have a new sibling. If she hates that kids she will hurt her own kids and create a culture of silence around it. It\u2019s not the new kids fault. No matter what she chooses she will have to learn to understand this. However of course she will prioritize her kids in front of the new one. \n\nMy friends parents stayed together when her dad got a kid with another woman. Her mum never forgave her dad so they just fought about it for 30 years. It really hurt my friend, and the other kid. \n\nMaybe you can help her better by listening and asking questions rather than telling her she is responsible for the happiness of a kid who\u2019s existence (not the kid itself but the fact that there is a kid) has ruined her and her kids lives. Right now that kid is a physical manifestation of her husband\u2019s betrayal. When there is an actual kid hopefully she will see that it is just an innocent child who is not responsible for its parent\u2019s actions", "You sister has enough to be going on with right now, she does not need more pressure.  Ultimately, to stay or go will be her decision.  She has a great deal to think about.\n\nBeside being tested for STDs, she needs to go into counseling.  If her husband is agreeable, he can go to.  If he isn\u2019t, well, there you go.  Cheaters are cheaters and cannot be trusted.  But it is her decision.  Give her your support, maybe not too many opinions unless she asks.", "Did the other woman know he was married? Your sister may have more sympathy for her if she was lied to as well.", "NTA - that is a very real thing to consider when it comes to affair babies. We've seen almost too many posts about the affair baby growing up in a very hostile environment and hated by everyone including potentially their bio parent because they're the reason the affair was brought to light.\n\nYour sister is grieving her marriage, but what you told her needed to be said. If she's serious about staying, she needs to consider the strong possibility the memories of his affair will be in her life for as long as she stays with her husband.", "Shame she doesn't turn that rage on her husband. Once a cheat always a cheat", "NTA but your sister will be if she stays and makes that babies life miserable.", "NTA- it's a conversation she can listen to then accept or ignore. You're not required to agree with a bad decision, especially one you've seen work out poorly for your dad.", "NTA you have first hand experience of what this dynamic can do to a child. Your sister does too. She is being selfish. They only options for this kid would be to have no father in his life at all or a step mother and likely step siblings who hate their guts. Your sister will stew in resentment for decades. She should divorce. Clean his ass up in divorce court. You are not a bad sibling for pointing out its in her best interest to divorce", "NAH except the cheating husband.  You're looking at it from your perspective and trying to make her see outside her own pain right now, and she's not in a place to do that yet.  Right now I think just be supportive, she's dealing with a terrible shock, and it might take a while for her to realize it would be ok to divorce.", "NTA for now.   Yes, it's a little too soon to hear this so quickly after finding out about the cheating.  However, you provided your sister with facts about your dad's experience and she has the information now.  It's up to her.  Don't bring it up again (for now) and let your sister lead when supporting her.  When things settle down and she is able to think things through more clearly she may be more receptive at that point.", "NTA\n\nHere's.thenthing...\nThe kid isn't her responsibility, but behaving in ways that don't do further harm to people affected by her choices IS. AND if she can't welcome.that kid into her life without resentment, she needs to get a divorce.\n\nBecause the husband owes that child parenthood. \n\nNot her fault, not her kids fault, NOT THE OTHER KIDS FAULT, EITHER.\n(And I say this as someone who has been in exactly her shoes.)\n\nI would suggest having her husband move out for a while while she gets her feelings sorted. \nThey both need therapists, pronto.\n\nShe hasn't thought of it yet, but she needs a full STD panel. \nShe's going to feel all kinds of awful when that thought really hits her. The betrayal in this is deep, and it takes a long time to peel back the layers and really feel how you feel.", "NAH\n\nHowever, I would frame it more as what does your sister want her children to see?\n\nIt's not just about parents being together, but parents providing am example of a healthy relationship. Children know when something is not right. This can affect them as much as a divorce can.\n\nWould she want her children to grow up and stay in the same situation? Would she want her children to think it was ok to treat a partner like that? What message is she actually sending?", "Maybe you are a little bit of an AH for  pressuring  your sister but not entirely!\nI would say your sisters husband   is the biggest  AH in this Story, Who in their right mind would  cheat on their wife/husband.\nI think you need to  apoligize  to your sister  and just listen to her and give her some time", "NTA The kids lives are turned upside down. What will happen during their fathers custody days? The kids will meet the baby then. \n\nI want to add that a good marriage is based on trust. How can she ever trust him again? It wasn\u2019t like he tripped and his weiner fell into her vajayjay! It wasn\u2019t just once it was over a dozen times (I would bet closer to a hundred.) He has proven he is ok with cheating and will cheat. How does she know that he only had sec with that  one. woman? Maybe his other affair partners used BC like the  shot, had an abortion of kept the baby but never told him about it. \n\n\u2b50\ufe0fshe needs to get tested for every STD \n\nEven if he never cheats again (extremely unlikely) she would still be raising her kids in an unhappy home/marriage. Every birthday and Christmas she will be reminded of the child\u2019s conception. \n\nMaybe your sister should seek out a child therapist for advice? Go to therapy herself? It sounds like your sister is in denial,", "Nta. Only the husband is. Give your sister some time to come to terms with the reality she's facing and to get through it for now. She'll be a little 'all over the place' currently because it's still new and will need time to process properly before she'll be ready to have that conversation.\n\nAs other commenters have said though, do try and tell her to get checked just in case. He likely wasn't wearing protection and if that's the case then pregnancy is the least of anyones concerns here imo", "NTA - At the moment, your sister is a victim of her husband. But if she chooses to stay under the condition that a child grows up alienated from his family, she becomes the villain.\n\nYour sister should divorce like any rational person should do, not discharge all of her bad feelings on an innocent child.", "NAH, you are both completely correct. There is not going to be a better time for you to say it. Now is the time to let her do what she wants with that information. There is nothing you could have said that would have truly helped anyone, including saying nothing.", "NTA,\n\nI never understood why people stay with cheaters. IMO they're weak. My parents \"stayed for the kids\" and it didn't make us feel better at all. They would yell and scream all the time. I promise you two separate loving households is better than one unhappy house.", "YTA and she told you explicitly why. It's easy for you to talk because it's not your husband, your children and your marriage. Stop projecting, apologize and keep your opinion to yourself until she asks for it.", "NTA. She\u2019s transferring all the blame to the child so she can stay with her husband. You pointed out how awful that is for the innocent child.", "NTA. He would be dead to me for putting my sister through this. Even if my sister decided to stay I would never speak to him again unless absolutely necessary.", "NTA. She's going to give a pass to the man that cheated and lied, but punish an innocent child?", "Staying together \"for the children\" approach is terrible for the children. It creates a toxic environment and is never healthy for them. Along the same lines, though, a change, such as divorce, will also hurt them. The question comes to, which is the lesser evil? IMO, divorce would be the better option. Resentment will settle in between your sis and her husband. She won't be happy knowing what he did and could continue to do. He will keep doing it because he thinks he can get away with it, knowing that she's compliant as she didn't leave. \n\nIt's a terrible situation for your sister and her kids. Unfortunately, it's better to rip the bandaid fast than losing your mind over time. Time will heal so long as she isn't in a constant trauma state. \n\nNTA", "I think that you gave your sister excellent advice.  I am sorry that she lashed out at you because you told her what she needed to hear, not what she wanted to hear.  Since she reacted so negatively, I would just give her space while she deals with the emotions.  Maybe she will come to appreciate your advice, maybe she will resent you for years.  It is done and out of your hands now.  If you talks with your sister were as short and to the point as your description here, I think the only pressure came from your sister's own consciousness.\n\nNTA for speaking the truth.", "Gentle YTA. You can\u2019t choose for her, and if she chooses to stay, you need to support her. You can\u2019t possibly know every single thing about the situation and even if you did it is not up to you.

She has to figure out what happens next, and the best way for her to do that is to talk to someone who will listen with empathy.  Right now, her heart has just been broken, crush, crapped on.  Right now, just let her vent, let her talk.  What comes next can wait till she's at least gotten over the shock and had appropriate time to process and think.", "Hey hey! Kid with parents who divorced before I was born, and had both parents go through divorces even though they had at least two children!\n\n*The kids will know something is wrong. They will blame themselves for causing their mother pain because staying \u201cfor the children\u201d is staying in a harmful relationship for their sake. It will not help them. It will not make it seem like the problem is gone. It will not be a healthy family.*\n\nPlease show her this, as I have had to go through this at least twice now. My mom and stepdad are finally finalizing a divorce, now that we are all adult children, so that\u2019s nice. But my father and stepmother decided that, even though the divorce would go through, that they\u2019d cohabitate to give my two little brothers \u201ca family\u201d.\n\nSaid family resulted in my stepmother\u2019s absolute break down, alienating herself from her family and spewing hateful words at anybody who made contact with her. Equivalent for your sister here is that the husband would be same as my stepmom. She was the problem. She was the cheater.

They *will* grow old enough to ask questions, and they will, most of all, *question the validity of their existence if their parents force themselves to stay in a relationship for the kids\u2019 sake.* My CPTSD didn\u2019t just come from my parents divorcing, that was before I was even born. No, most of it was dealing with my parents refusing to accept that we were not the perfect nuclear family.

Your sister also deserves happiness and to be respected.", "NTA. You might have been a bit harsh but I think it's something she needs to consider. If she wants to stay with her husband then that's her decision but she needs to accept that doing so will mean having some level of contact with the affair baby. Even if the baby-mama gets 100% custody her husband is still hopefully going to have some contact with the kid (unless he's a deadbeat which admittedly might well happen).\n\nAlso she should keep in mind the worse case scenario.

Seems to me that she can feel however she wants about him/her without it becoming a situation like your dad's...", "NTA. No matter what your sister says before the child is born, their marriage won't be tolerable once the child is here. That child is living proof of her husband's infidelity. She will not want to see it or hear about it, much less share marital resources.\n\nHer husband, on the other hand, will feel responsible for the child and will want to be part of the child's life. He will not be able to turn off his feelings the way your sister thinks he will. Every time he goes to visit the child, buys toys or writes a check for child support, your sister is going to resent it.\n\nI don't think you need to intervene any further because this scenario will play itself out in a predictable way.

Which is not a lesson any child should be taught \n\nMaybe what you said came too soon, but I wouldn\u2019t relent on it. Her staying, especially if she\u2019s that torn up, is not good for anyone.

You were just giving her the hard truth.  She needed to hear it.  Your would be TA if you keep going on about it.  The seed has been planted.  She needs to work out what she wants to do.\n\nThe thing is that her husband has managed to ruin or change quite a few lives.

It's far better to tell the truth to them.  It can be in an age appropriate way.  Not telling the truth can change their perspective about the wrong person... but in this case, they'll work out what happened seeing as they are going to have another sibling and the dates and timing.\n\nAnd the worst part is that your sister has admitted she won't accept the child.  She doesn't have to but if she stays with her husband then this child is effectively her stepchild.  He's allowed to have custody and have the child in his house... she doesn't get to be TA to an innocent child who didn't ask to be born (same as your dad).  If her husband stays with her if she's like this, then he's even worse.\n\nIt's also possible that her husband may decide that the AP is the one for him and decide to divorce her.

For 12 more years. Then divorced his cheating ass b/c it just wasn't working for her anymore. She's living her best life now, with a new fab boyfriend.", "NTA you told her the truth. If she later realizes this was a huge mistake you can at least know you tried to open her eyes to the truth. If you stayed quiet and she then realized she may have resented you for not speaking up.

Kids live walking on egg shells as they see the sneer or dissapointment in one parent when they enjoy other parents company and loving both parents is only allowed in secret.\n\nKeeping it together for kids unless you do it without flaw may work but staying for your preservation is just not fair. Split home no kid wants that but loving co parenting can achieve alot and be so much better after adjustment for the kids.\n\nWe lived a best for kids if we portray a family unit to the outside, we grew up watching mom get beat to shit, we got beat and more, we grew up in poverty cause all money was his.

Better to be honest with them from the start, help them move on and let them know that there are consequences to your actions. A divorce would likely be healthier for the children than the children seeing their parents still together after the fact. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t think she can be around the affair child, or if she fears she might grow to hate and resent the child, then she should definitely remove herself from the situation because at the end of the day, this child is innocent, they shouldn\u2019t be blamed or scorned by an adult, and they shouldn\u2019t have to suffer the consequences of their parents\u2019 actions, nor should they have to lose a father when they could otherwise have one (is your BIL interested in being a father to this child?). \n\nHowever, your sister\u2019s going through a lot right now, she owes this woman and her child nothing, and obviously she, her kids and her relationship with her husband are going to be the main priority right now, at least to her.", "NTA, your sister needed the reminder.\n\nShe needs to either divorce her husband or accept the kid as part of the family.

She found out two weeks ago that her husband cheated on her at least a dozen times and got the other woman pregnant. This, of course, has been the most awful thing for my sister and I have been supporting and comforting her ever since she learned what happened.\n\nMy sister has spoken like she is heavily leaning toward staying with her husband so their kids lives don't get turned upside down. She has said that she could not be around the child though and would never accept them. I understand her feelings are all over the place and that she's still raw with all of this. But when she talked about staying and mentioned her feelings for the child I felt like I needed to step in and this is where I might be TA.\n\nSo there is some background as to why I feel so strongly. Our dad was the result of an affair. He was not American and his country of birth did not give divorce as an option. So his father's wife stayed and he ended up with custody of dad. Dad was made to suffer for his birth and it was something that really weighed on dad for the rest of his life. He said he was born hated and he knew he would die hated if his half siblings were still alive in his country of birth. His childhood was miserable and there were times he wondered how he survived his childhood. It was rough and he moved to America young to start anew and have a better life.\n\nWe were told about this a few times and I always think of dad and the pain he carried because of his childhood. So I truly feel divorce is better and especially when it's so easily available here vs what dad went through and what his father's wife went through with no options to leave. This is why I told my sister she shouldn't stay just to keep her kids lives from turning upside down. I pointed out that it was not healthy for anyone. I told her to think of dad.\n\nShe told me I shouldn't be putting pressure on her right now. That she knows what dad went through but this is her kids' lives. It's her life. She told me I wasn't helping anymore and that's what she needed. Help via me listening to her and shutting up about leaving. Then she told me I fucking sucked right now and I should be more worried about her than anyone.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sis has to figure the best way for her and her children.  Listen.  Offer some suggestions, but if she doesn't accept them, then accept her choice.", "NTA!\n\n\nYour sister is willing to forgive her cheating husband, yet wants to punish an innocent child. She probably fears that if the child is around, then so will the other woman. Her children who she's trying to protect, won't thank her for it when they discover they have a hidden half-sibling.\n\nShe's probably still incredibly angry, so her emotions will be all over the place.", "YTA. Your sister is cycling through a lot of emotions rights now and what she wants to do today may not be what she wants to do down the line. She needs time to process everything before making any decisions yet.", "Soft YTA. Your sister is going through a very hard and heavy time. She needs to do what is best for her and her family. You gave her advice now it is time to be supportive and need to bite your tongue with the divorce talk. That is up to her not you.", "YTA. \n\nI understand where you are coming from but to your sister it seems you are putting more emphasis on the affair babies happiness that hasn't even been born yet than the living children capable of suffering right now or your sister. \n\nThere is no telling how your dad's life would have turned out had his father divorced. He could have still been the hated and alienated child anyways. No guarantees that a divorce will fix any of those problems. Your niece and nephews could still blame the new sibling as the reason their parents aren't together. They could bully the sibling for the divorce during shared custody time. It could lead to the wider family rejecting the child due to it causing divorce (grandparents exc). Nothing can be done to guarantee a good outcome. \n\nAt the end of the day your sister is not responsible for the happinesses or quality of life of a child she did not create. Her children are her only responsibility. Asking her to sacrifice them for someone else's baby is asking too much. She shouldn't be making any major life decisions about her children's well being, custody, or living arrangements based on anything but their best interests.", "YTA, especially since ypu're sharing information she presumably already knew.

It\u2019s SO much to take in. Here\u2019s my advice to you: listen, don\u2019t tell her what she should do. Let her vent to you about how much she won\u2019t accept this child. Let her vent about her husband. Let her talk without judging her. She just needs to know she\u2019ll be ok. She\u2019ll probably get divorced eventually, but it\u2019s not your place to tell her when it\u2019s time. Tell her that you\u2019re there to support her now and you\u2019ll be there to support her when/if the time comes to split up. \nHere\u2019s my advice to your sister, as someone who\u2019s been through this:\nDraw a line in the sand with your husband (in your own head, no need to discuss with him) about what you\u2019ll tolerate and what you won\u2019t. You\u2019ll probably move the line a few times. Tell yourself that you deserve a happy, fulfilled life with someone who respects you, so when he crosses that final line and you\u2019re ready, allow yourself to leave. \nAs far as the child. It took me 18 months before I allowed my husband to tell our kids (10 and 7 at the time) and I had finally reached a point where I could talk about this child and say truthfully that the child did not ask for this situation and did nothing wrong. It was better for my children to be able to wait to tell them until I was ready to accept it too. \nI am so much happier divorced than I ever would have been had I stayed. But I understand how your sister feels right now.", "NTA, plain and simple. \n\nI have sympathy for your sister. She\u2019s in a really tough spot. Even though you might\u2019ve grown up in an environment where divorce is acceptable, she might still feel like getting a divorce is something shameful or embarrassing. She\u2019s all over the place right now especially since it\u2019s only been two weeks since everything was revealed. She might think differently even a week from now (I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s likely, but you never know). \nAlso, this isn\u2019t the first time he cheated on her, just the first time he was caught, which is revolting. They\u2019ve been together 10 years and your sister probably feels extremely hurt, betrayed and might think she\u2019s an idiot for not seeing it sooner. \nAll this being said, out of the two of you, you seem to be the only one thinking about things long term. You\u2019re right, there is a high likelihood that the child will grow up with a step mother that resents them for merely existing, just like the way your father grew up. Another thing to add is that she doesn\u2019t wanna get divorced mainly for the kids sake, but when has that ever been the correct way to go? The kids always end up hurt in the end and this situation is no different. Idk how old her kids are, but are they just supposed to happily adjust to a new sibling being around from out of the blue? Because unless your sister and bil explain what happened, then it\u2019s gonna be very confusing for them. These kids are also gonna grow up and mature and they will piece together on their own exactly how their half sibling came to be. They will never look at their father the same way again especially if they\u2019ve been lied to about it for years. \nThis is just my two scents, the only thing I\u2019m gonna say for you is that you could\u2019ve waited a little longer to hit her with the \u2018you should get divorced talk\u2019.
