Quiet sex can still be satisfying.", "Right! You know when you hit them with a light but innocent roast and keep that awkwardness and heated arguments for imbecile\u2019s.   \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb good for y\u2019all too! same with me and my fam not only are we allowed honesty in shared space but it\u2019s funny, respectful, and straight to the point. We the lucky ones you know.", ">Except OP said that her sister apologized and then in the same convo OP asked if they could learn to do it quieter. \n\nIf you apologise, then immediately insist you have a right to keep doing it and have no intention of stopping, you didn't mean the apology.\n\n>OP has no idea if her sister's volume would have changed \n\nYes, because the sister didn't say she'd try to be quieter. Hence the question.\n\n>because she kept pressing during the same convo.\n\nShe asked ONE question. If you lose your shit over a single question and consider it to be \"pressing\", you weren't going to stop anyway.", "there is nothing inherently rude about having loud sex in your own home. I think if the sister had not delivered it the way she did, it would've been received better. Also at some point yea she needs to prioritize her family's own needs and propose a solution. Like hey let me know when bae is coming over and we'll take a walk to the park etc if it's during the day. At night a white noise machine to keep the kids asleep. She should be a gracious guest. The sister dynamic really doesnt help this conflict", "I disagree. At ten years old they should be learning about safe sex, consent, masturbation, sexuality & gender identity, etc. My understanding is that pediatricians recommend that they know this stuff before starting puberty now. They will be entering middle school next year and like it or not will be exposed to these topics by their peers and the internet soon so it\u2019s best it comes from a trustworthy adult before they learn from other less reliable sources.", "Agree with all your points. Every family dynamic is different and not people are as sensitive as others.", "youve obviously never had a sister lmao", "The topics you listed are more general and basic things. Orgasms are a much more advanced topic because it requires a greater understanding of the human body. You\u2019re basically saying that kids should be taught their multiplication tables and trigonometry at the same time. That\u2019s false. They should be taught these things one step at a time.", "Being sensitive isn\u2019t a terrible thing I guess but I wouldn\u2019t wanna be ya.  And thanks, you as well \ud83d\ude01.  I love people like you and I, where \nI can just be like hey you know what I love you but stfu please..  And they are like this with me.  Hope y\u2019all enjoy your holidays I\u2019m out for the night."]}
