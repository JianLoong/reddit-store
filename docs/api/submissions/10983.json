But it's **your** illness. Yes, you should be afforded some grace and accommodations where applicable. But you also need coping mechanisms of your own as the world won't always bend for you. If you wanted an equal number you should have talked to your fiance before you started choosing. Now you're putting your fiance in the awkward position of potentially taking away a bridesmaid spot from a friend, which to many is a big deal.\n\nEdited out soft because, well, reading your replies you aren't even trying to manage your OCD. You can't expect others to help you if you do nothing to help yourself", "YTA - it\u2019s very rude to drop someone as a bridesmaid after already asking them. It\u2019s on you to find another groomsmen - hell, ask literally any male family member or friend or coworker - since you are the one so bothered by the 5:6 ratio. You say that your fianc\u00e9e is being unreasonable and refusing to see your side, but really that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing.", "YTA. As someone with severe OCD and takes heavy medication just to function, I empathize with your struggle. But it's YOUR struggle and you need to find better ways to cope with it. \n\nI don't make other people change to deal with my contamination/germ issues; I've developed tools and habits to help me. If your OCD is so bad that you truly believe your wedding will be ruined over this then you need to seek medical treatment.", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry you are being unreasonable. You wait untill 6 weeks till the wedding to then say you have an issue that you knew you'd have a problem with. Now you asking her to demote someone who has already been part of the wedding party and did all the stuff associated with it. I'm sorry but your going to need to deal with it somehow as it isn't fair to your fiancee and her friend", "YTA. If you can't work through this on your own or with help of a therapist, you are not ready to be married. There will be greater and more significant challenges in the future.", "YTA I have OCD (actually diagnosed by a medical professional) and while I completely relate to the stress and anxiety that certain things being uneven or unbalanced can cause, and believe me it can cause, it\u2019s not an excuse to do things like this. One of the things I\u2019ve had to learn over the years is how to manage my OCD when it comes to stuff like this. Your partner should definitely try and help you, but not like that. An example for me is how many cubes of ice goes into a cup depending on cup size and what drink I\u2019m having, my partner knows this and if he gets me water for example, he\u2019ll put in the number of ice cubes that feels right to me. When we get married even though it will make me uncomfortable because of my OCD and need for balance, I\u2019ll have to accept it if we have different amounts of bridesmaids and groomsmen. I know it\u2019s tough to deal with OCD, but it\u2019s not an excuse. You aren\u2019t a kid anymore, you\u2019re about to be someone\u2019s husband. Act like it.", "YTA - pretty sure you can hire someone to fill the role for the day, like filler people who work on movie sets for the day.", "I don\u2019t have OCD, but I do get freaked out from clusters. I nearly had a panic attack from watching Doctor Strange and had to scream at the person I was with to turn it off (not aggressively, I was just too scared out to move to grab the remote). I understand how different stimulations can evoke panic. I\u2019d say neither of you are in the wrong, but try stressing how important this is to you. She might still not get it, so maybe find another groomsman. If it would work, maybe the ring barer could be a boy to balance the gender numbers. This day is as important for you as it is for her. You deserve to be comfortable, so keep talking to her until you\u2019ve reached a compromise.", "Coming from someone with absolutely crippling OCD especially with numbers and symmetry, I 100% get it, but still a soft YTA for how much this puts your fianc\u00e9e out.\n\nHow far out is the wedding and do you have the funds for therapy? I have made unbelievable strides with my therapist and she's all video calls so it doesn't matter where you're located. It sounds like you and I have a similar type of OCD so I'd be happy to give her your info. She's the only person I've found success with.\n\nUnfortunately, exposure is really the only solution and avoidance only makes things worse. ERP sucks at first, but I went from not being able to leave my house to being virtually ocd free in literally months. I know how hard it is, and my wedding had similar rules. If I could go back in time I would've worked with my therapist so much sooner to avoid the added stress. Please take me up on it because I promise you the money you'd put towards this therapist is worth more for you and your future wife than any aspect of the wedding. Good luck either way!\n\nEDIT: There are also places you can hire a groomsman for situations like this. It might feel a little weird, but it's a way better option than making your fianc\u00e9e drop a good friend.", "YTA. Why didn't you both discuss the wedding party BEFORE asking people? Then this all could have been avoided. Sounds like you and your fiance need to work on communication instead of rushing to plan something without the other's input.", "YTA. It's your job to make sure your OCD is not impacting other people's lives. I have OCD and sure, sometimes I request people to make very minor modifications to their behavior to accommodate (e.g. if my partner smacks my butt on one side, I ask that they smack it again on the other side lol; and when we're cooking together, I do tasks that don't involve handling raw meat). But this is not a *minor* accommodation. Dropping a bridesmaid is a HUGE deal, no matter how close they are, and it's absolutely unfair and-- yes-- controlling and alienating to ask for her to do it.\n\nIf you can't get your condition under control by the time of the wedding, I'd suggest just tricking your brain into being comfortable. For example, women are generally smaller than men, so just assume that the total mass of 6 bridesmaids is roughly equivalent to 5 groomsmen. There, now it's balanced, and it would be *un*balanced if she dropped a bridesmaid.\n\nIn the meantime, [here's a site with some good self-help resources for OCD.](https://anxieties.com/self-help-resources/ocd/) It's run by the doctor who helped me with my own OCD so I can vouch for it. \n\nYou absolutely need to work on getting your OCD under control because there will be lots of situations in the future where you'll need to be able to handle things for the sake of fairness in your relationship. If/when you have kids, are you going to have germ fears that make it hard for you to change diapers? Kids are notoriously bad at conforming to people's standards of cleanliness and symmetry in general. Are you going to end up being controlling of your future wife because of your desire to calm your anxieties? What happens if she gets an injury to one side of her body and ends up asymmetrical? What happens if YOU end up asymmetrical? Asymmetry is a reality of life.", "YTA. If you can't manage your OCD over something that you were aware of before the wedding, how will you manage if heaven forbid a mishap happens at the wedding itself? Big events almost always never go as planned.", "YTA.  Gonna have to figure out another plan there. I cannot imagine you asked your fiance to drop someone from the wedding party she already asked to be in. I mean dude think about that. That is not a reasonable ask from you.", "YTA. If your symptoms are this bad you need therapy and better medications.", "YTA it is just as much her wedding as it is your's.", "YTA - Go get treatment for your OCD if it is this bad or talk to whoever is treating you to up/change medication. You can't control this on the wedding day you fiance has every right to have the number and specifically who she wants..", "YTA. Your request is NOT a reasonable way for her to accommodate YOUR issue. You want her to damage a relationship with one of her friends so YOU can feel better about the even number? Also, it\u2019s not your place to determine how close/not close she is to one of her friends- if she asked them to be a bridesmaid, it\u2019s for a reason. Serious YTA.", "Some of the comments in this thread are mean and ableist and I want you to know I don't stand with those people and I sympathize.

This level of ocd is not manageable for quality of life.", "YTA and I think it's obvious why you can't find any friend to be your extra groomsman.

It is not fair to ask your fiancee to drop one of her bridesmaids just because you want to have an even number of groomsmen and bridesmaids. Your OCD is not an excuse to control your fiancee or dictate who she can have in her wedding party. It is important to respect your partner's relationships and friendships, and asking her to choose between you and one of her friends is unfair and unreasonable. Additionally, it is not fair to expect your fiancee to prioritize your comfort over her own and the comfort of her friends.

Your fiance wants these 6 women as her bridesmaids. \n\nSince she's not open to kicking one of her friends out of the wedding party (which isn't unreasonable) and you don't want to be anxious/stressed for the entirety of the wedding (also understandable), just find someone you're comfortable being your groomsman or have her pick someone to be her groomsman.", "Then I suggest you get socialising. At least try to find another groomsman.", "I really want to know what she was expecting? Like an all out gladiator brawl or the women showering her in praise and promising their first born son to her?", "Good grief. She sounds nauseating! Glad those 5 ladies refused to be bridesmaids!", "You're incorrect on that one. All of my friends have reacted to stressor like the other people with OCD in this thread -- which is to say, they manage themselves  or remove themselves from situations when their triggers get too bad for them to function, consult their treatment plans, use self-soothing techniques when they can't leave, and always, always, always have been upfront and honest when communicating about what they can and can't handle. You know, like the rest of us with debilitating mental health issues.", "Well,  I am diagnosed OCD, and I agree OP is TA.  He's doing absolutely nothing to treat it and expecting everyone else to just deal with his issues.  There comes a point where you have to take some kind, any kind, of steps to keep the OCD from controlling you. \n\nI understand not everyone can afford therapy or meds. But there are a million workbooks, videos, etc out there that can give you tools to help OCD. OP just wants everyone else to deal with his illness, but is taking no responsibility for it himself.   That's not victim blaming.  That's called learning personal responsibility.", "a condition that OP can control their actions towards. i actually have severe OCD and literally the first thing they teach you in therapy is how not to let OCD control those around you BECAUSE YOU CAN\u2019T. if this is a problem for OP, therapy should start yesterday. this is literally the whole point of therapy, to get professional support. using OCD as an excuse to control others is NOT OKAY. ITS NOT OKAY. and that\u2019s what OP is doing here. if fianc\u00e9e had been okay with it this would be a different story. it sounds like the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back here, just little things here and there that OP needs to control just built up", "How is it victim blaming when it\u2019s his fault? He created this situation by agreeing to it months ago and trying to flip the script now. He knows he will cause a lot of damage to a relationship, but he cares more about how something looks than 2 peoples feelings, money, and time. \n\nHe isn\u2019t the victim. His mental illness is not an excuse to be selfish and control his fianc\u00e9. He needs to seek help for it.", "The logical solution is for OP to ask a cousin or other male guest. But he doesn\u2019t want someone he doesn\u2019t know standing up beside him and thinks it\u2019s okay for his GF to deeply hurt one of her close friends.", "If the bride blew up at OP the way he\u2019s implying, I have to imagine this is a habit. He uses his condition constantly as an excuse to get his way without actively seeking treatment, and this was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\n\nOP, always remember\u2026..your mental illness is not your fault, but it is your responsibility.", "And that the groom refused to be a groom...", "You're still trying to compare apples to oranges because you're caught up in your own personal issues.\nMental and emotional health are a life long commitment far exceeding how long any marriage will last nowadays, and you're comparing that against the vanity of being seen in a position for a ceremony that last only a few hours in the most extreme circumstances.\nIt's no comparison."]}
