But it's **your** illness. Yes, you should be afforded some grace and accommodations where applicable. But you also need coping mechanisms of your own as the world won't always bend for you. If you wanted an equal number you should have talked to your fiance before you started choosing. Now you're putting your fiance in the awkward position of potentially taking away a bridesmaid spot from a friend, which to many is a big deal.\n\nEdited out soft because, well, reading your replies you aren't even trying to manage your OCD. You can't expect others to help you if you do nothing to help yourself", "YTA - it\u2019s very rude to drop someone as a bridesmaid after already asking them. It\u2019s on you to find another groomsmen - hell, ask literally any male family member or friend or coworker - since you are the one so bothered by the 5:6 ratio. You say that your fianc\u00e9e is being unreasonable and refusing to see your side, but really that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing.", "YTA. As someone with severe OCD and takes heavy medication just to function, I empathize with your struggle. But it's YOUR struggle and you need to find better ways to cope with it. \n\nI don't make other people change to deal with my contamination/germ issues; I've developed tools and habits to help me. If your OCD is so bad that you truly believe your wedding will be ruined over this then you need to seek medical treatment.", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry you are being unreasonable. You wait untill 6 weeks till the wedding to then say you have an issue that you knew you'd have a problem with. Now you asking her to demote someone who has already been part of the wedding party and did all the stuff associated with it. I'm sorry but your going to need to deal with it somehow as it isn't fair to your fiancee and her friend", "YTA. If you can't work through this on your own or with help of a therapist, you are not ready to be married. There will be greater and more significant challenges in the future.", "YTA I have OCD (actually diagnosed by a medical professional) and while I completely relate to the stress and anxiety that certain things being uneven or unbalanced can cause, and believe me it can cause, it\u2019s not an excuse to do things like this. One of the things I\u2019ve had to learn over the years is how to manage my OCD when it comes to stuff like this. Your partner should definitely try and help you, but not like that. An example for me is how many cubes of ice goes into a cup depending on cup size and what drink I\u2019m having, my partner knows this and if he gets me water for example, he\u2019ll put in the number of ice cubes that feels right to me. When we get married even though it will make me uncomfortable because of my OCD and need for balance, I\u2019ll have to accept it if we have different amounts of bridesmaids and groomsmen. I know it\u2019s tough to deal with OCD, but it\u2019s not an excuse. You aren\u2019t a kid anymore, you\u2019re about to be someone\u2019s husband. Act like it.", "YTA - pretty sure you can hire someone to fill the role for the day, like filler people who work on movie sets for the day.", "I don\u2019t have OCD, but I do get freaked out from clusters. I nearly had a panic attack from watching Doctor Strange and had to scream at the person I was with to turn it off (not aggressively, I was just too scared out to move to grab the remote). I understand how different stimulations can evoke panic. I\u2019d say neither of you are in the wrong, but try stressing how important this is to you. She might still not get it, so maybe find another groomsman. If it would work, maybe the ring barer could be a boy to balance the gender numbers. This day is as important for you as it is for her. You deserve to be comfortable, so keep talking to her until you\u2019ve reached a compromise.", "Coming from someone with absolutely crippling OCD especially with numbers and symmetry, I 100% get it, but still a soft YTA for how much this puts your fianc\u00e9e out.\n\nHow far out is the wedding and do you have the funds for therapy? I have made unbelievable strides with my therapist and she's all video calls so it doesn't matter where you're located. It sounds like you and I have a similar type of OCD so I'd be happy to give her your info. She's the only person I've found success with.\n\nUnfortunately, exposure is really the only solution and avoidance only makes things worse. ERP sucks at first, but I went from not being able to leave my house to being virtually ocd free in literally months. I know how hard it is, and my wedding had similar rules. If I could go back in time I would've worked with my therapist so much sooner to avoid the added stress. Please take me up on it because I promise you the money you'd put towards this therapist is worth more for you and your future wife than any aspect of the wedding. Good luck either way!\n\nEDIT: There are also places you can hire a groomsman for situations like this. It might feel a little weird, but it's a way better option than making your fianc\u00e9e drop a good friend.", "YTA. Why didn't you both discuss the wedding party BEFORE asking people? Then this all could have been avoided. Sounds like you and your fiance need to work on communication instead of rushing to plan something without the other's input.", "YTA. It's your job to make sure your OCD is not impacting other people's lives. I have OCD and sure, sometimes I request people to make very minor modifications to their behavior to accommodate (e.g. if my partner smacks my butt on one side, I ask that they smack it again on the other side lol; and when we're cooking together, I do tasks that don't involve handling raw meat). But this is not a *minor* accommodation. Dropping a bridesmaid is a HUGE deal, no matter how close they are, and it's absolutely unfair and-- yes-- controlling and alienating to ask for her to do it.\n\nIf you can't get your condition under control by the time of the wedding, I'd suggest just tricking your brain into being comfortable. For example, women are generally smaller than men, so just assume that the total mass of 6 bridesmaids is roughly equivalent to 5 groomsmen. There, now it's balanced, and it would be *un*balanced if she dropped a bridesmaid.\n\nIn the meantime, [here's a site with some good self-help resources for OCD.](https://anxieties.com/self-help-resources/ocd/) It's run by the doctor who helped me with my own OCD so I can vouch for it. \n\nYou absolutely need to work on getting your OCD under control because there will be lots of situations in the future where you'll need to be able to handle things for the sake of fairness in your relationship. If/when you have kids, are you going to have germ fears that make it hard for you to change diapers? Kids are notoriously bad at conforming to people's standards of cleanliness and symmetry in general. Are you going to end up being controlling of your future wife because of your desire to calm your anxieties? What happens if she gets an injury to one side of her body and ends up asymmetrical? What happens if YOU end up asymmetrical? Asymmetry is a reality of life.", "YTA. If you can't manage your OCD over something that you were aware of before the wedding, how will you manage if heaven forbid a mishap happens at the wedding itself? Big events almost always never go as planned.", "YTA.  Gonna have to figure out another plan there. I cannot imagine you asked your fiance to drop someone from the wedding party she already asked to be in. I mean dude think about that. That is not a reasonable ask from you.", "YTA. If your symptoms are this bad you need therapy and better medications.", "YTA it is just as much her wedding as it is your's.", "YTA - Go get treatment for your OCD if it is this bad or talk to whoever is treating you to up/change medication. You can't control this on the wedding day you fiance has every right to have the number and specifically who she wants..", "YTA. Your request is NOT a reasonable way for her to accommodate YOUR issue. You want her to damage a relationship with one of her friends so YOU can feel better about the even number? Also, it\u2019s not your place to determine how close/not close she is to one of her friends- if she asked them to be a bridesmaid, it\u2019s for a reason. Serious YTA.", "Some of the comments in this thread are mean and ableist and I want you to know I don't stand with those people and I sympathize.

This level of ocd is not manageable for quality of life.", "YTA and I think it's obvious why you can't find any friend to be your extra groomsman.

It is not fair to ask your fiancee to drop one of her bridesmaids just because you want to have an even number of groomsmen and bridesmaids. Your OCD is not an excuse to control your fiancee or dictate who she can have in her wedding party. It is important to respect your partner's relationships and friendships, and asking her to choose between you and one of her friends is unfair and unreasonable.

That way you have an even number and don't have to worry about it.\n\nAnd, if your fiance can't accommodate you for your wedding, are you sure she is someone want to spend the rest of your life with?", "YTA- I also have diagnosed OCD. It is no excuse to treat your partner poorly and be defensive when she tells you where to shove it. It is up to you to face your problems and triggers head on, and it is up to you to manage your emotions. This will not be the only time something like this will happen.", "YTA", "YTA.  It is your job to manage your mental health challenges, not hurt your wife and her friend by demanding someone drop out.  If you can't do this, maybe you're not ready for marriage.  I am guessing your fiancee makes concessions for you constantly but this affects more than her.\n\nThe bridesmaids can just walk up the aisle alone, they never NEED to be paired anyway.  Now that you mention it my husband and I had asymetrical sides in our wedding.  It is fine.", "Why you do not ask her to help you find someone for your groomsmen? YTA", "YTA", "YTA\n\nYour OCD is your problem.", "Un-bridesmaid-ing a friend would be a friendship ending thing to do. YTA. You need to rustle up another male relative if you need to fix the numbers. And you should have dis used this first cause now you have a weird situation on your hands.", "YTA.", "YTA easily", "YTA; why cant you add another groomsman if its just about making it equal?", "YTA. You obviously sound like a HUGE groomzilla.", "Stupid shit like this is why I\u2019m so glad we didn\u2019t hand bridesmaids or groomsmen at my wedding.", "YTA, where were you when this was being planned? Where were you when people were being asked? You don't get to have an opinion about this after people have been asked, dresses bought and invites finalized. This is controlling because if you really cared this would have been a long time ago discussion.", "You are not ready to be married to anyone. I hope your fianc\u00e9e see this red flag you are waving and stop in time. It is better to cancel a wedding than she have to divorce you after, because I know you wouldn't make it easier for her. YTA.", "YTA.  Rocky start there. Maybe hold off and sort yourselves out. Can\u2019t possibly be more problems lying in wait for you two.", "YTA. I have OCD. Really severe OCD. Have you been formally diagnosed?  Even if you have been formally diagnosed that doesn't give you the excuse to screw with people. You don't get to control people's decisions and lives.", "YTA. Either treat your OCD so you can learn to cope and have a healthy marriage (which is all about compromise/working together to find a solution that suits both parties) OR don't get married. If you can't understand and then act on that understanding of this situation do not get married. You need to make the utmost effort to get why what you're asking your fiance is unreasonable.", "YTA. I do hope you are getting treatment for your OCD.  Work with a therapist who can help your cope with the uneven numbers and not let it derail your wedding day.", "YTA - get a random cousin from either side to be a groomsman if you\u2019re so fixated on having even numbers. You don\u2019t attempt to force your fianc\u00e9 to dismiss a bridesmaid whom she has already established and the bridesmaid has definitely already invested in the wedding. This isn\u2019t about your OCD, it\u2019s about you not making any effort and putting your fianc\u00e9 in a really shitty situation", "YTA - OP your mental health issue is not to be used to control your partner.\n\nIf it bothers you so much go and get yourself a 6th groomsman. Then you will be even stevens and you can the stfu about it without pissing off your SO.", "NTA - you should both be comfortable at your wedding\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if my boyfriend asked for both parties to be equal then I wouldn\u2019t have an issue with it, tbh I\u2019d probs prefer that too haha", "DOES she have a brother or cousin? I asked my husbands cousin I never met. She graciously said yes. We had even numbers. She was so sweet. Or a good guy friend of your fianc\u00e9e? YTA", "NTA - the person you\u2019re marrying is your teammate so you solve problems together. And this is clearly a problem. So what\u2019s the easiest way to fix the problem? It sounds like her dropping a bridesmaid. I\u2019m assuming if you could simply put a lid on your OCD you would. \n\nPeople here don\u2019t understand how uncomfortable OCD can be. Sometimes it can be extremely anxiety provoking. And YES, people with OCD are aware that it\u2019s not logical. We\u2019re not stupid. But it\u2019s a legit mental disorder.\n\nDon\u2019t listen to the other commenters here OP. Talk it out with your girlfriend and make her understand that this is a serious issue that you don\u2019t think you can fix yourself (unless you can of course, but it sounds like you have pretty bad OCD).", "INFO: Is there anyone from your fiancee's side who can step up to be a groomsman, like a brother, friend, cousin, uncle etc? I get wanting things to be even, just from an aesthetic or practical stand point, but there's another solution yall can consider here.", "Woooooahhhh YTA!", "Holy shoot YTA.\nI understand that OCD is a real and valid condition and I understand in your perfect world, the numbers would be even.\n\nHaving said that, you\u2019re apparently able to function well enough to be getting married at all, so I would intensely assume you have the ability to accommodate using whatever mental coping mechanisms you have developed. It won\u2019t be your preference but it should something you can handle for your fianc\u00e9.\n\nIf you actually cannot. Either get an extra groomsman or confess to your fianc\u00e9 that your OCD is out of control and you need serious therapy and development of coping mechanisms before you\u2019re ready to marry anyone.", "You are responsible for treatment of your OCD. Not your fiance. YTA and if, if this marriage happens you better get help because marriage is a long and tough road. You trying to use your OCD as a manipulator is wrong and glad she's putting her foot down now so you realize it's not going to used against her.", "YTA\n\nyou suggested that you'd be the one to tell the bridesmaid though right? because it's a you problem", "Dude, I\u2019ll be your sixth.", "YTA. My parents had an uneven number of bridesmaids and groomsmen and they didn't care but everyone else did so they wound up including the guy my aunt was dating at the time- so now they have some random guy they didn't really even know in their wedding photos. An uneven number doesn't matter.", "op=YTA\n\nYour OCD is your responsibility to manage.  \n\nAnd you don't get to decide how \"close\" she is to her bridesmaids.", "Does the OP not know any Male family members on the fianc\u00e9e's side or partners of her friends who could step in? I find it hard to believe there isn't a single male person he knows \"a little bit\" who'd be willing to step in for the day.", "Seriously, pick the bridesmaid most likely to be a long term friend and ask if her SO will be a groomsman. In all likelihood they will know each other at least a little. If that person is already a groomsman go down the line until you find a bridesmaid who's plus one isn't already in the bridal party. Could be a bridesmaids brother or cousin if the bride doesn't have any brothers or cousins to help out. Maybe a distant relative of the groom can step up. There's a lot of ways to solve this that don't involve torpedoing the bride's friendships and could lead to more friends for the groom as well.\n\nAdditionally if he can't handle the discomfort of an unbalanced wedding party he may not have the emotional maturity to handle all the really difficult things about marriage.", "This is so fucking wrong and ignorant it\u2019s sad. What if OP was in a wheelchair and due to limited space there could only be 5 bridesmaids? You\u2019d sound like the biggest asshole saying \u201cpeople can\u2019t manage your condition that\u2019s on you.\u201d Well, coming from someone who has actually had experience with OCD, I can tell you it\u2019s no different than any other disability and it\u2019s not always as easy as simple \u201cgetting help.\u201d OCD can be straight up debilitating for some people. Seriously, before you minimize someone\u2019s disability you should learn a bit about it.", "I seriously doubt he'll ever be back here to get brutally hen pecked again. Some of these women think it's okay to cuss him up one side down the other, smh.", "Sounds like you have mild OCD. Imagine having OCD at a level that caused debilitating anxiety? We don\u2019t really know the severity of OP\u2019s issue.", "As a fellow diagnosed OCD- OP NEEDS to get over it. And yes, that means by dealing with it head on, sitting with the discomfort, and eventually.... Getting over it. It's not easy and it doesn't feel good at the time, but this can be a first step in managing OCD symptoms. Like a self-managed ERP almost.", "Hen pecked is a sexist term. But yes.", "Maybe he should ask one of the groomsmen he trusts the most to bring in one of his closest friends, one he thinks would blend.\n\nOP might get a new friend out of it.", "Yeh, or a cousin or an uncle to \u201crepresent their family\u201d\n\nOr invite one of OP\u2019s brothers, cousins or uncles to show you\u2019re joining their family.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard.", "Sounds about right. OCD isn't s personality trait or some cute quirk. It's a legit illness and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. \n\nI'm a contamination OCDer and I've done it all--washed my hands til they bled, washed my clothes multiple times,  washed my mouth with peroxide til pieces of it sloughed off, sprayed my hair with lysol, all of it.\n\n Hell I would even consider myself pretty well adjusted and highly functioning NOW, after half a lifetime with OCD, but I just moved to a new house and it's a million times harder with OCD. Clean the floor! Clean the sink! Oh, I can't use the washing machine or the dishwasher until I CLEAN THEM. I literally have been living out of a suitcase for a week because I couldn't hang my clothes in the closet until I mopped it and wiped down the shelves with bleach.  Ugh.", "Seriously, I\u2019ve gotta get myself in to see a therapist.
