I want to put this amount towards future of my daughter. I am worried I won't have anything more than this to gift her at the time of wedding. \n\nMy wife on the other hand thinks we should use this money to travel the world. Or travel as much as this money lasts for. \n\nBut I stood firm in my decision and put this money as fixed deposit in daughter's name. Wife is mad about this. \n\nAITA?\n\nFrom comments : \n\nMy wife is my daughter's mother. \n\nWe both used to work. She is still working cause she is younger and has more service years. I have monthly pension and she will receive it too on retirement. We can live off our pensions. \n\nThe money is only around 25000 dollars. It is primarily for my daughter's wedding. It is customary I hold a big wedding and give her gold. I wanted to buy it now itself. But my daughter has made it clear she won't take any gold and hence I have put the money in FD. She may use it as she pleases and it will be our gift for her future. For whatever she uses it for, marriage or house. \n\nThough my wife works, I take care of all household expenses. I used up all my earnings, savings and gratuity from previous job for construction of our house, it's remodels and repairs. All major purchases are funded by me. So is our daughter's education. \n\nMy wife take care of her personal expenses and gives allowances to our daughter. She used to work in a different city and had to pay her expenses , and while our daughter was studying in a different city, gave her allowance. I still helped her out too and also paid for all my daughter's clothing and other major expenses. Only major thing my wife has ever contributed to in our household is paying loan for our car, of which again, I have paid 50% cost as downpayment. \n\nMostly, my wife pays her dad a small amount, buys clothes and gifts and snacks, take our daughter out for fun stuff etc. Basically, most of her income now is spent on fun money for what she chooses and nothing on household expenses. \n\nWe have worked hard most of our lives and have taken around 3 long vacations in last 20 years. We go on smaller trips together though. Almost all trips and major parts of vacations are funded by me.", "created_utc": 1692993709, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1619j3z/aita_for_putting_money_towards_daughters_wedding/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can take lumpsum out of pension, for emergencies. We still have house property and  other properties in case we need to sell or mortgage any for funds.\n\nIf she helps, all this will be hers one day. If she doesn't, we can use these to pay off any necessary expenses.", "My daughter is not greedy. She will be happy with whatever I give her. Or if I give her nothing. \n\nBut it's my responsibility to help her. To give her a head start in life. I'd rather see her well than travel. \n\nMy wife on retirement will get her own gratuity. She is free to do whatever she pleases with it.", "Am I the only terrible spouse? I don't understand. I don't want to travel, yet i fund and travel to appease her. And yet I am the bad guy? \n\nNot to mention she too had a long career and didn't have to contribute to bills. She blew away her money while I managed all the household expenses myself. She will get gratuity too. And I am sure she won't give anything to our daughter.  \n\nIf I am the only parent trying to give my daughter a head start, which my wife had got from her father too, why am I the bad guy?", "Your daughter is not your possession, and does not owe you assistance in your old age. Perhaps you are unaware of the impact of caregiving on the children of parents who don't make sufficient arrangements for that, but it isn't something one would willingly do to a loved one.\n\nIf you are so well off and all your arrangements made, why would you force your wife to choose between travel and your daughter's wedding? Is there no way you can manage both?", "\n\nYou sound more like room mates than husband and wife. \n\nOh to be a fly on that wall.\nI hope you don\u2019t accept or ask your wife for anything involving her gratuity when it happens. \nThat would be an awkward ending to this.", "What about your responsibility to your wife? Or do you assume you have none? Seems like you don\u2019t even like your wife.", "Properties I hold are ancestral. I am talking over 4 generations.  It is important to us not to lose it. Unless it is a true emergency, we would not sell it. \n\nTravel and vacation isn't an emergency. It's a luxury. Wedding, without the funds would constitute an emergency. Culturally. Will my daughter handle her wedding herself? Absolutely. But it will be against our culture and I will be deeply shamed. \n\nFurther, my wife, seemingly against the saving for daughter, has received gold from her father as well. She has received it and doesn't want to give forward. \n\nTo me, my daughter comes above vacations. Her future is more important. Choosing that won't leave my wife bereft. If I pass away, she will have my life insurance and part of all properties I hold. (Legally my daughter has equal share too). \n\nMy wife is independent woman who has her own income and will get her own gratuity bonus. She can use her money however she wants. Travel world with her friends. I choose my daughter's welfare over fun. That's it.", "No I wouldn't.", "I have paid all bills so far. I have taken full care of her financially. I have funded most of our vacations already. \n\nShe is a grown woman with her own job and income. She can pay for her own vacation.", "What if you didn't have to be deeply shamed at all, much less by some understandable modifications to traditions based on sensitivity to your wife's and daughter's preferences? Why not ask your wife to pick the one place that'd be most intriguing to her and take a trip there?", "What does she pay for with her income? Your relationship with your wife sounds confusing as fuck.\n\nYou have wayyy bigger issues than what you do with your retirement bonus.", "It's easy for a internet stranger to say. But to someone who has to live out life in the same town, face the same people, hear all the comments, especially at all future weddings... It's not easy.", "I know it sounds confusing but it's norm here. Husband's provide. In my/our house, i take care of all bills and purchases. Irrespective of what she makes. When she works out of town, she takes care of her own expenses. But when she runs low, i help out. And I take care of our daughter financially too. Wife gives her allowances to cover living costs, i cover major expenses and education. \n\nMy wife mostly spents what surplus she has on clothes for herself and daughter. Buys gifts. Treats everyone. She basically has fun with her surplus amount.", "NTA. It's your bonus, from the money you made. You fund mostly everything in regards to bills/your household. You haven't had the chance to set aside the money that culturally, it's important to give your daughter, and now you have a chance to do so and you did. You've paid for three major vacations and numerous smaller trips for you and your wife, so neither you nor she is lacking in vacations. She also makes her own money, which she uses on her own expenses, an she does not contribute any of her money to the expenses you pay. She will  be getting a bonus of her own in the future, which she will be free to use as she sees fit. $25,000 is truthfully a pittance in this day and age, and it will make a fair investment in your daughter's future. Considering how little your wife contributes, I don't see how it is unfair to her to do what you see fit with the money. It's not like you're taking money away from your wife and leaving her high and dry. She simply saw an opportunity for extra money and is angry she can't use it how she wants.", "NTA. It's YOUR money. YOU pay for most/all household expenses. YOU pay the majority of the cost of the vacations. While I would normally say someone should compromise in this situation, your wife seems unwilling to do so at any level. If you would rather use that money for your daughter, do it. If your wife is willing to compromise some--say use some for a vacation while putting some aside for your daughter--I'd do that. But, if you don't, you're still not TAH.", "It's your money, you can use it for whatever you see fit to use it for.  Your wife will probably be mad whatever you decide though.  NTAH.", "NTA. It\u2019s YOUR retirement money \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nIf your wife wants to use HER retirement money for a vacation when the time comes, then she can choose to do that. But this money is YOURS\n\nConsidering (based on what I\u2019ve gathered from the description), you pay the majority of expenses and it\u2019s clearly not 50/50, so why all of a sudden are the commenters expecting you to go 50/50 on this decision when it\u2019s literally your money?", "NTA because I believe the underlining cultural context matters. Its sounds like your family is not a part of westernized culture and at least you are someone who values tradition. Id also like to believe that after this many years of marriage your wife likely wasn't surprised by your choice and the anger may actually be at herself because she made plans for the money in her head.", "Not NEARLY as much as he likes his daughter. Paid for her education, expenses in another city, personal expenses, major expenses, clothing, and now a big wedding complete with gold she doesn't want.", "Uhhhh kinda wondering why your wife gets to try and dictate how you use this money when you\u2019ve practically funded her entire life???? If she\u2019s literally only paid for herself and half her car\u2026 does she have savings she can spend on traveling for you two? Why is this vacation dependent on your money?", "Personally I would take 5k for a vacation and give 20 to daughter after the wedding so it doesn\u2019t get blown on the party. But you do you", "The big problem is you don\u2019t want to be with your wife. Why be married?  You are living separate lives.", "A wedding party that uses up 25k? I mean that doesn\u2019t sound as if it will really help her in anyway in terms of her future? What about a down payment on a house?"]}
