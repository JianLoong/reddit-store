If you were truly curious you wouldn't have started with a dirty look and wishing she'd bow her head.  I thought lying wasn't OK for your religion. Nor judging others.", "YTA. Intrusive and obnoxious.\n\nI\u2019m also an atheist - no one cares about your approval. You\u2019re a literal child.", "Sorry kid, but YTA.\n\nYou are taking your beliefs and trying to force it on others around you. If your aunt does not believe in Christianity, then you should respect her right. If she doesn't want to bow her head in prayer she doesn't have to do so. You are the one who is being disrespectful of someone else's beliefs. Just as you don't approve of her beliefs, she does not have to approve of yours. You are being close minded and I feel like you don't understand how YTA in this situation. But then again, most headstrong religious folk are the AH. Educate yourself on life outside of your Christian bubble. Everyone deserves the right to worship who, or how they wish. Hopefully as you get older you'll learn to respect others.", "YTA. You said, \"wish she was a Christian like us.\"  Be real bro, you weren't just curious, You were trying to witness to her. She has a right to her beliefs. She doesn't need to explain herself.", "YTA, you\u2019re 13, you shouldn\u2019t be judging peoples world views when you just started seeing the world and making opinions for yourself, your aunt did nothing wrong and you interrogated her and made extremely rude comments, you should apologize to her", "YTA\n\nSaying \"God died for your sins\" and that you and everyone else finds her atheism odd isn't a curious question.  It's a snotty thing you did.\n\nThere's a hell of a lot more people in the world that aren't Christian than are.  You aren't part of the big club or the right club.  You are part of your own club and nothing more.\n\nInstead of concerning yourself with your curiosity with the religious or non-religious beliefs of others, you should find some curiosity for tolerance.", "YTA.\n\nI could ask you the question, \"Why are you a Christian?\" and the simple fact is you're a Christian because that's what your parents told you to be.  I'm not going to disparage any religion on here, but there is nobody who actually knows \"the right answer\", but the world is full of people who think they do.\n\nIf you want to grow as a person, tell your aunt, \"I'm really sorry I made you uncomfortable.  If you feel like it, I would appreciate understanding what drove your beliefs.\"\n\nBut be careful - she might change your opinions.  And don't use that as an excuse to preach.  Actually listen.", "It's absolutely OK to be interested in other peoples beliefs but you must be respectful of them. \n\nYou weren't. \n\nYour aunt was respectful, and sat quietly, while your family prayed and you rudely glared at her then aggressively questioned her because her ideology is different to yours.\n\nYour belief system isn't better than hers. It's just different.", "YTA. But you're a kid. And God didn't die for our sins, his son did. \n\nAnyway, religion is a hot topic especially since so much hate, pain and death is caused by people in the name of God. \n\nYour aunt just wanted to spend time with her family, and if you cannot spend time with her without judging her for not having the same faith as you and everyone else, that is disgusting. And it's in a way abuse, you get upset because you seem to think faith is what is needed in order to be accepted into 'heaven'. If God really exist, I doubt ge cares if you believe in him or not.\n\nI got friends who believe, but I don't. They respect me, I respect them.", "So, being the good Christian that you are, instead of praying you gave her dirty looks. Sounds about right. You, young grasshopper are a huge AH, hopefully you\u2019ve got time to grow up and see that", "YTA. Someday you\u2019ll grow up and see that your path isn\u2019t the only one and learn to respect others choices. A great, early lesson in minding your own business.", "YTA. It was neither the time nor the place. She was much more polite than you were. No one is required to explain their beliefs to you and you are not ow d that conversation. Next time read the room and ask her about a hobby instead", "YTA. Need to learn take social cues. The \u201dI just have different beliefs from your family, okay hun\u201d? Was the cue to shut up. Asking someones reasoning for belief is typically fine but you also added in a jab of why you think their wrong \"God died for your sins\u201d  which was the 2nd intolerant thing you did. The first was the dirty look.", "YTA, and the worst type of christian, very disrespectful of other people's beliefs while wanting respect given to yours.\n\nOh, and you're 13....LOL. \n\nOh. btw, at 11 I read the bible, cover to cover, critically, like I was reading a novel....that's what made me an atheist.", "Listen kid. I\u2019m an atheist. It wasn\u2019t a decision I made. I was raised Christian and went to church and did bible study. But I never believed in god. Not for lack of trying because believe me I wanted to. So I finally accepted that and now I\u2019m a much happier person and frankly a better person.\nChristianity and belief in god is not the default, and not believing doesn\u2019t make you a bad person. And people like you judging other people for their beliefs is only going to drive them away and make Christians look like shitty people.", "You're young and you lack the empathy and the open mind to understand people who are not like you. So no matter the explanation she would have given you, you would not have understood (\"I just wanted to know why she made this decision\"), you would have just kept badgering her (\"also said \u201dGod died for your sins\u201d and I kind of let her know that I find her atheism odd and so does my whole family too\").\n\nMany expressions in your post show that your questions were less about curiosity and more about condemnation for not being like the rest of the family.\n\nINFO : Have you ever asked yourself why you're a Christian? How come you believe but can't make yourself not believe? How come you so happened to be born in a family with the right religion (had you be born in a Muslim family - for example - you'd be a Muslim, but life did not happen that way for you)? If your aunt stopped being Christian and instead converted to another religion, would it be less weird for you? More acceptable for your family? What does it do to you that your aunt is atheist? Is she less loving towards you?\n\nI'm not comfortable rating you because you're so young. If you were older, I'd say you're A. You're young and you have little understanding of life right now, so I'd rather just have you ask yourself these questions and do a bit of introspection about your own beliefs, about why other people's beliefs matter so much to you and to your family, and about whether or not theistic beliefs make a person a good or bad person.", "Yes, dear, YtA. She was being respectful. You admit to glaring her down. You also admit that your family only tolerates her lack of belief in your God. There are many, many Gods worshipped around the world. You have been taught to believe in just one form since birth, and have been groomed to believe all other ways are wrong. She just believes in one less god than you do. As you get older, hopefully you will learn that there are many, many reasons that people choose to believe differently than you do. And no one, including those indoctrinating you,  knows who is  \"right\". And it really doesn't even matter. Treat others the way you want to be treated. That is the ultimate rule of being human. It's even the \"Golden rule\" in the Christian bible.  Follow that, and you won't go wrong, no matter what you choose to believe or not believe.", "YTA. Christians don\u2019t give dirty looks. You should probably spend more time with your aunt. She sounds smart.", "Sorry, kiddo, but YTA. You're lying when you say you were just curious or you wouldn't have given your Auntie dirty looks for not praying. Questions at an appropriate time are one thing, but you were not doing that. You put her on the spot, then gave her dirty looks for not pretending to believe what you do. You may not even realize that's what you did yet because you're very young still but you were not respectful at all. I practice a different faith than you, would you feel good if I treated you the way you treated your aunt regarding that? I'd bet not. That's a good gauge of if you're being an AH or not, btw.", "Buddy.. your aunt doesn\u2019t need or want your approval. She quietly let your family do your chanting and you then started proselytising over dinner and calling her worldview odd. How would you feel if you were over at her house for dinner and she started asking you questions while you were trying to eat? There\u2019s nothing wrong with being inquisitive but there\u2019s a time and a place and you weren\u2019t just asking questions, you knew what you were doing seeing as you admitted to giving her a dirty look for not taking part in your rituals. You\u2019re still young and you\u2019ll start to see a lot more of the world as you keep growing, don\u2019t sell yourself short by alienating anyone that doesn\u2019t believe in the same man in the sky as you do. YTA", "YTA and a liar too. Pretty much every non-christian has experienced the whole pretending to be curious as a way to proselytize. I even remember being explicitly taught it back when I was a Christian. \n\nIt's pretty obvious and we can see through it. We don't suddenly realize the error of our ways because a christian pretended to be interested. Especially those of us who were raised Christian. Nor are the things that seem obvious to you going to seem that way to her. Once you leave christianity all the assumptions and beliefs lose their self-evident truth. Same way you probably look at Hindu beliefs. The floor falls out beneath them. \n\nYou'll get a lot further in life and get along better with people if you learn to be genuinely curious and interested about what other people think. I'm an atheist but I love talking to Christians or other religious people about their beliefs. It's fascinating the different ways people see the world. If you can't do that then just learn to be quiet.", "Absolutely YTA.", "YTA- and you know it.  She doesnt have to bow her head at all.", "YTA massively. Reverse the situation, would you be ok with your aunt interrogating you about your beliefs when you're trying to enjoy a meal with family.\n\nThere's a time and a place and a level of respect for conversations about religion and beliefs and this wasn't it. It started out poorly with the dirty look and just got worse", "Yes, you are TA. I know you\u2019re a kid but this is a valuable lesson to learn. Not everyone holds the same beliefs as you. And speaking as someone who\u2019s old enough to be your mother, believe this: you\u2019ll learn that fact even more the older you get, and there will be people who won\u2019t be as nice the next time you pester them about it. You need to learn how to mind your business, and now is as good a time as any to do it.", "YTA.......you know why you're a Christian? Because you're 13 years old and your parents are.  If your parents were Buddhists, you'd be a Buddhist, etc, etc.......You are ignorant of the world in general, hopefully you'll grow out of it.", "Nobody wants someone proselytizing to them or judging them while they\u2019re trying to eat a damn meal.\n\nYou should get a job selling time shares.\n\nYTA", "She could have answered honestly but it would have been hurtful for you to hear, so she did the mature thing and deflected your questions. \n\nYou were rude and you embarrassed your parents. I know you think you were quite clever but all you did was show your family that your parents didn\u2019t teach you manners. \n\nYou embarrassed your mom. YTA", "Oof take it to r/teenagers buddy. I\u2019d expect that\u2019s where \u201chot takes\u201d from other teens acting like brats can be found. Maybe even sympathized with. YTA", "YTA. \n\nPeople are allowed to believe or not believe as they wish. Maybe your first question about why she is an atheist could be considered genuine curiosity, but she gave you a very polite and respectful answer to pull out of the conversation, and you just kept pushing. That's not curiosity. \n\nShe tried to handle you with grace. You are the one that decided to be pushy, obnoxious, judgmental, rude, and honestly exhausting. \n\nYou're the worst kind of Christian, and the kind that gives the rest of them a bad name.", "YTA. You\u2019re 13, live a little before you start casting stones.", "YTA, big time. It is amazingly arrogant for a 13 year old to be lecturing someone who is 34 about such a personal matter. And I don\u2019t buy your \u201coh, I was just curious.\u201d Since when do dirty looks equal sincere curiosity? Your parents are right to teach you to respect the fact that other people may have different beliefs. You probably just made everyone present uncomfortable, not just your aunt. So don\u2019t just talk about the rituals like bowing your head in prayer: live your supposed religion. Christ exhorted his followers to be kind, tolerant and not to cast the first stone.", "YTA and I wonder what on earth makes you feel justified in judging and harassing women at all. You are 13 and have an enormous amount to learn. Mend your ways while you're still young.", "Shooting her a dirty look and telling her you don\u2019t approve of her beliefs being different from yours? You are absolutely TA. You were disrespectful, rude and judgmental. It is not your place to question her beliefs or judge her for them, by your own beliefs only God has that right...", "Yta. But I don\u2019t really blame you. It\u2019s sort of part of the brainwash where you\u2019re taught you\u2019re better than everyone who doesn\u2019t believe. Giving dirty looks to people who are minding their own business was never polite. You know that. And then by asking questions, you just looked uneducated. Oh well. I used to be this way, too. It\u2019s cringe to think back on how I treated people.", "YTA. Did you miss the part of the bible where it talks about who gets to judge people? Work on yourself and leave your aunt alone.", "OP,  I have read your responses so far. I don't have the clever words to help you see the difference between education and indoctrination. If you think honesty is a Christian value, can you honestly say you were being respectful to your aunt? If you say you were, you deceive yourself,  and the truth is not in you.", "YTA and it's none of your business", "YTA\n\nYour a child, no one needs your approval on what religion they are. She is a 32 grown woman who can make decisions on herself. She chose to be an atheist, and she seems to be happy with her decisions because she has been one for many years. In my opinion, I would mind my own business on others life decisions and start to focus on your own life.", "YTA\n\nYou wonder why so many people hate \"Christians\"?\n\nCause you would make Jesus hang his head in shame.", "Yta. Why are all Christians so judgemental. Aren't you supposed to love everyone?", "Hey man - I am a Christian and I remember being 12/13 and feeling and acting in similar ways. But I was TA then and YTA now, sorry. You gotta consider that your aunt has literally heard all the things you tried to say to her and has 20 years of life beyond your experience to deal with those things. If you could convert people with dirty looks, there would definitely be a lot more Christians out there. \n\nLet me encourage you to check out this passage from 1 Peter in light of this interaction:\n\n1 Peter 3:13-16\n\n[13] Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good? [14] But even if you should suffer for righteousness\u2019 sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, [15] but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect, [16] having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.\n\nDo you think that you showed gentleness and respect to your aunt?", "YTA, everyone has their own beliefs, would you be that way towards anyone else? How would you like it to be questioned and made uncomfortable because of what your belief is? I\u2019m an atheist, and I don\u2019t make a big deal out of it and ask why Christian\u2019s believe in god. Especially at a family dinner.", "YTA. Learning to respect other people\u2019s beliefs (or lack thereof) will greatly enhance the rest of your life.", "YTA. I remember being like you to my older sister when we were teenagers. I was a Christian back then and she was not. Antagonizing her probably made her even more sent in her lack of belief. I was so worried about her getting into heaven I couldn\u2019t see past my own aholery. \n\nI\u2019m no longer a Christian, more agnostic than anything else. My sister never became a Christian and after some time my very religious brother also lost his faith. \n\nI think if you actually read and understood the Bible you would either learn to leave atheists alone or you\u2019ll lose your faith; my brother lost his faith by reading and understanding the Bible.", "You are 13, sit down and keep your beliefs for yourself. Religious freedom includes not having a religion, so your opinions on the matter are null and void. YTA", "YTA and God isn't real. Grow the fuck up.", "YTA\n\nBy the way, why are you a Christian? \n\nWasn't Jesus just some Jewish Zombie?", "YTA-She\u2019s entitled to follow her own path which includes not bowing her head, praying or dealing with her nephew giving her a dirty look, acting as if he speaks for the whole family when he doesn\u2019t or asking questions about her beliefs.", "YTA. You know you weren\u2019t just curious. You were trying to make a point. Telling her G-d died for her sins? People who do not subscribe to that belief literally do not care. We do not give a shot about your thoughts on our beliefs or religion. And telling her that you find her beliefs odd? Guess what? Many of us non-Christians find your beliefs odd.", "YTA from a Catholic.  The second she started getting uncomfortable, you needed to stop. There's a big difference between wanting to understand a different belief system and shaming people for disagreeing with you.\n\nYou're going to have a lot of people in your life who are not Christian.  If you do this to all of them, you're going to be a) isolated in your religious community b) vulnerable to abuse from other Christians and c) punched in the face when you piss off the wrong person.", "Okay. So in this instance, YTA. I get that it was just curiosity but the way you went about asking your questions in that setting was to specifically embarrass your aunt and bring attention to her behaviour that you judge as her \"acting wrongly\".\n\nYou've been brought up to believe one thing and your auntie has grown up with the same teachings but has chosen to walk away from that. You have to respect her beliefs just as your mum said. \n\nYour rude comments and dirty looks are not acceptable because you are not better than your auntie for believing in a higher power. You have no right to call her out on it. \n\nIf you're genuinely curious, talk to her in a private setting. After apologising.", "YTA and organized religion is a crock of shit. Get off your high horse and stop pestering people who aren't as gullible as you", "YTA Do you genuinely think interrogating her in front of your family with different views would influence her positively? Your other comments make it clear that you\u2019re just parroting what you\u2019ve been told, not offering an unique (or empathetic) perspective.", "YTA, mind your own business and stay in your lane. you\u2019re the reason people leave their christian families behind.", "YTA - you're the typical christain who wants everybody to bow down to your beliefs and then doesn't have to respect other beliefs.  In fact, disrespectful of others.  Just because your family indoctrinated you into the christain faith doesn't mean it is real.", "YTA.  It wasn't your business that she didn't bow her head in prayer when she doesn't believe.  That you want her, an adult, to be a Christian is irrelevant. If at 13 you haven't learned that you don't always get what you want, you need some hard lessons.\n\nYou were not asking out of curiosity.  We adults can figure out curious questions versus shaming questions from people your age.  Back the \\[expletive\\] off, if you're genuinely curious you can engage your aunt at another time, and respect her as a person.  That means not demanding, in front of the rest of the family, that she defend her beliefs to you.", "YTA. You are 13. Time to learn to mind your own business.", "Yes, YTA. You need to learn not to be so insufferable and intrusive.", "YTA. I'm pagan and get approached by Christians/Catholics way too much to be comfortable. Some back off when I say I'm pagan, but too many are like you- questioning my beliefs and implying they are wrong and things like that.\n\nBut hey, I just want to know. Why do *you* believe in God? Like seriously, come on. Why do you believe in him? Don't you know that Thor protects Midgard?", "YTA. You started out saying, \"I gave her a dirty look\". You made her feel uncomfortable. Your disapproval of her was likely much more obvious than you realize. \n\nBut let me rephrase this, in terms you might better understand. You can look up the verses yourself\u2026\n\nThere is a time for everything. A time to be silent and a time to speak.  (When you have welcomed someone into your home, and welcomed them to your table, this in not the time to judge a person and make them uncomfortable. There will be other times to have a discussion.)\n\nOffer hospitality without grudging. \n\nAccept one another as Christ has accepted you. (This asks you to open your heart, not just to other Christians).", "I can see why your aunt would be distancing herself from your family. \n\nIf your God is the almighty and you, as a human are flawed and a sinner, why then are you qualified to cast judgment on your aunt? Outcasting and shaming her from a family mean is precisely the opposite of what Jesus preached. Lead by example with love and without judgement. \n\nYou have a great deal to learn. Your response really highlights your lack of maturity and how much room you have to grow into or even out of your religion. \n\nYTA", "YTA , you physically showed displeasure in your aunt NOT BEING a hypocrite. You know she\u2019s an atheist and began interrogating her specially asking her questions and painting her in way that she is in the wrong. \n\n\nDid she hurt people? Did she kill people? Did she steal from people? Did she assault people? Is she cruel to people or takes pleasure in hurting others? Ask yourself\u2026..why do you see her as being wrong for simply not participating in organized religion? \n\n\nNo religion is the right religion. Being one or the other does not make you more righteous or pious. Does not make you a better person. Especially if you decide that because someone is not Christian they are in the wrong. That falls into bigotry. You may not have wanted to be TA but this is where religious people start crossing the line. Because being a good person is not whether you call yourself a Christian or follow a specific religion. Being a good person is how you treat others and help people. So you owe your aunt an apology because you purposely made her feel bad because she did not fit into what you \u201cbelieve\u201d is good. Be a good person and treat others with respect and kindness regardless of their religion? Isn\u2019t that what Jesus would say?", "YTA and a huge one to boot!  Your religious beliefs are just that, your beliefs.  You have absolutely no right to push your beliefs on others.  You are part of the reason Christians are viewed with distrust and distain.  Christianity has forced their beliefs on others with violence and death for centuries.  Your aunt went to dinner with you, not to church.  She doesn't have to believe in your imaginary sky daddy any more than you have to participate in her non-religious views of the world.  You owe your aunt an apology.", "Welp, you're certainly turning into a typical holier than thou fundy who thinks it's your way or the highway.\n\nNot everyone believes what you do. And no one has the right to shove their bigoted flying spaghetti monster down anyone else's throat. \n\nDo yourself a favor and actually READ the Bible. Cover to cover. Every word. Then come back and tell us you still believe it.\n\nOh, and yeah, YTA.", "You're a little shit.  If I was your aunt I would've stood up real fast during your dinner interrogation and dumped my food on your lap, then left.  YTA.", "YTA but gentle because of your age. You made the meal unwelcoming to your aunt because of her belief systems. You monitored her during blessing, let her know you noticed the fact she didn't bow to a God she no longer believes in, forced a conversation as to why she no longer believes and implied the family were talking about her and were unwelcoming because she was weird.\n\nPeople do change belief systems over time, often after traumatic events. You don't know why your aunt stopped believing and it may involve things she doesn't want to talk about, let alone to a judgemental teen.\n\nSo, yes you were a AH for deliberately making your aunt feel unwelcome. Religion and politics best avoided at meals.", "Soft YTA, only because of your age and you need to learn tolerance. That is a Christian trait. How will you persuade someone to see things as you see them when you treat them like something is wrong with them?\nYou gave your aunt a \"dirty look\" because she did not bow her head. Everyone doesn't bow their head or hold their hands together when someone is praying. She wasn't being disruptive or bothering anyone. How would you like it if someone gave you a dirty look for bowing your head or kneeling in prayer? \n\nWhen asking a person a question about their beliefs, their clothes, their hairstyle, etc., and they don't want to answer the question, leave that subject alone. It makes you an AH when you keep asking. Sometimes the way you ask makes you an AH as well. You're not in court of law and she is not your child. In other words: How would you like it if someone did that to you? \n\nIf Jesus was at your dinner and saw your aunt not bowing her head in prayer, what would he say? If he was there and saw that you made your aunt feel uncomfortable, what would he say? \n\nIf I remember correctly the Bible has a passage that basically says do to others as you want them to do you. Or treat people the way you would like to be treated. \n\nIf we all did that, the world would be a nicer place to be.", "YTA", "YTA. if i were you i would work on deconstructing your feelings about her atheism. why do you wish she was christian? how would you have felt if she had converted to a different religion? anyhow, you need to learn to respect others' beliefs.", "YTA - not for your beliefs but because you were rude AF. There\u2019s a time and place for stuff - which you may eventually realize if you mature some - like having a serious talk with your aunt about her beliefs vis a vis yours.", "YTA, and your aunt is an atheist because she seems to be the only one in your family smart enough to know that god doesn't exist.", "You know, when Jesus encountered nonbelievers, he treated them well or left them alone. Take the woman at the well, for example. \n\nBy Jesus\u2019s own standards, YTA.", "YTA. You probably meant well seeing as more  than likely all you have known in life is being a Christian and have been taught your whole life your loved ones will suffer in hell if they aren\u2019t \u201csaved\u201d but you need to understand that a lot of people don\u2019t believe in god and that\u2019s absolutely okay.", "YTA - NO ONE reading this thinks you asked those questions and tacked on \"god died for your sins\" was anything other than an attempt to shame her or draw her into a religious debate.  \n\n\nShe answered politely and maturely and you pressed the issue.  \n\n\nI get it, you're 13, being edgy must seem like the only option. But just as I don't rub my atheism in anyone's faces, I expect them not to rub their beliefs in mine.", "I get that you are 13 but be better. If your aunt is a guest at your house and is not making an issue about partaking in something that for her is not appropriate I don\u2019t know why you are. Also you cite she is distancing herself, likely if you continue this behavior she will distance herself more. \nYTA", "YTA\n\nHonestly, you sound super obnoxious too - Your aunt has her own beliefs.\n\nYour aunt is a atheist, and news flash - SHOVING god down peoples throats, will not make them change their mind.", "You need to realize that you\u2019ve been raised in a family that has pushed their story-telling beliefs onto you. YTA for being obnoxious and disrespectful.", "YTA attempting to ostracize your aunt isn't very Christian of you.", "YTA - Sounds like you\u2019re one of \u201cthose\u201d Christians", "I figured your mom would be proud of you for not minding your own business, like a true Christian.", "YTA:  I am a Christian and....JUDGE NOT LEST YE BE JUDGED!", "You're an asshole and a sheep; attempting to preach to your aunt without even understanding how the world works is laughable. YTA.", "Is OP is really 13? This sounds like an older person pretending to be a kid to make a childish point.\n\nRegardless of actual age, YTA, and you've accomplished an awful lot of AH behavior. You don't harass other people about their beliefs. You don't try to embarrass anyone at a social gathering. You don't persist in your interrogation when you've been told to back off.

Anyway things were going fine and as we were getting ready to eat we were about to pray. And then I noticed to my immediate right my aunt 34f, not taking part or even bowing her head down. This aunt is an atheist, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me but it feels like she is distancing herself from us more ever since she made the decision too many many years back. And of course it\u2019s weird for me cause I wish she was Christian like us. I wish she would have atleast bowed down. So as we were getting ready to bow our heads down I gave her a dirty look due to her attitude and she noticed it but didn\u2019t say anything. So halfway through the dinner I began asking her a few questions about her atheism. I asked her why are you an atheist? And then also said \u201dGod died for your sins\u201d and I kind of let her know that I find her atheism odd and so does my whole family too. Her cheeks became red and she said \u201dI just have different beliefs from your family, okay hun\u201d? I then asked a few more questions after that that might seem interrogative or passive aggresive(She knows we don\u2019t really like or approve of it) but they weren\u2019t I just wanted to know why she made this decision.The conversation went on for quite a bit. next morning my mom gets a text from her saying \u201dThank you for the food and company(and 3 paragraphs of yada yada) but your son made me uncomfortable and was questioning my belief(it\u2019s long but you get the point)\u201d My mom didn\u2019t even lecture me she just said we need to respect other peoples beliefs but in my defense I was just asking out of curiosity. And then she said although we don\u2019t agree with her she is still family. Tbh that\u2019s all she said (I wonder why) AITA here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So yes, even you, have sin in the eyes of the Lord. So, if you have sin, how can you judge another? Are you not just as un-Christian as she is because you believe you are equal to your God and can judge others? Supposedly Christ died for your sins as well. \n\nOne last thing, you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar. The surest way to turn someone off from your beliefs is to berate them.

My 87 year old Catholic grandfather expects exactly this of me when I\u2019m present for prayer. He does not expect me to bow my head and participate, but he does expect me to sit through it silently. He expects respect, and understands it\u2019s a two way street. Give to get respect. Do you not think you owe her the same respect that she gave you? \n\nAlso, let\u2019s bring in the fact you are a child and you were bluntly rude to and likely embarrassed an adult family member.

If you were truly and respectfully curious, then you need to apologize to your aunt for the embarrassment you caused her and ask her, if she is willing, to educate you on atheism.
