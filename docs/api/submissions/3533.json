When he'd visit or we'd go by him and his mom (different states) him and I would play video games, or football,  do stuff as a group,  etc. \n\nJeremy had kids and got married a few years ago.  His mom moved back here a few years ago.  So Jeremy and his family visit once or twice a year.  \n\nI go to school and work, part time.\n\n Jeremy (and his mom when she'd visit) thinks everyone's life stops when he visits. He won't give much notice either.\n\nSummer of 2021 it worked out that I was off while he was in town. He invited me to go to the zoo with him, his wife and his kids. I'm not really a kid person but he kept nagging me so I went.  \n\nHis daughter  Jenny is a good little girl.  She's smart and polite and a fun kid. His son Jimmy is a different story.\n\nJimmy is argumentative and rude.\n\nI had a knee brace on because I have patella femoral syndrom, our zoo is huge and I didn't want my knee to get sore.  Jenny asked about it and I said it's to help my knee. \n\nJimmy decided to keep walking in front of me or stopping short,  then asking if it hurt my knee. It didn't but it was annoying.  Jeremy told him to knock it off, Jimmy kept doing it and claiming he forgot.  \n\nJimmy is argumentative.  He kept trying to debate me about stuff with different animals.  I didn't care enough and I'm not arguing with a kid so I just said \"ok sure\" and moved on.  So he kept insisting that meant he was right and smarter than me.  \n\nHe kept wanting snacks,  I swear every snack stand we passed he wanted something,  his parents said no. Then he started asking me.  I said no. So he asked why not and said I have a job so I should buy it for him. \n\nAnyway I don't want to be around Jimmy, unless it's a bigger group. \n\nI ended up telling my aunt about how he acted. She said \"he's a kid\" and blah blah blah.  Then she told my mom that Jimmy gets bullied at school and Jeremy doesn't understand why. \n\nI guess now they think he has asperger's.  My aunt told my mom and I earlier this year.  She acted like his behavior is ok because of that though.  I still don't want to be around him .\n\nAnyway Jeremy was here for Thanksgiving. He text me in October and said we should meet up and to let him know when I'm off. I had no intention of doing that.\n \nBetween work and school my first day off was Thanksgiving, my mom and I did our own thing.  I was also off black Friday.  I met up with some friends and did lunch and drinks Friday. I never told Jeremy when I was off. A friend of mine posted a selfie of us Friday.  \n\nJeremy went home Monday.  Apparently he seen the post and said something to his mom about how \"getting drunk with my friends was more important than seeing family,  and he used to do stuff with me so I should return the favor with his kids\". \n\nMy mom said I should have just hung out with them for a little while at least and Jimmy is a kid I should let it go. \n\nAITA for blowing off my cousin because I don't wanna deal with his kid.", "created_utc": 1669733939, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7wcks/aita_for_blowing_off_my_cousin_because_of_his_kid/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they are using that \u201csuspicion\u201d to excuse his behavior, they sure as hell don\u2019t sound like they\u2019re actively pursuing an actual diagnosis.

You're young, going out with friends is fun. You can hang out with obnoxious kids when you turn 35", "\"getting drunk with my friends was more important than seeing family,\"\n\nNTA.  And yes, yes it is.  Regardless of why the kid was annoying, he was annoying.  Maybe he grew out of it, maybe he didn't.

Other people\u2019s kids are no one\u2019s responsibility and you don\u2019t have to spend time with them if you don\u2019t want to.

That doesn\u2019t mean your obligated to hang out with them, but speaking as someone who has a big family I was close to but went very far for school and missed out on significant events in my cousins lives, I don\u2019t regret it but I wish I could get that time back. Staying close to family is a two way street and if you want that closeness with Jeremy you\u2019ll probably have to at least spend sometime with his kid.

He loves you and wanted to see you once this year. You could have given him an hour fir a hug and small talk and then left.", "ESH. You were probably an annoying kid yourself  and your cousin hung out with you.  Your cousin should have intervened more in his kids behavior. Ghosting him was pretty immature.
