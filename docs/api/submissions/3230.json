We\u2019ve always had a strong relationship and I love her so much.\n\nMy wife has a best friend from childhood Jimmy 28M. I didn\u2019t know him that well but this year we\u2019ve gotten to know each other and have gotten close. He\u2019s my best bud and like an older brother to me in a lot of ways.\n\nMy wife goes all out for my birthday parties and I love them. She\u2019s more of a stoic introvert so I thought it would be nice to throw her a surprise 30th birthday with just her and me and make it a special event. I wanted to make her a gift she would love. Jimmy\u2019s an incredible artist and for the past two months I\u2019ve been taking lessons from them. My wife was curious why I was spending so much time away from home with Jimmy but I made vague excuses because I couldn\u2019t tell her I was making a gift for her. She\u2019s made a couple comments but never seemed upset.\n\nI told her a week before her birthday that I had made plans with Jimmy. I have a job with flexible hours so it\u2019s not uncommon for me to do it.  She wasn\u2019t upset or anything. When her birthday came, it was all I could do not to say anything. When she left for work, I put my plan in action. I decorated the place. I brought out the cake. I learned from youtube and stored it at our friend\u2019s house. I got a dozen bouquets of flowers. I got her a few other gifts too. \n\nShe was supposed to come home at 5:30 but she didn\u2019t. I waited hours for her but she didn\u2019t come home. I called Jimmy and he said he hadn\u2019t seen her. I called her and she didn\u2019t pick up. I checked her location and she was at a restaurant. I went to the restaurant and she was there with her friends. They were eating a birthday cake and she had presents. I never met these friends of hers before. I think they\u2019re from her work. \n\nShe seemed sad. She wasn\u2019t smiling or energetic. I wanted to take her home and show her my gift so she would be happy. I came over to her and told her she had to come home. We grabbed her things and left. On the uber back, she didn\u2019t say anything. At home she started crying. \n\nShe has been sleeping on the couch and she avoids me. My wife hasn\u2019t talked to Jimmy either. I told my mom and she called me an asshole. I don\u2019t know why.

When you plan a surprise, it\u2019s on you to make sure the person will be available.\n\nThe plans she made with her friends were not less important that your poorly executed surprise.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t use the critical piece of surprise party planning where you have her home at a certain time for a \u201cgood reason\u201d. You just made it look like you were blowing her off, and she made other plans. \n\nYou honestly just made it look like you remembered her birthday at the last minute and went overboard to try to make up for it. And instead of apologizing, you forced her to appreciate your thoughtfulness.", "YTA. You shouldn't be interrupting you wife's dinner for your awful execution of her birthday surprise. You also seem really hung up on the fact she went out which is odd to me.\n\nPerhaps the dinner plans only materlised that day.\n\nFriend: \"Hey OP's wife, what are you doing for your birthday tonight?\"\n\nOP's wife: \"Nothing - I think my husband forgot\"\n\nFriend: \"No no no, you aren't doing nothing for your birthday - we are going to get dinner\"\n\nMaybe your wife looked sad at dinner becuase she thought her husband didn't do anything for her birthday.", "YTA. You tried to do something nice, but you went about it the wrong way. Surprises are often a bad idea. This is a case and point. You told your wife you wouldn\u2019t be free on her birthday, so she made other plans. You embarrassed her in front of her friends, friends who had taken her out for her birthday. Of course she is upset.", "YTA. I hate surprise birthdays where the main message is \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten your birthday\u201d you can do surprises without that part. I don\u2019t know why people get such a boner for purposely hurting there loved ones before making them happy.", "Info: Why didn\u2019t you just join the group at the restaurant? And tell her there is a surprise at home when she\u2019s ready? Did you say anything in the Uber? Did she see the flowers/decor and not say anything? How many days ago was this, and why haven\u2019t you apologized for not communicating adequately yet?", "YTA I'm guessing she thought you forgot and that Jimmy did too, so her other friends or maybe her work friends took her out to try and cheer her up.  I get you planned something very special for her, but in the future you need to at least say something like \"don't make plans,  we already have some but I can't tell you what\".\n\nIn your wife's eyes both you and her best friend totally forgot about her special day, but the way 30 or any 10 year is considered a milestone.  \n\nPlease apologize and tell her how much you love her, that next time you will let her know that there are at least plans, even if you can't give details.  \n\nI personally know what it's like to feel forgotten, but the end of the day when my hubby didn't acknowledge or my best friend because they had planned a surprise party my mood was 100% ruined as I thought they had forgotten.  \n\nPlease, please, please communicate better. Again you don't have to tell her details, just let her know that there are at least plans and make sure to wish her happy birthday immediately on her birthday.\n\nEdit- typo", "YTA \n\nYou told her a full week in advance that you weren\u2019t available on her birthday because you\u2019d made plans with her best friend.\n\nThen you went and removed her from the place where she was actually celebrating after **stalking** her location online.\n\nI\u2019ve read your comments about you not knowing these people exist and her looking sad, she was probably sad because her husband and bestie made plans without her. Maybe she was sad because her husband is controlling and came to collect her like she was a naughty kid. \n\nHard to tell.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019ve been sneaking around and giving her vague half-@ssed excuses about where you go.  The day of her birthday you tell her you have plans and will be busy\u2026\n\nSo she makes plans on her own, goes and tries to celebrate her bday anyway because you\u2019ve been acting distant and aloof.  Then you crash that and drag her away?\n\nThe \u201csurprise\u201d wasn\u2019t for her - it was about you.  \u201cLook what I did!  Look how awesome I am!\u201d  You made her feel like crap, for weeks, then on her birthday made her feel even worse.", "YTA.  \n\n\nThe birthday ideas were sweet. You needed to arrange a plan with your wife so that she knew you hadn't forgotten. As you didn't, of course she was going to spend time with others who'd remembered.  \n\n\nDemanding that she came home from her birthday dinner was awful and absolutely out of line. Why was your response to pull her away from her chosen birthday plans to see yours? Why weren't you just relieved she was ok? Your birthday creations at home could have waited. What you did was controlling and centred around YOUR wants, not hers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToo much secretism around your plans with Jimmy will have likely come across as stand-offish or worrying to your wife.", "YTA - of course she\u2019s going to be upset and why didn\u2019t you make an arrangement or a reason to make sure she came home", "Yuck.  YTA.  You tracked her location and then pulled her out of her a dinner (in front of everyone) because *checks notes* you had presents waiting for her at home. Why could you just delay your surprise.  It was just the two of you.", "What is actually wrong with you? People were celebrating her birthday and you dragged her away?", "YTA - You led her to believe that you and her best friend had plans without her on her birthday. How do you not understand that it would be hurtful for her? How dense can you be? So she, in an attempt to cheer herself up, made other plans, then you show up demanding she go home like some sort of neanderthal. What you should have done is apologize and explain that you were attempting to surprise her and that it was waiting at home for her when she was ready. Then you should have asked to join her at the party at the restaurant.  You have royaly screwed up this birthday for her.", "Not enough info. Were they work friends or something that you didn't know? You assumed she would be home, but you also had told her you had other plans. She probably thought you were blowing off her birthday and made her own.\n\nShowing up and basically snatching her away from the group was also probably very embarrassing and rude. Sounds like the \"surprise' backfired.\n\nGonna lean YTA here. Your wife is also allowed to do her own thing.", "What the fuck is even happening with this post", "YTA. The way to do a suprise is to have a fake set of plans that act as a placeholder for the suprise.", "Ew \n\n\n> \u201cI told me wife she **had** to come home\u201d\n\nOP who do you think you are?\n\nShe was having an amazing **30th** bday party and you ruined. For what reason??? I hope you know she\u2019ll never forget this.\n\nYTA, a big one\n\nSomething tells me there\u2019s more to this story. Did you cause a scene?", "You behaved really oddly I can't lie. She made plans because you didn't. You then intruded on her dinner with her friends who had all gotten her presents, and pulled her away. And what, you didn't even give her your own gift?\n\nAt this point it feels like you've gone to all this the trouble for yourself, not ner. You want a pat on the back more than you want her to be happy on her birthday. YTA", "YTA because you ruined not only her birthday but the weeks leading up to it.", "YTA. You havent been around for a couple of months. You and her best friend completely ignore her 30th birthday - a milestone.\n\nTo make herself feel better on her birthday because her loved ones clearly didnt give a shit, she went out with some work friends.\n\nThen you fucked that up completely too by crashing her little party, dragging her off and embarrassing her. Mortifying.\n\nAnd you wonder if you are the asshole.\n\nYes. YTA. A gigantic one. That you cant even see this is alarming. The way you talk about your wife, ditto. The way you describe her is as a cipher with no agency, not a person.", "YTA\n\nYou told her you would be out with Jimmy, so she made other plans to avoid being alone. You spoiled her birthday. You started with deception. The least you could have done was let her finish with her friends. Dragging her out was a dick move and all about you. She was sad because you TOLD her you would spend time with Jimmy instead of her ON HER BIRTHDAY.\n\nI can't stand it when someone sets up a deception and thinks it's a surprise. She will remember the embarrassment of being dragged away from her friends much longer than she will the \"surprise\" you set up.\n\nDo you really need someone to explain why all of this was not cool?", "YTA. Surprise events shouldn't actually be complete surprises, because people will think you forgot about them. You've gotta at least drop a few \"nope, not giving any hints about your birthday plans, wink wink\", or have a mini-plan arranged in order to reveal the bigger plan.", "Info: does she like surprises? I hate them and this situation would make me upset too.", "Public Service Announcement:   A surprise birthday party is rarely a good idea.   A surprise birthday with ZERO GUESTS is NEVER a good idea.", "Wow\u2026 you *tracked her* when she didn\u2019t answer you and then you *forced her to go home with you*. You sound insecure at best and fucking abusive at worst. Absolutely YTA.\n\nEditing to add based on your constant \u201cshe doesn\u2019t go out ever, she doesn\u2019t have any other friends, why would she have friends I haven\u2019t met, why would I have to ask her to come straight home\u201d makes me lean even more towards you are probably controlling and she is trying to find a fucking way out. I hope she does and you realize that not communicating with your partner isn\u2019t *romantic*, it is fucked up.", "YTA\n\nShe spent the day thinking you and Jimmy didn\u2019t care enough about her to organise a single thing for her birthday, and in fact actively made plans together EXCLUDING her, and you don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s upset?\n\nThen you compounded that by dragging her away from the celebration she felt compelled to arrange for herself?\n\nDUUUUUUUDE.", "You lie to her for weeks about having plans, demand she leave her party with her friends, for the big surprise of\u2026cake and flowers? I am baffled. \n\nOh and obviously YTA\n\nEdited to add: Okay so you made her some sort artwork that you could have just given her like a normal damn person and not made it all about you. Even more YTA tbh", "YTA - your intentions might have been good but were executed very poorly. You needed to make sure that OP would definitely make it home, this is where you could have gotten Jimmy to offer to take her somewhere but instead he brings her home. Or you tell her you have something planned but without telling her what. Instead she thinks you have been avoiding her, then you tell her that you\u2019re busy on her birthday (who does that??) so she made her own plans. Then you went and dragged her away which was very selfish on your part. It sounds like you have poor communication skills, which you need to work on.", "The reason why she made these plans, was she probably felt blown off by you and your \"vague excuses\" about why you're going out a good amount of time. You never gave her a smile, or a hint that you had something special planned for her birthday. You decided to be cold, not speaking to her about her birthday, didn't make her feel special, and you wonder why she's upset?\n\nYou could have sent her flowers, leading up to her birthday. You could have dropped little mini presents, maybe a bottle of wine and chocolate one night (trying to give you possible hints for the future, and if she's into that), and made her feel special. She goes all out for you, and you pretty much ignore her. Take it from someone who is also stoically introverted. These little surprises go a long way, and we, too, want to feel special. \n\nYTA, and you'll need to talk things through with her, because you made her birthday suck.", "YTA - I hope you had a good run of things cause you're relationship with your wife is going to take a sharp downward turn from this point.   You completely embarrassed her in front of her friends - and you looked like a total abusive partner doing so.   This isn't going to go well, especially if these are work friends and she sees them every day.", "YTA you told her a week before you were going to have plans on her birthday wirh her childhood best friend. \n\nHer birthday you decided not not even acknowledge her birthday. You fucked up and yet you think you did nothing wrong.\nHer co workers did something nice to make her feel special and you decided to crash it and embarrassed her by telling her she needed to come home. Them forcing her to leave her birthday party.\n\nOf course she would be upset. You ruined her birthday. You and Jimmy owe her a massive appolgy", "YTA - If you're throwing a surprise party, you need to enlist people to make sure the person shows up as intended. There was no reason not to tell her you were around Jimmy to get art lessons. That wasn't a gift for her, btw. It was a gift to yourself. \n\nYou waited hours before trying to call her or Jimmy?? The fact that she didn't pick up when you finally called should have been a hint that you messed up. All of this crap about her being \"stoic & introverted\" makes me wonder about this marriage.", "Either a troll post or you're incredibly naive OP. Still, YTA. You definitely came off as an immature 26yo in this post. The lack of communication, the selfishness of your actions, the fact that you can't even read your wife's emotions.. she wasn't sad because of the other people, she was sad because of you! Hell, your secrecy probably led her to believe you were having an affair.. grow the hell up.", "Well yeah, YTA. Start communicating better with your wife.", "YTA She's a grown woman and can make decisions for herself about who she wants to have dinner with. If there is a next time, find a way to 'reserve' the surprise party time without giving away the surprise.", "YTA - your wife made plans for her birthday b/c she thought you didn\u2019t. Then you publicly humiliate her by showing up at where she was to drag her home like an errant child. On top of that, you GPS tracked her to where she was, like she was a child.", "YTA.  But it least she will always remember her 30th. Good job", "YTA - yeah, she thought you hadn\u2019t planned anything for her birthday so she took care of it herself. And then you ruined that too. You owe her a massive apology and an explanation.", "YTA. \n\nShe\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem to like \u201csurprises\u201d and she probably figured you forgot her birthday. This is what you get for failing to have basic communication with her. \n\nSurprising her was never about what she wanted. It was about you showing off.", "YTA. You told her you had plans on her birthday. She was probably sad at work and when someone asked, she probably said that her husband made other plans on her 30th birthday. Even people I\u2019m not close to at work would clamor to make me feel special if the one who was supposed to do that completely ignored you. You said you had plans. She normally doesn\u2019t, but made them when you ghosted her birthday so she wouldn\u2019t spend her birthday alone.", "My husband surprised me with my best friend meeting us on vacation. We planned the trip, but he included her without me knowing for months and it was a huge amazing surprise! I even invited her and she had to tell me she was not available/could not afford it, so understandable. He was being a little bit of a dick within THE HOUR of the surprise to throw me off, but he didn't ignore me for months and the day off entirely, that would be fucking ridiculous.\n\nBad execution. Grand surprises aren't fun if you make her feel unwanted and unloved beforehand. You should have hinted at vague plans if you wanted to keep a surprise, at BARE minimum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA", "YTA but I don't think from your description you had any malice. You were trying to do something good for your partner, but you just did it in a way that involved some missteps. By spending so much time alone with her very close friend (without her), I bet you were making her feel excluded. Not only was her husband being distant from her...he was being distant from her *with one of her closest friends*, which probably made her feel even more excluded.\n\nThen you tell her you have plans with *him* on her birthday, and she is probably very sad, it probably comes up with a work friend (or maybe they can just tell she's upset) so they take her out after work to cheer her up. At the point you spring the big reveal on her, I think so much \"emotional damage\" had been done it doesn't help the situation but just makes it worse.\n\nLike I said, I think, from your description, you had zero active malice here. I think you just need to really work on communicating with her (and that probably **isn't** one sided, she probably needs to work on communicating her feelings too--she just isn't here to read our advice.)", "You threw a surprise party for you and your wife and you have been probably more absent from home due to these lessons.\n\nYou never told her you had plans or even suggested it so she would come home. And then told her the day of her birthday you were hanging out with Jimmy. \n\nSo she assumed you forgot or didn't care and because you never prepared her for a possible birthday celebration she prepared and planned one herself. \n\nYa...so a soft YTA only because you meant well but it wasn't executed well. \n\nSitting down and explaining what was up will help. But also the fact you haven't met these friends ever suggests you are maybe more checked out of her personal life than you think.", "Yta, you basically abandon your wife for weeks, giving her no real answers why you aren't around just that you need to hang out with a certain buddy all the time. \n\nThen her birthday comes up and to her you blow her to spend time with the buddy you've basically left her on the side of the road to be with.\n\nTo top it off, you track her down and decide that since she didn't have a super happy look on her face, that you would take her home and show her all the work you did into her gift, and surprise surprise surprise, like Gomer would say she breaks down crying and is distant with you. \n\nLet's break this down, cause more and more of your responses all focus on what you've done, what you put into it, and the that your wife didn't include you in on her bday plans. \n\n1. Spending time with Jimmy, a lot of time, basically blowing off your wife and not giving her really any idea what you're doing\n\n2. She's made comments, but you were like, \"who cares, she doesn't seem upset. She'll be all good when she gets her present\" and ignore her concerns. \n\n3. Then you tell her, \"oh honey, I'll be out with Jimmy on your birthday. Hope you're cool with that\" \n\n4. Seemingly didn't really interact with her the day of her birthday, being more concerned with getting your amazing gift setup for a wife who has been tossed aside\n\n5. You track her down cause she didn't come home from work when you expected her to. Then see her with friends that you don't know and assume from the look on her face she didn't want to be there, told her she's going home\n\nTake a step back, you literally lied to your wife for weeks, didn't tell her what was going on, you're always hanging out with the same guy, not giving any really clear answers, and dismissing her concerns cause she doesn't seem angry, then her birthday rolls around only to be told your hanging out with Jimmy AGAIN, instead of with her. \n\nShe probably thought you were cheating on her, and from all the signs, it was pointing that way. Then your responses to others just makes it seem you were more upset you didn't get to give her the gift you made and come out like a white knight to save the princess. \n\nSorry you messed up big time here, and it'll take a long time maybe if you're lucky to try and fix your relationship", "Oh wow! YTA so badly. How dare you? That wasn\u2019t romantic, that was a bullying move and you are an asshole for that. It was HER birthday, you could\u2019ve waited for her to finish celebrating with her friends before showing her your surprise. After all, she was going to go home to you. What is your issue?", "YTA. Let me take a guess about how your wife was feeling: You and Jimmy were becoming close friends, which she thought was great at first, until you guys seemingly started excluding her from plans. So she feels like she\u2019s lost the company of both her husband and her best friend. Then said husband and friend seem to forget her 30th birthday, and she feels devastated. So someone at work (or wherever) finds out she has no plans for her birthday and rightfully tries to rectify that with the party at the restaurant. Your wife, still sad about the abandonment, goes to the party, thinking she\u2019ll make the best of it since the jerks in her life forgot her. Then you show up and tell her to come home\u2014which I\u2019m sure seemed weird as heck to the friends and is something your wife will now have to explain. And if I understand correctly, you haven\u2019t given her the gift yet, so she still thinks you\u2019re the jerk who\u2019s abandoned her for her best friend and also the one who demanded for no reason she come home away from a party where people gave a crap about her birthday. \n\nIf this is real, you really screwed up.", "I am confused. Was she out with friends she didn't like or was she kidnapped? She wasn't smiling or energetic? What does that mean? She didn't want to be there with those people or she was mad you showed up?\n\nNot enough info here.", "You know the important part of throwing a surprise for someone is making sure you have someone make fake plans with them so this exact scenario doesn\u2019t happen? YTA", "YTA\n\nYou're such an idiot.", "YTA this was a milestone birthday and for all she knew you forgot about it\n\nYou could have kept some element a surprise without making her feel like she was forgotten", "YTA you highjacked her birthday. You should have waited for her to come home. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t want her to make plans in the first place, you should have told her you had plans for her.", "There's more then a few ways that YTA through your post and follow up comments. \n\nYour birthday plan that started with good intentions included lying to your wife for weeks about why you were spending all your time with her best friend. Makes it look like and affair. \n\nThen you literally told her you made plans with HER best friend on HER Birthday....who was she supposed to spend it with if you were both busy? Let's clarify you working and you spending time with her best friend are to very different things. \n\nThen when she makes plans with friends so she isn't a alone for her Birthday, you show up suddenly and crash those plans, by basically stalking her location. Then make claims she was \"unhappy to be there\" Ever think she was unhappy cause you made it seem like you forgot her Birthday? \n\nLastly a 30th Birthday is a milestone Birthday, you shouldn't have used her Best Friends as your cover story for what you were doing the night of her Birthday making her think she was all alone.", "YTA. She probably thought you forgot her birthday when you said you had plans, how the hell was she to know you expected her to go home to an empty home after work on her birthday, and a milestone birthday at that, so she made plans with friends. And just because you haven't met them doesn't mean they're not good friends. You totally screwed up, and made it worse by demanding she leave a birthday celebration", "YTA.\n\nLife tip: if you're going to surprise your significant other for a major milestone birthday the time to do that is a week or weekend BEFORE the major event. SURPRISE!\n\nBy waiting until the day of (not to mention running off all the time leading up to) the event makes you TA. You should have let her know there were plans for that day, that you didn't forget, that they are special. Plan a dinner out, something special, etc. Give them something to look forward to.\n\nYou spring the surprise EARLY. (and still do the party or dinner out ON their birthday). \n\nYou made this about you (see what I made) and ignored her.", "Info: I don't really understand what happened here either.", "YTA. I understand you wanted to surprise your wife but your cover was that you had plans so you can't be surprised that she also made plans for her birthday. You're the AT because you tracked her down and dragged her away from her own party in front of everyone. You can't be angry she went out with friends as far as she knew you had plans.", "You are TA fir taking her away from her friends,  she also thinks you have been cheating on her with Jimmy. You have been going put making rubbish excuses so she planned an event with work friends as she thought her husband and best friend didn't care abd were cheating on her behind her back. How dim can you be?", "You just don't know you're the asshole yet. That's the problem \ud83d\ude02 From your perspective no, you created a very romantic, touching thing between you and your partner, and it sounds amazing but it also sounds maybe in a radical sense, that you and Jimmy have been getting sticky behind your wife's back. Now I'm not saying that's what she's thinking, but you've been spending a lot of time together and not elaborating to your wife on what's happening. Your mom calling you an asshole is also quite strange. There's trouble afoot", "YTA \n\nYou told her she had to come back. \n\nSomething is wrong with you. You don\u2019t have healthy boundaries. I\u2019m concerned.", "YTA I'm surprised she even left with you probably only did so to avoid a scene", "YTA\n\nCommunication would have gone a long way.", "YTA- at the point you were tracking her down and \u201cmade her go home\u201d her birthday was about you.  How you did this great thing and you couldn\u2019t wait to show her.  She had plans- I\u2019m sure she was having a great time.  You drug her home.  Geesh", "YTA\n\nYou told your wife you had plans on her 30th birthday with her best friend. She was obviously upset and made her own plans with her work friends. You were really expecting her to just sit at home alone on her 30th birthday?

I\u2019m 26M. We\u2019ve always had a strong relationship and I love her so much.\n\nMy wife has a best friend friend from childhood Jimmy 28M. I didn\u2019t know him that well but this year we\u2019ve gotten to know each other and have gotten close. He\u2019s my best bud and like an older brother to me in a lot of ways.\n\nMy wife goes all out for my birthday parties and I love them. She\u2019s more of a stoic introvert so I thought it would be nice to throw her a surprise 30th birthday with just her and me and make it a special event. I wanted to make her a gift she would love. Jimmy\u2019s an incredible artist and for the past two months I\u2019ve been taking lessons from them. My wife was curious why I was spending so much time away from home with Jimmy but I made vague excuses because I couldn\u2019t tell her I was making a gift for her. She\u2019s made a couple comments but never seemed upset.\n\nI told her a week before her birthday that I had made plans with Jimmy. I have a job with flexible hours so it\u2019s not uncommon for me to do it.  She wasn\u2019t upset or anything. When her birthday came, it was all I could do not to say anything. When she left for work, I put my plan in action. I decorated the place. I brought out the cake. I learned from youtube and stored it at our friend\u2019s house. I got a dozen bouquets of flowers. I got her a few other gifts too. \n\nShe was supposed to come home at 5:30 but she didn\u2019t. I waited hours for her but she didn\u2019t come home. I called Jimmy and he said he hadn\u2019t seen her. I called her and she didn\u2019t pick up. I checked her location and she was at a restaurant. I went to the restaurant and she was there with her friends. They were eating a birthday cake and she had presents. I never met these people before. She wasn\u2019t smiling or energetic. I came over to her and told her she had to come home. We grabbed her things and left. On the uber back, she didn\u2019t say anything. At home she started crying. \n\nShe has been sleeping on the couch and she avoids me. My wife hasn\u2019t talked to Jimmy either. I told my mom and she called me an asshole. I don\u2019t know why. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This isn\u2019t one day that this happened, you did it routinely for weeks and it grew more and more in her head of why you were being so vague about why you were hanging out with Jimmy.

It was all very suspicious to her and then doing the same thing the day of her birthday she decided she was going out with friends to try to make herself feel better for her birthday but when you arrived and saw her sad it\u2019s because how could she have a good time when her husband and her closest and oldest friends were keeping her out of the loop on what you two were doing and being so secretive about it and basically ditched her for her birthday.

You care so much about her feelings with all of these things but risked her feeling sad that her husband forgot her birthday and then dumbfounded by the situation? I just don't think it's real.", "YTA big time. You don't blow someone off for weeks before their birthday to hangout with someone who is a MUTUAL friend without them every single time. That would make anyone sad to begin with. You added insult to injury by not making up a better excuse for your time away with Jimmy, you could have told her half truths, such as that you were taking lessons for *something* with an instructor, or even said they were art lessons, but just because you have always wanted to learn. It didn't have to give away the surprise for her to still know what you were doing and why you were running off all the time. \nAlso, just because your wife's normal routine includes coming home after work, you messed up big time by not actually expressing that she should come home after work and that there was *something* planned. It is never, I repeat, NEVER a good idea to pretend that you forgot someone's birthday *entirely*. You should have made it clear you wanted to do something with her even if what you tell her you have planned is a lie. IE I surprised my boyfriend last year by telling him we were going to get dinner with his best friend, but I left our apartment unlocked and had my sister and everyone else come over and decorate while we were out, so that when we got home his *real* birthday celebration could start. Trust me when I say he was very surprised. It does not matter at all that your wife usually doesn't go out, or that she always comes home after work, you have to express that you want to spend that time with a person, yes even someone you live with, otherwise you have NO right to be upset when they fill that time with something else/ make other plans. \nYou're also a total tool for making her leave the people she was with. If she was really upset at work and her friends took her out, just because she looked \"unenthusiastic\" and \"sad\" didn't mean it was at all related to the immediate situation. The more likely thing is that she was unable to instantly shake her massive disappointment with YOU even in good company that was trying to celebrate her. To make her leave and pull her away from people who did communicate that they wanted to spend time with her was horrendous of you. You should have let her know while she was still with them, that you had a surprise waiting for her at home once she was done and that you would be waiting for her. Yes that means you sitting around and keeping that surprise under wraps for a bit longer, but that's the price you pay for not actually inviting her to do anything with you. You aren't a child. You could have waited patiently for her to get home to enjoy what you made for her, and additionally apologize for any confusion and explain that you just wanted it to be a surprise. You seem clueless, and I won't be \"surprised\" when you find out that there is a lot you have done that has hurt your wife throughout your relationship that she has left unsaid because you're about as receptive as a broken antenna.", "YTA - the first rule of doing something nice for someone is making sure you\u2019re doing it for them and not to make yourself feel good.  You saw in your head, a plan where you were a birthday hero without considering how she actually wanted to celebrate. You let your wife think for a week that you blew off her 30th birthday. She was probably hurt and putting on a brave face. Then, she tried to make the best of the situation with other friends and you ruined that too. That pent-up hurt came out all at once and you had it coming.\n\nEdit - wife, not girlfriend.", "Good grief. Did y'all ever consider better communication?\n\n\"Let me make you a tasty dinner for your birthday\" would have had her at home when you expected.\n\n\"I'm going to dinner with my coworkers\" could have prevented the whole situation from happening in the first place.\n\nSeriously, y'all need to talk more.", "Fix this fucking title pls, so misleading", "Yta you had the right idea, poor execution.", "YTA.

You had a great plan, but your execution was extremely poor, and your actions when she did not act as expected gave the evening an unintended and very ugly turn.\n\nThis is your wife's perspective: you've been spending a lot of time lately with her childhood friend, and on her birthday, you told her that you would be with her best friend.  What did she have to come home to?  In her mind, you were not even there, and somewhere along the way, she made plans of her own. Now, she should have told you that while you were out, she was going to meet with friends herself, but that only is where she brings in a little bit of the AH, too.  BUT, she probably would not have made those plans if she thought you were planning to be home for her.  You weren't going to be home, so why would she have bothered to return to the empty house, or let you know she was returning to the empty house?\n\nBut the thing is, she didn't know you wanted her home, so she made other plans to celebrate with other people.  And when you showed up at the restaurant and demanded she come home with you...Yeah, that came across as controlling, too forceful, and rather stalkerish, because you used her phone to track her down and show up unexpectedly.  It also made you seem like a liar, since she thought you had other plans.  No doubt she felt very, very awkward when you walked up to her table, because the story she told her friends was the lie that you told her:  that you would not be home, and you had other plans on her birthday.  Yet there you were, out of the blue, insisting she go home with you.  Did you even give her a word in edgewise?\n\nOf course she was sad and not smiling.  First, you gave her the impression that her birthday was not important enough for you to prioritize it, left her to think she was forgotten on that special day, and compounded it by saying you were spending time with her best friend instead.  Then you called repeatedly, and ended up showing up unexpectedly at a place where she knew she did not tell you she would be.  You took away what little happiness she had that day, and embarrassed her in front of friends by removing her from her own little celebration gathering that probably got thrown BECAUSE she thought she had been forgotten by her own spouse.  Yes, you remembered.  But to her, you forgot all about it.  And you LET HER THINK you forgot about it.  My man, there is a reason that people tell their spouse that they as a couple are going to a friend's house for dinner, and that \"dinner\" turns out to be a surprise party in the spouse's honor.  You have to block out a portion of her time in order to surprise her, otherwise you run the risk of her making plans of her own.  She's a complete human being with complete feelings of her own, and her emotions just don't shut off when you say you're going somewhere else and leaving her to her own devices.\n\nI have no doubt that she didn't notice all the things you did for her when you both got home.  She was hurt, for many reasons, because of social/work embarrassment from how she was basically dragged home forcefully, with all her coworkers watching.  She has to return to work and explain to those people who obviously care about her exactly what had happened, and to be honest, that story is going to be very, very heartbreaking for her to recount.\n\nYou can't just make a woman think you forgot about a special occasion, then try to surprise her.  Always treat her time as though it has to be scheduled.  As others have said, just you telling her that you would like for her to come home after work, because you had something special planned for her, would have been all she needed to know and reassured her that you cared.\n\nYou owe her an apology, and a big one, because your actions, both intended and unintended, resulted in a disastrous birthday for her.  Tell her all the ways you now see that you were wrong in how you \"surprised\" her, and how wrong you were to track her down like she was an errant puppy who needed to come home because you wanted her home.  Promise her that from there on out, you will give her a heads up when you have something planned for her, and that you will never again sleuth her down just to rip her away because \"your\" unannounced plans are more important to you.  Again, your intent was very sweet, but the way you went about it was horrific.  Never, ever feign neglect or forgetfulness regarding important dates in your relationship.  If you love her deeply, you will never let her even think she is not the main priority in your life.  That terrible birthday is the only reminder you really need.

If you want her home at a certain time to accommodate specific plans, *tell her so*. Even if it seems unnecessary, because you're *sure* you know what she'll do - what if you're wrong? What if there'd been a delay, or an accident, or something came up unexpectedly? \n\nAnd work on your cover story skills. Dude.

OP knows his wife better than the rest of us so I don't get the down votes on everything they are saying.
