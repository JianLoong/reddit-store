Before she was pregnant they would have these \u201cgirls lunches\u201d every other week and usually would drink enough to be fairly tipsy to outright drunk. Our baby is one month, this is her first time having more than a few sips of alcohol after giving birth. \n\nWhen she got home I could smell the alcohol on her breath. She said she only had two drinks over the course of 3 hours and I left it alone for a little while. Once she started talking to me though it seemed as if she had more. So I asked her if she had more than two, she said \u201ctwo and a half to three\u201d. I told her I\u2019m not comfortable with her taking our son to these lunches when they are going to drink. Our sisters can be a bit pushy when it comes to drinking so I\u2019m still not convinced it was only three drinks. \n\nShe got really upset with me and said I\u2019m acting like she\u2019s some kind of drunk and that I don\u2019t feel that our son is safe with her. I told her that\u2019s not the case and I just don\u2019t want him being driven by someone who\u2019s had any drinks. I said this was the first time she\u2019s drank since giving birth and she probably should\u2019ve only had one.  She\u2019s pissed at me and I think it\u2019s completely unreasonable. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\nEdit : Thanks for the comments everyone. Just for the record I would have kept him home with me but considering it was the first girls lunch in a while I wanted our families to see him and as I\u2019ve said in it other comments, I only expected her to have one drink. I\u2019ll take responsibility for that I shouldn\u2019t have expected anything and laid out what I expected. I\u2019m going to simmer down and speak to her about it tomorrow.

Having too many is not a big deal from time to time. Why lie about it? That is not open or honest. Doesn't help promote trust, especially when a baby is involved. Being able to have that conversation is a show of responsibility. Maybe create a backup plan or a safeword so you know she needs to be picked up.", "NTA.

Let alone with a 1 month old in the car. It also brings up more questions like was she breast feeding at the time? I would have been livid if I heard that happen, and I'm fairly certain if someone saw her drinking and then driving home with the child they could justifiably call DCS.", "NTA - simple answer is you watch your son and let her go out. Insist on an Uber or some similar arrangement.", "NTA. This sounds unsafe for the baby.

Drinking and driving is never okay, especially when you have a child in the car. I would say a good solution is to keep the baby and let her go out with the girls every couple of weeks where she can Uber back home.

Her reflection on how her behavior was perceived is correct also. No drunk driving, and it's even worse with a baby in the car - child endangerment. When she is drunk, she is more likely to stumble or fall, which could be bad if she is holding an infant. Also, it compromises her ability to react quickly and correctly if a crisis starts happening.", "NTA.  Take care of your son when she goes out with her friends and have her go by Uber/Taxi so she doesn't have to drive home drunk.", "Info: Are you offering to take care of your child while she goes out?\n\nI agree that it doesn't sound like a great situation for a baby. Judgement can slip a bit after a few drinks and it's really hard to get an Uber or other ride home with a car seat. If you're offering to let her go and take over dad duty, I'm on your side. If you're asking her to quit then completely, I think this is kind of shitty.\n\nEdit: Based on OP response NTA.", "NTA drinking and driving crosses a line. Why put a baby at risk?

The follow up is that I didn't drink and drive my kids or myself.  Yes, when they were teenagers I would have two beers over the course of four hours.  We don't have many rules in our house but drinking and driving is a hard and fast one.  Drinking around children who can not change the situation easily to make it safe for them is another.  \n\nEven when my kids were old enough to drive, if I was in charge of the car there was timing on the drinks.  It was and is a family compact - we don't drink and drive.

Fuck. Yeah not okey. Completely reasonable to call her out on this and bonus points for not being an ass about it....", "Yeesh, NTA at all. Has very little to do with the drinking and everything to do with the driving. I was a full blown alcoholic for 13 years but never once drove after drinking with my kid in the car.

Then put your foot down and tell her it's unacceptable. Even if she's driving perfectly normal, if someone hits her, or there is a traffic violation, that's enough for police to be involved and then smell it or hear the alcohol on her.\n\nFucking shitty to go through pregnancy, have all that happen to your body, have your life changed by creating life with your loved one and to be so in love with your baby for it to be taken away in an instant because of someones ego and the fact they think \"they can handle it\" or \"I'm fine to drive\".\n\nShe is acting like a real piece of fucking shit", "NTA.

The consequences could have been terrible.", "NTA. She both got drunk while watching her 4 month old, drove while drunk, and did so with the 4 month old in the car.\n\nHas she previously driven while drunk? If so, you need to intervene.
