{"id": 9533, "submission_id": "10xtvuf", "title": "AITA for blocking someone?", "selftext": "I (13F) was playing a video game with a focus on outfits, but it did have some hangout areas. I was in one of them just checking it out and a guy approached me. We started talking and he seemed chill so we decided to get in contact. He first asked for my Snapchat, but I was very uncomfortable with that, especially since you can see someone's location using it, so I lied and told him I don't have it. The next best thing was Twitter. So we started chatting and I asked him how old he was. He said he was 20 something. I told him I was 13 and he said \"It doesn't matter\". At this point I thought \"Nope I've heard stories I don't need that in my life\" and blocked him, with one last message telling him my mom told me I have to block him. I talked to my mom about it afterwards and she told me I did the right thing, but I still feel like maybe he didn't wanna do anything and I was just jumping to conclusions. I've been thinking about this for some time and I just wanna get an opinion and forget about it. AITA?\n\n\nEdit: I wanted to mention that the video game is mostly marketed towards teens/tweens and that's why I just assumed he was around my age and his outfit was the default boy outfit. There are multiple and he was wearing the first one offered.\n\n\n\n\nEdit 2: I wanna thank you all for commenting! This situation was very confusing and I was worried since as soon as I read \"It doesn't matter\" I fully went into \"instinct mode\". I try to remain calm and polite, but this situation helped me realize sometimes I have to be harsher. Very glad I posted. This has been a real life lesson haha xD \n\nBut seriously, thank you all \u2665\ufe0f\n\n\n\n\nEdit 3: Just got a message from another guy \ud83d\ude43\n\n\nAsked me \"Are you really a girl?\" And when I said yes he asked me if he can make me \"try something weird\". No thanks.\n\n\nEdit 4: I have reported him!

I really hope when my kids reach teen years they do the same thing you did!\n\nI agree with other commenters though - wouldn't hurt to report him. I promise that him saying \"age doesn't matter\" ABSOLUTELY means he was a creep, you just didn't entertain him long enough for it to come out yet. He won't know it was you who reported him, there are no consequences for you, and I'm sure he'll find other places to troll but every little bit helps.", "NTA. \nA 20 year old does not have any reason to be talking to a 13 year old AT ALL.

No adult man is going to just want to just be friends with a young girl.", "NTA.  There are way too many people out there that prey on kids online, and this guy sounds suspicious.  Why ask for your Snapchat right away?  You don\u2019t owe anything to a random person online, so don\u2019t hesitate to block if someone makes you uncomfortable.", "NTA- With the exception of the teachers and adults in your life, adults should not want to talk to you.

You have the right to block anyone you don't want to talk to anymore. You did the right thing and telling your parent was the cherry on top.", "NTA. Only a 20 yr old predator would hang out in a game clearly aimed at kids in your age range. \n\nYou did a good job. Trust your gut.", "Always follow your \"gut\".  It is a warning, you are in danger.  You don't have to be \"nice\" to anyone who makes you uncomfortable, be loud and assertive.  You don't have to explain, make excuses, just a \"no, leave me alone\" and block.  There is absolutely no reason a grown man in his 20's would want a friendship or chat with a teen unless it was for a nefarious motive.", "Sorry that it's happening to you.  So many sickos out there.

There are a lot of creeps out there.", "Anyone who makes you uncomfortable should be blocked. NTA.", "NTA groomers & scouters will often go into teen marketed games with live chats available to try & look for their next mark. Better to be safe than sorry; too many creeps lurking on the internet that have bad intentions. You did the right thing by following your gut instincts; you should be very proud of yourself & I know your mom felt relief when you felt open enough to ask her about this. Keep the lines of communication open with your parents especially about things that make you feel uncomfortable; when you have confidence in your confidants that can take the power away from malicious people who will try to demoralize you into silence.", "NTA - what he said was creepy and you were right to block him. Also you can hide your location on Snapchat. I have it on ghost mode so even my friends don't see where I'm at.", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nEven if he seemed perfectly normal, you would not be T A. *You do not owe strangers your time or attention*. \n\nAt most, all you owe strangers is politeness, and even that can be immediately revoked if they show they don\u2019t deserve it (such as this guy). There are predators who weaponize politeness to get access to your money or your person.", "Hey fun life hack is that you can block random people on the internet for any time at any reason! You don't want to talk but they do? Block them! Your life doesn't need them and their life doesn't revolve around you. You don't owe them anything, let alone flirtation. You don't have to feel bad for not wanting to talk to random people and the block button is a small thing that will make your life a whole lot better and your gaming experience way more fun! NTA", "NTA\n\nBlock early, block casually, block often.\n\nThere are more people on the internet than you will ever meaningfully be able to interact with. Blocking the creepsters is good for your mental health.", "NTA always trust your instincts! There's no good reason for a twenty year old to be on a game marketed towards minors.", "NTA \n\nYou should be so proud of yourself. Keep trusting your gut and don\u2019t mess around with guys older than you. Anybody who tells you you\u2019re mature for your age is just not mature enough for people their own age. It\u2019s probably safer just not to mention your age on the internet but if you do, and the person brushes it off, that\u2019s not a good sign. A mature 20 year old would have stopped talking to you immediately. \n\nAlso sounds like you have a good relationship with your mom. Keep telling her stuff even if you might be embarrassed or worried you\u2019ll get in trouble. I promise no embarrassment or punishment is worse than the danger you might be in.\n\nETA: A good rule of thumb to use if you\u2019re hesitant or uncomfortable about an age difference is to imagine yourself as the older person in an equivalent situation. So in this case imagine interacting and being friends, or worse, with a 6 year old. Sounds really creepy right? The same applies when you are the younger one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
