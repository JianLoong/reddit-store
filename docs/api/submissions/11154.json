We have a beautiful home and a healthy daughter (3F) and we\u2019re doing amazing. Also, my wife has a son, Nick (17 M). His father is out of the picture, never really was, so Nick has been part of our family since the beginning, without distinction to our daughter.\n\nNick is on the spectrum; he\u2019s non-verbal, (or non-speaking, as my wife says), but he has always been great at communicating effectively with Fran, and he\u2019s doing better every day. To my understanding (i.e., what my wife tells me) Nick is able to communicate via his phone and his AAC communication device, but he is still considered non-verbal because he has considerable difficulties with verbalization.\n\nWell, it turns out that, a week ago, Nick said his first fully formed \"words.\" He mumbled something along the lines of \u2018I-love-you\u2019.\n\nThat\u2019s great, and I\u2019m incredibly happy about it. The issue is that my wife, who was overflowing with joy, wanted to celebrate that very same week and go out and have a fancy dinner with us, her sister, and her mother. It was a Friday night, and honestly, I didn\u2019t feel like going out and I wasn't in the mood to celebrate, but I said \"Okay, sure, let\u2019s go\" to please my wife. \n\nHowever, Fran thought I was in a bad mood, and she kept teasing me about being grumpy, so I teased her with \"Well, we didn\u2019t celebrate our daughter\u2019s first words , did we?\" and that started a big argument. After that, I decided not to go out to \u2018celebrate\u2019 Nick's mumbled words, and I stayed home. My wife was visibly upset, and the fight escalated on both sides. I pointed out who paid half of Nick\u2019s expenses, and she pointed out that she raised him by herself for more than a decade. We both said stupid things**. To be clear:** I didn\u2019t say the celebration was stupid or unnecessary, I just pointed out it was unusual and not a traditional thing people celebrate.\n\nThat\u2019s it. I think she was drowning in a glass of water, and the situation was stupid and escalated out of nowhere. It\u2019s not THAT crazy to not want to go out and \u2018celebrate\u2019, isn't it?

If that\u2019s the case, and she is essentially tracking the milestones that we expect people to hit, why would her speaking necessarily be cause for celebration? \n\nOn the other hand, you have a child whom you claim you have raised \u201cwithout distinction\u201d from your daughter. First, if that\u2019s the case, why create a distinction here? Second, it appears Nick was not supposed to be able to achieve verbalization AND NEVERTHELESS DID. Perhaps that is a distinction worth recognizing? \n\nFrom your tone, and albeit I will accept we obviously have to read into each other\u2019s tones online to some degree, it feels like you assessed that nick\u2019s \u201cmumbling\u201d wasn\u2019t worth your effort to celebrate.

We have a beautiful home and a healthy daughter (3F) and we\u2019re doing amazing. Also, my wife has a son, Nick (17 M). His father is out of the picture, never really was, so Nick has been part of our family since the beginning, without distinction to our daughter.\n\nNick is on the spectrum; he\u2019s non-verbal, (or non-speaking, as my wife says), but he has always been great at communicating effectively with Fran, and he\u2019s doing better every day. To my understanding (i.e., what my wife tells me) Nick is able to communicate via his phone and his AAC communication device, but he is still considered non-verbal because he has considerable difficulties with verbalization.\n\nWell, it turns out that, a week ago, Nick said his first fully formed \"words.\" He mumbled something along the lines of \u2018I-love-you\u2019.\n\nThat\u2019s great, and I\u2019m incredibly happy about it. The issue is that my wife, who was overflowing with joy, wanted to celebrate that very same week and go out and have a fancy dinner with us, her sister, and her mother. It was a Friday night, and honestly, I didn\u2019t feel like going out and I wasn't in the mood to celebrate, but I said \"Okay, sure, let\u2019s go\" to please my wife. \n\nHowever, Fran thought I was in a bad mood, and she kept teasing me about being grumpy, so I teased her with \"Well, we didn\u2019t celebrate our daughter\u2019s first words , did we?\" and that started a big argument. After that, I decided not to go out to \u2018celebrate\u2019 Nick's mumbled words, and I stayed home. My wife was visibly upset, and the fight escalated on both sides. I pointed out who paid half of Nick\u2019s expenses, and she pointed out that she raised him by herself for more than a decade. We both said stupid things**. To be clear:** I didn\u2019t say the celebration was stupid or unnecessary, I just pointed out it was unusual and not a traditional thing people celebrate.\n\nThat\u2019s it. I think she was drowning in a glass of water, and the situation was stupid and escalated out of nowhere. It\u2019s not THAT crazy to not want to go out and \u2018celebrate\u2019, isn't it?

YTA, big time.", "this, plus him talking about a child on the spectrum \u201cgetting better every day\u201d says to me that he views Nick\u2019s autism as \u201csomething to be cured\u201d in the way awful orgs like Autism Speaks do. \n\nalso i have no interest in having or being around kids ever and even I tested up when I read that Nick said I love you to his mom for the first time! I honestly would bake them a whole ass cake bc that\u2019s so wonderful and loving! Imagine all the stress she\u2019s had to go through as a mom caring for him alone for 10 years and watching the world treat him like a lesser human being (including her now husband potentially) and then getting this moment of love and joy with her son! This is one of the clearest YTA i\u2019ve seen in a *very very* long time", "I literally have tears of joy in my eyes, thinking about how the mom and her kid must feel. OP is so much TA.", "I've heard of \"stealing milestones\" as a behavior of narcissists. As in, \"This achievement isn't about me, therefore it's stupid. Let me make this about me!\"\n\nNarcissism gets thrown around a lot, but here it sounds like it applies. I genuinely can't think of who else would diminish such an achievement by a teenager with autism.", "Good catch. I missed that.", "Came here to say that. The \"healthy daughter\" thing doesn't sit right with me. Whether it's conscious or not, it's a very clear (even though he probably thought he was being lowkey) jab at Nick for being neurodivergent. Same thing with \"we're doing amazing // also my wife has a son\" as if Nick is the one smear in his perfect life. OP, if there's one smear in this family, I can assure you it's you.\n\nHuge YTA and I dearly hope for the sake of Fran and Nick (and the baby daughter) that OP gets his head out of his arse asap.", "This man doesn't just not care about his stepson speaking, he seems to not care about the kid at all. Despite his insistence that his stepson is seen no differently than his daughter, it stands out how dismissively he describes Nick in the first few paragraphs (\"to my understanding (i.e. what my wife tells me)\"; how does he not know how well his stepson is able to communicate? They live together!). Had it been their daughter who first spoke after 17 years I doubt OP would have had trouble finding the energy to celebrate.", "I\u2019m an internet stranger who doesn\u2019t even have kids and I got emotional thinking about waiting 17 years to hear my kid say \u201cI love you\u201d. OP is a monumental asshole.", "We had a previously nonverbal child say his first ever words in my workplace once (I don't typically work with kids specifically just the general public) and the mother got really emotional and rushed him out. When she came back another time she told us, and even us strangers cried. What a fucking moment. For a stepfather who supposedly loves this boy, this is an inhuman response. If that mother had asked me to cook and serve dinner for them on the spot I would have.", "Because it is heartbreaking.", "Nah. Head lice is contagious and will affect everyone around him, not just as home either (just sitting in the same chair as someone who had lice can genuinely give the fuckers a chance to get to you, so his coworkers, hotels, people on planes with him, etc would all be hit by the lice too).\n\nChronic joint pain is the answer here. It\u2019s not life ending, it\u2019s not contagious, it\u2019s an invisible disability so it\u2019s therefor downplayed so much by society that you\u2019ll forever still be expected to contribute fully, and it\u2019s discomfort over your whole body rather than just your head.", "> After that, I decided not to go out and \u2018celebrate\u2019 Nick\u2019s mumbled words \n\nYeah\u2026", "He seems indifferent, really.", "Oh, please don\u2019t wish this on people. I would much rather his socks and underwear always be slightly damp.", "Even worse, an unstoppable itch in the middle of the sole of his foot.", "\"Mumbled words\" really hurts. Dude really doesn't care about the kid. ):", "I was going to say that I hope he has to get potassium through an IV on a semi-regular basis.  That stuff burns for an hour after the IV is disconnected and hurts like hell while it's going in.", "I would never wish it on any decent person. But imo the only people who deserve invisible disabilities are people like OP who look down on those with disabilities. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You MONSTER!! /s\n\nHe does deserve a good afternoon of potassium though - that shit burns on a whole other level of pain!! But what a dick OP is, right?"]}
