We have a beautiful home and a healthy daughter (3F) and we\u2019re doing amazing. Also, my wife has a son, Nick (17 M). His father is out of the picture, never really was, so Nick has been part of our family since the beginning, without distinction to our daughter.\n\nNick is on the spectrum; he\u2019s non-verbal, (or non-speaking, as my wife says), but he has always been great at communicating effectively with Fran, and he\u2019s doing better every day. To my understanding (i.e., what my wife tells me) Nick is able to communicate via his phone and his AAC communication device, but he is still considered non-verbal because he has considerable difficulties with verbalization.\n\nWell, it turns out that, a week ago, Nick said his first fully formed \"words.\" He mumbled something along the lines of \u2018I-love-you\u2019.\n\nThat\u2019s great, and I\u2019m incredibly happy about it. The issue is that my wife, who was overflowing with joy, wanted to celebrate that very same week and go out and have a fancy dinner with us, her sister, and her mother. It was a Friday night, and honestly, I didn\u2019t feel like going out and I wasn't in the mood to celebrate, but I said \"Okay, sure, let\u2019s go\" to please my wife. \n\nHowever, Fran thought I was in a bad mood, and she kept teasing me about being grumpy, so I teased her with \"Well, we didn\u2019t celebrate our daughter\u2019s first words , did we?\" and that started a big argument. After that, I decided not to go out to \u2018celebrate\u2019 Nick's mumbled words, and I stayed home. My wife was visibly upset, and the fight escalated on both sides. I pointed out who paid half of Nick\u2019s expenses, and she pointed out that she raised him by herself for more than a decade. We both said stupid things**. To be clear:** I didn\u2019t say the celebration was stupid or unnecessary, I just pointed out it was unusual and not a traditional thing people celebrate.\n\nThat\u2019s it. I think she was drowning in a glass of water, and the situation was stupid and escalated out of nowhere. It\u2019s not THAT crazy to not want to go out and \u2018celebrate\u2019, isn't it?

If that\u2019s the case, and she is essentially tracking the milestones that we expect people to hit, why would her speaking necessarily be cause for celebration? \n\nOn the other hand, you have a child whom you claim you have raised \u201cwithout distinction\u201d from your daughter. First, if that\u2019s the case, why create a distinction here? Second, it appears Nick was not supposed to be able to achieve verbalization AND NEVERTHELESS DID. Perhaps that is a distinction worth recognizing? \n\nFrom your tone, and albeit I will accept we obviously have to read into each other\u2019s tones online to some degree, it feels like you assessed that nick\u2019s \u201cmumbling\u201d wasn\u2019t worth your effort to celebrate.

We have a beautiful home and a healthy daughter (3F) and we\u2019re doing amazing. Also, my wife has a son, Nick (17 M). His father is out of the picture, never really was, so Nick has been part of our family since the beginning, without distinction to our daughter.\n\nNick is on the spectrum; he\u2019s non-verbal, (or non-speaking, as my wife says), but he has always been great at communicating effectively with Fran, and he\u2019s doing better every day. To my understanding (i.e., what my wife tells me) Nick is able to communicate via his phone and his AAC communication device, but he is still considered non-verbal because he has considerable difficulties with verbalization.\n\nWell, it turns out that, a week ago, Nick said his first fully formed \"words.\" He mumbled something along the lines of \u2018I-love-you\u2019.\n\nThat\u2019s great, and I\u2019m incredibly happy about it. The issue is that my wife, who was overflowing with joy, wanted to celebrate that very same week and go out and have a fancy dinner with us, her sister, and her mother. It was a Friday night, and honestly, I didn\u2019t feel like going out and I wasn't in the mood to celebrate, but I said \"Okay, sure, let\u2019s go\" to please my wife. \n\nHowever, Fran thought I was in a bad mood, and she kept teasing me about being grumpy, so I teased her with \"Well, we didn\u2019t celebrate our daughter\u2019s first words , did we?\" and that started a big argument. After that, I decided not to go out to \u2018celebrate\u2019 Nick's mumbled words, and I stayed home. My wife was visibly upset, and the fight escalated on both sides. I pointed out who paid half of Nick\u2019s expenses, and she pointed out that she raised him by herself for more than a decade. We both said stupid things**. To be clear:** I didn\u2019t say the celebration was stupid or unnecessary, I just pointed out it was unusual and not a traditional thing people celebrate.\n\nThat\u2019s it. I think she was drowning in a glass of water, and the situation was stupid and escalated out of nowhere. It\u2019s not THAT crazy to not want to go out and \u2018celebrate\u2019, isn't it?

Your wife has waited, and hoped, and cried and prayed, and your stepson has worked really hard in his sp ed classes at school, and 17 years later, he finally verbalizes his first words.

Pretty much, \"Yeh, our toddler has already done that.\"", "YTA - This is a massive achievement for Nick. I remember the first time my eldest son spoke coherently at the age of 8.

Going out and celebrating first words is stupid in my opinion but it\u2019s one of those situations that you just shut up and go along with.

I work with many individuals that are on the austism spectrum and trust me when I say what those accomplishments you consider minor are actually immensely huge to someone who has difficulty not only formulating words but being able to express them. My current client has his own language and scripts a lot but when he uses a full sentence or tells us he loves us then we praise him for it and we get excited.

The milestones that they'll celebrate with their daughter are not going to be the same milestones they celebrate with 'Nick'.  They are individuals and should be treated as such.

I love how he talks as if Nick is the intruder in the family that was added later. If his bio dad wasn't in the picture I assume Fran and Nick were together when she met OP. He is the one that became part of a family! \n\nDude is preaching about no distinctions and shit but from the first paragraph made it clear.  The fact he mentioned 'healthy daughter' and immediately after mentions Nick is on the spectrum also rubs me the wrong way considering how he downplayed his achievement.", "Exactly. There are typical milestones that most people have and then there are personal milestones which range from \"world record - only person ever to do this\" to \"99% of people have done this, but for one reason or another, this is a special achievement to this person at this time\". Unless somebody is proud of having harmed somebody else (or is trying to take somebody else's moment), just celebrate with them.

To a person, every woman I know, who had a child young and raised that child for years on her own, then later married, has occasionally wondered if her life and the life of her oldest child would have been better, if she and that oldest child had just remained a twosome.\n\nNow, most of those women have come to the conclusion that they're glad they married their spouse, but not all of them.\n\nIf OP wants his wife's idle musings to conclude in his favor, he had better find a way to learn how to care about Nick, as if he were his own. It's easy for most people to bond with an infant. It takes more work, when you marry into a family with an older child, but it is part of the job.
