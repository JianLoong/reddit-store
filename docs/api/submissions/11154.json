We have a beautiful home and a healthy daughter (3F) and we\u2019re doing amazing. Also, my wife has a son, Nick (17 M). His father is out of the picture, never really was, so Nick has been part of our family since the beginning, without distinction to our daughter.\n\nNick is on the spectrum; he\u2019s non-verbal, (or non-speaking, as my wife says), but he has always been great at communicating effectively with Fran, and he\u2019s doing better every day. To my understanding (i.e., what my wife tells me) Nick is able to communicate via his phone and his AAC communication device, but he is still considered non-verbal because he has considerable difficulties with verbalization.\n\nWell, it turns out that, a week ago, Nick said his first fully formed \"words.\" He mumbled something along the lines of \u2018I-love-you\u2019.\n\nThat\u2019s great, and I\u2019m incredibly happy about it. The issue is that my wife, who was overflowing with joy, wanted to celebrate that very same week and go out and have a fancy dinner with us, her sister, and her mother. It was a Friday night, and honestly, I didn\u2019t feel like going out and I wasn't in the mood to celebrate, but I said \"Okay, sure, let\u2019s go\" to please my wife. \n\nHowever, Fran thought I was in a bad mood, and she kept teasing me about being grumpy, so I teased her with \"Well, we didn\u2019t celebrate our daughter\u2019s first words , did we?\" and that started a big argument. After that, I decided not to go out to \u2018celebrate\u2019 Nick's mumbled words, and I stayed home. My wife was visibly upset, and the fight escalated on both sides. I pointed out who paid half of Nick\u2019s expenses, and she pointed out that she raised him by herself for more than a decade. We both said stupid things**. To be clear:** I didn\u2019t say the celebration was stupid or unnecessary, I just pointed out it was unusual and not a traditional thing people celebrate.\n\nThat\u2019s it. I think she was drowning in a glass of water, and the situation was stupid and escalated out of nowhere. It\u2019s not THAT crazy to not want to go out and \u2018celebrate\u2019, isn't it?

If that\u2019s the case, and she is essentially tracking the milestones that we expect people to hit, why would her speaking necessarily be cause for celebration? \n\nOn the other hand, you have a child whom you claim you have raised \u201cwithout distinction\u201d from your daughter. First, if that\u2019s the case, why create a distinction here? Second, it appears Nick was not supposed to be able to achieve verbalization AND NEVERTHELESS DID. Perhaps that is a distinction worth recognizing? \n\nFrom your tone, and albeit I will accept we obviously have to read into each other\u2019s tones online to some degree, it feels like you assessed that nick\u2019s \u201cmumbling\u201d wasn\u2019t worth your effort to celebrate.

We have a beautiful home and a healthy daughter (3F) and we\u2019re doing amazing. Also, my wife has a son, Nick (17 M). His father is out of the picture, never really was, so Nick has been part of our family since the beginning, without distinction to our daughter.\n\nNick is on the spectrum; he\u2019s non-verbal, (or non-speaking, as my wife says), but he has always been great at communicating effectively with Fran, and he\u2019s doing better every day. To my understanding (i.e., what my wife tells me) Nick is able to communicate via his phone and his AAC communication device, but he is still considered non-verbal because he has considerable difficulties with verbalization.\n\nWell, it turns out that, a week ago, Nick said his first fully formed \"words.\" He mumbled something along the lines of \u2018I-love-you\u2019.\n\nThat\u2019s great, and I\u2019m incredibly happy about it. The issue is that my wife, who was overflowing with joy, wanted to celebrate that very same week and go out and have a fancy dinner with us, her sister, and her mother. It was a Friday night, and honestly, I didn\u2019t feel like going out and I wasn't in the mood to celebrate, but I said \"Okay, sure, let\u2019s go\" to please my wife. \n\nHowever, Fran thought I was in a bad mood, and she kept teasing me about being grumpy, so I teased her with \"Well, we didn\u2019t celebrate our daughter\u2019s first words , did we?\" and that started a big argument. After that, I decided not to go out to \u2018celebrate\u2019 Nick's mumbled words, and I stayed home. My wife was visibly upset, and the fight escalated on both sides. I pointed out who paid half of Nick\u2019s expenses, and she pointed out that she raised him by herself for more than a decade. We both said stupid things**. To be clear:** I didn\u2019t say the celebration was stupid or unnecessary, I just pointed out it was unusual and not a traditional thing people celebrate.\n\nThat\u2019s it. I think she was drowning in a glass of water, and the situation was stupid and escalated out of nowhere. It\u2019s not THAT crazy to not want to go out and \u2018celebrate\u2019, isn't it? Needless to say, her entire family thinks I\u2019m the AH.  *TA acc.  I don\u2019t want to make this a big deal.*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

To have waited 17 years and then your son says I love you? C\u2019mon, this man is heartless. My husband and would have been over the moon for me and for the child. \n\nI hope this mother sees this man for who he really is and soon. He cares more about having to pay half this young mans expenses than he does about the fact he spoke these incredible words to his wife (a woman I imagine he says he loves).\n\nNot gonna lie, I\u2019d be gone out of this mans life ASAP for his lack of gaf about my son, and about my feelings for said boy.", "As an internet stranger who just tonight got a positive pregnancy test\u2026\nI am bawling at the thought of waiting 17yrs to hear my child speak and their first words being \u201cI love you\u201d. It shows how much he loves his mom that he would choose those words to say. He could\u2019ve said anything, but he made that choice. And how much you want to bet he practiced in private beforehand or even just practiced in his own head trying to make sure he would be understood?", "This post has brought back all my fond memories of my autistic boy speaking for the first time. His first \"Mummy!\" and the first time he said cookie \" and I'm like you want a cookie Omg you are telling me what you want to eat!!! He worked out very quickly that if he said cookie he'd have them thrown at him as much as he liked. And when he said\" I love you \" it sounded like\" I yuv oo\" and it was one of the best moments of my life", "It doesn\u2019t matter if it was a friend or stranger, I\u2019d bawl like a baby If I was witness to this!", "I noticed this, too. Nick is healthy, too.", "What did Chris Pratt say/do?", "And \"celebrate\" in quotes, just in case you had any doubt left about OP's thoughts on that matter.", "True.", "He has a disabled son who he talks about exactly the way op talks about his stepson. Also pretends he's \"not\" homophobic while supporting an extremely homophobic church. The latter is gross, but the former is really revolting.", "Well that's depressing to learn :/ I feel bad for his son", "I started getting bad vibes right away from \"We have a beautiful home and a healthy daughter and we're doing amazing. Also, my wife has a son...\" Dude goes on to claim there's never been any distinction between the two kids based on their different parentage _immediately after_ separating his step-son from the rest of his life in his intro. Smh.", "<<*Wish I could hug this mom and share this amazing joy>*\\>  \nMe Too!", "Oh sweet mama. Since I can\u2019t hug this mom and celebrate her joy, I\u2019m sending my hug to you. You got this. I\u2019m sure he tells you he loves you in his way every day. Hugs Momma!!!!!"]}
