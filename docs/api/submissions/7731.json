Me and my brother are two years apart in age. When I was young my parents split and since then my dad has been in and out of gaol never staying out for more than a couple months at a time. My mum met a bloke from the city who moved here with his 1 of his kids. He didn\u2019t want to have to do much with us and so me and my brother have been excluded from all major family events for a while. This was until I was 11 and my brother was 9 when my mum had a kid from her now husband. Step dad who wasn\u2019t rich but had money then decided he didn\u2019t want to see us anymore because our step sister didn\u2019t like us. So we were kicked out. We moved in with our uncle who is an alcoholic and has been arrested multiple times for domestic violence. He lived in a crack den and sold drugs in one of the most run down looking places in the country. Our mum could barely be bothered to keep in contact we only saw her like once a year. I got a scholarship to a good school cause I\u2019m indigenous and graduated with a high atar. My brother got involved with my uncles business and by 16 was a major player in gang violence. After school I got a scholarship for university and ended up getting a good job in the city. Step dad never even spoke to me after he kicked me out when I was 11. Until he heard I got a job and tried to reconnect. But I just ignored him. That was until last year when gang wars in my town took off. My uncle has been arrested and his group been killed or force to flee. I\u2019m now 26 and I bought a house with my fianc\u00e9. I have let my brother stay at my house and am paying for some of his tafe expenses. Last Christmas my mother invited me and my brother. It was the first time I had seen her since I was 19. I should have known it was a setup. When we arrived my step dad ambushed us and demanded that I help not only pay for my step sisters house deposit but that I also help him pay for his retirement house on the beach worth 5 million. He said for all the things my mother did for me and my brother it was what she was owed. My brother and I left instantly and left back to the city the next day. That was 4 days ago now but my mother keeps texting me saying that I\u2019m a horrible person. But I didn\u2019t kick an 11 year old and 9 year old into a crack den.

Keep on giving your brother a helping hand and fx he can be another success, getting him away from a life of crime is wonderful.\n\nI hope you have some positive links to your heritage, it sucks that it isn't via your mum but you cannot be responsible to save her. Your step dad sounds greedy. The indigenous community that some of my friends are in is inspiring...lots of artists and business people celebrating culture and loving life.
