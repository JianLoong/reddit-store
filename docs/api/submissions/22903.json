But do revisit this conversation with your kids every so often. Explain it to them thoroughly that there would be no place for misconceptions and twisted truths. Explain your financial situation and that they are your priority, but your priorities differ to their mom, perhaps investing in a college fund is better than spending on a private school that you can\u2019t afford.That you don\u2019t spend on your future step daughter and your fianc\u00e9e has her own spending money. That fianc\u00e9e priority is her own daughter( though not even she is paying) and your priority is them your kids.At different stages,and in an age appropriate manner,talk about the future as well, that Mia will probably get a nice car, paid college and no debts. Explain it in a way that won\u2019t inspire jealousy. Set boundaries with your ex not to snap at your fianc\u00e9e and I hope that wasn\u2019t in front of the kids. And best of luck", "NTA You are providing for your children to the best of your ability. For your ex to think that your new fiancee should pay for your kids to go to a private school is ridiculous, especially since she isn't the one paying for her daughter to attend. If your ex brings it up again, ask her if she wants your fiancee's ex's information and tell her that she should contact him and demand he pay for the private school. (Only if your fiancee is okay with this level of snark.)", "NTA but you could apply for scholarships at the private school if they exist.\n\nIf you can't afford it, you can't afford it. Your ex is reaching by expecting you to somehow have money", "NTA.  Your ex wife is.  Blending families is hard.  Focus on making it easier for your children.", "NTA. Are you doing your best and making your kids feel loved? That's all that matters. Target rags? Does she mean the clothes most people wear? The step kids have a rich dad and that's fine but you aren't  a subpar dad just because you aren't super wealthy yourself.", "NTA!!!!!!!!!!! NTA AT ALL. Your ex wife is. Not only is she the AH, she\u2019s also extremely dumb.", "NTA. But something to think about; If her father is as well to do as you say, this likely will not be the only occasion where Mia has an opportunity your kids do not.", "NTA - sounds like you are doing your best. Just make sure they know that they are loved.", "NTA, also time that your kids learn life is not fair, you are doing the best you can, but some people have more and less than you do.", "NTA, your ex wife is being irrational. Have a talk with your kids and explain to them the situation because it seems like ex wife is filling their heads with the idea that you're treating them different.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The fact of the matter is your kids are the poor relations of their stepsister.  The good news is you do not have to help out paying for fiance's kid.", "NTA. Start setting boundaries with you ex now. This level of entitlement is insane and she is bringing things into the discussion she has no business reaching for. She sounds vindictive and petty because she is bringing the kids into this without any regard to their mental health.\n\nYour fiancees finances are off limits. Your finances are off limits. As long as you meet you financial obligations to your children, you do not owe her any more information.\n\nYou and fiancee should have a sitdown on how to properly protect her assets when you do get married. If ex wife is gunning for fiancee's exe's money now, she's going to go after fiancee when you two get married. Get a lawyer involved in protecting your fiancee if you have to.", "NTA.\n\nThat said if you believe that the private school is a better fit for your children, look into their financial aid options before rejecting it. Most private schools have generous financial aid. My pricey private school had about 50% of students on at least some financial aid, with 20% receiving full tuition coverage.", "Have you actually explained why the kids have different clothes and go to a different school to them?

So far my kids have been understanding but I\u2019m worried about what my ex is telling them.

But I got say, I don't think that's a good situation for your children grow up at ALL and I think this kind of thing is important to think about It before get married. Children with Very diferent class status in the same household is a recipy for disaster...", "NTA, and be careful about this situation.\nWith the way your ex is acting, your co-parenting dynamic can lead to parental alienation.\nThe fact that your kids are saying that you treat them differently, when it's not the case, means that your ex is probably going around putting strange ideas in their head.\nI strongly advise you to sit them down and ask why they told you so, and see if their mother has something to do with it. If you find proofs of possibile parental alienation, act fast to put a stop to it.\n\nAlso, start keeping track of every interactions with your ex. Her wants to compete for your childrens love is worrisome, and I can only see things going worse with her entitled attitude.\nWho knows what she would do, if you decide to have other children with your fianc\u00e9e after marriage (since you call her fianc\u00e8e and not GF, I suppose you will marry each other in the future), to keep your children away from you\n\nGood luck, OP!", "AMEN exactly this is something that must be discuss ASAP because too many blended families have been ruined by one of the kids having a rich parent and the others dobn't it creates a lot of resentment", "The kids are treated differently, though. Pretending that they have the same lifestyle as Mia isn\u2019t going to magically make it so."]}
