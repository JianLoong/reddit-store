Expecting others not to have kids because you miscarried, expecting the whole month or even year to be devoted to your wedding, expecting others not to look good at your birthday parties because they \"are stealing my spotlight.\"  In 60+ years, I've never seen such behavior until recently.", "Your brother is a psycho. Probably smart to keep him away from your wife. NTA.", "...What?  Loss makes people act really screwed up sometimes, but there's no way, once he's cooled down, that he can maintain that you conceiving and his miscarriage are in any way, shape or form related.\n\nAnd if he tries, I'd personally would be done.  If my brother, who was so desperate for a baby, is struggling to conceive despite multiple miscarriages, told me to go have an abortion out of jealousy?  NTA but stop messing around with those two.  There's no way they're not going to treat your child horribly, and given that comment, possibly even try to hurt it.", "NTA and asking your wife to terminate her pregnancy is some twisted, selfish, vile shit.  The fact that they would suggest it means your brother and his wife both need some serious professional counseling.", "NTA\n\nHarold and Ashley are likely grieving. It doesn't excuse the comments, but it does explain them.\n\nYou're not the asshole. But you can be more than that. Write Harold and Ashley a letter.  (Don't call or see them in person because they will not hear what you say out of anger.)\n\nExplain to them that you are sorry you said the comment when you lost your temper, as I suspect you are. Explain to them that you understand they are going through emotional times and that not only do you hurt for their loss, but that you look forward to the day you can be an uncle for a child of theirs too. Follow that with you understand how Erica's pregnancy may unintentionally cause their grief to surface even more. That you understand if they can't share in your joy right now. But that, when they feel comfortable, you want them there being an uncle and aunt in your child's life.\n\nYou're not the asshole at all. What he said was totally out of line. But don't let it fester and get out of control. Grief causes things to be said that you would never fathom.", "NTA. Your brother is selfish as hell. It's awful that him and his wife have had so many miscarriages but that has nothing to do with you and he shouldn't put his emotions out on you.", "Wow...this situation is thorny, upsetting, and wholly the worst that could have happened (arguable...but I want positivity here as Op has enough negative to go around based on this post).\n\nNot only are you NTA I would say you handled that as well as you possibly could.  Who TF would insist someone get an abortion just to assuage their own feelings.\n\nAt the end of the day, your brother is hurting quite badly and directed that anger at you because there was nowhere else for him to put it.  Give it some time.  If he comes to the realization of what he said to you and asks for forgiveness, give it to him.", "NTA\n\nThe moment someone ordered me to have an abortion because they can't have a child themselves would be the *last* time they ever spoke to me. Please take this seriously. It's bordering on a threat. They can't ever be around your child, not after telling you to kill it. What's next? Demanding that you hand the child over to them to raise?", "NTA. His response is completely unacceptable. I get grief makes people say crazy things and act out of character, but his response is totally beyond the realm of acceptable.", "Fake? There\u2019s no way you\u2019re own brother will tell you to abort.", "NTA obviously.  It's insane he thinks your wife is going to abort your wanted child becuase he and his wife are struggling with infertility.  It's very sad and hard what he is going through but it has nothing to do with you choosing to have kids.", "I feel like I need a little more info, but overall, NTA. If you knew they were having infertility and miscarriages I\u2019d hope you were respectful about the announcement toward them in general. It\u2019s really difficult to be going through what they are going through and there are tons of emotions that are hard to express. It\u2019s very situational to them, and they are grieving. Give them time, space, and understanding. It\u2019s absolutely okay to celebrate your pregnancy, but be mindful of their feelings and let them express their feelings and validate them. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d honestly want you to have an abortion or anything like that, it\u2019s just hard to deal with announcements and seeing other people happy and growing a belly when you can\u2019t and have had so much hurt. Just continue to be kind and let them feel feelings.", "NTA but I probably wouldn\u2019t have announced the pregnancy with your brother and SIL around. At least not with them still going through the loss of their unborn child.", "Hahaha NTA\n\nThey do not own procreation", "NTA.  I feel for their loss, I've been there myself and seeing pregnant people was hard, but their loss doesn't dictate your life.  The world doesn't stop for anyone, including them.  They need therapy, and I say this in the most sincere way possible.  This is emblematic of people having a very difficult time coping with their grief.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Expecting it to is unreasonable and unsustainable. If everyone stopped procreating whenever someone they knew lost a child the birth rate would drop way below replacement levels.\n\nTelling you to get an abortion to make him and his wife feel better briefly is unspeakably awful. I hope your brother gets some grief counseling soon, because its turning him into a truly awful human being.\n\nNTA", "NTA - While your brother is hurting deeply, it's unfair of him to assume because he can't have something in life, you shouldn't either.

That's not how it works.", "Nta, he lost his mind", "NTA -  your brother was an AH for even thinking this was appropriate", "NTA. Whoa, your brother crossed a major boundary.

I get that a miscarriage sucks, and it can be incredibly painful to see someone else having a child so soon after, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you get to tell them not to have a kid. I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: you are responsible for avoiding your triggers. It\u2019s not the responsibility of the people around you to walk on eggshells and keep all of your triggers away from you.", "NTA\n\nI'd chalk their crazy response to stress from miscarriage, but tell your brother that if he ever suggests abortion for your child, you will never speak to him again.", "It was an absurd ask that got the response it deserved. There is nothing for OP to apologize about.", "\nNo - Families tell each other they should/should not do major life things all the time.\n\nThere\u2019s  all kinds of reasons a family member will ask you to/tell you you should abort.  Not every pregnancy is a good idea or a safe one, after all.  \n\nFamily will speak up for Both good reasons and bad ones.  \n\nBro obviously had a very bad one here."]}
