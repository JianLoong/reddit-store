She may have felt you'd been bristly or difficult to open up to, but was trying to work toward a more friendly relationship. It's hard to say. \n\nIf she's hanging around with you socially at the party (going around to multiple people with you and introducing you as her friend), it sounds like she may have been trying to help you to socially integrate with others of your coworkers.

Now she's just a slower co-worker so I don't really see your point. \n\n>I wouldn't invite my work friends over to my house, but they're people whose professional relationships I value so I'm willing to put in a little extra effort for them.\n\nThat's you, not me. I agree it should have been done privately but adopting others definitions, I'm not inclined to do that.", "Loyalty is an important aspect of friendship.", "To answer your last question: you've skipped over essentially the same point three times now, so I'll frame it as a pair of direct questions:\n\n1) Is it possible that you're perceived as standoffish or even rude in your workplace?\n\n2) Is it possible that she was trying to help you to integrate?\n\nThe reason I ask these questions is that either of them independently, but certainly both taken together, could help to clarify why she said what she did. Her conduct as you've described it simply doesn't sound like that of someone trying to ingratiate herself to allow her to mooch off of your workplace abilities. If that had been the case, it would have been foolish of her to approach you later to address your comment; she likely would have just kept her head down and tried to continue as before to approach you at work for help without comment on your correction of her characterization.", "Right. Someone \u201cabove you\u201d. Not you, so sit down and stop policing her work. \n\nShe was less \u201cdistant\u201d because she thought your working relationship was friendly. \n\nBut here you go, complaining online because she\u2019s treating you at the level you told her to.", "In her mind, she was treating you like a *work friend*. You made it clear the relationship didn't fit your definition of friend. After you humiliated her she realized it didn't fit *her* definition of friend either. So she changed how she treats you to reflect a plain coworker.", "And I\u2019m not willing to go to prison for the rest of my life for loyalty. I\u2019ll be loyal in other ways but if it involves possibly losing my freedom or my life then I\u2019m not apart of it", "I'd say I'm perceived as somewhat aloof, and considering she's never tried to help me with anything of her own volition, no I don't think that's a possibility. If that was her intention, she didn't communicate it to me. She's never given me any altruistic intentions so why would I assume she's trying to help?", ">Right. Someone \u201cabove you\u201d. Not you, so sit down and stop policing her work.  \n\n\nI didn't", "Sure. I'm fine with that. She wants to do her job less efficiently she's only hurting herself.", "Well you haven't had to go through hell with your friends then. I'm happy I didn't abandon my friend through his false accusations. I could have abandoned him, but that's not what friends do. \n\nSo to call me a friend, that means you expect that level of loyalty from me, that's why it's an important label to me."]}
