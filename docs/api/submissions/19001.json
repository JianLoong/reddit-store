You were used, and your idea not to pursue the friendship any further is quite wise.\n\nNTA", "NTA, they tried to take advantage of you. i'd drop them or at least put some heavy walls up", "NTA\n\nThis person is not a friend.  They are a leech", "NTA.  I would have walked out of the store without the cake.", "NTA... you were being used.

Friends dont take advantage.", "They're Neurodiverse and require extra support.", "NTA. Your \"friend\" knew you were kind enough to go pick up the cake and would reliably pay for it. She specifically used that against you in an attempt to not have to pay for it at all. Considering what you're saying about your neurodivergence, your \"friend\" probably didn't expect you to stand up for yourself at all and then wore you down when you tried until you accepted the bare minimum. I use \"friend\" in quotes because anyone who would use your neurodivergence against you like that isn't a friend at all.", "Sound advice.", "Nta and no you shouldn't pursue this any more.

It hurts and is annoying and discouraging. I\u2019ve vented to my mom so many times over the years that it\u2019s become a way for me to gauge a situation. Like if I spend hours talking to her about one specific thing/situation/person then I need to evaluate if it\u2019s worth keeping around.", "Okay, my thinking is that you're overall NTA because they did spring the cake costs on you unexpectedly. That makes them the assholes. However, I think they may have been feeling slighted because of that cash gift. \n\nRent is expensive. I have no idea where you're living, but where I live in the United States, rent is upwards of eight hundred dollars a month (usually more). If someone gave me twenty dollars towards my rent, I might feel like they were making fun of me, or that they just didn't understand me or my experience. If someone gave me specifically twenty-three dollars, I would feel especially slighted because it sounds like they just took whatever cash was in their wallet without considering my specific needs. \n\nMy advice would be to ask your friend if they felt any tension in your relationship recently. It may help to ask specifically why they expected you to pay half of the cake costs. It might be that they're really struggling with money right now and felt embarrassed to ask for help, and hoped that you might pick up the extra cost as a friend. \n\nIt might not be that they're expecting you to act like a piggy bank\u2014it could just be that there is a misunderstanding or some hurt feelings somewhere that you don't realize.\n\nAll the best", "Why are you such a rude person?", "No typo, I gave the boyfriend $23 in cash because my friend said as a good gift, money would help him with whatever in terms of rent so he could prevent moving in with his supposed abusive mother.", "You're 22. You're still a child. You don't need to say you're autistic to be excepted especially when you're trying. And honestly if you can stick up for yourself mom did a good job.

It's okay to need your damn mom.", "Yes, but she can help you by giving you scripts for talking to people, help drafting your own text messages, NOT directly communicating with your friends.

People will take advantage of others and being on the spectrum can make it hard to see the warning signs, and you will have people who can\u2019t understand you and misinterpreted your intentions but there are also amazing people out there who will accept and help you and immeasurably enrich your life, and these are people you can also help and enrich as well.

I'm terms of nothing wrong with still needing your fucking mom or parents advice or help. Like you people are ridiculous. I wish I didn't think I was so \"grown \" at 22.
