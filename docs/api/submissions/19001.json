They set you up to pay for their cake, without asking if you would be okay to do so?

We didn't pay for it in advance and don't plan to pay you back.\"  You may be a good friend to her, but the reverse isn't true. This cake thing was preceded by guilting you to give a gift to her boyfriend.", "You weren't petty.  Your so-called friends were trying to exploit you financially.  Being a good friend doesn't involve being tricked into forking out money.  You were used, and your idea not to pursue the friendship any further is quite wise.\n\nNTA", "NTA, they tried to take advantage of you. i'd drop them or at least put some heavy walls up", "NTA\n\nThis person is not a friend.  They are a leech", "NTA.  I would have walked out of the store without the cake.", "NTA... you were being used. When people only pay you back partially or unwillingly they are USING YOU\n\nNOT YOUR FRIEND", "NTA, your friend is taking advantage of you. It's not her money to determine how it's used. You should have left the cake there the second they said it's not paid for.", "Your friends treated you like an ATM.  They are not your friends.\n\nYou gave their BF a monetary gift.  Then the purposefully didn't; tell you they hadn't paid for the cake that you were to pick up.

You have every right to be upset at someone trying to take advantage of you, which is exactly what you \"friend\" was doing. This is not how friends treat each other.", "NTA.

If something like this happens again, don't pick up the (cake).\r  \n\r  \nWhen you get there and get asked, \"Where's the (cake)\", say \"It wasn't prepaid.\" If they say you should have picked it up anyway, \"Couldn't.

Or call your \u201cfriend\u201d from the bakery. They can pay with their card over the phone or Venmo you.

Friends dont take advantage.", "They're Neurodiverse and require extra support.", "NTA. Your \"friend\" knew you were kind enough to go pick up the cake and would reliably pay for it. She specifically used that against you in an attempt to not have to pay for it at all. Considering what you're saying about your neurodivergence, your \"friend\" probably didn't expect you to stand up for yourself at all and then wore you down when you tried until you accepted the bare minimum. I use \"friend\" in quotes because anyone who would use your neurodivergence against you like that isn't a friend at all.", "Sound advice.", "Nta and no you shouldn't pursue this any more. They will continue to take advantage of you", "INFO is $23 for rent money a typo? Or did you give a more significant cash gift?", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve had friends like this. It hurts and is annoying and discouraging. I\u2019ve vented to my mom so many times over the years that it\u2019s become a way for me to gauge a situation. Like if I spend hours talking to her about one specific thing/situation/person then I need to evaluate if it\u2019s worth keeping around.", "Okay, my thinking is that you're overall NTA because they did spring the cake costs on you unexpectedly. That makes them the assholes. However, I think they may have been feeling slighted because of that cash gift. \n\nRent is expensive. I have no idea where you're living, but where I live in the United States, rent is upwards of eight hundred dollars a month (usually more). If someone gave me twenty dollars towards my rent, I might feel like they were making fun of me, or that they just didn't understand me or my experience. If someone gave me specifically twenty-three dollars, I would feel especially slighted because it sounds like they just took whatever cash was in their wallet without considering my specific needs. \n\nMy advice would be to ask your friend if they felt any tension in your relationship recently. It may help to ask specifically why they expected you to pay half of the cake costs. It might be that they're really struggling with money right now and felt embarrassed to ask for help, and hoped that you might pick up the extra cost as a friend. \n\nIt might not be that they're expecting you to act like a piggy bank\u2014it could just be that there is a misunderstanding or some hurt feelings somewhere that you don't realize.\n\nAll the best", "Why are you such a rude person?", "No typo, I gave the boyfriend $23 in cash because my friend said as a good gift, money would help him with whatever in terms of rent so he could prevent moving in with his supposed abusive mother.", "You're 22. You're still a child. You don't need to say you're autistic to be excepted especially when you're trying. And honestly if you can stick up for yourself mom did a good job. One thing I notice on this thread is people feel the need to say they are autistic. We are all different. Some more than others that's. All. I'm 32 and still go to my mother. Shame on whoever shamed you for being 22 and still needing mom. It's okay to need your damn mom.", "Yes, but she can help you by giving you scripts for talking to people, help drafting your own text messages, NOT directly communicating with your friends. I think you should think about implementing this in all areas of your life. Support/teaching, NOT do everything for me.", "Learning to stick up for myself and solely for myself without having someone step in is currently a work in progress, but other than that, I do a lot of things by myself without trouble or needing my mother to do it."]}
