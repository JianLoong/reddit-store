I was devastated. \n\nWe were living in a one bedroom co-op apartment that she bought for me. We live in one of the most expensive cities in canada; she did this so we would have an affordable place to live and be able to save. To safeguard the apartment in the event of a divorce, I did sign a promissory note (that basically says I owe her the money for the apartment) that would be called in if my husband were to ever make a claim on the apartment. \n\nAnyways, it\u2019s been a year and we have settled into the house, which is also my childhood home. It\u2019s no McMansion but is a lovely home in a good area etc. we are incredibly lucky as this is not something we ever could have afforded on our own unless we won the lottery. \n\nOnce my mother died, I continued paying the mortgage using the money my mother left me in her accounts (about 70k). There was about 340k left owning between the mortgage and her line of credit. The apartment she bought me was sold to pay this all off. Now there is no mortgage whatsoever. My mother worked incredibly hard as a single parent to achieve what she did; and left a legacy that ensures our family\u2019s future and stability. \n\nTo the issue at hand: we need to draw up wills; we didn\u2019t have them before as we didn\u2019t really have any assets. And now we have our daughter as well. I had gently tried to explain to my husband that in my will, the house would go to our daughter. I feel I t was my mothers gift to me that gives me security and financial independence and that it should go to her next. \n\nI told him that quite frankly I had seen and heard (especially on Reddit here) too many horror stories with blended families. And that as we are young, he is likely to remarry which is fine\u2026but that my mother\u2019s estate is not to go to his next wife (which it would legally once he remarried if I left no will) or to be split with future step or half siblings. The house is for our daughter once she is an adult, and that this is to safe guard that. \n\nHe was PISSED. His exact response was \u201cso I get nothing ?\u201d I said no, obviously various life insurance, pension benefits etc would be his or split between him and our daughter. And I pointed out that if something happened to me or not; he would still be benefiting all this time and able to save money by living in a mortgage free home. And if I died while our daughter was young, that gave him ample opportunity to save a ton of money to get someplace else. \n\n(I would also like to note that he out earns me 3 to 1)\n\nHe still thinks it\u2019s unfair. My family thinks it\u2019s perfectly reasonable and think him feeling entitled is ridiculous as it\u2019s not a house he has ever worked for or paid for. \nSome of our friends think it\u2019s not fair to him. \n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit: first off, didn\u2019t expect such a response.

I'm with you 1000 %.  I wish some of my family members did the same.  Safeguard your mother's legacy and leave it to your daughter.  Your husband is benefiting from living in a house that is paid for, and he should be happy that his daughter's future is secured.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t know about the laws in Canada, but where I\u2018m from, the house would go equal parts to spouse and child(s), so there would be problems either way. In my country it is also the best option regarding estate taxes: If spouse inherits first, he has to pay and then again the children when spouse also dies. To avoid that, most people leave their assets directly to the children. \n\nThere are ways to ensure the right of the spouse to stay in the house, so maybe, to keep the peace, look into those? I don\u2019t know how you presented your case (you gently tried to explain, but then told him frankly), but I would also be pissed if my spouse told me they didn\u2019t trust me to be fair to my daughter. (Again, I nonetheless believe she did the right thing)", "Definitely NTA, but you should sort out some things legally. Think about what you'd want to see happen were you to pass away before your daughter was 18/inheritance age. It's reasonable imo to write into it that your husband can continue to live in the house until your daughter is of age.\n\nAlso check the legality of what you're doing, different states/countries have different laws on what you have to leave to spouses etc.", "I would talk to a lawyer. Sounds like you may want to put the house in a trust to be inherited by your daughter when she reaches a certain age. A trust will provide for more customization. NTA", "Absolutely NTA! It's a brilliant idea to safeguard your daughter's future.", "NTA, please seek legal advice asap - separate from your husband. Your mother worked very hard to provide this for you and you have the right to protect it. I\u2019m not sure what the laws are in Canada so seek legal advice before you discuss anything further, that way you both don\u2019t argue about something that can\u2019t legally happen. Good luck", "NTA. It's not a shared asset, and it's not something you two built up together. Maybe ask him: did he marry you for your inheritance?", "You may want to consult a lawyer .\nTechnically the house is now a matrimonial home and he may have the rights to 50% of it.\nHe could be petty, ask for a divorce and you would have to buy out his share.", "Very sensible and fair, absolutely NTA", "NAH I think that\u2019s a great idea and goes with what your mother wanted for you. It does seem like the other side of protecting your daughter is under the assumption your husband wouldn\u2019t. I can see why he is upset. Draw up the will the way you want and offer counselling to work on the issues of his feelings.", "NTA. 'His exact response was \u201cso I get nothing ?\u201d ' He seems to be missing the part where he has been living rent and mortgage free all this time without having paid anything in, and will continue to do so as long as you're together/you're alive.\n\nHe is getting PLENTY, he's just getting it now as opposed to when you die.\n\nHe should be thrilled at this opportunity to put everything he's saving on rent/mortgage into building savings.", "Yeah\u2026. Sticky spot. Completely  understand why you would want to pass it on to your daughter, but it\u2019s also a bit off to leave your partner homeless. I\u2019d say this is a bit complex and depends on what else he would inherit\u2026 although in saying that.. he earns 3 x what you do. That doesn\u2019t give complete context either as it depends on what you earn as to what type of income he is on.\n\nGiven the info provided and also what is missing, I would make sure that there is a solid clause that he can stay until daughter hits x age. Maybe even 30 - might end up better for her also.\n\nOn another note it sounds like you\u2019re both young so him blowing up seems a bit off\u2026\n\nI would definitely consult with an estate planning lawyer and make your wishes known as well as the nuances that go with that. Don\u2019t rely on anecdotal stories.", "NTA. \nyou are entirely right to leave your house to your daughter in your will.", "NTA. He contributed nothing to the house. Your will is yours to decide. You are leaving it to your daughter not some random person on the side of the street.\n\nI find it strange your husband has such a big reaction.", "Okay I get your reasoning here, but - here's the thing;\n\nIf you die, not only does he lose the woman he loves, but he also gets kicked out of his home.  Also, if he's earning 3 times what you are, how does this work out in the household accounts, and providing for your daughter? You may have provided the house but is he contributing financially in other ways?\n\nThis isn't to say you're wrong. You just really need to work out something better here.", "NTA without a doubt!", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nRight choice!", "NTA. Everything you have stated sounds well thought out and smart.", "NTA", "NTA. Leave it to your daughter. Your mom worked hard to give you a wonderful gift and the least you can do is pass it on to your child.", "NTA your inheritance not his. I would talk to a lawyer on how to set this up. Add her to the house title/deed to inherit upon death. Or a trust not sure so talk to a lawyer about your wishes.", "He's acting like an entitled jerk. I have a house with a mortgage, and life insurance that would pay of the remainder, so if i ever remarried, i would do exactly what you are proposing and leave everything to my daughter. NTA.", "NTA. Protect your daughter. Nothing stopping him from investing in property now.", "NTA. Your mother's house obviously goes to your daughter. Naturally if you, God forbid, were to die before your daughter turned 18, your husband would still have the right to live there as your daughter's guardian.  But it should be legally your daughter's house, in your daughter's name.  This shouldn't be an issue for your husband if the plan is for the two of you to live there for the rest of your lives and your daughter inherits only when she is in her forties or fifties.", "Nta, I am thinking about doing the same. Not because I don\u2019t trust my husband, but he has a bad track record of doing bad investments. I fear for me dying and him selling the house to do whatever. I would not mind him living here until he dies, but I want my child to have an inheritance at some point. I have given this long hard thought. I am actually going to be doing the will at some point soon and I won\u2019t be telling him about it, unlike you. Other trusted family members will have the will. I feel like it isn\u2019t something worth arguing over now in life, so if I die, and I am the B for trying to make sure everyone is financially protected, so be it. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. It is an entirely reasonable thing to do.", "NTA, your husband should be happy his daughter will be taken care of! But here he is, planning for your death and sharing your house with his new family.", "NTA. I have heard of this before. My only ify part is what if you have another child? Are you going to redo the will or will this be accounted for already. In stories on Reddit, it\u2019s usually the man and he has already remarried and the new wife is pissed it only goes to his child, not both new wife and child. So I think it\u2019s very reasonable to do this. If it\u2019s ok for the men to do it, it\u2019s ok for women too!", "NTA\n\nFirst, I am sorry for the loss of both your parents. Second, based on your comments, you are 100% within your rights to will your property to your child instead of your spouse. You want her to always have a home.", "NTA\n\nI wrote my will last year just before my son was born, I have assets in my own right and family wealth to inherit, where as my partner has none. \n\nWe sat down, and I said that if our family home was one of my inherited properties that he would have lifetime enjoyment and if it was a 50% split that my shares would go to our son. \n\nAll of my possession, pension etc will go to our son, and he will not inherit anything. \n\nHe was in complete agreement, and that the future we are building towards is for our child. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, but why should your assets go to your husband? That\u2019s yours, and your mothers hard work, scrimping, saving and blood sweat and tears that went into that property, she did it for you, not for him. \n\nHe should be happy that you want to build a future for your shared child. This is not about him. \n\nMoving forward, I wouldn\u2019t discuss your will with your partner, as it\u2019s you and your business. He can find out if he out lives you.", "You\u2019re doing the right thing and I can find no flaws in your logic.", "Good call tbh, my grandpa has spent his entire life missing out on inheritances because the widow/widower remarried and everything went to the new spouse. Bit sad that you don't trust him to do right by your daughter though.", "NTA, im guessing the house would b win trust for your daughter until she grew up anyway so he would still get to live there with her? It would just mean that you would be sure the house would definitely go to her. it\u2019s something you inherited and was paid for by you mother 100% it\u2019s not like it\u2019s something you and your husband busted your butts to pay off. With all the money you save from paying rent/mortgage you could potentially buy another house down the track or just save a nice nest egg for retirement. Your talking worst case scenarios here. \n\nAlso my husband is on the child side of this, we expect he will inherit nothing from his father because he keeps moving in girlfriends into his house and chances are he will die with a defacto gf who will take everything. Well if he ever finishes getting divorced\u2026. Otherwise she will probably take everything. It\u2019s shitty for him to know his dad just can\u2019t be bothered, since supposedly he wants to leave it all to his kids \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I don\u2019t know anything about Canadian law, but is it possible for you to grant your husband a tenancy for life with the ownership then passed to your daughter? That way, your husband would be able to live in the house until he died if he wanted, but ownership would still ultimately go to your daughter.", "NTA. He is an entitled AH, though. He is benefitting massively from all of this anyway. For him to think he is entitled to your home given to you by your mother, where you have proceeded to continue to put HER money into, is wild. I suggest you draw up that will asap. You should consider protecting those assets should you ever get a divorce too, incase you haven\u2019t.", "I don't think you are out of line, or at least your reasons make a lot of sense.  I am concerned that your husband now feels like he is getting \"nothing\" and is not going to take this well.  \n\nNTA but I don't wish I was in your shoes this holiday season...", "NTA\n\nExcellent forward planning.\n\nYes you are right that should you pass, he would most likely re marry, this is a fantastic way to protect your daughter's future.", "Nta.", "NTA it absolutely should be your daughters and as long as she is needing to be cared for he will still have a home. Why does he feel entitled to something YOUR mom worked so hard for you to have?", "NTA. Your husband is raising a bit of a red flag here. Surely he would still live in the house with your daughter till she comes of age and that gives him plenty of time to save for another house should she want it for herself (awkward situation to have to turf your dad out of his home though) and it safe guards her future which should be his number one priority? The fact that his first concern was, \u201cbut what do I get??\u201d Isn\u2019t a good sign", "NTA. You should have had that prenup. Make sure that there is no way he can claim the house. If he can, assume that he will do what he can to keep the house and not let your daughter have it. You may want to reconsider any money he could inherit just to protect your daughter.\n\nSince you now have no mortgage. Have him save up his money and eventually invest in another home as a purchase. This way, that home can be his.\n\nMay you outlive him!", "And now you know why there was a promissory note on other property.. \n\nOf course your moms house should go to your children.. Agree with you 100%\n\nNTA", "NTA. Protect the child 100%. He\u2019s being unreasonable.", "NTA. Any decent person would be thrilled that their child has a secure future in a very uncertain world. \n\nWhy discuss your will with him anyway - it is called a Will for a a reason!", "NTA - Seems fair, hopefully it won't ever have to be acted upon.", "NTA", "NTA though you need to consult a lawyer immediately. You need to know how to do this - and how not to do it. And I don\u2019t mean just the will. I mean the budgeting (who pays what) for home maintenance and even childcare and healthcare and such. You don\u2019t want to \u2018everyday expense\u2019 yourself into a situation where he can make a claim on the house. Has a lawyer already advised you on this?", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of weird that he\u2019s more worried about what he \u201cgets\u201d if you pass away.", "YTA this is the matrimonial home. I would feel that my spouse and I were not a team of either of us did this with the home we lived in. Set up a matrimonial home somewhere else and rent this unit for your benefit and then pass it to your daughter. That way your husband has some life security. \n\nIf this was cash or rental property inheritance that passed to your daughter it makes total sense though. But I\u2019d soft pedal the blended family stuff when discussing it.", "Neither party is an asshole. You have the right to decide what happens to your property and giving it to your child is a fine decision. However, he is also right to feel what you are doing is unfair. He is now being forced to maintain a house that doesn't belong to him. Any improvements are going to be a big decision for him - should he invest the money and work to something that's not his? Or are you going to be doing and paying for all the maintenance and improvements from your own personal money with no input from him?\nBut the worst part here is that you are showing him that you don't trust him. Which is weird, since you trusted him enough to have a kid with him.\nAt least offer your husband the option to pay for half the house into some fund for the kids. You are still pointlessly erecting financial walls between you two, but  at least it fixes the ownership issue.", "Why not take out life insurance and leave that to your daughter in place of the house?\n\nWhile I get the intent behind what you're doing, it has the potential to make life very difficult for your husband in the event of your passing. A child owning the family home can be an expensive legal tangle as the circumstances and needs of the child and parent change. It also massively affects family dynamics in a way that can negatively impact relationships.\n\nI think there are better ways of safeguarding your daughters future and I think a strategy for safeguarding her should be agreed by both parents together.", "YTA. Your plan is to make your husband bury a spouse and also find a new home. While also putting  your daughter in the position when she may have to navigate the process of evicting your husband.", "NTA. You can let him live in the house until his death, providing your still married to him", "Nta, what is he leaving you? Is it anywhere close to being even? Did he have a home prior as well?", "I don't know which country you are in but I honestly get your point. Nta just misinformed probably. Have you talked to a lawyer? Consider all the possibilities and talk to a lawyer how to make it true. For example, you can leave the property for your kid to live until the kids is 18, then it has to be sold. Or you can leave the usage of the property to your husband until he remarries ( that's legally possible in some countries).", "NTA.\n\nThis is smart for your daughters future. I can understand why he might feel a bit hurt by it initially but he should be able to see your only looking out for her.", "There might be a middle ground here. If you put in the will that in the event of you passing before him, he can live in the house till his passing but the home will be belong to your daughter", "You probably should look at how you word your will so that it's clear he can stay in the house if you die while your daughter is a minor but otherwise NTA.", "Has he paid any of the mortgage?", "NTA", "NTA. PERIOD.\n\nIt's YOUR legacy to pass on to your daughter the same as your mother did with you. Does your husband have any family legacy with monetary value exceeding the daily cost of living by years which he is willing to put to your name in his will? \n\n>Once my mother died, I continued paying the mortgage using the money my mother left me in her accounts (about 70k).

If not then on what basis is he entitled to the property apart from spousal privilege?\n\nThe meaning of will testament does expressly say as per the wish of the testator, so it is your wish for what happens to the house and if you wish it to your daughter then end of story. He has no say in what you wish for in the event of your future.", "NTA, but talk to a lawyer to make sure that your will is properly written to protect your daughter's inheritance. The house is a symbol of your mother's love for you, and your love for your daughter. Your husband does not own it and is not entitled to it. Do not put his name on the deed, whatever happens. He has a well-paying job; he can and should be able to save some money and look after himself in the event that you pass away and he needs to raise your daughter on his own, or if for any other reason he needs to live somewhere else.

I was devastated. \n\nWe were living in a one bedroom co-op apartment that she bought for me. We live in one of the most expensive cities in canada; she did this so we would have an affordable place to live and be able to save. To safeguard the apartment in the event of a divorce, I did sign a promissory note (that basically says I owe her the money for the apartment) that would be called in if my husband were to ever make a claim on the apartment. \n\nAnyways, it\u2019s been a year and we have settled into the house, which is also my childhood home.

And now we have our daughter as well. I had gently tried to explain to my husband that in my will, the house would go to our daughter. I feel I t was my mothers gift to me that gives me security and financial independence and that it should go to her next. \n\nI told him that quite frankly I had seen and heard (especially on Reddit here) too many horror stories with blended families. And that as we are young, he is likely to remarry which is fine\u2026but that my mother\u2019s estate is not to go to his next wife (which it would legally once he remarried if I left no will) or to be split with future step or half siblings.

It\u2019s also an issue that come up multiple times in my own family and my mother\u2019s wider circle of friends.\nThird: yes, (after consulting with a lawyer to confirm) inheritance is exempt from becoming community property; EXCEPT for homes you live in that become the marital home. Then he would have a claim on it. \nFourth: no I did not co mingle any money from the sale of the apartment or any money inherited into joint accounts\nFifth: all taxes, etc have been paid by me. There is money left over from the sale of the apartment that I have invested to be used for any major repairs etc. \nSixth: once our daughter is no longer a minor, I would be redoing my will with different parameters.\nSeventh: thank you all for the suggestions, I will be looking into placing the house into trust. \nEighth: my husband sends me a chunk from his paycheque for expenses that we split like utilities, daughters RESP, groceries, cell bills etc. I\u2019m in charge of paying them all. His pay goes into his own account and he is still left with half to 2 thirds of his pay cheque to do with as he wishes. \nNine: it wasn\u2019t until I put my foot down and basically force marched him to the bank that he set up his own RRSP.

If anything I find the latter accusation more offensive, particularly when her reason isn't *anything* to do with OP's character or behavior in the past. It's because she's read some stories online.\n\nAnd just on the financial side - she says he'd come out ahead from all this time spent living for free in her home, but I doubt their currently taking a *mortgage/rent* sized lump of money on top of their normal savings and stashing it away every month. Honestly, if I were in this position, I'd just start looking for a second property to buy and start paying for it now. Either we trust our spouse to take care of us, or we all have to take care of ourselves - and if it's going to be the latter, he'll do better to buy something now and start making payments today using the money OP is claiming he's saving -- that's *surely* solely his money as much as the house is completely hers. Worst case, it all works out fine and you can sell the other property one day.", "That's a reasonable fear, because it happens all the time.  It happened to my mother and her brother.  They were supposed to get their parents' house, but when Grandpa was dying of cancer, his second wife demanded that he leave it to her or she would divorce him.  He did.  Then when she died she left it to her son from a previous marriage.  My mom and my uncle got almost nothing from their parents' estate.", "Yeah, in their place I would actually do a conditional life tenancy - life estate to husband UNLESS he gets remarried, at which point it goes to child.", "Technically it now belongs to both to you as it is a now a matrimonial home .\nIf you were to try to get a mortgage on the property, your husband would need to sign to allow it", "Personally, I think that looking out for the kid\u2019s surviving parent is part and parcel of looking out for the kid.\n\nI\u2019m not aware of too many 1-year-olds that can fend for themselves, anyway - are you?", "This has happened to a lot of my friends when their parents got older: one parent dies and the other marries very quickly then dies.

One friend just wanted her mother's wedding ring and wasn't even given that.", "Except him having a life estate does put limits on what the daughter can do with the property. She couldn\u2019t sell it without compensating him for the value of the life estate and she couldn\u2019t evict him if she wanted to live in the house herself. He could throw her out when she hits 18 and continue to live there for the rest of his life. This is obviously a worst case scenario, but OP is (rightly) trying to consider worst case scenarios in this process.", "That prevents the daughter from having it as her own. If OP was killed in an accident tomorrow, her husband could marry someone else and live there for the rest of their lives. Would they maintain the property? Would the daughter be comfortable living there? Could she charge rent? Who pays the taxes?", "Can it be limited?  For example, he has the right to live there for five years or ten years or whatever, but after that it goes entirely to daughter?\n\nAlthough the way he's acting now, I'd be concerned he might trash the place out of spite.", "Exactly my thoughts. OP is NTA, but needs to be clearer on how this all works. You're correct in saying that the home would be available to him for use in his lifetime-he cannot sell it, let it out or generally make major changes without the permission of a trustee. Should he die or have to leave the property (for a care home etc) then it reverts to the daughter. And she has the right to live there the whole way through as well. What she couldn't do is say, marry and throw dad out (not that I'm saying she would!)", "As long as she keeps paying EVERYTHING for the house-- and does all of the home maintenance herself , then she's N T A.

If OP and her husband spend the next several decades living together in this house as a family, there are going to be countless repairs/improvements, taxes, and other costs involved, many of which will likely be paid for by the husband while also providing much of the income for the family in general if he earns 3 times what OP does. In the event that they were to divorce, it would be completely reasonable for OP to retain sole ownership of the house and eventually pass it to her daughter. But if it ends up being the case that they remain together until one party dies, and that happens to be OP first, that would be kind of wild for the (potentially elderly) husband to now have to find a new place to live after having spent his entire married life in this house, that he also raised his daughter in, and contributed a lot of money to after OP inherited it, while also working through the grieving process. I think the best scenario would be a will/trust that stipulates that the actual deed/ownership of the house will pass to the daughter/any future children upon OP's death, but that the husband retains the right to live in the house until his death. These situations are possible in the United States, and I would assume Canada as well, and it would be a fair compromise that ensures that OP's mother's wishes are honored, the house stays in the direct lineage and can't be acquired by a future spouse of OP's husband, but the husband also isn't discarded like a bag of dog shit after helping raise a daughter and contributing to the family for decades simply because his wife happened to die before him.", "No AHs but you have to do some further planning.\n\nI get that you want this house to go to your daughter if you die.  You don't want any potential future spouse's of your husband to benefit. \n\nI also get that your husband out-earns you.  I also get that he is living in a mortgage free house.\n\nSo, as an accountant, here are my recommendations:\n\n1.  Get life insurance on yourself that is equal to the value of the house.  Make your husband the sole beneficiary.  That way, IF you should pass, he's inheriting an asset equal to the house's value.\n2. Have your husband deposit a sum equal to at least half of what the mortgage would be, into a savings account each month.  Therefore, if he isn't building equity in a home, he is building a good savings account.\n\nThen, relax.

Make sure if you divorce it can\u2019t go to him either!", "The implications are nearly endless.  So what you're saying is you don't trust your husband to do right by your daughter.  That apparently you'll be funding all home repairs and projects as it doesn't make sense for him to put any money into something that he appreciates no value in.  Sorry...but don't be surprised if this doesn't bode well for your relationship as you've now un-officially told your husband where he ranks in your life.", "NTA.  Your plan makes perfect sense.  Your mom made sure you had a safe place to live - you want to pass that legacy on to your daughter.", "Hmm, I might have to give you a mild YTA. I'm not sure. I feel very uneasy about your attitude to the house, that you're giving him a mortgage-free and rent-free place to live. I think that is underestimating the significance of a person's home. People should feel secure in their home and in the situation you've created, you and your daughter are secure in your home, but your husband is not. I read the part where you said that since your husband isn't paying towards the mortgage, property taxes, or maintenance, that he's able to save for his own real estate, should he want to, but you also said that in your area housing is so expensive that if you didn't have your inheritance, the two of you together would not be able to afford a home. So I think your words are a bit contradictory: realistically, he actually cannot save for a home. So the situation he's in, YOU have a secure home. HE does not. That is a very large inequality of power, status, and wellbeing in your marriage. So that makes me extremely uncomfortable. \n\nYes, I realize that a part of what I said above means that, even if you did not have your inheritance, he would not be able to save for a home, because of the expensive real estate costs. However, I think the key idea here is the inequality. YOU own a home. HE does not. YOU own the home you live in. HE has zero ownership of the home he lives in. Again, it is a very big inequality to have in a marriage. I sort of feel that in a marriage you can weather anything as long as the two of you are in it together. \"We're in the same boat\" kind of thing. But you and he are basically in different boats. Yours is better. How nice for you. \n\nAlso, I think there is something very primal about feeling that one has no security in one's home. So he could stay there until she's 18. My oldest child has turned 18. I am NOWHERE near ready to move out of my home. Saying that he can stay till she turns 18 is not like some big gift. It's a bit of an insult really.\n\nAlso, when you own a home, you don't only have that place to live, it also gives you access to increasing equity over time as real estate prices increase. So again, that's an area where things will improve for you, but not for him.\n\nI am also trying to work out how your joint finances play into this. If I understand correctly, you said you split expenses 25:75, reflecting your unequal salaries. So, he earns more and his greater earnings are being shared with you. But you aren't sharing your greatest asset with him. So that to me seems a little bit like \"What's yours is mine and what's mine is mine\" on your part. Again, if you didn't already own property, you'd be more driven to save together so you could buy together. Again, it just seems like you and your husband are not in the same family almost. You're like roommates with a kid. \n\nI can completely understand that you want to protect your assets from going to a new wife and family if you should die and he should remarry. It's not a lack of trust in your husband, but if you die, your husband remarries, and then HE dies, then the new wife could easily cut your daughter out altogether, and if your inheritance had become mingled inextricably with your husband's assets, then that would be very unjust to your daughter. So I think that's just realism. It's all very well for your husband to say of course he'd protect your daughter but the point is that by then he'd also be dead and powerless to do so. It sounds like you have no living family left so that makes it more urgent for you to feel like you can extend a protective hand over your daughter no matter the circumstances. \n\nThe way you've set things up, I get that you don't want, if you died and your husband remarried, that your daughter would be disempowered. But you've actually set it up so your daughter is in power over your husband. He can remain in his own home, the place he's lived the entire time he was raising her, only as long as she allows. I think that is wrong and disrespectful to your husband. \n\nI think my conclusion is YTA. I think the marital home has such great significance in a person's sense of security and dignity, that having such a profound inequality between yours and your husband's ownership of the marital home is disrespectful and damaging to the marriage.", "NTA\u2014 as someone who trusted a man too much with combined finances and assets, never again.

But if it ends up being the case that they remain together until one party dies, and that happens to be OP first, that would be kind of wild for the (potentially elderly) husband to now have to find a new place to live after having spent his entire married life in this house, that he also raised his daughter in, and contributed a lot of money to after OP inherited it, while also working through the grieving process. I think the best scenario would be a will/trust that stipulates that the actual deed/ownership of the house will pass to the daughter/any future children upon OP's death, but that the husband retains the right to live in the house until his death. These situations are possible in the United States, and I would assume Canada as well, and it would be a fair compromise that ensures that OP's mom's wishes are honored, the house stays in the direct lineage and can't be acquired by a future spouse of OP's husband, but the husband also isn't discarded like a bag of dog shit after helping raise a daughter and contributing to the family for decades simply because his wife happened to die before him.", " Thank you so much. I\u2019m currently researching life insurance. \nMy husband isn\u2019t the greatest with money. I\u2019m the one who set up our daughters RESP.

Wills are to protect the family, not just the spouse. In this instance, the daughter. There also is no sexism here - OP's husband outearns her and is able to do with his money as he pleases (except for paying utilities and being forced to save for himself and his child, which honestly is just giving him a minimal lesson on financial literacy - perhaps he should put more into his daughter's future or his retirement). He's also been living in, without paying towards, housing that has never been in his ownership for the majority of their relationship. \n\nWhat I hear is, \"my Mom worked really hard to give this to me so that I didn't need to struggle.

And we not only have a nice one in a good area, but mortgage free. Our parents had to work their entire lives for something like this. And it should be protected. For example I\u2019m also not having a line of credit or credit cards tied to the house etc. \n\nIt\u2019s an incredible opportunity to have less stress/financial pressure, better work like balance, and a better standard of living.

I\u2019ve worked very hard to make better decisions and be more financially literate. \nI was the one that pushed him to set up his RRSP and TFSA. And suggested he automate contributions to make it easier to save consistently.

Period", "His thinking is probably that you think he's such a poor father that you would need to put in legal writing that he should not get your house because he would not treat his own daughter fairly if he got remarried or had more kids. Its the same reason certain people get angry if asked to sign a prenup, or the same reason people get angry when you reveal you have back ups for then, romantically or otherwise. When you say you have read too many horror stories on reddit regarding things like this, that means you don't trust him enough not to be one, or you wouldn't need a will like that. I'm not saying you're in the wrong, you have every right to do it and it's the smart thing to do, but your husband's feelings are completely understandable at least, if not justifiable. It's a natural human emotion.", "By legal adult, I\u2019m guessing that would mean 18. You\u2019re not required to will it to him, but I can see why he might be angry. Basically the house you live in, where you are raising your family, will never be his home. It\u2019s your home and when you\u2019re gone it\u2019ll be your daughter\u2019s home. He probably feels like that means he is just a guest whose welcome will eventually be worn out. He could have a falling out with your daughter and she could kick him out of his home of 17 year the day she turns 18. They could have a great relationship but then she decides it\u2019s better to sell the house to go to college instead of taking out student loans. He ends up in the unique position that his daughter becomes his landlord- will he second guess any punishment he gives her in case it makes her kick him out one day? Imagine trying to ground a 17 year old and be told \u201cif I\u2019m grounded then you\u2019re out of the house in 3 months when I turn 18!\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m sure he also feels a little like you don\u2019t trust him. You could tell him that when you are gone, you don\u2019t want the house to go to anyone other than your daughter. If he did eventually get remarried, he could get a prenup that says the house is his in a divorce and a will that says it goes just to your daughter. Just because he gets married, doesn\u2019t mean a new wife would automatically get half the house- as evident of the fact that he doesn\u2019t have half the house despite be married to you. \n\nAlso, say you die in a year. He falls on hard time and wants to downsize. Can he sell the house to buy a new place? It belongs to your daughter, he\u2019s just allowed to live there for the next 16 years. \n\nFrom a purely logical standpoint, you\u2019re right and he\u2019s not entitled to anything.

To make sure the house still goes to our daughter in that situation, I\u2019ll just make sure that it\u2019s never actually your house so you legally can\u2019t ignore my wishes for the house to stay in the family\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t know what the solution is but everyone jumping to \u201che\u2019s just greedy\u201d is just assuming the worst.
