I was devastated. \n\nWe were living in a one bedroom co-op apartment that she bought for me. We live in one of the most expensive cities in canada; she did this so we would have an affordable place to live and be able to save. To safeguard the apartment in the event of a divorce, I did sign a promissory note (that basically says I owe her the money for the apartment) that would be called in if my husband were to ever make a claim on the apartment. \n\nAnyways, it\u2019s been a year and we have settled into the house, which is also my childhood home. It\u2019s no McMansion but is a lovely home in a good area etc. we are incredibly lucky as this is not something we ever could have afforded on our own unless we won the lottery. \n\nOnce my mother died, I continued paying the mortgage using the money my mother left me in her accounts (about 70k). There was about 340k left owning between the mortgage and her line of credit. The apartment she bought me was sold to pay this all off. Now there is no mortgage whatsoever. My mother worked incredibly hard as a single parent to achieve what she did; and left a legacy that ensures our family\u2019s future and stability. \n\nTo the issue at hand: we need to draw up wills; we didn\u2019t have them before as we didn\u2019t really have any assets. And now we have our daughter as well. I had gently tried to explain to my husband that in my will, the house would go to our daughter. I feel I t was my mothers gift to me that gives me security and financial independence and that it should go to her next. \n\nI told him that quite frankly I had seen and heard (especially on Reddit here) too many horror stories with blended families. And that as we are young, he is likely to remarry which is fine\u2026but that my mother\u2019s estate is not to go to his next wife (which it would legally once he remarried if I left no will) or to be split with future step or half siblings. The house is for our daughter once she is an adult, and that this is to safe guard that. \n\nHe was PISSED. His exact response was \u201cso I get nothing ?\u201d I said no, obviously various life insurance, pension benefits etc would be his or split between him and our daughter. And I pointed out that if something happened to me or not; he would still be benefiting all this time and able to save money by living in a mortgage free home. And if I died while our daughter was young, that gave him ample opportunity to save a ton of money to get someplace else. \n\n(I would also like to note that he out earns me 3 to 1)\n\nHe still thinks it\u2019s unfair. My family thinks it\u2019s perfectly reasonable and think him feeling entitled is ridiculous as it\u2019s not a house he has ever worked for or paid for. \nSome of our friends think it\u2019s not fair to him. \n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1700635184, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1812whd/aita_for_leaving_my_house_to_my_child_not_my/", "score": 335, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm with you 1000 %.  I wish some of my family members did the same.  Safeguard your mother's legacy and leave it to your daughter.  Your husband is benefiting from living in a house that is paid for, and he should be happy that his daughter's future is secured.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t know about the laws in Canada, but where I\u2018m from, the house would go equal parts to spouse and child(s), so there would be problems either way. In my country it is also the best option regarding estate taxes: If spouse inherits first, he has to pay and then again the children when spouse also dies. To avoid that, most people leave their assets directly to the children. \n\nThere are ways to ensure the right of the spouse to stay in the house, so maybe, to keep the peace, look into those? I don\u2019t know how you presented your case (you gently tried to explain, but then told him frankly), but I would also be pissed if my spouse told me they didn\u2019t trust me to be fair to my daughter. (Again, I nonetheless believe she did the right thing)", "Definitely NTA, but you should sort out some things legally. Think about what you'd want to see happen were you to pass away before your daughter was 18/inheritance age. It's reasonable imo to write into it that your husband can continue to live in the house until your daughter is of age.\n\nAlso check the legality of what you're doing, different states/countries have different laws on what you have to leave to spouses etc.", "I would talk to a lawyer. Sounds like you may want to put the house in a trust to be inherited by your daughter when she reaches a certain age. A trust will provide for more customization. NTA", "Absolutely NTA! It's a brilliant idea to safeguard your daughter's future.", "NTA, please seek legal advice asap - separate from your husband. Your mother worked very hard to provide this for you and you have the right to protect it. I\u2019m not sure what the laws are in Canada so seek legal advice before you discuss anything further, that way you both don\u2019t argue about something that can\u2019t legally happen. Good luck", "NTA. It's not a shared asset, and it's not something you two built up together. Maybe ask him: did he marry you for your inheritance?", "You may want to consult a lawyer .\nTechnically the house is now a matrimonial home and he may have the rights to 50% of it.\nHe could be petty, ask for a divorce and you would have to buy out his share.", "Very sensible and fair, absolutely NTA", "NAH I think that\u2019s a great idea and goes with what your mother wanted for you. It does seem like the other side of protecting your daughter is under the assumption your husband wouldn\u2019t. I can see why he is upset. Draw up the will the way you want and offer counselling to work on the issues of his feelings.", "NTA. 'His exact response was \u201cso I get nothing ?\u201d ' He seems to be missing the part where he has been living rent and mortgage free all this time without having paid anything in, and will continue to do so as long as you're together/you're alive.\n\nHe is getting PLENTY, he's just getting it now as opposed to when you die.\n\nHe should be thrilled at this opportunity to put everything he's saving on rent/mortgage into building savings.", "Yeah\u2026. Sticky spot. Completely  understand why you would want to pass it on to your daughter, but it\u2019s also a bit off to leave your partner homeless. I\u2019d say this is a bit complex and depends on what else he would inherit\u2026 although in saying that.. he earns 3 x what you do. That doesn\u2019t give complete context either as it depends on what you earn as to what type of income he is on.\n\nGiven the info provided and also what is missing, I would make sure that there is a solid clause that he can stay until daughter hits x age. Maybe even 30 - might end up better for her also.\n\nOn another note it sounds like you\u2019re both young so him blowing up seems a bit off\u2026\n\nI would definitely consult with an estate planning lawyer and make your wishes known as well as the nuances that go with that. Don\u2019t rely on anecdotal stories.", "NTA. \nyou are entirely right to leave your house to your daughter in your will.", "NTA. He contributed nothing to the house. Your will is yours to decide. You are leaving it to your daughter not some random person on the side of the street.\n\nI find it strange your husband has such a big reaction.", "Okay I get your reasoning here, but - here's the thing;\n\nIf you die, not only does he lose the woman he loves, but he also gets kicked out of his home.  Also, if he's earning 3 times what you are, how does this work out in the household accounts, and providing for your daughter? You may have provided the house but is he contributing financially in other ways?\n\nThis isn't to say you're wrong. You just really need to work out something better here.", "NTA without a doubt!", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nRight choice!", "NTA. Everything you have stated sounds well thought out and smart.", "NTA", "NTA. Leave it to your daughter. Your mom worked hard to give you a wonderful gift and the least you can do is pass it on to your child.", "NTA your inheritance not his. I would talk to a lawyer on how to set this up. Add her to the house title/deed to inherit upon death. Or a trust not sure so talk to a lawyer about your wishes.", "He's acting like an entitled jerk. I have a house with a mortgage, and life insurance that would pay of the remainder, so if i ever remarried, i would do exactly what you are proposing and leave everything to my daughter. NTA.", "NTA. Protect your daughter. Nothing stopping him from investing in property now.", "NTA. Your mother's house obviously goes to your daughter. Naturally if you, God forbid, were to die before your daughter turned 18, your husband would still have the right to live there as your daughter's guardian.  But it should be legally your daughter's house, in your daughter's name.  This shouldn't be an issue for your husband if the plan is for the two of you to live there for the rest of your lives and your daughter inherits only when she is in her forties or fifties.", "Nta, I am thinking about doing the same. Not because I don\u2019t trust my husband, but he has a bad track record of doing bad investments. I fear for me dying and him selling the house to do whatever. I would not mind him living here until he dies, but I want my child to have an inheritance at some point. I have given this long hard thought. I am actually going to be doing the will at some point soon and I won\u2019t be telling him about it, unlike you. Other trusted family members will have the will. I feel like it isn\u2019t something worth arguing over now in life, so if I die, and I am the B for trying to make sure everyone is financially protected, so be it. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. It is an entirely reasonable thing to do.", "NTA, your husband should be happy his daughter will be taken care of! But here he is, planning for your death and sharing your house with his new family.", "NTA. I have heard of this before. My only ify part is what if you have another child? Are you going to redo the will or will this be accounted for already. In stories on Reddit, it\u2019s usually the man and he has already remarried and the new wife is pissed it only goes to his child, not both new wife and child. So I think it\u2019s very reasonable to do this. If it\u2019s ok for the men to do it, it\u2019s ok for women too!", "NTA\n\nFirst, I am sorry for the loss of both your parents. Second, based on your comments, you are 100% within your rights to will your property to your child instead of your spouse. You want her to always have a home.", "NTA\n\nI wrote my will last year just before my son was born, I have assets in my own right and family wealth to inherit, where as my partner has none. \n\nWe sat down, and I said that if our family home was one of my inherited properties that he would have lifetime enjoyment and if it was a 50% split that my shares would go to our son. \n\nAll of my possession, pension etc will go to our son, and he will not inherit anything. \n\nHe was in complete agreement, and that the future we are building towards is for our child. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, but why should your assets go to your husband? That\u2019s yours, and your mothers hard work, scrimping, saving and blood sweat and tears that went into that property, she did it for you, not for him. \n\nHe should be happy that you want to build a future for your shared child. This is not about him. \n\nMoving forward, I wouldn\u2019t discuss your will with your partner, as it\u2019s you and your business. He can find out if he out lives you.", "You\u2019re doing the right thing and I can find no flaws in your logic.", "Good call tbh, my grandpa has spent his entire life missing out on inheritances because the widow/widower remarried and everything went to the new spouse. Bit sad that you don't trust him to do right by your daughter though.", "NTA, im guessing the house would b win trust for your daughter until she grew up anyway so he would still get to live there with her? It would just mean that you would be sure the house would definitely go to her. it\u2019s something you inherited and was paid for by you mother 100% it\u2019s not like it\u2019s something you and your husband busted your butts to pay off. With all the money you save from paying rent/mortgage you could potentially buy another house down the track or just save a nice nest egg for retirement. Your talking worst case scenarios here. \n\nAlso my husband is on the child side of this, we expect he will inherit nothing from his father because he keeps moving in girlfriends into his house and chances are he will die with a defacto gf who will take everything. Well if he ever finishes getting divorced\u2026. Otherwise she will probably take everything. It\u2019s shitty for him to know his dad just can\u2019t be bothered, since supposedly he wants to leave it all to his kids \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I don\u2019t know anything about Canadian law, but is it possible for you to grant your husband a tenancy for life with the ownership then passed to your daughter? That way, your husband would be able to live in the house until he died if he wanted, but ownership would still ultimately go to your daughter.", "NTA. He is an entitled AH, though. He is benefitting massively from all of this anyway. For him to think he is entitled to your home given to you by your mother, where you have proceeded to continue to put HER money into, is wild. I suggest you draw up that will asap. You should consider protecting those assets should you ever get a divorce too, incase you haven\u2019t.", "I don't think you are out of line, or at least your reasons make a lot of sense.  I am concerned that your husband now feels like he is getting \"nothing\" and is not going to take this well.  \n\nNTA but I don't wish I was in your shoes this holiday season...", "NTA\n\nExcellent forward planning.\n\nYes you are right that should you pass, he would most likely re marry, this is a fantastic way to protect your daughter's future.", "Nta.", "NTA it absolutely should be your daughters and as long as she is needing to be cared for he will still have a home. Why does he feel entitled to something YOUR mom worked so hard for you to have?", "NTA. Your husband is raising a bit of a red flag here. Surely he would still live in the house with your daughter till she comes of age and that gives him plenty of time to save for another house should she want it for herself (awkward situation to have to turf your dad out of his home though) and it safe guards her future which should be his number one priority? The fact that his first concern was, \u201cbut what do I get??\u201d Isn\u2019t a good sign", "NTA. You should have had that prenup. Make sure that there is no way he can claim the house. If he can, assume that he will do what he can to keep the house and not let your daughter have it. You may want to reconsider any money he could inherit just to protect your daughter.\n\nSince you now have no mortgage. Have him save up his money and eventually invest in another home as a purchase. This way, that home can be his.\n\nMay you outlive him!", "And now you know why there was a promissory note on other property.. \n\nOf course your moms house should go to your children.. Agree with you 100%\n\nNTA", "NTA. Protect the child 100%. He\u2019s being unreasonable.", "NTA. Any decent person would be thrilled that their child has a secure future in a very uncertain world. \n\nWhy discuss your will with him anyway - it is called a Will for a a reason!", "NTA - Seems fair, hopefully it won't ever have to be acted upon.", "NTA", "NTA though you need to consult a lawyer immediately. You need to know how to do this - and how not to do it. And I don\u2019t mean just the will. I mean the budgeting (who pays what) for home maintenance and even childcare and healthcare and such. You don\u2019t want to \u2018everyday expense\u2019 yourself into a situation where he can make a claim on the house. Has a lawyer already advised you on this?", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of weird that he\u2019s more worried about what he \u201cgets\u201d if you pass away.", "YTA this is the matrimonial home. I would feel that my spouse and I were not a team of either of us did this with the home we lived in. Set up a matrimonial home somewhere else and rent this unit for your benefit and then pass it to your daughter. That way your husband has some life security. \n\nIf this was cash or rental property inheritance that passed to your daughter it makes total sense though. But I\u2019d soft pedal the blended family stuff when discussing it.", "Neither party is an asshole. You have the right to decide what happens to your property and giving it to your child is a fine decision. However, he is also right to feel what you are doing is unfair. He is now being forced to maintain a house that doesn't belong to him. Any improvements are going to be a big decision for him - should he invest the money and work to something that's not his? Or are you going to be doing and paying for all the maintenance and improvements from your own personal money with no input from him?\nBut the worst part here is that you are showing him that you don't trust him. Which is weird, since you trusted him enough to have a kid with him.\nAt least offer your husband the option to pay for half the house into some fund for the kids. You are still pointlessly erecting financial walls between you two, but  at least it fixes the ownership issue.", "Why not take out life insurance and leave that to your daughter in place of the house?\n\nWhile I get the intent behind what you're doing, it has the potential to make life very difficult for your husband in the event of your passing. A child owning the family home can be an expensive legal tangle as the circumstances and needs of the child and parent change. It also massively affects family dynamics in a way that can negatively impact relationships.\n\nI think there are better ways of safeguarding your daughters future and I think a strategy for safeguarding her should be agreed by both parents together.", "YTA. Your plan is to make your husband bury a spouse and also find a new home. While also putting  your daughter in the position when she may have to navigate the process of evicting your husband.", "NTA. You can let him live in the house until his death, providing your still married to him", "Nta, what is he leaving you? Is it anywhere close to being even? Did he have a home prior as well?", "I don't know which country you are in but I honestly get your point. Nta just misinformed probably. Have you talked to a lawyer? Consider all the possibilities and talk to a lawyer how to make it true. For example, you can leave the property for your kid to live until the kids is 18, then it has to be sold. Or you can leave the usage of the property to your husband until he remarries ( that's legally possible in some countries).", "NTA.\n\nThis is smart for your daughters future. I can understand why he might feel a bit hurt by it initially but he should be able to see your only looking out for her.", "There might be a middle ground here. If you put in the will that in the event of you passing before him, he can live in the house till his passing but the home will be belong to your daughter", "You probably should look at how you word your will so that it's clear he can stay in the house if you die while your daughter is a minor but otherwise NTA.", "Has he paid any of the mortgage?", "NTA", "NTA. PERIOD.\n\nIt's YOUR legacy to pass on to your daughter the same as your mother did with you.

If not then on what basis is he entitled to the property apart from spousal privilege?\n\nThe meaning of will testament does expressly say as per the wish of the testator, so it is your wish for what happens to the house and if you wish it to your daughter then end of story. He has no say in what you wish for in the event of your future.", "NTA, but talk to a lawyer to make sure that your will is properly written to protect your daughter's inheritance. The house is a symbol of your mother's love for you, and your love for your daughter. Your husband does not own it and is not entitled to it. Do not put his name on the deed, whatever happens. He has a well-paying job; he can and should be able to save some money and look after himself in the event that you pass away and he needs to raise your daughter on his own, or if for any other reason he needs to live somewhere else.

He brought in a new lawyer who was able to find a loophole in the divorce decree. We had to pay his wife for 1/2 of the property that she never paid anything on. It was awful, it still makes my MIL very angry. The new wife did not work the entirety of the marriage and pressured him by saying she\u2019d be homeless if he didn\u2019t do this.

He should be putting money aside every month, as if he were paying a mortgage. He'll soon enough have money for a deposit on a house/flat. Then he can get his own property to rent out for now, and move into if his wife dies.", "No. He should not have a right to live there. That functionally would do the daughter out of most of her inheritance and any stability through most of her adulthood, while this way he gets years of mortgage-free living and a chance to invest elsewhere.", "Yes, but if they do not, and is was paid off through her funds and direct inheritance (in Canada a spouse has no claim to the inheritence of their SO) then she could give it to whomever she pleases. He has no claim.", "Yup, he says he\u2019s willing to ease everyone\u2019s feelings but does nothing and now acts like he\u2019s entitled to half the house. Not buying his promise for a second", "Absolutely; that\u2019s fine. Especially as he has no estate and no real savings because a) even with my moms help the cost of living is insane here b) his spending habits. \nMy concern is what I have seen in blended families. A) protecting my daughter\u2019s financial interest but also b) not getting kicked out or pressured out if she doesn\u2019t like the new family", "You are absolutely correct. \u2705", "In many countries even then it doesn't become matrimonial property.\n\nSo according to this law, if you own a house and allow your wife/husband to live in it, they automatically own 50%? Sounds wild to me, funny how laws can be so different. So you'd need a prenup to protect your own house in this case?", "Apparently, OP doesn\u2019t trust her husband to take care of their daughter.", "Personally, I 100% agree. I think a good middle way is a whole-life tenancy but it looks like OP won't consider it.", "Ah yes, because investing in a good future of your minor child, while having a place to live, rent and mortgage free, totally makes you an ATM. Since when being a parent started to equal being a selfish and greedy AH?", "Lol", "Yes it would only be his for his lifetime. So if you died at 60 and he lives till 70 he would have rights to the house till he\u2019s 70 and dies. My family is in the real estate business so I\u2019ve seen this before. I\u2019m by no means a lawyer tho. But if I fully understand, I believe I do, when he died the house would revert to your daughter. Look into it. Might be a really easy solution for all this drama.", "Forgot to answer this part. In life estate you cannot sell the home or anything of that nature. You simply have the right to live there.", "Just throwing this out there\u2026 I have a cousin who got married a couple years ago. He moved in with my cousin when they got married. Her house is paid for and she still charges him rent lol. Some families are just different", "But it's not a regular situation here. The husband doesn't own the house and does not stand to get ownership ever, so I think it's a fair question. \n\nRight now, what's his status when it comes to the house ? Is he a tenant or not ? What are the laws regarding marital housing in case of the divorce ?\n\nFor example, in my country, it does not matter who owns the house, you cannot kick out a spouse before a judge say so. \n\nI think what OP expects him to contribute towards the upkeep of the house is important here.", "[deleted]", "My only question is.. what happens if something happens to you while your daughter is young? Say your husband starts dating in a year or two. Now he gets his own place\u2026 who looks after you daughters empty house until she is of age? Because he most certainly is not going to lift one finger or spend one dime on upkeep after you\u2019ve made it so abundantly clear its not his. (As he shouldn\u2019t)", "So he doesn\u2019t pay for water or electricity or general upkeep?  He lives there and only spends money on himself and maybe food?", "You are giving your daughter tremendous leverage over her father. Teenagers are sometimes rebellious and destructive to eve the best of parents.  16 year old, \"dad can I move my boyfriend into the house?\" \"No honey, you are too young for that\" \"Dad, either Bob moves in, or you move out in 2 years\"  \n\nSo him re marrying isnt the only risk to consider.", "Thank you ! That\u2019s exactly what I think", " That\u2019s exactly my thinking. Even putting a modest amount aside each month builds to a nice nest egg quickly. \nAnd hopefully he never needs to use it", ">It's not really a house for her child to inherit and live in if her dad lives there for the rest of his life.\n\nIt's most likely though that both her parents will live another 40-50 years so in all probability she's not going to inherit the house until she's in her 40s.", "Depends whose name it\u2019s in and if he can show he\u2019s contributing to the home. If she dies in say 10 years, and he\u2019s paid taxes and insurance and maintenance etc, he has a claim on that house", "I know it's different everywhere, but we have a living trust that in the event of one of our deaths protects our individual portion of the estate from a blended family situation with a financially responsible third party to weigh in on potential distributions from the estate. The latter is true too if our children are younger than 26, so they don't make dumb and irresponsible financial decisions.", "Awwww thank you \ud83d\udc95", "So you think he's entitled to live in a home completely free that he didn't pay for?  Every rental includes the cost of upkeep, maintenance, and taxes plus any mortgage outstanding.  Everyone is paying for the eventual new roof, plumbing, new flooring, paint etc no matter where they live."]}
