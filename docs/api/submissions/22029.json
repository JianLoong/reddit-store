{"id": 22029, "submission_id": "14xpgkk", "title": "AITA for not eating cake that I knew I wouldn't like?", "selftext": "To start off, a little background. I was diagnosed with autism a few months ago, but I've displayed traits of neurodivergency since I was a little kid. One of these traits was a major dislike of certain tastes and textures, as well as not always behaving accordingly in certain social situations.  Not alot of my extended family knows bc I don't see them very often bc they live towards the North East of the country while I live down in the South East.\nSo, now, on with the story.\nI, 17F, was at a family gathering with my extended family a few days ago. It was a big get-together with lots of different food and drinks. Around 5pm, a massive cake was brought out for everyone. It was a sponge cake, topped with whipped cream and various fruits. I knew I wasn't going to eat any of the cake bc whipped cream, strawberries and raspberries(which were on the cake) are some of the foods that agitate my sensory issues. I said out loud that I wouldn't like any and began to walk away. My cousin called after me and said that she worked really hard on it and it would be really disrespectful if I didn't even bother to try it. I tried to explain that I couldn't tolerate certain textures because of my autism, she said I was making up excuses and that I'm \"perfectly normal\" and just \"attention seeking\". I brushed her off and left the room and just chilled in the living room for a while. My mom took my cousin's side and said what I did was selfish and that I was using my \"disorder\" as a get out of jail free card. I went non-verbal until the next morning, and then that afternoon we drove home, where my mom grounded me for 2 days for how I treated my cousin.\nSo reddit, did I deserve my punishment? Am I The Asshole?\n\nEDIT: Just to clarify a few things\n1. When I say I spoke out loud, it wasn't like I yelled and then stormed off. I saw the cake and I said to myself \"oh I don't want any.\" but it was a little louder than when I usually talk to myself and my cousin must've overheard.\n2. I didn't see the cake until it had been in the room for maybe 10 minutes. This is because the cake was set on a table in the corner of the room and people were crowded around it taking slices. When I got a chance to take a piece I realised I didn't want any.\n3. I didn't get up from a table and storm out of the room. We were all standing around the room and eating off paper plates. When I realised I didn't want any cake I just set the paper plate down , casually turned away and walked out of the room. ]\nAlso thank you to the people who informed me on the difference between being non-verbal and having selective mutism. I usually become unable to speak when I'm stressed, angry, embarrassed or upset and it's takes a while for my voice to come back and I know now that's called selective mutism.", "created_utc": 1689170548, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xpgkk/aita_for_not_eating_cake_that_i_knew_i_wouldnt/", "score": 5361, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your Mom was 100% correct; autism is not a get-out-of-jail free card to start acting bratty and entitled. You're clearly developing Main Character Syndrome and you need to nip it in the bud now before you start to alienate everyone who cares for you.\n\nWhat I will say though is that, \"No means no\" applies to everything in life, to include food.

Only once did someone insist that I take it with me. I gave it to my nephew, out of the site of the cake giver. I think OP's relatively new diagnosis, is driving her to speak up. She needs to learn how to handle things.", "YTA\n\nWhy did you had to say out loud you won't be eating any? Just keep it for yourself and don't take any. No needs to tell everyone.", "YTA. Aside from the absurd fact that every other postet on this sub happens to be autistic and neurodivergent, announcing out loud you won't be eating it is rude.", "YTA\nSounds like you made a scene by standing up and walking away over a piece of cake, so of course it looks attention seeking.\nWhen offered a slice you could have said your sensory issues wont allow for it, but if the cousin insists, get the slice and play with it, fake eating it.. sometimes you have to do things you dont want to please other people, you could have thrown half of the slice in the bin discreetly and said how nice the cake was.", "YTA for making an announcement that you wouldn't like it.

Even better if you can compliment her hard work.  If they ask you why, you can just follow up with \"I'm just not feeling like cake right now, maybe later.\"  Then, later never comes, and you don't have to do the sensory thing, and they can pretend you were going to, and everything is fine.", "YTA. You need to learn strategies to move through the world. Just because you are autistic it doesn't mean that you get a pass on the social norms. It's time to learn ways to react to these situations with style and grace.  Don't say this stuff out loud. Just leave the room. Or - take a small piece and push it around the plate. Before going to parties, think about the situations that might come up and what you might say or do.  At a party, the host has a role and the guest has a role. The host was rude and wrong to press you on eating the cake. You should have told her that the cake looked great and you see how much she worked on the cake but you can't eat it.  \n\nAlso - your mother. You two need to get on the same page.

It's OK not to want a piece of cake, that isn't disrespectful. So the part about being loud has me in the dark if OP could have been percieved as the cousin claimed attention seeking, don't saying that was OPs intent. I can understand the cousins disappointment that OP wasn't even trying the cake, but as I said, not wanting a piece of cake isn't disrespectful and doesn't need to be explained, although it can help to understand that's not the bakers fault. The cousin is at fault for throwing the accusations at OP, no questions about that. OPs mother saying that OP is using her disorder as an get out of jail card, seems seems harsh, but I can see that being done. As I said this is hard without having witnessed the situation, all the non verbal communication etc.  \nSo it is possible that OP did interact better than I assume, but it won't really change the outcome. OP saying she was loud, has me believe she could have handled the situation better, lacking a little finesse in communicating but that doesn't make her an asshole, it doesn't make her attention seeking.   \n\n\nSo it is a NTA!", "Soft YTA, It sounds like you made a scene there by making this so much a bigger deal than it needed to be.

There was no reason for you to loudly announce that you would not be eating the cake because you just knew you would not like it.

Folks don\u2019t like accepting that someone has it if they look \u201cnormal\u201d (read: not a pale white boy). I get the impulse to just explain honestly, but it seems that it\u2019ll just cause more friction in your family because they feel entitled to a justification of your diagnosis. They\u2019re not, but you were diagnosed later in life, so it is an adjustment to how they see you. If you don\u2019t like certain ingredients, maybe next time it\u2019ll go over more smoothly to say that. Everyone has foods they don\u2019t like, so it\u2019ll be something they can relate more to. It also seems your cousin/family might\u2019ve been offended by you announcing this loudly and in front of everyone\u2014maybe tell your cousin/whoever cooks in private next time, because the person who made it is the only one who needs notice. \n\nFood has social importance, especially when it\u2019s homemade, so it makes a sense that your cousin would be hurt if you wouldn\u2019t eat her food based on a reason she doesn\u2019t understand. Her misunderstanding this time is her fault, not yours, but it\u2019ll help everyone if you can initiate a conversation with her about it so that she knows it was never an issue with her or her cooking, she just made something you can\u2019t eat. \n\nBest of luck OP.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This led to me legitimately not even knowing what I liked or didn't, because I was so influenced by the need to be \"polite\". \n\nOthers would have expected OP to first acknowledge the hard work involved in making/assembling the cake she knew she didn't want to eat. Then they expect a fancy dance of either compliments or \"reasonable\" excuses as to why she couldn't eat it. Being full of food, or not wanting to take \"what looks like a delicious cake\" away from others' opportunity to enjoy it are generally considered acceptable. If you're lucky, NTs will also respect if you have a food allergy that prevents you from eating it, but oNLy if you express admiration and regret for their efforts, and your lack of ability to \"join in\"; which is also silly to me, because being disingenuous would acTually be more \"attention seeking\", as it may lead to someone searching for an alternative for you (no cake? Perhaps you'd like some fruit with ice cream, then)\n\nI might get downvoted for this, but in my experience, neurotypical folks expect a whole song and dance. \n\nAllow them to present you with item- food they prepared, a gift, etc. THEN you must compliment the item/the emotional labor they used in selecting the gift, or making the food. (Wow! That cake is so beautiful! /Wow! I've never had a bomber jacket/sundress/blue suede shoes before! You must have gone to a lot of trouble to find this! Where did you get it, if you don't mind my asking?) THEN, you *might* be able to assert s boundary/ communicate a sensory issue- but be prepared for their hurt feelings and protest. (I'm actually full of food already, thank you sO much, but it wouldn't be right for me to take a piece when I know I can't finish it//) then if more protesting -Well, I do also have some sensory challenges that make it difficult for me to eat ___ (whipped cream, berries with seeds, spongey cakes, etc)... OR, Gosh, this is such a lovely jacket/dress/pair of shoes, but placement of tags/ fabric/ style of shoe does not actually suit me--- then be prepared for them to call you an asshole. \n\nLegitimately *by default* if you deviate from the common opinion (WHAT A GOOD CAKE/ WHAT A LOVELY JACKET/DRESS/PAIR OF SHOES), the neurotypical folx will often believe that your deviance from public/ common opinion is in fact a *criticism* of their own opinion, and that you are \"singling them out\" at best, or \"attention-seeking\"/ \"being an inconsiderate asshole\" at worst. \n\nIMO, OP is NTA, and her mother is for punishing her... But once again, from the lense of NT folx, OPs behavior was \"rude\" and reflects \"poor understanding of social cues\", which reflects \"poor upbringing\", which reflects on her mother. \n\nThe entire thing is a GD song and dance, and unfortunately I'm not sure there would have been a proper solution to this issue... Except for once again, being disingenuous- accepting a slice of cake, chopping it to small pieces and pushing it around on the plate but not really eating it... Although if someone *sees* you not eat it, you'll be in danger of being accused of wastefulness... And in the instance of textural issues with clothes, you're legitimately often expected to just *accept the gift*, and also write a thank you card, and do the whole thing, even if you know you'll never wear the item, or if looking at or touching at it physically makes your skin crawl because *it's the thought that counts*, and even if these folx struggle to *think* about the textural or sensory limits of their autistic/neurodiverse associates, pointing out their lack of knowledge or respect for the sensory issues *makes them feel bad* and is therefore *rude*, and in NT world, *rudeness* is a serious offence, and indicates *your* lack of care for *them*. \n\nSo basically- compliment the cake *first*, imagine what they might like to hear about how pretty it is, or how delicious it might look to others. Then, if you're lucky, *privately* (so as not to hurt their feelings) tell them you won't be sharing any cake \"but it's nothing personal, it looks lovely, I'm sure many others will enjoy it\", and hope they don't turn it into an issue... And when it comes to gifts, accept them even if you don't like them and want to chuck them in the bin, compliment the time/thought they might have used to put into selecting of said gift, write a thank you note after to further express gratitude, and then maybe get rid of the item/ dodge the cake. \n\nI'm sure a handful of folx may take offense to my wall of text here, but I'm hopeful it may at least be helpful to other autists, who seem to struggle in comments a bit here, and I want to prevent others arguing/having misunderstandings as much as possible. \n\nGood luck, everyone.

I don't think that's the issue, The issue is how you went about it, and how they responded.   \nAs an autistic person who has struggled with social nuance myself, I'm going to explain this as such. Neurotypical people and autistic people speak two totally different languages. Most of us don't do subtext, we say exactly what we mean, to the letter, and just generally don't deliberately imply things. Neurotypical people have this whole language of subtext and implications. They often don't say what they really mean, and expect you to get the hint, and likewise, they think we're hinting at stuff when we're not, because they assume we do what they do. This is what happened here, and this is probably going to cause you to have miscommunications throughout your life.\n\nAn acceptable course of action with the cake would be to have stayed quiet until you were offered a piece, then declined with something complimentary and polite like \"Your cake is really pretty, but I have to pass\" or even a simple \"no thank you\" would have sufficed.   \nAs for your family - yeah they suck here too.

PLENTY of people do not like fruits in desserts. hell, i'm a grown ass NT adult with very few pickiness in my eating and i even don't like certain frosting/whips on cakes. and i can tell what by looks what ones are going to not be my taste. if someone doesn't like raisins in their butter tart, or nuts in their banana bread, pineapple on pizza, is it the end of the fucking world? people who have tasted things before and know they don't like it should be allowed to recognize an ingredient and say \"i would not like any of that because i don't like x.\" if you want to add the ND back in the equation here, OP is particularly aware of their preferences and sensory issues, they can trust themselves when they see a fruit cake and whipped cream and think, \"i do not like to eat these items together, i would not enjoy tasting that or having that texture in my mouth.\" trust OP when they say they don't enjoy a certain food and understand that everyone has these things they like and don't like.\n\ncousin or literally any other person who may cook or bake for ANYONE, ANYWHERE, has to accept that they will not get 100% takers and 100% enjoyment from whom they serve. people have food preferences. OP gets grounded for not eating cousin's cake, essentially. like, how old is this cousin? another teen/very young adult? hounding someone to try or force them to eat something you made is pretty weird behaviour IMO. i brought a cake to work the other day and made sure everyone knew it was there, and like 6 people said they already ate their lunch, or were on a specific diet, or just didn't want it. i didn't fucking chase them down and ask why or what was wrong with it or anything. i don't feel \"disrespected.\" it's a fucking cake. you all seem to be hellbent that saying \"i wouldn't like that/any\" is the rudest fucking thing and it's the same as someone kicking your dog in front of you unprovoked. OK, everyone has different limits on what they find acceptable, but this seems really sensitive. even when OP provided an explanation, they were met with nonsense disregarding her diagnosis and basically told it wasn't real (\"making up excuses, OP is 'normal'\"). cousin was ruder than OP.\n\nmost of this thread is people upset that a ND person doesn't know how to tell a white lie and smile and nod. try to understand autism better before you blow your load on OP about how people are supposed to act in certain circumstances. again, even if we remove the ND part, they're pretty young and inexperienced in life. people learn how to communicate better with time and varieties of experience.\n\nforcing children to eat things they don't like is weird. plenty of us were forced to sit and clear our plates and shit, it can cause disordered eating and bad relationships with food. yes OP is 17 but, the extreme consequence of grounding someone for not eating something is a weird exercise in control. parenting has got to change in this regard. another discussion for another day.\n\nfeels like people get their \"what normal social expectations are\" rules from mean girls. people want OP to learn how to regina george their way through life and tell the cousin \"omg i love your cake that's the most beautiful cake i ever saw except i'm on a diet\" and THEN mutter \"that's the grossest looking fucking cake i've ever seen.\" lol", "i don\u2019t understand the people on this post? lying and not saying anything i feel woupd have been worse? what if the cousin directly asked? what if they were cutting slices? i have texture issues being on the spectrum with frosting and whip cream. at parties people will offer me cake and i have to politely say no. it\u2019s hard, because it\u2019s rather hard to get my tone across correctly often but what?? am i meant to eat the cake and trigger a meltdown?? op knew they couldn\u2019t eat the cake, if op had an alleergy you wouldn\u2019t have called them rude. it\u2019s the same thing they physically can\u2019t eat it. nta maybe ur tone could have been nicer but it\u2019s hard sometimes", "The ableism here is astounding!", "NTA, loving the ableism and assumptions in this thread", "You are NTA.

That's fucked up to the point of abuse if it carries over into other areas of life, and based on the conversation and punishment afterward, I bet it does.\n\nWait, the ADDITIONAL problem is that the baker and the mother didn't believe her that she has serious problems with texture, as if tasting a fucking piece of cake that he *didn't* have autistic issues with was somehow something that she would so strongly and maliciously refused to do, that she would go out of her way to draw attention to herself about it, withstand an argument, isolate herself for an evening, then not apologize and get grounded.

And for someone who struggles constantly for unknown reasons, as neurodivergent folks often to OP extra does not need pressure to go against their instincts and needs.\n\nFor all we know OP's sensory issues actually help her avoid things that upset his stomach. *Autistic people rarely understand their own bodies* and have unusual trouble explaining things they don't understand, and this probably helps OP stick to safe, comfortable foods. Regardless, NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO TELL HER TO PUT ANYTHING IN HIS BODY.\n\nOP's family are callous assholes who are weapons OP's differences to force her to suppress his unique needs, stop being inconvenient, and be a nice little playing piece in THEIR ideal game of Life. Fuck that. They need to learn to understand and have compassion for her needs and uniqueness, which they clearly don't understand based on the fact that they couldn't get over their butthurt and drop it even though it was *the exact opposite of being a personal issue about them*.\n\nIt would have looked way worse for the baker if OP took a slice, \"politely\" tried a bite, tried to suppress their natural gag and face contortions, then left the rest on the plate. They'd be lucky if OP didn't involuntarily spit it out. OP tried to politely tell others they \"would not like any\" (which is considered a very polite refusal in the US, but here it was autistically misdirected at the room rather than the server) and to let others enjoy the social ritual that she was unable to comfortably participate in. Then she was accosted *at the party, in front of everyone, apparently* and punished.

As a result, significantly more people are realizing that they identify with the symptoms, behaviors, and thought patterns being described, and are seeking diagnosis. In prior generations, mental health in *any* capacity simply was not talked about. Autistic people were seen as either alien, Rain Man-esque geniuses or nonverbal idiots with no in-between. Autism wasn't actually understood beyond \"it's weird\". The spectrum of severity and \"symptoms (for lack of a better word) was nonexistant.

You didn't say you thought it looked nasty. You just said you would not like any. I have said this to myself before without getting attacked for it (I am not on the neurodivergent scale, just something I do from time to time). \nI think it is rude of your cousin to have pushed so hard for you to try it. They called attention to your comment to yourself and then made it weird. \nI have a sister who bakes, and she does not force people to eat it. If I say I won't be eating it, it isn't a comment to her baking skills. I LOVE when she bakes. I just have personal tastes as well that are specific to me.\n\nYour mom accusing you of using your autism to get out of eating cake is also bizarre. You have tried these things before, so you know you can't handle the texture. Your mom probably has things she also won't eat because she can't handle the texture or taste. I won't go near bread pudding or flan. The texture is unpleasant to me. When my sister makes it, I'm not going to even try it. A friend of mine won't eat meat off of bones because it freaks her out. Most people have food nuances that they can't tolerate. It is not a comment on the people who prepared the food. It is how it is.", "NTA in my opinion. I can imagine that is was more like a thought that was voiced but accidentally the volume was higher than intended.

OP literally just left the room not shouting their disgust or anything into the room, not making faces of disgust and not rolling eyes dismissively. Then OP cousin hounded after her and asked her, which is a fair response imo. However, she gives you an explanation for why she doesn't want to eat the cake. No she shouldn't be made to think up some random reason to cradle to your fragile ego. You have a right to be disappointed by the answer but you sure as hell don't get to dictate the validity of her opinion either. Op told her cousin why and because they and apparently many on this post do not see their reasoning as sufficient, they put emotions into something that didn't even target them. It's not disrespectful to decline food. If the cousin and the mother take offence by something that literally wasn't even targeted towards them, that's a problem they have to face instead of gaslighting OP.  I will never understand why people falsely attach emotions to facts especially when it's not even about them. Again this is my opinion. I can understand that people have different views and different experiences which shape their understanding of such situations and how one is supposed to behave.

Then, when offered, compliment and decline softly: \"That looks beautiful, thanks so much for offering, but I'm chillin for now\". Then, if they press you on it, go about explaining your sensory issues and walk away as you did if they are rude to you like your cousin was.\n\nI grew up with an Autistic step brother and his autism was pretty severe(? Right word? No offense intended, please let me know if that's the wrong term). So I def understand sensory issues and coming off as rude. He was a sweetheart but had his moments and didn't understand lots of social interactions. His Mom was horrible about it and would often punish him instead of educate and help. I will never forget how awful she was, how sweet he was, and how much progress he made when my siblings and I would try to teach him how to interact with people kindly. \n\nFast forward to adulthood, and one of my dear friends is on the spectrum. I love him to death, and sometimes he can seem a bit blunt or uncaring, but we understand why and when it happens, we either let it slide if it's minor or gently let him know what's good if it's a bigger issue. Sometimes he needs to be reminded about things we've discussed previously, and that's okay too.\n\nI am not on the spectrum and I be doing shit that's socially awkward all the time. Of course, I try to stay aware but shit happens, I come off as rude, I learn and apologize, and then adjust my behavior for next time. I think you might contact your cousin and apologize for coming off rude about the cake, but set some boundaries about the way they talk to you about being on the spectrum because that was not cool. And idk your relationship with Moms, but she should understand that punishment like this is not the way- if you can talk to her about that or have another, caring and understanding, trusted adult do it for you, that's where I'd start. \n\nSo... your behavior BEFORE your cousin disregarded your explanation was a bit rude but don't sweat it, just try to use it as a learning experience and log how to respond next time.

Don't let people tell you otherwise. Poor social skills is literally one of the diagnostic criteria for autism. Your family needs to come to terms with this and stop pretending you're a normal kid. You're not. Normal kids want cake, even if it's a gross sponge cake topped with sad whipped cream", "Hi, I think this is maybe what caused the uproar. I'll quote it.

The part that may have ticked people off is just announcing it is all, then wandering away from the celebration. From your perspective, you were just letting them know not to cut you any.

She should have known *by now* how you act in situations like this. \ud83e\udd37.

I can see someone really wanting everyone to enjoy their cake but to escalate to that point, she's the attention seeker not you. Neurotypicals do a lot of projecting. And then all you did was try to explain exactly logically why you didn't want it, probably hoping she would respond like \"oh that makes sense ok I didn't know\". It was their problem for not just accepting it, besides even if you didn't have autism but still didn't like fruity cakes people need to understand that they can't please everybody ffs.

You're 17 too like wtf you're nearly an adult she should be respecting your boundaries and decisions more not treating you like a stubborn picky eating 5 year old. You know what you like and don't like by now and so do they with their own preferences so why is it so much worse when you decline? Because you're the officially abnormal one and thats enough permission to pick on you, thats why. \"Dad didn't eat the potato salad that aunt whoever made\" \"yeah so?\"  \"OP won't eat the cake\" \"OH MY GOD SO DISRESPECTFUL\"\n\nIdk why so many people in this thread seem to think politeness equals kissing ass to never offend anyone.

Op will have a harder time navigating those situations than NT people and so it's all the more important to learn where white lies or distracting truths can be implemented to navigate a difficult situation.", "If you put a lot of work and effort on something related to your special interest and went to share that with your family, you'd be hurt if they sneered \"I don't like that\" and left the room, negating the time and effort you went through to make something to share and improve the celebration with them.\n\nGiving a vague compliment without commiting to eating the cake acknowledges the time, effort, and emotion the other person contributed.  Those have value, and recognizing the gift matters to the person who has made that effort.  It communicates appreciation without intent to participate.\n\nSince no human is a mind reader, all emotional communication is a form of charades.  I can't transmit my emotions to you nor can I ever perfectly interpret yours.  I can only improve my communication skills to better understand the people around me.  Getting mad that other people can't always perfectly translate complex emotions into simple words for you doesn't always reveal a fault on their part.  It can also reveal a lack of patience or interest on yours.\n\nOther socially acceptable responses to a situation like this include \"I can see how hard you worked on this.  It must have taken a lot of time, and berries are so expensive right now.\"\n\nAnother response \"Oh, none for me, thank you!  I am having some more of XYZ, but Wow!  You really went all out on this.\"\n\nYou don't have to lie, and it's better if you don't, but a decent person acknowledges the effort someone makes to contribute to an event for your benefit, even if it wasn't perfect or not your preference.  You can acknowledge the work and affection offered by a loved one without eating food.  You can express appreciation of them and communicate your affection for them too.\n\nGiving silent treatment and refusing to interact with someone/leaving are also things people do to show how much they dislike someone.  Selective mutism isn't the same as giving the silent treatment, but for someone who doesn't see OP often because she lives hours away from her, it would be very difficult to know the difference, especially when the rest of the family claims OP doesn't have the neurodivergencies they do", "No she said she said it aloud to herself and her cousin must have overheard.

I have a similar reaction if I try to eat more food when I'm at capacity, no matter how bad I want that bite my body rejects it and out it goes. \n\nIf I know I shouldn't try something because this might happen I decline. I shouldn't have to explain why I don't want to try something. Isn't it rude if I have to say no, this will cause a vomit reflex, sorry, in order for people to leave me alone?
