I was diagnosed with autism a few months ago, but I've displayed traits of neurodivergency since I was a little kid. One of these traits was a major dislike of certain tastes and textures, as well as not always behaving accordingly in certain social situations.  Not alot of my extended family knows bc I don't see them very often bc they live towards the North East of the country while I live down in the South East.\nSo, now, on with the story.\nI, 17F, was at a family gathering with my extended family a few days ago. It was a big get-together with lots of different food and drinks. Around 5pm, a massive cake was brought out for everyone. It was a sponge cake, topped with whipped cream and various fruits. I knew I wasn't going to eat any of the cake bc whipped cream, strawberries and raspberries(which were on the cake) are some of the foods that agitate my sensory issues. I said out loud that I wouldn't like any and began to walk away. My cousin called after me and said that she worked really hard on it and it would be really disrespectful if I didn't even bother to try it. I tried to explain that I couldn't tolerate certain textures because of my autism, she said I was making up excuses and that I'm \"perfectly normal\" and just \"attention seeking\". I brushed her off and left the room and just chilled in the living room for a while. My mom took my cousin's side and said what I did was selfish and that I was using my \"disorder\" as a get out of jail free card. I went non-verbal until the next morning, and then that afternoon we drove home, where my mom grounded me for 2 days for how I treated my cousin.\nSo reddit, did I deserve my punishment?

Your Mom was 100% correct; autism is not a get-out-of-jail free card to start acting bratty and entitled. You're clearly developing Main Character Syndrome and you need to nip it in the bud now before you start to alienate everyone who cares for you.\n\nWhat I will say though is that, \"No means no\" applies to everything in life, to include food.

Only once did someone insisted that I take it with me. I gave it to my nephew, out of the site of the cake giver. I think OP's relatively new diagnosis, is driving her to speak up.

Even better if you can compliment her hard work.  If they ask you why, you can just follow up with \"I'm just not feeling like cake right now, maybe later.\"  Then, later never comes, and you don't have to do the sensory thing, and they can pretend you were going to, and everything is fine.", "YTA. You need to learn strategies to move through the world. Just because you are autistic it doesn't mean that you get a pass on the social norms. It's time to learn ways to react to these situations with style and grace.  Don't say this stuff out loud. Just leave the room. Or - take a small piece and push it around the plate. Before going to parties, think about the situations that might come up and what you might say or do.  At a party, the host has a role and the guest has a role. The host was rude and wrong to press you on eating the cake. You should have told her that the cake looked great and you see how much she worked on the cake but you can't eat it.  \n\nAlso - your mother. You two need to get on the same page.

Say \"no, thank you\" if someone offers you a slice, and sit at the table with everyone while they have a family event.", "NTA, because you didn\u2019t realize that announcing you wouldn\u2019t like the cake was rude and also stupidly called attention to the fact that you weren\u2019t going to eat any, provoking them to make an issue of it.

It's OK not to want a piece of cake, that isn't disrespectful. So the part about being loud has me in the dark if OP could have been percieved as the cousin claimed attention seeking, don't saying that was OPs intent. I can understand the cousins disappointment that OP wasn't even trying the cake, but as I said, not wanting a piece of cake isn't disrespectful and doesn't need to be explained, although it can help to understand that's not the bakers fault. The cousin is at fault for throwing the accusations at OP, no questions about that. OPs mother saying that OP is using her disorder as an get out of jail card, seems seems harsh, but I can see that being done. As I said this is hard without having witnessed the situation, all the non verbal communication etc.  \nSo it is possible that OP did interact better than I assume, but it won't really change the outcome. OP saying she was loud, has me believe she could have handled the situation better, lacking a little finesse in communicating but that doesn't make her an asshole, it doesn't make her attention seeking.   \n\n\nSo it is a NTA!", "Soft YTA, It sounds like you made a scene there by making this so much bigger deal than it needed to be.

There was no reason for you to loudly announce that you would not be eating the cake because you just knew you would not like it.

I get the impulse to just explain honestly, but it seems that it\u2019ll just cause more friction in your family because they feel entitled to a justification of your diagnosis. They\u2019re not, but you were diagnosed later in life, so it is an adjustment to how they see you. If you don\u2019t like certain ingredients, maybe next time it\u2019ll go over more smoothly to say that. Everyone has foods they don\u2019t like, so it\u2019ll be something they can relate more to. It also seems your cousin/family might\u2019ve been offended by you announcing this loudly and in front of everyone\u2014maybe tell your cousin/whoever cooks in private next time, because the person who made it is the only one who needs notice. \n\nFood has social importance, especially when it\u2019s homemade, so it makes a sense that your cousin would be hurt if you wouldn\u2019t eat her food based on a reason she doesn\u2019t understand. Her misunderstanding this time is her fault, not yours, but it\u2019ll help everyone if you can initiate a conversation with her about it so that she knows it was never an issue with her or her cooking, she just made something you can\u2019t eat. \n\nBest of luck OP.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Lead and petrochemical water pollution, air pollution and edible synthetics have been on a similar rise. \n\n*I kinda think our parents gave us all autism, man.*\n\nThe number of things that I do that make me suspect myself and the number of things I see other allegedly allistic people do that make me feel the same are really giving NOT A COINCIDENCE lately.", "OP could've said anything from \"I'm not a fan of cake\" to simply \"No, thank you\" and it would have been fine. Instead it's a whole thing \"because autism\". \n\nAnd they didn't say \"I don't want it\", like people are interpreting. They said: \"I know I won't like it\" which can be interpreted as a jab at the cook. If I said to my spouse \"You cooked today. I won't eat it because I know I won't like it\" I'd be in trouble.\n\nOP, nobody is ever going to be able to force you to eat anything you don't want to. You (and everyone else) can always say \"No, thanks\" and be done with it. YTA because you're using autism as an excuse to be impolite.", "She said she wouldn't like any and moved away,  not rude. Why did she need to stand next to a cake she's not getting a piece from?", "Why,  exactly, is it not ok? I don't see a problem with it.", ">\"Around 5pm, a massive cake was brought out for everyone. It was a sponge cake, topped with whipped cream and various fruits. I knew I wasn't going to eat any of the cake bc whipped cream, strawberries and raspberries(which were on the cake) are some of the foods that agitate my sensory issues. I said out loud that I wouldn't like any and began to walk away.\"  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>No one offered her any cake.  \n>  \n>She announced that she wouldn't like any and walked away.   \n>  \n>She was attention seeking and rude.  \n>  \n>If she didn't want any cake, just sit down and be quiet.  \n>  \n>I'm sure no one would have noticed until she made sure she did.  \n>  \n>RUDE.", "Exactly. OP mentioned two symptoms of their autism food texture and not always understanding what is and is not socially acceptable. They were only diagnosed a few months ago. They are still learning how to handle those. Mom and the cousin are assholes for knowing so little about autism that they called it attention seeking.", "And sometimes people are getting tired of ND behavior because like this situation it is attn grabbing.  You had to make your issue known.  You could have handled it quietly but you had to make it all about you", "They probably can mimic the socially acceptable behavior, but the problem is that because they are autistic, they aren\u2019t easily able to identify what it is.", "Not eating something isn\u2019t hiding behind a diagnosis. But OP didn\u2019t need to announce it.", "Sometimes i go nonverbal because a situation stresses me out a lot not because i dont want ro talk to somebody. I think op is having the same issue.", "The whole \"I went non verbal\" just rubs me the wrong way. It's not a state you decide to go in... It looks like she is learning the appropriate terms and using them in the wrong context. I am pretty sure she was sulking.\nAnd YTA because you could have just not told anyone anything and it would have been fine.", "Don\u2019t think she went none verbal just refused to speak, attention!", "Sometimes it excuses rude behaviour. Sometimes autistic folks literally do not understand social niceties, especially ones that involve lying. Asking them to see that can be like asking a blind person to just see.", "17 is more than old enough to understand that she shouldn't announce in front of everyone that she won't like the cake and won't be eating it.  She wasn't even offered a piece yet.", "She's not punishing her for declining, she's punishing her for announcing that she won't like the cake in front of everyone, which was a rude thing to do. No one had even offered her a piece of cake yet, anyways.", "I don't think the issue is declining food. I personally say no to most desserts offered at parties. I think the issue is loudly announcing \"I won't eat this\" before it was even offered, and then walking away from the gathering.", "They didnt simply decline\n\nThey werent even offered cake yet.  OP unprompted went center stage. Got everyone attention. Made it known they know they would not like this cake so wont eat it (with no explanation so most would assume shes insulting the cake/baker) dropped the mic, and walked off", "I have ADHD and I have sensory issues.\n\nI'm not sure why everyone says you're rude because you don't like it. It's your opinion, you don't agree it took her long, you said you don't like it and don't want any. Pushing seems rude to me.", "I'm sorry . . . do you go to these lengths every time you're at a family occasion and you say \"no thanks\" to an offer of dessert because you're full or not in the mood or it's just not of interest to you? What a ridiculous take. She's not required to bow and scrape to someone who is literally being ableist and calling her a liar with regards to her own experience of disability to her face. WTF?", "Possibly, but OP's version is what we have to work with. If she said \"I wouldn't like that\" it does sound rude. Saying \"No, thank you\" and even \"maybe later\" would be polite.", "You have no idea what she said, exactly, or how she said it.\n\nShe could have said something complimentary and declined.\n\nShe was rude and inconsiderate.", "Big difference in how you say it.", "And her cousin has the right to be upset about it. Rights aren't really the issue here. \n\nIt's more about the social norms of a situation. Which, understandably, OP might not have quite got the grasp of.\n\nI have the right to say lots of things, quite often I won't do so. Maybe because it might upset someone else, making both our lives less joyful.", "That's not how autism works.", "This! People with autism have a hard time understanding social cues but it shouldnt be used an an excuse to be rude, OP sounds like a typical teenager, once matured maybe OP will realise this", "Nobody asked if she wanted cake tho", "If everyone is in one room where the cake is, and she walks into a different room just because she doesnt want cake, its silly. I assumed everyone was by the cake therefore she was making a scene by walking away from everyone just because she didnt want cake", "It did draw attention though, so take note OP\u2014if you don\u2019t want people to pay attention in this manner, adjust your behavior accordingly.", "She literally stated that she went \"non-verbal\"!", "I completely agree! I had picked up on that by that age, but I didn\u2019t want to assume social support needs from OP and give that caveat not as an excuse, but as a reminder that we\u2019re all learning, some faster than others. \n\nI was also doing my best to imply that there is room to grow and understand that nobody is expected to accommodate anything, especially if it\u2019s delivered rudely and publicly.", "Umm, it's not \"lengths\". I have certainly said \"wow, that looks amazing! You did a great job! I'm just full/avoiding sweets/allergic to X\" or what now. So, yes, I have both complimented the chef AND declined eating something. It's not hard.", "OP is rude and inconsiderate.", "What lengths?? All you have to do is wait until you\u2019re offered cake and then simply say \u201eNo thanks, I don\u2019t want any cake right now. But it looks so good, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s delicious!\u201c", "I mean, OP is also autistic. I agree that they could have handled it better, but being unintentionally blunt is a feature of autism."]}
