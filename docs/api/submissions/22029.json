I was diagnosed with autism a few months ago, but I've displayed traits of neurodivergency since I was a little kid. One of these traits was a major dislike of certain tastes and textures, as well as not always behaving accordingly in certain social situations.  Not alot of my extended family knows bc I don't see them very often bc they live towards the North East of the country while I live down in the South East.\nSo, now, on with the story.\nI, 17F, was at a family gathering with my extended family a few days ago. It was a big get-together with lots of different food and drinks. Around 5pm, a massive cake was brought out for everyone. It was a sponge cake, topped with whipped cream and various fruits. I knew I wasn't going to eat any of the cake bc whipped cream, strawberries and raspberries(which were on the cake) are some of the foods that agitate my sensory issues. I said out loud that I wouldn't like any and began to walk away. My cousin called after me and said that she worked really hard on it and it would be really disrespectful if I didn't even bother to try it. I tried to explain that I couldn't tolerate certain textures because of my autism, she said I was making up excuses and that I'm \"perfectly normal\" and just \"attention seeking\". I brushed her off and left the room and just chilled in the living room for a while. My mom took my cousin's side and said what I did was selfish and that I was using my \"disorder\" as a get out of jail free card. I went non-verbal until the next morning, and then that afternoon we drove home, where my mom grounded me for 2 days for how I treated my cousin.\nSo reddit, did I deserve my punishment?

Your Mom was 100% correct; autism is not a get-out-of-jail free card to start acting bratty and entitled. You're clearly developing Main Character Syndrome and you need to nip it in the bud now before you start to alienate everyone who cares for you.\n\nWhat I will say though is that, \"No means no\" applies to everything in life, to include food.

Only once did someone insist that I take it with me. I gave it to my nephew, out of the site of the cake giver. I think OP's relatively new diagnosis, is driving her to speak up.

Even better if you can compliment her hard work.  If they ask you why, you can just follow up with \"I'm just not feeling like cake right now, maybe later.\"  Then, later never comes, and you don't have to do the sensory thing, and they can pretend you were going to, and everything is fine.", "YTA. You need to learn strategies to move through the world. Just because you are autistic it doesn't mean that you get a pass on the social norms. It's time to learn ways to react to these situations with style and grace.  Don't say this stuff out loud. Just leave the room. Or - take a small piece and push it around the plate. Before going to parties, think about the situations that might come up and what you might say or do.  At a party, the host has a role and the guest has a role. The host was rude and wrong to press you on eating the cake. You should have told her that the cake looked great and you see how much she worked on the cake but you can't eat it.  \n\nAlso - your mother. You two need to get on the same page.

Say \"no, thank you\" if someone offers you a slice, and sit at the table with everyone while they have a family event.", "NTA, because you didn\u2019t realize that announcing you wouldn\u2019t like the cake was rude and also stupidly called attention to the fact that you weren\u2019t going to eat any, provoking them to make an issue of it. You started the issue. \n\nNext time you see some food you don\u2019t want, keep that to yourself unless or until someone offers you some.

It's OK not to want a piece of cake, that isn't disrespectful. So the part about being loud has me in the dark if OP could have been percieved as the cousin claimed attention seeking, don't saying that was OPs intent. I can understand the cousins disappointment that OP wasn't even trying the cake, but as I said, not wanting a piece of cake isn't disrespectful and doesn't need to be explained, although it can help to understand that's not the bakers fault. The cousin is at fault for throwing the accusations at OP, no questions about that. OPs mother saying that OP is using her disorder as an get out of jail card, seems seems harsh, but I can see that being done. As I said this is hard without having witnessed the situation, all the non verbal communication etc.  \nSo it is possible that OP did interact better than I assume, but it won't really change the outcome. OP saying she was loud, has me believe she could have handled the situation better, lacking a little finesse in communicating but that doesn't make her an asshole, it doesn't make her attention seeking.   \n\n\nSo it is a NTA!", "Soft YTA, It sounds like you made a scene there by making this so much a bigger deal than it needed to be.

There was no reason for you to loudly announce that you would not be eating the cake because you just knew you would not like it.

I get the impulse to just explain honestly, but it seems that it\u2019ll just cause more friction in your family because they feel entitled to a justification of your diagnosis. They\u2019re not, but you were diagnosed later in life, so it is an adjustment to how they see you. If you don\u2019t like certain ingredients, maybe next time it\u2019ll go over more smoothly to say that. Everyone has foods they don\u2019t like, so it\u2019ll be something they can relate more to. It also seems your cousin/family might\u2019ve been offended by you announcing this loudly and in front of everyone\u2014maybe tell your cousin/whoever cooks in private next time, because the person who made it is the only one who needs notice. \n\nFood has social importance, especially when it\u2019s homemade, so it makes a sense that your cousin would be hurt if you wouldn\u2019t eat her food based on a reason she doesn\u2019t understand. Her misunderstanding this time is her fault, not yours, but it\u2019ll help everyone if you can initiate a conversation with her about it so that she knows it was never an issue with her or her cooking, she just made something you can\u2019t eat. \n\nBest of luck OP.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then they expect a fancy dance of either compliments or \"reasonable\" excuses as to why she couldn't eat it. Being full of food, or not wanting to take \"what looks like a delicious cake\" away from others' opportunity to enjoy it are generally considered acceptable. If you're lucky, NTs will also respect if you have a food allergy that prevents you from eating it, but oNLy if you express admiration and regret for their efforts, and your lack of ability to \"join in\"; which is also silly to me, because being disingenuous would acTually be more \"attention seeking\", as it may lead to someone searching for an alternative for you (no cake? Perhaps you'd like some fruit with ice cream, then)\n\nI might get downvoted for this, but in my experience, neurotypical folks expect a whole song and dance. \n\nAllow them to present you with item- food they prepared, a gift, etc. THEN you must compliment the item/the emotional labor they used in selecting the gift, or making the food. (Wow! That cake is so beautiful! /Wow! I've never had a bomber jacket/sundress/blue suede shoes before! You must have gone to a lot of trouble to find this! Where did you get it, if you don't mind my asking?) THEN, you *might* be able to assert s boundary/ communicate a sensory issue- but be prepared for their hurt feelings and protest. (I'm actually full of food already, thank you sO much, but it wouldn't be right for me to take a piece when I know I can't finish it//) then if more protesting -Well, I do also have some sensory challenges that make it difficult for me to eat ___ (whipped cream, berries with seeds, spongey cakes, etc)... OR, Gosh, this is such a lovely jacket/dress/pair of shoes, but placement of tags/ fabric/ style of shoe does not actually suit me--- then be prepared for them to call you an asshole. \n\nLegitimately *by default* if you deviate from the common opinion (WHAT A GOOD CAKE/ WHAT A LOVELY JACKET/DRESS/PAIR OF SHOES), the neurotypical folx will often believe that your deviance from public/ common opinion is in fact a *criticism* of their own opinion, and that you are \"singling them out\" at best, or \"attention-seeking\"/ \"being an inconsiderate asshole\" at worst. \n\nIMO, OP is NTA, and her mother is for punishing her... But once again, from the lense of NT folx, OPs behavior was \"rude\" and reflects \"poor understanding of social cues\", which reflects \"poor upbringing\", which reflects on her mother. \n\nThe entire thing is a GD song and dance, and unfortunately I'm not sure there would have been a proper solution to this issue... Except for once again, being disingenuous- accepting a slice of cake, chopping it to small pieces and pushing it around on the plate but not really eating it... Although if someone *sees* you not eat it, you'll be in danger of being accused of wastefulness... And in the instance of textural issues with clothes, you're legitimately often expected to just *accept the gift*, and also write a thank you card, and do the whole thing, even if you know you'll never wear the item, or if looking at or touching at it physically makes your skin crawl because *it's the thought that counts*, and even if these folx struggle to *think* about the textural or sensory limits of their autistic/neurodiverse associates, pointing out their lack of knowledge or respect for the sensory issues *makes them feel bad* and is therefore *rude*, and in NT world, *rudeness* is a serious offence, and indicates *your* lack of care for *them*. \n\nSo basically- compliment the cake *first*, imagine what they might like to hear about how pretty it is, or how delicious it might look to others. Then, if you're lucky, *privately* (so as not to hurt their feelings) tell them you won't be sharing any cake \"but it's nothing personal, it looks lovely, I'm sure many others will enjoy it\", and hope they don't turn it into an issue... And when it comes to gifts, accept them even if you don't like them and want to chuck them in the bin, compliment the time/thought they might have used to put into selecting of said gift, write a thank you note after to further express gratitude, and then maybe get rid of the item/ dodge the cake. \n\nI'm sure a handful of folx may take offense to my wall of text here, but I'm hopeful it may at least be helpful to other autists, who seem to struggle in comments a bit here, and I want to prevent others arguing/having misunderstandings as much as possible. \n\nGood luck, everyone.
