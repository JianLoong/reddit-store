Confused I asked him what he meant and he said the living room camera was blocked. I noticed that it was moved- my now 3 year old has been up there and moved pictures etc. I told him I didn\u2019t realize he was using that camera to watch us? He said he just wants to see his family since he travels so much but I said I didn\u2019t like it.

When he made the comments about the living room camera today I could see he was moving it so I unplugged it. He was pissed, accusing me of hiding something.

He can call and ask for a bit of facetime with the kids if he wants to. You can even set up a fifteen-minute part of each day for a quick hello to the camera. But watching you all day, yeah, that's creepy. If he doesn't drop it, go over all the rooms with a fine-tooth comb and look for additional recording devices. I hope you won't find any but it might be worrisome. Had he NOT been commenting on it and watching you without your knowledge it would be kinda sweet, but as it is...that's just creepy.", "NTA.

It's no longer used for its intended purpose of keeping an eye on a toddler.", "I feel like I must express concern for your safety. Often this type of behavior escalates.

The fact that he blew up at you rather than asked about it tells you he has control issues. Stand your ground. I would absolutely hate knowing that I could be watched at any moment and I don't have any thing to hide.", "Big NTA.  \n\nThe problem with a camera is it's one way.  He can see you, you can't see him.  And it sounds like he's watching you an awful lot- big brother style.  \n\nThat's not reasonable, you don't have to accept that.  You should not be under surveillance in your own home.  \n\nTell him if he wants to watch you guys, he should get one of those home video chat gadgets and use that- he sees you, you see him, you both know when it's on and when it's off.", "NTA. I find it really weird how he both flew off the handle AND had been making comments about your habits. My mind immediately jumped to \"he wants you to be paranoid about your actions, to know he's always watching and monitoring, and he's doing these things on purpose so you cannot act out without consequences.\" But, I don't know your relationship and that's the worst case scenario so take it with a heavy scoop of salt", "NTA, he doesn't get to watch you through a camera without YOUR consent.

Now he's demanding total transparency on your end without transparency on his end. It's natural for you to have felt upset in this situation, and to want autonomy and privacy!

Look for ways to open discussion about ways that he can stay connected with you and the children, without watching you.", "NTA, your husband has crossed a major line using a baby cam to basically spy on you throughout the day while he is traveling.

You should be able to relax in your home without worrying about every single thing you do being a reason for him to think you're up to no good.", "NTA, but I think you both need couples therapy for this because he's got himself is a mindset where he thinks he can't trust you.

It's not precisely my husband would spy on me, but he would likely watch them when bored, and comment on things and not realise how annoying and invasive that is no matter how innocuous. Sometimes we need space to be our derpy selves without judgement, y'know?

If OP and her husband weren\u2019t having problems this would actually be a good way to bond long distance. They could each plan something crazy and say tune in at x:xx. Of course hubby would need a camera too to join in on the fun.", "Probably the presence of the cameras increases the level of paranoia as well. I know that when we installed a camera, it elevated some concerns that are *not* concerns until we identified them, and worked to move beyond them. With people that do high power business that tend to be blind to the way they feel and tone deaf to their own shit stinking, the presence of the cameras could have spiraled latent insecurities if gone unacknowledged and unexamined.", "Yeah I reckon you could be onto something here .....", "YTA\nHe wasn't exactly hiding it from you - he made comments that clearly showed he was using it.\nNow all of a sudden you're changing things so that he can't see what's going on, that's sus.\n\nIf he was putting it up in the first place he'd be the AH, but you're changing the status quo so he can't see what you're doing.", "NTA. My husband set up cameras inside our home and I turned them into the corners. My daughter also has a camera set up in her living room. Even though she says she wouldn't use it on me, she has done so more than once. It is an invasion of privacy and I really hate it.

His claim of \u201cmissing seeing my family\u201d goes two ways - his children miss him too.

He is absolutely wrong about \u201cwanting to see my family!\u201d He\u2019s a voyeur on an epic level, and he needs to understand that it creeps you out. It\u2019s bad enough that we\u2019re all watched on cctv at our jobs and in every public place imaginable, but there\u2019s nothing we can do about that.
