We have a 3 year old daughter and a 1 year old son. \n\nWe have baby cameras in both kids rooms, but there is a third camera we have in our living room. The living room camera was placed there last year when my husband traveled for work, because I was alone with a 4 month old and 2 year old. I used it to watch the 2 year old for the few minutes when I needed to put the 4 month old to bed. \n\nFast forward to recently. My husband and I have struggled, with him traveling so much and me being solo with the kids. Mind you I work full time in a stressful role. \n\nToday he blew up at me saying it\u2019s fucked up the camera was blocked and that I pulled his access? Confused I asked him what he meant and he said the living room camera was blocked. I noticed that it was moved- my now 3 year old has been up there and moved pictures etc. I told him I didn\u2019t realize he was using that camera to watch us? He said he just wants to see his family since he travels so much but I said I didn\u2019t like it. Now I realize he\u2019s made comments- he would say things like \u201cyou\u2019re texting so much\u201d. We also have a ring doorbell and when I leave he\u2019ll make comments like \u201chave fun wherever you\u2019re going\u201d. \n\nHere\u2019s where I think I\u2019m the AH. When he made the comments about the living room camera today I could see he was moving it so I unplugged it. He was pissed, accusing me of hiding something. It feels like he\u2019s using the cameras to spy. I\u2019ve never once gave him any reason not to trust me. I just don\u2019t want to be on camera all day.", "created_utc": 1674444418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10j2kr6/aita_for_removing_my_husbands_baby_cam_access/", "score": 208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He can call and ask for a bit of facetime with the kids if he wants to. You can even set up a fifteen-minute part of each day for a quick hello to the camera. But watching you all day, yeah, that's creepy. If he doesn't drop it, go over all the rooms with a fine-tooth comb and look for additional recording devices. I hope you won't find any but it might be worrisome. Had he NOT been commenting on it and watching you without your knowledge it would be kinda sweet, but as it is...that's just creepy.", "NTA. It's \"baby cam,\" not \"wife cam.\"\n\nEven if I wasn't doing anything wrong, I would feel so alarmingly uncomfortable knowing that my every action was being monitored. And for him to make comments on what he sees is *so* invasive.", "NTA, big NTA - this is legitimately creepy behavior. If he wants to \u201csee his family,\u201d he can see his kids through the baby cams, or he can FaceTime you. But this is not at all appropriate. Also, he\u2019s been watching you for this long, and now he says you\u2019re \u201chiding something?\u201d He\u2019s just mad he got caught and can\u2019t spy anymore. Leave that camera unplugged", "Holy hell, NTA. \n\nThe lack of trust is shocking.\n\nMiss your family? Then ask you to text pics of the kids or little videos. FaceTime your family in the evening to read a book to the kids. \n\nCall your damn wife, don\u2019t spy on her.", "NTA, he sounds like he has some major trust, boundary issues that he needs to work on", "NTA\n\n\n\nHe didn't even ask about the camera. He launched into an angry fit about them. He's been using the camera to spy on you. Not okay. Don't know if he's paranoid or projecting but it's very concerning.\n\nNo more baby cam unless you still need to use it in their rooms.\n\nThe fact that you're looking back and realizing how much he's been using the baby and ring cams to spy on you ..... He should have just called or FaceTime you.", "NTA. It's super creepy and disrespectful to be unknowingly watched in your own home and judged by a husband who has trust issues. Even worse when he's basically demanding to be able to supervise your day and you're not to unplug his spycam. That's what it is. It's no longer used for its intended purpose of keeping an eye on a toddler.", "I feel like I must express concern for your safety. Often this type of behavior escalates. I encourage you to talk with your close friends and family members about this. Might also be a good idea to be keenly aware of any other red flags that pop up for your safety and for the kids.\n\nETA :-   NTA", "Heaven forbid you need to scratch your a*s. NTA", "NTA.  There's something wrong here.  Obviously there's a serious lack of trust and maybe even paranoia.  Is there a possibility that he has someone else on those business trips?  Or that he's displaying other symptoms of a mental health issue?  Or maybe he's becoming abusive?", "NTA - yikes. I find the fact that he's been monitoring you and is so angry very creepy.", "NTA. The fact that he blew up at you rather than asked about it tells you he has control issues. Stand your ground. I would absolutely hate knowing that I could be watched at any moment and I don't have any thing to hide.", "Big NTA.  \n\nThe problem with a camera is it's one way.  He can see you, you can't see him.  And it sounds like he's watching you an awful lot- big brother style.  \n\nThat's not reasonable, you don't have to accept that.  You should not be under surveillance in your own home.  \n\nTell him if he wants to watch you guys, he should get one of those home video chat gadgets and use that- he sees you, you see him, you both know when it's on and when it's off.", "NTA. I find it really weird how he both flew off the handle AND had been making comments about your habits. My mind immediately jumped to \"he wants you to be paranoid about your actions, to know he's always watching and monitoring, and he's doing these things on purpose so you cannot act out without consequences.\" But, I don't know your relationship and that's the worst case scenario so take it with a heavy scoop of salt", "NTA, he doesn't get to watch you through a camera without YOUR consent. And no, he also does not get to camera-stalk his child unless YOU consent. Set up these boundaries immediately.", "NTA. I can kind of understand him wanting to see his family if he's travelling and misses everyone. But if I were him, I definitely would have mentioned it right away or asked and stopped if it made my partner uncomfortable.", "NTA - He needs to figure out if the job where he travels this much is worth the kinda paranoid actions he is taking.", "NTA.", "If he hadn't been angry or making those awful comments it would be so different. Those are big red flags. Nta.", "NTA. Watching you without your knowledge or consent is inappropriate and creepy, even for a spouse.\n\nHis overreaction also says he's not coping with his travel situation well.   That's on him, not you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Just because your married doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t get bodily autonomy", "Eewww.\n\nThat is totally 100% creepy behavior.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You deserved transparency and didn't have it. Now he's demanding total transparency on your end without transparency on his end. It's natural for you to have felt upset in this situation, and to want autonomy and privacy! You deserve for your husband to ask, not demand ways to stay connected. Look for ways to open discussion about ways that he can stay connected with you and the children, without watching you.", "NTA, your husband has crossed a major line using a baby cam to basically spy on you throughout the day while he is traveling. That does not say I miss my family, it sends up major red flags for paranoid controlling behavior. It might be better for everyone if he were to travel less and work on his issues with a therapist before he drives an insurmountable wedge between the two of you.", "NTA\n\nI have cameras in several places in my house and they're very useful but it's creepy to use them to watch people that don't know they're being watched. You should be able to relax in your home without worrying about every single thing you do being a reason for him to think you're up to no good.", "NTA, but I think you both need couples therapy for this because he's got himself is a mindset where he thinks he can't trust you. That can absolutely ruin a relationship if its not addressed.", "NTA.", "We send pics throughout the day (when I can) and definitely FaceTime 1-3 times. \n\nI\u2019m just blown away that he thinks he should have unlimited access to me & the kids, like that doesn\u2019t feel okay. I seriously have nothing to hide, but the thought of being watched all day creeps me out.", "I was thinking this.  His snide comments and the spying say he\u2019s accusing her of cheating.  Which is a big sign that he might be projecting and is the one cheating.  She\u2019s home with a 2 year old and a 4 month old\u2026.what can she have time to do?", "Especially since you don't have the same option to watch him continually throughout the day. Plus he shouldn't be judging you while you spend all your time taking care of a house, kids and everything that is involved with that while he focuses on work. While he's away, he gets uninterrupted sleep, hot meals and showers that last longer than 5 minutes.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nBut your hubs is cheating and is projecting his bullshit on you.", "so creepy and huge red flag.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou are not nearly creeped out enough about this.......", "NTA Sounds like you need to have a conversation.
