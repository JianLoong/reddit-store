The living room camera was placed there last year when my husband traveled for work, because I was alone with a 4 month old and 2 year old. I used it to watch the 2 year old for the few minutes when I needed to put the 4 month old to bed. \n\nFast forward to recently.

Mind you I work full time in a stressful role. \n\nToday he blew up at me saying it\u2019s fucked up the camera was blocked and that I pulled his access? Confused I asked him what he meant and he said the living room camera was blocked. I noticed that it was moved- my now 3 year old has been up there and moved pictures etc. I told him I didn\u2019t realize he was using that camera to watch us? He said he just wants to see his family since he travels so much but I said I didn\u2019t like it. Now I realize he\u2019s made comments- he would say things like \u201cyou\u2019re texting so much\u201d.

When he made the comments about the living room camera today I could see he was moving it so I unplugged it. He was pissed, accusing me of hiding something.

He can call and ask for a bit of facetime with the kids if he wants to. You can even set up a fifteen-minute part of each day for a quick hello to the camera. But watching you all day, yeah, that's creepy. If he doesn't drop it, go over all the rooms with a fine-tooth comb and look for additional recording devices. I hope you won't find any but it might be worrisome. Had he NOT been commenting on it and watching you without your knowledge it would be kinda sweet, but as it is...that's just creepy.", "NTA. It's \"baby cam,\" not \"wife cam.\"\n\nEven if I wasn't doing anything wrong, I would feel so alarmingly uncomfortable knowing that my every action was being monitored.

Also, he\u2019s been watching you for this long, and now he says you\u2019re \u201chiding something?\u201d He\u2019s just mad he got caught and can\u2019t spy anymore.

He should have just called or FaceTime you.", "NTA. It's super creepy and disrespectful to be unknowingly watched in your own home and judged by a husband who has trust issues.

It's no longer used for its intended purpose of keeping an eye on a toddler.", "I feel like I must express concern for your safety. Often this type of behavior escalates.

He can see you, you can't see him.  And it sounds like he's watching you an awful lot- big brother style.  \n\nThat's not reasonable, you don't have to accept that.  You should not be under surveillance in your own home.  \n\nTell him if he wants to watch you guys, he should get one of those home video chat gadgets and use that- he sees you, you see him, you both know when it's on and when it's off.", "NTA. I find it really weird how he both flew off the handle AND had been making comments about your habits. My mind immediately jumped to \"he wants you to be paranoid about your actions, to know he's always watching and monitoring, and he's doing these things on purpose so you cannot act out without consequences.\" But, I don't know your relationship and that's the worst case scenario so take it with a heavy scoop of salt", "NTA, he doesn't get to watch you through a camera without YOUR consent.

Sometimes we need space to be our derpy selves without judgement, y'know?

Of course hubby would need a camera too to join in on the fun.", "Probably the presence of the cameras increases the level of paranoia as well. I know that when we installed a camera, it elevated some concerns that are *not* concerns until we identified them, and worked to move beyond them.

My husband set up cameras inside our home and I turned them into the corners. My daughter also has a camera set up in her living room.

I got to pull recording of the first time my toddler rolled over as a baby, the first time she said \u201cmama.\u201d  \n\nSometimes we need to refer to the footage - to see how the dog ended up behind the sofa (toddler pushed him off the back, he\u2019s ok and she\u2019s gotten a talking-to).  \n\nOnce I peeked in on a childcare provider and he was carrying my toddler and she was missing a sock, I called to jokingly ask where her sock was, and he said it was in his pocket and she was very upset - didn\u2019t want him to sit down, wanted to be held a certain way (and that certain way kept changing)\u2026after 4 hours of screaming she had 2 new teeth. I cut out of work early because he was having a rough time. I wouldn\u2019t have called if I hadn\u2019t seen a reason to. He hadn\u2019t called me.   \n\nIt\u2019s like the difference between texting and calling - I have the 2 seconds to peek in on the camera, I don\u2019t have the 10 minutes while I\u2019m working to make a personal phone call.  \n\nI also use the cameras if I\u2019ve put something down and I can\u2019t remember where. Once my mom thought she came in with a bag and she didn\u2019t have it when she left - we couldn\u2019t find it, referred to the cameras\u2026cameras didn\u2019t show her with any bag.\n\nI use the cameras if my husband doesn\u2019t text back and I want to see if he\u2019s home from work, etc. We\u2019re family, nobody cares who is farting while on camera.  Nobody is leering at the camera for hours. \n\nNobody finds my using our very clearly visible household cameras \u201ccreepy.\u201d  My dad had me install some at his house; he doesn\u2019t even have a smart phone and can\u2019t access them, but I get the notifications if there\u2019s unexpected motion at night. I sometimes use them to see if he\u2019s at his house when he\u2019s not responding to his phone.  I can talk to him through the camera. \n\nYour husband has access to the cameras, which you know about, and he misses his family.  He\u2019s letting you know when he\u2019s watching the camera. He\u2019s not spying on you. \nYou\u2019re allowed to feel uncomfortable about the unexpected realization that he\u2019s using the cameras, and you\u2019re allowed to set boundaries with him regarding their use. My cameras have a scheduling option, I can set when authorized users I\u2019ve added do/do not have access. \n\nKnowing that he has access, can\u2019t *he* watch your 2 year old while you\u2019re putting the baby to bed?  Or watch the kids while you use the restroom?  The camera allows him to contribute to parenting remotely, in a way that FaceTime and photos absolutely do not. \n\nI don\u2019t understand all of these \u201che\u2019s abusive\u201d \u201che\u2019s a creep\u201d responses. I only saw one YTA, which I also disagreed with. Mentally preparing myself for the downvotes\u2026", "You guys need to talk stat!!!! \nHe is insecure - you are going crazy - you need to get to the root of the situation. I traveled a lot and FaceTime was awesome but you also miss out on alot of stuff.", "NTA\n\nThat's creepy, ngl. I'd be mad and freaked out. It's unsettling behaviour, especially his commentary.", "Definitely NTA. What he's doing is a violation of your privacy - you're not a prisoner & nobody needs access to see what you're doing any time they want. That's creepy & it's not what baby cams are for. If he wants to know what you're up to during the day, he should call or text you.", "NTA this is creepy and unfair.  If he wants to see his family, he should just facetime more.  Spying on you is unacceptable.\n\nThe other option is he looks for a job that doesn't require so much travel.", "NTA, you deserve your privacy and it's an unhealthy dynamic. I agree with others saying that it's projecting and it seems like he's doing the \"boss's justification\" where you justify an action with seemingly positive intent, but the actual motivation behind those actions are usually far more malicious.\n\nIf you come away from this thread with an increasing sense of suspicion and you can't leave the relationship in a reasonable timeline, I would compromise by demanding the ability to engage in counter-surveillance on your husband such as Find My iPhone or an Android equalivent among other things using those same justifications. Something tells me that your husband will back down or put up some walls which you can build on to further communicate.", "NTA Your husband was spying on you.", "Yta", "This is her husband who she has 2 kids with. He has seen her naked and he has put his dick in her. How is watching her fully clothed in the living room invasive?", "You know what would be better than a 15 minute  hello to the camera? A 15 minute FaceTime call. \n\nThe camera is creepy.", "He\u2019s her husband, not her OWNER/MASTER.", "It's still unsettling, especially his commentary when she's texting or goes out, and that she was completely unaware of it until now. I'd be concerned about my safety around him in this kind of situation. He got pissed off that the camera was blocked. Why is he pissed off instead of simply inquisitive? I'd be running so fast.", "Oh my god you're disgusting", "because she consented to that, she didn't consent to being filmed every day of her life so her husband can spy and make passive aggressive remarks every time she leaves the house", "Marrying someone or having sex with them does not mean they have an inherent right to monitor -you-. Not your time online, not track your car to see where you go, not your bank statements if you have separate accounts. Marriage does not mean your spouse gets to act like you live in a surveillance state - particularly when he did not communicate he was doing it until now and then got huffy when she was uncomfortable with it. And why is this surveillance only one way if it's so fair? Does she have access to watch him all day when he's on his trips, which are much more likely to be when a spouse does something sketchy? And then he thinks he has a right to make comments on what she does when she didn't even know he was monitoring her.\n\nI don't see how this WOULDN'T be invasive when both partners haven't willingly agreed to it. Any circumstances that would make it 'okay' would require her knowing and agreeing. He's not HER parent, he's her partner.", "Questioning where she's going and about how much she's texting sounds like this relationship is going to go down a dark path.", "[removed]", "We have a security camera in our kitchen to see both doors, and when my husband is away working I\u2019ll still cover it with a cup. He does the same for me when he\u2019s home and I\u2019m not. \n\nIt\u2019s used for security, like when I\u2019m asleep and he needs to come home at 4am so I can\u2019t bar the door. Not for him to watch me do the dishes or sing loudly off key while I make myself dinner. He\u2019s welcome to see those things, but we both have no interest in making the other feel like they\u2019re \u201con\u201d at all times.  \n\nCould your husband be coming from a place of feeling guilty he isn\u2019t home enough? His comments aren\u2019t nice at all, but he also sounds angry at everything and the entire situation. Or he\u2019s simply an AH. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yup, any dude that wants cameras inside the house is going to be a problem", "Of course not \"owner\" or \"master\". I did NOT say he was either of those things. .", "You should see their comment on \"well-adjusted adults\". They've been abused to be blindly obedient and they definitely are going to abuse if they haven't already.", "Sounds like it already is in one.\n\nThis some Joe Golberg shit.", "My husband left town once and hid a camera in our bedroom to \"make sure I was safe\" and acted shocked when I found it and told him I didn't like that.", "Yeah it's just how it's set up. I'd be MORE creeped out when I found out he'd been spying for a bit and never said anything, at least this guy didn't try to hide his creeping, even though its still unsettling. It's entirely possible he doesn't see it as being creeping and just hasn't thought it through very well or just assumed it was a given he'd be looking, but that doesn't make it better or ok. If my spouse told me that he liked being able to peak on on the chaos at home if he was away for long periods of time I'd be far less creeped out than finding out he's been doing without saying anything, and monitoring how much I do certain things. That's a new level of obsessed.", "Exactly my experience!", "NTA. Its a baby-cam for safety not a stalk-ya-wife cam.", "don't allow yourself to be spied on.", "NTA - That's creepy and insecure, not loving. Find other ways to connect across distance and have an honest conversation about what's making him feel the way he is so that you can hopefully solve the root problem. The spying is the symptom. Something deeper is the cause.", "NTA\n\nI can see wanting to see the family, face time that is one thing.  But the entire using the baby cam and ring cam to make those kinds of comments, are really creepy and wrong.  Especially if he is using it to spy and tell you things through the ring cameras.\n\nThis seems a bit far darker connotation to it, seems a bit controlling and invasion of privacy kind of feeling.  \n\nMarriage counseling is a must, and check your cell phone as well, maybe doing a factory resetting on it.", "NTA\n\nHis using the cameras to second guess your parenting is too controlling. If he really wants to only be able to see his family, then he could be allowed to. You should also not have to put up with surveillance to second guess your parenting. Here's the deal: you will leave on the cameras for as long as he only uses it to watch the kids or to talk to you about something vital. Any nitpicking will result in the cameras being shut off until he gets home to talk civilly about any concerns.", "NTA. We have a dog cam with two way audio. Once, I was home alone with the dog and my husband used the microphone to say something nice like \u201chello my beautiful ladies!\u201d I freaked out, he apologized for scaring me, and now it\u2019s standard practice for us to keep the camera unplugged and only plug it back in when we leave the dog home alone.", "NTA. Why not just set up a video chat every day or every few days if he's that worried?", "NTA, and his watching PLUS his comments are very abusive. He needs to get a job where he\u2019s home more AND y\u2019all need couple\u2019s counseling asap.", "Nta at all. He's unstable. Consider your options please", "Your leaving the house means he can\u2019t follow you on camera.  Your texting bothers him because he doesn\u2019t know who you are connecting with.  Yet he is away from home for work a lot and you are supposed to just trust him.", "NTA, this is super creepy red flag behavior", "Exactly. It\u2019s creepy especially because of the comments he made. I\u2019m glad i got cameras that don\u2019t connect over wifi. \nOP NTA.", "yeah, its not even like the comments are like \u201ci miss you!\u201d they\u2019re all passive aggressive", "This. OP, his behavior is creepy. I would never put that camera up and not give him access to any of the other cameras in the house. Our baby cameras just have a monitor, maybe go and purchase those instead so they can't even be viewed on a phone. And I would put tape over the Ring camera or have it removed. All of this is disturbing.", "still doesn\u2019t give him the right to be spying on her all the time", "Yeah, and he\u2019s the one who\u2019s traveling free of kids. Out of the father who travels all the time and the mother who works while taking care of 2 kids, I know who Id bet on for being more likely to cheat. Especially since it sounds like he might be projecting.", "I interpreted that as - if  she knew he was regularly using that camera and had her consent. That would have been ok / possibly sweet intentioned. But it\u2019s the deception and obvious discomfort that\u2019s bang out of line."]}
