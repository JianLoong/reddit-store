Jen accused my husband (just friends at the time) of attacking her, because she turned him down. Jen was my BFF, but t he couldn't have attacked here as we and a group of friends were taking pictures at completely different part of the convention center. Jen blew up a lot of social media, and because we didn't realize what was going on until hours later, a lot of damage was done. Including Hubby losing his job when we got home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI stopped talking to Jen immediately, and with the few people that believed us, managed to pull together a court case and sue Jen . We won the case but a lot of damage was done, and Hubby had to move to a different city to find work as no one would hire him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout five years go by,  Hubby moves gets into therapy hardcore, gets a decent paying job again,etc. However Hubby gets a message from Jen saying she wants to apologize the night before our wedding night. He doesn't reply, but it did kind of shake him up. But we go about our lives. I have never been quiet about why I decided to stop talking to Jen. but left Hubby his story to tell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe finally purchased a house back in Oct of this year, due to life, our first big friend party was scheduled for the holidays combined it with a \"We got a house\" type thing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe had quite a few people, rotating out to go to other parties/events and \"doorman\" working so that no strange people were just showing up. However at one point my husband who is calm under pressure rushes from the living room upstairs. I excuse myself to make certain he wasn't sick, only to find him in our bedroom, having a panic attack. I only managed to get out that \"She was here\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaking sure that Hubby was fine, I head downstairs beeline to our doorman and ask who came in with Jen, he points them out. I rush over tell them to get Jen our of my effing house by the time I count to ten or I'm tossing her out myself. They start to fight me and then Jen comes over, I just kept repeating that she needs to get the hell out of my house, and she keeps demanding to know why, as we \"were kids back then\". I tell her Kids don't ruin someone's life by saying they assaulted her, all why basically walking her out my house, and told her I would call the cops if she ever shows her face around us again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe party starts again, but you can tell the vibe is off, and people start leaving. I'm so angry that I don't realize until one of my friends hugs me goodbye. However a few days later, I get a DM from Jen's friends says that someone else at the party works with Jen and told everyone at work that Jen was a lair and falsely accused my husband and got fired right before the holidays. I just reply \"Karma\" and blocked them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut now that I think about it I worried maybe I could have been more level headed, while I don't feel bad about kicking her out, maybe I could have kept calmer and not display everything. nor been so AH-ish with my reply.", "created_utc": 1671761199, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zt3p4m/aita_for_ruining_the_holidays/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need a restrain I order & to start filming every time she barges into your life! \n\nEdit: Those people who helped her should be cut out of your life!", "NTA accusing a man or a male teenager falsely of sexual assault needs an innate nasty streak imho and the audacity to think she can simply walk into your house and demand forgiveness. She had it coming. The possibility that she got fired because of her false accusations would have been significantly lower when she hadn\u2019t crashed your party. Some might say it\u2019s kind of poetic justice. Your husband lost his job and more because of her and now she lost her job.", "NTA. Your reaction was warranted.

I have never slandered her and when people asked why we no longer talked, I always say \"I don't like people that lie about someone to make themselves better and they can ask her (Jen) how her court case went.\"  \nWe don't forgive nor forget here for something like this.", "I honestly can not give a direct reason, my only thought is that when Jen messaged Hubby on our Wedding night she was either going to apologize (my wishful thinking) or she was going to try something different (crash the wedding or something). Part of me wants to think that Jen showed up at the party not knowing it was our house (she's been blocked on everything forever) or perhaps maybe she was trying to start drama. I don't have a full story as everyone who is on team Jen is blocked/removed from our lives.

However from the little info I got from the co-working friend, Jen basically stayed in a High school mindset and I guess made work toxic prior and when it came out that she accused someone of a crime like that people at work pretty much refused to work with her as they didn't want to be left alone with her or having anything to do with her.", "Good for you!

You definitely had every right to kick her out.\nJealousy is a hell of a drug.", "That's understandable. It can be really hard to speak on difficult things in court. So your husband being burned out at the time is not surprising.\n\nIf whoever brought Jen knows the history you should cut them out of your lives. If I were Jen the last place I'd want to be is anywhere near the person I falsely accused. So I doubt she has good intentions.", "That makes more sense then.", "Jen wouldn't be fired just because of what you said at your home. So don't feel bad about that. It was Karma so your reply was accurate. NTA.", "Hopefully, this will follow her at every single interview. When they call for a reference they will mention it. Extended Karma.", "We have camera's everywhere and we both WFH so it's pretty impossible to get anywhere near us. We also live rather close to a gated community so there's security that roams around. But thank you for you worry! We'll press charges without a doubt if she tries anything.", "Good. I hope you and your husband have a great life together."]}
