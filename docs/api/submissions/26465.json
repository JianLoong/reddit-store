He claims he can\u2019t fall asleep without the TV on, but I can\u2019t fall asleep unless I\u2019m in a dark room. Sleeping with the tv on is bad for your sleep quality and health, it\u2019s a bad habit that irks me and it prevents me from falling asleep. He thinks I should just patiently wait to go to sleep until he falls asleep so that he can fall asleep with the TV on. I think this is a ridiculous ask and really selfish. I think he needs to break this bad habit and not expect me not to go to sleep over it. He claims because I didn\u2019t let him fall asleep with the TV on last night, he couldn\u2019t get good sleep at all, and missed his workout in the morning because his sleep was so terrible. He says he gets a lot less sleep than me and that he needs to get up a lot earlier than me and commute long hours when I don\u2019t, so his sleep should be prioritized. I work from home and get up much later. Am I the asshole for not letting him fall asleep with the TV on?\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve suggested many times sleeping in separate rooms due to his snoring and he is adamantly against it.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for all your replies, very insightful. He has agreed to wear sleep headphones. Thanks to the person who suggested it\u2014I hadn\u2019t seen those before.

But for disregarding and minimizing his issue, defining it as a selfish request, and expecting him to just get over it without trying to find a compromise (at least from how it appears). If he\u2019s selfish wanting you to deal with him sleeping with the tv on because he needs it. It\u2019s hypocritical of you to expect him to go without because it bothers you. Now your reasoning for why sleeping with a TV on not healthy for a good sleep, it\u2019s understandable. Blue light and dialog are not conducive to a good nights sleep. However, some people like, and need, noise and/or light to help them sleep and get better sleep. I am one of them. I have to have a fan when I sleep but it\u2019s not just about having the cool air flow, I have to have the noise. I also can\u2019t have light but I have to have some white noise to block out the silence and noise from outside. \n\nYou could (and should) ask what about the TV being on does he need? If it\u2019s both the noise and light, you could get a nightlight and white noise machine. If it\u2019s just one, you can get the aforementioned item for that specific reason. If you are still not ok with the white noise machine or a night then honestly you should sleep in separate rooms so you both get quality sleep. However if you are determined to still sleep in the same room then you need to find a compromise. You can do as he suggested and wait up to turn the tv off, he can go to bed earlier (if his schedule allows) and you turn the tv off when you come to bed, or you get white noise machine, fan, nightlight etc\u2026\n\nHe is not wrong that ensuring he gets proper sleep takes priority (especially if you\u2019re sharing sleeping quarters). By your own admission you are able to get more sleep than he is. While lack of quality sleep can effect both of your job performances, mental health etc\u2026 he has to commute to and from work and driving tired is dangerous and potentially life threatening.
