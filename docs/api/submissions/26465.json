But for disregarding and minimizing his issue, defining it as a selfish request, and expecting him to just get over it without trying to find a compromise (at least from how it appears). If he\u2019s selfish wanting you to deal with him sleeping with the tv on because he needs it. It\u2019s hypocritical of you to expect him to go without because it bothers you. Now your reasoning for why sleeping with a TV on not healthy for a good sleep, it\u2019s understandable. Blue light and dialog are not conducive to a good nights sleep. However, some people like, and need, noise and/or light to help them sleep and get better sleep. I am one of them. I have to have a fan when I sleep but it\u2019s not just about having the cool air flow, I have to have the noise. I also can\u2019t have light but I have to have some white noise to block out the silence and noise from outside. \n\nYou could (and should) ask what about the TV being on does he need? If it\u2019s both the noise and light, you could get a nightlight and white noise machine. If it\u2019s just one, you can get the aforementioned item for that specific reason. If you are still not ok with the white noise machine or a night then honestly you should sleep in separate rooms so you both get quality sleep. However if you are determined to still sleep in the same room then you need to find a compromise. You can do as he suggested and wait up to turn the tv off, he can go to bed earlier (if his schedule allows) and you turn the tv off when you come to bed, or you get white noise machine, fan, nightlight etc\u2026\n\nHe is not wrong that ensuring he gets proper sleep takes priority (especially if you\u2019re sharing sleeping quarters). By your own admission you are able to get more sleep than he is. While lack of quality sleep can effect both of your job performances, mental health etc\u2026 he has to commute to and from work and driving tired is dangerous and potentially life threatening.

When we talked about it, it turned out she mostly liked it because it drowned out noises from outside that would wake her up more than the sounds from the TV did. So I bought a white noise machine which solved both problems - covered the outside noises for her, easier to tune out than TV sounds for me.", "Sounds like their bed times cross.", "He doesn\u2019t live 200 years ago. It\u2019s easy to fall asleep and wake up without caffeine and sugar, tv/phones, weird schedules and alarm clocks, blackout curtains and all the rest. Our circadian rhythms are fucked up; for many, beyond repair even with effort.\n\nYou can stamp your foot and say it\u2019s not valid but really\u2026 it is what it is. Thankfully, it\u2019s a problem with many viable solutions!", "What a ridiculous statement. Some people need background noise and are used to falling asleep to the TV on ( my husband because he lived in the projects as a child and it comforted him rather than hearing ppl yelling, gun shots, sirens and everything else..) we DON'T live in the culture that's 200 years ago... ppl are *valid* sleeping however the fuck they want", "I tried that. But whenever the TV turned off I wake up.  But since I'm single it's no problem. I sleep with it on.", "1000s of years ago it wasn\u2019t silent darkness. There is tons of ambient noise outdoors, and there would be flickering from campfires, and/or light from the moon and stars.  Silent darkness could arguably be the weirder request when looking at evolution.", "This is a ridiculous argument. They\u2019re two people with two different sleeping habits. When you\u2019re married, you work with your spouse to find solutions to issues of personal preference like this. Digging in and trying to justify why you\u2019re actually the one in the right is a selfish and unhelpful attitude. \n\nAll that aside, you acting like this is some matter of genetic destiny is hilarious lol. Like someone afraid of flying going \u201cHumans didn\u2019t evolve to fly, so we are staying on the ground!\u201d", "What does evolution have to do with it?", "Why should OP have to stay awake until her partner falls asleep? That's such a ridiculous thing to expect.", "Or husband can go to bed earlier. She goes to bed at 11, he can go to bed at 10 so he's asleep by the time she wants to turn in", "That's what I do. I wear headphones to sleep when I wake in the night and can't fall back asleep.", "Sleep mask boom problem solved", "They also make headband earphones specifically for sleep. Then you don\u2019t have anything poking you when you\u2019re trying to fall asleep.", "Pillow speaker for him might also work.", "That has absolutely nothing to do with gender. If she was the one who wanted to watch TV at night (or listen to music or whatnot) and disrupt his sleep, I\u2019d say the same thing. They need to figure out sleeping arrangements separately, but I agree that they one with a more disruptive sleep routine should be the one to make the concessions while they\u2019re working it out.", "This is what I do! I used to put on movies and found despite what every damn pundit says I sleep so much better with the TV. But now my anxiety is worse and i can't wake up to silence or I think every pop and creak is someone coming to murder me. So audiobooks play all night.", "Audio books for me.too.\n\nAns not just to fall asleep. I have one on all damn day", "My husband likes to keep the TV on longer than I do for sports, and this is what I do. I got some sleep earbuds, listen to an audiobook with white noise app running in the background, and a sleep mask.", "I used to do that too! It worked so well it would take me weeks to get through a podcast\u2026 three minutes or so at a time.", "I second the white noise machine. We now listen to thunderstorms, and he has his noise, I have my restful sleep. Plus, we both like the fan, so that helps.", "I turned it down to like 4, it was the light that would bug him.. but because I have a couple issues with silence that's the only thing that let me sleep for a while. It would turn off my brain, but the opposite for him. It's a lot better now but it was a huge strain. It was also the light that helped me sleep. Otherwise absolutely. I tired the noise machine stuff but it would ramp my anxiety up more because I couldn't see things I guess. I think it depends on the situation. I'd absolutely be all for it but it didn't work for my case.", "Right, like my wife likes the fan on, so the compromise is, we sleep with the fan on. LoL", "The idea that sleeping with the TV on is more disruptive is a personal bias. It\u2019s not any more disruptive than OPs husband being disrupted by the silence that OP wants.", "Me too.  \ud83d\ude06 \ud83e\udd23 \ud83d\ude02", "White noise. I tried a couple from Amazon and found one that I really like. I also will put the tv on sleep timer, volume very low, and wear an eye mask. Again, tried a couple from Amazon and found one I like.", "Have you managed to be able to listen to them faster than 1x speed?\n\nI'm up to 2x for most books.", "My husband has a free app on his phone with many different sounds"]}
