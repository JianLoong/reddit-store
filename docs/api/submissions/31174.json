Based on a \"feeling\" lol", "I also do it to be present with the people who are...present. Don't need notifications or lights interrupting my already poorly tied together train of thought.", "Interesting stance. \n\nSome folk would agree with your statement and others will feel that calling it \" Baggage\" is a negative cop-out to avoid having empathy for others and results in that person feeling like their partner is completely dismissing  their feelings and experiences.  \n\nIf his partner has some niggling issue, which she does, then my response was akin to a healthy response for him to try in order to support her and help relieve doubt. Personally, she's super anxious and insecure.. why.. We don't know. If he gives her reason to be based on things he did previously, then she is in her rights. If he didn't, she's got stuff to work on. Either way, his response isn't helping.  Whether he agrees with me, calls it baggage or tries to have empathy for her is none of my business. I simply offer what I know to be true in my own past based on an old experience I had when I WAS insecure and had been treated poorly by partners. I have my phone face down a lot and it means nothing. That is not true for everyone though.\n\n If my partner had called my experience : baggage: they would not be my partner any longer- I don't think he's the A, but, maybe figuring out why she feels that way is important", "Some folks would agree that if you\u2019re this bothered by the way someone places their phone then *you* need to seek help to resolve that issue. It\u2019s still a you problem.  No one else\u2019s. And stating that does not mean a person has no empathy. \n\nIt is possible to have empathy for a person and still point out that they have lingering issues that they need to resolve because they are allowing that to affect other parts of their lives/other relationships negatively. Saying \u201chey, so you know, this thing happened and a specific action makes me uncomfortable but I am working on it and will work to not allow it affect out relationship\u201d is one thing. It\u2019s another thing to just expect to be able to react to benign actions and say \u201cwell it triggers me and you have no empathy if you don\u2019t accept my behavior around this.\u201d It is a negative cop out to use that as an excuse rather than trying to work in the issue.\n\n\nEdit: look up anxiety cycles and reassurance seeking. Constantly seeking reassurance is only going to give a person short term relief. To find actual freedom from the anxiety you need to actually address the cause. \n\nI\u2019ve been through some shit in my life and gotten caught in that cycle.  No amount of reassurance in the world would make my anxiety about certain things go away until I addressed them. I still have PTSD and the fun things that go with it but I\u2019ve learned that when a thing keeps rearing it\u2019s head and causing me anxiety then I need to really sit with it and figure out why and how to resolve it. \n\nSo, for example, I had to learn that just because my spouse wasn\u2019t talking much didn\u2019t mean they were angry or about to blow up. Me constantly needing reassurance that they were ok was 1. Annoying and 2. A short term bandaid for a me problem. Therapy helped me learn to let go of some of the residual habits from past trauma so I am not constantly seeking reassurance that my   S/O is ok. If they aren\u2019t ok they can communicate that otherwise I am not going to assume the quiet = angry.", "Yes- it's clear his partner needs therapy for whatever she is experiencing as it seems like she is dealing with a lot. I just think it would be helpful of his response was more empathetic and encouraging instead of just saying she was being annoying. \nIt doesn't make him an A or a person incapable of empathy on the whole but she won't see the root of her issue nor seek therapy if she feels like he is dissmissing her concern either.\nSo she realized something was bugging her, she spoke up. That takes more courage for some folk than we give credit for.\n\nI was offering my experience being that I used to be like that.  I had an amazing partner who talked me through it and I learned to trust them. That was was it.  It is hard work for some though and I can say that if my partner had a different response, it would be difficult to feel like I was supported in that journey into therapy.\nSome call that \" Baggage\" But it's just a bad experience that needs some tlc to correct on my opinion and everyone has ugly things they bring into relationships. \n\nPotato Potatto"]}
