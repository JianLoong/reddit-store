He's never been a fan of Vday because it's \"a performative bullshit holiday\" but we tend to either have a nice dinner at home, go eat, or exchange small gifts. It's not a huge priority for me either. This Vday he text me at 1pm to say he was sorry he forgot today was Vday, I said it was fine we have both been busy. A few hours later, I ask him what he'd like to eat or would he rather go get dinner, assuming we would spend the evening together. He informs me he already has plans with his mom, who is in town, and that I could go if I want. I declined. An hour later he let's me know his mom cancelled their dinner and if I'd want to get dinner still. \n\nThat's when I lost it. I cursed him out for essentially making me feel like 2nd choice and forgetting about me that day. Not once during the day did he even say I love you. He told me I was overreacting. That he forgot but I was being really hateful and he takes me out all the time the rest of the yr why is today a big deal. It's just a \"stupid f**king holiday\". \n\nWe didn't speak all week until today when he tried to apologize again but followed it with almost the exact same argument from before, dismissing my feelings and then blaming me for getting angry at him. He believes I just wanted an excuse to rip into him. I have no more energy to try to make him see why I'm so hurt by his actions and honestly don't know if I'll ever get over how hurt I am by his response to this whole thing.

I get rejecting the crass commercialism of Hallmark Holidays, but the whole fucking planet observes romantic love on February 14, and he decides mom is more important than the wife, who will make a fine Plan B.\n\nYou NTA, but if hubby isn't, he's auditioning for the role", "So Vday is not a priority to you, but he should spend it with you all the same? I'm thinking a lot of mixed messages here. His mom is in town (so that means she is not always around?) so they make plans that they invite you to. You were the one to decline. When his mom cancels (for what reason?) you go off at him for thinking you are nr 2? That is not really fair. You were invited, you think Vday is not a priority, he things Vday is BS and then the stars align and it turns out you CAN have dinner together. Why is that bad? I don't get it either. So I'd say YTA here.", "You say that don't prioritize valentines day but it just doesn't seem like it by your reaction. Mixed messages here.", "ESH. Him for dismissing your feelings, you for giving such relevance to a holiday that you don't consider that important yourself. Moreover, I don't know if he sees her mom often, but if my mom was in town she would be a priority. I would probably not see her on VDay, but it wouldn't be impossible.", "YTA - in one breath you say you don\u2019t care about the holiday and then you flip mode to looneyville because he became available when dinner with his MOM was canceled and asked if you\u2019d like to grab something to eat?!? Dude what?", "YTA. Don't say Valentine's Day isn't a huge priority to you then get upset when he doesn't do what you want him to do on it. If you'd made your expectations for the holiday known or told him it mattered to you that would be different. \n\nAnd if Valentine's day truly doesn't mean that much to you it sounds like you have other issues you need to sort out in therapy.", "YTA - you married a guy you know hates the holiday. Didn\u2019t plan anything together and expected him to plan something for you. And the guy had plans with his mother, gets cancelled on, let\u2019s you know he wants to do something with you, and then you go off on him? Seems a bit much.", "ESH.\n\n1. You I assume communicated Valentine's was not a priority for you\n2. He has communicated his feelings on the holiday / it's not a priority for him\n3. You agreed that he could go to dinner w/ his mom (who was in town), and you declined (evidencing it is not a priority for you)\n4. Given that it's not that important of a holiday for either of you, when mom declined he went back to his typical priority (you)\n5. You got mad at him for not doing more on Valentine's - AH move there and directly contradicting your own statements. Apparently it IS important to you.\n6. He escalated the conflict when he learned this -- invalidating your feelings and dismissing that you wanted to feel special in a small, easy-to-achieve way once you told him.\n\nY'all both suck in your conflict resolution for not talking for days after and continue to act dramatically over a holiday \\*you both agreed is not a big deal.\\*", "YTA- He invited you out twice and you said no. Once before his mom cancelled and then after. I don't really understand why you're mad in the first place. It seems like you know Valentin's day isn't a big deal for him and you don't think it's one either. I don't get why you didn't make plans for the day if you were going to be mad that he didn't. All this could have been avoided if you planned something especially since it sounds like you were the one who wanted to do something. Also the man wanted to hangout with his mom like she birthed him for crying out loud. It wasn't like he was drunk watching a basketball game", "YTA make up your mind. So, do you or do you not care about it?", "NTA by a country mile.\n\nIf you're still together next year, consider booking yourself a nice staycation at a luxury resort and spa next Valentine's day (think hot tub, massages, etc.).\n\nDo not tell him where.\n\nWhen he wonders where you are, tell him you're treating yourself to some self love because you deserve it!  He'll be desperate to join you.", "ESH. Based on what you've described, it sounds like your husband was insensitive to your feelings on Valentine's Day and made you feel like a second choice. It's understandable that you were hurt and upset by this, and it seems like you communicated your feelings to him in a clear way.  \nHowever, it's also important to consider how you communicated your feelings to him. Cursing him out and being hateful may not have been the most constructive way to address the issue, and could have escalated the situation. It's important to communicate your feelings in a calm and respectful manner, even when you're upset.\n\n  \nThat being said, your husband's response to your hurt and anger was dismissive and unsympathetic. He should have acknowledged your feelings and taken responsibility for his actions, rather than belittling your emotions and blaming you for overreacting.\n\n  \nIn the end, it's up to you whether or not you want to forgive your husband and work through this issue together. It's important to prioritize open and honest communication, and to listen to each other's perspectives and feelings. But ultimately, it's not okay for your husband to dismiss or invalidate your emotions.", "YTA - so you admit that the holiday isn\u2019t a huge priority for you, yet you throw a massive tantrum that you\u2019re not doing anything for the holiday?\n\nWhy didn\u2019t *you* take the initiative and plan something? Did you tell him that you loved him at all during that day?", "yta\n\nyou say valentines day is no big deal yet you have expectations, i dont think thats fair at all.\n\nhe made plans with his mum which dont have anything to do with valentines day and when she couldnt come he asked you to go with him regardless so the reservation wasnt for nothing? i fail to see how he was being disrespectful to be honest.\n\nif you want to participate in valentines day then make your expectations clear to him. try couples therapy if you want to salvage your marriage, you two seem to have a lot of underlying problems.", "YTA", "YTA - I don't see why you're upset when you were invited and declined to join. Who else would he call for dinner?", "I'd like to clarify, I am not saying Vday is not a priority to me at all, it is. It's not at the same level as Christmas or birthdays but I do still enjoy partaking in it even if it's lowkey and not a big demonstration like some people like treat it. We always celebrate it.", "Seems like y'all have issues. \nESH.", "ESH.    You both need to grow up.", "ESH. Yeah, he fucked up. But: \n\n>It's not a huge priority for me either.\n\nAnd then\n\n>That's when I lost it. I cursed him out for essentially making me feel like 2nd choice and forgetting about me that day. Not once during the day did he even say I love you.\n\nYou obviously care for Valentine's Day. It's time to sit down and talk to him about how you actually cared for it, and you didn't realize it.", "OP, look into the concept of love languages. As in, the different love languages people speak. Check out whether your husband speaks different love language - or is inconsiderate of you. The former is a fixable problem - the latter is not.", "ESH. \n\nIt's not unreasonable to expect something from your husband on Valentine's Day, regardless of how he feels about the holiday. Valentine's Day is clearly important to you to some degree, but you need to figure out what your expectations from him are for the holiday and then clearly and calmly communicate them to him.\n\nHe can't read your mind or meet expectations he doesn't know exist. It clearly wasn't fine that he forgot about Valentine's Day, but you played it off like it was. He believes that this holiday is bullshit and you acted indifferent about it until you exploded on him. So, you basically went ballistic on him for taking you at your word.\n\nHe should respect your feelings about this holiday whether he agrees with them or not, but you first need to communicate those feelings like an adult. When you don't ask for what you need, you're setting both of you up for failure, and it's unfair to create that situation and then hold him accountable for it. \n\nThat said, it's not okay that he dismissed your feelings once he was aware it hurt you. His perspective on Valentine's Day really doesn't matter. If this \"performative bullshit holiday\" is important to you, then he should put on a performance. It's not about the holiday--it's about showing up for his wife in a way that matters to her. If he's not willing to do that once he's made aware that it matters, that's an actual problem to address.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're feelings are your feelings and he shouldn't dismiss them but give him a little grace because that blow up did come out of nowhere for a holiday that was so unimportant to you. Make sure your expectations for that day are KNOWN so that he can avoid blowing it off in the future.

Part of the problem here is you saying the day isn\u2019t that big a deal for you.  Apparently it is a big deal for you.  You were trying to match or support your husband\u2019s low opinion of the holiday and he believed you. Now he feels sandbagged.  \n\nYou may have no rebuttal for why s crass commercialization of a sentiment is important to you.\nOne reason is that a holiday designated for live and romance creates a focus on that.  Otherwise people can just live in routines without stopping to smell the roses.  \n\nFor instance, your husband could make a point of celebrating each other on another day but probably doesn\u2019t.  Most people react that way.  Do holidays do serve a have a purpose.  \n\nConsider telling him your strong reaction surprised you and made you think it through.  Explain you now realize you actually want him to let you know how much you and your life together mean to him but you don\u2019t want to feel like a beggar at the door; you want to know he feels love, affection, attraction, etc., and want to know you value him in those ways too.  \n\nTell him it doesn\u2019t have to be VDay.  It can be your wedding anniversary done up each year with enthusiasm.  Suggest the two of you planning a long weekend in a very romantic spot once a year but at a fixed time would mean a lot.\n\nThe actual holiday is a date known by so many and the value in that is people now expect themselves snd others to be reserving that day each year to express love.

When he texted her about forgetting what day it was, he either had already made dinner plans and didn't bother to mention or invite her then or he made them after talking to her without checking in with her or extending an invitation once they were made.

I can totally understand why she would feel like an afterthought when her husband asks her what she's doing for dinner after his plans fell through.", "so why is it fine for him to do it for his mom and then when she cancels treats it like asking a friend. yes it s a commercial holiday but it means something to people and he's treating how she feels like its nothing.", "L \n\nDid you even read the post?", "yes after his mom cancelled he wasnt going to invite her before that", ">I would have made it up to you but im not going to grovel and be your emotional punching bag\n\nwhat does this mean exactly", "I think her grievance is that she was not acknowledged, v-day or not.
