He has some audacity to plan a camping trip for his friends and you and then uninviting you. Also what is with the comment saying he was willing to hurt you more than he was willing to hurt his friends?  This is honestly the biggest bullet you have dodged OP.\n\nEdit: character", "He also screwed himself out of a camping trip as well which is funny in it of itself since now he still needs a babysitter if he wants to go. \n\nHonestly a good thing it happened since he\u2019s showing his true colors on who he values time with in his life. \n\nGood riddance.", "He had weeks to ask his ex to take the kids, screwed up & got the weekend wrong. Then waited until the last minute to ask his girlfriend to watch his kids so he could go camping WITHOUT her! How is that an ESH? He completely showed her how much she actually means to him with his major AH move! Plus he said \"I'm choosing to bury you instead of my friend.\" OP doesn't suck for not wanting to babysit his kids.", "IMO, YTA for your comment! She's definitely NOT TA no matter how much his birthday campng with his friends meant. What he pulled was a complete jerk move & he's TA!", "I laughed out loud at the \"Indiana Jones-sized bullet\"", "You're a complete jerk with your comment & winner of a free AH award!", ">\tHe had weeks to ask his ex to take the kids, screwed up & got the weekend wrong. \n\nWe don\u2019t know any of this.\n\n>\tThen waited until the last minute to ask his girlfriend to watch his kids so he could go camping WITHOUT her! \n\nSaid this is why he\u2019s an asshole.\n\n>\tHow is that an ESH?

In a long term relationship if it\u2019s not common for her to watch his kid she should\u2019ve just hit the bullet one time for his birthday.", "Yup.

He decided his *gf* should stay home from the camping trip because of his failure to plan rather than canceling the trip to take care of *his own kids*.

He did you the favor of taking the trash out. \n\nIt is absolutely ridiculous that the thought \"it came down to hurting my friends or hurting you\" and choose you ever crossed his mind. You had every right to be upset. Can you imagine how this relationship would play out if it kept going? If you two had a kid together? How he would put his friends over you again and again? how he would pawn off the kids to you while he did fuck all?\n\nBe happy he removed himself from your life. \n\nNTA", "You're NTA.

Did he actually *try* to find a babysitter? Or was he just hinting that he wanted you to babysit? \n\nIf this was strictly a boy's trip (and it wasn't his birthday) I would say YTA, because we do need time away (the same way women do...INB4, if someone's  GF/wife wants to take a trip with her girls, BF/DH should encourage her to go), but since SO's were included, it kinda seems sus.\n\nIn this case, BF was definitely an AH for not telling his boys that the camping trip was off, because plans change. 99.9% chance you're  NTA", "NTA\n\nHe did you a favour by dumping you because he just saw you as a built in baby sitter", "NTA.

Go forth and live happy \ud83d\ude0a  NTA btw.", "The fact that he couldn\u2019t understand why is a very big deal.", "I disagree.", "This is the first thing that came to my mind.
