But I would get treated like shit and was often told that I'd \"get over it.\"\n\nThis break up is a blessing in disguise. P.S. it's even more bullshit that his friends significant others will be there, but you're being excluded. Not only is it bullshit, but it also sounds sus af and makes me wonder if there's someone attending this trip that he didn't want you to find out about.", "NTA!!!! Girl you dodged a freaking bullet with that one!", "NTA and you just ditched 200 pounds of dead weight.

You dodged a bullet with that one. Go find yourself a REAL MAN, that will treat your relationship as a partnership, not free daycare. Looks like he didn't get to go camping, or he found someone to watch the kids that he didn't bother to ask in the first place rather than throwing them on you. What's more, why not take the kids camping with him?", "I'm thinking you dodged a bullet...", "I am confused on why he broke up with you the next day. It means he still can't go on the trip solo with friends because he still doesn't have someone to watch his two kids while he is gone! I don't know what he hoped to accomplish with the break up but I am laughing at how much he didn't think this one through. NTA", "NTA\n\nGOOD RIDDANCE", "NTA. Good riddance to him and his friends.", "no, he is the ah", "NTA. Also you dodged a bullet.", "NTA. When my husband and I first started dating, we both had kids. There were events we skipped because we had kids, but that's the key here- WE skipped. \n\nThe only time I ever had his kids without him was when I got off work first or when he was studying for law school. \n\nFind someone who loves spending time with you, and chooses you over their friends.", "I love it when the trash takes itself to the curb.  NTA", " NTA- he probably had someone else he wanted to go with. I assume after he gets back from camping he\u2019ll try and get back with you and I hope you say no if he does. He doesn\u2019t value you more then a babysitter", "NTA. At least you know where you stood with him. Better to find out now.", "Trash does take itself out sometimes. \ud83d\udc4d", "4. He bitched for TWO WEEKS that he \u201ccoUlDn\u2019T fInD a SiTteR\u201d while he had 2 fricken weeks to literally hire a sitter\u2026.", "\"We love each other and I thought you'd want to help me!\"\n\nThat's some serious gaslighting there.  Run for your life.", "GOOD RIDDANCE TO BAD TRASH", "I had to read that part twice. Like, wth?
