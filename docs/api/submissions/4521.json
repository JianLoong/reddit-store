Well long story short one of the kids (F8) took my phone out of my hand while I was on it. \n\nI tried to grab my phone back, but she was fast and ran away from me. Well she ended up going onto my Snapchat and seeing some pictures that I had taken for my boyfriend (it wasn't my genitals BTW. It was just my boobs, ass, and some pics of me in lingerie). She dropped my phone and ran to her mother and told her what she saw. \n\nHer mother came up to me and told me that she was very mad that I had thoes pictures in the first place and was even more mad that her daughter was able to see them so easily. I tried to explain what happened but she wouldn't listen to me and called me a creep. \n\nI ended up leaving the party in tears because I've known these people since I was born and I felt bad.
