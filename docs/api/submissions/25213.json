I would not consider myself a cancer anything.  There is no comparison.", "I'm going to get down voted for this, but NTA.\n\nShe could talk about the scare, the emotions, her journey and how she felt about it all, but to call it a survival... Someone who truly survived cancer would probably raise their eyebrows to this.\n\nCancer is not something desirable or a light topic to talk about, so I really think your friend that has the back pain needs your unconditional love and support, not someone else's story and proclaiming everything is going to be ok (unfortunately not the friend, not you, not even Sarah can know that)", "I\u2019m astounded by all of the Y-T-A here. Like did y\u2019all read the post she had a small singular lesion that was easily removed and by saying that it \u201cdestroyed her life\u201d she\u2019s clearly overstating how bad her cancer was to overshadow someone else\u2019s upcoming surgery.

Getting a mole removed that turned out to be cancerous and required no extra treatment is not a big deal. Getting a stage one diagnosis with an excellent prognosis should not scare you. If you are around medicine and actual disease a lot you will understand the difference of getting one surgery and having stage 3 or 4 and truly not knowing if it'll be cured. Or getting a slow growing cancer that won't kill you, like certain prostate cancers in older men. My mom had radiation for stage one breast cancer and she always had an excellent prognosis and just went about her usual business. She would never call herself a cancer survivor because it was never going to kill her. \n\nIt's like having a cold versus having cystic fibrosis.

You aren't saying she didn't go through cancer. You're saying that her situation isn't comparable to someone who could possibly have some abdominal cancer that could cost them their lives. People get very sensitive when cancer comes up but realistically skin cancer is incredibly common and has a 99% survival rate for localized cancer (I know people die of cancer but in terms of average most people survive). I'm sure she was scared about having cancer but logically, with a small mark on her thigh it was pretty obvious the cancer was caught early on and after her diagnosis the doctors definitely told her that they would remove the cancer and she would fully recover. I totally understand how stressful and scary that situation can be but it's just not comparable to people who go throughout harsh treatment and are hospitalized.", "NTA.

I am not a cancer survivor. My mother and sister died from cancer, one of my friends had her breast removed, my brother had cancer, my friend and my brother are cancer survivors, mine was an inconvenience and only thought about when someone asks about the scar. No big deal, I didn\u2019t really suffer from it, I wasn\u2019t sick in anyway nor did I have to endure chemo or radiotherapy.", "She did survive cancer technically, and it was luckily caught early, but to say that it destroyed her life and that his pain is probably cancer crosses a line. NTA for that.\n\nedit: typo", "NTA I had a nickel-sized abnormal lesion removed several years ago and while your sister can probably relate to the worry that someone could experience while waiting for test results, I think that it sounds like a stretch to refer to herself as a cancer survivor in a traditional sense because it implies she\u2019s experienced adverse health and/or chemotherapy. In my experience it was about two weeks between the biopsy and removal, my overall health didn\u2019t feel like it\u2019d decreased, and the hardest part was aftercare for the wound \u2014 vastly less than what I think of when I think of a cancer survivor. If anything, she should give context to avoid seeming disingenuous.", "NTA. My father did this after having precancerous cells removed with a simple ablation.

I had cancer a few years back. I had a total hysterectomy, but never had to do anything else. However, it was very close to becoming metastasized. It was an outpatient procedure. Am I a cancer survivor or not?\n\nI usually tell people that I didn't have a battle with cancer, it was more of a tiff.", "NTA\n\nMany members of my immediate family have had cancer, some have successfully beaten it while others have not.

I\u2019m happy for her it did not turn into full blown cancer because skin cancer is no joke. But she did not go through major disfiguring surgery or radiation therapy or chemo. She needs to sit down and shut up.\n\nYou rightfully called her out. She does want sympathy and attention and it\u2019s not cool. You won\u2019t be the last person to say something to her. I really hope someone who beat cancer after a long illness puts her in her place one day. Or maybe she should volunteer with a cancer organization so she can be grateful.", "NTA. A cancer survivor is someone who beat the odds by fighting it along with the extensive treatment. It's literally a war for the person and it really takes someone who is extremely strong to survive it. My dad has had skin cancers for his entire life and he would never compare what he has to someone who has gone through chemo or intense surgery. They were nothing more than an inconvenience to him. Obviously, if they go untreated, they can metastasize and turn into full blown cancer.

I gotta confess even the cancer docs were a little confused about the mutation.\n\nI welcome people to the survivors club and leave it at that.

No. What a drama queen.", "Info: do you know what type of skin cancer she had? If it was a basal cell then she is the asshole. If worse than that then you are the assshole.

They are two very different experiences.\nAdded in \"skin\" to clarify.", "I don\u2019t know where to stand here. I\u2019ve had skin cancer and had MOHs surgery to remove it. I currently have incurable brain cancer and have undergone several brain surgeries, chemo and radiation. Yes, one cancer is more serious and has given me a 10 year prognosis, but that doesn\u2019t make my skin cancer experience any less terrifying. I cried, was scared, did not know what the future held. To be diagnosed with cancer regardless of where it is, how serious it is, it is a terrifying, life altering and usually mentally draining experience.

See is a cancer survivor. Also, depending on what type, it more often than not, reoccur. \n\nNo, she didn\u2019t have months of chemo or radiation but she still had to go through the procedure of having it removed and tested. And trust me, the stress of waiting up to if not more than a week to find out what\u2019s going on is beyond what you apparently understand. \n\nRight now you\u2019re other friend is going through the exact same thing. How can you have compassion for one friend but not the other?", "technically nta but you went outside societal norms. everyone frowns upon her behind her back but you\u2019re not supposed to say it out loud", "YTA. From the moment she was diagnosed to when she was told that it was the local and non-spreading kind would be incredibly stressful.\n\nA friend of mine at to get part of her thyroid removed.  Day surgery not significant.  But until they determined the type of tumour she was an emotional wreck.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to gate keep another persons experience.", "YTA. She had cancer. She survived it. She is a cancer survivor.", "I'm going to go with ESH.\n\nSo the part I think you are discounting is the phase between when you are told you have cancer and the time it takes to assess what your prognosis is.\n\nA friend of mine was diagnosed with Lymphoma in December.  He then went three weeks (due to the holidays) trying to find out what this meant.  You Google Lymphoma and it's suggesting maybe 3-5 years to live. \n\nSo for three weeks he's scrambling to get a will together, to try to go over all the details in his life to make sure if he dies his family will be okay.  He's checking his life insurance, he's making sure everything is spelled out.  It was pretty terrifying.  He's trying to just compress a lifetime of moments into 3 weeks with his kids.  He's hoping he might get closer to a decade just to see his kids graduate HS.\n\nThen the tests come back and he has this obscure form of Lymphoma that's not aggressive and has something like a 10% chance of progressing into a more aggressive form in the next 30 years (he's 50).  It's not anything that needs to be treated.  Basically there's a 90% chance it doesn't shorten his life at all.\n\nSo my point is, you are completely discounting the fear that comes with a diagnosis like this.  If it was 5 minutes from being told she had skin cancer to 'we can just cut it off' probably no big deal, but if it's a few weeks it can be a real scary experience.\n\nIn that sense, she may be able to empathize with your friend more than you are giving her credit.\n\nWith that said, your friend is definitely selling it a bit too hard.  Despite the concern the C word brings, it ended up being super minor.  When that happens you count your blessings and feel for the people who really are facing a death sentence.", "YTA. She had cancer and survived. There are many treatments for cancer, many of which do not involve chemotherapy or radiation. She was saved by her treatment because without it, it would have become life threatening. Gatekeeping is not a good look. Now, if she had been intentionally drawing attention to herself, rather than honestly trying to encourage your friend, it might have been an asshole move, but she is still a cancer survivor.", "Someone recently told me that my cancer \"didn't count\" because I didn't lose all of my hair during chemotherapy.\n\nYTA", "YTA, had cancer, had it removed. Pretty cut & dry. Seems like everyone there agree with the friend too.", "Yta", "ESH\n\nLook, if she was making someone else's diagnosis and experience about her, she's definitely an AH, no doubt.\n\nThat said, I don't think it's up to you to police her language like that. If it upsets you that she might misrepresent herself to people that's something to talk about one on one at a later time. Let her know that lots of people have to go through chemotherapy, radiation and other types of ongoing treatments that have a whole slew of their own side effects, and that's typically what people associate with the term cancer survivor, so she might want to just share the facts of her experience and her emotions and experience without necessarily calling herself a cancer survivor.\n\nIf she pushes back and tells you that you're wrong and that she is going to keep calling herself that then it's not your place to do anything else about it. You don't have to hang out with her, but since she did have cancerous cells removed she is not technically lying and you won't win this battle.\n\nYou also don't really know everything she went through necessarily. Maybe there was more to the story that she never told you.\n\nI wouldn't call myself a Covid survivor because it was so mild, but I did have it. I wouldn't dream of telling someone else with Covid whether they could call themselves that. It's a subjective term.", "I had a colonoscopy and had two pre-cancerous polyps removed. I am a pre-cancer survivor. Of course, I may just shorten that to cancer survivor.", "YTA she had cancer. She is a cancer survivor.", "YTA.\n\nEveryone is taking you at face value that she went through a quick removal and it was never thought about again. In reality, it seems a lot more likely you don\u2019t actually have any clue how this impacted her. There are so many additional factors that could have come into play for how she coped with it, how it hurt her mental state, etc, no matter how \u201cbig\u201d or \u201csmall\u201d her cancer was.\n\nSecondly, wild to me that everyone is assuming your friend was making your other friend\u2019s cancer about her? It sounds much more like she was trying to empathize with and reassure him, and you made things contentious for no reason. If you genuinely thought it was inappropriate, you could have had a conversation with her one-on-one later. If this is how you react to things, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if she never confided her real struggles with learning she had cancer with you.", "YTA. My aunt has had skin cancer and had fairly straightforward procedures. She still had cancer. My uncle had prostate cancer and had it removed. He also had cancer. Both are cancer survivors.", "YTA - you have clearly never waited for biopsy results. Any cancer is cancer.  Once you\u2019ve had it you wonder Where else in my body is it hiding?", "YTA. Some cancer survivors are luckier than others,  but that doesn't mean they didn't get the scared feelings. First the uncertainty \"is this something I should see a doctor about\". Then the initial tests and the high stress waiting to hear. Then the news: it's cancer. The doctor says it looks like we caught it  early and then goes on to talk about the treatment. Meanwhile,  you've already Googled it and you know both the 95% and the other 5%. It finally turns out after weeks of waiting and doing, it really was caught early,  the miracles of modern science and all are on your side. Now you just have to follow up with skin checks every 6 months,  hoping that slick spot at the small of your back isn't another lesion. You are a luck survivor,  but dammit,  you are still a survivor who has had those heart pounding moments in the doctors office, those high anxiety weeks waiting to hear, those terrifying Google searches. Maybe you didn't go though chemo, but you have empathy and experiences to offer, including the very needed experience that the word cancer is not a death sentence and sometimes doesn't even require chemo or radiation. Some cancer patients can find hope hearing from a lucky survivor.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m a \u201creal\u201d cancer survivor, by your definition. I survived it and still have to get cancerous cells removed every few months to prevent it from coming back full force. \n\nYour friend is literally by definition a cancer survivor. She had cancer and she lived. That\u2019s so amazing. For too many people, they\u2019re not as lucky. But just because she was lucky, it doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t suffer. Even just getting diagnosed with it is earth-shattering and terrifying. I still get flash backs to that day in the doctor\u2019s office; I remember that so much more vividly than the actual treatment. It\u2019s scary and it\u2019s traumatizing. And she\u2019s allowed to talk about it. \n\nYour friend shouldn\u2019t have tried to tell your other friend that he\u2019ll be fine, but it\u2019s quite clear she was trying to be positive and show him that she empathizes with what he\u2019s going through to some degree. She didn\u2019t go about it the right way from what it sounds like, but there was nothing malicious or wrong with what she said. \n\nIf you hate hearing your friend talk about her experience so much, then I suggest leaving her alone and allowing her to find someone who is a bit more supportive and understanding. Some therapy so you can figure out why this makes you so angry may also be a good choice.", "YTA- Oh mighty cancer gatekeeper, is having my kidney removed with renal cell carcinoma serious enough for me to be considered a cancer survior?

Don't discount somebody's experience.\n\nI had Moh's surgery on the tip of my nose for a basal carcinoma. This was caught early.

It got infected after the surgery. It was extremely pustulous, swelled and split the stitches. It was extremely painful. I had to have both oral antibiotics and topical antibiotics. I had a lot of anxiety about how it was going to look. It's better but it will never be smooth or like it was.\n\nI knew I wasn't going to die and I don't consider myself a cancer survivor.

Then please for one second imagine when they came back with the biopsy results and said it\u2019s turns out it was indeed cancerous can you imagine the thoughts running through her head? Yes her cancer wasn\u2019t life threatening It probably ruined her life for a week or a month. But that week or month probably felt like a lifetime. No she hasn\u2019t had to technically fight cancer yet but she did have cancer and she did survive and she does know exactly what it feels like to go into a doctors office not know what is going on and being told it\u2019s cancer.

So yes YTA.", "I\u2019m going against everyone here and say YTA, but please read my whole explanation.\n\nI understand why you disagree with your friend saying that she is a survivor. I truly do. I got a few pre-cancerous dark spots removed and would never call myself a survivor. However, reducing the emotional shock of a cancer diagnosis to the severity of the treatment is a horrible thing to do.

But in no way did she battle for her life. \n\nThere was no long fight with strange drugs or huge radiation machines. \n\nThere was no need for her to pretend to be strong bc your loved ones are horrible at pretending the same....so you have to be strong for them. \n\nThere was no watching your hair fall out ( it actually hurts btw), or your skin cook frome the inside out.\n\nShe did not struggle with the unknown.  Having blood tests week after week. .. month after month.  Waiting for numbers, blood counts, tumor markers.    \n\nSo no... you are NTA.  \n  She was not saying...\" I have been through the shit and fear and battle, and you're not alone.\"   This is why we identify as survivors. To let others know they can fight and to give them support and hope. \n\nShe was looking for sympathy and attention.  And it's disgusting.", "Yes. The \u2018everything will be fine\u2019 thing is well-intentioned reassurance\u2026 but you don\u2019t know. I still feel guilty thirty years later for this - as a teenager, my mother had breast cancer and it was caught very very early, and dealt with comparatively easily. So when a friend of mine at school told me her mother had breast cancer, I was reassuring and \u2018it\u2019ll all be fine, my mum had it too, easily dealt with\u2019, because that was my experience and I hadn\u2019t seen enough of the world to realise quite what a lucky escape that was. I still wish I hadn\u2019t said any of that, because I was wrong, and my friend lost her mother before she\u2019d even finished school.", "While I'm inclined to agree,  I think the friend may possibly have had a type of melanoma,  which is a pretty serious cancer if left untreated.  If that is the case, she may have had to go through more care and scare than you might guess.  Melanoma kills.  Other skin cancers are generally pretty trivial.   This opinion is based on both working in cancer research and recently being diagnosed with a \"legitimate\" cancer.", "I agree. I had roughly the same thing she did. It was scary for a month, waiting for the results and wondering if it was malignant. And the surgery, for me at least, was several inches deep, so it definitely hurt and took a few weeks to heal, and I have a chunk scar on my shoulder, but to compare it to surviving cancer is a slap in the face to actual cancer survivors who go through chemotherapy/radiation + organ  surgery and actually face death (not a scare).", "I have scrolled and still haven't seen a single  y t a comment so... op is obviously NTA", "lol, so apt! I love this analogy!", "Completely disagree. There\u2019s no difference removing a single lesson whether it\u2019s basal, squamous, or melanoma.

I had the one surgery that removed an ovary and the tumor on it and boom, done. Cancer survivor indicates a fight that\u2019s been fought. Mine was more like a cancer mugging- over very quickly and I lost an ovary but I kept my life.", "Thank you! Exactly my thoughts when I wrote the comment. The idea isn't to gatekeep on who can call themselves cancer survivors and who can't but rather that Sarah jumped with the story oversimplifying things that could go really wrong for other types of cancer (I do actually know someone who started with having bad back pains and they were diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, unfortunately it will be a long journey with question marks about the result) and making it (maybe unknowingly) about herself.\n\nThe sick friend needs support, being *listened* to when they express their feelings and emotions, not being told \"everything will be alright because for me it was too\"", "Ah, you're reminding me of how much my scalp hurt when my hair was falling out. Ended up shaving the rest off so I could scour my scalp with a soft body brush", ">That waking up and being told it\u2019s cancer but that I had to wait for 2 weeks to find out what kind,\n\nYou must have had some AMAZING medical personnel.  Normally no doctor in their right mind in removal of a tumor will tell a patient that they have cancer BEFORE it is sent for microscopic examination.  The potential for malpractice in such a comment to a patient when it could also have been a benign tumor vs cancerous especially when \"waking up\" implying you were under some anesthetic procedure and could misunderstand the words is great.  Of course maybe you aren't in the US.\n\nAs for my own battle: I found a lump in my left breast and I still didn't get an answer for 3 weeks that it was cancerous even though it had developed from nothing seen in a mammogram (it was completely clean) to less than 60 days later I had a firm irregular lump.  Zero familial or genetic predisposition to breast cancer.  But still... 3 weeks is what it took from me finding a lump to getting my Nottingham Score of 9 with Triple Negative Breast Cancer and then starting Chemo the next week.\n\nI don't know what you go through now that you had your tumor removed and were lucky (yes I said it, **lucky**) enough to avoid radiation and chemo for your treatment protocol.  But yes, some of us that say we are a survivor (I try to avoid that title) and hear stories like yours and say you have no clue is because you really don't.\n\nSure you had an emotional rollercoaster as anyone who has had to face even the ***potential*** of cancer does.\n\n>if you don\u2019t have chemo or radiation means you aren\u2019t a cancer survivor?\n\nIt's not that specifically that makes me say you aren't a survivor and yet it's the experience with those that makes one realize what it means to actually survive the ordeal of cancer. My life has changed in ways you can't even comprehend by your own story admission.\n\nThe best description of chemo I ever heard: they put into you the worst chemicals they can to try and kill the cancer in a bid that the same chemicals don't kill you first.  I got ***lucky*** that the first mix they tried actually worked as I was warned there is NO SET METHOD for triple negative breast cancer because there is no definitive reason why it happens.  It's not like the genetic or hormonal ones that have a set protocol with excellent results for remission.\n\nBesides the immediate effects of chemo: the weight loss, hair loss, nausea, appetite loss; I have ongoing repercussions to the treatment.  To this day, I still live in chemo fog 4 years on, have mammograms and ultrasounds every 6 months, it triggered a heterozygous genetic disorder that can now kill me if I don't take meds for **THE REST OF MY LIFE** that already came close to killing me twice.  \n\nPre cancer I took 3 meds daily, post cancer and treatments I take ***12***!!!  Plus since every chemo session killed your immune system and essentially both RBC/WBC production, you got a special shot 24-48 hours after your chemo treatment that was to cause your marrow to kick into overdrive.  Have you ever felt deep bone pain?  No amount of pain relief pill stops it and you curl into a ball wishing you would die instead of having to feel it.\n\nThen came the lumpectomy and don't mistake me for easily admitting *I am* ***lucky*** I just had that and some lymph nodes removed instead of a full mastectomy.  Yet that has left me with a limited motion range of my left arm due to scarring and lymphedema.  \n\nThen, I had to go through radiation 5 times a week for 6 weeks. I couldn't do week 7 because the radiation burns were so severe that I was under constant threat of infection coupled with the fact that chemo decimated my immune system!  I have permanent discoloration, scarring and the dots that they use to line you up in that machine.\n\nI went thousands into debt and didn't have a GoFundMe to help.  No one except for my medical professionals, my then SO, immediate family and 5 friends knew what I was going through.  It destroyed my 15 year relationship because he became turned off by my bald head, bad skin and damaged smile so all intimacy died.\n\nEven now I don't share my previous battle with people outside of here often because how terrified I am to this day of my cancer coming back since triple negative has the greatest recurrence rates of the 3 types within the first 5 years, is the hardest to treat, the most likely to metastasize to lungs liver and brain and you are constantly reminded you aren't cured but just in remission.\n\nThe issue for me with your post mainly though is you don't come across as grateful that you got away with a pill, a tumor removal and the win in getting into a clinic trial which probably saved you some $.  You come across as a pick me, pity me.  So go ahead and call yourself a survivor if it makes you feel better.  Wear it like a badge and put it all over your car and tell others what they need to think about you being a *\"Survivor\"*.  \n\nBut I don't see you or the other girl this post is about that as survivors because everyday I struggle to ***survive*** with everything cancer and its treatments of chemo and radiation has left me with; a broken body that even if cancer never comes back, has now shortened my life expectancy compared if I never had it or the treatments.\n\nWhat makes a person a survivor is that even when their cancer literally took away ***EVERYTHING*** they fought back and have the will to still fight every day and are thankful for everyday that they are still here.  Yet, I still don't ever say I am a cancer survivor even though I know I am because I refuse to let my cancer take any more than it already has and let it define my life.\n\nI stopped focusing on *\"cancer survivor\"* because I would rather be known as an amazing aunt, a doting daughter/granddaughter, a great girlfriend, a treasured friend, a person who will persevere against the odds and hopefully next year a college graduate.  \n\nBut again, if it makes ***YOU*** feel better to wrap yourself up in the survivor mantle and definition I guess that is your right.  Just don't be shocked if you deal with a lot of people like me who read your store and this OP and say you don't know what it truly means to be a ***cancer survivor***.", "Sounds like your melanoma had progressed, not that it was a single lesson that had to be excised.", "You're not the asshole.

Yes, technically she had cancer. But to claim that she knows what your friend is going through.... not even close!  \n\nI have a cousin who had an undetected cyst on her scalp near the base of her skull. It grew inward instead of outward, and ended up putting some pressure on her brain and the arteries in the area. She complained of headaches for a year and the doctors blew it off, but eventually the pressure from the growing cyst caused her to have a seizure. She did have to have surgery to remove the cyst but they did not cut into her brain, just the scalp skin on her head, and the cyst was not cancer. But 30 year later she still  tries to blame every one of her grating personality issues on THE BRAIN TUMOR. Literally every person she interacts with will eventually be offended by something horrible my cousin says or does. Then she tells them, \"I'm sorry, I had a brain tumor and brain surgery and the doctors say the brain tumor messed up some stuff in my head.\"    This leads everyone to assume she had brain CANCER and they feel sorry for her, but it is totally a lie. When people find out the truth, they are pissed that she is implying Brain Cancer and expecting sympathy.

That's all well and good for you, but OPs friend isn't wrong to say she is a cancer survivor. She survived because it was caught and treated early. I have a friend who caught breast cancer at stage 1, chose to treat with mastectomy and reconstruction and was in her words, lucky in that she didn't need radiation and chemo..but the reality is, she had cancer, she treated it and survived....aka a cancer survivor. \nIf ops friend left that skin cancer untreated what do you reckon would have happened? If assume it would get worse, spread and kill her. \nSo just because she was lucky and found and treated it early enough and it didn't make her sick enough doesn't mean it wasn't cancer. \nA cancer diagnosis can mentally fuck someone up, regardless of its survival rates, treatment or whatever. \nOP.YTA just because you think it's misleading and over dramatic doesn't mean it is for her.
