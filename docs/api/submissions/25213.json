I would not consider myself a cancer anything.  There is no comparison.", "I'm going to get down voted for this, but NTA.\n\nShe could talk about the scare, the emotions, her journey and how she felt about it all, but to call it a survival... Someone who truly survived cancer would probably raise their eyebrows to this.\n\nCancer is not something desirable or a light topic to talk about, so I really think your friend that has the back pain needs your unconditional love and support, not someone else's story and proclaiming everything is going to be ok (unfortunately not the friend, not you, not even Sarah can know that)", "I\u2019m astounded by all of the Y-T-A here. Like did y\u2019all read the post she had a small singular lesion that was easily removed and by saying that it \u201cdestroyed her life\u201d she\u2019s clearly overstating how bad her cancer was to overshadow someone else\u2019s upcoming surgery.

Sarah is being a little dramatic.", "NTA People are dumb and think all cancers are the same. Getting a mole removed that turned out to be cancerous and required no extra treatment is not a big deal. Getting a stage one diagnosis with an excellent prognosis should not scare you. If you are around medicine and actual disease a lot you will understand the difference of getting one surgery and having stage 3 or 4 and truly not knowing if it'll be cured. Or getting a slow growing cancer that won't kill you, like certain prostate cancers in older men. My mom had radiation for stage one breast cancer and she always had an excellent prognosis and just went about her usual business. She would never call herself a cancer survivor because it was never going to kill her. \n\nIt's like having a cold versus having cystic fibrosis.

You aren't saying she didn't go through cancer. You're saying that her situation isn't comparable to someone who could possibly have some abdominal cancer that could cost them their lives. People get very sensitive when cancer comes up but realistically skin cancer is incredibly common and has a 99% survival rate for localized cancer (I know people die of cancer but in terms of average most people survive). I'm sure she was scared about having cancer but logically, with a small mark on her thigh it was pretty obvious the cancer was caught early on and after her diagnosis the doctors definitely told her that they would remove the cancer and she would fully recover. I totally understand how stressful and scary that situation can be but it's just not comparable to people who go throughout harsh treatment and are hospitalized.", "NTA. I had three early cancer moles/spots removed and one was on my head. I\u2019d never say I\u2019m a cancer survivor because the cancer never had time to take hold and I never had to go to war with it. Neither did your friend", "NTA.\nI actually have a pre-cancerous mole on my face that I'm getting removed in two weeks. So I should go around telling everyone I have cancer? Give me a break. What an insult to those who actually fought that battle.", "NTA, I get skin cancers removed on nearly a yearly basis, one was a malignant melanoma so took two goes to cut all the cancer out as it had gone around my bone. I am not a cancer survivor. My mother and sister died from cancer, one of my friends had her breast removed, my brother had cancer, my friend and my brother are cancer survivors, mine was an inconvenience and only thought about when someone asks about the scar. No big deal, I didn\u2019t really suffer from it, I wasn\u2019t sick in anyway nor did I have to endure chemo or radiotherapy.", "She did survive cancer technically, and it was luckily caught early, but to say that it destroyed her life and that his pain is cancer crosses a line. NTA for that.", "NTA I had a nickel-sized abnormal lesion removed several years ago and while your sister can probably relate to the worry that someone could experience while waiting for test results, I think that it sounds like a stretch to refer to herself as a cancer survivor in a traditional sense because it implies she\u2019s experienced adverse health and/or chemotherapy. In my experience it was about two weeks between the biopsy and removal, my overall health didn\u2019t feel like it\u2019d decreased, and the hardest part was aftercare for the wound \u2014 vastly less than what I think of when I think of a cancer survivor. If anything, she should give context to avoid seeming disingenuous.", "NTA. My father did this after having precancerous cells removed with a simple ablation. While another family member was going through major surgery and toxic and debilitating treatments for cancer. He would try to bring it back to his nothing bullshit and say \u201cyea, cancer sucks\u201d like he had any fucking idea.  I\u2019ve had worse bikini waxes than what he went through.", "Sooo... I had cancer a few years back. I had a total hysterectomy, but never had to do anything else. However, it was very close to becoming metastasized. It was an outpatient procedure. Am I a cancer survivor or not?\n\nI usually tell people that I didn't have a battle with cancer, it was more of a tiff.", "NTA\n\nMany members of my immediate family have had cancer, some have successfully beaten it while others have not. None of them go around talking about it at all. They certainly don\u2019t brag they beat cancer.\n\nYour friend had a scare, that\u2019s all. I\u2019m happy for her it did not turn into full blown cancer because skin cancer is no joke. But she did not go through major disfiguring surgery or radiation therapy or chemo. She needs to sit down and shut up.\n\nYou rightfully called her out. She does want sympathy and attention and it\u2019s not cool. You won\u2019t be the last person to say something to her. I really hope someone who beat cancer after a long illness puts her in her place one day. Or maybe she should volunteer with a cancer organization so she can be grateful.", "NTA. A cancer survivor is someone who beat the odds by fighting it along with the extensive treatment. It's literally a war for the person and it really takes someone who is extremely strong to survive it. My dad has had skin cancers for his entire life and he would never compare what he has to someone who has gone through chemo or intense surgery. They were nothing more than an inconvenience to him. Obviously, if they go untreated, they can metastasize and turn into full blown cancer.  Your friend is being misguided in her method of trying to make someone feel better about their potential cancer, but she's also doing it for attention to herself.", "NTA, only because of the \u201cIt destroyed her life\u201d comment. No it didn\u2019t.", "NTA  I have a rare cancer and was told upfront that it is treatable but not beatable.  Diagnosed and underwent radiation in 2013.  Then again last year.  First round burned a hole in my beard and I wound up shaving it off.  Last round came back a little more aggressive and the radiation adjusted my hairline and removed my widows peak.  I gotta confess even the cancer docs were a little confused about the mutation.\n\nI welcome people to the survivors club and leave it at that.

A small pre-cancer skin lesion needing no treatment does not make you a cancer survivor nor would it destroy you life!! Maybe an afternoon while it was being removed. But destroy her life?? No. What a drama queen.", "Info: do you know what type of cancer she had? If it was a basal cell then she is the asshole. If worse than that then you are the assshole. My mom had about 30 basal cells thoughout her life. My father in law died of melanoma. They are two very different experiences.", "I don\u2019t know where to stand here. I\u2019ve had skin cancer and had MOHs surgery to remove it. I currently have incurable brain cancer and have undergone several brain surgeries, chemo and radiation. Yes, one cancer is more serious and has given me a 10 year prognosis, but that doesn\u2019t make my skin cancer experience any less terrifying. I cried, was scared, did not know what the future held. To be diagnosed with cancer regardless of where it is, how serious it is, it is a terrifying, life altering and usually mentally draining experience.

Am I a survivor?", "NTA", "NTA. I found out I had skin cancer on my face two weeks before my wedding, and while it certainly didn\u2019t destroy my life, it did cut my honeymoon short.

She had to have a spot removed and that\u2019s it. please help her get some perspective so she can stop being such an AH.", "NTA.", "NTA. My brother had skin cancer on his ear and they had to remove half his ear. I had a tiny breast lump that was basically removed by the biopsy.  Few weeks of radiation, done.

What do you think this pedantic correction will achieve?\n\nYTA", "YTA. Maybe the way she talks about it seems overly dramatic but skin cancer is no joke.

I\u2019ve nursed dozens of people through all stages of cancer at my job before switching to the er and I\u2019ve seen the worst of the worst. \n\nYou know what I\u2019d say about your friend?  See is a cancer survivor. Also, depending on what type, it more often than not, reoccur. \n\nNo, she didn\u2019t have months of chemo or radiation but she still had to go through the procedure of having it removed and tested. And trust me, the stress of waiting up to if not more than a week to find out what\u2019s going on is beyond what you apparently understand. \n\nRight now you\u2019re other friend is going through the exact same thing. How can you have compassion for one friend but not the other?", "technically nta but you went outside societal norms. everyone frowns upon her behind her back but you\u2019re not supposed to say it out loud", "YTA. From the moment she was diagnosed to when she was told that it was the local and non-spreading kind would be incredibly stressful.\n\nA friend of mine at to get part of her thyroid removed.  Day surgery not significant.  But until they determined the type of tumour she was an emotional wreck.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to gate keep another persons experience.", "YTA. She had cancer. She survived it. She is a cancer survivor.", "I'm going to go with ESH.\n\nSo the part I think you are discounting is the phase between when you are told you have cancer and the time it takes to assess what your prognosis is.\n\nA friend of mine was diagnosed with Lymphoma in December.  He then went three weeks (due to the holidays) trying to find out what this meant.  You Google Lymphoma and it's suggesting maybe 3-5 years to live. \n\nSo for three weeks he's scrambling to get a will together, to try to go over all the details in his life to make sure if he dies his family will be okay.  He's checking his life insurance, he's making sure everything is spelled out.  It was pretty terrifying.  He's trying to just compress a lifetime of moments into 3 weeks with his kids.  He's hoping he might get closer to a decade just to see his kids graduate HS.\n\nThen the tests come back and he has this obscure form of Lymphoma that's not aggressive and has something like a 10% chance of progressing into a more aggressive form in the next 30 years (he's 50).  It's not anything that needs to be treated.  Basically there's a 90% chance it doesn't shorten his life at all.\n\nSo my point is, you are completely discounting the fear that comes with a diagnosis like this.  If it was 5 minutes from being told she had skin cancer to 'we can just cut it off' probably no big deal, but if it's a few weeks it can be a real scary experience.\n\nIn that sense, she may be able to empathize with your friend more than you are giving her credit.\n\nWith that said, your friend is definitely selling it a bit too hard.  Despite the concern the C word brings, it ended up being super minor.  When that happens you count your blessings and feel for the people who really are facing a death sentence.", "YTA. She had cancer and survived. There are many treatments for cancer, many of which do not involve chemotherapy or radiation. She was saved by her treatment because without it, it would have become life threatening. Gatekeeping is not a good look. Now, if she had been intentionally drawing attention to herself, rather than honestly trying to encourage your friend, it might have been an asshole move, but she is still a cancer survivor.", "Someone recently told me that my cancer \"didn't count\" because I didn't lose all of my hair during chemotherapy.\n\nYTA", "YTA, had cancer, had it removed. Pretty cut & dry. Seems like everyone there agree with the friend too.", "Yta", "ESH\n\nLook, if she was making someone else's diagnosis and experience about her, she's definitely an AH, no doubt.\n\nThat said, I don't think it's up to you to police her language like that. If it upsets you that she might misrepresent herself to people that's something to talk about one on one at a later time. Let her know that lots of people have to go through chemotherapy, radiation and other types of ongoing treatments that have a whole slew of their own side effects, and that's typically what people associate with the term cancer survivor, so she might want to just share the facts of her experience and her emotions and experience without necessarily calling herself a cancer survivor.\n\nIf she pushes back and tells you that you're wrong and that she is going to keep calling herself that then it's not your place to do anything else about it. You don't have to hang out with her, but since she did have cancerous cells removed she is not technically lying and you won't win this battle.\n\nYou also don't really know everything she went through necessarily. Maybe there was more to the story that she never told you.\n\nI wouldn't call myself a Covid survivor because it was so mild, but I did have it. I wouldn't dream of telling someone else with Covid whether they could call themselves that. It's a subjective term.", "I had a colonoscopy and had two pre-cancerous polyps removed. I am a pre-cancer survivor. Of course, I may just shorten that to cancer survivor.", "YTA she had cancer. She is a cancer survivor.", "YTA.\n\nEveryone is taking you at face value that she went through a quick removal and it was never thought about again. In reality, it seems a lot more likely you don\u2019t actually have any clue how this impacted her. There are so many additional factors that could have come into play for how she coped with it, how it hurt her mental state, etc, no matter how \u201cbig\u201d or \u201csmall\u201d her cancer was.\n\nSecondly, wild to me that everyone is assuming your friend was making your other friend\u2019s cancer about her? It sounds much more like she was trying to empathize with and reassure him, and you made things contentious for no reason. If you genuinely thought it was inappropriate, you could have had a conversation with her one-on-one later. If this is how you react to things, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if she never confided her real struggles with learning she had cancer with you.", "YTA. My aunt has had skin cancer and had fairly straightforward procedures. She still had cancer. My uncle had prostate cancer and had it removed. He also had cancer. Both are cancer survivors.", "YTA - you have clearly never waited for biopsy results. Any cancer is cancer.  Once you\u2019ve had it you wonder Where else in my body is it hiding?", "YTA. Some cancer survivors are luckier than others,  but that doesn't mean they didn't get the scared feelings. First the uncertainty \"is this something I should see a doctor about\". Then the initial tests and the high stress waiting to hear. Then the news: it's cancer. The doctor says it looks like we caught it  early and then goes on to talk about the treatment. Meanwhile,  you've already Googled it and you know both the 95% and the other 5%. It finally turns out after weeks of waiting and doing, it really was caught early,  the miracles of modern science and all are on your side. Now you just have to follow up with skin checks every 6 months,  hoping that slick spot at the small of your back isn't another lesion. You are a luck survivor,  but dammit,  you are still a survivor who has had those heart pounding moments in the doctors office, those high anxiety weeks waiting to hear, those terrifying Google searches. Maybe you didn't go though chemo, but you have empathy and experiences to offer, including the very needed experience that the word cancer is not a death sentence and sometimes doesn't even require chemo or radiation. Some cancer patients can find hope hearing from a lucky survivor.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m a \u201creal\u201d cancer survivor, by your definition. I survived it and still have to get cancerous cells removed every few months to prevent it from coming back full force. \n\nYour friend is literally by definition a cancer survivor. She had cancer and she lived. That\u2019s so amazing. For too many people, they\u2019re not as lucky. But just because she was lucky, it doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t suffer. Even just getting diagnosed with it is earth-shattering and terrifying. I still get flash backs to that day in the doctor\u2019s office; I remember that so much more vividly than the actual treatment. It\u2019s scary and it\u2019s traumatizing. And she\u2019s allowed to talk about it. \n\nYour friend shouldn\u2019t have tried to tell your other friend that he\u2019ll be fine, but it\u2019s quite clear she was trying to be positive and show him that she empathizes with what he\u2019s going through to some degree. She didn\u2019t go about it the right way from what it sounds like, but there was nothing malicious or wrong with what she said. \n\nIf you hate hearing your friend talk about her experience so much, then I suggest leaving her alone and allowing her to find someone who is a bit more supportive and understanding. Some therapy so you can figure out why this makes you so angry may also be a good choice.", "YTA- Oh mighty cancer gatekeeper, is having my kidney removed with renal cell carcinoma serious enough for me to be considered a cancer survior? I needs to know!", "My mom had skin cancer just a tiny spot above her lip, she died within 6 months of diagnosis from it. She died with a hole in her face it took her eyesight it went into her brain.

There is a high cure rate.\n\nHowever, depending on where it is and how long and how big somebody let it grow before going to a doctor, it can be extremely traumatic and painful with the Moh's surgery. And if somebody doesn't treat basal carcinoma in their lifetime, it can eventually spread and kill you. (My grandfather did this.) Don't discount somebody's experience.\n\nI had Moh's surgery on the tip of my nose for a basal carcinoma. This was caught early. [Beware my nose after Moh's surgery](https://imgur.com/a/fhZtE26) \n\nThe surgery and healing experience was extremely painful. I had a 1.25\" scar sewn up vertical on my nose. It got infected after the surgery. It was extremely pustulous, swelled and split the stitches. It was extremely painful. I had to have both oral antibiotics and topical antibiotics. I had a lot of anxiety about how it was going to look. It's better but it will never be smooth or like it was.\n\nI knew I wasn't going to die and I don't consider myself a cancer survivor. However I will extoll the benefits of wearing sunscreen and a hat. And there is no way I could have avoided this. Its genetic in the family.

Your friend might have been misleading, but you outing her in front of others did absolutely nothing to help your mutual friend and only makes you look petty. If your friend was trying to comfort someone else, what does it really matter if she exaggerated?", "Can you imagine your friend when she went into the doctors to have her lesion checked out and then saying it could be cancer can you imagine the way your friend felt. Then please for one second imagine when they came back with the biopsy results and said it\u2019s turns out it was indeed cancerous can you imagine the thoughts running through her head? Yes her cancer wasn\u2019t life threatening It probably ruined her life for a week or a month. But that week or month probably felt like a lifetime. No she hasn\u2019t had to technically fight cancer yet but she did have cancer and she did survive and she does know exactly what it feels like to go into a doctors office not know what is going on and being told it\u2019s cancer. And for the rest of her life she needs to be extra vigilant to make sure that that cancer has not returned. So yes YTA.", "I\u2019m going against everyone here and say YTA, but please read my whole explanation.\n\nI understand why you disagree with your friend saying that she is a survivor. I truly do. I got a few pre-cancerous dark spots removed and would never call myself a survivor. However, reducing the emotional shock of a cancer diagnosis to the severity of the treatment is a horrible thing to do. People do die from skin cancer, and while it might not be as invasive as other kinds of cancer (depending on the stage it was caught) it is still a shocking diagnosis to get.\n\nHave you thought about what your mutual friend will feel if they get a cancer diagnosis with a very good prognosis and their treatment is only surgery? Do you think they will feel supported by your dismissal of (a) the shock of a diagnosis, regardless of how severe the cancer is and (b) having a treatment that is not as severe as a systemic treatment?\n\nI work at a cancer centre (I\u2019m not a doctor) and the number of people who feel lonely during their diagnosis because they have a good prognosis and feel like they can\u2019t be angry, afraid or sad because \u201cthey are lucky\u201d is very upsetting. The severity of a treatment - doesn\u2019t matter is it\u2019s a small skin lesion - is not connected to the shock of a diagnosis and the emotions that go around it.", "YTA.
