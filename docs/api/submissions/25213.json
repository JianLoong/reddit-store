I would not consider myself a cancer anything.  There is no comparison.", "I'm going to get down voted for this, but NTA.\n\nShe could talk about the scare, the emotions, her journey and how she felt about it all, but to call it a survival... Someone who truly survived cancer would probably raise their eyebrows to this.\n\nCancer is not something desirable or a light topic to talk about, so I really think your friend that has the back pain needs your unconditional love and support, not someone else's story and proclaiming everything is going to be ok (unfortunately not the friend, not you, not even Sarah can know that)", "I\u2019m astounded by all of the Y-T-A here. Like did y\u2019all read the post she had a small singular lesion that was easily removed and by saying that it \u201cdestroyed her life\u201d she\u2019s clearly overstating how bad her cancer was to overshadow someone else\u2019s upcoming surgery.

Getting a stage one diagnosis with an excellent prognosis should not scare you. If you are around medicine and actual disease a lot you will understand the difference of getting one surgery and having stage 3 or 4 and truly not knowing if it'll be cured. Or getting a slow growing cancer that won't kill you, like certain prostate cancers in older men. My mom had radiation for stage one breast cancer and she always had an excellent prognosis and just went about her usual business. She would never call herself a cancer survivor because it was never going to kill her. \n\nIt's like having a cold versus having cystic fibrosis.

You aren't saying she didn't go through cancer. You're saying that her situation isn't comparable to someone who could possibly have some abdominal cancer that could cost them their lives. People get very sensitive when cancer comes up but realistically skin cancer is incredibly common and has a 99% survival rate for localized cancer (I know people die of cancer but in terms of average most people survive). I'm sure she was scared about having cancer but logically, with a small mark on her thigh it was pretty obvious the cancer was caught early on and after her diagnosis the doctors definitely told her that they would remove the cancer and she would fully recover. I totally understand how stressful and scary that situation can be but it's just not comparable to people who go throughout harsh treatment and are hospitalized.", "NTA.

I am not a cancer survivor. My mother and sister died from cancer, one of my friends had her breast removed, my brother had cancer, my friend and my brother are cancer survivors, mine was an inconvenience and only thought about when someone asks about the scar.

NTA for that.\n\nedit: typo", "NTA I had a nickel-sized abnormal lesion removed several years ago and while your sister can probably relate to the worry that someone could experience while waiting for test results, I think that it sounds like a stretch to refer to herself as a cancer survivor in a traditional sense because it implies she\u2019s experienced adverse health and/or chemotherapy. In my experience it was about two weeks between the biopsy and removal, my overall health didn\u2019t feel like it\u2019d decreased, and the hardest part was aftercare for the wound \u2014 vastly less than what I think of when I think of a cancer survivor. If anything, she should give context to avoid seeming disingenuous.", "NTA. My father did this after having precancerous cells removed with a simple ablation. While another family member was going through major surgery and toxic and debilitating treatments for cancer. He would try to bring it back to his nothing bullshit and say \u201cyea, cancer sucks\u201d like he had any fucking idea.  I\u2019ve had worse bikini waxes than what he went through.", "Sooo... I had cancer a few years back. I had a total hysterectomy, but never had to do anything else. However, it was very close to becoming metastasized. It was an outpatient procedure. Am I a cancer survivor or not?\n\nI usually tell people that I didn't have a battle with cancer, it was more of a tiff.", "NTA\n\nMany members of my immediate family have had cancer, some have successfully beaten it while others have not.

I\u2019m happy for her it did not turn into full blown cancer because skin cancer is no joke. But she did not go through major disfiguring surgery or radiation therapy or chemo. She needs to sit down and shut up.\n\nYou rightfully called her out. She does want sympathy and attention and it\u2019s not cool. You won\u2019t be the last person to say something to her. I really hope someone who beat cancer after a long illness puts her in her place one day. Or maybe she should volunteer with a cancer organization so she can be grateful.", "NTA. A cancer survivor is someone who beat the odds by fighting it along with the extensive treatment. It's literally a war for the person and it really takes someone who is extremely strong to survive it. My dad has had skin cancers for his entire life and he would never compare what he has to someone who has gone through chemo or intense surgery. They were nothing more than an inconvenience to him. Obviously, if they go untreated, they can metastasize and turn into full blown cancer.  Your friend is being misguided in her method of trying to make someone feel better about their potential cancer, but she's also doing it for attention to herself.", "NTA, only because of the \u201cIt destroyed her life\u201d comment.

First round burned a hole in my beard and I wound up shaving it off.  Last round came back a little more aggressive and the radiation adjusted my hairline and removed my widows peak.  I gotta confess even the cancer docs were a little confused about the mutation.\n\nI welcome people to the survivors club and leave it at that.

A small pre-cancer skin lesion needing no treatment does not make you a cancer survivor nor would it destroy you life!! Maybe an afternoon while it was being removed. But destroy her life?? No. What a drama queen.", "Info: do you know what type of cancer she had? If it was a basal cell then she is the asshole. If worse than that then you are the assshole. My mom had about 30 basal cells thoughout her life. My father in law died of melanoma. They are two very different experiences.", "I don\u2019t know where to stand here. I\u2019ve had skin cancer and had MOHs surgery to remove it. I currently have incurable brain cancer and have undergone several brain surgeries, chemo and radiation. Yes, one cancer is more serious and has given me a 10 year prognosis, but that doesn\u2019t make my skin cancer experience any less terrifying. I cried, was scared, did not know what the future held. To be diagnosed with cancer regardless of where it is, how serious it is, it is a terrifying, life altering and usually mentally draining experience.

Am I a survivor?", "NTA", "NTA. I found out I had skin cancer on my face two weeks before my wedding, and while it certainly didn\u2019t destroy my life, it did cut my honeymoon short.

She had to have a spot removed and that\u2019s it. please help her get some perspective so she can stop being such an AH.", "NTA.", "NTA.

See is a cancer survivor. Also, depending on what type, it more often than not, reoccur. \n\nNo, she didn\u2019t have months of chemo or radiation but she still had to go through the procedure of having it removed and tested. And trust me, the stress of waiting up to if not more than a week to find out what\u2019s going on is beyond what you apparently understand. \n\nRight now you\u2019re other friend is going through the exact same thing. How can you have compassion for one friend but not the other?", "technically nta but you went outside societal norms. everyone frowns upon her behind her back but you\u2019re not supposed to say it out loud", "YTA. From the moment she was diagnosed to when she was told that it was the local and non-spreading kind would be incredibly stressful.\n\nA friend of mine at to get part of her thyroid removed.  Day surgery not significant.  But until they determined the type of tumour she was an emotional wreck.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to gate keep another persons experience.", "YTA. She had cancer. She survived it. She is a cancer survivor.", "I'm going to go with ESH.\n\nSo the part I think you are discounting is the phase between when you are told you have cancer and the time it takes to assess what your prognosis is.\n\nA friend of mine was diagnosed with Lymphoma in December.  He then went three weeks (due to the holidays) trying to find out what this meant.  You Google Lymphoma and it's suggesting maybe 3-5 years to live. \n\nSo for three weeks he's scrambling to get a will together, to try to go over all the details in his life to make sure if he dies his family will be okay.  He's checking his life insurance, he's making sure everything is spelled out.  It was pretty terrifying.  He's trying to just compress a lifetime of moments into 3 weeks with his kids.  He's hoping he might get closer to a decade just to see his kids graduate HS.\n\nThen the tests come back and he has this obscure form of Lymphoma that's not aggressive and has something like a 10% chance of progressing into a more aggressive form in the next 30 years (he's 50).  It's not anything that needs to be treated.  Basically there's a 90% chance it doesn't shorten his life at all.\n\nSo my point is, you are completely discounting the fear that comes with a diagnosis like this.  If it was 5 minutes from being told she had skin cancer to 'we can just cut it off' probably no big deal, but if it's a few weeks it can be a real scary experience.\n\nIn that sense, she may be able to empathize with your friend more than you are giving her credit.\n\nWith that said, your friend is definitely selling it a bit too hard.  Despite the concern the C word brings, it ended up being super minor.  When that happens you count your blessings and feel for the people who really are facing a death sentence.", "YTA. She had cancer and survived. There are many treatments for cancer, many of which do not involve chemotherapy or radiation. She was saved by her treatment because without it, it would have become life threatening. Gatekeeping is not a good look. Now, if she had been intentionally drawing attention to herself, rather than honestly trying to encourage your friend, it might have been an asshole move, but she is still a cancer survivor.", "Someone recently told me that my cancer \"didn't count\" because I didn't lose all of my hair during chemotherapy.\n\nYTA", "YTA, had cancer, had it removed. Pretty cut & dry. Seems like everyone there agree with the friend too.", "Yta", "ESH\n\nLook, if she was making someone else's diagnosis and experience about her, she's definitely an AH, no doubt.\n\nThat said, I don't think it's up to you to police her language like that. If it upsets you that she might misrepresent herself to people that's something to talk about one on one at a later time. Let her know that lots of people have to go through chemotherapy, radiation and other types of ongoing treatments that have a whole slew of their own side effects, and that's typically what people associate with the term cancer survivor, so she might want to just share the facts of her experience and her emotions and experience without necessarily calling herself a cancer survivor.\n\nIf she pushes back and tells you that you're wrong and that she is going to keep calling herself that then it's not your place to do anything else about it. You don't have to hang out with her, but since she did have cancerous cells removed she is not technically lying and you won't win this battle.\n\nYou also don't really know everything she went through necessarily. Maybe there was more to the story that she never told you.\n\nI wouldn't call myself a Covid survivor because it was so mild, but I did have it. I wouldn't dream of telling someone else with Covid whether they could call themselves that. It's a subjective term.", "I had a colonoscopy and had two pre-cancerous polyps removed. I am a pre-cancer survivor. Of course, I may just shorten that to cancer survivor.", "YTA she had cancer. She is a cancer survivor.", "YTA.\n\nEveryone is taking you at face value that she went through a quick removal and it was never thought about again. In reality, it seems a lot more likely you don\u2019t actually have any clue how this impacted her. There are so many additional factors that could have come into play for how she coped with it, how it hurt her mental state, etc, no matter how \u201cbig\u201d or \u201csmall\u201d her cancer was.\n\nSecondly, wild to me that everyone is assuming your friend was making your other friend\u2019s cancer about her? It sounds much more like she was trying to empathize with and reassure him, and you made things contentious for no reason. If you genuinely thought it was inappropriate, you could have had a conversation with her one-on-one later. If this is how you react to things, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if she never confided her real struggles with learning she had cancer with you.", "YTA. My aunt has had skin cancer and had fairly straightforward procedures. She still had cancer. My uncle had prostate cancer and had it removed. He also had cancer. Both are cancer survivors.", "YTA - you have clearly never waited for biopsy results. Any cancer is cancer.  Once you\u2019ve had it you wonder Where else in my body is it hiding?", "YTA. Some cancer survivors are luckier than others,  but that doesn't mean they didn't get the scared feelings. First the uncertainty \"is this something I should see a doctor about\". Then the initial tests and the high stress waiting to hear. Then the news: it's cancer. The doctor says it looks like we caught it  early and then goes on to talk about the treatment. Meanwhile,  you've already Googled it and you know both the 95% and the other 5%. It finally turns out after weeks of waiting and doing, it really was caught early,  the miracles of modern science and all are on your side. Now you just have to follow up with skin checks every 6 months,  hoping that slick spot at the small of your back isn't another lesion. You are a luck survivor,  but dammit,  you are still a survivor who has had those heart pounding moments in the doctors office, those high anxiety weeks waiting to hear, those terrifying Google searches. Maybe you didn't go though chemo, but you have empathy and experiences to offer, including the very needed experience that the word cancer is not a death sentence and sometimes doesn't even require chemo or radiation. Some cancer patients can find hope hearing from a lucky survivor.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m a \u201creal\u201d cancer survivor, by your definition. I survived it and still have to get cancerous cells removed every few months to prevent it from coming back full force. \n\nYour friend is literally by definition a cancer survivor. She had cancer and she lived. That\u2019s so amazing. For too many people, they\u2019re not as lucky. But just because she was lucky, it doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t suffer. Even just getting diagnosed with it is earth-shattering and terrifying. I still get flash backs to that day in the doctor\u2019s office; I remember that so much more vividly than the actual treatment. It\u2019s scary and it\u2019s traumatizing. And she\u2019s allowed to talk about it. \n\nYour friend shouldn\u2019t have tried to tell your other friend that he\u2019ll be fine, but it\u2019s quite clear she was trying to be positive and show him that she empathizes with what he\u2019s going through to some degree. She didn\u2019t go about it the right way from what it sounds like, but there was nothing malicious or wrong with what she said. \n\nIf you hate hearing your friend talk about her experience so much, then I suggest leaving her alone and allowing her to find someone who is a bit more supportive and understanding. Some therapy so you can figure out why this makes you so angry may also be a good choice.", "YTA- Oh mighty cancer gatekeeper, is having my kidney removed with renal cell carcinoma serious enough for me to be considered a cancer survior?

Don't discount somebody's experience.\n\nI had Moh's surgery on the tip of my nose for a basal carcinoma. This was caught early. [Beware my nose after Moh's surgery](https://imgur.com/a/fhZtE26) \n\nThe surgery and healing experience was extremely painful. I had a 1.25\" scar sewn up vertical on my nose. It got infected after the surgery. It was extremely pustulous, swelled and split the stitches. It was extremely painful. I had to have both oral antibiotics and topical antibiotics. I had a lot of anxiety about how it was going to look. It's better but it will never be smooth or like it was.\n\nI knew I wasn't going to die and I don't consider myself a cancer survivor.

Then please for one second imagine when they came back with the biopsy results and said it\u2019s turns out it was indeed cancerous can you imagine the thoughts running through her head? Yes her cancer wasn\u2019t life threatening It probably ruined her life for a week or a month. But that week or month probably felt like a lifetime. No she hasn\u2019t had to technically fight cancer yet but she did have cancer and she did survive and she does know exactly what it feels like to go into a doctors office not know what is going on and being told it\u2019s cancer. And for the rest of her life she needs to be extra vigilant to make sure that that cancer has not returned. So yes YTA.", "I\u2019m going against everyone here and say YTA, but please read my whole explanation.\n\nI understand why you disagree with your friend saying that she is a survivor. I truly do. I got a few pre-cancerous dark spots removed and would never call myself a survivor. However, reducing the emotional shock of a cancer diagnosis to the severity of the treatment is a horrible thing to do.

I will never be rid of it, it\u2019s in my bone marrow. For now, it is stable & not causing any issues. I haven\u2019t had any chemo or radiation yet as I currently don\u2019t have any symptoms that warrant treating it yet. We are doing \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d where I am monitored & if it begins to transform to something more aggressive or if I developed symptoms that impact my quality of life, we will consider treatment then. It has made me immunocompromised but that is the main effect so far. \n\nMy oldest daughter has multiple myeloma. She was very sick, has had multiple blood transfusions, chemo & a stem cell transplant. She is a cancer survivor. What I have is nothing compared to her. \n\nI would gladly trade places with her if I could.

I don't think either myself or OPs friend have any business telling people cancer has a huge impact on our lives. \n\n\nYour situation sounds significantly more impactful. It involved an actual surgery, and the related medical bills. You were on medication afterwards to manage recurrence. \n\n\nI don't think anyone commenting saying OPs friends day at the dermatologist is equivalent to your experience or that you wouldn't be valid in calling yourself a cancer survivor.", "Breast cancer here.

(the thyroid cancer\u2019s version of chemo) *yes*\n\nAre you dependent on medication in order to live? *yes*\n\nWill you be monitored for the rest of your life to catch a recurrence early? (Because when it comes back it goes to brain, bone or lungs).  *yes*\n\nI\u2019d say you\u2019ve survived it\u2026*so far.*  \n\nI think the experience of watching your doctor look in your eyes and hearing the words \u2018 you have cancer\u2019 is a pretty universal *sobering moment*. \n\nI do not think it means that we need to suddenly get into a competition of ranking who had it worse.  \n\nIt\u2019s a bit like listening to women\u2019s birthing stories.  Generally speaking - everything about it sucks (save for the bebe).  Morning sickness is still hell for 1 month or 8. It\u2019s all just the luck of the draw, really. But you still, were in the draw. \n\nYou\u2019ve been unlucky, yet lucky, just as your Mom has.  Mostly though, really lucky to still be here to discuss it.  \n\nI agree with you, it feels flip to say it, when faced with someone whose experience was far grittier, longer and more intense. That said - it still doesn\u2019t negate your experience or the fact that you also grew cancer inside your body.   \n\nPlease don\u2019t take it lightly - Thyroid Cancer plays the long game, and keeping your TSH suppressed for the remainder of your life, is going to shorten it - and cause some ugly sh*t along the way.  \n\nAlso, I\u2019m really glad your Mum\u2019s ok.

A lot of people treat me like dead (wo)man walking but my oncologist has said I\u2019m not allowed to stop saving for retirement. I\u2019ve got a treatment plan and my CA125 is down to 6 from initial results before surgery of >10,000. So for myself I\u2019m honestly a lot more prosaic, and even when I was in the hospital during my diagnosis my philosophy has been that life is a terminal condition and no one gets out alive. \n\nI just can\u2019t stand people who tell others what they are allowed to feel about their experiences. \n\nI hope you had a successful pregnancy and have been doing well.", "Samesies. I had an excellent medical team who caught and treated it as early as could possibly happen. My treatment after surgery was a month of radiation, which was a lot easier than I expected.

The fact that it never happened actually matters. I'm not going to diminish the experience of people who were on breathing tubes and on death's door. I wasn't traumatised. I didn't have doctors tell me it was 'touch and go'. I didn't get told to ring my friends and family to say my goodbyes. I wasn't gasping for air. I didn't spend weeks in crowded hospitals seeing people with the same condition being wheeled into morgues.\n\nSure, we had the same virus but there is *no* comparison otherwise. Zero. I didn't survive anything, I was never badly affected. I think that matters a lot and I'd feel nothing short of an attention seeking fraud if I said otherwise.\n\nHaving a tumor and waiting for weeks to find out the result is a bit different to having a skin lesion removed, which in Australia, they will do if they even suspect it has the potential to turn cancerous.

Hearing that you have cancer is life altering. No survivors should be in competition to see who has suffered the most, because diagnosis is just the beginning of a lifelong journey dealing with cancer. I\u2019m cancer free, but any time I have a baby thier placentas must be biopsied to make sure no melanoma has spread unknowingly, and I have had hundreds of moles cut from my body in hopes that I continue to catch any issues early.
