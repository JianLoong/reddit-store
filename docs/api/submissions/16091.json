It\u2019s outrageous that they know you can\u2019t be refunded and are asking you to pay them back out of your own pocket", "If you were able to get a refund and get the money back the  you should give it back. But if not, then no, you should not have to give the money back. Its not your fault they backed out.", "NTA. They backed out of a trip that had non-refundable costs due precisely to them saying they wanted to come. That\u2019s a choice they made, not your doing. \n\nAnd they\u2019re also costing you unnecessary extra money! If anything, they should owe you extra for forcing you to pay the upgrade fee, too, when you could have just stayed in the original, gifted option.", "NTA of course.\n\nThis comes up a lot, so it's always a good idea for a planner to include an explicit comment like \"if we do this upgrade, we're nonrefundable after that point\" or whatever.", "NTA. It\u2019s a risk with most hotel bookings that you lose money after a certain period of time if you decide not to go.", "NTA-its non-refundable. They messed up.", "NTA - It is not you who are declining to refund them but the condo rental people.  Tell them to go talk to them.  Not your problem.", "> The problem is that the room upgrade was already paid for, and we are not able to downgrade the room back down and get our money back this short of notice.\n\nThey made a commitment and you should not have to take the financial hit of the extra amount, they should. NTA\n\nThis is like when people back out of going to concerts and expect the friend who bought the ticket be the one to take the loss. Once you commit, the ticket and financial responsibility is yours. Same with this situation.", "INFO: Did something happen between booking and now that would make your friends feel entitled to refunds? Like \u2014 you were going to make them share the kiddy bedroom? Or you sent out a list of rules and strict itinerary? Or you expected them to pay for all the food and drink?\n\nIt\u2019s odd that not only one, but both of them would drop out at the last minute. If you figure out why they dropped out, you might discover the reason they\u2019re risking a friendship by asking for the refund (which, generally is in poor taste).", "Nta. You laid out extra money out of your own pocket already for your share of the upgrade. An expense you would not have incurred had they not been party to the vacation plans. Do they plan on reimbursing YOU for the money you spent unnecessarily? You relied on their commitment now you know they don't honour them. The deposit is nonrefundable\n If you want to keep piece you MIGHt want to see if perhaps other friends may be willing to \"buy them out\" and join you but that's a goodwill gesture you have no responsibility to attempt", "NTA. Weren't THEY the reason you needed to upgrade and pay for a larger condo?  Now that you cannot get a refund or downgrade because THEY changed their minds too late means THEY take the loss. It was generous to offer them accommodations for a week for only $200.", "NTA. I had a trip planned with a bunch of friends and my boyfriend at the time a few years ago. It was \u00a3100 each, and I paid both mine and my boyfriends share. It was all planned and paid for, but 3 weeks before the trip, I broke up with my boyfriend. \n\nHe had a trip planned for a festival the day after the first trip with some of the people from the first trip but threw a fit when I asked if he could not go on the first trip because I paid the whole \u00a3200 anyway even though he was meant to give me his half and he had no plans to give me that money. \n\nI called my friend to let her know i wouldn't be coming just so she knew and I fully expected her to just keep the money because it was paid for but she insisted on sending it back and said she make him send her his half. \n\nI was really lucky, but you can't just expect someone to refund you when it's not their fault you can't come now. You shouldn't be so entitled that you can commit to something and then try and put them out of hundreds of dollars.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they had put money down with a stranger they wouldn\u2019t have gotten it back either.", "The reason we can\u2019t get a refund is because we paid for an upgrade, not the room itself.

I planned a surprise trip for my now-husband when he turned 21, and we had about 4 other couples who committed to go. It was about $100 a person for the Airbnb.

We couldn\u2019t give them a refund and they were completely understanding! We\u2019re still friends with them to this day.", "Then yeah, you shouldn't be expected to pay them back.", "Have you thought about inviting other friends to join you? It\u2019s short notice but $200 is an amazing deal to stay somewhere on vacation. And honestly, I think the upgrade should have been paid solely by the extra guests since you and your sister already had enough space for each of yourselves with a regular condo and it was only because of the guests that the fee increased. To me that means they should pay $400 per room for whomever stays in the extra rooms", "NTA", "I'm still friends with my friends too and I'm actually going on a trip for the same friends birthday in a few weeks.", "op=NTA\n\nthey don't get a refund if you can't get a refund.  Just like non-refundable plane tickets, etc.", "Another redditor had a legit point.  Each of them should have paid $400 for the upgrade(splitting the cost 200x4) rather than OP and sister who got original timeshare for free.

Your friends should think of this as cancelling outside the refund window. Quite normal in the travel industry... They're lucky they're not also out the base costs for the condo, only the upgrade fee.", "NTA... they were not pay6for your trip, you got nothing from them except a giant headache and a guilt trip", "Even if you somehow got refunded and kept the money, it wasn't paying for the trip. It was only paying for an upgrade. Ask them why you should have to pay their \"deposit\" for the room if they cancelled? It's pretty common practice", "They shouldn\u2019t have went on a trip if they aren\u2019t 100% sure about going.
