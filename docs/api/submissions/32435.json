This is a AITA thread, and it turns out you are one in this situation. As for the age, you have a very questionable post on a different sub talking about dating younger woman. It\u2019s scary to think that you posted this one with the mindset of you going back and forth with a 10 year old on who talks and doesn\u2019t talk to each other. NO ONE is making things up but we\u2019re just going off what we\u2019re seeing. And it looks bad on your part.", "This is fair.       I don\u2019t disagree.      I guess just keep saying hi and being ignored every time until she someday decides to come around.       She does say hi, though, but that\u2019s it.   If I asked \u201c how was school today?\u201d She would just walk away.", "Yeah well that's gonna happen, and it won't change unless you stop ignoring her. Leaving the door open is continuing to ask how school was until she chooses to respond in her own time."]}
