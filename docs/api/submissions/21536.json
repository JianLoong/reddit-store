I was charging my laptop (I need it for a meeting very soon) and I sat beside the charging station. I was not actively monitoring my laptop but I was looking at it randomly.\n\nOnce when I checked, I saw my laptop charger pulled out (for who knows how long) and a random woman charging her phone and in a call. I looked at the charger that she removed without my permission and said nothing. She told me something like, I need to charge my phone and continued her call. This to me was kinda understandable. It was definitely rude (these things have etiquette not the least of which is not touching/removing things without permission and she didn't even say sorry) but like whatever. She had a call. I nodded and she did her call.\n\nLater, once her call was done, she removed her phone and charger. I plugged in my laptop, thinking that this thing was over but then she sneers at me and tells me kinda angrily \"I am charging my phone.\" Now I am actually annoyed. She ends the call and what she says wasn't a thank you for letting me charge my phone or sorry for removing your charger or can I please charge my phone here for some more time or even I need to charge my phone. This was her just acting like I was a nuisance. So the next time she left with her phone, leaving her charger behind, I remove it, charging my laptop and sit down.\n\nShe comes back and says \"I was charging my phone,\" This time definitely angrily. I normally would've said something like \"I really need to charge, I'm sorry\" or even offered to let her charge her phone for some time (I have like 35% charging on my laptop and about one hour, I can afford to let her charge for like 10 minutes) but I was done with her shit. I just said sorry, not very apologetically and she starts yelling at me like \"You are so disrespectful, I can't believe you would.... You are so disrespectful.. \" and I replied \"What about when you removed my laptop without permission.\" she says \"I have personal reasons, can't believe so disrespectful...\" and leaves.\n\nI don't think I was too out of line. If she needed a favor, she should have said it in a less entitled way or not yelled at me or sneered at me. I was definitely not the kindest person here but I don't think I was the AH.
