I had a simple plan - I'd make pancakes for dinner. It's usually a hit with everyone, and I thought she'd love it.\r  \n\r  \nAs I was cooking, I couldn't help but notice that her initial excitement seemed to fade into a slightly disappointed expression. She wasn't rude or anything, but I could tell something was off. I asked her if everything was okay, and she said, \"Yeah, it's fine, don't worry about it.\"\r  \nWe finished dinner, and I asked her again if everything was okay. This time, she admitted that she had been hoping for something more elaborate and had expected me to make a fancier meal for her, especially since she had stayed over.\r  \nI was taken aback because I thought I was doing something nice by making pancakes, and it wasn't as if I had planned for a big romantic dinner. I felt a little hurt that she didn't appreciate the effort I put into it. I voiced this, and she got really upset and yelled at me about how I should\u2019ve cooked something \u201cactually worth her while\u201d. She then left and has been ignoring my texts and calls.\r  \n\r  \nI didn't mean for it to turn into a big deal, but now I'm wondering if I should have done something more elaborate or if I'm overreacting.

Regardless, that doesn't justify her reaction.

I threw in eggs, bacon or sausage, toast, fruit cups, and juice or coffee. \n\nI think your beloved pancakes would have best been saved for the morning after when it\u2019s always seen as a slightly over the top gesture. Not for the first dinner you cooked for her. \n\nThe problem is you didn\u2019t set her expectation.

The fact that you put in an earnest effort to cook for her, regardless of how simple the dish, should have been appreciated. Especially for a cozy night in.

That's time, effort, petrol, parking fees etc. I would also cook dinner for him regularly (despite driving over there) and it would always be something healthy and substantial..\n\nIf he served me pancakes for dinner I'd probably be a lil lacking in enthusiasm too. I don't even make pancakes for breakfast, because they aren't healthy and starting the day with refined carbs (yay sugar!) means I'll likely be hungry and cranky a few hours later. Eating pancakes for dinner would probably result in poor quality sleep also. \n\nThe whole \"worth my while\" thing isn't really ok..

When you're 33 you have a better understanding that it's the easiest and cheapest meal possible and just hammers home that the person making the pancakes put in the least amount of effort humanly possible to make dinner.\n\nThe only way you could have fucked it up more would have been ramen or blue box mac and cheese.  Let this be a lesson to OP.\n\nETA:  If you had made \"breakfast for dinner\" it might have been different.  Breakfast for dinner in our house is a full spread.  Pancakes, bacon, hash browns, toast and scrambled eggs.", "I'm 31 and I can't imagine acting like such a brat over a home cooked meal. \n\nIt's one thing to feel a little disappointed, which wouldn't be me but I guess I can understand in a certain context.. but to throw a tantrum, storm off, and ignore all calls and texts? That's ridiculous.\n\nIf this is how she acts, then I think we can all take a guess as to why she can't find a man her age and has to date someone 12 years her junior.\n\nNTA\n\nI also just want to point out that anyone who would serve creamy mushroom filling and a side salad with pancakes is a psychopath imo", "Wrong. she sound like an ingrate. I bet she can't cook for shit and while not necessarily wrong, a thirty something lady dating a 21 year old dude is not a good sign, at least from my anecdotal experience.\n\nI would be flabbergasted to find out this woman cooks. I cooked great food at 21. Dated a 30 year old. Meals and cooking were somehow an issue, but I assure you that wasn't the problem.\n\nI don't think you've had the misfortune of experiencing the type of relationship.", "This is a classic example of someone dating younger because no one her age would put up with her ridiculous, toxic behavior. You seem lovely. You deserve a lot better.", "Pathetic? Yes. Immature? Yes. Are most 30+ year old women more mature than this/more mature than most 21 year old guys? Yes.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t sound particularly smart. It\u2019s clear she wants the evenings that someone her age or 10 years older can/will give her. Instead she\u2019s projecting that on to a 21 year old.", "She's already 33, she should be mature", "I'm thirty and I felt funny hooking up with a 24 year old. OPs age gap is too much", "That's lovely", "I love it", "It really is. I really don\u2019t have a problem with age gaps, but guys (generally) were less mature than the girls. I truly can\u2019t imagine dating a 20 or 21 year old.", "She would have been 29 when you were 18... yikes \ud83d\ude2c", "She\u2019s trying to mold you and discipline you like a dog into the partner she wants. You were a teen, she was an adult. That\u2019s fine for sex and can work otherwise too, I\u2019m not an anti age-gap freak, but she is absolutely trying to train you right now.", "I wonder if you have different expectations of what a year relationship looks like.  It might be the age gap, or your feelings/level of commitment toward each other, but you two seem to be on different pages.", "I have never met another pancake hater!  Hi there! I can handle to some degree if they are wrapped around a sausage but other wise I just can\u2019t. \n\nCrepes on the other hand, I\u2019m down with.", "Could reflect 30s behaving intolerably so she finds someone much younger who she thinks will put up with it.", "Thank you for saying that so I didn\u2019t have to.", "So much this. I LOVE brinner. But it better be the works! I want the pancakes and the eggs, the spinach and mushrooms. Hashbrowns, fried tomatoes, bacon and a side of hollandaise! \n\nIt's not high maintenance to want to feel like you're worthy of a little effort. That's just having standards.", "Hahaha your comment is top comment for me!", "Maybe this 33 year old shouldn't be dating a 21 year old then, someone barely out of teenage years.", "I agree she should be. She isn't. She let her expectations of a gourmet meal ruin an evening.\n\nIt's usually not where you are that makes for a great time, it's who you're with. Not with her would have made for better pancakes and a better time.", "10 years old and you wouldn't be born", "Which is perfectly legal. You seem to see issue with it?", "Hi there. If I was at someone's home I could manage to eat one so long as it was plain with no syrup and I would just say I wasn't very hungry but I'd be choking it down. Everyone has foods they just do not like and pancakes are near the top of my list. And I can't imagine eating them for dinner", "My dude.... why do you think she's not answering his texts?  She learned the error of her ways.", "No it just makes your post make way more sense", "It's perfectly *legal*, but I think it's worth giving her the side eye.", "because it is an issue. no 29yo that isn\u2019t a predator would be interested in someone who *just* hit legal age. (to clarify: she is a predator, and is trying to groom you into the perfect partner) you didn\u2019t suddenly become a different person at 18, if she liked you at 18 she would\u2019ve liked you at 17, and that\u2019s fucking weird for an almost 30yo. i\u2019m *25* and i would never date an 18yo, the maturity level and life experience is way too different.", "Right, she waited until you were juuuuuust legal. Nothing wrong with it. Nothing at all. /s", "If I was at someone\u2019s house I would do the same. We use to have them a lot when I was growing up for dinner. I think that is one of the many reasons why, I just can\u2019t stand them.", "exactly, legal doesn\u2019t always equal moral", "When money is tight, you gotta do what you gotta do to feed your family. I just don't like them.", "To be perfectly honest money wasn\u2019t the issue, just the only thing my mum could cook without burning. Lol\n\nBut yeah just not a fan.", "Oh wow, if that's the case, you are pancaked out! I imagine there are people who have grown up eating a lot of supermarket rotisserie chickens and they feel the same way.", "Way pancaked out.  Now, I want some rotisserie chicken! Lol \ud83d\ude06"]}
