You\u2019re exactly right, if she wants to plan a wedding so badly it needs to be hers. Pulling the stunt of saying you dont love her bc you dont agree with her is super manipulative. Honestly if I was your partner that sounds like the MIL from hell. You need to set you boundaries now or soon shell be picking the name of your kids for you. The decisions for your wedding are between you and your partner, and if your mother wont support those decisions she shouldn\u2019t be there, its not her wedding so her opinion does not matter and if she can\u2019t accept that, you need to make it very clear that you wont tolerate her disrespect and lay down a clear line she can\u2019t cross. She is being the AH in this situation, mothers need to start to understand their kids are their own ppl and treat them as such. You\u2019re obviously a grown adult but she\u2019s acting like a manipulative teenager and shes bringing you and your partner down when this should be an exciting time.

She will have a fit but just ignore it, hang up on it, don't respond to it.  Or just say \"thank you for your advice.  We'll take it under consideration\" and then move on.

If you want her to still be somewhat involved/ helping, let her know that you appreciate she wanting the best (in her opinion) for you (to hopefully open a line of communication and get her to listen without being defensive) but it is Your and your Fiance's wedding and your taste and decision are final.

If she starts down that path, you can leave.  Hang up the phone.  Use the broken record technique.  She has learned that she can wear you down.  The broken record technique works really well.  Repeat the same short phrase over and over.  \"We said no to that place\".  You don't have to explain.  If she keeps bringing it up:  \"We said no to that place.\"\n\nDon't go anywhere that you didn't call and make the appointment yourself.", "If you don't get a handle on things, your kids will be the same way. Nag until they wear you down. It's better if you learn to hold the line now. I like the grey rock technique mentioned."]}
