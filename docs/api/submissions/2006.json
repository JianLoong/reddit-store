Every time.", "Stop telling her any of your plans and present her with nothing but an invite. NTA", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I don't know how you have the patience! Look, I don't care what she might threaten you with, like not going to the wedding but just. CUT. HER. OFF!! For your sake! Put passwords in everything, don't tell her your plans, nothing!! Unless she changes", "NTA  You need to deal with the underlying problem not the symptom ie the wedding planning.  I speak to this statement you made:  \"We have, she doesn't listen and will cry and guilt me and my fianc\u00e9 until we go along with her or look at what she's picked out for us.\"  Relationships with manipulative people are very difficult to navigate.  Especially practiced ones like your mother.  \n\nMy suggestion is therapy for you your fianc\u00e9, because this doesn't end with the wedding.  If not, become a stone.  Shut your body language down.  Don't argue.  Hand her a Kleenex.  Thank her for her efforts.  Don't say anything else.  Don't debate.  Don't justify.  Be a rock her words bounce off of.  Good luck.", "NTA Sometimes being firm and creating a boundary makes the pushy person cry. That is okay, they will get over it eventually and be better in future - hopefully. but you really need to learn to say no and stop allowing someone to walk all over you by using tears and guilt trips.", "NTA but, those aren\u2019t boundaries. Those are polite suggestions.\n\nYou have to have consequences otherwise your boundaries are meaningless. All you\u2019ve taught your mom is that in order for her to get what she wants, she needs to cry and guilt you.", "NTA but it could\u2019ve been said better, considering that your dad and her husband died."]}
