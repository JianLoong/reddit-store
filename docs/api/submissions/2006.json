Honestly if I was your partner that sounds like the MIL from hell. You need to set you boundaries now or soon shell be picking the name of your kids for you. The decisions for your wedding are between you and your partner, and if your mother wont support those decisions she shouldn\u2019t be there, its not her wedding so her opinion does not matter and if she can\u2019t accept that, you need to make it very clear that you wont tolerate her disrespect and lay down a clear line she can\u2019t cross. She is being the AH in this situation, mothers need to start to understand their kids are their own ppl and treat them as such. You\u2019re obviously a grown adult but she\u2019s acting like a manipulative teenager and shes bringing you and your partner down when this should be an exciting time.

It is not mom's wedding.  Her vision for a wedding is not the one that has priority.", "NTA - a lot of parents want to give their kids the best AND living/ getting what they didn't have through their kids, and don't even realize they're crossing the line and clearly not helping. If you want her to still be somewhat involved/ helping, let her know that you appreciate she wanting the best (in her opinion) for you (to hopefully open a line of communication and get her to listen without being defensive) but it is Your and your Fiance's wedding and your taste and decision are final. Draw a clear boundary and let her know she'll be consulted when needed and she could help planning by arranging appointments when you ask her to. If not, just tell her you got this handled", "NTA.

Then you were more than generous to invite her along. She totally overstepped by being opinionated, shutting down your choices, calling vendors and bringing binders with her own ideas.", "Look up the 'grey rock' technique and use it every time she starts in. So far, you have taught her that you will give in if she nags enough. Stop it.", ">until we agree just to get her to stop\n\nYou aren't holding to your boundaries.  If she starts down that path, you can leave.  Hang up the phone.  Use the broken record technique.  She has learned that she can wear you down.  The broken record technique works really well.  Repeat the same short phrase over and over.  \"We said no to that place\".  You don't have to explain.  If she keeps bringing it up:  \"We said no to that place.\"\n\nDon't go anywhere that you didn't call and make the appointment yourself.", "If you don't get a handle on things, your kids will be the same way. Nag until they wear you down. It's better if you learn to hold the line now. I like the grey rock technique mentioned.", "NTA. Moms get real weird about weddings and can easily overstep boundaries. If your mom already has a history of boundary stomping then I'd be prepared for her to take it up a notch or two as she gets focused on your wedding and trying to weasel her way around your \"no\". Call everyone involved with your wedding and set up passwords. I'm talking the planner, the venue, caterer, florist, photographer, bakery, dress shop/tailor, even the place you ordered invitations from. All of them need to know that your mom is meddling and it's not to be allowed and only to go through you or your fiance using a password that she can't guess. Heck try to use FaceTime or zoom for calls instead of voice so they can see you. It may seem like overkill but according to your edit she doesn't listen to boundaries and tries to force you into doing what she wants. Might as well set up precautions just in case she goes too far.", "NTA.  It's time to set some clear boundaries regarding her input on YOUR wedding.   Boot her ass out if she's sucking the joy out of it.", "NTA. You really need to tell your mother that she is ruining your wedding by trying to make it about her.", "NTA\n\nboundaries are not for other people. They are for YOU.

She doesn't get a say.", "NTA your mom sounds exhausting.", "NTA but if you don\u2019t learn how to enforce your boundaries soon it will make life increasingly difficult, esp if kids enter the picture", "NTA. Setting boundaries means following through though. Stop taking your mom with you to stuff/listening to her even if she cries about it.", "NTA. Whenever she starts up again, she needs reminding who's the one getting married. And it isn't her.", "Yes, this. She finds out information afterwards, if not, never. If she asks why it's because of her repeated unrepentant disregard for YOUR boundaries for YOUR wedding that YOU are paying for.\n\nBtw OP - you can't control other people's behavior but you can control your own. If she cries and guilts and throws tantrums- that's her problem. Hang up the phone. Walk away. Tell her \"this is not an appropriate response to not being allowed to control decisions that are not yours to make\" and then just LEAVE. DO NOT reinforce the behavior by eventually giving in.

Cancel any apts she makes even if it\u2019s one you want.  Explain you did not make the appt. My mother would have been like this, but to be honest I picked gown, bridesmaids, flowers.

Enforcing boundaries is hard, but the more you do it, the easier it will get. \n\nI hope you have the wedding of your dreams, and a wonderful married life!", "Ooooh, been there done that (NTA). When we got married, my MiL got increasingly shrill and aggressive when we politely declined her (terrible) advice (like, angry, offended, panicked about what other people would think of *her,* threatening to just ignore us and do what she wanted anyway etc etc). Like your mum, she's also one to sulk, cry, lash out, make wild accusations when she doesn't get own way :/ It took my husband just completely ignoring her for two months before she finally backed down.", "NTA.\n\nBut setting boundaries isn't SAYING \"No\", it's following through on the \"No\". It's ending the conversation or visit when she starts crying and telling her you'll talk later when she's more calm. It's not telling her any details and telling her to leave when she's being disrespectful.", "NTA but stop letting her be so involved!! I can\u2019t imagine what she would say about your/fianc\u00e9s wedding dress or tux!", "NTA\nIt's time to decide if you want your mothers wedding or your own. Stop telling her your ideas, stop telling her about your appointments, ask vendors who contact you out of the blue if they were contacted by her and reject them if they were, stop involving her in everything and allowing her to ruin your wedding. Yes she's excited but it's not your fault she didn't have the wedding of her dreams but it will be your fault if you don't have the wedding of yours. She will be happy on the day with whatever is decided because she will be celebrating you, if she isn't happy on the day then she's just being selfish. Time to really put your foot down here, this day is either about you and your fiance or about your mother, which is it?", "NTA but although you think you\u2019re setting boundaries you\u2019re not enforcing them. If you end up going along with her or looking at her suggestions bc she cries or guilts you she\u2019s never going to learn and round and round you go.", "NTA but as far as the boundary setting\u2026..they\u2019re not boundaries if you\u2019re allowing her to pitch a fit and then do what she wants. I understand it\u2019s hard to set them with parents but you\u2019re an adult now and your mental health comes first. \n\nNext time she pitches a fit, reassert your boundaries and then remove yourself from the situation. Don\u2019t allow her to manipulate you. Give her an inch and she will take a mile.", "Tell your mother that you and your fianc\u00e9e have had some serious discussions and are rethinking the whole wedding. Tell you that you are going into therapy to deal with family dynamics. \n\nThen stop talking to her about wedding planning.  Strict info diet.\n\nYou have to be firm about this as she has already overstepped natural boundaries.", "Correction: There's not a boundary you haven't given in on. There's not a boundary you haven't failed to enforce. There's not a boundary where you haven't taught her that if she pushes hard enough, you'll give her what she wants.\n\nThat's not necessarily your fault right now, because she presumably raised you to feel guilt and obligation when you don't give her what she wants. But if you want to have your own wedding, and your own life after that, it's time to start reading up and unpacking your relationship with your mother.
