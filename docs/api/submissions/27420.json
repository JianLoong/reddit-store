From a very young age she has never wanted to sleep in her own bed, she would come into my husband and I\u2019s room and make some excuse as to why she wanted to sleep with us. Perhaps it was our fault we formed this habit by giving in to her, but anyways. For this reason we avoided letting her have sleepovers at other people\u2019s houses for a long time. However this girl in her class was having a birthday party which involved a sleepover. I knew it wasn\u2019t a good idea, but Vivian insisted on going. I figured she\u2019s a teenager now, she\u2019s capable of taking care of herself. Fine. I told her that she could go, but that she better not pull any of the BS she normally does. She made her choice and would have to stay the whole night with no complaints. So the sleepover comes, we go to bed without hearing anything. I figured it\u2019s going great and was relieved. At 2 AM I woke up to my phone ringing. I look at it and it\u2019s Vivian. She said she ate too much at the sleepover and was feeling sick and wanted me to come pick her up. She said it wasn\u2019t her usual nonsense, that she was actually sick but I didn\u2019t believe her. It\u2019s like the boy who cried wolf. I told her to go back to sleep and just tough it out for a few more hours, that I would pick her up in the morning. So what does she do? Goes into the friend\u2019s parents room and wakes them up. Tells them that she\u2019s sick and her mom is refusing to pick her up, so could they drop her home. Completely embarrassed me as a parent\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Now she\u2019s mad at me for not picking her up and her friend\u2019s parents think I\u2019m some weirdo who doesn\u2019t care about her daughter since they don\u2019t know what Vivian does.

You say you told her not to pull \u201cany of the BS she normally does\u201d but you also said you haven\u2019t allowed her to go to sleepovers in the past so this isn\u2019t her normal bs, this is all new to her. Also, you shouldn\u2019t have wrote off sleepovers in the past and she\u2019d be used to them by now. I used to call my mom to come pick me up in the middle of the night when I\u2019d go to sleepovers when I was 8-10 yrs old. She would without hesitation or making me feel bad about it and I eventually got used to them and stopped calling her. Your daughter never got that chance. And you say she\u2019s a teenager and she can take care of herself, but if that were the case teenagers would be living on their own before they\u2019re 18. She\u2019s still young and should be able to make mistakes with a little more support and less judgement. I\u2019m sure she was embarrassed enough that she felt the need to call her mom when she\u2019s 13 and at a sleepover and to me that\u2019s punishment enough. Do you really want your daughter to be at a sleepover and feel like she can\u2019t can\u2019t call you if she\u2019s feeling uncomfortable in a situation for any reason? Next time she\u2019s in a situation where she feels uncomfortable and wants to go home, she\u2019ll remember she can\u2019t call you and something actually bad could happen.", "YTA for sure. \n\n\"She made her choice and would have to stay the whole night with no complaints.\"\n\nYou know what you taught your daughter with this incident? You taught her that she can't depend on you or trust you to take care of her. She learned that you're not a safe parent for her. She called you because she trusted that you'd bring her home because she wasn't feeling well. It doesn't matter if she lied or not because she tried something new and at 2am felt like it was outside her comfort zone and called her parent. You thought that was a time to teach her a life lesson? You sure did. \n\nYou did this. She told her friend's parents what you said and that's a fact.

Period. You NEVER leave your child in someone else\u2019s home when they become uncomfortable. Ever. All you\u2019ve done is destroy trust and ensure she won\u2019t call you when she needs help. Leaving your child in an environment where they feel uncomfortable is a disgusting thing to do, especially with how many kids are abused/molested by other adults.

If a child wants to come home, sleepover or not, you say yes. You don't know if she's actually sick- that's right. It could be worse.

She did something she doesn't usually do, realized she needed help, and asked for help. That is exactly what to expect from a 13 year old. \n\nYour kid should never question that their parent will come get them if they need them. That's not BS, that's being a child and needing support. Don't be surprised if she never calls you when she needs help next time.", "YTA for making your daughters issue another parents problem. At 13 she shouldn't be in your bed often, if at all.

Be honest, you had an inkling this was going to happen, you just hoped she's be too embarrassed to wake up her friends parents.  \n\nYou need to stop your daughter from sleeping in your bed immediately.

From a very young age she has never wanted to sleep in her own bed, she would come into my husband and I\u2019s room and make some excuse as to why she wanted to sleep with us. Perhaps it was our fault we formed this habit by giving in to her, but anyways. For this reason we avoided letting her have sleepovers at other people\u2019s houses for a long time. However this girl in her class was having a birthday party which involved a sleepover. I knew it wasn\u2019t a good idea, but Vivian insisted on going. I figured she\u2019s a teenager now, she\u2019s capable of taking care of herself. Fine. I told her that she could go, but that she better not pull any of the BS she normally does. She made her choice and would have to stay the whole night with no complaints. So the sleepover comes, we go to bed without hearing anything. I figured it\u2019s going great and was relieved. At 2 AM I woke up to my phone ringing. I look at it and it\u2019s Vivian. She said she ate too much at the sleepover and was feeling sick and wanted me to come pick her up. She said it wasn\u2019t her usual nonsense, that she was actually sick but I didn\u2019t believe her. It\u2019s like the boy who cried wolf. I told her to go back to sleep and just tough it out for a few more hours, that I would pick her up in the morning. So what does she do? Goes into the friend\u2019s parents room and wakes them up. Tells them that she\u2019s sick and her mom is refusing to pick her up, so could they drop her home. Completely embarrassed me as a parent\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Now she\u2019s mad at me for not picking her up and her friend\u2019s parents think I\u2019m some weirdo who doesn\u2019t care about her daughter since they don\u2019t know what Vivian does.

Pity any child with a parent with your attitude.", "13 and 8 aren\u2019t that far off and you are also an asshole.", "If anything OP should have made sure her daughter could sleep by herself for a night BEFORE sending her off. Like make that a condition of going, stay in your room for X nights without waking us up before your allowed to go.", "I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re aware of this, but as a parent it\u2019s OP\u2019s job to teach her daughter how to be a functional human. The only enabling going on is from OP themselves. They should have taken her to the doctor when sleep issues first occurred, they should teach their daughter what is socially acceptable at other peoples houses, they\u2019re supposed to teach their daughter not to eat after feeling full. All of those things are a parents responsibility, and should have happened long before now.\n\nChildren do not come preloaded with life skills; they need to be taught everything, even- no, especially things you see as simple and basic skills. \n\nThis is why it\u2019s important for people to make sure they\u2019re ready before having a child.", " Ah OP an AH.", "Her daughter obviously has a sleep anxiety problem that OP has enabled for years.  She shouldn't have gone to the sleepover to begin with, and she needs a therapist who specializes in sleep disorders in children", "Nah OP an AH", "I have a teenager and I would pick him up from anywhere anytime.", "Nope, two teenagers. I will pick them up EVERY single time.", "Yeah toy don't have kids or you are just an AH like OP.", "It is dramatic and scaring for a lot of kids. Maybe for you, sleep overs aren't scary.   \n\n\nBut when your kid calls you to bring them home for wtv reason at wtv age, you bring them home, and if you aren't willing to do that, do not have kids.", "Yeah OP an Ah and you shouldn't have kids.", "You shouldn\u2019t be allowed to procreate if you think this.", "Op states they avoided sleep overs. So not the usual for her daughter. Op still an AH.", " I believe you posted in the wrong thread..", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

What a privileged, boring life you lead.", "You're an idiot.", "She clearly has some sort of anxiety around sleeping that causes insomnia. \nSo yes, it is kinda embarrassing that she hasn\u2019t been taken to the doctor to treat this issue.", "Not as much as you completely ignored the kid's underlying issues.", "Lmao, nope", "Huh?", "She told her daughter to just go back to sleep and wait it out. I'm aware that toilets and even trash cans exist, but I'm also aware that kids don't always have the best judgment in deciding when it's time to rush to one. And she's already acting like her kid doesn't know how to behave around people.\n\nFor whatever it's worth, spending the night in the bathroom wouldn't have been much better.", "You can't always control throw up.", "For most likely not being sick, but consequences meaning no more sleep overs as she is not mature enough.", "Her friends are children too? They are probably not a group of child psychologists or development specialists. Kids will think what they think.", "I thought she meant if the brother was having his own \"alone\" time, not that he'd rape his sister's friend...", "Um, is that what I said? I don\u2019t think so. yes, going into a bedroom where you are not invited nor expected is something no one should do. How about this? What if the parents were having sex? Is that better? The kid had no business going in there because all she wanted was her own way.", "Yeah OP is an AH.", "HA.  i thought the same thing.", "13 and 8 are lightyears apart. I have a kid at each age and the mental difference is night and day.", "Agree to this completely. Should have been a firm no on the slumber party until she could sleep in her own bed.", "It being dramatic and scary is more applicable to 5 year olds. Their child is a teenager and will have to go outside their comfort zone at some point, this is an extremely low stakes and easy way to do it. By that age in my elementary school we had already been doing multi night class camping trips and overnight trips for sports and band.  If she never has a chance to overcome her issues how will she ever get over them?", "I have 4 all grown. Because you disagree you think my choice to have children should be taken away? Wow so much for listening to different opinions.", "I have four and all are grown and living good lives.", "I did thank you.", "I am so very sorry for your trauma! I hope you had someone you could call! That's absolutely horrifying!", "Well, I was eight soooo...", "Trying to compliment you, dude. It was a brilliant point and brilliantly worded.", "Does she need to instruct the teen where to take a dump too?", "Don\u2019t point towards people and take the chance. This is a teen, not a toddler.", "It\u2019s hard to be mature enough when her mother clearly set her up for failure. She\u2019s never allowed her to attend one before and has shown that she is not a safe space should her child feel distress. Sleepovers can be overwhelming at any age, for a plethora of reasons. It seems unreasonable to meet understandable anxiety with consequences instead of compassion and support.", "She's probably mature enough, but unlike her friends who practiced sleeping away from home at 8 and 9, she's never done it. She needs practice just like kids need practice to do most things.", "For real? My 13 yo went to a sleepover. She was disgusted by the filthy conditions and didn\u2019t want to sleep in dirt. We came up with a polite excuse for her to leave and I picked her up. No kid should face consequences for wanting to come home. That\u2019s just teaching them not to trust you. I always worry about my parenting but after reading some of this BS, I realize I\u2019m doing fine.", "Umm I didn\u2019t mention what the other children would think?", "You sound ridiculous.", "Yes, that's exactly what you implied. Holy overreaching argument batman. If these parents are trusted enough to host a sleepover, going into their bedroom while they're asleep isn't \"unsafe\" and definitely not in the \"never, ever in a million years\" category. I'll give you the fact that it is rude, especially at 2 am, but that is it.", "OP should have figured out why she couldn\u2019t sleep in her own bed the first time it happened.", "Listening to different opinions doesn\u2019t mean agreeing with them??", "No thanks to you if you think like this.", "Thank you!  I honestly didn\u2019t understand.", "I would hope not.", "Not even the same scenario or situation in the least.", "Absolutely right. But because you don't agree, then I shouldn't have children?", "Lol no worries. I really liked your comment. It made me lqtm. (Laugh quietly to myself)", "Doesn\u2019t matter. Your kid calls, you GO.", "I get it!  I can be clever sometimes.", "don;t disagree at all, and I did all the time."]}
