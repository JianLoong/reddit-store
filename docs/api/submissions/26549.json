She has to accept the consequences for her actions. And that means paying for her extra luggage and figuring out how to transport it from Point A to Point B.", "She needs to learn to pack properly. This is one of those deal with the consequences of your own actions or you'll never change moments. NTA.", "NTA \nMy sister is a lots of stuff kind of person, and honestly, I just don\u2019t mind helping to carry all her stuff and accommodate her. Just doesn\u2019t bug me. \nBut you\u2019re not an asshole for not being willing to do this. I don\u2019t think I would claim her bags as mine for a flight!", "NTA. Kudos for standing up for yourself. I hope you did a nice strut walking away.", "NTA. I'm an overpacker. Not like your sister, but I always get to my destination and think \"why the hell did I bring half of this stuff?\" But it's *my responsibility* and my fault. *I'm* the one that has to lug it all around. I'm the one that has to pay excess baggage if it comes up.\n\nJust because you don't have something to check, doesn't mean she can use it.

You're not her luggage nanny.", "I mean, I used to overpack but was never on her level.", "Agree. This is the very reason why you can't take in her luggage. No matter what. NTA", "She knows I pack light and I told her I intended to just head up the moment.", "Are you sure she doesn't have something in her suitcase she's not supposed to have? Because putting it under your name would be a sure way for her to not get in trouble if it gets caught. That's one of the airlines specific rules is that you don't take anything on the plane that you have not packed yourself. So no matter what she wants, she doesn't get it!

I was ready to judge the other way because myself and my husband do not understand the phase \"pack light.\" As someone who carries to much stuff on a trip... Your sister is ridiculous. You were forcing her to deal with her own decisions. I carry way to much stuff I know it. But I have great arm and back muscles now because of it. My bag of holding..um purse could qualify as a bludgeoning tool. The only time I ask anyone else to carry it is when we as a family are unloading groceries from the car.

Susan can carry her own shiiitttttt!", "NTA. She packed it, she can carry it. You packed light so you wouldn't be weighed down. She can do the same.", "NTA, im pretty sure the airport will charge you for the suitcases anyway, maybe she\u2019ll learn not to bring so many suitcases for a short stay", "NTA.\n\nI am a carry on gal too.  I have traveled through Europe for 7 weeks with a carry on.\n\nI am making a small exception for my next trip.  I am traveling with my elderly Mum.  She is an over packer too.  And in this trip we will be in the Middle East and London, so two very different climates.  Mum has 4 different jackets picked out. I am working on rolling it back to one jacket and a sweater.  \n\nShe will be checking her bag and I will be responsible for getting it from place to place.  Luckily my carry on has backpack straps.", "NTA\n. she needs to grow up", "NTA I\u2019m not as bad as your sister but I\u2019m definitely an over packer. I pack for myself like I\u2019m a recently potty trained toddler, and will need back up panties and leggings most days.  Your sister is packing an absurd amount.", "NTA.  She probably didn\u2019t want to pay the excess baggage fees and was hoping to stick you with them.", "Claiming her stuff as your own is illegal, and can get you both kicked off the flight and fined. You didn't pack it, therefore you legally CANNOT claim it without risking serious consequences.

It\u2019s so much easier just to pack and I can buy whatever I need when I arrive if I really need something that bad.", "I travel frequently and Conrad recall the last time I was asked that question.", "Nah, OP is not NTA and her sister should have definitely discussed this plan with her in advance, but they don't care if you point to the person checking in with you who will be on the same plane and say \"She packed them.\"", "You did the right thing!\n\nOn a side note my adult daughter over packs too! When we go on vacation she's always struggling with multiple suitcases and I don't mind helping a little, but there's really no need to pack enough for a month when we're going for 5 days! I understand your frustration!", "This brings back memories. It wasn\u2019t my sister, but I went to Europe with some friends. We were literally going to be walking over cobblestone. We told my friend Amelia to please please pack lights, we were going to travel to multiple cities in a small amount of time, this girl only packs heels, and then she brings literally the most impractical suitcase because it was \u201ccute\u201c but it didn\u2019t even have wheels. So she had like 50lbs suitcase. She was trying to drag after a train that we were late for. \n\nWe ended up shipping back the majority of her stuff at the nearest post office. She literally didn\u2019t even wear the majority of it and we told her we were not going to help her drag her suitcase, all the additional stuff she bought, through the majority of Europe", "I just didn\u2019t think we needed that much stuff, because the weather wasn\u2019t gonna be crazy, we didn\u2019t really need any big bulky clothing. If I\u2019m going skiing, I will bring like a suitcase because winter clothing is so uncomfortable to try to wear on an aeroplane But, we literally we\u2019re going somewhere warm there\u2019s no need for that much stuff", "I always thought of overpacking as the one thing I'm really good at, but I can stay within my baggage allowance even for much long  trips, so OP's sister has me beat."]}
