Sadly my sister (35) died from an unexpected illness 4 months ago. She had my nephew (2M) who she was raising alone since the father dipped as soon as he was born. After her death, our mother (70F) was taking care of my nephew, but due to some health issues she has to go into assisted living, and can't take him.\n\nNow here's where we might be TA. We could take my nephew, we did the math and with our jobs it would work with room to spare. The issue is we don't really want to, as terrible as that sounds. My wife and I both work in very competitive careers, and having to take another kid would push back our retirement to our late 50s. Not to mention our daughter might not be able to get whatever her dream school ends up being when she's older.\n\nMy mother has gone ballistic, shes threatening to disown me if we don't take him, since he'll go into the system if we don't take him. I'm torn, my wife is in the camp that it isn't our responsibility to take care of any kid we didn't make, but I do love my nephew. Now I'm not sure if not taking him is the best option.", "created_utc": 1675140855, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pp30f/aita_for_not_taking_in_my_nephew_after_my_sisters/", "score": 1358, "replies": ["#[Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).\r\n\r\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means. \r\n\r\nThis message is your warning.

Before we felt comfortable with my transplant going forward we made a will. So if neither my husband or myself would be around to raise our daughter where she would go. Immediately I suggested my brother. My husband fully agreed. We sat down with my brother and his wife and let it be known we wanted them to be our daughter\u2019s God parents if we weren\u2019t around to make the decision. They both were amazing in being willing to help my family for the sake of our daughter. \nIm so thankful that no matter how many years it\u2019s been since we were super close, that I know my brother would make sure she knew who me and her daddy are.

How are you going to answer him?  Can you live with your answer, regardless of how his life shakes out as a result?\n\nIf you know the answer to those questions and you're confident in your decision, then make it.\n\nI'm not going to judge you an asshole or not, because I don't think it's pertinent, to be honest.  A kid going into a home they aren't really wanted in isn't a good outcome, and a kid going into foster care is often not a good outcome either.  Maybe he gets adopted by a loving family very quickly, maybe he bounces around for his entirely childhood; I have no idea what the likeliest answer is there.

Some of those families will not have his best interests at heart. Some will probably abuse him. Some will give him the bare minimum. He's a member of your family. A blood relation.
