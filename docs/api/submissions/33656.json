My husband's brother means the world to him, he got his brother's name and birthdate tattooed on his chest, and we go visit his grave about once a month, as well as leave offerings during the day of the dead, we also make sure to talk about him and tell our daughter about him whenever we go. \n\nMy MILs house has some ultrasounds as well as the footprint and birth details, like weight and such, on their wall. We've asked them if they want to come w us when we visit. She always make excuses, which is fine, but she always talk about him like she can't handle the pain of going. I understand that, I know I personally wouldn't be ok for a very long time if I went through the same thing.\n\n Yet, my MIL is always very vocal, as well as the only one going on  about how we shouldn't have any more kids and asks why we would even want another one. Her explanation for us not having more than one is that she only had my husband and she's super happy and wouldn't have wanted any more kids and wouldn't have changed it for anything else, and whenever she says this everyone kinda just stops talking about it, and no one brings it up, which I get, I wouldn't want to bring stuff like that up during conversation, but AITA for thinking that's such a manipulative thing to say/do? \n\nI understand people grieve differently but I think it's kind of an asshole move to act like its such a painful thing to have gone through and then act like her other son doesn't exist/ didn't want him, just to tell us not to have more kids. \n\nSo AITA for thinking she's manipulative, and WIBTA if I called her out on being manipulative next time she brings it up?", "created_utc": 1703369029, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18pg8p4/aita_for_thinkingcalling_my_mil_manipulative_for/", "score": 166, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel like MIL\u2019s grieving is unhealthy b/c she\u2019s essentially forced the grieving onto your husband. Sadly, the baby was only alive for a few days. There was no time for a brotherly relationship to be established. Clearly your husband\u2019s grieving is more about MIL than it is about mourning an actual loss for him personally. The whole situation is weird, frankly. \n\nAlso your MIL contradicts herself by claiming she\u2019d never want any other children except your husband but yet very openly mourns the loss of her baby to this day.

YWBTA to call it out, but only to yourself because she would forever be the victim after that and never let anyone forget it. If you really must, be sneaky about it. Next time more kids comes up, say you'd been mulling around the idea of giving a son the brother's name (either one, as first or middle). It cuts off her being able to launch into her \"I wouldn't have wanted any more kids\" routine. It might still get a reaction, but you can point out how much he meant to your husband and you thought it'd be a beautiful way to honor his memory. Also, that she still has the ultrasounds and footprints up, so you assumed she'd be OK with wanting to honor him and are just so shocked she's not taking it well. Just play complete obliviousness to ever thinking or believing she'd have reacted badly. Honestly, your husband should be handling his mom, but if he won't, there are ways for you to get your point across without blatantly calling her out.", "I\u2019m not sure obviously I don\u2019t know your mil so I can\u2019t be sure her motivations but to me it sounds a bit like she felt a lot of pressure around having kids. She had multiple miscarriages and suffered the death of a newborn, it\u2019s possible she has a lot of old trauma around the conversation of when are you having another. If this was a conversation had frequently while she was trying to have kids she may have started to feel very defensive about the fact that her son was essentially an only child. She might feel like people saying you should have more is like saying she failed for being unable to raise her son alongside a sibling. That or she sees this as other people putting pressure on you the same way she was pressured, and she\u2019s trying to shut that conversation down and make it clear that if your unable to have another child she\u2019s perfectly fine with that. It could be that she\u2019s attempting to be supportive but just going about it poorly.", "[removed]", "NTA.

She hates me for the sole fact I married her son and I don't do things the way she does them, she's very passive aggressive, and disrespects me any chance she gets. She's gone as far as undermining my authority as a parent to the point my husband got into a heated argument w her about respecting my decisions since she has no right to have an opinion on how we raise our daughter, and threatened to go no contact if she didn't apologize to me.

My husband gets it but says it's none of his business what she tells people cause everyone there knows what actually happened, and that ppl grieve different so if his mom wants to lie to herself, thats on her. He's honestly such a saint and a really good partner/dad.", "This was my other comment I mentioned: \nMy husband was actually around 11 or 12 when his brother was born, and remembers being at the hospital, and holding him, and then the funeral and everything. He says he remembers the feeling of being robbed of a brother, and that at the time he started acting out a bit cause he felt it was unfair.\n\nWe've talked about it before and hell admit he was too young to really understand his brother was sick so he lashed out a lot but that even as an adult and now as a dad he can't imagine going through that again. He also became very protective once I got pregnant, to the point he didn't let me drive for a while when we found out I was high risk pregnancy.\n\nI feel like anyone who loses a sibling is bound to feel sad and grieve, especially that young and without professional help/therapy to help him work though it. His dad/ my FIL will sometimes come with us to the grave and they'll sit and drink beer w my husband's brother. \n\nWe also both found out we both used to sit and do scratch off tickets with our granddads when we were kids so we go and get a scratch off to do together like once every couple months, just to keep the memory alive. We're both very sentimental people, and I think that's it.", "This is the way to go. There's no getting around it if it's phrased this way. Not saying she won't try tho.", "I get it. My MIL was manipulative and liked to alter the facts of various events in the past too. It\u2019s super frustrating to be around on a regular basis.", "It\u2019s understandable that your husband was traumatized by losing his infant brother when he was 12, but going to the grave every month is not healthy, especially 14 years later. He needs to deal with his grief with a professional therapist or grief counselor. And if he is taking your toddler, that can start a trauma she might carry for the rest of her life. \n\nWhether or not you have another child, your husband and MIL need to get help because neither one is acting normally. No one ever gets over losing a child, but monthly grave visits and saying you shouldn\u2019t even try to have another should be dealt with. MIL probably made him feel guilty for surviving and he thinks he has to go to the grave but he doesn\u2019t. Help your husband break this cycle of guilt so he can move on with his life and enjoy the family he has now.", "Oh the grave visits were a mutual decision between us, the cemetery is about a 5 minute drive from our house, and we live in the Midwest so the weather is nice 90% of the time and the cemetery has a beautiful garden, it's also connected to a community park that has a playground for kids cause it's like across the street and one block down from an elementary school, so we visit the grave, walk around, and take our daughter to go play for a bit.\n\n I didn't think those details were important when I wrote my post but I can see why the context might change it a bit, my bad."]}
