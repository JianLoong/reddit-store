My husband's brother means the world to him, he got his brother's name and birthdate tattooed on his chest, and we go visit his grave about once a month, as well as leave offerings during the day of the dead, we also make sure to talk about him and tell our daughter about him whenever we go. \n\nMy MILs house has some ultrasounds as well as the footprint and birth details, like weight and such, on their wall. We've asked them if they want to come w us when we visit. She always make excuses, which is fine, but she always talk about him like she can't handle the pain of going. I understand that, I know I personally wouldn't be ok for a very long time if I went through the same thing.\n\n Yet, my MIL is always very vocal, as well as the only one going on  about how we shouldn't have any more kids and asks why we would even want another one. Her explanation for us not having more than one is that she only had my husband and she's super happy and wouldn't have wanted any more kids and wouldn't have changed it for anything else, and whenever she says this everyone kinda just stops talking about it, and no one brings it up, which I get, I wouldn't want to bring stuff like that up during conversation, but AITA for thinking that's such a manipulative thing to say/do? \n\nI understand people grieve differently but I think it's kind of an asshole move to act like its such a painful thing to have gone through and then act like her other son doesn't exist/ didn't want him, just to tell us not to have more kids. \n\nSo AITA for thinking she's manipulative, and WIBTA if I called her out on being manipulative next time she brings it up?", "created_utc": 1703369029, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18pg8p4/aita_for_thinkingcalling_my_mil_manipulative_for/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel like MIL\u2019s grieving is unhealthy b/c she\u2019s essentially forced the grieving onto your husband. Sadly, the baby was only alive for a few days. There was no time for a brotherly relationship to be established. Clearly your husband\u2019s grieving is more about MIL than it is about mourning an actual loss for him personally. The whole situation is weird, frankly. \n\nAlso your MIL contradicts herself by claiming she\u2019d never want any other children except your husband but yet very openly mourns the loss of her baby to this day. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t make sense.", "NTA\n\nSounds more narcissistic than manipulation to me. She's making things that are about her apply to things that shouldn't be about her. This is why I started declining to discuss reproductive decisions with certain family. Ultimately, you don't need a council for a 2-person choice.", "NTA, you don't have to do anything about it though. It must be very annoying, but you could chose to just ignore it, and have your other kid. You don't have to actually acknoledge what she says, just brush it off or keep talking lol", "NTA.  That is manipulative.  The contents of your uterus (or lack there of) is no one\u2019s business.  Have as many kids as you and your husband want.  No one else\u2019s opinion matters.", "NTA for thinking it, but you would be an AH if you called her manipulative because name-calling doesn't help anything. However it would be a good idea to say that you don't want to talk about that subject anymore, and then just stay silent when she brings it up. It's none of her business.", "NTA. \n\nShe is definitely lying to manipulate you and your husband. Obviously she loves all of her children, if she has his little brothers ultrasound on the wall. \n\nYou are very kind, for not wanting to hurt her. I hope that once you have your second she will come around x", "Next time I would just call her out.
