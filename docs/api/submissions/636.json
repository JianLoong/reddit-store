{"id": 636, "submission_id": "yg6txl", "title": "AITA for telling my wife our son\u2019s mental health should be more important to her than her sister\u2019s physical health?", "selftext": "Last month, my son \u201cWill\u201d (17) and my wife\u2019s sister \u201cMichelle\u201d (22) got into a car accident and had to be hospitalized. Will had some painful but not life-threatening injuries (broken ribs, leg, some bruising) but has been deeply traumatized and distressed, and mostly just guilty because he was driving and Michelle was injured far worse. She had major head, spinal and chest injuries, clinically died multiple times and it seemed very unlikely that she would survive for the first two or so weeks after the accident. My wife ever since the accident has been completely focused on Michelle and has barely had any time for Will. When I told her I think Will has PTSD, she spoke to him for an hour and then went back to the hospital and has expected me to handle everything. I don\u2019t mind taking care of the house or our other two kids, but i feel like I\u2019m out of depth with Will and genuinely need her help and support there but she\u2019s always at the hospital. I haven\u2019t told her anything yet but now that Michelle has finally started to recover and talk clearly and walk, I told my wife that I understand what she\u2019s going through, but she needs to spend time helping Will with his mental trauma because it looks like she doesn\u2019t care about it from where I\u2019m standing. She got so upset, she said Michelle (who\u2019s about twenty years younger) is like her first child, but I said Will is actually her first child and needs her more, while Michelle has her own parents to take care of her (plus the title of the post verbatim). She accused me of not sympathizing with her and said she can\u2019t even go one minute without thinking about Michelle and how she won\u2019t be able to live independently for months, if not years, but I said that should be her parent\u2019s problem, while Will should be hers. She started crying and hasn\u2019t said anything else. I\u2019ve been giving her some space ever since, and I\u2019m starting to feel a little guilty.\n\nEdit: just clarifying some details:\n\n- Will wasn\u2019t at fault for the accident, the other driver was. Nobody blames him, not even Michelle. Just himself. \n\n- I didn\u2019t mention it, but I never told my wife to ignore Michelle, I specifically said I know she needs to take care of her but at the same time take Will\u2019s trauma more seriously. Even if he wasn\u2019t injured as badly, due to being her actual son, he needs attention despite the situation. Michelle is obviously important to us, but she has her parents and the entire family (parents, multiple siblings and other relatives) there to help her so my wife doesn\u2019t need to take it upon herself to be her primary support system. She\u2019s also shaken up but in good spirits and optimistic so it\u2019s not like she needs psychological support. \n\n- Lot of comments along the lines of \u201cwhat do you expect her to do.\u201d Since he\u2019s refusing to go to therapy, I need her help so we can make him open up about the accident and then hopefully convince him to go to therapy. My wife has always been better at talking to the kids than me, which is why I need her time and attention.\n\nUpdate: \n\nI agree with all the YTAs about my wording and apologized to her for it, said I don\u2019t need her to choose between Michelle and Will, just to make sure she keeps time for him because I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s understood what he\u2019s been going through these past several weeks. We haven\u2019t fully talked about it but she seems to have taken it to heart and said she\u2019s trying to decide how to approach it with Will because he hates receiving attention and concern when he\u2019s feeling shitty.", "created_utc": 1667008295, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yg6txl/aita_for_telling_my_wife_our_sons_mental_health/", "score": 4082, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes it\u2019s ur child but, In her head he is alive and well. Her sister on the other hand is in a place where it can be her last. I do think she needs to focus on her son. But also why didn\u2019t you just get him a therapist if he has PTSD y\u2019all can\u2019t do much but, support him. He needs actual help from someone who knows what to do. His mom can hold his hand but, that\u2019s just about it. I\u2019m not saying she shouldn\u2019t be there, I\u2019m saying he needs more then just his mother. And you don\u2019t need to wait for her to get him help. \n\nI think this is a difficult situation for all three of them. Your son feels guilty, your wife probably mentally trying to process the fact she was and have almost lost her sister multiple times and your SIL is going through a lot. Dying means ur body shut down and that can cause a lot of damage and issues not just physically but, mentally. She\u2019s gonna need a lot of help and support. Give her sometime and get ur son a therapist. Honestly maybe the wife as well, to be honest.", "YTA. \n\nWhat is your wife able to do that you aren\u2019t? You can\u2019t make Will therapy appointments and get him the medical care that he needs? Your wife has to do this? \n\nAsking your wife to help you manage Will\u2019s issues would be one thing. Telling her that she needs to help Will with his mental trauma\u2026.. she\u2019s his mom, not his therapist. Pick up a phone and get him real help and stop pretending to be helpless and clueless. You\u2019re an adult.", "YTA, why do you think your wife would be able to help Will any better than you? Why can't you take him to see a therapist?", "How horrible for your son, and Michelle, both traumatized in different ways. I agree with the person who said get your son into some type of counseling with someone who specializes in PTSD, it\u2019s no joke, and it\u2019s complicated by feeling guilty which is a horrible emotional burden to bear for anyone.  It\u2019s crucial. As to your sister and Michelle, I can\u2019t imagine how painful it\u2019s been for her loved ones to witness her fighting for her life, and can\u2019t fault your wife for being with her. I\u2019m hearing that you need help supporting your son, understandable, which brings us back to get him professional treatment.", "Info: do you think she blames Will for Michelle being hurt, and this is her either trying to keep him at a distance or punish him for what happened?", "YTA and I can\u2019t honestly tell you what I think of you without breaking the \u201cbe civil\u201d rule.\n\nYour wife\u2019s sister is literally hospitalized, and may take years to recover, and your response is\u2026 to say it\u2019s not her problem and then to also accuse her of not caring about her son? And you seriously don\u2019t understand how that makes you an asshole? AYFKM? \n\nI feel really sorry for your wife.\n\nEdit: it says a lot that you fail to refer to Michelle as your SIL (which she is) and instead refer to her only as your wife\u2019s sister. Clearly she is nothing to you. Do you have some kind of personal problem with Michelle that makes you feel she is unworthy of care?", "Gah-damn some of you redditors are really brutal. \nOP this is my take on it:\n1. You\u2019re handling things at home so that your wife can focus on her sister. \n2. Your son Will is showing signs of PTSD, and despite your encouragement and support, refuses to seek professional help. \n3. You feel you\u2019re wife is underplaying or ignoring Will\u2019s decline. I assume it\u2019s either because she isn\u2019t home enough to realise how serious it\u2019s getting, or she\u2019s wilfully ignoring the issue because she\u2019s more focused on SIL. \n4. You feel that you\u2019ve tried everything you can to help Will with little to no improvement. You think that your wife may be better able to get him to seek help, based on the close relationship and communication they normally have. \n\nOP, your son needs professional help. If your wife is not prepared to check back in to your family then this is something you\u2019re going to have to take the lead on. With how you talk about your son, I can tell you love him and wants what\u2019s best. What\u2019s best is a parent who is engaged, and that\u2019s you. Start looking for a PTSD specialist/counsellor. Schedule a phone call and discuss what\u2019s happening with Will. They will be able to give you some guidance about any concerning signs to look for, and how to broach the subject of counselling in a more successful way. \n\nI don\u2019t think your unreasonable for you to make your wife aware of the condition of your children. But your wife isn\u2019t a magic bullet to fix this situation. Continue to update her about what\u2019s happening and the steps you\u2019re taking. To be clear, you\u2019re not asking her for guidance or permission, you\u2019re letting her know what\u2019s happening and what you\u2019re doing about it. When she has her focus back, then it becomes a discussion about options and what you do together. But for now, you got this. You can do this.\nGood luck.", "YTA. It's terrible to make someone choose between a child and a sibling. You def sound like you're not sympathizing with her. \n\nWhy is Michelle's health only her parents' problem? And why should it be? Maybe your wife is better positioned to take care of her.\n\nYou should've approached it differently, saying you need help with Will, not accusing her of not caring because she's spending time with her sister who is obviously gravely injured.\n\nYTA.", "YTA - Are you not also the parent? Be a grown up and start looking into therapy for your son and take a bit of stress off your wife. You should feel guilty, her sister almost DIED multiple times.", "YTA. I was in a car accident last year and was Michelle and will. Almost died physically had to relearn multiple things including how to walk and had severe ptsd to the point of even looking at cars causing panic attacks. As hard as that was it didn\u2019t compare to not being able to wipe my own ass or feed myself. Find will a therapist. Your wife isn\u2019t one and isn\u2019t equipped to deal with that type of trauma.", "NAH/NTA. If I was will I would assume mom is ignoring me because she is mad that I hurt her sister. Mom has a responsibility to support Will. Will definitely needs professional help too but I see where you are coming from. I don\u2019t think there are any AHs. Your wife it sounds like raised her sister, I can imagine it was scary the thought of losing her and what she will go through. But your wife does has a job to make sure Will feels ok too.", "NAH.\n\nPeople underestimate mental issues because they're not visible. She should give attention also to her son. She can't get out of this situation saying her sister is like her first child since she's 20 years younger than her.\n\nI don't think you should say that Michelle has her own parents to care for her. But, I do agree that a son, going through some big issues, needs both his parents to be along his side. \n\nI've been in a car accident myself M20, a guy came out from behind a wall cycling very fast, and I hit him with the car - luckily I was going 40 km/h so he didn't die - and even if police told me it's not my fault and it's his, I needed both my parents to reassure me I did nothing wrong. And the fact that they were both there, in front of me, just a few moments after, it calmed me. If there was just one of them I would have felt bad, like the one that didn't come was blaming me for something.\n\nSo I do understand the importance of her being there for your son. He must be going through some hard struggles, probably even thinking his own mother is blaming him for what happened to her sister. So tell her to spend more time with him for reassuring him it's not his fault so that he'll stop thinking his mother is putting the blame on him.", "NTA.  WTF is wrong with ask of you.   Yes that's her sister, yes she lives her like a daughter, NO she isn't her real daughter.   Their son is in major crisis.   I don't blame him at all for being worried about him and the fact his wife isn't paying attention to him. \n\nI understand she is concerned about her sister and it was life and death, but if their son is that bad mentally he could ultimately be life and death also because he could do something to himself. \n\nShe should show a little concern for her son and show him that they are there instead of ignoring what's happening in her own home. \n\nAnd where are all the reddit people that always say that the immediate family and the people inside your home are who you need to worry about?  If this was her sister on her complaining that the mom was only concerned for her son and not her in the accident I can just see the Y T A for her.   Or what if the son was posting saying he is having a horrible time, but mom is acting like he doesn't exist and he really needs her.   Then she works be an A H in your eyes.   But since this is the dad posting the son needs her attention to, not just from him, but also her, he is an A H because he can deal with it all himself?   Give me a break.", "NAH \n\nThis is a horrible situation and the only people without blame are the son and SIL.\n\nThe reason I say NAH, is you still have time to communicate better, to make a better path.\n\nBut you have to do it now. You have to communicate a bit better with your wife. She needs to realize that her son needs her too, at least some of the time.", "Sometimes a son just needs a cuddle from his mother. Surely spending a little time easing his guilt isn't the end of the world. 1 day or even evening or afternoon with him them back to helping the sister wouldn't hurt.", "NAH- you\u2019ve all been through something massive traumatic, emotions are fraught and everyone is hurting in one way or another. Sounds like your son needs counselling asap, processing this, especially at his age is impossible without specialist help. Also sounds like your wife could do with some counselling to help her process how she\u2019s feeling too. Her son was driving when the crash happening and while he wasn\u2019t at fault, she probably feels guilt that he hurt her sister. Your wife whose sister being so much younger than her, that she sees as a child, got seriously hurt. She needs help to also process her emotions of nearly losing her sister many times, her son driving the car and importantly (as it sounds like she isn\u2019t processing this at the moment) that her son is also hurting and struggling. When both your son and wife have had this counselling, it may be worth having some family counselling so you can all safely express how you\u2019re feeling too? Possibly with your sister in law who most likely will need individual counselling too when she is stronger too. \n\nNo one is to blame, everyone is processing this event differently and it\u2019s a massive thing that\u2019s happened and to take in. Sounds like you\u2019re doing a great job being there for your son but don\u2019t forget your wife is also hurting and needs you to be there for her too. Do you have a separate support network that you can lean on (your side of family, close friends etc?) as it sounds like you need to decompress being there for your son and in turn wife who can\u2019t be there as much for your son? If not, I would suggest counselling for you too. \n\nThis massive event will take time to get over and that\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s imperative that you all take steps to process your own feelings and the feelings of everyone else involved before it tears you all apart. Don\u2019t feel bad for feeling guilty, that just shows you love your wife and how big of a situation this is. I hope you all manage to come out of the other side stronger and closer together.\n\nEdit- to make it more clear that the son didn\u2019t cause the crash and that he feels bad because he was driving. I am not blaming the kid as he didn\u2019t run the red light! Sorry OP if this caused offence", "Esh I guess? Her sister DIED multiple times. That's heavy heavy shit man. \n\nBut now Will is needing some care too. What about getting him to a counselor for his PTSD?", "info: could she subcontiously blame you're son for the accident and the affects that happened to her sister?", "I'm going to go against the grain here and say NTA. Op is having to completely take care of all chores and 3 kids. 1 of which is extremely traumatized. Taking care of the house and 2 other kids is fair given the circumstances and op never complained. However taking care of their extremely traumatized child is a very difficult thing to do. Op should sign him up for therapy but his son might not want that so even that will be a difficult task. Furthermore everyone else is missing something completely. This already traumatized child has seen that his mother prioritises her sister over him. Hes probably not seeing it as the sister is worse off than him due to his extreme distress. This is gonna cause him to build resentment for his mother who wasn't there for him when he needed the love and emotional support from BOTH his parents. Honestlu all you people saying OP is the singular AH are probably 13 year olds who have no idea.", "Isn't this what marriage is? Sharing support for what comes. Yes, your son needs support and in a perfect world your wife would be able to cut herself in half and grant support to both. Her sister is in more critical physical need atm. Put yourself in her position...just switch patients...what would you do?", "YTA - you should be focusing on your son so she can focus on her sister right now", "NTA. Can't believe all the YTA. Your wife needs to give her son some real, meaningful time and it seems like  she's ignoring him. She can still be there for her sister, but dedicating 100% to her is neglectful of your son.", "I\u2019m gonna go against a bunch & say you are NTA. It\u2019s been a month since the accident, sister is walking & talking now, stated in the story. The hospital & the staff there is there for a reason. To help her, she doesn\u2019t need 24hr big sister care at this point. Yea I feel for her, but she\u2019s not life threatening at this point clearly. Big sis needs to spend more time back at home. & discussing with dad what can be done as a team to help get the son the best therapist & show him support. The son could really resent her for not being there. Yes dad can do stuff alone but he\u2019s asking his wife for help with a very touchy situation with their son & she should slow down & help. He\u2019s not telling her to get back to being a house wife. He\u2019s asking for help with their son\u2019s mental state. I don\u2019t think even if he worded it differently she would\u2019ve handled it any differently than her getting mad.", "INFO: is it possible that Michelle is one of those babies whose sister is actually their mother, and was just raised by the grandparents?", "NAH. I\u2019m sorry for this terrible situation the family is going through.", "ESH\n\nLooks like the dad is doing a lot. He is asking for help. This may be a situation where Will may actually prefer his mom\u2019s attention. Kids sometimes have a preference and it has nothing to do with the other parent being \u201cbad\u201d or anything negative. Will may also be internalizing that his mom does not care about him. Although his injuries were not as bad as Michelle\u2019s, his injuries were significant. He is processing the fact that his mom goes to support her sister every day and from the post it looks like she is not putting nearly as much time with him (her son). Let\u2019s take dad out of the equation. Kids often WANT their moms when they are hurt or have a problem. Mom should check in with him (her son) and really open the door for frequent communication to see what he is internalizing. Teenagers today need more support with processing their feelings and parents should pay close attention to their mental health, particularly when they have experienced something traumatic. Please remember problematic internalizing behaviors are often not seen or picked up on until it\u2019s too late. Read the statistics and research for internalizing issues for teenagers; there is a huge increase in mental health issues and suicide rates as a result of those internalizing issues.", "on the verge of NTA\nUr wording made it worse but i understand what u mean. Ur wife needs to make time for her sister AND her son, from what i understand ur wife has not spent time with ur son who has mental health issues other than the one hr u mentioned and rather has spent ALL the time with her now better recovering sister.\nIn my opinion ur wife should now start spending more time with ur son cuz its more likely he will also be not able to live years of his life independently just like ur wifes  sister.\nI hope u and ur family happiness.", "controversial, but nta. from where i stand, my siblings are like my kids to me, but my actual kids would be even more so. i would try to be more inclusive and caring of my child and sister if this were to happen to me. i think your wife is going through a hard time and doesn't really understand that your son needs mental help almost as much as your sister-in-law needs medical help.", "NTA in my opinion. I get wanting to be there for a sister, but what kind of mother ignores their child\u2019s pain?!", "I wouldn't call anyone an AH here but I agree mom seems to be dismissing her son who needs her too.", "NTA.  Your wife needs to understand that while she feels maternal toward her sister (and tbh it sounds like that\u2019s valid here), she is also a mother to your son.  She should be splitting her time between both Michelle and Will.", "NAH - Sis is in much more stable state physically, but your son should start recovery as well. Hearing that your aunt is your mom's first child and seeing her abandon you after the accident, which you blame yourself for...it'll end terribly if she doesn't give him attention. I wouldn't automatically jump to ptsd, but depression is almost a definite if he doesn't meet a therapist. \n\nThere's only so much you as abdad unrelated to Michelle can do. Your son needs reassurance that his needs are important too, that he's important to his mom and that he is not blamed for the accident by his/Michelle's family. Those are things you can't give him.\n\nI'm going to give your wife a pass, since it's really traumatic for her, but you're also right that Michelle has her own parents to do stuff parents should do. She should be support, not the main caretaker. After everything stabilised you all should have found some routine in all of that too work through it.", "I\u2019m going against the grain of this verdict and saying NAH. It\u2019s a horrible situation for everyone involved. I think the trauma and stress is a lot and causing a bit of dysfunction. I think your choice of words was poor but you raise a valid point. She wasn\u2019t alone in the car. Her son was there and experienced trauma, albeit, a different kind of trauma, same as his aunt did. Your wife was understandably glued to her sister initially considering how critical of condition she was in but since she appears to be out of danger for death at the moment I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s necessary anymore and she needs to give time to your son because his trauma is still present and needs dealt with now so there\u2019s not as much long term damage. PTSD is debilitating in many cases and he needs mental help ASAP to cope with it. Having his mom absent will likely subconsciously send a message that his health isn\u2019t as important which I\u2019m certain you and your wife know isn\u2019t true. Your SIL has other family to act as caretakers but your son has you and your wife. Your wife needs to let other family take care of her sister or at least help in the coming months so she can take time to help you and him with something you\u2019re openly admitting you\u2019re ill equipped to handle alone. I think the coming months will be hard but both of them need medical care with the only difference being the nature of the trauma. Mental health is often downplayed because if you\u2019re mentally healthy it\u2019s easy to dismiss something you can\u2019t see and that someone else has a hard time explaining. Physical trauma is very in your face and not pleasant to look at. I think that time is of the essence here and picking sides won\u2019t help anyone. You need to support your wife and son through this. This means both of you need to work together as a team to help your son while you simultaneously need to support her as well. She\u2019s likely to be a bit traumatized as well. Also her family needs to step up and help your SIL. Your wife can\u2019t do this alone and neither can you. Best of luck", "Info: what was your family like growing up? It\u2019s weird to me that you seem to think a child is ONLY the responsibility of their parents. \n\nThat\u2019s not how family works for most people. I\u2019ve spent time caring for my grandad and mum when ill, and if my brother had died several times in hospital and wasn\u2019t going to be able to live independently I\u2019d be at the hospital the whole time too.\n\nYou also say that it\u2019s her parents\u2019 problem but no mention of if they live nearby or have been about. If your wife sees her sister as a daughter that sounds like maybe her parents weren\u2019t or aren\u2019t that involved? \n\nI\u2019m just wondering if you grew up in a structure where it was just you and your parents? Families are complicated webs and that can be an advantage. Your wife needs to be there for her still dangerously ill sister, and I imagine thought she could lean on her life partner a bit. You say that she helps as much as she can when she\u2019s home - so the intention and that love is there but she is having to split her time a lot because your son isn\u2019t the only one who needs her and he also has you. This is a super hard time for both of you, but you are meant to be a team and I imagine she was hoping you could step up in this area for her.", "YTA simply for how you chose to verbalize things. You basically told her that her sister shouldn't be her problem, even though you admit she spent most of her life looking at her little sister almost like a daughter. I agree with you that she probably should be spending more time with your son, but at the end of the day, this situation likely puts her between a rock and a hard place. Two people that she loves are damaged by this accident, but one has literally been put at the very precipice of life because of it, and I think you need to be more sensitive about that. If I were you, I would sit down and apologize to your wife, and have a proper, sympathetic talk with her.", "NTA You said: \"My wife ever since the accident has been completely focused on Michelle and has barely had any time for Will\". That's petty shocking if true. You said that she herself said \"said she can\u2019t even go one minute without thinking about Michell\". There's the answer. She is so focused on her sister, she's neglecting her son. I am surprised that some people think you are TA for pointing this out although I assume that's because they haven't seen the edit, and your original post implied you were saying that your wife should leave Michelle to her parents. \n\nSome people are asking what your wife would be expected to do. The answer is really obvious and simple: be there for the son.", "What's with all the YTAs??? \n\nAre we just going to ignore that the mother just ignores her own son in favour of someone else who has a broader support system than the son? \n\nOP, in my eyes you're NTA. \n\nIt is only my personal opinion but this woman is no longer a real mother after abandoning her son in such a situation.", "NTA \n\nI just read a post about parents who neglected their child for the sake of their sick child. \n\nOf course her sister needs her  buy HER SON needs her MORE. \n\nIt seems like she is ignoring him entirely. \n\nI feel people on this sub are bashing you, OP, because you're male and they are trying to say your guiltily your wife. \n\nNO! HER SON NEEDS HER! \n\nHe needs to know she loves him, that it was not his fault and she doesn't blame him\n\nHe needs to know his aunt will be ok and it was horrible and nothing he could've done could avoid that. \n\nBoth of you need to understand that this is probably a variation of 'survivors guilt': he was driving, he got hurt  but she literally died and might be invalid. \n\nHe is 17, for chirsts sake! He needs BOTH of his parents. \n\nYour wife is not seeing the clear picture.", "Man, I'm surprised this comment section is so controversial. \n\nMy verdict is NAH. The accident was traumatic for your son and SIL, but also to you and your wife and all other folks who care about your son and SIL. There is no one right way to deal with this situation emotionally. Everyone is probably just doing what they think is best. \n\nBased on your post, I think you may want to consider getting your son professional help to work through his trauma.

We're going to take you to a therapist to help take some weight off.  You don't have to talk about anything serious if you don't want to--you can just vent about school or silly things.  Then that's less weight you're carrying for the heavy stuff.  If you don't like the therapist, we can find a different one, but we're going to try it for six months.

She might feel at blame \"because it was her son\" just like your son feels at blame - never mind that it wasn't your son's fault. And she's overcompensating for this by spending all her time and energy on your SIL.\n\nNow, there's the issue of your son. From the way you state things, he obviously needs professional help to work through his guilt and PTSD. Which he refuses to get. However, your son is an adult - a young adult, but still an adult, and the consequences of his decisions are his to bear. You and your wife are not a surrogate for an actual professional - unless you're professionals yourselves.\n\nHonestly, though, I don't think any of you is an AH here, but you're just humans who have been dealt a bad hand and are struggling to deal with it.

Accusing her of not caring is cruel. But also... I'm not sure I can blame you for thinking that. \n\nI'm a teen with PTSD. When I was at my worst, I needed BOTH parents. They are not interchangeable. And, at a certain point, one parent can't do it all. Plus you have two other kids to take care of as well. She needs to be home supporting everyone more.

I went to a therapist for 3 years and didn't benefit one bit because I didn't want to talk about it. I refused help. In the residental treatment center I went to, kids spend the first 3 months admitting that they needed help. And that was in an environment isolated from their friends and family, surrounded by therapists and other messed up kids. He isn't going to benefit from therapy if he doesn't want it, because therapy is a two-person effort. If one person doesn't participate, not much will happen. It's unreasonable to assume that the therapist will magically know how to make him feel better if Will doesn't want to be there in the first place. \n\nAsk Will if he thinks his mom has abandoned him.

You need to accept that something terrible has happened and that life will be harder for a while, for everyone. It is okay that you are feeling frustrated, it's a difficult situation, but what you are doing now will make the situation worse. \n\nTake a step back and stop trying to control the situation. Be there for your son when he is ready to talk, spend one on one time with him, support him going to see his friends and do his hobbies, make sure he knows that he is loved and isn't an inconvenience for being traumatized.

I'll bet she's also feeling completely out of her depth.   And in a marriage,  when one party has two important crises, the other partner steps up as best they can to manage what he can.  That's your job right now. It's fine to make a specific request of her,  like to try to talk to your son about therapy. But maybe also ask her what she needs from you.   Can you run some errands?  Take up slack at home?  Hire some help with the housework?  Maybe you can urge your son to at least make an informed decision about therapy.  There is surely no harm in talking to a therapist for an hour or two to get to know them - see if they have help to offer.  Or maybe even just to read some bios on a few and see if one resonates with him.  Don't ask for commitment,  just investigate it together.  Go to a therapist yourself.

Your wife's sister is not without a big support team already: doctors and nurses, her own parents, even her other siblings.

Not as much as she could be contributing at home with her own son who badly needs both parents. \n\nSeems to me she needs to reprioritize where her focus is. There are others who can keep her updated on Michelle, she can still visit her sister, but HER son needs some major help and you are only trying to express that you can't do that on your own on top of being responsible for the rest of the household including other children. \n\nI'm not discounting that Michelle died a few times, and that is certainly scary and probably traumatizing for the wife, but it's going to be even more traumatizing if her son unalives himself due to trauma and PTSD and possibly thinking his mom blames him for the sister. And that's a really easy conclusion for someone in that mental state to come to. It's going to be really easy for him to see his mother's choice to be at the hospital all day as her choosing her sister over him and thus blaming him for what happened. Mom is not considering how her actions are affecting her son at all (and neither are many of the other commenters, IMO).\n\nShe is neglecting the very real trauma of her son.

I mean I get the mother is rightfully  concerned. She is being a good sibling but she can't just drop her life and dump it on him and him not be at his limit. It's unfair to op and it's a bad situation.  The mom is kinda the AH. Doesn't really talk to her son who is having survivors guilt and ptsd. Doesn't talk to op about how she is handling it and just left the house. If I was the son I'd feel guilty if my mom did this. I don't get the hate for him admitting he is out of his depth and is having a hard time doing everything by himself. He isn't looking for someone to offload on.

Everyone asking why you can't pick up the mantle apparently haven't bothered to actually read your post. He's 17 and dealing with being the driver of a terrible accident which nearly cost his aunt's life. He needs both parents.\n\nThat being said, your wife is going through a lot. She almost lost two kids. I know her sister isn't her daughter, but you can't help that feeling of \"this is my child\". When it's there, it's there. She's also seen Michelle in a truly awful state, one which she was literally dead several times over. It must have been so traumatic to your wife to see this and being able to see Michelle getting better must be so reassuring, even though it's naturally taking such a long time. The thing about mental health is, it presents so much differently than physical health. Will's physical injuries weren't as severe as Michelle's and, I'm sorry to say, but his mental scarring is likely on a very similar level to hers. He did go through something traumatic, but so did Michelle. She died several times over, woke up to a body she wouldn't have recognised as her own, couldn't even speak and likely thought that she would be like it for the rest of her life. That is terrifying for anyone to go through. In situations like that, you urgently need your support network and your big sister who you may view as a second mum definitely comes under the category of people you need. Your wife likely sees this every time she visits Michelle. She's not being intentionally cruel to Will, she's focusing on the person she views as needing her more. She's also, in all likelihood, feeling completely overwhelmed by it all. Like I said, she almost lost two of the most precious people in her life.\n\nI presume this has been happening over the course of months. Months in which Will's mental health issues have been on your shoulders alone, not to mention taking care of your second kid and household duties. Then there's your feelings on almost losing your son. It's natural to need support in this, whether you're the mother or the father, which people tend to overlook. \nAs Michelle is still currently in hospital and your wife is very reluctant to be away from her too long, I wonder if at least the three of you (I'm not sure of your other child in terms of age), might go to see Michelle together. If your son is seeing a therapist, ask them if this might be acceptable for Will, just to make sure it wouldn't risk setting him back. Seeing her could help Will in terms of seeing that she is healing and may help him heal too. It could also be a boost to Michelle, but you should talk it through with your wife and her parents before, just to be sure it wouldn't take her back if the last time she saw him was in the car.\n\nLastly, apologise to your wife for upsetting her. I know you didn't mean to, but it still happened. Make it clear that you love her and want to help her, but you also need support.

One of these people in the accident clearly needs more support and it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for your wife to spend a lot more time with her sister that needs a lot more help.

You care more for you son that your wife's sister, which is understandable because he's your child and we ALL want whats best for child and we hope our SO wants the same. It seems your wife has forgotten that she has a son that still needs his mom, even if he has his dad. And that's also understandable because her sister is seriously injured. \nMan, just let Michelle get better, and wait for the dust to settle.

It\u2019s okay to feel out of your depth; this is a very difficult situation that I don\u2019t think many people would be able to handle. All of your feelings here are valid, but I think you need to apologize to her for saying one is more important than the other because BOTH are important to her.

They both need your support, not just him.\n\nedit: I also want to add, since it is even more reason to get your wife into therapy, that because your son was driving, some part of your wife likely holds him responsible for what happened to her sister.

Will you be helping her sister??\n\n\"My wife has always been better at talking to the kids than me\". Have you failed to foster a close relationship with your child, and now you and your son are paying the price?", "YTA as someone who had to raise a sibling from when they were small, there's a strong bond there that's similar to being a parent. If my little brother was in that bad of condition and I knew my own kid was relatively okay and going to be okay, I would want to spend every moment I could with my brother. \n\nYou have NO CLUE what could happen to her sister, a good friend went through a horrible accident years back and they thought everything would be fine until suddenly something within her spine collapsed and she was paralyzed from the waist down.", "Yta. Give your wife a damn break and be independent. What can she do that you can\u2019t do? You can\u2019t pick up a phone and make an appointment, or be there for your son?\n\nHer sister almost died multiple times so understandably she\u2019s trying to be there for her as she\u2019s in shock, if your son is so distressed and mentally fragile right now, neither of you should be dealing with it by yourselves, get professional help, there\u2019s free online helplines that you can call if he just wants to talk and not commit to therapy full time right now.\n\nBe an adult and be independent dude", "Alright, I had to come back because I was trying to sleep but couldn't because I had some more thoughts.\n\nYes, OP YTA. But here are some steps to NOT be TA:\n\nStep 1: Your son has been through a lot. He's feeling a lot of things that you probably can't relate to so you're feeling lost. And if he's like the average teenage boy in Western society, he may not even have the emotional language to discuss how he's feeling or even to know what exactly it is he's feeling. So first thing I urge you to remember is that it's been a month. A MONTH. A smooth 30 days! That's literally no time at all. You do not have to rush him to recovery. There is no timeline to healing. Let him process what he's going through. If he isn't exhibiting signs of being a danger to himself or to others, give him some space. Be attentive and supportive; check-in with him once a week or so to see if he wants to talk. If he does, actively listen without trying to solve the problem. Let him know that you are there for him. If he doesn't want to talk, let him be. Since he's not ready for therapy, you might want to get him a journal to write his thoughts and feelings down. It's good for him to have a place to get his feelings out and not have them bottled up inside. It's not therapy, but it is THERAPEUTIC! Be patient and give him some time to decide how he wants to get through this period. Because it's going to suck! Don't try to \"get him back to normal\" because there is no normal. He has to find a new normal, so just be there for him.\n\nStep 2. Give your wife some goddamn grace. She's going through a lot too and the last thing she needs is for you to be guilt-tripping her about not doing enough for her son. You guys are married. That means there's going to be times where one of you is going to have to do more heavy lifting in one area of your life while the other focuses on something else...here that something else is your SIL's recovery. You're a team, so be a good teammate!\n\nStep 3. Be more sympathetic to what Michelle is going through. It's only been 30 days for her too. Physically AND MENTALLY, she's going through a lot and she needs her village. Your wife/her sister is a part of that village. It is not solely the responsibility of her parents to care for her, esp since you already acknowledge that your wife sees her like her own daughter, she (Michelle) needs all the support she can get right now because she is going to be living with the effects of this accident for a very long time. I mean, the woman DIED for christ's sake. Show some compassion.\n\nGood luck to you and your family. Sending good vibes to your son, wife, and SIL!", "Meh. Be better. Step up.

OP said son was driving, but was it his fault? I'm asking because it could play into wife's mentality. If the baby sister that she seemingly thinks of as a daughter (as OP says) nearly died and it was literally her son's fault, that could be playing a factor.\n\nI'm not saying he deserves to be ignored by his mom. I'm just wondering if she isn't, in addition to reeling from her baby sister nearly dying and now having potentially life long medical issues, maybe also taking some space to get her shit straight so she doesn't pile on a son that already feels guilty.", "I mean, this sounds like mom isn\u2019t there for Will *at all* because she is singularly focused on her sister which is going to be tremendously damaging to a teenager with PTSD. \n\nMom isn\u2019t an asshole, but she is inadvertently hurting her kid. Shitty situation with no good answers.", "It doesn't sound like mom has been around enough to know if her son is okay or not.  Sister is alive and well now, so mom needs to focus some of her time on son.", "THIS RIGHT HERE.  OP needs to step up and handle this, take leadership and responsibility for getting son better and not depend on his wife to do this. He's more than capable, he just needs to realize this.

Support from your loved ones is also an important part of healing in a lot of situations.\n\nAnd for OP's wife to find just a couple of hours for her son over the course of a month says a lot. Like... She can't find one day in five for him?\n\nOP is an AH for how he phrased it, but OP's wife needs to find ways to help both people who need her. The idea that her support wouldn't make an impact is severely under stating the importance of a mother/son relationship.", "His wife can make sure her son doesn't think she blames him, for one. If her focus is on Michelle as completely as OP says and their son is already blaming himself and feeling guilty, then he may take the mother's absence/lack of attention as a sign of her blaming him too.\n\nGuilt has a bad tendency to make you look at damn near everything as reason to continue mentally self-flagellating, even if it's not true. Even if he goes into therapy, a therapist is going to have a hard time getting through to him if he's interpreting his mother's actions as validating his fault (even though OP said it wasn't).", "I'm divorced and the primary caregiver of my daughter, but in some instances she needs her mother and there is NOTHING I can do until she gets that support or her mother agrees with me. Therapy does zero good unless the kid wants to go.", "This is absolutely unhinged. He\u2019s a minor and she\u2019s his mother. He needs both parents.

If OP isn\u2019t helping now (you have no reason to believe this), let\u2019s say he does - then the other two kids need their mom. She\u2019s being incredibly selfish. NTA.", "How on earth is this the top comment? You think it's ok for a parent to completely neglect their child who has been through trauma? And that it's ok because the other parent is around to pick up the slack?\n\nThis isn't a jobshare where as long as the hours are covered everything's ok. The kid needs both of his parents. She is doing real emotional damage to her kid by not being around at this time. Kid already blames himself and now mom has checked out and won't spend time with him in favor of putting all her energy into worrying about her sister. Mom is reinforcing will's self blame.", "And then in a couple of years we'll have the mother posting on here asking how to fix her relationship with her son because she basically abandoned him during his time of need but its \"not her fault because her sister needed her support more\".", "I'll be in the minority but I somewhat disagree. Sure, there might not be much his wife can DO and OP could've approached it better, but sometimes it's not about what a parent can do/say, just about the presence they bring. There have been times where I just needed a hug from my dad, times where I just neeeded a hug from my mom,  and times I needed a hug from both. I agree that Will needs therapy to actually work through this, but it's not entirely fair to say he doesn't need his moms presence, even if it's not all the time.", "His remorse is likely being compounded by the fact that his mom is spending all her time looking after the sister and none with him. It sounds like shes completely avoiding him, save for when her husband actually forces her to spend time with him, and he is probably reading that as her blaming him for the injury to some degree. He is scared and guilty and in pain, and his mom isn't there for him. So to answer your question, practically there isn't much he can't do that she can. Emotionally, supportively? He can't be the mother and the father, there is no subsitute for one parent being there for the child and the other choosing to be absent to tend to someone else. She is in a difficult spot, but ultimately when forced to choose between looking after her hurt son or her hurt sister, she rushes to the sister, and even after her immediate support isn't needed, continues to avoid the son. That is going to be hurtful to the kid.", ">What is your wife able to do that you aren\u2019t? \n\nParasitic take of the day.\n\nI'm sorry, but if the wife - the mother of OP's son - is never home and not able to support their own son that desperately needs it, OP can't do anything else than support him.

However, it sounds like he\u2019s struggling to deal with the sons PTSD on top of the other two kids and the house and life. I feel like after a month it\u2019s fair for him to ask for her to come back to her responsibilities, he just didn\u2019t handle it properly?", "I dont think thats the case here... As a parent(no matter wich gender) you often have with some of your kids a better bound than with others, because you share interests or have simila Charakteristika. So for this situation, the son and mother probably have the better bound and she can help him better to open up and speak. Especially after what happend. If the gender were reversed and the wife is struggeling to get the son to open up and asks the father to step up, would you still be saying this?", "No i absolutely disagree with you. Will needs his mother to talk to him and care about him, which she is not doing rn. Her only priority is her sister. She didnt even try to have time with her SON, only when her husband told her to. She is TA and the husband has the right to ask for help from his wife, the kids MOTHER. Its like she is neglecting her family and it affects everyone, especially Will. Will probably feels shittier because his mother is neglecting him entirely.", "How would you feel if one parent seemed to be ignoring you and your trauma? I know I would feel resentment and it would only get worse. It's not about needing a women specifically, it's about needing both patents. If it was the mom on here, I would bet that everyone would be calling her husband and a hole, and saying that they should get divorced", "I cannot agree more.", "THIS RIGHT HERE. PTSD is not something that dad can assist with healing. Son definitely needs taken to a mental health professional. So taking care of the children should be OPs job right now, while wife assists her sis. Based on her recovery, it won't be forever and dad and kids can make it through this. So I'll have to lean toward YTA.", "What can his wife do that he isn't? Uh she can literally be his other parent and be there for him so that BOTH of his parents are showing love and support for their child? Like duh??", "Exactly she's his mum.

That\u2019s a myth men use to get out of doing things for their kids.", "I don\u2019t get this take. It\u2019s not about her being better at handling it, it\u2019s about a kid needing both of his parents. Like this seems really obvious to me. If I was the son I would want the comfort of both of my parents, not just one of them.", "No but both parents should be there, not just one. Thays the point. She is also wills parents. He needs both", "Because you need someone to want therapy for it to work? What kind of sociopathic response is this? A kid gets in an accident, his aunt is badly injured and his mother avoids him for a month. Have you considered that the kid might feel that his mom blames him for the accident? How is a therapist going to help that? Her sister can walk now, so it does seem like she's safe enough to deal with your child's PTSD that you've likely been aggravating.", "It's crazy because the sister is legitimately in a life threatening situation and has already technically died multiple times according to OP. It just seems more reasonable that the wife be at the hospital with her sister knowing that her son is physically fine? The emotional damage from everything that has transpired can be worked on with therapy, but if the sister dies, everything just ends there.", "I totally agree and his edit makes it even worse!! It\u2019s big \u201cI never spend time with my kids\u201d energy. This guy is a total AH. His wife\u2019s sister, who is truly more like a daughter given the age difference, is critically injured. Now, he thinks he deserves a cookie for looking after the house and kids for a month. That is the minimum you should be doing! Step Up!! I understand your son is struggling but he isn\u2019t dying. It\u2019s basic conservation of resources on your wife\u2019s part. To say Michelle doesn\u2019t need psychological support after you describe her injuries is\u2026ignorant at best. It doesn\u2019t appear empathy is your strongest suit but I still think YOU need to talk to your son and get him to therapy and not pass the buck to your wife.

The other party ran a red light and t boned the card. Please stop blaming the poor kid.", "I can\u2019t believe I had to scroll down so far to find this. There really isn\u2019t an asshole here. It\u2019s just a shitty situation for everyone involved and it sounds like dad is trying his best to mediate any collateral damage", "The fact that this is a possibility is exactly why her son needs her involvement in addition to his father's in his healing. The son already blames himself, it would be natural for him believe his mother blames him as well since she is so close to her sister. If mom doesn't proactively reassure son of her love and forgiveness his mental trauma will be so much worse than it already is. What if sister is permanently disabled? Son could go the rest of his life believing he ruined her life and that his own mother hates him for it. Rejection by a mother is one of the most painful attachment wounds for men and can be debilitating.\n\nNAH, it is understandable mom wants to be with sister, but dad is not wrong in recognizing the potential harm to son from the current imbalance in mom's attention. I sincerely hope you guys can find a way to be there for each other in this time and that mom is able prioritize her son's needs while still showing her love for sister. I do have to agree with dad here though, if it is not possible to do both son needs to come first.", "THANK YOU. These comments are acting like OP wants her home to do the washing and childcare when all he\u2019s looking for is his wife\u2019s support with their child who is suffering. Sister has an entire family and medical team, the son gets just dad, and maybe mom when she has time to leave the hospital? She\u2019s not being a good mother at all. I don\u2019t understand these comments, but I can almost guarantee they think op wants her home for womanly duties or because he can\u2019t \u201chandle\u201d it in a sad man sort of way. Or worse, they think a 17yo male shouldn\u2019t need his mother. I\u2019m really saddened by this comment section. I hope OP realizes he asked a bunch of children who think they are adults but don\u2019t actually understand", "Shocked at the amount of YTA comments. If the tables were turned people would be screaming NTA lol.", "The son deserves the attention of both his parents, but one is actively choosing to avoid him. The sister is in a hospital, unless she is a surgeon being there accomplishes nothing but coordinating consent if she's the power of attorney and quelling her own fears somewhat (being there helps the family, the unconcious patient less so, speaking as someone who has been in both positions). Right now, the kid is blaming himself. He is likely interpretating his mother's avoidance with blame. The more he pictures her there at the sister's bedside, worrying about her, the more he feels he has to blame himself for. He's not just hurt the sister, you see, he's responsible for putting his mom through this entire ordeal. And the only way to work through that is going to be communicating between the two, having both parent's present to support him and dismiss all the blame he thinks he deserves.", "Holy crap, same, Im appalled at all people saying OP is TA here\n\nLike, wtf, wife is putting the ENTIRE responsibility of managing her SON'S health on OP and is completely neglecting her OWN CHILD.  \n\nSister is going to make it.  Wife has a son at home who is not dealing with all of this well, at least in part because he only has ONE person there helping him through this.

Everyone is acting like he wants her home to do the fucking laundry when all he wants is his spouse and mother of their child\u2019s support in making sure their kid is okay. She might be a good sister, but she is not being a good mom *at all*. It sounds like she spends more time at the hospital than with her traumatized son (op says she talked to him for an hour). Her sister has an entire family, but it doesn\u2019t sound like the son had anyone but his dad. *Obviously* the sister is injured much worse, but she has her entire family with her and a whole team of doctors to make sure she is okay. Son gets\u2026dad. Poor kid", "thank u I was seeing all the YTA and im confused on how a mother can say this child is like my first born when you actually have a first born. Would she say that infront of her son im sure as hell sure she wouldn't. Michelle has her own parents to take care of her its bin months and since she's spending so much time at the hospital the son is constantly reminded about what he did and he probably feels his mom is avoiding him due to the crash. No wounder why he's struggle. When he's older and the mom reaches out she's gonna act all suprised when he puts a brick wall up", "Thank you. \n\nWtf is wrong with the comments here. \n\nWill is her son and he needs his mother desperately right now. People seem to think OP is bailing because it\u2019s \u2018hard\u2019 and he wants his wife to somehow come and magic things better for Will. That isn\u2019t what he\u2019s asking for, at all and it\u2019s insulting that people are suggesting that. He\u2019s asking his wife, the mother of his son, to be a parent. Parenting is 50/50, not \u201cfuck off and leave it all to dad when my child is going through serious mental trauma\u201d. The loops people are jumping to. Suggesting dad is trying to hand it all off to the mother when the reality is actually the opposite - the mother is leaving it all to dad and giving no fucks about supporting her child through serious trauma. \n\nMum is neglecting Will and probably her other two children as well. I get it\u2019s difficult for her and she loves her sister, but her duty to her child, especially one who absolutely needs the comfort and support of his mother while dealing with his guilt, is more important. \n\nThis is what you sign up for when you become a parent. You agree to put your children first, even under very trying and difficult circumstances, because you chose to give them life. It\u2019s her job as a parent to support her husband to look after their child. \n\nI fear Will might internalise his mother\u2019s absence. He already blames himself, if she\u2019s not around while he\u2019s processing the accident, he\u2019s going to end up feeling, rightly or wrongly, like his mother blames him and once that\u2019s established in his mind, it\u2019ll be extremely difficult to shift. I know OP said his wife doesn\u2019t blame him but I fear Will won\u2019t see that. This is a crucial time for Will and if his mother fails to support him, I suspect the damage to their relationship will be irreparable.", "Finally a reasonable comment. \n\nIdk why the majority opinion seems to be that OP thinks it's only his wife's job to care about his son, clearly he just thinks the kid needs both parents and wants her help in trying to get the kid to therapy.

PTSD is not something you can just talk your way out of with family, it's a condition that literally changes your way of thinking. Treating PTSD requires professional help, like a psychiatrist, not your mom. When you experience something that traumatic your brain will change, and you will use coping mechanisms to stay alive.

This process takes time and cant be rushed. \n\nMy advice for OP would be to have a heart to heart. You can see that he has a hard time, you love him and want what is best for him. He can come to you and rely on you if he needs that. Acknowledge his feelings, and let him decide on what to do with them. Tell him that you are ready to help when he is ready to accept help. And lastly tell him you can help him find a therapist if and when he wants it. And let him know he is loved, and that he can rely on everyone around him.

It is completely irrelevant how well OP is supporting their son, his mother needs to step up too and be physically there for him at least part of the time. \n\nEven if she isn't thinking her son is to blame, her son might well be thinking that she does on some level blame him (adding to likely survivors guilt).

Third -your accident was undeniably caused by someone else, there was nothing either of you could have done to prevent it therefor no guilt. And finally- neither of you were a child at the time, you were both adults better able to process your emotions. Not saying the wife shouldn't support her sister, of course she should.

That would be false.  A minor doesn't get to choose to go to a medical professional BTW, they are a minor and the parents can take them and make sure they get care.  Is it a fight?
