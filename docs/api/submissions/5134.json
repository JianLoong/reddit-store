I grew up in \"the hood\" so I am pretty resilient. I'm not going to get into my past much but I don't want to portray myself as some super tough guy. I just have been through so much that small things do not bother me. And by \"small\" I mean literally anything that isn't life threatening. I could come home from work to everything I own being burned and destroyed and I'd be fine. I'd be annoyed by it, but I'm alive. It's not the \"it could always be worse\" mentality. It HAS been worse. Little shit does nothing to me. Annoying traffic, people talking about me at work, rude people etc. I worked retail from 18 to 23 and I was great at it because customers snapping at me does nothing. Spew all the vile things at me, I don't care. And I've learned that it only bothers people MORE that you don't care.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI met my gf through her brother/my friend. She liked me and her bro set us up. Now her family is pretty old school. My gf and friend are cool but her family is kind of problematic. Not in a big way but in that way that a lot of older white people can be. Her grandfather on the other hand is very openly racist. I agreed to have Thanksgiving dinner at their house. He wasn't even supposed to be able to make it but in the last minute he came and it got racist real fucking quick.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not going to get into specifics but he started out somewhat racist and got more racist when he saw it did nothing for me. He would say something and I would just respond calmly and compliment him. For example, he made a racist joke about black people and cars and I complimented his car and then said the food was delicious. I didn't raise my voice or even get bothered at all. I wasn't doing it to prove a point, this is how I would basically handle an annoying retail customer. I just don't care. He got increasingly more annoyed that I wasn't hurt by his comments and felt threatened by it. I was just talking normal and he was yelling at one point. I got up to get more food and asked the table and him if they wanted anything and he just screamed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe left like halfway through the day and looked defeated and pissed. My gf and friend is on my side but the familyis saying I was being patronizing and trying to kill him with kindness. Which yeah that was the result but I just genuinely didn't give a fuck. I've attended lifelong friend funerals and didn't cry. I've been through some crazy shit and I'm fine. Some racist old dude is not moving me. They think I should have just gave him what he wanted a little bit. I thought they were being ridiculous and I was like \"what did you want me to start breaking out into tears or something?\" It's a whole thing that is still going on right now. Guess grandpa is pissed that I was not pissed at him which is fucking stupid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT\n\nMy Gf and friend did get involved and tell them to stop. I was holding them back and telling them just to be calm\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT\n\nThank you to everyone commenting about how well I handled and rose above it. But it wasn't even a difficult situation for me. In my mind it was like when a child is angry and you just stand there holding their head. Like the verbal version of that.

Honestly, the only scenario that makes sense to me is that he\u2019s done this before, and they know that if he can get a rise out of whichever minority he has targeted, he\u2019ll be satisfied and pipe down instead of trying to escalate.

Not because you're black, of course, but because you're so volatile! I'm assuming they're the kind of racists who will get offended if you call them that, so they need to hang on to any other excuse.

Your refusal to be intimidated, hurt, or belittled compromised his sense of power over you. \n\nThe family is saying you should have submitted to white supremacy to preserve a racist's ego.

Sounds like the old war veteran trope with a lifetime full of broken relationships.", "NTA\n\nGF and friend should not subject you to their parents and grandpa. Also I\u2019d go no contact if you ever decide to have kids in the future. They shouldn\u2019t be subjected to that racist ahole or your gf/friends parents who allow it to happen.", "`the family is saying I was being patronizing and trying to kill him with kindness.`\n\nMy answer would have been \"Sorry, I'll go kick his racist teeth in if you prefer.\"", "NTA. What did the family want him to do?  Beat Robert E. Lee-ass grandpa\u2019s ass?  OP acted with admirable restraint.", "NTA and the reaction, i.e. the lack of reaction from your girlfriends family is shameful. they should have shut the AH down immediately. Stick to your gf and her brother but refrain from meeting the other AHs ever again.", "NTA dude... you handled this like a boss... fuckin epic...\n\nI know you don't think you did anything special, but this was awesome to read...", "NTA. Wtf did I just read? This was a damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t situation. You act nice? \u201cGive the old man what he wanted!\u201d You square up and whup grandpa? (Which, let\u2019s be honest, that\u2019s the reaction he was looking for) \u201cHe\u2019s an old man, from a different time, you should have taken the high road\u201d.", "NTA - But do you really want to attend dinner with a family who doesn't defend you against this?  It was their job to rein him in, not yours.  And when I say 'their' job, I mean your gf's parents.  They should have shut him down after the first comment.", "NTA killing with kindness is how I coped with retail too. It's the best way. Sorry you had to deal with that.", "Kill them with kindness is the best way to handle such situations", "NTA They think you should've given him what he wanted? Wtf does that even mean? Acting upset would just empower him to do it to someone in the future who /couldn't/ handle it", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, you could have responded to an older white man being racist in ANY way and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be the asshole, full stop. I\u2019m glad your girlfriend and friend were on your side, but the nerve of the rest of the family to expect you to allow him to offend and berate you at the family Thanksgiving dinner is wild to me. When white people date people of color I think they hold some responsibility in terms of the boundaries they set with their own family so shit like this doesn\u2019t happen in the first place. If anyone related to me or associated with me spoke to my partner like this I would have a major problem with it, and I wouldn\u2019t back down until it was shut down. Personally, I think when they found out his plans changed they should have held a boundary. If you cannot keep your racist bullshit to yourself you are not welcome at this table. Idc who they are.", "How dare you act like a reasonable, kind person.\n\nNTA", "NTA you sound like you handled it impeccably. I\u2019m sorry you had to go through so much", "NTA. They wanted you to perform \"angry black man\" for them and you politely declined. It's nuts that they expected you to match his energy instead of telling grandpa to end his tantrum. \n\nI'd opt out of future family gatherings if possible.", "Like, what did GF want though- to popped in the mouth? or confront him and tell him to F right off? cause that is the most likely result in many cases.  Not ok to hit pp- but apparently that was what he was asking for, or to be told off- which I am sure the family would have been super happy about as well??  OP was in a no win, you can ONLY lose situation if not engaging is wrong, and engaging would have also been wrong?", "When folks are this deep into 'Grandpa's just like that', there's never a good answer. Kill him with kindness? You're patronizing. Stay silent- you're rude.  Respond with anger or logic- you're pushy at best and angry Black/marginalized stereotype. Mysteriously, these folks never seem to criticize their own responses (often silence or placation) or the fact that they just keep inviting the racist in the first place.", "And this is how you know that the rest of the family is racist, too: instead of shutting racist Grandpa down entirely, they believed the target of Grandpa's racism should've reacted in the way *they* think he should, and now they're coming after the black guy for not acting hurt or humiliated enough.\n\nOP deflected Grandpa like an absolute boss. OP, don't ever change. Definitely NTA.", "I totally agree. OP just because you weren't bothered by the racism doesn't mean you have to put up with it. If I was you I would not ever agree to be around her family again. And if she has a problem with that I would leave her. \n\nAlso a message to every person victimized by WASPS: If you're dating someone with a \"problematic family,\" don't ever go meet that family. Why should you? If they want to be a part of the family that their child/relative has created then the onus is on them to do some self reflection and unlearn their \"problematic\" behavior. They need to do the work to be worthy of being in your life not vice versa.", "legit this goes deeper than the racist grandpa. The family is MAD AT OP FOR NOT BEING OFFENDED BY THE RACISM THEY LET THEIR RELATIVE DISPLAY TOWARDS HIM.   \nSo not only are they not mad at grandpa for being horrible and increasing in offensivity of his comments, they're blaming OP for not being an obedient black man and catering to his racist overlord by reacting upset enough that overlord is proud his insults hit home as they should??? WHAT THE F  \n\n\nHonestly as a European non US-ian person, I would cut contact with this family over his as your gf and friend... even if the situation was my family insulted \\*insert anything\\* and then demanded that the victim of the abuse be MORE upset so the abuser felt happy that his abuse was hurting you.... I couldn't be around my family again ever. That is some sick sadistic shiz", "Right?  The correct thing and what might have actually registered with the old fart is is everyone at the table had been upset with him for being a racist fuck.   \u201cGive him what he wanted\u201d?  Die mad about it, OP\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s family.", "Yup. That whole family is the A. Indifference in the face of racism is just as bad as the people saying it. He obviously felt safe saying it, including with you there; which is disgusting. You are a bigger person than me, I\u2019d be out of that relationship.", "My biggest concern right now is if you are planning on marrying and having children with this woman. You may have the emotional capacity (which, by the way, I find impressive, but also know that you deserve an environment where such a thick skin is unnecessary, and I hope you find that in your day to day life) but your future children deserve to grow up in a family where neither they nor their parents are treated in such a way. \n\nAre you sure you are willing to subject your family to that? Are you sure your girlfriend would be willing to take whatever measures necessary to protect your family? Are you sure it\u2019s worth the battle?\n\nReally consider the implications of a full life with this family, and make the choice you feel you are most ready to commit to.", "Why do you want to make your life even harder by dating someone with a racist family? I know things are hard but you don\u2019t need to assume dating will also be challenging just because everything else is. You don\u2019t need to make your life more complicated because you assume that you can\u2019t have it easier. You\u2019re allowed to date someone who doesn\u2019t have a racist family. Just because they can be worse doesn\u2019t mean you need to choose a worse situation. This is something you actually have control over.", "Or they would\u2019ve leaned into the angry black man stereotype and started telling his girlfriend that she needed to be careful around him and should dump him because he isn\u2019t safe.", "Not only that but I can almost guarantee that If OP had gotten pissed ROG (racist old geez\u2026I mean grandpa) would have launched into a NEW tirade about how \u201cthey\u2019re all the same\u201d and \u201cthose stereotypes exist for a reason, you\u2019re all thugs\u201d or some garbage. \n\nHe\u2019s pissed you didn\u2019t live up to his expectations so he could justify his racism.", "It\u2019s because they want black people to know they\u2019re \u201cinferior\u201d to white people and be \u201cupset\u201d about that. Because it makes white people feel even more superior. It\u2019s so messed up", "This is what happens when you are extremely racist towards one group of people for hundreds of years. People excuse the racists and worry more about how they feelBlack people are still taught to not make trouble and to just laugh along/smile. If OP cuts them off then youre another one of those \u201cangry\u201d \u201csensitive\u201c race \u201cobsessed\u201d people. Its a catch 22. Unfortunately those who choose to do something still punished (before they would just murder or jail you). Its shocking how little push back people faced horrific violence for. The amount of propaganda and social conditioning that happened will take a long time to overcome.", "I would argue OP won because he found out his girlfriend is willing to fight for him and stand up to her family, a lot of people would\u2019ve crumbled in that situation and possibly even agreed with the family. And that knowledge is so valuable", "Thank you that makes this a little better", "Because they\u2019re all racists. They didn\u2019t care what he did, or how he reacted, they just want to ostracize him so they could be correct in their views about \u201cthose other people.\u201d", "Very true! That is at least the silver lining here", "Sorry to hear that. I think you handled yourself really well. I would\u2019ve got up and left. Surprised your girlfriend didn\u2019t. That whole family is a no.", "I don't to quibble over impact vs. intent when I said in my original comment that they were racist."]}
