I grew up in \"the hood\" so I am pretty resilient. I'm not going to get into my past much but I don't want to portray myself as some super tough guy. I just have been through so much that small things do not bother me. And by \"small\" I mean literally anything that isn't life threatening. I could come home from work to everything I own being burned and destroyed and I'd be fine. I'd be annoyed by it, but I'm alive. It's not the \"it could always be worse\" mentality. It HAS been worse. Little shit does nothing to me. Annoying traffic, people talking about me at work, rude people etc. I worked retail from 18 to 23 and I was great at it because customers snapping at me does nothing. Spew all the vile things at me, I don't care. And I've learned that it only bothers people MORE that you don't care.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI met my gf through her brother/my friend. She liked me and her bro set us up. Now her family is pretty old school. My gf and friend are cool but her family is kind of problematic. Not in a big way but in that way that a lot of older white people can be. Her grandfather on the other hand is very openly racist. I agreed to have Thanksgiving dinner at their house. He wasn't even supposed to be able to make it but in the last minute he came and it got racist real fucking quick.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not going to get into specifics but he started out somewhat racist and got more racist when he saw it did nothing for me. He would say something and I would just respond calmly and compliment him. For example, he made a racist joke about black people and cars and I complimented his car and then said the food was delicious. I didn't raise my voice or even get bothered at all. I wasn't doing it to prove a point, this is how I would basically handle an annoying retail customer. I just don't care. He got increasingly more annoyed that I wasn't hurt by his comments and felt threatened by it. I was just talking normal and he was yelling at one point. I got up to get more food and asked the table and him if they wanted anything and he just screamed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe left like halfway through the day and looked defeated and pissed. My gf and friend is on my side but the familyis saying I was being patronizing and trying to kill him with kindness. Which yeah that was the result but I just genuinely didn't give a fuck. I've attended lifelong friend funerals and didn't cry. I've been through some crazy shit and I'm fine. Some racist old dude is not moving me. They think I should have just gave him what he wanted a little bit. I thought they were being ridiculous and I was like \"what did you want me to start breaking out into tears or something?\" It's a whole thing that is still going on right now. Guess grandpa is pissed that I was not pissed at him which is fucking stupid.", "created_utc": 1671462518, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zpu1zy/aita_for_how_i_reacted_to_my_girlfriends_racist/", "score": 190, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sure, let's just let Grandpa be racist and give into that. I'm honestly in shock that anyone could think that even remotely a rational response.", "NTA You just know if you had gotten angry, they would be saying, \"OK but that's Grandpa, he's old, what do you expect? You gotta cut him slack.\" You did nothing wrong.", "NTA!! Literally what?? I can\u2019t even comprehend how you did something wrong by not stooping to his level.

Why didn't they?", "**NTA**\n\n>They think I should have just gave him what he wanted a little bit.\n\nWhat the hell is this?", "NTA. Catering to the racism of the elderly is something that needs to die off before they do. I\u2019m so sick of people excusing disgusting behavior bc of someone\u2019s age / upbringing.

Skip Christmas dinner with the girlfriend, her family isn't worth it.  NTA", "NTA, I had to chuckle at this, because you grey-rocked him and he flew of the handle. Clearly he's 'sensitive'. The family should've stepped in long before it got out of hand. That's on them and not you. \n\nYou handled it the best you could and if they don't like it, they should've done something.", "I'm gonna stipulate that your robot tendencies are a bit concerning overall, but on this matter NTA.  Your GF's family is blaming the black guy for not suffering enough from their racist relative?  This is f'd up, and they should all be doing a little reflecting on their position.", "Op, I have absolutely no idea what they wanted out of you. Did they want you to get angry? Did they want you to be openly offended and voice your objections? Did they want you to visibly bite your tongue and suffer through it begrudgingly? Did they want you to make a scene and leave? Did they want a fistfight? Honestly, the only scenario that makes sense to me is that he\u2019s done this before, and they know that if he can get a rise out of whichever minority he has targeted, he\u2019ll be satisfied and pipe down instead of trying to escalate. That being said, you are NTA. Your girlfriend\u2019s family certainly is for condoning such poor behavior.", "My guess for what your gf's family \"wanted\" was for you to get angry, get loud back, or even abusive so they could \"reasonably\" ban you from the house. Not because you're black, of course, but because you're so volatile! I'm assuming they're the kind of racists who will get offended if you call them that, so they need to hang on to any other excuse. Like they just won't feel safe with you in the house! And then they'll hope and pray their \"pure\" white daughter will stop dating you and find someone more \"appropriate\".\n\n\n\nNTA. Your approach wasn't even killing him with kindness, it was just not giving a fuck and I think brilliantly done. Good luck dating your girl, because her family is going to keep giving her (and you) so much shit.", "How is it patronizing to not take the bait he was throwing?

NTA", "They're pissed cause you were nice and didn't flip out? NTA wtf", "You and your girlfriend are NTA. But her entire family is, especially the grandpa. If someone in my family was acting racist that is not something I would tolerate. They are especially weird for expecting you to react in a certain way, can you read minds or something?", "The family saying you should've given him something is racist too. They wanted you to play a bullshit role in an obsolete social play. If you got mad, they'd say you were a bad guest. The situation was impossible and there's nothing you could've done or said for them not to say something annoying to you afterwards. You were the most mature person there and did everything you could to keep the peace while not compromising yourself or giving in to absolute nonsense. NTA 1000%.", "NTA I hate to break it to you, but the family is just as racist as Grandpa. They would of kicked Grandpa out, not asked you to be upset by him.

Well done! I don't think I'd want to give them any more time, however.", "NTA. Damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t. \n\nThe whole family have issues, except your friend & GF.", "NTA. You handled him perfectly and he humiliated himself. The family is grasping at straws trying to make this epic meltdown somehow somewhat your fault. You showed him that he doesn't matter to you. He's beneath your notice. His hate has no power. So he threw a tantrum and embarrassed himself and the rest of the family. What they wanted was for you to let him get to you to give him some satisfaction, which is awful and they should be ashamed.", "NTA. You handled him with incredible grace. What did they want you to do? Engage him? Fight him? Get upset and cry? None of that does anything and only gives him more ammunition and plays into his \"angry black man\" bias. \n\nI am concerned that her family wants you to \"give him what he wanted\" which is even more messed up than old racist white man. Complacency is why this shit won't end.", "NTA and bro genuinely? If your GF is in agreement with you that's all that matters. Her family giving you grief isn't going to affect you as much as it is going to affect her. I hope SHE'S prepared for that- going against the grain in a classically racist family/ community is a 99% of the time a death sentence to those relationships\n\nyou wanna get through this with her, methinks that's the battle ahead. these folks don't get space in your head and that's great. it's her head i think is gonna need more help tho", " NTA, I guess his game didn\u2019t work", "NTA\n\nIt's crazy they're upset because you're not upset. Why didn't any of the family try to stop  grandpa from being a racist AH?", "NGL this is kinda hilarious. I'm just picturing this old fucker dropping racist comments and just going blue in the face while you calmly eat dinner. NTA keep on rockin'. It's ok to cry, though.", "NTA - the way you handled that horrible old man was perfect, and what anyone would hope their children would do in a similar situation.  You were pleasant and ignored his nastiness, and WAY more mature than he was.  I'm shocked that his family is acting that way, they would have been all over you if you'd raised your voice to him.\n\nSounds like your GF's family are on your side, which will make everything easier since they're probably the only ones you'll see again.", "Aww, you were mean to the ignorant old racist?  You hurt his feelings by not reacting to his hate and venom? Well, too fucking bad. Fuck him and fuck the family. NTA", "NTA!  You broke their racist old bastard and they are mad at ...YOU!", "NTA \nThe audacity of your gf\u2019s family members trying to make you feel guilty for your polite response to the grandfather\u2019s repeated racist statements is honestly wild to me. Like\u2026what?! This sounds like a Get Out situation to me. You shouldn\u2019t have had to say anything at all b/c your gf and friend should have put their grandfather in his place.", "NTA and well done. He would have deserved it even if you'd gone off on him and walked out, but you weren't even arguably rude by any standard, and he's just mad because it made him look worse by comparison.", "Wow, that is intense and the whole family is racist. The fact that they didn\u2019t shut it down and blamed you for not reacting is telling. Reminds me of an old saying, \u201cgo where you are wanted and not where you are tolerated.\u201d \n\nBeing Black myself and having had a similar experience hindsight would even make me rethink my relationship with GF. Unless your GF is willing to go no contact with them. Imagine if you have kids and what they might end conditioned to accept. \n\nNTA", "NTA, her family, think you should have been what? Argumentative with him? Upset? How about they get mad at the uncle who it seems just came to ruin thanksgiving for them", "NTA - if you had argued or blown up at him, they could have written you off as an \u201cAngry Black Man\u201d yelling at poor old Grandpa who\u2019s just set in his ways. Instead you rose above their preconceived notions and made them look bad, and they can\u2019t hack it.", "NTA. That family is gross as hell and you should steer clear of them.", "NTA. Your gfs family are huge AH for expecting you to play into his games. They are also AH for enabling his bs and not standing up to him. They have shown you how little respect they have for you, and if I were you I wouldn\u2019t be going anywhere near them again anytime soon.", "NTA. \n\nThere is no reason on this earth for you to act out of character to make some trashy racist old man happy.  Why should you give away your power and engage with his bs?  That is ridiculous.  All you did was be yourself and treat him the way you would\u2019ve treated any foolish old person - politely and respectfully and like the insignificant insect that he showed himself to be.", "NTA. They're mad because Grandpa played himself. This is not a family of allies. I would think long and hard about what your interactions will be with this family throughout this relationship. If you decide this is a long-term thing, consider how any children you bring into this family will be treated - which isn't very well.", "Very odd story. Not only their reaction but yours too. \n\nObviously, NTA.", "NTA. I think I would have paid to see Racist Grandpa ridiculing himself and getting more and more heated when he saw you were unfazed by his tantrum. You were the better person and your gf's family didn't like that one bit, it seems. Keep being calm and happy with your gf, that's the best \"revenge\" you can get.", "NTA. \n\nGrandpa escalated his racism against you because he believes he is superior to you, and wanted you to feel inferior to him. Your refusal to be intimidated, hurt, or belittled compromised his sense of power over you. \n\nThe family is saying you should have submitted to white supremacy to preserve a racist's ego. They want you to have been distressed, to have been cowed, to make yourself smaller and weaker and inferior so that Grandpa can feel powerful. \n\nFuck that shit. Fuck all of them. Jesus fucking christ.", "NTA. His family said you were trying to kill him with kindness like it's a bad thing? Someone correct me if I'm way off, but isn't that what you're supposed to do?", "NTA sound hilarious to me", "NTA. And this is epic, how are they going to be upset that you killed him with kindness? That is literally the high ground, the best move, and you won. \n\nIn the face of an ugly un-fightable monster, you fkng won.", "Your level of patience is admirable. Nta, this family has a few marbles loose though \ud83e\udd23", "People can feel and think how they want. The OP did the right thing. What a great lesson in class for all of us!", "Did this family really just say that you should've engaged with his racism a little bit to spare his ego?\n\nI don't think I could've done the same in your position but kudos for keeping calm. Fuck that family. The second he said something racist he should've been out on his ass.\n\nNTA", "I'm sorry you went through that, that's fucked up and I commend you on keeping your cool, you didn't give in and give grandpa what he wanted and now he's butt hurt. I'm sorry but what was your gf doing? Or people around the table? No-one called grandpa out? THATS problematic in itself. The fact some people are saying you should have bent to a racist is fucking ridiculous, how bout tell grandpa how to behave and show respect, he needs to be told but if you were the one to do it in his mind I'm sure he would have felt like he had 'won'. Glad you didn't give him the satisfaction but someone need to say something", "hilarious that you would have been deep in your rights to tell him off and leave immediately, but because you decided to peacefully put up with him, it's your fault for not letting him hurt you", "NTA, but your gf is. Just because it doesn\u2019t phase you doesn\u2019t mean she was right to put you in that situation. She knew her family was racist, and she put the expectation on you to be kind, not on them to be hospitable.", "NTA - there would've been someone who got offended no matter how you responded. You responded in a way that brought you peace.\n\nAs a black woman I know how much energy interacting with racism can take.", "NTA. No win situation. If you would have replied in mind, they would be all over you but much worse. Great job in keeping your cool.", "NTA but I\u2019m seriously questioning your friend, the gf and hell the entire family for not saying shit and shutting his behavior down immediately", "NTA.  My gut tells me that this was the family's way of trying to get you to breakup with your girlfriend.  They were expecting you to blow - all in hopes you'd storm out or do something stupid.  You didn't play his/their game and that pissed off grandpa.  \n\nWhile grandpa is an open racist, I would probably consider the entire family racist.  It doesn't sound like they said a word while grandpa was being horrible.  That complicity is racism.\n\nI'd stay the heck away from grandpa and family.  You deserve to be treated better than that.", "And the family just sat there and didn't say anything?
