I grew up in \"the hood\" so I am pretty resilient. I'm not going to get into my past much but I don't want to portray myself as some super tough guy. I just have been through so much that small things do not bother me. And by \"small\" I mean literally anything that isn't life threatening. I could come home from work to everything I own being burned and destroyed and I'd be fine. I'd be annoyed by it, but I'm alive. It's not the \"it could always be worse\" mentality. It HAS been worse. Little shit does nothing to me. Annoying traffic, people talking about me at work, rude people etc. I worked retail from 18 to 23 and I was great at it because customers snapping at me does nothing. Spew all the vile things at me, I don't care. And I've learned that it only bothers people MORE that you don't care.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI met my gf through her brother/my friend. She liked me and her bro set us up. Now her family is pretty old school. My gf and friend are cool but her family is kind of problematic. Not in a big way but in that way that a lot of older white people can be. Her grandfather on the other hand is very openly racist. I agreed to have Thanksgiving dinner at their house. He wasn't even supposed to be able to make it but in the last minute he came and it got racist real fucking quick.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not going to get into specifics but he started out somewhat racist and got more racist when he saw it did nothing for me. He would say something and I would just respond calmly and compliment him. For example, he made a racist joke about black people and cars and I complimented his car and then said the food was delicious. I didn't raise my voice or even get bothered at all. I wasn't doing it to prove a point, this is how I would basically handle an annoying retail customer. I just don't care. He got increasingly more annoyed that I wasn't hurt by his comments and felt threatened by it. I was just talking normal and he was yelling at one point. I got up to get more food and asked the table and him if they wanted anything and he just screamed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe left like halfway through the day and looked defeated and pissed. My gf and friend is on my side but the familyis saying I was being patronizing and trying to kill him with kindness. Which yeah that was the result but I just genuinely didn't give a fuck. I've attended lifelong friend funerals and didn't cry. I've been through some crazy shit and I'm fine. Some racist old dude is not moving me. They think I should have just gave him what he wanted a little bit. I thought they were being ridiculous and I was like \"what did you want me to start breaking out into tears or something?\" It's a whole thing that is still going on right now. Guess grandpa is pissed that I was not pissed at him which is fucking stupid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT\n\nMy Gf and friend did get involved and tell them to stop. I was holding them back and telling them just to be calm\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT\n\nThank you to everyone commenting about how well I handled and rose above it. But it wasn't even a difficult situation for me. In my mind it was like when a child is angry and you just stand there holding their head. Like the verbal version of that. This whole situation didn't get any rise out of me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT\n\nWe've been together for three years now.

Did they want a fistfight? Honestly, the only scenario that makes sense to me is that he\u2019s done this before, and they know that if he can get a rise out of whichever minority he has targeted, he\u2019ll be satisfied and pipe down instead of trying to escalate.

Your refusal to be intimidated, hurt, or belittled compromised his sense of power over you. \n\nThe family is saying you should have submitted to white supremacy to preserve a racist's ego.
