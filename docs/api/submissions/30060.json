{"id": 30060, "submission_id": "17krkqj", "title": "AITA for not \"supporting\" my friend for having multiple sugar daddies?", "selftext": "One of my closest friends has been going on dates with older men since our junior year of college. We are now in our mid/late 20s, and I no longer support her endeavor.Our third year of college, her insane parents told her she needs to pay 1.2k a month (along with their three other children, yes, that is in fact 4.8k a month), to help pay for their mortgage. As she began going on dates, I was a little worried so I tagged along to every date and sat at the bar by myself to keep an eye on her. I have attended every date since 2017, except for this last weekend.\n\nOn Friday she asked if I could go out with her, but since I am a law student it's really hard for me to use my time to sit at a bar alone. I told her I have finals in a few weeks, but I'll have my phone on loud if she needs me. She was a little annoyed, but still went out on the date. At around 1am she calls me that he was a creep and basically yelled at me for not being there for her or supporting her. She was crying and calling me a \"fake feminist\" and so on. She apologized the next day, but I was still pretty upset with how she treated me.\n\nThe next day - Saturday, my boyfriend and I threw a Halloween party, she was invited as were our other friends including some co-workers. She got really drunk and began telling some of my other friends that she has multiple sugar daddies and went into great detail about her \"business\". At the end of the night, a few of my friends told me that I need to have a serious talk with my friend regarding her \"extra curricular activities.\" They went on to say that as a future lawyer the people I surround myself with are extremely important and that ultimately I need to have a hard conversation with her or cut her off.\n\nI decided to have a talk with her because she is one of my good friends and I believe friends need to be checked sometimes in order to be the best version of themselves. This did NOT bode well for me. She began screaming, \"You're an elitist who thinks you're better than me because you now go to law school. You're a fake feminist and everyone knows it. This is so pathetic that you think this isn't an actual entrepreneurial deal for me. You haven't been kind to me the last two years...\" It went on for a while, but I just ended up hanging up on her because quite frankly it was exhausting.\n\nSo, Am I the Asshole for no longer supporting her doing this, I do feel bad about it and the whole elitist thing is messing with my head.\n\n*Edit*: Thank you all for the advice! I have come to the conclusion that I am *dumb* and should not let people take advantage of me in the name of kindness. Additionally, I attended these dates with her because that is what I felt like was considered a good friend, I also did not want to take money because it conflicts with my morals, I simply accompanied her for the sake of being friends. I have no problem with sex work, while morally it is out of my comfort zone, I really have no right to police how another person lives their life. With that being said, the party where she told my other friends about her job, she went into grave detail about the acts she does. The work she plans on doing, the things she does with clients and attempted to make a move on a friend's boyfriend who is pretty well off. I will definitely be talking to my friend about her profession and explaining that while I support her as a person, I can no longer attend every date or have her telling people details about sex. I think we are past the point in our age to be casually dropping how/where/what sex positions to acquaintances at a party, we are no longer in college.", "created_utc": 1698776381, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17krkqj/aita_for_not_supporting_my_friend_for_having/", "score": 585, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's also clearly taking out a lot of her own insecurity on you to guilt you into staying in that spot.\n\nIf this really is an actual entrepreneurial endeavor and she values her safety, she should hire someone to ensure her safety - not expect friends to fill that slot for free. This is much different from making sure a friend makes it home safe from a bar in college.\n\nIt sucks that her parents also suck and are *probably* charging her way more than market rate for a bedroom at home. At the end of the day, you should focus on convincing her and her sisters to get an apartment together instead of living under that financially abusive roof. At the same time, the baggage you carry as her friend may not allow her to see that line of reasoning from you. She may always be insecure around you and may never really hear the information that needs to be given.\n\nYou're definitely NTA here even if your friends were off the mark a bit on the \"who you surround yourself with\" comment.\n\nYour time is valuable no matter who you are.

You can't control their actions.", "NTA. There\u2019s a word for people who offer intimacy for money. Prostitutes. Let her use some of that money to hire a bodyguard if she thinks it\u2019s necessary.", "NTA for any reason but your friend seems pretty delusional for thinking this is \"entrepreneurial\" and that you are a \"fake feminist\" for no longer supporting her. You simply need to tell her you love her but cannot support her \"entrepreneurial\" decisions any longer and you need to focus on your career and schooling.", "NTA of course, but I'm curious: What does she think will happen if she stops paying her parents' \"mortgage\"? She's not even living in the same state according to one of your other comments. Is this \"mortgage payment\" the main/only reason she has sugar daddies?", "NTA.

It\u2019s not your job to be her bodyguard when she willingly engages in potentially dangerous activities for money. \n\nIf this is the career choice she\u2019s making, she needs to figure out a better plan for her safety than guilting her friend into attending dates with her.

No shame in being a sugar baby (no it's not prostitution but yes it is sex work, there's differences) but she's doing it in a really dumb way. I sugar date too. You don't drag a friend along to every date, that's a ridiculous ask. Set up a Life360 with a trusted friend, run background checks on these guys, meet in public places until you're comfortable with them (still keep your location on), be prepared to call an Uber or drive away, and most of all, *be discreet*. She's going home with creeps and bragging to strangers about her lifestyle, it's a bad look. You're not wrong for being upset with her, she wants the glamour of the sugar lifestyle but wants you to shoulder the responsibility of it for her.", "The difference between a lawyer and a prostitutes? A prostitute will stop screwing you after you die. \n\nThe difference between a lawyer and a prostitutes?

You are nta for withdrawing your support. However allowing your lawyer friends to talk down on who you have in your personal lives and taking that to the friend was wrong. She's definitely TA for everything she said besides the elitist thing, that was half right.", "NTA  \nI fail to see what you are getting out of this \"friendship\". She is essentially prostituting herself and using you as a safety net in case she runs into trouble. You have spent 6 years acting as her unpaid wingman. Obviously she hasn't appreciated it for a minute.", "You're the fake feminist when *she* relies directly on men to pay her bills? That's rich. Obviously NTA.", "It sounds like you supported her right up until your other friends pointed out she might hurt your reputation. If I'm reading that right, then YTA. Well, no, your friend is acting awfully entitled to your time so actually she's TA too. So actually ESH.\n\nTo be clear, it was completely reasonable to stop babysitting her *every date* after six years! Even if you are 100% respectful of her work, it's not your job to make it safe for her. The problem is that you didn't feel the need to talk to her until you moved into a different world. I'm not surprised she sees that as an elitist point of view.", "I'm confused. The issue isn't that you don't want to continue going on every date, because you told her to call you and that was fine. Her reaction to it sucked, but otherwise, it seemed like that worked for you.\n\nWhat seems to be the issue is that some of your law school friends found out how she's paying her bills, and their judgement of the situation was enough for you to either suddenly view it was wrong, or for you to finally tell her how you feel about it. Instead of it being an issue of you not liking it, however, you told her she wasn't being \"her best self\" because she's making money by giving men affection...\n\nIf I have all that correct, then...Yeah, kinda YTA. You're allowed to not like her \"job.\" You're allowed not to want to continue a friendship.

Is she helping you study during law school?  I think not.  She's not a friend but a user, time to dump her.", "You aint a sugar baby if you have multiple sugar daddies. Thats a hooker with a cult following", "Definitely NTA for stopping going on the dates but tbh kinda TA for cutting off your friend for making money in the way that she does when her parents put such an unfair burden on her. It sounds like she was backed into a corner and this is how her life has become. You don\u2019t need to take her around your law colleagues but why would you stop considering her your friend?

Your friend is trash.", "ESH obviously she sucks. She needs to get herself an actual bodyguard. because if we think about it, in reality, what the actual fuck would you do if she was being kidnapped? do you have special protection skills? probably not. not only is she disrespectful of your time, but also of YOUR safety because it could 100% end just as badly for you too. And she also sucks for not knowing what\u2019s appropriate and inappropriate to talk about with YOUR friends and coworkers. To be honest, I really probably wouldn\u2019t have invited her. I have some messy friends too and it\u2019s a personal rule for me to not introduce my different friend groups to each other\n\nYou kind of suck too. It IS elitist to have this whole \u201cyou\u2019re a future lawyer surround yourself with high class people\u201d bullshit. You know how many lawyers do coke??????? That shit is hypocritical as fuck. And anyway, my grandfather who was a prominent nyc judge back in his day always used to say that any job that lets you provide for your family is a respectable job.

While I agree your friend can not expect you to be there at all her dates, the reality is sex work is work. Being a sugar baby is helping her in this increasingly fucked up society and she has nothing to be ashamed about.", "I think you might be missing something. You're hearing words but they don't match the feelings and so this friendship is falling apart, but you need to be honest.\n\n1) Your time is worth money.  You should have been paid for what you did, attending her dates.  \n\n2)YOU ARE NOT NOR EVER WERE A PIMP.  People suggesting that need to read up on Iceberg Slim and STFU.  You provided a well-needed friendly face on a date with a stranger. That's something a friend provides another friend on a date all the time.  However, the frequency and your cooperation made it into a job, which you volunteered to do for free. That probably has led to some resentment. Be open about that and what your time is worth.  This is where you stand up for yourself and your value.\n\n3) Your friend went through trauma. You are not hearing that.  She blames you because she counted on you and you weren't there to do your job. Not your job?  Then why did you make it your job??  The understanding needed to come well before your friend had no other recourse. That's on you both. You for not getting your needs met and her for relying on you without real discussion about values snd your time.\n\n4) Your friend feels desperate.  That mortgage? Wtf is she talking about? Who's mortgage is 4.5K a month?? 4 adult kids who left home - why would they all be splitting the mortgage??  Something doesn't add up here but that mortgage story is goofy. Regardless, your friend feels trapped. Whatever the money is for, she feels locked into this cycle now.\n\n5) Your friend is a sex worker. Admit that. You condoned it explicitly with your aid. Admit that. Now decide if you think some societal shame is worth your actual friendship. But take heed: lawyers aren't the icons of propriety your student friends believe them to be, and defense attorneys routinely associate with all kinds of people. If you had empathy for your friend before, what changed?\n\n6) She got drunk and was looking for sympathy. Your friends can be uncomfortable but she's seeking to normalize her life and live without shame and you let your friends judge her.  I don't know the laws in your country/state but her business isn't really any less legitimate than being a lawyer if she handles it properly. I'll bet her hourly rate is better, too.\n\n7) You're at an impasse. You seem to be conflicted on support. You feel taken advantage of, but that's really on you in the end. Your friend is lashing out and feeling unsupported. Because you are pulling support. Maybe you need to. That's not what's wrong.\n\nThis is where you act like an adult. You sit down. You talk it out, with empathy AND honesty. If you don't approve, be real about that. If you are worried, be upfront about that. If you're feeling some weird vicarious shame, be honest about it.\n\nI don't know if she's drifting down a dark path but I know your friends are only witnessing the edge of some trauma, they don't really know shit about it from what you wrote.  You're the only one who can decide your feelings about your friend.\n\nBut before you toss it away, I'd at least take that moment, have a sit down, open up to a reset, or a respectful parting of the ways. That's just a choice on how to honor your own half of friendship, as far as I can see. Only you can decide if that conversation is worth it but it sounds like both you and your friend might grow from it.\n\nGood luck and NAH", "I don't think you're the AH but you do sound a bit elitist, or at least your new friends are. My friend group has been together from high school, and includes everyone, from a sex worker to a doctor. \n\nThat said, your friend should be taking more precautions to stay safe.
