Many humans also believe we shouldn\u2019t use anything from animals, even things like honey. Doesn\u2019t mean you need to change anything, just use labels.", "NTA.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to eat it, he doesn\u2019t have to. This is no different than a vegetarian coming to one of these parties and railing against the host serving meat.", "I'm going with NTA because of how experimental your friends are. \n\nIf you correctly labelled them, then they could opt out.", "NTA. You have a group of adventurous eaters. Depending on the group it\u2019s possible horse was a controversial choice (ie some people view eating horse as normal and others see it as the equivalent of eating a dog) but you offered an alternative. However it sounds like only one person in the group had an issue with it and instead of having an adult conversation is being immature about it. I\u2019d maybe discuss with the group whether you all should give a warning as to what the recipe will be for your evenings so people can decide whether to attend and avoid this happening again, but you are NTA for the food you prepared.", "As a horse rider and your local crazy horse girl, NTA\n\nIf it\u2019s humanely killed and properly used, and especially if it\u2019s traditional, there shouldn\u2019t be a problem", "NTA. I\u2019m curious why this guy is traumatized by this but not Haggis or squirrels?? I mean as long as your food was clearly labeled he needs to move on.", "Nta he needs to drop it or stop coming.  Plenty of people around the world eat horse.", "NTA\n\nWhat did he think would happen joining a group dedicated to eating exotic food?\n\nYou can do a lot worse for offending the sensibilities than horse meat.", "Of course NTA. \n\nCultural mores about what animals are for eating, or what part of an animal are for eating, or not, are *very very strong*. It's just a weird quirk of human nature. We all have irrational but unshakeable feelings about it.\n\n So it's not his fault that he feels strongly about whether or not to eat horse. \n\nBUT if you're part of a group whose whole point is to try dishes from different cultures, then you have to be ready to put your own cultural conditioning aside and be open to others.\n\nHe is failing to do that. He has no grounds to be mad at you, and he needs to open his mind or stop participating. Definitely needs to stop harassing you about it.", "He doesn't have to eat it if he doesn't want to.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s what your friend group does, and considering you could purchase it legally and locally, there\u2019s no issues with serving it.", "NTA. I\u2019m Australian and many non-Australians have difficulty with the fact we eat kangaroo. It isn\u2019t for everyone, but as long as it\u2019s clearly labelled and someone has a choice not to eat it, then there\u2019s no issue. Same with horse. He could have just eaten the mutton and minded his own business.", "NTA.  I know people from Europe, Asia, and Oceania that eat that meat.  It's an arbitrary line for them to draw.", "NTA at all.\nYour group of friends has a passion for shock value in eating food, specifically dead animals. Obscure meat.\n\nHorse, from a butcher (one of your friends hunted squirrel\u2026 to me that would be a \u201cnope\u201d just because of parasites) is 100% in this category and should be readily accepted. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not a meat eater and I wouldn\u2019t eat horse. So when I say: remove this friend from the group, they didn\u2019t pass THIS VERY SPECIFIC VIBE CHECK, I mean it.", "It blows my mind constantly how meat eaters can justify eating one animal but judge others for eating another animal. It's so effin dumb. OP, NTA. One dead animal body on your table is no different from any other dead animal body.", "NTA. I\u2019d rather eat horse that haggis", "NTA ~~INFO~~\n\n> I found a local butcher that sold chevaline.

Your friend is being unfair. Uninviting them might hurt their feelings though and make things tense with friends making them choose sides.

Still, this is sort of the environment you\u2019re all going into with this intentionally adventurous meat eaters club (fun pig out idea, by the way), and at any rate he\u2019s being way more of a jerk about it than needed. You don\u2019t need to be so sheepish.\n\nIf you showed up with Dog\u2026 maybe different story. I\u2019m that case\u2026 we might have beef.", "NTA. Horsemeat is pretty common, especially in UK sausages lol. I'm pretty sure many ppl have eaten it at some point in their lives.", "NTA your friend is insensitive. Does he go to Indian restaurants and criticize them for serving goat? Heaven forbid he ever go to a street market in Asia.", "NTA \n\nYou all are very adventurous in terms of food. It is safe to assume if a culture deems something to be food, then it very well could be a meal you all eat some point. Personally, if I found myself enjoying being a part of a group like this, and then I found out someone served dog, I would be uncomfortable even if there were other options. I would be uncomfortable knowing that my friends ate dog. But that discomfort would have to fall on me and I would have to deal with that myself because that's what I would have signed up for. Maybe this individual needs to be reminded that nothing is off the table.", "Fake tacos?

He is not the god of protein choices on this planet, while I certainly would not approve of \u201cJeffery Dahmer\u201d style of eating (yes I am aware of some cultures just need to draw a personal line \ud83d\ude02) I am not going to judge people\u2019s choice of animal meat because it is not something my culture traditionally eats. He sounds like an AH anyway parties are meant to be enjoyed.", "NTA, but as a fellow adventurous eater, give snake a go. It's surprisingly good, like eel.", "NTA, horse is delicious and the only reason he's opposed is cuz way back when, we rode the horses and ate the cows, so now we have a cultural emotional attachment to one instead of the other.", "No more of an AH than you\u2019d be for serving pig, or chicken, or calf, or cow  or rabbit, or deer, or trout, or anything else with a life it would presumably like to enjoy and a central nervous system. To take exception to horse but not pig or cow, etc. is such extreme cognitive dissonance it\u2018s basically delusional.
