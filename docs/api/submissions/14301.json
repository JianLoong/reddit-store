Healthy conversations discussing insecurities lead to a stronger relationship. \n\nBut OPs actions are ridiculous.

I want to preface that I trust you implicitly and I appreciate how open you\u2019ve been with me about your past. I just want to let you know that I am anxious/worried/insecure/[insert emotion here] about being in a situation where I may have to interact with your ex. Just wanted to let you know I will be cordial, but if we could maybe keep our interactions at the wedding limited, I would really appreciate it.\u201d \nIs how one should approach this. \n\nIf she cares about him, she will appreciate this and do her best to mediate things. \n\nBut he\u2019s acting like a child."]}
