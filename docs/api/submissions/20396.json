My husband was at work and I couldn\u2019t reach him so I told my 17 year old to take the kids home (a few blocks away) and I started calling friends and family to watch the kids. My mom was the only person available.

But regardless of if you continue having family/friends watch the kids or if you have the 17 year old do it definitely keep them away from your mom.

Now your mom needs to back the F off, she has not been trained on childhood traumas and reactions of kids especially those who dealt with lots of fold insecurities to say the least. She is giving them a complex and triggering them. \n\nWhile I encourage you teaching heathy snack choices and portion control and exercise, forcing it or not giving food will cause more problems and they will end up with issues in adulthood when they can buy whatever they want and that\u2019s when their weight will blow up if they haven\u2019t worked through their trauma and understand everything in moderation.", "NTA - Your kids.
