They were **starved** to the point they both require feeding tubes to get the proper amount of nutrition. \n\nThey both probably have CPTSD as a result of being **starved** by their biological parents. One of the children (17f) was so traumatized that having her little sister and her\u2019s access to food restricted, she locked herself and her little sister in her room. \n\nThis is not difficult to understand. They have endured severe trauma at the hands of the people who were supposed to keep them safe. Their trust issues and triggers are not, \u201ctantrums\u201d. Their behavior is exactly how children and adults who have CPTSD behave. \n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with you? \n\nWho hurt you? \n\nSeriously, you need to look inside yourself and figure out why you would say something so cruel and stupid.", "I had to hide food in my room so my dad wouldn\u2019t eat it.
