Unless you think a pair of previously starved children are being spoiled for having the audacity to eat a snack.\n\n\n>I have known kids who have gone through horrific childhoods, and as a result of their backgrounds, everyone handled them with kid gloves and let them do anything, as people pitied them. The kids resented being pitied, but quickly learned to take advantage of the situation. They, in turn, developed an entitlement about the world and other people, and would go on to do the most horrific, abusive things, as they were never told no, nor checked for their behavior, further perpetuating the cycle. OP is not doing any favors by enabling them.\n\n\nYour experience is NOT OP's experience, clearly and you're too ignorant to actually notice that detail so you just want to sit here and act like every situation is exactly the same.
