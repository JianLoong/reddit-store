I (30f) was asked by my sister (28f) if the maxi dress she was trying on would be inappropriate for our upcoming Mother\u2019s Day family celebration. \n\nIt\u2019s a skims knock off so if you google \u201cskims maxi dress nude\u201d you\u2019ll get the idea. She tried it on for me and of course she\u2019s stunning. She\u2019s tall and very curvy with a face of a model. If this was for a date I would okay it in a heartbeat, it\u2019s definitely her style. But since we\u2019re going to be seeing our whole family (including older grandparents), I told her that I thought it looked amazing but wasn\u2019t appropriate for a family gathering. It\u2019s very thin material and hugs every single curve, you can pretty much see everything. \n\nShe got understandably upset, which I should\u2019ve predicted because I could tell she liked it. She said she didn\u2019t understand my reasoning because it wasn\u2019t see through and said I\u2019m just trying to police her body. It wasn\u2019t my intention, but I think it\u2019s pretty much the definition of what I ended up doing. I just know how our family is and we had a similar incident at Christmas when she wore a super thin body suit that ended up being see through. It made people uncomfortable. I can see it from the older generation\u2019s side too, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a limit to how much of your adult granddaughters body you want to see. But I also don\u2019t want her to feel restricted. \n\nI was trying to prevent a similar situation. I don\u2019t want her to have a bad day once she realizes she\u2019s making people uncomfortable. Maybe I\u2019m overthinking this and should\u2019ve just agreed with her opinion on the dress. I kind of wished I had just lied. Idk Reddit I need help, AITA? \n\nAnd even if not, am I just in the wrong?

For Mother's Day with Grandma, Kate Middleton is a better direction than Kim Kardashian.", "NTA \n\n\nShe ASKED if you thought it was appropriate. You can your opinion. It wasn't unsolicited.

You're not stopping her from wearing it. She can make that decision for herself. Normally, when people ask that question, they're already on the fence about if they'd be comfortable in the outfit for the given occasion. She asked you, so that leads you to believe she trusts your assessment of the family gathering. I'm sure you wouldn't pull her away from the door and shame her if she'd just shown up in it. \n\nShe can still wear whatever she wants. All you gave was an opinion.", "NTA-if she doesn't want an honest answer she shouldn't ask.", "It\u2019s not your responsibility to stop her from making other family members uncomfortable, that\u2019s on her.

She asked for your opinion, and you gave your honest one. She opened the door to be judged when she asked. If you gave your opinion unsolicited, that's different. \n\nI looked up the dress and it seems okay, but I don't know your family and I don't know how she looks in it so I have no opinion there.", "NTA. She asked, you answered. And I\u2019m sorry to say this, but you\u2019re not wrong. Certain social situations have certain dress codes.\n\nIt\u2019s a murky area because I\u2019ve seen women criticized for wearing perfectly reasonable or event appropriate outfits by those I consider judgmental and prudish. And probably just jealous. On the flip side, I\u2019ve also seen people wear outrageously inappropriate things to various places, and I include men in that statement. As someone who worked retail and had to work hard to keep the store perfectly clean, there\u2019s nothing like the asshole covered in dry wall dust or beach sand who thinks it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to waltz into a store getting everything dirty and still be politely waited on because he has money to spend. I\u2019ve also just recently been watching my family deal with a recently divorced in-law who is wearing very sexy & skimpy bathing suits and outfits around the family beach house and trying to \u201csubtly\u201d flirt with married Dads who are guests and it\u2019s\u2026not good. I\u2019m very liberal and I\u2019ve been outright shocked and horrified by she\u2019s wearing around our house. It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nSo, yes. People can dress completely inappropriately to certain functions and other people will notice and they will be uncomfortable or even angry about it. But telling people what they don\u2019t want to hear, especially if it\u2019s critical or hampering their ability to do whatever they want whenever they want, usually doesn\u2019t go over well. Your sister is one of those, so let her fuck around and find out on her own.", "Not at all, she's being the selfish A$$, wanting to show off her ass to the family... clearly the dress is gorgeous,it's also completely inappropriate for family gathering", "She asked you because she knows it\u2019s inappropriate.

She wanted you to say it was ok so there was someone on her side when she got called out on it. NTA", "I'm an ugly fat dude. I once wore an unbuttoned flannel shirt over a t-shirt to a family function. As soon as I walked in, my grandfather told me to button my shirt up. So I understand that your grandparents might not appreciate their sexy granddaughter dressing sexy, even though it's not a problem, it's a question of respect. NTA.", "NTA. Because she asked.
