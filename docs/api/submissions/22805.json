Those friends brought a few other friends as well. We were cool with that and excited to meet them. One of the new friends asked me why I wasn't drinking with everyone else. This guy bought a round of shots for everyone, including me, but I just said \"thank you, but I'm actually a recovering alcoholic. Want to stay sober.\" Before he could reply, one of my friends butt in with \"since when?\" She didn't say that with any kind of malice, she genuinely sounded curious and concerned. I think she was kind of hurt that she never knew about any sort of drinking problems I might have had.\n\nI explained the following, but the explanation they got was a bit briefer: back in 2017, I went through a harsh breakup with an abusive partner. The day after the breakup, my granddad who I was very close with passed away, and I lost my job because of a car accident. I was angry, so I started drinking a lot. I decided that life was just easier to deal with if I stayed drunk. While it wasn't about the alcohol, I still drink on occasion, but it's so rare that I wouldn't even say I'm a social drinker. I'll have a rare glass of wine but that's it. The hard drinking went on for 6 months before I realized I needed to stop. \n\nThe guy then called me an AH and said it's sick of me to use a legitimate disease for pitty and said I wouldn't go to a bar if I ACTUALLY were a recovering alcoholic. I believe you don't need to drink to have fun, but I guess he disagrees. He didn't say anything to indicate that he or anyone he knows has a bad history with substance abuse of any kind, so I don't really know where this rage came from. I didn't argue with him because when I get sucked into a conflict like this, I tend to shut down the verbal part of myself so I don't make things worse. After he said what he needed to, I just said I was sorry for upsetting him, went to my fianc\u00e9 and asked if he was ready to leave. After we left, my fianc\u00e9 said I didn't do anything wrong.\n\nWhile I don't think I'm technically a recovering alcoholic, I don't know a better way to put it in a short and brief statement. I had a really bad and unhealthy relationship with alcohol, I'm aware of it, and have bettered that part of myself. I don't let it ruin everyone else's fun though. Having a drink here and there doesn't give me an urge to keep drinking. It's only if I'm drinking with the intent of getting drunk that it becomes an issue, so I simply just *don't do that.* I haven't had any problems with it since, until this.\n\nSo, because I guess I'm not actually a recovering alcoholic, AITA for saying I am?", "created_utc": 1689931466, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155iv96/aita_for_saying_that_im_a_recovering_alcoholic/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA", "First off I (m24) wanna say congrats and that I'm proud that you recognized you had a problem and helped yourself instead of continuing down that destructive path.  I myself am a recovering alcoholic (3 months sober tomorrow) after years of binge drinking which eventually lead to drinking everyday, often all day. Also respect to you for how you handled that AH who said what he said to you cuz if someone said something like that to me we'd be throwing hands loll. Anyways with all that being said, you're definitely NTA.", "NTA and for the record, most recovering alcoholics can go to bars and not drink.  It's what the \"recovery\" part is all about.", "NTA. He's mad because he's an alcoholic.", "NTA.   I  enjoy drinking more than is healthy, but never push drinks on people and never make them explain.     \n\n\nMaybe they want to be the DD, maybe they are on some medication that clashes with it, maybe their stomach is upset, maybe they have a headache and it will make it worse, maybe they are having terrible hay fever/allergies and they don't want to be even more zonked out.   \n\n\nAs I said, I enjoy drinking more than is healthy, but sometimes I'm even  just not in the mood.  \n\n\nInstead of apologizing, just tell them to fuck off.", "I\u2019m a recovering alcoholic. If you haven\u2019t already tried Alcoholics Anonymous, I suggest you do 90 meetings in 90 days, get an AA Sponsor, begin working the AA 12 Steps, and not drink or use any mind altering substances during the 90 days. I\u2019d say you are a soft AH  for misrepresenting yourself as a recovering alcoholic if you are still occasionally drinking and NOT actively attending AA meetings. In the future, when someone buys you a dink without you asking for one, all you have to say is, \u201cNo thank you.\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m good, thanks.\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m driving later, thanks.\u201d or any of 300 other responses other than \u201cI\u2019m a recovering alcoholic.\u201d\n\nI think you\u2019re a soft AH because you weren\u2019t being intentionally disrespectful of actually recovering alcoholics, but if you truly understood the struggles of members of of AA you wouldn\u2019t decline a drink by saying you\u2019re a recovering alcoholic when you aren\u2019t. I do applaud you for being able to reduce your drinking of alcohol, but the 12 Steps are about living a sober life, and not only about not drinking or reducing one\u2019s drinking of alcohol.\n\nI wish you the best!", "NTA you don\u2019t have to acknowledge gatekeepers. My late uncle, who was an alcoholic, did not drink at bars, just told buddies that he had some gastric issues and was sticking to nonalcoholic drinks. Bartenders were good about it apparently. He drank only at home.", "NTA   \n\n\nIt's so weird that people think they can or should police how people describe their situations, as if there's one way to be an \"alcoholic\" and if you don't meet that way then it doesn't count   \n\n\nIt sounds to me like you have a good understanding of your issues and set a good boundary.   \n\n\nAlso to add that I know people who would definitely describe themselves as having problems with alcohol use who have an occasional drink, e.g., beer or glass of wine but never hard liquor. Everybody finds their own way.", "I've only heard of alchoholics not being allowed a DROP of alchohol ever again even if they learn to moderate on US tv shows tbh.  I always understood it as you only go full on no view, taste or smell of it if you really know that you cant control yourself otherwise,", "Antibiotics messes with birth control.  From one woman to another.", "Humans evolved alongside alcohol, so it makes sense why it's the exception. Alcohol is a cultural thing. It doesn't excuse behavior or make it right. But understanding how ingrained in human history it is helps me accept everyone's blase attitude of such a harmful substance. Our ancestors would gather fallen fruit, and sometimes, the fruit was there for a bit too long. Fermentation occurs, and suddenly, our species isn't  even homo sapiens sapiens yet, and they're getting drunk. \n\nAlcohol was also the only safe form of liquid intake in certain places for certain parts of history. Europe is a great example since I believe there are several individual instances of people drinking beer or wine due to the water not being clean. I think alcohol became an issue when humans moved to a more agricultural living. I know that in Europe, women were the beer brewers for a long time. It was seen as an art. But as it became more profitable, men in the church were like, \"We want to make the money trading beer. It's time for a witch hunt!\" \n\nSorry, the history of alcohol is fascinating to me. I had a problem with drinking around the ages of 18-22. The alcohol we consume now is so much more potent than the fermented fruits that introduced our ancestors to the substance.", "You don't actually have to spend decades drinking yourself into hospitalization to get the title of alcoholic.  People like you get called \"high bottom drunks\" in AA because your rock bottom wasn't quite as deep and dire as some was... but it existed.  And the world is full of recovering alcoholics who visit or even work in bars... while a lot of people in recovery prefer to avoid social drinking environments, there's plenty of others who are able to reconcile it with their recovery.  You're NTA.", "NTA, pure and simple.  Someone who reacts with that much anger to your sobriety knows deep down that they have a problem relationship with alcohol.", "NTA. This guy is an aggressive freak.\n\nAlcoholism shows up in different ways. Some people are addicted in a physical sense. These are the people that get DTs, will harm themselves drinking rubbing alcohol, and often can never drink again. They are the same as a crack or heroin addict.\n\nOthers use drinking to self-medicate physical or emotional pain, trauma, or mental illness. People who only fall into this group, without the physical addiction, often can stop drinking if they treat/manage/address their underlying condition. They may be able to manage their alcohol intake later in life, but are often careful to avoid places/behaviors that mimic their dysfunctional drinking.\n\nIf you drink long enough, a type 2 may develop a chemical dependency like a type 1. And a type 1 will often find that the destruction their alcoholism is wrecking on their life is causing depression/anxiety/trauma, and also use drinking as an escape from that pain. \n\nAnd some people are both types from the get-go.\n\nYou were a Type 2. You managed to quit before you did serious harm to your body or others. You also recognize that drinking under certain conditions (in bars, to excess, certain beverages) will likely encourage you to engage in your unhealthy coping mechanisms. \n\nAnyone who remains drunk for 6 months has a serious history of alcohol abuse. Whether or not you had DTs is none of that guy\u2019s fucking business.", "Wow NTA AT ALL! This dude is prying. One thing I learned in outpatient is that you don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation as to why you\u2019re not drinking. You don\u2019t drink. Period. If you want to share then go ahead! If people are going to ask prying questions they don\u2019t get to get mad at the answers! Also I\u2019m a recovering alcoholic and I bartend for goodness sake, so saying a recovering alcoholic shouldn\u2019t be in a a bar setting is ridiculous. Some people in recovery can\u2019t handle a bar and that\u2019s okay, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can never go to a bar again.\n\nEveryone\u2019s recovery journey is wildly different and he doesn\u2019t get to sit  here and tell you what you are and what you aren\u2019t. I\u2019m impressed that you were able to pull it together after 6 months of hard drinking. It took me years to realize I had a problem and props to you, my friend, for making the right decisions for yourself. \n\nIt\u2019s really important for me to again reiterate that you are NTA and this dude has some issues he needs to work on. You\u2019ve already put the work in and know yourself better than anyone so don\u2019t let him get to you! You\u2019re doing great and I\u2019m really proud of you.", "NTA! You've figured out what your sobriety means to you. Recovered alcoholics who avoid places with alcohol are still letting the disease control them. Drinking is so prevalent in society these days that it's hard to avoid. Being able to go to a bar and not drink is such a huge step. I'm so proud of you!! Keep up the good work!!", "NTA\n\nI am in recovery, and one thing I hear again and again is that the only person who can decide I am an alcoholic is me.\n\nOther people can tell me I have a problem, but, other people don't have to do so in order for me to make that decision.\n\nOther people can go to AA, or not, and still consider themselves to be an alcoholic.\n\nI go to bars with work people from time to time, and they know I am in recovery. \n\nI don't hang out in them just because I want to go to a bar, because as they say \"if you hang out in a barber shop, eventually you are gonna get a haircut\"\n\n I know a few people like you - decided you were an alcoholic, or could be one, and stopped.  \n\nSo, fuck them and their judgemental ass.  I don't need anyone gatekeeping recovery. It's hard enough to get in as it is.\n\nWelcome to the team.", "NTA but \"no thank you\" is really all you need to say. Any follow up questions (which would be rude af) can be dealt with by responding \"thank you but I really don't care for a shot/drink/beer right now.\" Rinse and repeat.\n\nIf they get really pushy say \"why are you so invested in my drinking this shot? Have you roofied it or something?\" That should hopefully shut them down.", "It's very true. I'm a recovering alcoholic. I've been sober for 21 years. A lot of people didn't know I was an alcoholic back when I was drinking, because I was a quiet and functional alcoholic, not a big partier, and I didn't \"hit rock bottom.\" I just knew it was time, even though it took me a while to commit to quitting. Some people still question it though--just happened to me a couple of weeks ago when I declined a drink. I never did the meetings and chips thing as it wasn't for me. I quit cold turkey and have maintained it. But there are always some who tell me that I'm a \"dry drunk\"--at this point I roll my eyes and say \"for 21 years? Guess I'm doing OK!\"  But what they think doesn't matter. I'm fine.", "I couldn't go for a while after I got sober. It doesn't bother me at all now.", "My father was an alcoholic,  and very much against religion,  AA is very spiritual based, so that wasn't an option. After having health issues and his 3rd dui, he quit cold turkey and hasn't had a drink in 15 years. That was how he decided he had to deal with it.  As far as I'm concerned, recognizing you have a problem and fixing the problem makes you a recovering alcoholic. You did nothing wrong. I'm glad you were able to turn things around.", "NTA. i\u2019m in a similar situation to you except i started drinking very heavily as a teacher. i did quit drinking entirely for years because i couldn\u2019t trust myself to stop. i don\u2019t say i\u2019m in recovery but i now have an extremely strict 2 drink max because i\u2019ve been known to finish a bottle and go back for more. recovery & healing are not linear, there\u2019s no script, and no one can dictate what it looks like for you when you\u2019ve acknowledged the problem and are actively working to fix it.", "Medically speaking an alcoholic is someone who has *physical dependency* on alcohol so from what you've said no, you're not an alcoholic but saying you are does convey how you feel about drinking.\n\nI know as I do it myself.  I've always been able to control whether I drink or not but once I have my first drink I don't stop until I'm wasted.  For that reason I stopped drinking alcohol 13 years ago.\n\nRather than explain all that I just tell people I'm a recovery alcoholic for ease of reference.\n\nGuy called you out on it in a needlessly aggressive way and you apologised.  NTA.", "NTA. I would just say \u201cI\u2019m not drinking or I don\u2019t drink \u201c in the future.\n\n1. You don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation or backstory for your choice not to drink.\n\n2. Like you encountered in this situation, when you say \u201calcoholic\u201d,  to a lot of people it insinuates certain struggles and issues that you\u2019ve been through as a result of your drinking. You may get random extreme reactions from people because they could see it as you mocking alcoholism. Not in a way to minimize your experiences, but for a lot  of people 3 awful life events in quick succession leading to heavy drinking for 6 months doesn\u2019t really constitute what people traditionally consider \u201calcoholism\u201d in some peoples eyes. So to people who have had more trauma related to alcoholism, addiction etc, in their families it could seem like more of an attention getting technique or almost mocking it as you can be around alcohol and even drink occasionally.", "NTA recovery comes in all different shapes and sizes. You should never feel bad for trying to better yourself and your life.", "You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't. It's almost laughable. You've given up booze for over 20 years and your effort still isn't good enough for some people. At this point, when I hear stories like this, I'm pretty convinced that people are just projecting their own addiction insecurities onto other people. Well done for what you've done, especially with no support, it's fucking awesome xxx", "Congratulations on getting sober!", "Thanks. It took quite a few tries, but it eventually stuck.", "Go on, it\u2019s your birthday, have some H, let your hair down, have some fun for once. \n\nNo, they don\u2019t. \n\nYou\u2019re right.", "Don\u2019t apologise for your passion. I might not drink but I still enjoy the history of it and the behavioural norms that surround it. I live on a tiny island in the Irish Sea. People on the adjacent Isle describe us as 80 000 alcoholics clinging to a rock! They\u2019re not far wrong. There\u2019s a lot of alcohol consumed here."]}
