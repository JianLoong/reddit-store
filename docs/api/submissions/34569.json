Obviously I said \"sure.\" Apparently the guys on his sports team are mad into \"manscaping.\" Supposedly the sight in their locker room is lots of buzz cuts and Mohawks south of the border. I said sure, of course, I personally don't get it but you do you, just don't get hair all over the bathroom.\n\nLater when wife found out she was a bit peeved as we had agreed to make \"parenting decisions\" together. WTF? Parenting decisions? We're just talking about some shaving/trimming below the equator. No big deal. She dropped it.\n\nLast night we had our best friends over. At some point during evening we were asked \"How's Erik and what's he up to?\" I laughed and said how times had changed that back in my day we couldn't wait to get chest hair and today they are all about being smooth and trimmed up downstairs. One of them said \"How so?\" I said \"Well are you familiar with Hitler's little moustache? That's what's happening down there.\" Cue the hysterics, they thought it was funny as hell.\n\nWife blushed and was NOT amused. She later chastised me for \"mortifying\" her and that the subject was not appropriate talk with guests. What? They are our absolute best friends and practically Erik's second parents. And I'm sure they are both familiar with pubes. We've talked about much worse and more personal things before.\n\nSo am I the asshole for embarrassing my wife?\n\nEDIT to fix paragraphs\n\nEDIT for more info per DM request:Erik will be 16 in two weeks.No, no one told the wife about trimming/shaving. Erik came in shirtless after running and she noticed his trail was gone.Yes he showed me, came in and whipped off his towel to show off his tonsorial efforts.  And yeah it's like a little Hitler moustache. Or maybe should say Charlie Chaplin.Only tip I gave him was not to completely shave down there.. unless he was a fan of itching.\n\nEDIT to add: Several ppl think I overstepped or violated Erik's privacy. I just now told him about our friend's conversation and he could not have cared less, in fact he thought the whole discussion was a hoot. He laughed out loud. If anything I think he might have been pleased to be a topic of conversation. Kids love validation. I doubt his pubes will be needing further discussion.", "created_utc": 1704683486, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191az47/aita_for_embarrassing_wife_about_sons_manscaping/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Boys think penises (and anything involving them) is funny and I could see how this would be silly / funny but I can also see it being inappropriate. It would never fly if this was your daughter. So there\u2019s a bit of a double standard. As a general rule, discussing a minor\u2019s genitals is a bad idea and I think the jokes should be left up to the kids to make instead of the adults making them on their behalf and at their expense. Also your wife should have no say in how her son decorates his crotch. Good on you for normalizing these conversations between you and him though! Not many kids can be this open with their parents, so you did something right! \n\nFinal vote - ESH", "Yta. Why are you making jokes about your sons  pubic hair ? I highly doubt he would be fine with you speaking on that matter. Would you want your wife to chime in saying stuff about your pubic hair to the friend group?  I don't understand why you thought it was ok to even mention this. \n\nIt's weird. Talking to him about shaving is fine. Talking to others about his body is not.   Do better.\n\nYou may have talked about personal things. But you don't get to talk about another person's body without their consent.", "Why is it obvious you would share a body hair trimmer with your son? Why not just buy him one if he expressed interest?", "NTA. Funny shit. Your wife should chill out.", "Yeah you are. No amount of familiarity with friends justifies talking to them about your teens' privates. YTA", "NTA. People are taking this wayyy too seriously. As a dad of two, one being 17, I\u2019ve definitely told \u201cawkward or funny\u201d things about my kids to friends. It\u2019s not that serious people. My guess, most responses are from kids themselves", "YTA\n\nDon't make jokes about your sons pubic hair. The fact that I even have to say this astonishes me.", "NTA\n\nAnd WTF is she on about parenting decisions? Body grooming is a PERSONAL decision. Not something a parent has any say on. Your wife is weird AF.", "YTA - this was not appropriate conversation for guests.", "What in HELL did I just read\n\nI\u2019m half way between laughter and throwing myself out a window\n\nI have to go with ESH, I have second hand embarrassment \n\nAnd yeah don\u2019t talk about others bout your sons junk, and wife probably shouldn\u2019t have called attention to it. ew", "YTA. You have absolutely no business discussing your son's genitals with ANYONE. None. Your son is entitled to his privacy. You violated that.", "NTA. I find it very weird your wife 1. Noticed the lack of pubic hair on your son and 2. Felt entitled to dictate what his grooming habits should be. Also she felt entitled to tell him what he can do with his body hair but then feels that it\u2019s inappropriate to make a joke about it with friends. \n\nHad your son been shy about this then I\u2019d say yes it shouldn\u2019t have mentioned it but the fact he\u2019s apparently open about it means that it\u2019s fair game in the right company. Also you made a joke not mentioning anything outright the friends asked for more info and you gave it.", "Esh. I didn't think I would have to say \"don't talk about your son's pubes\" but here we are. Your wife needs to butt out though. Let your son take care of himself however he like.", "ESH\n\nNot an appropriate story to be telling others. This isn't a discussion item with anyone unless he needs to go to the doctor for an infected ingrown hair or something.\n\nYour wife shouldn't be making decisions, nor should you, about your son's choice to manscape. Provide a trimmer and move on. He's old enough to get majority say in the hair he has to care for .", "YTA\n\nNot only for the fact that you made jokes at his expense, but for talking to others about his pubic region\u2026 that\u2019s a little weird!\n\nHow would he have felt if he was in the room?", "NTA and frankly funny as hell. Hitler mustache. Nice.\n\nI'm sure the boys think it makes them look bigger.\n\nMy boy (now 18) was that age when he first tamed the bush, did it when he had to shave for his swim team. He wasn't as eager to do it as Eric, he didn't care about armpits or legs but he was definitely sad to lose his happy trail.", "No body seems like an asshole here. The joke wasn't directed at her and you handled it well. However I personally would not share my trimmer with anybody. Don't care who it is that thing is mine. But a trimmer would be a good gift for him", "NTA\n\n  \nUnless your son is 11, this is NOT a parenting decission.", "Mostly YTA. I get your son seems chill about discussing it with you and that's a good thing, but not really an appropriate thing to raise with others even if they are close especially if you know your wife is a little sensitive about it.  Not a huge mess up but still, probably could ahve used more thought.", "NTA about giving manscaping info to your son without your wife's permission. It's not a big deal regarding your son's well being.\nYTA for telling friends. Just because your son was comfortable with you knowing, it doesn't mean he is comfortable about others knowing. Freaking weird AF talking about a MINOR'S pubes.", "This is a clear NTA and honestly good for you that you have the kind of relationship with your kid where he can come to you about this kind of thing. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an asshole move to make a joke especially since your son didn\u2019t even care. People need to chill out, this is hilarious to me", "You are not the asshole you are hilarious. \nYou sound like a great dad I\u2019d love to drink a beer with you. \n\nYou don\u2019t want your son to be the odd one out, and it\u2019s absolutely harmless and funny.", "YTA. What he's comfortable with or not is up to him, not you to share. Your wife was right to be mortified.", "Dude YTA don\u2019t talk about your 15 yo son\u2019s public hair with guests. That\u2019s creepy as hell.", "Need more context. \n\nIf you were previously aware that this would bother your partner, then Y T A. If she's normally fine with topics like this, then you couldn't have known it would upset her.", "YTA - Go tell your son what you did and if he thinks you\u2019re an a-hole because of it. I\u2019ll lay odds that he does, and will be highly embarrassed by what you did. Don\u2019t forget that the tables will be turned one day. How will you feel if he laughs that you shit your pants in the nursing home, if you still have all of your faculties, and if he comes to see you at all because you were an a-hole to him as a kid.", "So I'm gonna go with NAH only because this sounds exactly like my own family so I understand both points of view. My family is a combo of backgrounds because the parents are in their second marriage with stepkids from both sides. One side is really open and the other side is more private. So some people are really comfortable talking and joking about stuff that the other side can get squeamish about. Nobody is right or wrong, we all just have to be aware and considerate of the other person's comfort level, and be maybe a little more relaxed and good-humored about things that are a normal part of being a human with these sometimes ridiculous bodies", "YTA to your son!!!\n\nThat is WAY too personal to share without permission in advanced\n\nAnd yes, if your wife is uncomfortable with that kind of stuff being shared over dinner, respect her", "I am mortified for your son and your wife. Borderline creepy and inappropriate. YTA.", "Yta", "YTA \n\nThat's your sons information to share not yours.", "Your the asshole.  Not an ok subject to joke about.\n\nYour wife's an asshole too for thinking her son shaving his privates is a parenting decision.  It's your sons decision, especially at 15 almost 16.", "\"Thank goodness they asked about Erik first and not Janey...things would've gotten REALLY awkward when I pulled out the photos from the abortion.\"", "NTA.  This is hilarious.", "Some of these comments are dumbfounding. Ever been in a boys' locker room? Half of the talk is dick jokes.\n\nI think young people these days are just more comfortable in their own skin. When my boy was that age we never knew when we were going to come home to skinny dipping in the pool, with or without friends. I can't count the times I've passed by his bathroom, door open, and he's standing at the sink brushing his teeth as naked as the day he was born. And thinking nothing of it. I didn't know if that would change when he got older, but when home from college for Christmas I saw him walk through the house to the laundry room to get a towel without a stitch on... swingin' and not giving it a thought.\n\nNothing to get worked up over.", "YTA\n\nI have a son that would fit right in by putting himself on blast like that BUT it's his move to make. You shouldn't have told anyone. As he gets older and leans into discretion  he'll be less inclined to share such topics with you, fun or serious.\n\nI wouldn't be embarrassed of my son, I'd be embarrassed of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s so unfortunate that these boys literally see each others privates at school. I don\u2019t understand why they care about each others pubes like this.", "Thanks. Yeah I don't think Erik or his buddies see this as anything even remotely sexual in the least (and neither do I). They are just goofing and being silly. That's what they think and I do too.  And yes fortunately Erik is a terrific kid, completely open with me and will tell me anything and talk about anything. He was positively eager to flash his new \"haircut\" to me. I'm not sure if he was looking for shock, or approval, or both. I told him it looked good. What else could I say?", "You never know if he sticks with it.
