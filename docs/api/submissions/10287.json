If you leave out the fear of flying how selfish does it really sound?\n\nThis might even be her way of trying to persuade you to overcome this fear to try to share more experiences; the older you get the more rare they become.", "NTA \n\nAlthough as you both love the show maybe she genuinely thought you\u2019d like this rather than her just doing it for herself.\n\nJust tell her how you feel", "I\u2019m gonna say NAH. This may be wild speculation and I\u2019m giving her the benefit of the doubt since I don\u2019t know either of you, but I\u2019m guessing your wife\u2019s love language is quality time, meaning the way she understands, gives and wants to receive love is doing things together and being with each other for shared experiences. So she took something you both love (the shows) and wanted to make an experience for the two of you out of it. My wife is similar. You\u2019re not into the podcast and don\u2019t like flying, so it\u2019s something you\u2019re not into, and that\u2019s also ok. I don\u2019t think either of you are wrong. You should have a pretty frank conversation with her. I\u2019d stay away from \u201cyou did this for yourself\u201d arguments at first if you can avoid it and stick to \u201cI really appreciate the effort and the thought but instead of flying, which I\u2019m uncomfortable with, let\u2019s do something else\u201d kind of phrases. Good luck to you.", "NTA for howyou feel, but if you both watch the show don't assume your wife has done this with bad intention and you would be the AH if you went accusing her of that (but you can of course talk to her more sensitively)", "Dude give me the tickets I would love to meet the guys from IASIP\nassuming that\u2019s what it is", "YTA\n\nShe asked you if it would be OK, and you said yes.\n\nIt feels like you are making some judgments here before actually going through the experience.  How do you know you won't enjoy this?\n\nYou said you will probably be doing other things on the trip that you would enjoy. You like the show. You are focusing on one element of the trip, the podcast.", "NTA, I'm leaning towards saying that your wife has selfishly booked this for herself, even when knowing about your phobia, because she really wants to go. Even if she genuinely believes that you will enjoy this too, it's at least 50% because she wants to be there). \n\n----\n\nMy dude, totally unsolicited advice, and it has nothing to do with my vote, but I would really recommend working through the phobia for your general betterment, only because it can be a pretty restrictive phobia that will eventually get in the way of some reasonably big milestones. \n\nI'm not judging you at all, phobias are not in our control, nor are they things to be laughed at. But from the bottom of my heart, I hope you manage to work on getting less intimidated by the prospect of flying, because it can really hamper certain elements of life, and I would hate that it restricts you from doing something when you actually have to.", "NAH\n\nShe didn\u2019t hit the target this time, since you both love the main show she might have thought it would be something you would like.  Honestly imo just talk to her, she probably doesn\u2019t want to make you miserable and it might not be a comfortable conversation but you don\u2019t deserve to spend **your** birthday celebration doing something you don\u2019t want to.", "NTA. She wanted to surprise you, it failed. Next time, she should do more research, or just straight up ask what you want. I'd personally like that more instead of a surprise that has 50-50 chance of failing", "NTA this was for sure a gift for herself and if she knows how fearful you are of flying she\u2019s an AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would not plan a surprise trip, that would not be a gift to him. He does plan surprise trips for me, which is cool, I like to travel", "YTA", "I hadn't thought about it this way, thanks.", "That's the thing, it's really not in keeping with who she is as a person to have done this maliciously but I don't know where she would have gotten the idea I'd enjoy the podcast other than the fact we both love the show.\n\nI'm trying to think positively about it and tell myself I might turn out to really enjoy it.", "I'll admit my first thought was that she'd done it selfishly but that's really not who she is as a person and I think it's more been a misunderstanding. I'm trying to keep an open mind about the show and maybe we might do some other nice things together while away which will make the flight worth it.", "My first thought was it had to be Always Sunny.", "I'm certainly trying to work through it. I'm trying to push myself to fly more and gradually getting there. I did go see a Dr once to see if there was anything I could take to help with the anxiety while actually flying. They gave me diazepam but it didn't really help at all I felt.\n\nI had a really bad needle phobia when I was young that I worked through and now am a regular blood donor and arent bothered about needles at all so I'm trying to approach this the same way I did with that.", "I was terrified of flying most of my life I had been on a plane a couple times, but I hated it. Then I decided to go skydiving thinking that would help, my god that plane ride up with so terrifying that now regular Jets are like nothing. Seriously get on a Cessna for a minute, commercial flights will be nothing after that.", "I don\u2019t think this is necessarily it since it is on a show they like and I assume has some of the same staff.  I think she swung and missed and OP should say something rather than going with it but it doesn\u2019t seem obviously malicious.", "my guess is it\u2019s always sunny in philadelphia", "Also, is there a reason you have to fly? A one hour flight turns into a 3-4 hour trip by car, depending on traffic. It's also a whole lot cheaper in my experience.", "It\u2019s possible she thought you would enjoy the whole destination trip more than just the podcast itself, is it in a cool city or you guys can go do other stuff?\n\nNAH It doesn\u2019t sound like this is a gift for HER she is pretending is for you, it just sounds like you\u2019re not excited about it. And that\u2019s ok.", "I don't think that is that strange to think that people that love a show would like to go to a live event with the cast (and maybe get photos later with them?), even if they aren't interested in watching or listening to recordings.\n\nWatching a live event is a pretty different experience. Maybe she is mistaken about your interest, and she assumed your love for the show would make the live event special when you don't care, but I would give her the benefit of the doubt here that this isn't just a selfish gift, specially if you say she doesn't usually do that with your gifts.", "That's really great! You're really quite brave for working through these phobias, and just how you managed to get through the phobia of needles, you're gonna get through this too! I'm rooting for you!", "My mom is scared of flying and her Dr prescribed Xanax for her. Honestly, she rarely takes it, but knowing she has it if she needs it helps her anxiety a lot.", "That was the 1st thing that popped in my head.", "Yeah the place we're going is cool and we've been before. I'm just going to go with we'll probably do plenty other stuff together while there to make the flight worth it.", "Is a flight the only possible way for you to get there?  Would you be willing to drive for three or four hours instead?  Could you suggest that to her?"]}
