Does he just not ever go near water in case he starts feeling bad about his body? \n\nBut more importantly, this is a really big life event for you that will mark a new chapter in your life. The opportunity for higher paying jobs, more autonomy, new friends in higher positions. If he has shown some controlling behaviors before*, he might be realizing his window of opportunity to lock you down is closing.\n\n*controlling behaviors don't always look like slaming you up against a wall and demanding you change clothes. It can be more subtle like \"you're really wearing that?\" Or \"why would we do x thing that makes you happy when we can do y thing that we both like!\" Except you don't actually like y thing. It's usually easiest to tell by opening up your closet and really thinking about what's in there. How many outfits do you not wear when he's around? How many of your new clothes were bought because he would like it and I guess you think it's nice. Are there a few boxes with things you love but \"really he makes a point they're kind of childish or in bad taste\". \n\nNot 100% sure this is what's happening but I ***can*** guarantee you that a man who loves you and wants to see you happy, will not drive you to the point of crying and screaming in order to make sure he doesn't stand near water for 30 minutes.\n\n**just reread that you're both men.

It\u2019s perfectly fine to splash around the shallows", "The classic, let me make my personal problem your problem instead of actually addressing it and seeing a therapist. He is controlling. NTA", "NTA. This is your celebration and you should do it how you want to.  Bf can either come celebrate you on your big day or he can stay home and sulk.  Not everything is about him.", "NTA, he could at least be there to support you even if he doesn\u2019t want to swim.", "NTA\n\nYou're inviting people to bring something to go for a swim in - it's not compulsory and you've said as much.\n\nSomeone else being uncomfortable with their body in this situation means they either find a way to take part, or just don't bring one and don't go in the water. Simple.\n\n>I\u2019d rather not do it but my mother really wants to and I\u2019m too much of a people pleaser to not do it.\n\nThis does start to read a bit badly, so aware - you shouldn't be having a party that's stressing you out _and_ isn't what you really want - might be time to stand up for yourself here and after 6 years of toil have the self respect to do what _you_ want to do?", "NTA, you are not forcing anyone to swim or to get changed into swimwear.

You can\u2019t please everyone and this party is for YOU. Please have fun and do what you want.

First, you\u2019re right that in all likelihood not everyone is going to swim, many others will I\u2019m sure chill by the shore. Second, if it was me (I do love the water) I\u2019d find something I was comfortable in, like a swim shirt vs a bikini.", "That.   \nHe's not obliged to go in the water. He can stay on the shore.  \n\n\nOverreaction from the BF. NTA.", "I\u2019m also confused on why he can\u2019t just wear swim trunks and a shirt? Then nobody can see his body and he can still swim. \n\nIf anyone questions it, it\u2019s just an extra layer of sun protection. \n\nI still do this with a full swimsuit as a woman precisely for that reason. Nobody says you need to wear a Speedo or thong bikini. \n\nNTA\n\nEdit: Thinking over it some more, it seems really weird that there are so many different options to handle this, but the boyfriend is only open to \u201cI\u2019ll leave if you swim\u201d. \n\nOP, is your boyfriend extremely controlling in other situations as well? Is this what\u2019s building up some extra stress in the background on top of everything else you\u2019ve been going through with school? I\u2019ve been in a relationship like that before. They make you out to be the crazy emotional one when they\u2019re constantly making everything a struggle to make you break down.", "There are people who are comfortable with their bodies???\n\nI'm an old fat woman now and after my 2nd kid (and turning 30) I stopped giving a fuck if people looked at me in my suit at the beach or pool.  I also stopped trying to take pictures or videos of events and just enjoyed the happy moment for what it was.\n\nI'm still uncomfortable with my body, I still feel insecure in public in my swimsuit, but I will still push through my own shit to have a good time.", "Possible, ESH, OP's post seems to indicate that he insisted on a bathing suit, but I don't understand why he pushed so hard.\n\nThe correct phrasing is 'If you'd like to swim, remember your suit'.  OP's post seems to imply that he wasn't comfortable with BF showing up in jeans.\n\nNTA is correct if OP truly was not pushy, but unclear to me.  If BF didn't want anybody at all to go swimming just because he wasn't going to be in the water, then certainly NTA.", "Sometimes in a relationship we have to do things out of our comfort zone, and support our SO, he's not being supportive of you,,", "best comment here", "or even offer to look after everyone's valuables.", "I\u2019m 100% sure jealousy does not play a role here.

No, because I don't find shorts comfortable for various reasons.", "Exactly,  I've had three kids and am in my mid-40s. I'm on medications that make losing weight difficult,  so I focus on being/eating healthy rather than the numbers on the scale.  I try not to worry about how I look in a swimsuit, and as I always say, my hubby of 21 years is stuck with me.

BF said he was just going to leave the party if they swim, but OP wants him to stay at the party even if he doesn't swim.", "Is he jealous that you are having a party and he\u2019s no the center of it?

You don't have to celebrate it immediately a couple of months later is fine. Or celebrate when you get your first job in the field instead? I'm just saying if you're that stressed you need to take a hard look at what you've got on the table and remove everything that isn't a necessity. Often times there are at least tasks that can be delegated so you don't have to do it all alone.", "Yeah I\u2019m thinking about postponing it or cancelling it for good.
