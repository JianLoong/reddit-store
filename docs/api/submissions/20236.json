The opportunity for higher paying jobs, more autonomy, new friends in higher positions. If he has shown some controlling behaviors before*, he might be realizing his window of opportunity to lock you down is closing.\n\n*controlling behaviors don't always look like slaming you up against a wall and demanding you change clothes.

It's usually easiest to tell by opening up your closet and really thinking about what's in there. How many outfits do you not wear when he's around? How many of your new clothes were bought because he would like it and I guess you think it's nice. Are there a few boxes with things you love but \"really he makes a point they're kind of childish or in bad taste\". \n\nNot 100% sure this is what's happening but I ***can*** guarantee you that a man who loves you and wants to see you happy, will not drive you to the point of crying and screaming in order to make sure he doesn't stand near water for 30 minutes.\n\n**just reread that you're both men.

Maybe, insecurity that now that you are going to be a doctor, a prestigious profession, that you are going to move on to bigger and better things (including him)?", "And I quote: 'I told him it was unnecessary to leave because I don\u2019t think that everyone is going to bring their swimsuit and even if everybody does'\n\nAnd then: 'He was firm and he said I didn\u2019t take into account the fact that he\u2019s uncomfortable with his body and I replied that it\u2019s my party'\n\nThen she yells at him?!\n\nWe're not asking if he is an asshole. We are judging her actions.", "I had an ex that did this. In retrospect, it was classic manipulation and isolation so they could continue preying on me without other people interfering by providing a dose of perspective.", "Exactly. I'm a guy who has to wear a shirt at the beach for medical reasons(medicine makes me super sensitive to the sun, especially on my back and chest) and I usually wear a underarmor shirt or something like that. The OP told everyone to bring swimming attire which does not mean speedos and bikinis. It just means what you feel comfortable swimming in.", "They said \"after turning 30,\" so they may be a lot older than that. Who knows.", "My guy has put on some weight and is very insecure about it, it meant so much to me that he was willing to go swimming with my son and I. I think the thing that did it for him was me pointing out that our son just wants to play with his dad and wouldn't he rather play with his son than sit on a bench and miss out while the two of us splashed around and had fun? \n\nAnd like your friend pointed out, people who care about you want to have fun with you. They aren't there to judge you for not being a supermodel. And if someone is judging your body that's their problem and  they need to take a look at themselves and figure out why they think other people's bodies are any of their business.", ">  sometimes I have the feeling he\u2019s a bit controlling\n\nTrust your gut. Do you want to keep fighting for your party or opportunities such as Erasmus all the time?", "It\u2019s your party. If he can\u2019t tolerate not being catered to for 15 minutes of a day that is meant to celebrate you and your hard earned accomplishment, he\u2019s not your partner \u2014 he\u2019s the main character.", "Yeah, OP, I'm feeling like this is about him not wanting others to see you in your swimsuit, maybe. There's definitely control issues here - the situation is too inconsequential for him to be this upset about 15 minutes.", "Sounds like he's shaming you for wanting to do something and making you feel guilty. NTA - He is. He can stand on the shore and watch or stay home. It's your choice.", "The problem is, aside from invalidating his feelings, when boyfriend says he will leave if people are swimming she yells at him.\n\nHow hard is it to say ok, you can leave after the meal.\n\nIf he asks her to change her plans, than he is the asshole, but if he says 'i am so uncomfortable with a situation that I would rather leave' Fine let him leave, but he is obviously traumatized about his body.", "He can just leave. That's what he said he would do. If that's what he wants, why is anyone to stop him? \n\nHe's not said anything about stopping anyone from swimming!", "She\u2019s right. It\u2019s not dismissive to put someone back in reality especially when they are spiraling as it seems he is. His comfortability is Irrelevant when it\u2019s completely avoidable, and she\u2019s literally looking for ways to make him comfortable, while he refuses to. \n\nHe\u2019s dismissing her feelings by putting his own comfort (which has several solutions) above her literal celebration in which he would never have to BE uncomfortable if he would compromise. Explain how him going to the beach in his regular clothes would still make him uncomfortable with his body?\n\nHer compromise of him not even needing to get in the water because others most likely also won\u2019t is the opposite of dismissive, she is actively looking for solutions where he can be comfortable, what is he looking for? She acknowledges his feelings of discomfort, that\u2019s the opposite of what you\u2019re arguing \n\n\nHow would you have handled the situation? Your partner doesn\u2019t want to come to the event of celebration for one of your biggest life time achievements because of something avoidable. You give them solutions and compromise, they insist they\u2019d rather not come than compromise\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have yelled but she already apologized to him for that", "Perspective- not everything a woman does in her life is to try to be seductive for the male gaze. Especially when with friends and having a good time. \n\nKnowing when to keep your thoughts about sex away from women just going about their day though? That is priceless my dude.", "His feelings haven\u2019t been invalidated. They were validated and an alternative option was presented. \n\nYou could also say bf is invalidating gf\u2019s feelings by insisting he will leave the party if anyone goes to the beach. So, are they both invalidating each others feelings? A mature adult would not* see it that way. \n\nAlso, I know some people have been convinced that pushing against someone\u2019s feelings (\u201cinvalidating\u201d them) is wrong, but ya know what, some of the best growth I\u2019ve had as a person is when someone I loved pushed me to try something new when I said I was too scared to. It\u2019s possible that if he trust his gf enough to give it a shot that he would find the swim enjoyable and learn that literally no one cares what his body looks like because we are all too busy being self conscious of our own.", "He said he\u2019d rather leave if the party moves to the beach. Translation - if you want me at the party it better not move to the beach. How exactly is that not attempting to stop others from swimming?", "BF sounds like he is very inconsiderate and entitled.  He doesn't get a guest list to this event because he's not graduating med school.  YOU ARE.  This event is about YOU not him.  He can ask if he can invite someone and you are well within your rights to say no.  If he's insisting, pressuring, or otherwise making your life difficult about that he really isn't being a good partner to you. Reading your post and comments I do wonder if you really are happy in your relationship.  If not you aren't forced to remain in it.", "I'm not defending this guy's actions, but if he is not trying to get her to change her plans, then I can only imagine there is a sad story as to why he does not want to even be around people in bathing suits. SA, or any number of personal traumas, like a fear of the ocean.\n\nI don't read from this situation that this is a guy trying to ruin her party, but I haven't read all of her replies, so I probably have missed some context.", "Everyone had a right to say no in any social context. Saying you're uncomfortable and want to leave is a right. It applies to any gender. Regardless of what their relationship is, if a person says they want to leave that should be respected. Trying to force alternatives because you think is reasonable is not being respectful of where the other person's headspace is. Furthermore, the BF did not say no one can go. He only said he will leave.\n\nAlso, there's no she in this. OP is male.", "I find loose skirts to be cooler (in respect to temperature) than shorts. The fabric swishes around your legs when you walk, making your own breeze.", "100% this. A nice natural fiber skirt is my legwear of choice once the temperature climbs past 80\u00b0. People think I'm fancy or something. Nope, just like to be comfortable.", "That had more to do with how stressful this party was to plan and the BF was being a manipulative AH and making the stress worse.  Hes a walking red flag"]}
