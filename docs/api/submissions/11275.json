{"id": 11275, "submission_id": "11fy5mw", "title": "AITA for wanting my wife to only do one instead of two solo activities on our last vacation before we start a family?", "selftext": "\nMe (35) and my wife (30) have a 3 week international vacation planned together, that was supposed to be our last trip together before we try to start a family together and have kids. We\u2019ve always talked about how important it is to us to go and travel together and spend time 1:1 before we have the big responsibilities of parenting. \n\nMy wife wanted to get a facial skincare treatment on this trip that will take roughly 2.5+hrs. I was hoping we would spend the entire trip together doing activities together and would rather spend the time creating new core memories as part of our last hurrah before children, but I compromised and agreed to her self care time (she\u2019s always wanted to get a special skincare treatment abroad). I agreed to find my own solo activity while I wait for her, so I am going to get a massage before we meet back up for dinner. \n\nNow we\u2019ve been in an argument because she said that she now wants to also get her nails done, which will be another 3 hour treatment, which means I would need to find another thing to do solo while I wait for her for another 3 hours (on a different day). \n\nI\u2019m upset and feel hurt that she would rather get her nails done than spend that time doing an activity together. I feel that she is being selfish for wanting to do not one but two activities that would then force me to figure out what to do on my own in a country that doesn\u2019t speak English. The only thing I want to do is spend that time together doing a couple\u2019s activity to create lasting memories together. I did not want to go all the way to another country on this trip together to do things separately. \n\nI feel that agreeing to find something to do while she gets her skincare treatment done should be enough of a compromise, but she is insisting that she strongly that she wants to get the nail treatment. I\u2019d much rather be spending that time with her. I feel like I am being forced and left with no choice but to find something to do to fill the time in a country that doesn\u2019t speak english. \n\nWe are stuck in an argument about me being upset because I want to spend the time doing something with her, and she\u2019s upset because she wants the alone time doing self-care treatments. I feel like I\u2019m being forced to find things to do for the 5-6 hours when all I want to do is spend that time with her on the trip we planned together. I\u2019m sad and upset that I feel like she would rather spend the time alone than creating new memories together. She\u2019s unwilling to budge and insists she does both treatments or she\u2019ll resent me. I feel like I will resent her for not spending that time together.", "created_utc": 1677748156, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fy5mw/aita_for_wanting_my_wife_to_only_do_one_instead/", "score": 1747, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re in an entirely new country. Find something to do. It\u2019s extremely co-dependent to want to spend every single second of every day with someone. You can still make tons of lasting memories even if she just goes to get her nails done for a little while. \n\nShe probably wants to do it because you\u2019re smothering her. She just wants a couple hours to herself.\n\nEdit: autocorrect", "YTA\n\nYou sound exhausting. You can't handle being in your own company for a few hours while your wife gets her hair and nails done. You want to be glued at the hip. That sounds so draining and suffocating. It's healthy for couples to spend some time apart, 3 weeks doing everything together would be too much. \n\nYou can go sit in a cafeteria and people watch. Go to a museum. Look through architecture of the buildings around you. Read a book. Go swimming in the hotel pool. Go to a gym. Go to a spa. Go to a movie. There are tens of things you can do alone while your wife does her thing, and you don't need to know the local language to do them.", "YTA.\n\nIf you can't spend 5 hours without your wife, you need to find a therapist.", "Do you let her take a sh!t with the door closed without you?\n\nYTA. This is screaming so many codependent controlling toxic red flags. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nYour wife isn\u2019t being at all selfish. You are the selfish one. You have no right to control her every moment, and to guilt her for that is so incredibly manipulative and controlling.\n\nYou\u2019re going to resent your wife for getting one facial and a manicure on your holiday? You make it sound like you\u2019ve made some epic gesture by \u201ccompromising\u201d that she gets a facial. You\u2019re being \u201cforced\u201d to get a massage on your own? \n\nYou realise your wife will need some time to herself, *especially* before the baby comes?\n\nIt\u2019s healthy to spend some time on our own, to have our own interests and hobbies that are separate to our partners.", "YTA. If you can't spend 5 hours solo in a 3 week period without being upset at her I don't think you 2 are ready to have children. 3 solid weeks is a long time to be in the presence of another person forcing \"core memory\" making every moment of the day. I think it's great you want to spend time together. But you are not \"compromising\" by allowing her 2 solo hours out of roughly 500. Even the 5 hours she's asking for out of 500 isn't really a compromise. Your trip will be much more enjoyable if you're both able to do things you'd like to do while also spending a majority of time together. Otherwise the memories you create are not going to be the lovely experience you imagine them to be.", "YTA 3 weeks and you can't handle her being away from you for 6-8 hours?  Thats not normal at all and honestly I don't think your wife should have kids with you if you feel you are entitled to her every second.  There are plenty of thing you can do to occupy your time and distract yourself, you are a grown adult figure it out. \n\n\nWhat are you going to do when all her attention is on her newborn baby and not you?", "YTA. Go work out for a couple of hours while she\u2019s taking care of herself. From the title I thought she wanted to go on solo excursions. She wants to get a facial and have her nails done chill the fuck out.", "YTA and I wouldn't be surprised if your wife is finding these activities to do to get a break from you. 3 weeks of being joined at the hip to someone sounds mentally exhausting", "YTA. From my perspective it seems I\u2019d want to look my absolute best on my last trip before starting a family which would include treating myself to a facial & nails. She\u2019s about to have a bunch of restrictions on her body due to being pregnant & afterwards if she\u2019s breastfeeding. Her body is going to change forever in many ways & a lot of people mourn what they looked like before kids. \n\nHaving less than a whole day\u2019s worth of time for herself on a three week trip is nothing, especially since it seems like you\u2019re the type of guy to \u201chelp out\u201d with a baby instead of be an equal partner. I certainly hope she takes that time to herself & after she pops out kids you treat her to many more solo trips", "YTA\n\nToo many 'I want'. You don't think about what your wife-to-be wants.\n\nAlso, it's just 3+3 hours out of three weeks. You are not a toddler.", "She only wants 5 and a half hours out of 3 weeks? Yes, YTA.", "YTA and please get help. I don\u2019t mean that condescendingly, you honestly sound like you need serious help with your dependency if you can\u2019t bear to keep yourself busy for SIX HOURS on a holiday of THREE WEEKS. Also, it really doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re ready to have children. Wow. \n\nPlus, if you\u2019re so fixated on being in a country that doesn\u2019t have English as an official language, maybe learn some of their language in advance and learn about the culture. Most countries that are heavily relying on tourism offer plenty of activities in English but it sounds like you\u2019re not even aware that not everyone limits their horizon to their own language and culture.", "YTA. You sound tiresome. I totally understand why she wants some time away from you. If you can't spend a few hours entertaining yourself while on holiday, you're not emotionally mature enough to have children.", "Yta. She's about to start having kids! Let her get some time alone.", "YTA it\u2019s a 3 week trip. You\u2019re being unreasonable.", "YTA. Are u going to be this present when baby comes? Or is she going to be doing lots of it on her own?", "YTA - Two solo activities during a 3 week vacation is more than reasonable. And what kind of nail treatment lasts 3 hours?", "Wow. A whole country to explore, over three weeks, and you're jealous of her asking for six hours without you? YTA, and I worry about your possessiveness once a child is in the picture.", "So in the 504 hours you're away you begrudge her 5-6 hours by herself? YTA and this does not bode well for your relationship. Also, your tone about life now and life after children doesn't make it sound like you actually want kids.", "YTA and suffocating", "Are you mature enough to have children?\n\nEdit: YTA", "YTA. You are planning on getting pregnant not going to jail. You don't need to be glued to her now", "YTA I think we can all see why she needs the break and the treatments.", "YTA\n\nyou have 3 weeks together and are getting pissy over 2, 3 hour session apart. \n\nPart of being in a healthy couple is having some time alone...do you watch her poop too?", "Omg,grow up!!

Forcing \u201efun\u201c and \u201ecore memories\u201c doesn\u2018t work.", "YTA. Glad I\u2019m not the only one who thinks it\u2019s weird you can\u2019t do something on your own for 3 to 6 hours on a three week vacation. This should raise a flag to her", "YTA 3 weeks of time together and you can't give her 5 hours to herself", "5 hours out of 3 weeks is less than 1% of the trip. \n\nGet some perspective, yeah?", "Oh no. 2 things over two days totalling maybe 6 hours over the span of a 3 week trip. Doesn\u2019t that seem kind of silly to be upset about?", "YTA. When I read the title and the first paragraph, I assumed your wife had suggested splitting off for a week or more to see friends or pursue an individual interest or dream. The spit-take I did upon the reveal that you are complaining about half a day apart in total was epic.", "YTA. Are you always glued together like that?\n\nOut of three weeks, she wants 2.5 hours on one day, 3 hours on another day. That's it. You really can't find something to do on your own for a few hours, on vacation? \n\nGo to the pool, take a walk, read a book, nap, go to a bar and chat with some people over a beer. Do something on your own for a few hours. When you have kids and your social circle consists mostly of them and each other, you might be happy for a few memories that include neither.", "Let's say you're going from a Saturday to a Saturday. 3 weeks.  504 hours. You want to spent all of those hours with your wife.  All of them. You can't spare her 5-6 hours of that 504 for her to do something she wants to do. You also can't figure out what to do on your own for that 5-6 hours.  Are you absolutely sure you're ready to have children, because it sounds like you haven't got out of that part of life yourself yet.  \n\nYTA", "You sound like the kind of guy who plans every day down to the minute so you won't miss any \"memories\". Take it from someone who's been married for 35 years and travels everywhere with his wife. We don't have to be together for everything. If I want to golf, she'll get a spa treatment. If she wants to shop, I'll hang out in a bar and happily wait. \n\nThe very best travel memories, without fail, are the things that happen that you never planned or expected. I would really not want to have you as a travel companion. Loosen up and go with the flow, you have 3 whole weeks\n\nYTA", "YTA. I find it hard to read this and believe an actual adult wrote this and feels justified being sad and upset that his wife wants a few hours to herself. Do either of you work? How do you survive being separated most of the day? Why are you unable to entertain yourself for a few hours? Do you really think your wife will tolerate your nonsense much longer?", "Sir you are suffocating. It\u2019s THREE weeks, let her do some things she wants. It\u2019s always good for couples to have alone time EVEN in vacation, especially a TWENTY ONE day long one. YTA. \n\nAlso I do not think kids are for you guys, respectfully.", "YTA. Wait till you get zero time together when the kids show up. Let her have her time. Y'all about to have a complete mix up in your life. Enjoy it. Not many ppl can travel internationally ever. So figure it out. Stop arguing and enjoy it. Also maybe think about her wants..lots of your needs in this...", "So in 3 whole weeks you want to be glued together?", "Yta - you are upset she doesn\u2019t want to do exactly what you want and think she\u2019s the selfish one? \n\nSurely her happiness is important to you even when it\u2019s not exactly what you want?\nGo for a walk/swim/nap/read a book, you don\u2019t have to plan the exact same amount of activities", "YTA\n\n\nhear it from the mouth of a marriage veteran (married since 2005)\n\n\n1.) Forcing your wife to spend every minute of this time together with you is a recipe for disaster and will only cause resentment.\n\n\n2.) Spending all the time together without room for yourself now and then is not healthy for any relationship. Please remember that your wife is her own person with her own wants and needs. Wanting a skin treatment and her nails done is not even much to ask for. In some marriages, this stuff is routine.\n\n\n3.) Youre going on a 3 week trip abroad. She asked for about 5 hours for herself and you're making a big stink over it. Suck it up. It's 5 hours. Take a nap, go for a walk, get a coffee.\n\n\n4.) Most countries speak english. You may have to use your hands and feet to get your point across, but everyone knows what a \"coffee\" is. Seriously, do you live under a rock?", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s a three week vacation. I actually went back to double check. Three weeks and she wants 2,5 hours for herself on one day and then 3 on another out of three weeks. It\u2019s ridiculous.", "It's only like 5 hours. This is either really codependent or really controlling and neither of which are a good look for you. YTA", "YTA. She\u2019s going for a facial and a manicure. From your post title I thought she was doing something wildly exciting that you felt left out of. Your co-dependency is seriously unhealthy. Get a therapist and work on yourself before you add an innocent child into this.", "I had to scroll up again to reread because I am just baffled. Your vacation is 3 weeks and you can't get her 6 hours alone? Why are you suffocating her? I understand that this is your last big trip before kids but hold Moses Batman let the woman breath! Out of let's says 21 days let's take away two for travel take away one for her treatments still leaves you with 18 days with her. YTA!", "YTA. I totally understand you are disappointed because you wanted to spend 100% of your time with your wife and because things didn't turn out they way you had imagined. But I think you might have to be a bit more reasonable here. Three whole weeks with 100% 1:1-time is kind of a lot. It's kind of intense. It's understandable to want to take some time out. And 5-6 hours out of three weeks is very reasonable. That does not mean that your wife doesn't love you or want to be with you. That just means she has needs that aren't connected to you and that's OK. That's normal and most people have them. You still have lots of time to create memories. And there are lots of things to do in countries that doesn't speak English. Google is your friend! I'm sure you can find something you'll like! I know you'd rather spend that time with your wife but maybe use that time to think about why it feels so hard for you to spend a few hours alone? Maybe talk to your friends or family about it or possibly a therapist? Again, I feel that three weeks with 100% alone time with your wife is kind of excessive and your reaction is somewhat worrying. Your feelings are absolutely OK and valid, but I hope after you've acknowledged those feelings that you can move past them and try to handle the situation with grace. I'm sure you want your wife to be fulfilled and happy! Of course you want to be fulfilled and happy too. But only you are responsible for your own fulfilment and happiness. And I'm sure you are able to find other ways to fulfilment and happiness other than forcing someone to spend time with you when they don't want to. You can do it and I believe in you!", "This can't possibly be real.\n\nIn the first place, anyone who's ever been on aita must realize that claiming it's unfair and unbearable to be separated from his wife for a total 6 hours on a 3 week trip is going to end up with a whole bunch of strangers telling him YTA, using words like \"smothering,\" and \"dependent,\" and \"red flag,\" and \"controlling.\"\n\nAnd in the second place, maybe there are facials that take several hours, but a manicure?  Unless his wife is planning to have a tiny yet lifelike rendition of the Mona Lisa hand-painted on each nail, not bloody likely.\n\n(Or maybe, on the off chance this is real, the wife anticipates being so smothered that she's invented the 3 hour manicure to give herself a break from the enforced togetherness.)\n\nWell, if this is real, YTA.", "YTA. Not because you want to maximize time spent with your wife on your trip. Not even because you are being clingy. That\u2019s forgivable considering the upcoming changes in your life.\n\nBut your wife\u2019s desire to treat herself and spend a few hours to make herself feel beautiful and glamorous in a foreign place just before she surrenders her body and soul to the demands of pregnancy and baby is extremely reasonable. \n\nAlso, she may just realize that she will want some alone time, which is fair on such a long trip. She is going to to lose all alone-time for 9 months, and if she breastfeeds, she will be joined with baby all the time for another year or two. Meanwhile, you get to enjoy all the biological comforts and advantages of procreating as a man. \n\nLet her have this, stop being so insistent, compliment her profusely and sincerely after her treatments, and whatever you do don\u2019t sulk. Pro tip: maybe spend some of the alone time buying her flowers or something she likes.", "Look, my wife and I are very codependent, but this is nuts. You seem so concerned about what you\u2019re going to do. Read a book! \n\nI think what might be fair is asking her to be mindful of when she scheduled her appointments so they don\u2019t blow up a whole day each. But the woman is entitled to a few hours without you. This seems very controlling.", "Christ - this is absolutely pathetic. You\u2019re away for 3 wks and you\u2019re bitching about her having 5-6 hours without you? And you\u2019re whinging that this means she doesn\u2019t want to make core memories. You are way too immature to be having a child - your poor wife already has a child! You are too immature and codependent! What are you going to do when she\u2019s paying attention to the actual child? Complain? Whinge? Emotionally blackmail? Lord o mercy.", "YTA 3 weeks and you\u2019re stressing over 2.5 plus 3 hours? What do you do at home when you want to watch a movie but she is too tired? Guilt trip her and make her stay awake? Also, when the baby comes, you\u2019ll be taking shifts alone a LOT. She will be happier, more relaxed and have more fun with you after these vacation activities. If she wanted to spend two full days away I could understand, but 2.5 hours is time for you to browse a few stores and go for a walk.", "Yta. It\u2019s a 3 week vacation  she wants a couple of hours to get a facial and her nails done.  She is wanting to do something special to make not only herself feel beautiful but you get to see her in all her beauty.  \n\nUse the time to get a haircut and a professional shave at a barber shop maybe your nails done too not with her at the same time, go play a round of golf read a book by the pool, go snorkeling.  You are being way too clingy", "You sound exhausting! You do realize it's actually healthy to spend some time independently as well as together? It's 3 weeks and she wants to do two activities! That's barely anything. You need to seriously chill out.", "You can\u2019t entertain yourself for 5 hours in 3 weeks? YTA.", "YTA - She's already raising a kid, it seems. A very needy one. Please, you are abroad. If there isn't something that you can occupy yourself with for a few hours alone, you're obviously not travelling right.", "YTA\n\nYour expectation that you spend every moment of the three weeks doing things together is a bit clingy at best, and controlling at worst.  5.5 hours is nothing, and what would you do if she cancelled?  Spend those hours with her knowing she didn't want to be there and would rather be doing her thing?\n\nAt the end of the day, only doing couple activities is what you want to do.  Taking half a day out for self care is what she wants to do.  The difference between the two is so small that I'm surprised that you are bothered by it, and are setting out to ruin it for her with your attitude - as she will be sitting there for the 5.5 hours knowing you disapprove, and that will take away from the experience.  Let her be and enjoy the remaining 2 weeks and 6 and a half days together.", "YTA. Sounds like she already has a baby at home. Also, you're making it look like you can't wait to finally \"lock her down\". Man, give her some space. Might want to think about your dependency issues before you procreate.", "You said it was a trip you \"planned together\", so you should have a good idea of things to do in the city.  Instead of whining and arguing about a 3 hour gap in \"spending time together\", maybe you should just go explore.  I can't tell if you are just that dependent on her attention or she planned the vacation and you have no idea what to do.  Either way, YTA.", "YTA. Are you always this controlling?", "INFO: are you going for more than 2 days?

It's a holiday ffs relax.\n\n2 are you always this controlling and dramatic when you don't get your way? \n\n>my own in a country that doesn\u2019t speak English.\n\nThat sounds like a YOU problem. Start learning \n\n\n>I feel that agreeing to find something to do while she gets her skincare treatment done should be enough of a compromise \n\nWell considering what her body is about to endure, probably not. Pregnancy is brutal on a woman's body and quite often never the same after and she's possibly wanting to enjoy as much as her pre pregnancy body and life has too offer.\n\nRemember you said this was about enjoying yourselves BEFORE YOU HAVE KIDS. Ask her and YOURSELF what activities would you like to do together and alone at this location without kids or adults only. For a woman enjoying what she's going to just doesn't happen when you're a mum. \n\nI have an idea, let her get her nails done and spend that time organising something ridiculously romantic. She's going to have her nails done, be all gooey from her other appointment. Romantic dinner or wine tour, I'd suggest better but don't know your destination", "Omg so whiny and insecure. It's not activities! She's not doing any activities at all, she's doing the very basic self care for probably much lower prices!\nAlso, is she doing acrylic nails?

What will you do when there's an actual baby asking for your wife's attention?", "YTA - There are 504 hours in a 3 week holiday. Your wife is planning to spend up to 6 of those hours doing something solo, leaving 498 hours where she can be right by your side. \n\nYou are being clingy & controlling, and you sound like you don\u2019t have the ability to be on your own for even a short period of time. Maybe worth getting some help on that front, it\u2019s not healthy.", "YTA\n\nYou have 21 days and you're complaining about her getting spa/beauty treatments?\n\n  \nMate, you should be fussing over this woman - let her get all the fluff that she wants: manicure, pedicure, everything. her core memory is her wonderful spa day, your core memory is being able to pamper her. There HAS to be something that you'd like to do that she's not keen on like a golf driving range or similar that you could do. A cigar exhibition. Star Wars on an IMAX screen. Something.\n\nHow are you structuring the other 20 days? Is your itinerary being driven by you? I would suggest taking turn about in choosing activities so it's not all about you and you have a balance in what happens.\n\nScrew this up and she might change her mind.", "YTA, stay in the hotel room, watch a movie there or read a book or take a nice long bath. You're in your 30s and are gonna have a child soon, and this is what you're concerned with? My dude your wife will need lots more alone time when that baby comes.", "YTA mainly because you could get a mani pedi with her. It'll be relaxing for you, you'll get to spend time together, and your hands and fingernails will be so so smooth for the time you spend together \ud83d\ude09", "Info: from the way you are telling this story it sounds like both of you view being parents as a chore. You're going on your last vacation before having children gives off some last meal vibes. If you expect that you can never have any quality time with your wife ever again as soon as you have children (which is a valid assumption) why are you planning for children at all? You sound like someone that goes on a last walk before voluntarily cutting off his own legs for no reason.", "YTA. She doesn't need a baby, she already has you.", "YTA. 3 weeks together to make memories as a couple minus 5/6 hours to have some down time to yourself is still plenty of time together. You really think you'd resent her for taking an extra 3 hours to pamper herself? That is very extreme. You want to make time for each other as a couple and make memories before starting a famiy, I respect that. My partner and I ended up conceiving on birth control, and because of lockdowns and covid, we never got a babymoon or to travel and make more memories before the baby arrived. We would have loved our one week away we had planned before covid restrictions cancelled it. Three weeks is a long time, plenty of time for adventures and relaxing as couple. \n\nYou do realise that when you have a baby, the time you have as an individual drops massively? Like having a shower or bath by yourself without hearing a baby crying or a toddler screaming for you is a rare luxury. You don't think your wife deserves 6 hours to pamper herself and relax before carrying your child for 9 months? When you come home from work and she's been dealing with a newborn all day long are you going to resent her for wanting to have a bath and soak for half an hour instead or spending that time cuddled up watching a movie with you? It is all about balancing your time. She needs time as an individual as well as a mum and as a wife.

We\u2019ve always talked about how important it is to us to go and travel together and spend time 1:1 before we have the big responsibilities of parenting. \n\nMy wife wanted to get a facial skincare treatment on this trip that will take roughly 2.5+hrs. I was hoping we would spend the entire trip together doing activities together and would rather spend the time creating new core memories as part of our last hurrah before children, but I compromised and agreed to her self care time (she\u2019s always wanted to get a special skincare treatment abroad). I agreed to find my own solo activity while I wait for her, so I am going to get a massage before we meet back up for dinner. \n\nNow we\u2019ve been in an argument because she said that she now wants to also get her nails done, which will be another 3 hour treatment, which means I would need to find another thing to do solo while I wait for her for another 3 hours (on a different day). \n\nI\u2019m upset and feel hurt that she would rather get her nails done than spend that time doing an activity together. I feel that she is being selfish for wanting to do not one but two activities that would then force me to figure out what to do on my own in a country that doesn\u2019t speak English. The only thing I want to do is spend that time together doing a couple\u2019s activity to create lasting memories together. I did not want to go all the way to another country on this trip together to do things separately. \n\nI feel that agreeing to find something to do while she gets her skincare treatment done should be enough of a compromise, but she is insisting that she strongly that she wants to get the nail treatment. I\u2019d much rather be spending that time with her. I feel like I am being forced and left with no choice but to find something to do to fill the time in a country that doesn\u2019t speak english. \n\nWe are stuck in an argument about me being upset because I want to spend the time doing something with her, and she\u2019s upset because she wants the alone time doing self-care treatments. I feel like I\u2019m being forced to find things to do for the 5-6 hours when all I want to do is spend that time with her on the trip we planned together. I\u2019m sad and upset that I feel like she would rather spend the time alone than creating new memories together. She\u2019s unwilling to budge and insists she does both treatments or she\u2019ll resent me. I feel like I will resent her for not spending that time together.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Go and read a book at the pool, watch some tv in your room, take a walk and look at interesting buildings in the area, sit at a bar and talk to other tourists. Is it really as hard? In 3 weeks you will need breaks from time to time. And it is healthy to spend some time away from each other. You have something to talk about afterwards.", "I think OP is terrified that because the wife doesn't want to spend every second of every day with him making everything Special then she doesn't want to be with him at all and she doesn't love him the way he loves her - that or he's the sort of person who never arranges anything, just expects the other person to decide what to do and how to make that happen. Does the wife speak the local language or is that a special problem for OP? Phrasebooks exist - or you can type what you want to say into Google translate and it will read it out for you.

And you.  \n\nTell me where you're actually going and I'll help you make an itinerary.  If my wife wanted to spend a day feeding her feet to fish, getting massages and having her nails done I'd probably be glad to have the time to go get a tattoo or shoot some street photography or eat one of the maybe half-dozen things she doesn't enjoy eating as much as I do.  \n\nMarried people should spend some time apart.  Together and apart, my friend. \n\nMy buddy Mike went to India on a business trip with his wife and while she was working during the day, he hired a driver and went all over the place: he played pinball with migrant workers, bought vinyl records that had only ever been released in Asia, saw some Bollywood movies with his driver, who kindly sat in the dark explaining what was going on for him. In the evenings they are fancy meals and rolled around on clean hotel sheets.  \n\nMy wife and I live in Singapore.  I sleep with a C-PAP machine.  She wanted to do an overnight tour where she slept in a Dayak longhouse because she's really curious and invested in funerary practices of former head-hunting people in Borneo and Indonesia.  So she gets to go do that - we do the tours and tribal talks and art before the meal and ove night and then I spend the night in a hotel watching old Malaysian sitcoms on hotel teevee, drinking Bintang beer and enjoying my C-PAP while she legitimately enjoys sleeping in an un-airconditioned, no electricity head-hunter longhouse  with whip scorpions and really big ants.  \n\nIf we went to Vietnam tomorrow, there's a guy I'd go see about a tattoo.  If she didn't go for the tattoo too, there's a place she'd go for a spa day.  When we got back together, we'd eat crazy street food and maybe go into a colonial era movie theatre to see a couple of Audrey Hepburn movies with vietnamese subtitles.  \n\nGo do the shit.

Example, in Prague, he wanted to spend the whole morning in the spa section of the hotel, swimming and having a sauna, and generally relaxing.  I wanted to beat the crowds and visit Prague castle in the morning.  So we ate breakfast together, he went to the spa, I went to Prague castle and he met me there in the early afternoon.  Then we had lunch, and sightseeing together.\n\nYou are putting too much of the focus on being together all the time and not enough focus on making sure you both get what you want from this vacation and do things you enjoy.  You are individually planning to become parents, not just as a couple.  There may be days when she will really enjoy the memory of being able to have a leisurely manicure without a baby, just as much as she'll enjoy the sights you visited as a couple.", "YTA\n\nI'd go insane if somebody was attached to my hip for 3 weeks straight, no matter how much I loved them. I'd probably look for small get aways every few days. Your level of being upset about this is concerning. \n\nAlso: Why does it matter that the country isn't English speaking? Most touristy places have some level of English speaking options and the list of activities with zero requierements for any language is also pretty long. If you are really desperate and your wife just has less difficulties maneuvering these situations, ask for her support to organize something for you to do...but at least provide something you'd be interested in and just need help with arrangements.", "YTA. Is it an issue of being apart for LESS THAN SIX HOURS? Because if so, it would be in your best interest and the interest of your relationship to both ask yourself why and seek counseling for your codependency. \n\nIf it\u2019s because you can\u2019t stand the thought of her doing something without you for what amounts to a minuscule amount of time spent together on a 3 week trip (498.5 hours instead of 504 hours), you are a controlling AH, and my counseling point stands. \n\nMy imagination ends there. Why do you object so strenuously to solo activities??", "so youd rather argue and feel upset and hurt than let her get her nails done on vacation?\n\nDid it occur to you that she wants to look and feel her best for you?\n\nDid you really expect to be joined at the hip for the whole 3 weeks?\n\nTake a walk, take a nap, have a beer, read a book, watch a movie.

It's okay to do things separately sometimes, even during a vacation. \nAnd your life won't end just after that vacation.

If it bothers you so much to be in a country where English isn\u2019t spoken, why go there? Besides, it\u2019s stifling to be together so much on a trip.

Does she have to wake you up if she\u2019s up before you? \n\nYTA. And, frankly, ridiculous. In a healthy relationship people need alone time as well as together time. \n\nIf it\u2019s that much of an issue go for a facial and get your nails don", "YTA- it\u2019s a few hours during a THREE WEEK vacation.

Let\u2019s take some time thinking about how the two of you have different needs and different things about your life will change after kids. 5.5 hours out of a three week vacation is not much at all to ask. I think most people here agree that you\u2019re being selfish and controlling. Three hours A DAY wouldn\u2019t even be that big of a deal when compared to how long this vacation is.

Alternately, stop feeling you need to be joined at the hip - maybe she actually wants some time to herself.

Those are very enjoyable and relaxing, yes even for men.\n\nThough I highly recommend to let her have her alone time for a bit, as a mom to be in the (possibly near)  future she won't have any alone time for a very very long time to come as a parent.

You can go have life experiences, then when you reattach yourself to her hip you'll have something to talk about.", "Yeah like wtf? Why is he even going to that country if he finds it so hard that they \u201cdont speak English\u201d? Surely there must be something there that interests him? \n\nHeck, I usually go on a few scuba trips and my previous partners have never even commented on it. I would be gone for 4-5 hours and they were chilling by the pool when I came back (poor them! /s). \n\nThe wife isn\u2019t his mom and I would crumble if my partner needed this much attention.

I already commented and OP is an AH but your suggestions are valid and I thought of adding my own experience. My family lives in Europe and when we see each other we catch up. My husband understands the language but at some point, whenever he gets bored, he goes for a walk, will get a snack or some local deliciousness and then comes back after a couple of hours. He mentally recharges, does some exercise and sometimes makes new friends in the neighborhood.", "My husband got a ticket to an event out of state, but unfortunately was unable to get one for me.

This is a red flag now, but it\u2019s a divorce when you add an infant in.

Hell, some of the bigger ones you wouldn\u2019t even need to cross a border to feel like you\u2019re in a different country.

You may be 35 but you have some serious growing up to do before you have a family. \n\nAs a mother, I can tell you, you know what's really important when you're pregnant or have a baby? Self-care and alone time for mom, the person who is physically recovering and may be the baby's only food source.\n\nShe wants to get her nails and a facial done over a 3-week period!

Even if my wife wanted to do a full spa day on a 3 week vacation I would be completely fine with it. Go golfing, go to the gym, go on a pub crawl, read a book, go do some activity I know my wife wont be interested in.

This is such a drama over 6 hours of self care treatments. Why?? \n\nQuite honestly, if this is what it's like before a baby comes along, this isn't looking like a happy future for OPs wife.\n\nOP, once the baby arrives, your wife is going to have very little time for self care. To have you adding to this with your, frankly, dramatic response to her wanting a tiny bit of self-care is ludicrous. And off-putting.\n\n6 hours to herself in THREE WEEKS is not a lot. At all. The fact that you can't entertain yourself for 3 hours is ridiculous. Go for a walk, go to the gym, read, watch a few episodes of a show, listen to music or a podcast, get a pedicure... Anything. \n\nIf I were your wife, I'd have a lot of questions and concerns about having a baby with you due to this argument.\n\nYou're too demanding of your wife's time.

OP, YTA. \n\nA few hours across two days of a 3-week vacation is a very small amount of time.

It's like he thinks that in the absence of his wife, he should at least be able to talk to other people as compensation (but can't, because they apparently don't speak English). \n\nAnd because he can't even talk to other people (during a few hours of not being able to interact with his wife), that makes her decision even more 'cruel'. Dude seems unable to comprehend, you can do your OWN activities, WITHOUT having to interact with other people. You don't constantly have to be with other people. \n\nAnd indeed, how have they been working out activities in a country 'that doesn't speak English', prior to this? Has he relied entirely on his wife to pick/organise ALL of their 'couple's activities'? If so, it again demonstrates his inability to function as an independent adult, without the help/input of other people. He really seems to lack his own sense of identity - and like a lot of people lacking identity, he has an extreme emotional dependence on other people.

OP, is NOT ready to be a parent if this is how he reacts to a reasonable request. Yikes!", "I personally hate the phrase 'making memories'. Sure, it's nice to have valuable memories. But for some people, it's way overused - and there seems something very 'enforced' about it. They seem to want to 'manufacture' memories, as the main priority of an activity (for 'recall', at some undetermined point of time in the future). \n\nIt seems to reflect an extreme FOMO for those people, rather than real, spontaneous enjoyment of an activity. Aren't you supposed to be enjoying the activity for the here-and-now (instead of just focusing on what it'll mean to you, in the future)? THOSE are the best memories - rather than trying to organise the manufacture of 'memories', like a blinkin' military operation.\n\nOP will not die, if he only has 'couple's memories' from 98.22% of their waking hours on this holiday (yes, I did the math), rather than 100% of the time. And again, he's enforcing 'memories' on her (rather than those memories being genuinely enjoyable for her). \n\nShe wants to indulge her own genuine interests a little, and have some natural 'alone time' - rather than be suffocated into doing yet another activity with him, which she prefers less to the beauty treatments. Which 'memory' does OP seriously think she'd enjoy more?!", "If this was a weekend trip where they were supposed to do some fun activities together I could see being annoyed that he was being left on his own for a fair chunk of it. Then he complains about a few hours in 3 weeks?!?", "Honestly I\u2019d find this level of needy whining so unattractive.", "Now factor in that they plan on inserting a literal infant into this relationship.  This dude needs a serious codependent reality check or he\u2019s about to be divorced.", "It's nice to do things together on a holiday but it's also nice to just split up for a bit and do some seperate activities.

He is NOT ready for that.", "He's lucky if she comes back at all. If I were her I'd be running for the hills, he's exhausting.", "Y'all haven't had a full set in a while eh?

It's endless arguments to force her to give up on what she wants out of exhaustion. If she does go, it will be constant texts and calls to ask her \"important questions\". If she doesn't respond, he will be enraged. If she does, she'll be unable to relax because she must respond to his every prompt. Either way, she will be punished for doing what she wants and will be less likely to do it next time.\n\nAbuse stems from insecurity. It's a deep self loathing that the abuser externalities and tries to control by controlling the person. It's fear that if she's able to breathe at all, she'll realize he's not worth it or find someone better. It's fear that the victim is trying to trick and manipulate the abuser because the abuser operates that way and cannot comprehend authenticity. It's wrapped in \"I just care so much\" because that's not entirely untrue, but forcing another person to be your sole source of self worth is not normal and will always end badly. That can only come from within, and abusers see the continuance of their insecurity as a failure on the behalf of the victim, often worthy of retaliation or punishment.
