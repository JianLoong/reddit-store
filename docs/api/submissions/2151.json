Kinda sus to be honest.\n\nBut no matter how your ex actually found out, if they were making you feel bad about yourself and then broke up with you go ahead and message whoever you like. There's no timeline for how soon you can text, date, or hookup with new people.", "NTA! I freaking hate it when girls play stupid games like that. You deserve to be happy, she will never be able to do that for you. Block them both and move on to better things.", "NTA\nAnd don't even think about getting back with her. She's toxic.\nHave fun meeting other people and maybe find the \"right one\".\n\nOh..and screw around as much as you like until then ;)", "NTA,\n\nHow did that girl know your ex??? And why is it any of her business on how you move on??", "NTA King- you shouldn\u2019t ever doubt yourself and it seems like she unwittingly showed you her flaming ship that\u2019s ablaze and tossed you off with a raft- but no sharks roam the waters friend. Weird way of saying you dodged a bullet and I know someone would appreciate you- also Dating apps are cancer do not get sucked into it and mutated by their evil ways", "NTA some people move on faster than others. That\u2019s just toxic behavior on her part. You never tear down someone you love like that.", "NTA. Your ex has no right to complain about how soon you start looking for new friends. None of her business.  Don\u2019t play her game and just move on. It\u2019s sorta weird that girl you DM\u2019s emailed your ex but maybe she suspected you were trying to cheat on a longtime girlfriend and thought she was standing up for fidelity or something.", "She's sounds manipulative bro, you dodged a bullet imagine if you had a kid with her.", "Info\n\nI'm a bit confused.

Hurts to know your ex might be intimate with someone else, but y'know, a breakup is (usually) saying \"we no longer owe each other exclusivity with our intimacy\".", "NTA.

You broke up, she was verbally abusing you, and she told you she wasn't attracted to you. What you do now is absolutely none of her business. \n\nShe's just mad that you're not begging her to come back, and she's trying to manipulate you. Do yourself a favor and block her every way you can and don't look back.", "NTA She is trying to manipulate you by gatekeeping your feelings. \n\nStay away from your ex for your own sanity.", "NTA enjoy single hood!", "NTA. It sounds like she still wants you to change to match what she wants. That's very unhealthy though and you're better off just cutting ties completely.", "NTA.
