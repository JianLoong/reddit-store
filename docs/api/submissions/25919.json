I(18f) and my sister(26f we will call her bell) didn\u2019t have the best childhood growing up, My mom would often hit us, make us watch her kids, clean the house for her, would get into physical fights with her boyfriends up until I turned 13. During that time we found out that our mom had started using again. I was told on accident and it went downhill from there (moral of the story mom flatlined and they were trying to hid the fact she was in a coma from me). Around 2018 my mom was sobering up. I moved back in with her near the end of 2021, now your probably wondering why I\u2019m explaining my childhood trauma. For the past 3 years my mom has been trying everything to be a better person. She doesn\u2019t hit us anymore, but every couple months we will get in a bad argument where everyone has to take there space, so my sister bell doesn\u2019t think my mom is working hard enough to fix those problems. And initially I didn\u2019t want to get involved, she started sending my mom books like Jennette McCurdy\u2018s trying to claim my mom enforced eating disorders and other things onto us. Then she claimed my mom beat the autism out of her, which I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s physically possible, and then she started claiming my mom hadn\u2019t changed a bit from her past. We were on the phone one day discussing it and she tried getting me to openly side with her, I told her I don\u2019t think what she\u2019s saying is true and I do think that our mom has changed, she didn\u2019t like my answer and proceeded to yell at me through the phone for not agreeing with her, I hung up and she texted me telling me that my mother was the devil, and that we had not seen how evil she can be. But it\u2019s not like my mom hasn\u2019t been trying to work out these problems and offered to go to therapy with her. After I got that message, I was upset, and so I responded and the only way I knew with anger. She has one child who is currently living with his dad, she broke up with the dad, because she didn\u2019t want to be with him, but lied to him, claiming she was gay to get out of the relationship. So I told her to quit faking being gay and go find out where her child is. I don\u2019t think she has a right to comment on how my mom parents if she hasn\u2019t been there in three years, and she currently isn\u2019t even taking care of her own child. After that, I blocked her and didn\u2019t speak to her at all up until my 18th birthday party when I was talking to a family member about what had happened. And my aunt stands up from across the room and screams at me \u201cshame on you\u201d and sticks her finger in my face. I got a call later that day of her screaming at me, claiming that I was starting rumors and calling her names. I\u2019ve tried to be civil and talk to her about it, but I don\u2019t know what else to do.

You're in a tough spot. Your sister has no right to make living with your mom even harder for you than it has to -- especially when due to her age, she is clearly more in a position to be elsewhere. Sure, it was childish of you to bring that story up when you were angry, but -- and this is important: When you grow up with a mom like that, you do not learn to set boundaries. These kinds of moms don't let you. That's a hard thing to live with, because it means this kind of stuff happens (or much worse). You can't find a good way to tell your sister to stop what she is doing and why, and in the end, in order to make her stop and respect your boundaries, you overreact or get mean etc. \n\nAlso... while your sister sounds like she has issues (how could she not?) she is also not wrong. You do not owe your mom for the fact that is getting better now; you do not have to protect her or her feelings and you do not have to take care of her. It sounds like the best thing for you would be to find a way to have your own life as soon as possible. And once you can afford it, work on this stuff with a therapist. Boundaries can be learned, and you are still young.", "Ok. That was a lot of trauma. Your sister is traumatised. She probably doesn\u2019t want to inflict what your mother has inflicted to both of you and your siblings to her child. Obviously you and her weren\u2019t educated well on how to handle ending a relationship so she lied, like a child. You overreacted and blamed her. That\u2019s not right. YTA you should apologise. Like right now. Unblock her. Call her. She\u2019s not your enemy in this messy family you have. She\u2019s trying to heal herself and protect you. You should be thanking her.", "This is above reddits pay grade. Please seek therapy.", "NTA. You should try to clarify things with your sister.

It\u2019s just hard. My mom has changed a lot and I\u2019m not saying that I hate my sister for cutting her off, she\u2019s been alive a lot longer than I have.

It\u2019s pretty simple.", "You hurt her with your words and actions more than just by siding with your mom. You cut her off first by saying she should reveal her lie to her ex and raise a child she\u2019s afraid to hurt. I don\u2019t blame her for not wanting to speak to you right now. And you should not have talked about all this with your aunt or anyone. That\u2019s your sister\u2019s business she confided in you. You were not a good sister or friend. It\u2019s just karma.

That\u2019s what your mom is - a child abuser. You literally said in the post that your mom physically (hit you) and emotionally abused you until you turned 13 - so she would have been 19. So she had almost 20 years of your mom beating on her.\n\nIf your abusive mother is your safe space I feel super sorry for you."]}
