{"id": 11084, "submission_id": "11dncle", "title": "AITA for not being home to celebrate my daughter's 19th birthday?", "selftext": "My daughter Ana turned 19 last week, and I wasn't home for it. Ana has hated birthdays for pretty much ever, I think my husband influenced it because he hates celebrations/anything that makes routine shift. So for her entire life, Ana pretty much just likes to be sad in her room on her birthdays if I'm being honest.\n\nThis past year, while Ana was away at university for her first year, she developed what I thought was really bad anxiety. She kept going to hospital and I was pretty fed up with all the phone calls I kept getting, but horrifically, it turns out that Ana actually has a cardiac issue that requires her to take pills twice daily for the rest of her life + frequent checkups, etc. Nothing deadly, but life changing.\n\nThis matters for her birthday because apparently Ana thought that maybe we would celebrate her birthday more this year because she \"survived something big\". Ana has been pretty sick before in childhood and knew from then that illness doesn't make my husband more open to celebrating, but I digress.\n\nOver her birthday, I had accidentally planned to go to the family cottage with her sister and my nieces. The cottage is remote and has no cell service, so it wouldn't be safe for someone like Ana who is still recovering and needs to be close to a hospital. The vacation was about a week and a half, and Ana would be at home with her father the entire time, so she wouldn't be alone.\n\nAna was gutted when she found out, and only said \"you'll be missing my birthday\". But my nieces were travelling 6 hours to come to the cottage so I couldn't cancel, so I told her basically that if she's always hated her birthdays, how was I magically supposed to know that THIS birthday was the special one we were supposed to jump up and down and celebrate over?\n\nAnyways, went to the cottage with everyone and Ana stayed at home which was safest, but when we got back recently Ana was very upset and said her dad treated her very unkindly the entire time, and she cried so much on her birthday that her \"throat bleed\". I don't know what I was supposed to do to fix this - I could not cancel a week and a half long trip for my adult daughter's BIRTHDAY which she has NEVER cared about before. AITA here for being logical with what was within my control??? Was Ana in the wrong for not communicating herself clearly?", "created_utc": 1677533086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11dncle/aita_for_not_being_home_to_celebrate_my_daughters/", "score": 318, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ana has hated birthdays for pretty much ever, I think my husband influenced it because he hates celebrations/anything that makes routine shift. So for her entire life, Ana pretty much just likes to be sad in her room on her birthdays if I'm being honest.\n\nThis past year, while Ana was away at university for her first year, she developed what I thought was really bad anxiety. She kept going to hospital and I was pretty fed up with all the phone calls I kept getting, but horrifically, it turns out that Ana actually has a cardiac issue that requires her to take pills twice daily for the rest of her life + frequent checkups, etc. Nothing deadly, but life changing.\n\nThis matters for her birthday because apparently Ana thought that maybe we would celebrate her birthday more this year because she \"survived something big\". Ana has been pretty sick before in childhood and knew from then that illness doesn't make my husband more open to celebrating, but I digress.\n\nOver her birthday, I had accidentally planned to go to the family cottage with her sister and my nieces. The cottage is remote and has no cell service, so it wouldn't be safe for someone like Ana who is still recovering and needs to be close to a hospital. The vacation was about a week and a half, and Ana would be at home with her father the entire time, so she wouldn't be alone.\n\nAna was gutted when she found out, and only said \"you'll be missing my birthday\". But my nieces were travelling 6 hours to come to the cottage so I couldn't cancel, so I told her basically that if she's always hated her birthdays, how was I magically supposed to know that THIS birthday was the special one we were supposed to jump up and down and celebrate over?\n\nAnyways, went to the cottage with everyone and Ana stayed at home which was safest, but when we got back recently Ana was very upset and said her dad treated her very unkindly the entire time, and she cried so much on her birthday that her \"throat bleed\". I don't know what I was supposed to do to fix this - I could not cancel a week and a half long trip for my adult daughter's BIRTHDAY which she has NEVER cared about before. AITA here for being logical with what was within my control??? Was Ana in the wrong for not communicating herself clearly?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
