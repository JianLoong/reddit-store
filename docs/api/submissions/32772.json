My dad was poor and wasn't doing particularly well in life. He couldn't bear to see her earning more than him so, he went and complained to my grandparents. Then, my grandparents told her that they'd take care of me if she decided to accept.\n\nMy mom made the decision to stay here. I never really saw her until I was in my 5th grade, my grandparents took me away from them for obvious reasons. I never really felt the presence of my family, my grandparents have done everything for me from raising me to paying for everything I ever needed in life.\n\nMy dad used to hesitate to buy me even a pen. My dad lost his job and now they barely make enough to eat every month, I live very lavishly thanks to my grandparents, they did very well for themselves. I stopped my grandfather from helping them out financially as I'm in complete control of their finances and my parents eventually found out.\n\nMy dad scolded my mom and she confronted me about it. I just told her that if she accepted that offer, she could've raised me with her own pride and that I wasn't going to let a bunch of losers take my grandfather's hard earned money. Completely fractured me from them. Lot of relatives came over asking me to apologise.

Were you being neglected or abused? Were they only willing to help if she gave up custody, and if so, were there any justifications besides financial? Why were they allowed to simply take someone else's child? \n\n>They did everything they possibly could to make me feel comfortable but, they failed. I still don't care for them though.\n\nSo you decided that because your mother and father wanted to raise you more than they wanted money, and it ended badly when they ended up without enough money, you consider them losers?

I\u2019m confused.", "Agreed I was so confused", "1. She stayed behind so that my father wouldn't rage. 100% sure, my dad's parents told me that. When I refer to my grandparents here, I refer to my mom's parents. My parents and my grandparents live in different cities. \n\n2. As far as I was made aware, I was constantly being neglected as my dad was always working and he made my mom work for a few years here for a lower wage as well. I was just a baby, and the landlord of my parents' rented property called the police on them after an incident I don't want to mention. Grandpa took me away until they were ready to raise me properly, my parents did not object then but, eventually around my 5th grade took me back. \n\n3. My father was a miser. He put me in a roadside school, never paying much attention to me. I lived with my parents until my 12th grade. 7 years or so. Sometimes I had to beg him for days to get me basic stationary at which point I would just end up calling my grandpa. My mother was just a silent observer to everything. I'll tell you an incident. My father told me that it'll be very hard for him to pay for a decent private university that I was accepted for and would instead join me in a local polytechnic. I was one of my junior college's best students. Guess who I had to call? My father was wayyy too prideful to ask for their help directly. It's very hard for me to look at their intentions when all that did was drag me down. My mother was a bright student, from all her records possibly the brightest in my whole family. I hate her for making such a decision. You make it seem like money doesn't matter but, it absolutely does. Isn't it bad enough that my grandfather had to pay for my education instead of them? Now they want him to pay for their living expenses as well?\n\nAlso, I'm not from a western country. Family dynamics and marriages work very very VERY differently here. The marriage was arranged, she was forced into it, which my grandparents soon came to regret. I understand if it doesn't make any sense.", "If it was my money, as their biological son I would've done whatever I could to support them. It's not my money. I need them to know my grandfather isn't a piggy bank they can reach out for money whenever.\n\nAlso I don't know what you're saying? Food stamps? Unemployment benefits? You guys get benefits when unemployed???? I'm not from the States if that's what you assumed.", "Sounds to me like your grandparents saddled your mom with a loser and ruined her life. Your abuse seems like collateral damage from a decision they made. It's difficult for me to blame your mom for placating him giving how much blow back and misogyny tends to be present in places that still do arranged marriages. Your dad is an asshole but it's hard for me to blame your mom with the info given.", "ESH\n\nYeah, you\u2019re an asshole here. Even based in your own story your mom stayed BECAUSE your grandparents threatened to take you if she accepted a job that paid more than their son was making.\n\nThen they took you anyway.\n\nSounds like your mother was in an abusive relationship with your grandparents enabling it, using you as leverage. And how was she ever supposed to care for you when your father made sure to sabotage her chances at a decent paying job because of his own ego?\n\nHow much are you punishing your mom for a choice she didn\u2019t really have?", "damn like father like son. esh here except your mum, especially her parents and your dad.", "This just seems like a lot of nonsense.", "live very lavishly thanks to my grandparents, they did very well for themselves.
