That isn\u2019t counting any wipes, powders, ointments, etc.", "Of course no one needs to but if that\u2019s the standard to be for her friend, then good on her. Better than deciding to have a child with no means to support. Not saying that\u2019s OP but children would be a lot better off if people actually thought about these things before going ahead with a commitment for 18 years", "Come on, anyone with an ounce of sense can figure out it\u2019s rude to say \u2018it would be irresponsible for me to have a child if I can\u2019t afford private school and a house for them when they graduate\u2019 in front of people who want kids and will never be able to afford any of that. OP is also failing to notice her friend is clearly trying to cope with the real reason she isn\u2019t having kids, so they both suck. But her friend could also phrase things as, for instance \u2018I realized I didn\u2019t want to sacrifice my lifestyle and that we can\u2019t afford the kind of things *we* would want for our child if he had one\u2019 instead of the obnoxious way she did.", "i was referring to the bottom, op literally said \u201cshe literally said i\u2019m being irresponsible\u201d what i said still stands. neither one of them are inherently wrong. You don\u2019t need to be able to buy a child a house in order to have a baby. But if you want to that\u2019s cool too.", "Sorry, which country is this?", "Have you ever googled the cost of giving birth in an american hospital? Its like 15 to 30k! Even then insurance doesnt cover everything and you still have a few thousand out of pocket to pay. Let her live her life. Im glad it didnt bankrupt you... but in other places it can be expensive. I dont even have a kid and i pay over 2k (usd) a year for school taxes.... i pay for a school my non exsistent kids dont go to.", "I really don\u2019t understand where OP is getting the idea that kids aren\u2019t expensive. They are probably the most expensive decision an adult will make in their lifetime.", ">But isn't she, when she literally said I'm being irresponsible?\n\n~~This is the bottom line of the original post, she kinda is telling OP what to do, maybe not~~ *~~directly~~* ~~\"OP,~~ *~~you~~* ~~need to have xyz\", but in a way \"OP, you are irresponsible bringing a kid into your life. If it were~~ *~~me~~*~~- list of 'preferences'\".~~\n\nAfter reading OPs replies, I take this back, OP definitely just made this up in her head that the friend was talking about her.", "Op definitely is projecting. Just saying that technically kids dont cost as much as the friend is saying. Sounds like friend is saying certain things are needed however it isnt. She just wants that type of lifestyle for her future children.", "I have a child. She\u2019s 5. Diapers ran me $30-$40 a month. Kirkland formula from Costco saved me a ton of money and cost $17.99 every  8-10 days. I used to buy clothing lots off of marketplace every 3-4 months for $50-$60.", "Not a chance.", "College is not a mandatory expense and neither are braces. Daycare does suck, I never disputed that. I\u2019m just saying the diapers and food point was very hyperbolic.", "Agreed. $50x12=600 so not \u201cthousands\u201d.", "Actually I'd like an answer from OP if Anna actually said she was irresponsible directly to her.", "Hungary, it's in Central Europe. A lot of things are shitty here, but the gov desperately wants more children.", "You know it's the US who is weird on that one right?? Most developed country don't charge you up to 30k to give irth....", "American here.  Paid 200 copay for having a 5 day stay for a c section and no co pay costs for all maternity visits when pregnant", "It's one level of self absorption to filter everything as if it pertains to you, it's another to then convince yourself other parties intended that. \n\nOP doesn't own the topic of childbearing. Her friend can have her own views pertaining to her experience and life choices and is allowed to elaborate when prompted.", "Formula (assuming no breast feeding) is another easy $70 a month.\n\nThe poster also had it in the same line as added insurance premiums. But even without the insurance\u2026..\n\nThat poster was not incorrect. Formula and changing diapers costs in the thousands in the first year alone of having a child. I\u2019d budget $2,000 and hope you don\u2019t go over. Any diaper or food sensitivities, and that $2k is too low.", "i agree", "She didn't say \"Hey, OP, you are irresponsible\". She said \"It's irresponsible to have a child when you can't provide private schooling, a house when they grow up, etc to them.\" \nShe said it like it's a fact.", "You have really good insurance. Some people give birth without insurance.", "That is unbelievably good.  I don't know one person who paid that little.", "Y'know, I wrote that before reading any of OPs replies and now I don't believe the friend ever said or even implied that OP was irresponsible, OP definitely convinced herself the friend was talking about her."]}
