None of it was about you. \n\n>At first I just told her that babies don't cost that much\n\nYes. Yes it does.\n\nBefore having a baby can be costly. Maternity clothes, prenatal vitamins, diet changes, pregnancy side effects/illnesses, etc. You can stay for weeks in the hospital if you're sick enough. Every single illness you could get could potentially hurt the fetus. Hospital bills add up and you can lose pay for missing work. \n\nJust *having* a baby at a hospital is expensive. I believe Forbes said somewhere it was near $20K on average in the US before insurance. That might include epidurals, delivery, etc. That doesn't include if there's any complications that might result in emergency C-sections, NICU, etc. \n\nNot to mention diapers, formula (even if you plan to breast feed, you will likely need some if you can't produce enough/not nutritious enough), clothes, stroller, cribe, and car seat that you'll need when the baby is born.\n\nOnce the baby is born, the mom is at risk for *other* health complications --not just PPD and PPA. That can last her entire life. And, again, hospitals are expensive.\n\nThen, you have to calculate childcare. Is one parent staying home with the kid? That's one salary gone. Is the kid going to daycare? How many hours a week? That adds up quickly. If you have a WFH job where you can watch the baby, or have a relative willing to help, then you're lucky. Not many people are. Until the kid is old enough for school, most parents will pay something in childcare for (a conservative estimate) four years. \n\nThen... school supplies, clothes, toys, anything for extracurriculars, lunch money for 12+ years. That adds up. According to the WashingtonPost, about $310K total from birth to 18. \n\nThat doesn't include cars, cell phone, college, etc.\n\n>They go on some many vacations and even just going on one less per year would cover for a baby's expenses.\n\nUnless your friend is taking vacations that rack up to $15K a year, then it wouldn't.

What if it would benefit them? Help them get into their university of choice? I benefited TREMENDOUSLY from the minimal tutoring I got and general support from my parents of not having to work during my education. I ended up with an advanced degree and a high paying job.

It's not a weekend road trip to the next state over. They're also in a country that provides Healthcare, paid parental leave for 70% for a 1.5 yrs and they have free education.  A child doesn't need private school or a house gifted to them. The friend saying that it's irresponsible to have kids if you can't do all that and doubling down on it is a subtle jab at OP.

For 3-4 kids? What kind of place do you send your kids to?\n\nWe pay just under $1,000 a month for 1 kid, so while, yes, in some places, some daycares are really expensive, that doesn't mean that EVERYONE needs to have $30k a year for daycare.\n\nBefore my older kid was in school I stayed home, because if I worked, our combined income would put us outside the income limits for them to have CHIP health insurance, and the cost of daycare, plus private health insurance would have been more than I was making...  so we SAVED money having me be home.  Now, that doesn't take into consideration lost raises, career growth, etc, so I can certainly understand why parents in certain careers would choose to keep working even if they were essentially losing money for a couple years...  but for many families, having one parent stay home is actually the financially conservative option.\n\nThis girl with her \"give my kid a house\" mentality is just making excuses.

The \\*sliding scale\\* daycare next to my previous employer was $3200/mo at the highest household income (150K+) but only went down to $1600 for people with household incomes less than 40K - that would be more than half of their monthly income just on childcare for ONE child.   \n\n\n$1K a month? It wasn't even that cheap a decade ago when I started tracking costs in my region. Nor was it that cheap in the much cheaper part of the country I grew up in. You're lucky to get away with a steal. It's why I'm 35 and have no friends with kids, despite all of us wanting them. And, at 35 with a past cancer history, the idea of possibly having twins using IVF (already several  tens of thousands of dollars) is absolutely terrifying because of daycare costs. But, if I don't work, I can't afford housing so even with those costs, it would be far more expensive to take time away from work. And as someone whose mother took time out of the workforce to raise us, the financial instability and poverty that followed is not viable for me.  \n\n\nMaybe the friend is making excuses.
