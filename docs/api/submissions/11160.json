None of it was about you. \n\n>At first I just told her that babies don't cost that much\n\nYes. Yes it does.\n\nBefore having a baby can be costly. Maternity clothes, prenatal vitamins, diet changes, pregnancy side effects/illnesses, etc. You can stay for weeks in the hospital if you're sick enough. Every single illness you could get could potentially hurt the fetus. Hospital bills add up and you can lose pay for missing work. \n\nJust *having* a baby at a hospital is expensive. I believe Forbes said somewhere it was near $20K on average in the US before insurance. That might include epidurals, delivery, etc. That doesn't include if there's any complications that might result in emergency C-sections, NICU, etc. \n\nNot to mention diapers, formula (even if you plan to breast feed, you will likely need some if you can't produce enough/not nutritious enough), clothes, stroller, cribe, and car seat that you'll need when the baby is born.\n\nOnce the baby is born, the mom is at risk for *other* health complications --not just PPD and PPA. That can last her entire life. And, again, hospitals are expensive.\n\nThen, you have to calculate childcare. Is one parent staying home with the kid? That's one salary gone. Is the kid going to daycare? How many hours a week? That adds up quickly. If you have a WFH job where you can watch the baby, or have a relative willing to help, then you're lucky. Not many people are. Until the kid is old enough for school, most parents will pay something in childcare for (a conservative estimate) four years. \n\nThen... school supplies, clothes, toys, anything for extracurriculars, lunch money for 12+ years. That adds up. According to the WashingtonPost, about $310K total from birth to 18. \n\nThat doesn't include cars, cell phone, college, etc.\n\n>They go on some many vacations and even just going on one less per year would cover for a baby's expenses.\n\nUnless your friend is taking vacations that rack up to $15K a year, then it wouldn't.

But just an $8,000 bill to her insurance is insanely low.", "$200, Australian.", "I think there\u2019s a lot of variables and depends on the situation of their relationship, where they live and their priorities. Where I live is very common to have kids even while renting, and at this moment in my life I would rather have a kid than buy a house or pay for a wedding.\n\nBut I totally understand where you are coming from", "You can be married and still end up a single mom. Marriage changes nothing about a relationship, it just makes it more administrative", "Stupid comment.", "It *is* irresponsible to have a child you can't afford LOL", "It sounds like she either doesn\u2019t actually want kids, or found out that she *can\u2019t* have kids, and is coming up with rationalizations after the fact.", "Yup, also fair. Kids change things.", "Oh the cost of children equating to possible fertility treatments is a good point too. OPs friend might have just found the other financial excuses less embarrassing to speak about to the group.", "I get fertility is expensive but going on and on about how much children cost in her ways of saying was pretty assholery because OP can\u2019t afford all that so her friend is saying she shouldn\u2019t have kids cuz she can\u2019t afford them cuz she can\u2019t afford x amount that\u2019s pretty ridiculous. It\u2019s not fun being raised in poverty but it\u2019s not the end of the world either. I\u2019m saying NTA.", "It is hard when you are trying to conceive and everyone around you is having children. The friend shouldn't have been so \"agressive\" about other people having children but she was directly asked so I think she was trying to divert the question, not accusing OP. \n\nI think there is a reason why the friend doesn't disclose her problems with OP and OP's reaction kinda confirms that OP is self-centred. No one was attacking OP, nonetheless, OP felt she was being attacked.\n\nAnyway, I hope the friend can overcome her problems if she still wants a child.", "Greatest username ever", "I think they were agreeing with you", "I don\u2019t think they\u2019re ignoring that context, I think they\u2019re considering the context of OP claiming skipping out on **one** trip a year would cover all the expenses of having a kid.\n\nUnless they are taking the most lux vacations I have ever heard of, there\u2019s a good chance your kids yearly dentistry and school *alone* would eat what they\u2019re saving on that trip. And that\u2019s still me being generous and assuming they aren\u2019t somewhere like the US where medical expenses are absolutely insane. Then you\u2019ll still have all their clothes and toys and food costs, increase in utilities once they\u2019re older, field trips, extracurriculars, play dates / friends birthday gifts, hobbies, daycare / babysitters\u2026 God forbid they\u2019re born disabled or have an accident and become disabled young, then you\u2019ll also have the cost of all the accommodations and therapy/treatments and assistance that they need. And this is still just the bare minimum \u201cdecent\u201d life you can give a kid. That\u2019s more than \u201cskipping one vacation a year\u201d money.", "One of the unfair parts of the insurance system is that insurance companies get way better deals on bills than struggling folks without insurance.", "Which is a pretty big up front expense even if you did save money in the long run", "This is true. I had kids while renting as well. It's just tough when you're young and your partner leaves. Guess I was thinking more along the lines of her having a bit more security.", "Only rich people from rich countries should have kids! - HALF THE COMMENTS IN THIS THREAD. It\u2019s insane to me regardless of what anyone thinks of who the asshole is in this situation.", "Eh I was born/live in the US and I definitely don\u2019t want to have a kid here. Have you seen our maternal mortality rate? Terrifying", "You're genuinely insane if you think I'd even *consider* raising a child in the US", "Stir that pot", "Yeah, especially in this day and age where children have started living with their parents for more and more years because of the increasing inflation costs without the appropriate increase in wages.", "Yeah you are right. I also had the feeling that maybe she took this so personal because their situation is not so stable but I hope I am wrong", "Doesn't matter what part of the world you're from, if you can't provide for your kids, don't have kids.", "I guess its just perspective on what some people think is expensive.", "Who said anything about not providing for your kids? Show me where that was stated, please. Do you believe if you can\u2019t purchase a house for your child at graduation, you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to have kids? Do you also believe that people from poorer countries shouldn\u2019t be allowed to have kids? OP at no point has claimed she cannot provide for her kids, and in fact pointed out exactly how she could. She only stated she felt her friends claim that if you can\u2019t afford to buy a house for your kid at graduation that you\u2019re irresponsible was insulting. Not sure I see why OP is wrong about that.", "You said people are claiming only rich people from rich countries should have kids. No one is saying that. Nor did I say that you have to provide your child with a house of their own after graduation. I stated that no one is entitled to having a child. Therefore only those that can provide for a child should have one. There are people in poor countries that can provide for a child just like there are people in rich countries that can't provide for a child. That's why most people are boiling it down to, if you can provide for a child, then you can have a child. If you can't provide for a child, don't have a fuckin child. It's not that hard to grasp, just cause you want a child doesn't mean you should have one."]}
