EM and I are the only ones in a relationship. I've been with my bf for 3 years but atm we're long-distance (6 hour flight away). Everyone else has never been in a relationship (not religious tho).\n\nWe moved in together last year; we all have private rooms and I have a private bathroom. We all had agreed on guest policies before signing the lease.\n\nOne year in, my roommates start getting bitter that EM and I have our boyfriends over. They limited our guests to twice a month even if it's for 1 hour (with 2 day notice) and they want us to coordinate our bfs so they don't feel like there's too much male presence (even tho they agreed that my bf was okay to visit before signing the lease).\n\nI'm very okay with respecting boundaries and sticking to house rules. However, I start having a problem when they don't respect their own rules.\n\n- They have female and some male friends over all the time without any notice. They don't wait for permission.\n- When EM and I ask for permission (I ask MONTHS in advance) no one responds in the gc, then they blame us and say we didn't wait for permission (even tho its days and no response)\n- They call us out on smallest mess (one drop of oil on the stove), but they never cleanup and our living room is a mess. 2 of them smoke and their ground weed is all over the table for weeks.\n- They stay up until 3am almost every night even on school/exam days.\n- They blame me and EM for not hanging out but when we make plans, they skip it out last minute.\n- I asked 4 months in advance if my bf can stay over for 3 days in my room. They said yes but a year later, they said they didn't like having guys in the house and referred to my bf staying for 3 days. Idk why they said okay but held on resentment. Me and my bf are always out, dont make a mess.\n\nBasically, EM and I agreed that it seems like they're blaming us on everything and taking out their stress on us. We're always willing to compromise but they always think they're in the right and not willing to compromise.\n\nEM and I decided to move out within the next 2 months. Our lease is month to month so no problem there.\n\nHowever, our roommates are calling us the AS since they have to find new roommates now (but doesn't affect anyone's rent).

Move out. You\u2019ve given them a heads up and your contract requires a month\u2019s notice. Definitely not asshole.", "NTA - At least half the roommate you will ever have will be jerks.  People lie about their personal habits and behavior all the time, even \"friends\".  They especially lie about breaking things, making messes, and leaving trash everywhere. \n\nGet out while it's convenient, drop the others from your contact list, and move ahead in your life.  You don't need to housekeep for sloppy roommates or listen to their gripes.", "They made you seek permission for your bf to stay in your room for a couple of days here and there, not the common areas, but your room. Nta-everyone deserves fair/equal treatment. For the record, you shouldn\u2019t be asking to have your bf in your room, you should be informing them of when he\u2019s going to be there, so they aren\u2019t surprised, and if they think he\u2019s a strain on utilities, they can bring it up for discussion.", "Nta. They literally don't have ANY authority to limit or demand notices of guests. Sorry not sorry, but that's facts. \nSure, as a courtesy you should give a heads up, but it's not a requirement. You're an adult and you get to live as such. \nPart of living with roommates is that you have to learn to put up with a bit of crap and inconvenience here n there...within reason. \nYou don't get to dictate who comes and goes. You can have ppl over twice a week. That's a reasonable amount and if they feel a tiny bit uncomfy...that's too bad.\nMoving out was Smart. They were making your life unlivable an harassing you over minor issues...they can cover the extra rent until they figure out how to get along with others", "NTA if they are gonna be hypocritical about the rules then it\u2019s good to move. Anyone has every right to move if they don\u2019t feel comfortable there or have the same living expectations. They should\u2019ve apologized to you for making you deal with their BS switching up like that.", "NTA - frankly, I wouldn\u2019t have even given them notice, just moved out as soon as a new place is secured.", "They feel entitled to police your guests, but not theirs. They bully you for leaving some small oil residue after cooking, but allow themselves to live like pigs in their own slop? That\u2019s not friendship. Real friends won\u2019t treat you like a doormat. NTA", "NTA - flatting situations are never forever, and it sounds like if you want to retain any of the friendship, it's time to change up some of the living situation.", "NTA..  don't class them as friends. They are just nasty people you know.. don't feel any guilt about moving out, good move for your mental health..", "NTA.", "NTA. But you should have left already", "NTA, you are all (presumably) adults. If you pay rent , you what to do what you want with your space and everyone has to be free to use the common areas as needed. Being picked on for not cleaning when they don't is just being entitled and childish. You get another vote to just go, if they have issues with rent or costs, that is their problem not yours.", "NTA and hope you find something great!", "NTA. I was going to suggest you & EM move out but I'm happy to see it's already in the works. Screw those 4 AHs.", "NTA, you and EM are in a different point in life.  You both have a relationship partner.  You want to study and grow in life.  They are still in the University party life.  You have given them notice and owe them nothing more.  I would advise getting a storage unit and start to move your belongings there.  Things like furniture, kitchen item.  If possible, move your bedroom furniture out and just leave the mattress for the last few weeks.  It will make you exit faster and there is less chance of them taking their grievances out on your belongings.", "NTA. They're not treating you well yet expect you to stick around to be abused? That's a no. They need to have the same rules for all guests not just single out boyfriends.\n\nI think they're jealous that you and Em have boyfriends because they're tyring to make the space a no bf space yet bring their male friends over with no notice. It's clearly not about gender but about relationship status.\n\nSomeone was inevitably going to move out, no worries there, they can't keep you forever since they're mistreating you. Find a better apartment.", "If you're such friends why are they being such assholes? Why are they complete hypocrites who treat even the slightest mess by you as a federal issue, but leave their trash around? I'd make it a point to throw their bullshit in their faces and demand a good goddamn reason why you should put up with it if they can't give a solid reason for their behaviour.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThey're not 'friends.' You and EM are their fall guys. Move out and move on.", "Info: why don't you allow them to have male guests spend the night? I think it's a bit hypocritical that you don't allow male guests, but they have to allow your boyfriend. I mean, if they're bringing male guests over and they go straight to their private room, what does it matter?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They\u2019re behaving like assholes.", "Why do you think they could be acting like this? We used to be close friends. I always clean up and follow their house rules so I don't understand why they would single out me and EM like that.", "I'm definitely cutting contact once I'm finished living with them. Thank you for the advice", "When I informed them one time, one of my roommates called me out and said \"When did you stop asking permission\"...", "One of my roommates is using an excuse, saying: \"Tbh, I'm not comfortable with the male presence and I feel like you and EM keep pushing my boundaries by having your bfs visit.\" She NEVER mentioned this before we signed the lease...", "Yeah, I'm definitely cutting contact after I leave. The crazy thing is that they think they're good friends while me and EM are bad friends...", "Tbh, I'm not optimistic about the friendship. They've been very inconsiderate as friends and very comfortable with snapping at me just bc they had a stressful day.", "It's not that easy to find a place and leave but I wish we had never signed the lease in the first place.", "I think it's because they draw a difference between male friends vs boyfriends. They're okay with their male friend over even in the living room, but they're not okay with me and EM's boyfriends visiting us in our rooms. It's very hypocritical so that's why we're sorting into moving out. It's 4 of them against 2 of us so even when we bring up the unfairness, they don't acknowledge it.", "Our only dilemma is that we really like our current place right now and we already settled into our rooms. We found a new place just for us 2 that's slightly cheaper in rent but we'll have to buy new furnitures since our current place came in furnished. We're debating if we should just shoulder through till the year ends or if better to move out. Our roommates are really passive aggressive, they sometimes ignore us to our faces and other stuff to make us feel really mentally tired. This is also our final year in college.", "Different lifestyles. You\u2019re in a relationship, you don\u2019t party/hang out late much, you clean up. Being good friends doesn\u2019t imply you\u2019re compatible to live together. It\u2019s a pity.", "NTA. Why are they acting like this, resentment. They expect you 2 to be exactly like them & you\u2019re not. They want things clean but you won\u2019t pick up after them. You\u2019re in grown up relationships & they\u2019re still acting like spoiled teens. You\u2019re doing the right thing, get out of there & save your sanity", "Well, living with other people you get to see their true colors and oh boy did they show it. NTA btw, you stuck to house rules and plainly clear your 'friends' didn't care about them at all. Maybe they singled you and EM out because you guys had bfs and they didn't.", "Because you are starting to act like an adult, and they are still stuck in party on mode.", "I would have had it out with them at that point. You\u2019re way too considerate to have these folks up your ass. Enjoy the new place with the roomie that actually gets it", "Yeah that's TOO BAD. You never agreed to not have males over. They can stfu.", "She's only mentioning it because she doensn't have a bf. I guarantee you the minute she's dating someone only your and Em's bfs would be a problem.", "Yeah, definitely sounds like you're right to be moving on then!", "Hope you update as soon as your gone.", "But you're not okay with their male friends being over. Do you see the difference? They're essentially isn't any. They're allowed to say no to guys coming over just as you're allowed to say no to guys coming over. Relationship status doesn't play a part in it. If you say no, you should expect for them to say no.", "It depends. It is hard to say because im not in your situation.  Just stay in your room and dont come out would be my advice.", "Yeah. I'm also introverted so I need a lot of time to recharge, that's why I wanted a private room. But my roommates are always in the living room until 3AM, smoking and goofing around. They hold it against me for not joining them even tho I've been telling them that I need time to recharge. One time my roommate told me: \"I'm confused. You keep saying you need to recharge but didn't you go to 2 parties last week?\" Like it's so weird she was keeping track...", "The thing is, they don't have any friends besides each other. I think that's why they get really mad that I don't stay up with them until 2-3am every night.", "I've always been okay with their male guests. I don't have any problem if my roommates want to bring guests to their own rooms. But I'm not okay that they put a double standard on me. They're not okay with my bf visiting me.", "That's another option too. I think it's technically financially better to just shoulder thru but definitely mentally more tiring.", "Jealousy.    You make them feel inferior in their smoke and booze addled brains.     You sound like you have your shit together, and it is glaringly obvious that they don't.     Hence targeting you and your SO.", "Are still in school or are you working or both.  What about them.", "\"One year in, my roommates start getting bitter that EM and I are the only ones who have male guests.\" \n\nWhy are you the only ones having male guests?", "Limiting interaction is the best way", "We are all students with campus jobs. They're also in the pre-med track but I feel like they never study because they distract each other. Everyone besides me and EM have already failed classes and had to retake.", "Context mistake. They're bitter that me and EM have our boyfriends over.", "It is best that you and EM get out of there.  Devote your time to your studies.  You can only fail so many classes before you are booted from university. You can only show up hung over, late or miss shifts before you lose a on campus job.   There is a huge waiting list on most campuses for those jobs.  The bigger issue is that by living with them you will also get a reputation of being a party girl. This will hurt you getting into med school.  Just bide your time until the two of you can get out of there.  Best of luck in your studies.  You are showing a great maturity for your age.  This shows you are going places in life and will be a great doctor one day.", "Honestly, do what you need to do! If your month to month, then there's nothing that's holding you."]}
