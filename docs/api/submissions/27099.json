They said yes but a year later, they said they didn't like having guys in the house and referred to my bf staying for 3 days. Idk why they said okay but held on resentment. Me and my bf are always out, dont make a mess.\n\nBasically, EM and I agreed that it seems like they're blaming us on everything and taking out their stress on us. We're always willing to compromise but they always think they're in the right and not willing to compromise.\n\nEM and I decided to move out within the next 2 months.

People lie about their personal habits and behavior all the time, even \"friends\".

You don't need to housekeep for sloppy roommates or listen to their gripes.", "They made you seek permission for your bf to stay in your room for a couple of days here and there, not the common areas, but your room. Nta-everyone deserves fair/equal treatment. For the record, you shouldn\u2019t be asking to have your bf in your room, you should be informing them of when he\u2019s going to be there, so they aren\u2019t surprised, and if they think he\u2019s a strain on utilities, they can bring it up for discussion.", "Nta. They literally don't have ANY authority to limit or demand notices of guests. Sorry not sorry, but that's facts. \nSure, as a courtesy you should give a heads up, but it's not a requirement. You're an adult and you get to live as such. \nPart of living with roommates is that you have to learn to put up with a bit of crap and inconvenience here n there...within reason. \nYou don't get to dictate who comes and goes. You can have ppl over twice a week. That's a reasonable amount and if they feel a tiny bit uncomfy...that's too bad.\nMoving out was Smart. They were making your life unlivable an harassing you over minor issues...they can cover the extra rent until they figure out how to get along with others", "NTA if they are gonna be hypocritical about the rules then it\u2019s good to move. Anyone has every right to move if they don\u2019t feel comfortable there or when they don\u2019t have the same living expectations. They should\u2019ve apologized to you for making you deal with their BS switching up like that.", "NTA - frankly, I wouldn\u2019t have even given them notice, just moved out as soon as a new place is secured.", "They feel entitled to police your guests, but not theirs. They bully you for leaving some small oil residue after cooking, but allow themselves to live like pigs in their own slop? That\u2019s not friendship.

But you should have left already", "NTA, you are all (presumably) adults. If you pay rent , you what to do what you want with your space and everyone has to be free to use the common areas as needed. Being picked on for not cleaning when they don't is just being entitled and childish. You get another vote to just go, if they have issues with rent or costs, that is their problem not yours.", "NTA and hope you find something great!", "NTA. I was going to suggest you & EM move out but I'm happy to see it's already in the works. Screw those 4 AHs.", "NTA, you and EM are in a different point in life.  You both have a relationship partner.  You want to study and grow in life.  They are still in the University party life.  You have given them notice and owe them nothing more.  I would advise getting a storage unit and start to move your belongings there.  Things like furniture, kitchen item.  If possible, move your bedroom furniture out and just leave the mattress for the last few weeks.  It will make you exit faster and there is less chance of them taking their grievances out on your belongings.", "NTA. They're not treating you well yet expect you to stick around to be abused? That's a no. They need to have the same rules for all guests not just single out boyfriends.\n\nI think they're jealous that you and Em have boyfriends because they're tyring to make the space a no bf space yet bring their male friends over with no notice.

Thank you for the advice", "When I informed them one time, one of my roommates called me out and said \"When did you stop asking permission\"...", "One of my roommates is using an excuse, saying: \"Tbh, I'm not comfortable with the male presence and I feel like you and EM keep pushing my boundaries by having your bfs visit.\" She NEVER mentioned this before we signed the lease...", "Yeah, I'm definitely cutting contact after I leave. The crazy thing is that they think they're good friends while me and EM are bad friends...", "Tbh, I'm not optimistic about the friendship. They've been very inconsiderate as friends and very comfortable with snapping at me just bc they had a stressful day.", "It's not that easy to find a place and leave but I wish we had never signed the lease in the first place.", "I think it's because they draw a difference between male friends vs boyfriends. They're okay with their male friend over even in the living room, but they're not okay with me and EM's boyfriends visiting us in our rooms. It's very hypocritical so that's why we're sorting into moving out. It's 4 of them against 2 of us so even when we bring up the unfairness, they don't acknowledge it.", "Our only dilemma is that we really like our current place right now and we already settled into our rooms. We found a new place just for us 2 that's slightly cheaper in rent but we'll have to buy new furnitures since our current place came in furnished.

You\u2019re doing the right thing, get out of there & save your sanity", "Well, living with other people you get to see their true colors and oh boy did they show it.

Do you see the difference? They're essentially isn't any. They're allowed to say no to guys coming over just as you're allowed to say no to guys coming over.

You can only fail so many classes before you are booted from university. You can only show up hung over, late or miss shifts before you lose a on campus job.   There is a huge waiting list on most campuses for those jobs.  The bigger issue is that by living with them you will also get a reputation of being a party girl. This will hurt you getting into med school.  Just bide your time until the two of you can get out of there.  Best of luck in your studies.  You are showing a great maturity for your age.
