You can have ppl over twice a week. That's a reasonable amount and if they feel a tiny bit uncomfy...that's too bad.\nMoving out was Smart.

In general, the whole roommate thing gets old as you do.  By the time I was 25 I was all done.", "This. OP, it sounds like your friends are at a different stage in their lives. They want to party and bring random friends and people over. They DON'T want to feel like the third wheel for a couple who are in a loving relationship. You guys are just incompatible. But, I would move out. Right now, you're frustrated with them. In a little while, you'll grow to hate them. Better to leave before the friendships are ruined.", "[removed]", "We noticed a res flag where the only time they were nice to EM was when she was going thru a really rough break up (got cheated on). As soon as she started seeing someone else later in the year, they started singling her out again and acting passive aggressive. I can't believe our \"friends\" treat us like this because of guys. If EM and I were horrible roommates, I would understand. But, we've both adhered to all their rules. They constantly keep changing it last minute and only applying it to the two of us.", "Sorry about that hehe", "It's 4 of them against 2 of us so they either gaslight us or promise to change (clean up more) but never do. Or, they will clean once in a blue moon and like they did so much", "One of our friends actually did move out before we all moved in. Apparently the same girls were found talking shit behind her back and calling her a bully. That should have been my sign but I was being naive in thinking we could make the friendship work.", "They act so passive aggressive and even make our bfs feel unwelcome. That's why we still try to ask them.", "Living together is a major stressor on friendships. It sort of exposes all the things you *dont* have in common. \n\nDifferent cleanliness standards, how you engage in relationships, etc \n\nSounds like they have some bitterness to work through and decided to just pile on", "Friendships, like all relationships, have shelf lives. Some last a lifetime, some last a season - most fall somewhere in between. You and EM are moving on in your lives, you have entered the post college phase that is adulthood. Your roommates are still living like they are in college. They aren't interested in responsibility, but are happy to have you and EM shoulder that - you have effectively become the \"parents\" in this situation as you clean up, and take on the adult portion of the work. But this has become a family where the kids are in charge rather than the parents, in the guise of \"democracy.\" Basically they are bullying you, and you both have been reluctant participants.   \nSo it is time for you to move on. At some point they may grow up and join the world of adults, and they may reconnect with you, which may or may not work out. But maybe take this situation as one where you learn to set and hold boundaries. They have been creating \"rules\" for you that stomp on your boundaries while flouting those rules themselves. Even as an introvert you are allowed to say what is and isn't working for you. Conflict can be a positive thing, it can teach us to stand up for ourselves, to value ourselves. It gives us agency over our lives - work and personal. Take this opportunity as the gift it is.   \nFinally - they can call you all the names they want. You have to not care, which is also part of that agency thing. Of course they think that, they are losing the live in help!", "Jealousy", "They're massive, jealous, AH's and their house rules are utter fucking lunacy.\n\nThey probably don't want you to move out because no one in their right mind would agree to the rules they've forced on you.", "This is the main reason I recommend not living with friends. It adds a new dynamic and a new layer of stress that can strain or destroy a friendship.", "Doesn't matter why. People change. And maybe they or you and EM changed in different ways. What does matter is that you can't live your life the way you want to with them and it it time to go. Nothing lasts forever.", "NTA and I\u2019m glad EM is on the same page \u2014 maybe it will be easier to find a place.\n\nAnd cutting contact for a while is probably a good idea but if you ever find you miss them and want to meet for coffee or dinner, that\u2019s fine and it still allows YOU to set the parameters.\n\nI have lived friends who were bad roommates and things got tense, but after some time and space we could enjoy each other\u2019s company again. Now we\u2019re all in our 50s and in different cities so we want to be in touch more.\n\nBut if you never socialize with them again, that\u2019s also valid. You get the choice.", "\"When you did.\"", "I amazes me how people manage to weaponize therapy speak.", "It\u2019s because these people aren\u2019t your friends. They might\u2019ve been at one point but they certainly aren\u2019t now.", "She's never told this to me signing the lease before even tho she knew I have a long-term bf who visits me sometimes.", "I mean, what do they think you needed recharging *from*? As you mature, you will find that some friends were just for-now friends and that's okay. Your lifestyles are no longer compatible and they seem to take exception to that \u2013\u00a0that's a them problem. You'll find new friends that are more compatible and they'll get over it. And you may find you're better friends not being roommates!", "Yeah, they don't understand you and they don't really have to. They just need to accept and respect you. Since that isn't happening, you'll be much happier with fewer people to try and keep happy.", "There is also a difference between them having a male guest in the rooms and the living room/kitchen, and how much any guest, any gender, is there period. I agree the problem is their double standard, but from what you described it also sounds as if wherever you go in the apartment, their friends are there. That\u2019s not OK. You have a right to use your living room and kitchen sometimes without always having someone there who doesn\u2019t live with you. And the way you talk I get the impression your boyfriend is very considerate of that.", "And that would be a 'them' problem.  \n\nOP and other roommates are allowed to move out for whatever reason they deem acceptable.  End of story.\n\nNTA.  Move now.  And these folks don't sound like friends anymore, you may want to stop interacting with them.", "I definitely see a pattern where I feel like if I bring up any good news, they will either not care or get bitter. EM hid the fact that she started working as an MA for the whole summer bc she felt like they would react badly. When my bf ordered me flowers for our anniversary, I had to hide my flowers in the room bc I felt like they would start getting more passive aggressive if they saw it. It's not even the whole guest policy that's making me and EM want to move out. It's the fact that for some reason they make us feel like we're such bad friends and we have to prove our worth to them...I can't believe it's our last year in college and they're acting like this.", "Never heard this saying before.  Reddit is so full of mysterious sayings. I'm learning.", "I think it's as simple as this, OP: You've grown up, and understand grown-up responsibilities. Your roommates have not, and do not, and resent it when they are confronted with that fact. Move out with EM, and be adults together. Enjoy!", "But you do fail to get accepted to med school.", "True, but it doesn't sound like they are even actively applying. Applying to med school is almost a job in itself, and the process can extend far beyond graduation", "Oh, NTA.\n\n1. If they wanted to keep you as roommates, they would have been less of a nightmare to live with.\n2. Not your problem that they (1) have to find other people to live with and (2) are jealous of you and Em having bfs.\n3. They didn't honor the rules/agreement or respond to communications in a reasonable time/manner.\n4. They haven't been acting like friends in any way for a long time. Think there's not much of a friendship to claim or to salvage.... and... Most of all...\n5. They already blame you for everything while you live there; of course they are going to blame you for everything as you leave! (Who cares what they think?)", "Didn\u2019t finish but you are NTA, they\u2019re gaslighting into manipulating you so they can have more power in the relationship between you and the other roommate. They\u2019re secretly jealous of your relationships so they\u2019re trying to make you miserable to make themselves feel better. You are more than considerate and don\u2019t let them bring you down \ud83d\ude01", "Screw them, NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re being incredibly reasonable and have actually been too nice for too long. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re moving out! It will be so much better for you.", "NTA move out and never speak to them again. They are jealous of you two. And you two are stupid for letting these roommates dictate what you can and can\u2019t do even though they do not respect the rules.", "Nta. They want to change the rules for their benefit yet do not follow any themselves. When its come down to \"us versus them\" its alrdy over. Go & be happy. No reason to stay & be miserable.", "NTA. There's nothing here that tells me you're welcome there. I do understand not having the SO's over for long periods or too often, but the process sounds bad. To me, the lack of a response equates to apathy.", "NTA. You should never have to pay to live with someone you don't like living with.", "[removed]", "There\u2019s an old saying that you should never be roommates with your best friends, because that\u2019s the fastest way to end a friendship. Just because you\u2019re compatible friends doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re compatible roommates. \n\nBut also to answer your question - they are most likely jealous of your boyfriend(s) and/or it\u2019s easy to use them as scapegoats since they don\u2019t actually live there.", "I thought really hard about your question. I came to the conclusion that they are jealous and also knew you two are push overs.", "College friends will fade right after college stops binding you together. It's a part of life.", "NTA. You signed a lease for your room and reasonable use of common areas. They don't get to control who/what you do in your own room. Unless your landlord has a problem with it, your room mates can kick rocks. \n\nThe answer to the above question is \"when i realized I don't have to.\"", "I can't fault you for that. EM and I don't like confrontation and just want a peaceful environment so it might have made us seem like push overs. I'm just sad that my friends would take advantage of us like that.", "Stop analyzing things. You\u2019re moving out and enjoy life!", "We\u2019ll move out and love lofe", "See they are jealous and stupid at that. Keep away from them!", "2!", "Boo is American English slang for a romantic partner! One possible origin is from the French word beau."]}
