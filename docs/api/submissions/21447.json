Everyone over the age of 12 should know not to order food without knowing who is paying for it, and assuming someone else is paying for it, especially once you are an adult, is insane.

What she did, when she backed you into a corner of having to cover for her financially and then was nasty when she thanked you shows me that's she ungrateful and entitled.  She isn't owed a meal because she quit, and she could've, at the very least, asked you to cover for her. And you're allowed to say no.

Technically, I am disabled tool but my disability doesn't qualify me for the same benefits that my brother is receiving; I have not choice but to work, he only has to for extra drug money. \n\nAnd it's super shitty for someone receiving disability income to expect other people to support two f\\*cking households because they can't/won't manage their money.
