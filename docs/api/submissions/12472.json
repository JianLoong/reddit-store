A lot of apartment buildings, especially older ones, are not well insulated and the temperature of the units below and next to yours make a difference. Sometimes even a significant difference. In addition, her bill is also higher because prices have been rising across the board AND she's likely more home (thus using more electricity and heat) during the cold winter months, especially at her age.

For heat pumps, they actually can work harder and they are less efficient. Some even kick a resistive heater on if it gets too behind. In which case, yes it's less efficient doing what OP is doing\n\nBut heaters have to do two things: replace the heat that's left the home, and if the temperature is changing, raise the thermal energy of things in the house. If you keep a constant temperature, the latter is zero. If you change temperature, the rate of the former stays the same but since the heat set to lower, the lost heat comes frkm the thermal mass of the house, lowering its temperature. As the temperature goes down, the rate of heat escaping outside gets smaller. When you turn the heat back up, the heater has to replace the thermal energy that was lost, but that amount is lower than the heat it would have needed to put out to keep a constant temperature.", "I know it doesn't technically work harder. I meant it will run longer to bring the room up say 7 degrees every night than it would if it was kept at the same temperature.

The HVAC guys that installed it said there would be very little impact on energy usage by using a daily cycle because of the way the furnace works. The \u201cturning back on\u201d stage is what usually requires the most energy, as opposed to time/energy consumed to re-heat the house. My understanding is that most temp control systems- ac, water pump, whatnot- still have that \u201cturn back on\u201d cycle, where yeah, it absolutely makes a difference to maintain the temperature instead of changing it a lot, and that there are some (newer?) systems where it really doesn\u2019t make a difference"]}
