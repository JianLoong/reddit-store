I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if his parents had a time limit or conditions on their support and it was cut off because they didn\u2019t hold up their end of the deal. This has nothing to do with you and if your parents push the issue they will be punishing you for making good decisions and rewarding your sister/BIL for making bad ones.", "NTA.  You have no obligation to assist them in any way.  Assistance to them is money down the drain.  Your retirement account should be getting 10% of your income plus whatever you can spare.
