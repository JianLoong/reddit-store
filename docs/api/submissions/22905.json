{"id": 22905, "submission_id": "156nzrv", "title": "AITA for trying to lose weight?", "selftext": "I (30F) have noticed that I've gained about 10 pounds over the years and have been making small changes to try and lose weight. I'm getting older and realize my metabolism is probably slowing, so I want to start working on it before it gets worse. I don't consider myself to be overweight, but my personal preference is that I'm around 125 lbs. I'm 5'4\" and currently 138. again, I don't think I NEED to lose weight, but I want to. I would still be perfectly healthy at 125 lbs. \n\nThe problem is my sister (37F) said that what I'm doing is triggering to her. She is a bit overweight and has really struggled with her body image for years. My heart breaks for her because I think she's beautiful and wish she could see that. But she thinks that me trying to lose a little weight is indirectly saying she needs to. To be clear, I have been making an effort to NOT talk about it around her because I know it's a sensitive topic. But because I got a Bowflex and have mentioned that I'm being mindful of calories, she said it's really triggering for her and it's hurtful. It's only come up in conversation because we want to meet for lunch and I said I want to go on my cheat day, and another time I mentioned that my husband and I are trying to eat healthier to get in better shape. But my sister hasn't had good experiences in the past with calorie counting and believes that it's toxic. I recognize that may be the case for some people, but for me I feel fine doing it and find that it's helpful.\n\nMy sister says she's worried about me and doesn't think I should lose a single pound. I don't think it's fair to me, because I feel like this is a personal choice that is nobody else's business. I'm still eating 3 meals a day, I'm not starving myself, and I'm not hurting anyone else. I'm basically just not eating snacks, junk food/candy, drinking soda, and I'm keeping my meals all around 400-500 calories. But even if I don't ever bring up the topic, my sister says just by me doing what I'm doing, I'm triggering her. \n\nAITA?\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI talked to my sister and explained that my choices are my own and I have a right to do what I think is best for me. I told her that I can respect her boundary by not talking about it around her, and she needs to respect me by trusting that I know what I'm doing and I'm doing what's best for me. I also told her that my choices have nothing to do with her and that her feeling hurt or insecure is the last thing I want. I said that making these changes in my life by no means is making any comment about her body. I told her I love her and think she's beautiful regardless, and I just want her to be happy. \n\nShe apologized and recognized that I didn't do anything wrong and that it's just her own deep rooted issues with her body that she needs to work on. To those saying she's narcissistic, I disagree. She's never been that way towards me. She's only human and has her own insecurities just like anyone else. None of us are perfect humans all the time. I love her dearly and it breaks my heart that she's in pain and struggling so much. \n\nLastly I just want to mention that this wasn't a post to bash on my sister, so I don't appreciate the fat phobic comments that have been coming in here and there. I appreciate the support but saying cruel things is unnecessary and not the point of this post. \n\nThank you for all the great advice. I have been reading all the comments and they are so appreciated!", "created_utc": 1690041949, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156nzrv/aita_for_trying_to_lose_weight/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
