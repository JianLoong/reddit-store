I haven't seen Nora outside of work much (Even at work, I don't see her a lot because she is at the very top of the hierarchy and I don't have a lot of work that directly needs her attention - but everyone agrees that she is an awesome boss). That changed when James' uncle (Nora's dad) invited the whole family including James and I over to his house for dinner. Notably, James doesn't like Nora for reasons I don't understand.\n\nObviously, Nora, her wife and kids were there as well. She didn't make a big deal out of being my boss and I felt super comfortable in the family environment. Everyone was initially very sweet.

I don't have a lot of experience but she is the kindest, most inspiring boss one could wish for. She works double all of her employees and never makes anyone feel like they're being taken advantage of. She appreciates everyone's efforts and that's why everyone at work is actually happy to work overtime and help her with stuff. \n\nI told James' dad exactly all this. He didn't like the answer but I could tell Nora and her wife were loving it. And I added that despite not having a lot of experience, I was more than happy to work in the same company as Nora did. The conversation ended there. I thought that was the end of the story.\n\nOn the way back, James asked me what the actual F was going on because I totally humiliated his dad in front of the whole family. He said his dad liked teasing Nora and it wasn't personal and I should have just avoided the question and ignored that.\n\nI said I honestly don't get how I humiliated him. James hasn't talked to me ever since and thinks I owe his dad an apology. I asked me colleagues and they all agrees that it was absolutely ridiculous to criticise Nora as a boss like that in the first place.

If dad likes to tease Nora, that's his business. You're not obligated to go along with that. Especially since you had no idea about this \"teasing\" he likes to do, which is really bullying. You haven't sold yourself as a mind reader, so how were you supposed to know that?\n\nEven if you had, why would James or his dad expect you to go along with it?

So James and his dad can continue hating on Nora for stuff that clearly had nothing to do with you and everything to do with family dynamics you have no business being pulled into? \n\nNah, miss me with that. \n\nJames' dad is humiliated because he's used to getting away with bullying Nora. He did it to her in HER father's house, which just shows how much everyone had been letting this happen. Now he's lost face because he tried to drag you into the family tradition and you didn't go along.\n\nIt is unfair to expect that of you and unfair for your bf to be mad at you over it.\n\nHonestly, you may need to rethink your relationship with James.

Red flag!!!", "Your BF's dad owes OP an apology, for putting her on the spot with an utterly inappropriate attempt to try to draw her into the tasteless \"teasing\" of her boss.  I mean  - talk about putting a junior employee on the spot! \n\nThis is apart from the fact that this kind of \"teasing\" is intrinsically awful anyway. Who is supposed to find this funny, exactly, and why?

Typically the butt of the \"joke\" doesn't enjoy it, or isn't present. \n\nThe fact that they got mad about it and berated her after the fact is ridiculous, and Nora/her partner seeming to enjoy it indicates there's something deeper happening here.\n\nAlso, again, insulting people is not an acceptable icebreaker. Just because a bunch of people do something for a long time doesn't mean it's right.

James and his dad tried to use you to humiliate Nora. They were willing to sabotage your career over their rediculous beef. You need to really think carefully about the full ramifications of this. Your bf willingly placed you in a precarious position and expects you to set back your career to engage in a toxic humiliation of your boss. Even if Nora couldn't fire you, she could make your working life miserable. She can affect your career opportunities and writes your employee reviews. I am skeptical the cause of their dislike has any reasonable basis or they just wouldn't invite her. Plus, they would have told you the terrible thing she did to get you on side.
