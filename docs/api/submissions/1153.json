She moved into my apartment and we decided to split the rent in half between us. From the beginning i told her right away that I keep my home clean and tidy. I wash the dishes after every meal and never leave them more than a few hours. I also clean the table after using it and I fix the sofa after sitting there. I also clean the bathroom often so it doesn\u2019t get dirty, I don\u2019t wait a week to do it on 1 day, I keep it clean after being there. I also throw the trash after the bin is full. And I don\u2019t over use the things I buy because I don\u2019t have a huge salary and the rent is high. \n\nSince my friend moved in I have noticed that she does not have the same priorities as me. She leaves her dishes for days, also using up all the knifes and forks which means I have none left to use. She leaves her dishes so long they start to smell, and she also uses my pots without cleaning them which leaves me with having to do her dishes just so I can use them. \nShe doesn\u2019t change the garbage bag even though it\u2019s over full and when she does she leaves the trash bag at the door even though we have a garbage disposal right outside the door. \nShe also leaves her dishes and left over take out boxes for days on the living room table we share.

I caught her leaving a n empty butter container in the fridge so that she could pretend to have butter left so I didn\u2019t notice her using mine. I told her again to tell me so I don\u2019t lose count of what I have and how much of it. May I add that she comes from a rich family and I don\u2019t.

She is used to anyone but her doing clean up and shopping. She won't change unless you do and I don't think you should have to. No biggie unless you make it one.
