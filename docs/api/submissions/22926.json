From teen to early 20s I had regular huge fights with her over this and personally I think our relationship never recovered. I\u2019m usually not a person that holds grudges but I still can\u2019t let that go.\n\nI thought the snooping stopped when I moved out years ago, but when I was home over Christmas this year I had a rental agreement from my new place in my bag. At some point during the holidays my mom somehow knew my new landlords home address and the exact amount of my rent, which I never mentioned. \nWhich means when I left the house to do god knows what she went to her 28yo daughters room, opened my backpack, went through my stuff to find my private documents and then proceeded to read them. \n\nIt\u2019s good you showed your parents a lesson but I can 100% assure you that people never change and they will still do it unless you lock the door or use a safe with a PIN code for your personal stuff.", "I was sure the parents were snooping in my room at age 25 ish.

Friend said \"I really wish you wouldn't open my mail, mom\".  \n\nHer mother said \"I can look at it if I want to, you're in my house.\"  She then noticed the rather horrified look on my face and said rather smugly \"is there something wrong with that?\"\n\nI answered \"Besides it being a **FEDERAL CRIME**?  Jesus Christ, what the hell is wrong with you?  Your daughter has never given you any reason to distrust her, why are you playing J.

I was talking to my dad about it; he\u2019s like nah you don\u2019t. Then he proceeds to tell several stories of me as a child that clearly point to autism.
