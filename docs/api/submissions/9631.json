Teachers should be held to the same privacy agreements as health care providers imo.", "> He asked me to be understanding because she's young and lives online.\n\nYou were understanding. You didn't report her to the principal in an attempt to get her fired. Instead you reamed her like she deserved to be. Logical consequences. JFC NTA", "I\u2019m a teacher and I\u2019m shocked at the lack of professionalism at your children\u2019s school. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that Mrs. F betrayed your trust by speaking to a journalist (without your permission) and it\u2019s even worse that the VP is defending her actions. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I'd report her to the school board. This is a serious violation of your privacy and the vice principal doesn't seem to be taking it seriously.", "NTA. I don't know what country this is but I'd assume giving that much information out on your students is a HUGE breach of privacy. Even just as a staff in an after-school program, that stuff wasn't allowed. She's lucky that's all you did.", "NTA. You were not out of line at all. If you lived in Europe or the UK she would have broken the law by doing what she did and could very well lose her job. In fact it is a pity she hasn't lost her job.", "NTA the teacher could have very easily just asked you if giving your phone number to the reporter was something you were comfortable with. Not everyone wants to have their personal lives out there and she should have known that", "NTA\n\n>She probably thought I\u2019d complain to the principal but that\u2019s not my style.  I will tell you stuff to your face.\n\nNo dude.  There are times when you *need* to report people.

That macho \u201cI will tell you to your face\u201d bs doesn\u2019t cut it.\n\nShe deserved to be cussed out, but she also needs to be professionally reprimanded and put under a microscope to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again.", "NTA - she should have taken down the reporter's info and passed it on to you to decide how you wanted to proceed.  However, you could probably have been a bit more appropriate with how you handled the teacher and vice-principal.  I get that you were worked up, but you sound like you handled it pretty harshly", "NTA tell the real principle that a teacher is giving out you and your children\u2019s personal information without permission, and that she\u2019s harassing you when you complained. It\u2019s not appropriate and may even be touching some legal grey areas.", "Thats a goddamn safeguarding YIKES if I have ever seen one, NTA and you need to get this T'd and I'd because this IS NOT OK.", "NTA.  Yikes - What an extreme violation of privacy, I'm sure the school has a policy about not sharing student/parent information.", "NTA. I probably would have consulted an attorney. If there isn't a law protecting your private information in a setting like this, there damn well should be.", "NTA. At least have her moved to a different school. HOLY MOLY I am so mad for you. I would have done worse and my kids are all 17+. The excuse of Gen Z is weak weak weak.  Gen Z know better than us not to do this to people. \n\nCease and Desist to the reporter ASAP.\n\nGet that teacher moved and the VP disciplined ASAP. \n\nYOU'RE THE BEST DAD AND EVERYONE WITH A WORKING BRAIN IS VERY PROUD OF YOU!", "NTA. Let's take you out of the picture for a second--this teacher revealed personal details about her students to a third party without the parent's permission or any sort of legal reason (like reporting abuse). This is a major violation of educational privacy, and the fact that the principal is covering for her (rather than writing her up) is only fanning the fire.  Contact the district superintendent and, if that doesn't work, contact a lawyer.", "NTA but holy hell you NEED to report her. She actually needs to face consequences for this, this is a HUGE privacy violation. Not only did she speak to media on your behalf without your knowledge or consent:\n\n#She gave THE MEDIA your personal phone number and the names and details of your minor children - details that are protected by education laws in MANY countries for very good reason!!!\n\nI don\u2019t care if she \u201clives online\u201d, that is not an excuse. This was so out of line that I can\u2019t even see the line anymore. I\u2019d be raising all sorts of hell, and I\u2019m amazed that you\u2019re not. Do not let this go!!", "NTA\u2014 the only thing you did wrong was NOT report her to the principal. This is an enormous violation of privacy, and if the behavior continues, could have dangerous consequences for her other students. It baffles me how an educator could be so obtuse", "Nta. She gave your and your children\u2019s personal info to a reporter. Assuming she went to school to be a teacher, confidentially was drilled into her at school. I think you\u2019re under reacting by not pushing this further. She needs to learn her lesson before she keeps breaking confidentiality.", "Holy shit, NTA - though you dropped the ball, big time, by failing to report her. Do you really think your anger is enough of a deterrent to prevent her doing this sort of shit to other parents in the future? She needs to have real repercussions.", "NTA she should be fired. What a breach of privacy and personal data. I'm fucking gobsmacked someone would actually do this and think it was in any way shape or form ok.", "NTA at all. She violated your privacy! That is likely a fireable offense (does someone know for sure?). Maybe you shouldn't have cursed at her but, holy wow! She crossed a major line.\n\nYou are not obligated to be understanding when someone sells you out like that. Just because she's happy for the whole world to know her business doesn't mean everyone is, wow!", "NTA - that\u2019s a breach of data protection. You should lodge an official complaint to the school - even if you don\u2019t care yourself - it may hopefully prevent more data breaches in the future. The staff need to be reminded every now and again, it\u2019s why they have INSET/Training days anyway for stuff like this.\n\nAs to swearing at the teacher, perhaps a bit OTT but given she just exposed your private life to a reporter, who is her friend, is crossing all sorts of boundaries so I can understand your anger. I\u2019d also be livid, particularly if she carried on like it wasn\u2019t a big deal and didn\u2019t grasp what she\u2019d done wrong.", "NTA - She can't do that. If she thought you might be interested, she should have asked you first. It makes sense that the school would want to mediate, but they need to be on the side of the student. It isn't fair to your kids, either", "NTA It doesn't matter if you're gay, trans, disabled, ex convict, genius, single mother, dry alcoholic, retired politician, vegan, or surrogate.\n\nTeachers don't pass your personal information onto reports without permission because they think it would be fun to have your personal details in a magazine.", "WOW, if she lives online then she KNOWS you do not give out childrens information without asking parents FIRST.  She gave someone she is friends with all your kids personal information, that as a teacher is VERY wrong and totally something they are told not to do.\n\nNTA- yeah cussing wasn't the best way but very mild compared to what others might have done in the situation.", "NTA; at this point peruse legal action.", "Nta. For all the Esh votes, because Op yelled at her, need to stfu. He values his privacy. She violated. So yes, he has the right yell.", "NTA. I would be furious", "NTA - that teacher needs to be fired", "She should, and could be fired. She\u2019s literally breaking the law giving out your information and your kids information", "NTA.\n\nYes, you could have refrained from cussing her out BUT she gave your private information, including details about your kids, to someone you don\u2019t know without your permission. That is dangerously dumb on her part.", "NTA \n\nThis is illegal in most states.\nAlso I dont get the behavior of the principale. He needs to take action if one if his teachers gives away personal Infos- not asking the victim for understanding.", "Maybe you could\u2019ve conducted yourself better, but she leaked your personal information out to a reporter without even getting consent from you, so you were absolutely within your rights to be pissed. \n\nAlso, you WERE understanding by not reporting her to the school board. I\u2019m assuming that the VP is being the way he is because one of his duties is to protect his staff. At the very least, he did acknowledge that her actions were way more out of line than yours. And you\u2019re completely right - once your kid is done with that grade, she\u2019s OSOM. \n\nNTA", "You\u2019re a saint... I would have tried suing the school district, on the terms of needing to pull my children out of public school for the simple fact that our rights to privacy were FULLY violated in this situation, and involved 3 minors... \n\nTeach is wayyyyyy outta line, and what she did can\u2019t possibly be legal, or in accordance with the district\u2019s code of conduct... This shid just blew my mind. The audacity to do that without asking your permission!!! Deffffffff NTA! \n\nRespect. Single parenting gets tough and lonely sometimes.", "NTAish - breach of trust in a huge way! The extra comment I get was out of frustration and not the best. \n\nSo as far as the principal\u2019s involvement - does this mean that your kiddo is being treated differently? Or just that she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable talking to you now? Did you ask the principal if he offered her the same advice to be understanding because she breached your trust, shared personal identifiable information with a third party without your consent and that then you reacted in a way that was not great?", "Absolutely NTA. Massive violation of trust and privacy.", "NTA. You need to report this up the chain to someone who will take this seriously - principal, superintendent, school district, etc. \u201cShe did a bad thing but she\u2019s young\u201d is not any kind of acceptable response for a school employee providing students\u2019 personal information to anyone, let alone a personal friend of hers, and the school needs to be bending over backwards to convince you they\u2019re taking this seriously, not scolding you for the language you used upon discovering this **breach of ethics** and possibly of **the law**.", "NTA", "She gave the reporter the names of your KIDS?!? Oh absolutely not. I would ask the vice principal how would you know she hasn\u2019t shared your kids\u2019 full names with other random adults you don\u2019t know!! \n\nIf someone knows where you work and your kids\u2019 full names, they can find out your work schedule and where you live pretty easily. Finding out about a kids\u2019 soccer league or play practice is pretty easy if they have a full name and school for the kid. From there, they can show up and just say \u201cHey [kids full name], your dad had to work late today over at [your workplace] and asked me to pick you up!\u201d And boom, your kid is in extreme danger. She\u2019s lucky all you did was yell and curse a little. I would be losing my mind at the school if I were you. NTA.", "Both of my parents were/are teachers. I heard everything about shitty colleagues behind the scenes for decades. This is blatantly shitty. You need to tell the principal about this. It\u2019s a gross overstepping of boundaries", "NTA - what she did was hugely inappropriate. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the school had some sort of policy in place against the giving out of personal information.", "NTA I\u2019d be contacting a lawyer immediately", "Not sure how are the GDPR laws in your country, but I would check that and threaten them with that.... they leaked your personal information - it is very serious.  \n\n\nEdit: DEFINITELY NTA.  \nI would have done way worse than cussing...", "Are you in the US?\n\nI believe the teacher violated FERPA.  Look up the rules.  The school is in big trouble", "NTA she is lucky you just cussed her out because she should be disciplined for unprofessional behaviour", "If this is the US I\u2019m pretty sure this may be a FERPA violation.", "NTA. Report her. That is an invasion of privacy not only for you but for your son.", "NTA\n\nBut honestly report her report her to school board report her to someone because that is not an OK thing to do for a teacher. What if somebody who meant harm to you or your kids got a hold of that information because she thought it be a great idea and you\u2019d be happy to be online or in a magazine? I\u2019ve seen one too many kidnapping stories from disgruntled noncustodial parents  to think this is OK. And that\u2019s not even getting to the point where she was rightfully chewed out by you and then decided to go tattle on you because she felt you hurt her feelings not OK. \n\n Like I\u2019ve worked with children before, and one of the first things  I was told if somebody calls and ask for information about a child or parent, you don\u2019t give out anything unless they have a very good warrant or the parents have okayed it before hand", "NTA \n\nLet\u2019s count the number of rules, laws about FERPA, and privacy that teacher violated\u2026..  Being young is no excuse", "NTA, she should not be giving out personal info about students and their parents to ANYONE.\n\nthe VP should be extremely concerned.", "NTA\n\nShe violated your privacy and more than likely violated school policy about not giving out any private information to anybody who is not the parent or a valid contact for those children. You had every right to jump down her throat. The vice president is just pissy because now he has to deal with her violating policy and he's very lucky and should be thanking you for not getting a lawyer involved", "NTA. Cussing her out wasn\u2019t great, but she gave up your personal information - and your kids\u2018 - to a third party.

No question.

Your swearing is a minor issue compared to the massive breach of privacy that the teacher committed.
