Now, my gf didn\u2019t see her dad in like half a year and coincidentally she invited him to a caffe she\u2019s working at for lunch the same day.\n\nWhen she ended at work, they went to a bar. I messaged my gf that I needed wine and if she could pick it up for me and how long it would take her to get home. At this point, the meat is out of the freezer and completelly unfrozen so it\u2019d not be good to put it back into the freezer. Despite this, my gf suddenly texts me she\u2019ll not spend the night and that she\u2019d instead rather go to her dad\u2019s place and finally make up with her step-mother.\n\nI asked her if she couldn\u2019t postpone it since I already had everything taken out for this dinner and offered for her dad to join us with the dinner. She eventually stopped communicating, so I decided to come to the bar they were at because it was right behind the corner from where we live because I wasn\u2019t even sure at that point whether I should cook at all, buy the wine, etc.\n\nHer dad told her to stop being unreasonable and that we\u2019d go to our place for the dinner (although he did seem uncomfortable with it at first because they had to catch the last train). I noticed at that point she was visibly drunk. Fast forward to me having spent more than an hour prepping the meal already and her dad having picked his facourite film and watching it. Then suddenly, my gf starts packing and urging her dad to go already, at one point even saying that she won\u2019t go to HIS Place, but she\u2019ll visit her friend instead if the dad doesn\u2019t go ASAP. We then spent the further 15 minutes with me trying to convince her to not be unreasonable, all the while whispering, making her dad uncomfortable.\n\nAfter this, she is already hell-bnt on going and tells her dad to go ASAP. Now, from my point of view, he seemed disappointed with her and they had a chat behind closed doors. As I said, it seemed from my point of view that the dad was disappointed with her behaviour, so I assumed he tried to explain how rude it is to just leave like this for no other reason than getting a drunk compulsion to make up with her step-mom she\u2019s been avoiding for the last couple of years. Then they left.\n\nToday, I find out they were actually talking about ME being rude and pushing her to stay. Her dad is allegedly not very satisfied ith what happened, but I just think it completely rude and inconsiderate from both of them. Am I the asshole? I just don\u2019t see why they couldn\u2019t on meeting again the day after.\n\nEDIT: I was originally invited to the bar as well, I just refused seeing as I knew the food would take a long time to prepare and that my gf told me she wants to eat it. She then U-turned on me all of a sudden saying she probably wouldn\u2019t all of a sudden and stopped responding, that\u2019s why I went to check in to see what the plan was.", "created_utc": 1677413709, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11cflut/aita_for_getting_mad_that_i_spent_my_effort_to/", "score": 131, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You decided to cook without asking if that's what she wants, you then used the pretext of the unasked for pot roast to ask her to change her ongoing plans to accommodate it.

A dinner you made is more important than her reconciliation with her family???\nI get that she didn't communicate well,  but sometimes you have to be understanding as a partner in what sounds like quite an exceptional situation that sounds emotionally difficult and like a big deal for your gf. Its not like she blew you off to go drinking with her buddies.\nYou should probably have just bowed out graciously instead of trying to control everyone in the situation. You could have talked to her later about your feelings.  We can't always predict how things will go and it sounds like her situation with her dad was one where she couldn't have necessarily predicted how it would play out.

How would a normal meal at home be more important than rekindling a relationship with her family she hadn't spoken to in a year. The fact that you think they are comparable exhibits selfishness.", "Based off your comments, it genuinely seems like the two of you aren't compatible in a relationship.

The roast was just the event that pushed everything over the edge. Relationships are work and require communication on both sides  and there was a breakdown somewhere. You're going to work it out or not, but you do need to learn how to talk to each other without playing the blame game or being pushy for it to work.", "Looking at OPs comments, why are you even with her if she CONSTANTLY breaks her promises, gets drunk and yells at strangers, wants to break into someone's house to pee (????). This relationship sounds exhausting. \n\nBased on your post for THIS situation, YTA (ESH, but you the most), and weirdly obsessed over this one meal you can just eat tomorrow, or that night by yourself", "Haha. Really by what you wrote I already guessed they were talking about you. It honestly doesn't matter what you are cooking. She reconnected with her dad and wanted to spend time with him. From your own words you sound very needy and jealous. Clearly you are unable to take a hint\n\nYou easily could of cooked food and had it later, joined them and forget the roast, stick it in the refrigerator for a day or two, I'm sure it would of been fine. \n\nEither way you made a replaceable meal (how much did that cost? $20 $50??) more important then your gf reconnecting with her father. \n\nYTA.", "It\u2019s better the next day anyway.

She clearly had other plans. YTA OP, you were super rude. She was busy.", "Yep, i agree, or cook it anyway & have the extras as leftovers. \n\nIf it's hard for her to make contact with her dad (for a decent reason of course) then when it can happen, everything else needs to make room.", "This.

Then I came there.", "I would say a meal of over $20 that would go bad if I didn\u2019t make it that day is more important than a compulsive alcohol-driven decision to fix everything.

Apart from that, I always tell her it would be nice if they arranged a meeting with her dad, but she never does.", "Yes, he added extra tension to the situation.", "You\u2019re mistaking the order. We agreed on making a dinner. She sent me from the caff\u00e9 to put the meat out of the freezer in advance. The plan was that dad would show up at the caff\u00e9 for a few hours and then the two of us would get home. They instead when to a bar, where she got drunk and decided now was the time to fix their family. (just BTW, a few hours later, she drunkenly asked me when the step-mum would FINALLY die, so I don\u2019t think it really was about the family for her). I was even invited to the bar at first, but I declined because she told me she\u2019d come home for the food, so I went to prepare it.", "It was the other way around. We agreed two days before we agreed to make the roast in the evening. The meeting with her dad was just a stop-by at the caffe she works at, not some kind of reunion, he just came to check in where she works now and come for a coffee.

Seeing as this decision was impulsive and under the influence of alcohol, you might see where I\u2019m going with this. I tell her constantly to meet with her dad, but she never calls him up, so I think it\u2019s a bit unfair to decide that she\u2019ll just go THIS day in particular.", "I didn\u2019t *decide* to cook and use it as a pretense. That was the plan. We planned to go home together and have a dinner but they went to a bar. She even said the plan still stands a couple of times, but then stopped responding.", "Exactly. I tell her quite regularly to make plans with other people and especially her dad, but she never does and then does stuff impulsively bailing on me, justifying it with not having seen the people for a long time even if it\u2019s completely her fault.", "What award?! Look at my post history. My gf cancells plans on a CONSTANT basis and doesn\u2019t communicate at all. Is it that much to want her to stick to a promise for one god damn time?", "Yes.", "Well I\u2019m in a situation where \u201cplans change\u201d every two weeks and it feels extremely disrespectful and I even told her about the problem, she promised she\u2019d try to curb it and make plans in advance.", "Why?", "First off, when we first planned to make the food, I didn\u2019t even know her father would come to visit her. Second off, even after that, her dad visited at 1PM for a chat over a coffee. How should I have known that it\u2019d take until 10PM that he\u2019d stay. And third and most important - the step-mom wasn\u2019t a part of the picture at all. My gf just drunkenly remembered her and decided now\u2019s a great time to fix it. Lastly, she didn\u2019t communicate at all. I didn\u2019t inow if I should make the food in the first place hence why I came to ask her into the bar.", "My girlfriend cancells plans on me literally every second week. Even if it\u2019s important stuff. On Valentine\u2019s, she made me skip my japanese lesson and go home early and then proceeded to ignore me for five hours straight because she wanted to play a game. Similar stuff like this literally happens all the time, that\u2019s why I\u2019m mad this keeps happening even though we talked it through. To add insult to the injury, I mostly don\u2019t even know what is going on right up until the very last moment. What I said is that I don\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t just reschedule, since I\u2019m telling her all the time to spend time with her family.

What were they supposed to do cause a scene in the bar for you to go home? You cornered them into going back to your place. You seem like you can't take no for an answer. You probably just tell her your plans and expect her to go along with them. \n\nAnd pot roast is your specialty? Then you should know it takes hourssssss for a tender pot roast. Were they supposed to sit there for 4 hours and wait for it? You hadn't even started cooking before they came over. They already waited for an hour and you werent don with dinner. Sounds like she was over the fact that you not only manipulated them into coming to tour place but the dinner wasnt even close to being done. So yeahYTA.", "Again.

A mature response to this is to talk through and establish what is and isn\u2019t considered a dedication of time together.

I can not come up with a scenario where my response to some guy she is dating coming and invading our time, to insist she comes to his home for a pot roast, after watching you barrage her with texts and such beforehand, ends nearly as well as what you described. We\u2019d have had some words, you and I, and it would have been a mighty struggle to keep them civil. And I sure as shit wouldn\u2019t be found at the apartment shortly afterwards watching tv.\n\nI take that back. I might go, only to ensure her safety, as she packs a bag and leaves.

It sucks but things come up, that\u2019s life.
