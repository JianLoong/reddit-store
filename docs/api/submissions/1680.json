Follow that advice. These relatives sound like they're just used to getting what they want. Maybe they have never been said 'no' to before. Just keep saying no.

The people dear to her, who are forming her wedding party. It's normal you're not in that group, she barely knows you. \n\nI think the mothers are overly enthusiastic, so they're out of line. Did the bride asked them to plan stuff? Does a bride want/expect the future MIL to plan her shower, wedding etc?

Maybe even go straight to the bride-to-be and tell her directly that you were not actually asked to help out, and you really don't want to help because you would probably make an organizational mess inadvertantly so it would be best that you NOT help out.

Have fun planning!\u201d Says the same thing without being harsh.", "Yep, pretty much.", "You don't have to feel obligated at all, and saying no is fine, but if you want to offer an olive branch to keep the peace, maybe you can offer to take over one job that can be done at home, like making the bridal favours, or making some decoration.\n\nNot that you have to, mind.", "NTA. They're your husband's family members. Have him tell the mom and stepmom to leave you alone.", "NTA: when my brother got married I was not asked as his only sister to be part of the wedding party at all, I wasn't even asked on the Hen do (honestly was so grateful) but had I been asked to help with other things I would have said a straight NO.", "No NTA, especially for your BIL's bridal shower", "I would only say yes because my MIL is an absolute angel and I'd love to help her however I can.\n\nBut very NTA, it's not your \"job\" or a \"normal\" expectation. You were right to use your right to refuse! Good job.", "Yeah stay out of it. If you're not in the wedding party then why should you be expected to do stuff? NTA.", "NTA the bridal party only does it. So keep saying no, maybe add a line I'm not in the bridal or wedding party. Her bridal party will do a great job.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s literally nothing to do with you, get the bridesmaids to help and don\u2019t help at all.", "Part of the benefits/fun/responsibility/unwanted burden of being in the bridal party is helping with the plans for the wedding. That's big reason it's so important to choose the correct people for the bridal party. Definitely NTA. Regular guest don't get all the benefits of being in a bridal party but also don't have to do all the free labor. You're an adult so MIL and step-MIL cannot volunteer you for all this free labor. Maintain your boundaries.", "Good for you for saying \"No\". I have a hard time with it as well. \n\nI certainly wouldn't expect my future SIL to help with planning if they weren't in my wedding party, but I also wouldn't be upset if they had asked me to help with theirs.  I think it's reasonable to ask for family to help. \n\nMy BIL did a backyard wedding and it was planned in 2 weeks. I honestly can't remember if I was ASKED to help, and my in laws did most of it but I did help set up and offered to do what I could. But, that is how that family is.. They help their family with things. \nMy SIL also came to my baby shower early to help set up even though I didn't ask or expect her too. She just assumed she'd be helping. I was thankful, but also felt a little bad because I didn't even attend her baby shower (we were living 1000 miles away at that time)..but again, I think she just saw me as family and wanted to do it. \n\nYou have every right to say no, so NTA. But I do think family often helps or is involved even if not in the bridal party. (Doesn't mean you're obligated to help, but that isn't a reason to not help.)", "NTA It sounds like you were being voluntold and you used that nice shiny spine to avoid being put to work. Good job", "NAH I think they are less asking you to help with preparations and more.. to act as a buffer between the mom and stepmother. I don't see it as a bad thing, it's really a good idea to have someone help to dissolve the possible tensions while they prepare whatever they are doing. Also it can help with the communication. Regardless you are not obliged to say yes.", "\" They all agreed that I was right in saying no and that the bridal party does all of that stuff.\"\n\nYour friends are 100% correct.  The bridal party does that.  NTA\n\n\"My husband even said it was a d!ck move for having me do all this planning and decorating and etc. and not been asked to be in the bridal party.\"\n\nI'm so glad your husband is supporting you in this.  That's a good one.\n\n\"The step mother texted me tonight \"\n\nAre you sure the bride wanted you to do this?  Maybe the step mom is taking it on herself to employ you as a \"sub-contractor\" for her responsibilities?", " *\"No, you are* ***going to be*** *involved and a part of the planning and festivities.\"*  \nIs that a funny way of asking, or is it just me?\n\nNTA", "No is a complete answer. Never get into why's because many see that was a starting point of negotiations. NTA at all. They shouldn't voluntell you either and just assume you're ok with doing work for a party you're not really involved with.", "Do not lift a finger. You are an honored guest at the wedding, not a servant.\n\nNTA\n\nEnjoy the party and DO NOT allow them to exploit you.", "NTA you were voluntold to help with time and probably money. Your step MIL just wants help and not do all the work most likely. You are more than fine by politely declining. She should\u2019ve asked first.", "NTA\n\n\"No thank you\" is 100% a valid and etiquette-correct response.", "nta .... thats the responsibility of the bridal party which you are not a part of", "The people getting married are your husband's brother and his fiance, correct? So your brother by marriage and soon-to-be sister by marriage? NTA because no, you're not required to help. But your rude attitude is not going to help you out in your family life. The SM sounds annoying but honestly you sound worse.", "Aren't parents considered part of the bridal party technically", "Great feedback. Thank you! I enjoyed some of the posters sayings of\u2026 not my circus, not my monkeys. She should have come to me herself if she wanted to ASK me about helping. Something seems absolutely fishy that my step mother in law is saying everyone is getting along, suddenly, and we\u2019re going to be helping plan. I wonder:\nA. Did she even talk to the bride?\nB. Is she WISHING that they all get along because\u2026 my husband just lost his grandma from his mother? So, the step mother in law is making this up?", "I\u2019ll be using that from now on. Thank you \ud83d\ude02", "In the US, it\u2019s traditional for the bridal party to do all the help for the bride. It\u2019s kind of part of the deal when you accept being in the wedding party. I hope that helps! Thank you for the feedback!", "Thank you! Wonderfully said and you definitely got the dynamics right. I\u2019m very happy to attend the shower and the wedding, but to be roped into planning when I don\u2019t even know her well and I\u2019m not in the bridal party\u2026 what??? If she truly told my SMIL that we were going to all plan and decorate and blah blah blah\u2026 that was REAL nice of her to put me in this mess. I will firmly stand my ground. Thank you!", "Simple and true. No is a complete sentence, many have written, and no is an answer. Appreciate the feedback!", "I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you. I\u2019ve only ever been in a bridal party twice and the one was full of so much anxiety. I don\u2019t understand why it has to be so burden-full.", "I like the way you put that! \u201cShe\u2019s not made you part of the team, so there\u2019s no reason for you to play for that team.\u201d Ya darn right!", "For every no I say, I\u2019ll fill a jar of M&M\u2019s and when the sheet hits the fan\u2026 I\u2019ll be popping them back and watching that show for sure \ud83d\ude02", "Yes. Agreed. I am Ukrainian and when my sister got married, my only obligation was from the church to hold a crown over her head for 45 minutes and when it was over, we had dinner and everyone went home lol. It was great.", "It feels SO good to say no\u2026 especially to this sheet show that\u2019s about to happen. Happy to be at the events; noooo problem. I draw the line at: not my problem. Don\u2019t involve me in any sort of drama.", "I wondered that, too. I also wonder if my SMIL offered to be cordial with my MIL and then she involved me.", "\u201cEnjoy being a guest.\u201d I love it. Thank you. As it should be!", "It's funny she is not in the Bridal Party but is requested to work towards it.", "I admire you for saying no politely and firmly. I have a hard time saying no and it is inspiring to read this.\n\nIf they give you a hard time about it, just repeat yourself. They can have you as a guest or not at all. Certainly not as a servant to the bridal party.\n\nNTA", "Agree, I was confused on that as well.  Every wedding I've been to, the maid/matron of honor hosted and organized the shower.", "Was that why they wanted you there, as a buffer between mum & stepmom?", "Who is \"they\"? You sound so beyond dramatic. The literal only person you have spoken to is the stepmother, in one text exchange. You have no idea who, if anyone besides her, actually wants your help or what they want help with. They haven't even had a meeting to discuss it yet. Sounds like you're just locking for a reason to dislike these people. From the very beginning of your post & how you discussed their engagement party, you sound like you don't like them.", "The post doesn\u2019t specifically state that bride to be \u201cexpected\u201d these people to plan the wedding. If she did, yes, that\u2019s not ok. But someone (step mom maybe?) may have volunteered and is now dragging people into her mess?", "Are you sure this forcefulness is even stemming from your future SIL?  I'm wondering if Step-MIL doesn't want your MIL to get more of a say, and vice versa.  Honestly, it sounds like it'll just be a massive power struggle and they'll make everyone else miserable.  I don't envy the fianc\u00e9e at all.  NTA.    \n\n\nre: the Halloween engagement party.  I saw pics of a lovey Halloween wedding.  Everyone wore conventional clothing for the ceremony, but wore costumes to the reception.  The costumes were on the elegant side--cat ears with a long sleek dress, for example.", "Maybe they wanted you to feel included - the MILs\u2026??. And of course you can say no. And although no is a wonderful thing to say,\nit may make sense relationally to say no with some softeners, like\u2026 \u201cthank for inviting me but I don\u2019t enjoy party planning and would rather not participate.\u201d And if you a tot be helpful to them you can say \u201c If there is a task someone else absolutely cannot do and you need my help, I will consider it to support you, depending on my availability\u201d", "Oh boy do those people hate hearing no. She got comfy with you being... well somewhat of a doormat I'm guessing. Or at least a VERY agreeable person, which is their favourite type of people. Expect her to try lil power moves throughout your journey of learning to say no, it WILL annoy the everloving shit out of her and she will probably call you rude/disrespectful but don't give up, you can do it.", ">Are you sure this forcefulness is even stemming from your future SIL?\n\nThe way I read it the SIL wasn't even involved in this discussion.  This is all the step-MIL wanting OP to be involved.", ">Are you sure this forcefulness is even stemming from your future SIL?

OP - don't put yourself into the position of being the tiebreaker - if MIL and Step-MIL disagree - and you're the third vote, you're just going to piss someone off.  I'm probably on reddit too much - but if they dislike each other as much as you say....it could end up being a \"see....OP likes me better as a MIL\" situation.", "I love the positivity of saying no here! I definitely intend to hold my ground on saying no. I\u2019ve been a doormat to many but it ends here."]}
