The people dear to her, who are forming her wedding party. It's normal you're not in that group, she barely knows you. \n\nI think the mothers are overly enthusiastic, so they're out of line.

I feel like weddings in America are so complex and you are obligated to help whether you like it or not just because they are family. Thank you for your reply. Made me feel a lot better!", "Thank you. My husband and I didn\u2019t want to involve anyone when we got married. We felt that since the Mother and Mother in Law do not get along, that we should seriously consider getting married on our own and do a \u201cweddingmoon\u201d where we could enjoy a wedding and a honeymoon and stream our wedding ceremony live on Facebook for those who wanted to watch. I feel like weddings in America are so complex and you are obligated to help whether you like it or not just because they are family. Thank you for your reply. Made me feel a lot better!", "And good for you! That\u2019s wonderful you are still happily married and for so long! You did the right thing making it no frills at your wedding :)", "This was such a thoughtful reply. Thank you for your time and thoroughly explaining each of the points. It truly makes me feel better in the fact that I said no.", "Lol! I would definitely not say that \ud83d\ude02 I would very much say it in a kinder, softer way. Let her know I have anxiety and that I appreciate she wants to include me, but I just mentally cannot handle it.", "How am I being rude for saying no? She\u2019s not going to be my sister in any relation. It doesn\u2019t work like that. My brother-in-law is the only one I\u2019m technically related to. I won\u2019t be, in any way, related to her. I\u2019m confused why you think I\u2019m such a bad person for not wanting to be involved in this? I\u2019m trying to stay AWAY from the drama. Not create nor stir a pot.", "That is very true. I didn\u2019t think about that\u2026 not having to explain my \u201cno.\u201d", "I think your friends were giving you a way to help justify your response, more so if they're being d*cks and didn't ask you to be in the wedding then they shouldn't expect you to bed over backwards to help. Also, NTA.", "This the mother and stepmother of the groom, not the bride.", "I just asked my husband to talk to his brother. (They are currently hanging out right now.) And my brother in law has no idea about what\u2019s going in - in terms of, he hasn\u2019t asked his fianc\u00e9 and doesn\u2019t know in general. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get an answer when my BIL goes home and asks his fianc\u00e9", "Interesting! I definitely still think it\u2019s really uncommon. Especially in OPs case, where parts of the family don\u2019t get along at all.", "Yeah this sort of seems like SMIL wants to be seen as the hero, while basically just project managing while everyone else (I.e. you) does the hard labor. By announcing that \u201ceveryone is getting along\u201d everyone feels pressure to not be the one who rocks the boat and in this case not rocking the boat means doing whatever SMIL says.", "I'm curious, is any of the pressure coming *directly* from fiancee?\n\nLike do you for sure know that she *actually* wanted you to help out or is that just what SMIL and MIL *told* you she wanted?", "I'm sure it happens to lots of people.", "I tend to practice responses to things in advance\u2026 I find it helps a lot with anxiety and I struggle with saying \u201cno\u201d so practice phrases helps me a lot!", "My anxiety and OCD are the reasons I couldn\u2019t stay at my place \ud83d\ude05 I couldn\u2019t stop trying to move things around and my bf eventually had to grab me and make me slow down/stop moving so I wouldn\u2019t go into a full on attack; it all caught up to me when we were trying to sleep at his place and it was bad. I wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone. Sometimes I wish I had told her no and not helped out, but hindsight 20/20, y\u2019know?", "You're welcome,", "You're not rude for saying no. You're rude for the attitude you have. You are so offended that ONE PERSON has told you you're helping with a party. She's probably not even in charge of it! You keep whining in every reply how could you possibly be expected to help, you don't even know the fiance well. This person is going to be your sister. You're going to do holidays with her. She'll be around if/when you have kids. She'll be there with you as you comfort your spouses when their parents die. START TO GET TO KNOW HER. \n\nRefusing to even discuss one tiny thing you may be able to help with comes across as unwelcoming. \"I'm too anxious/busy/sick to be a good planner haha but I can pick up muffins & juice the morning of the shower.\" Then, if they keep pushing, which you have no idea that they will, you hit them with the \"no is a complete sentence\" attitude. \n\nWhat if you were to try to make this lady feel super welcomed into a family you already became a part of? What could that look like? Even if you can't physically help with a party due to anxiety, you can make an effort (and in my opinion should make an effort).", "This is so harsh on the bride for no reason, considering she didn\u2019t even ask and the stepmom was the one demanding it. It\u2019s perfectly normal for parents or family members of the bride to plan the shower with or rather than the bridal party and it\u2019s very common for moms to help out. But all that being said, if OP is not comfortable helping or doesn\u2019t want to then she is well within her rights to say no.", "No, you\u2019re not. I\u2019m curious if she even asked them to plan anything in the first place. I\u2019m very confused why only she is telling me to help when I don\u2019t even know if this is what the fianc\u00e9 wants. I\u2019ve asked my husband to ask his brother. I don\u2019t want to ask my MIL right now because she just lost her mother and doesn\u2019t need to be bothered with something so stupid if it\u2019s not true. She has enough to worry about right now.", "I can\u2019t imagine they even talked in the first place. I think she\u2019s delusional and THINKS they will get along and do all this stuff together. I would ask my MIL but right now I don\u2019t want to bother her with something so stupid because she just lost her mother not too long ago. I\u2019m trying to be there for her during her time of loss and have her not worry about anything right now.", "That\u2019s what I wondered, too\u2026 my husband was thinking the same thing. I\u2019m going to ask my husband to ask his brother if this is even a \u201cthing\u201d or if the SMIL is so delusional that she\u2019s made this planning party up.", "That\u2019s actually a really great way to help yourself with anxiety. I should really try doing that myself! Anxiety is such a strange bugger, but we have to do what\u2019s best for us in order to keep that mental peace. That\u2019s for sure!", "I love that your boyfriend knows exactly when to step in and help you with your anxiety and OCD. I feel that my husband is the exact same way, too. Thankfully, we have someone to help us stop. Breathe. And take a moment to come down from that scary high. You did a wonderful thing by helping. I just wish it wouldn\u2019t have given you that anxiety and all the things that came with it. You were really sweet to do that. I hope she appreciated you very VERY much.", "She cheated on my brother in law multiple times\u2026 she yells at him constantly and berates him. I don\u2019t really consider her family after that.", "I would definitely ask the fianc\u00e9. She may not know the shit storm brewing between her MIL\u2019s. Sounds like SMIL is doing her own thing taking over parts of this wedding planning, I would want to know as a bride so I can shut that crap down.", "It truly is! Best of luck to you OP!", "Oh she does, we\u2019ve talked about the wedding since and she realizes I view it in a completely different light than she does; we also didn\u2019t know each other as much as we do now at that time, so I think she would\u2019ve done things a bit different had she known", "The fact that you actively are enemies with this person should have been included in your post.", "Absolutely. I\u2019ll have my husband ask his brother. That\u2019s what I wondered\u2026 does she even know? And especially, I would want to know, as the fianc\u00e9, about this. I truly hope it wasn\u2019t her.", "Thank you! \u2764\ufe0f", "I just edited it - apologies", "Very true! I definitely don\u2019t need to be put in the middle of something where they both have petty drama between them and I\u2019m just the cushion."]}
