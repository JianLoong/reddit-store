Follow that advice. These relatives sound like they're just used to getting what they want. Maybe they have never been said 'no' to before. Just keep saying no.

The people dear to her, who are forming her wedding party. It's normal you're not in that group, she barely knows you. \n\nI think the mothers are overly enthusiastic, so they're out of line. Did the bride asked them to plan stuff? Does a bride want/expect the future MIL to plan her shower, wedding etc?

Maybe even go straight to the bride-to-be and tell her directly that you were not actually asked to help out, and you really don't want to help because you would probably make an organizational mess inadvertantly so it would be best that you NOT help out.
