Follow that advice. These relatives sound like they're just used to getting what they want. Maybe they have never been said 'no' to before. Just keep saying no. If you need to soften it, you can say you're busy, you're sick, you're going out of town, etc etc. Throw in a 'no thanks!' every now and then. No is a complete sentence, but there are all kinds of fun ways to dress it up.", "NTA\n\nNot your job, not your problem.   You are allowed to say no, and considering you still have an upper respiratory illness going on, you're doing them a favor by not showing up and sharing it.", "NTA.  \u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence. Your SMIL needs to learn to manage her expectations and respect your boundaries. I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to get involved.", "NTA.

Saying no is a complete sentence, especially when people volunteer you for a role without speaking to you first", "NTA\n\nYou aren't in the wedding party, so you have no obligations. This is a wedding where your husband steps in. It's his brother, so he as best man and has a lot to do.\n\nThe future bride has her own family. She has parents, siblings, friends. The people dear to her, who are forming her wedding party. It's normal you're not in that group, she barely knows you. \n\nI think the mothers are overly enthusiastic, so they're out of line. Did the bride asked them to plan stuff? Does a bride want/expect the future MIL to plan her shower, wedding etc? Wouldn't she prefers her family and friends do this? \n\nThe mothers should focus on their side, the groom's side. They can make themselves available for the bride, but shouldn't start planning unless specifically asked to. It's awkward.", "NTA. Wedding planning/decorating falls to the bride and those SHE chooses to help. For all anyone else knows, she has hired a professional wedding planner to take care of all those details so anyone else trying to help would actually only be a hinderance. Also, it should be on the bridal party and any immediate family (siblings/step-siblings, not any family that is or will be related due to marriage) to be voluntold to do anything. Even then, they should be asked and not voluntold (love that word for when I tell someone no and they come back with \"but so-and-so said you would do it!\"). You have said no, so stick to it. Maybe even go straight to the bride-to-be and tell her directly that you were not actually asked to help out, and you really don't want to help because you would probably make an organizational mess inadvertantly so it would be best that you NOT help out. As rude as it may be to go over SMIL head, truth is that the bride is the one who should be managing the helpers.", "NTA - stick to your no and don't let them try to ret-con you into the bridal party to try to force you to help.

Sounds like it's the step MIL not wanting to have to do it alone with the MIL (think I got those dynamics right!)

She\u2019s got one bridesmaid and they\u2019re not me! I said no. She\u2019s not made you part of the team so there\u2019s no reason for you to play for that team.
