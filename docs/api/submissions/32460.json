My middle child Becky is 32 now and she dropped out the third semester when she was in college. She bounced around for a while until she came back at 23 and asked for money to go back.\n\nAt this point we were unsure since she made bad decisions before so we told her we would loan her the amount and she will need to pay us back without interest. We wrote this all down and she signed it.\n\nWell she did really well and got her degree. She is making a good amount, and we have been asking her to pay us back for years. She keep putting it off originally we were just going to take it out of her inheritance but issues came up.\n\nMy husband is not doing well and need medical help, the bills are stacking up. We have talked to her so many times asking her to help and just pay us back. It\u2019s about 100k and if we got in back we could stay afloat. Even getting a 1000 a month with a payment plan will solve some issue.\n\nWe had another conversation about it and she said she\u2019s not paying it back. She just bought a home and she needs to save. At this point I got a consultation with a lawyer and I have a really strong case of wining.\n\nWIBTA if I Sue. Just FYI the relationship is already destroyed in my eyes since she lied and won\u2019t help us at all.\n\nEdit since it was unclear, we paid for everyone first round of college. She agreed to the loan when she want to go back and we didn\u2019t want to waste another 50k if she dropped again. She is paying back her second time at college", "created_utc": 1701875478, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18c61eh/wibta_for_suing_my_child/", "score": 1941, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You said you wrote down the loan when it was made. Did you include terms or a timeline? This is pretty crucial to both the morality and legality of you calling the debt", "NTA. \n\nI am a university student who is somewhat going through what you did with your kids. I have a contract with my grandparents to do my very best in university (doesn\u2019t mean all As, just my very best - but my best is As) and they will pay for my education. \n\nI love them dearly and they love me, but regardless of being family, it is still a contract. If I dropped out and squandered all their money, I would feel extremely awful and remorseful. Even now I think of ways that once I have my dream job how I can pay them back and with interest. \n\nShe\u2019s your child yes, but she\u2019s not a little girl. She\u2019s a grown woman. Her father is sick and she can\u2019t even find it in her heart to give you money, or even just a payment each month? \n\nYeah, sue her. The only issue I\u2019d see here is you having to pay more for a lawyer, and such things can be quite expensive. You will lose the relationship with her, but frankly, her keeping and not paying back a 100k loan and seemingly not offering any help while her father is sick tells me that there is no relationship, at least that\u2019s how your daughter thinks. \n\nIt\u2019s a typical case of a kid who dropped out of college, went back and had their parents pay for it, and turns out to be a spoiled, entitled older person. I hope to never turn out like that, as I quite literally owe my grandparents my life (not just for my college). \n\nAs a child of a loving family and one who is helping them succeed, I would do anything I could to help out my family. She obviously thinks otherwise.", "NTA. You\u2019ll nuke what\u2019s left over if your relationship, but she did that most of the work, knowing her dad is sick and privileging her savings over supporting him. \n\nIf she were struggling, and just out of Uni, I\u2019d be more understanding, but if she\u2019s old enough to buy a house, she\u2019s old enough to pay back a loan. \n\nThe bank would not be so understanding.\n\nDon\u2019t know whether suing is the best way to get the money back. You need to do your homework first.", "NTA. This sounds very much like my personal situation. I have three brothers and my father promised to pay for all of our college careers. I went to college for three years, dicked around and wasted my time, then ended up dropping out. After a stint in the Navy and some growing up I went back to college. My dad helped out but this time it was in the way of a loan since I'd wasted the money that he gave me the first time. Having lived through that myself I would say one of the best thing my dad did for me as a parent was teach me that my actions have consequences and that I have to deal with said consequences. Part of that was making me pay back the money he loaned me for my second time around in college. And you have a more urgent reason to hold her to her word, you NEED the money for medical bills. If she's in a good financial situation she should be offering to help even if she didn't owe you money from a loan.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter took a loan from you, signed paperwork indicating it was an interest free loan and then decided not to repay it.

Yes she agreed to the debt, which you needed to incentivize her to take things seriously the 2nd time around. But seeing as she buckled down and your other kids got 4 years of tuition paid for, it\u2019s only fair that you pay for 4 years for her aswell. \n\nYou should decrease her debt and she should pay you what\u2019s owed, but not $100k. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t tell you to kick rocks if the amount you were asking her to repay was a fair amount.", "NTA for one tiny detail: *she agreed on the conditions.*\n\nShe agreed she would pay it back and now says she won't pay it back while you need it for medical reasons. \n\nI can't get behind people saying you are the a h for not wanting tl waste 50k, which is a lot of money - let alone waste 100k ... We're not talking about a couple hundreds or alike, this is a huge amount of money that she *knew* she had to pay back - as she agreed on it upfront. She could have said no, but it reads like she simply used you for the money....", "NTA.  She signed a contract.  Hopefully, there was an payment plan amount and schedule included in the document because she could also argue that she'll pay it at some nebulous point in the future or even when she's dead (out of her estate).\n\nI also hope you cleared this no-interest loan with your tax accountant beforehand because from what I know about loans to family, if you don't charge the federally mandated minimum interest (which is almost always below 2%), federally it's considered a gift that you probably needed to pay gift tax on.  That also depends on how much the total running loan amount is.  \n\nHow do I know this?  My parents' plan was that they would use their credit rating to take out loans for the EFC and they would make payments while we were in school, but that we were responsible for paying the loans back after graduation.  There is a large spread in our ages, so this was a lot easier for me in the late 90s then it was for my youngest sister in the 2010s.  Interest rates also swing, so my youngest sister needed some interest rate relief.  I was able to help, so I've loaned her money to pay off 6-9% bank loans with 1-2% personal loans.", "Info: did you spend more on her education than you did on the other kids? Did you just make her promise to pay it back because she took a few years off from school?", "NTA sounds like you really have nothing to lose.  Your own child stiffing their parents is abominable!", "\"Even $1000 a month\" that's a ton of money.", "I'm confused - first time around you only paid for 3 semesters, not 4 years which you presumably paid for your other kids.  So, to treat her like the other kids, you \"owe\" her 5 more semesters.  I can understand not wanting to fund the original 3 semesters again (though she must of had some credits she could still use).  I also understand your hesitation about funding her again and thus the loan.  However, once she graduated, you should have forgiven the portion of the loan that covered the 5 semesters, since you didn't make your other kids pay.  \n\nYou could ask Becky to repay anything above and beyond the 5 semesters.  You could also forgive all or a portion of that in recognition that she was young, made bad decisions, but got her act together, but that is a parenting choice.\n\nSeems interesting that you don't seem to care about every having a relationship with your daughter, I wonder if this is what lead to the bad decisions that she made.", "I'm still not clear on your situation. What's \"first round\"? It sounds like you gave less money to Becky because she dropped out, then gave the balance to her when she started again? So the other two kids got the full amount and Becky got the full amount in two separate deals, the second of which was a loan?\n\nIf that's the case you should forgive the loan and ask all your kids for an equal or equivalent (depending on circumstances) contribution to Dad's health.", ">She keep putting it off originally we were just going to take it out of her inheritance but issues came up. My husband is not doing well and need medical help, the bills are stacking up. We have talked to her so many times asking her to help and just pay us back. It\u2019s about 100k and if we got in back we could stay afloat. Even getting a 1000 a month with a payment plan will solve some issue.\n\nINFO: Hold up. There *is* still an inheritance despite you being out 100k? Or are you saying what would have been the inheritance is already eaten by medical bills?\n\nINFO: how were the other childrens' educations handled? Because if you paid for theirs, this is really just trying to punish her for dropping out in the third semester. And if that's the situation, the proper recourse would be to ask her for *the cost of those three semesters*, and not the cost of all four years; if that's the situation, you're actually the ones in the moral wrong because you paid for all four years of the other children, presumably because they didn't drop out and then go back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt any rate, you certainly *can* sue a child. Though be ready for that kind of thing to go viral. I mean you *are* talking about suing your daughter out of her new house and directly onto the street, because of all the lawyer fees on top of the 100k. You don't mention if she has children, but if she does, you'll look \\*EVEN BETTER\\* in the media when you sue her. So yeah, it'll go viral. Then Fox will abuse it for its own ends, probably blasting out stories about how this is an example of liberal thought ruining the younger generation and making it entitled. I can see the memes already. On and on and on.\n\nSo you do you, but just be ready for media to take notice and/or for her to take it to the media. After all, she's gonna need more money for the lawyer, and appearances (or even a book \"my story: sued by my parents\") on talk shows can bring in some.\n\nThough, I suppose an actual lawsuit might prompt her to settle it in exchange for a repayment plan. I don't know. You do you.", "INFO\n\nIn total how much did you spend on the education of each kid?", "NTA. Your child agreed to the terms, and signed a note. If she's not willing to voluntarily do it, suing her might put her on the path to making good on her promise.

I understand wanting to secure the investment, since Becky already dropped out once, but that doesn't change the fact that you're asking Becky to pay you back $100k that your other children were given free and clear.\n\nit probably has a lot to do with why Becky doesn't feel obligated to live up to the deal she agreed to, since you're not living up to the deal you offered either.\n\nThat being said, she did agree to the loan terms, and neither wrong justifies the other, so you're both ESH", "NTA, but I see a lot of Y T A.  I know there's a big push on reddit that kids don't owe their parents anything and I agree to a degree but there's not obligated and then there's the flip of hey, if it came down to your parent in need would you help your parent if you could.  Becky obviously had the means when OP started asking, then she bought a home.  \n\n\nMy parents paid for my college no questions asked, I had a scholarship so it was only for incidentals a 5th year.  They paid for my brother's out of state schooling(he eventually paid them back, but they didn't expect him to) and they paid for my sisters 2 tries to get through college.

In reality you should have made her responsible for the first year to prove she was going to stick to it", "Maybe she just thought the contract was incentive to not drop out again and thought she was entitled to the same treatment her siblings got. And in my opinion, she should be.\n\nESH - Everyone sucks here. You have the right to demand payment back but it's super shitty. If you're demanding payment back, she should make some kind of effort - but also if it was me I would cut you out of my life for treating me so differently from my siblings. The only thing you'd ever hear from me again is a minimum monthly payment.", "Did you spend the same amount on all the kids?", "**OP - I know you had an agreement, but maybe you should be asking for the wasted money back instead.** I know it's not as much as what you need, but it might be more palatable to her and make more sense, bc ultimately she did buckle down and do what was expected of her.\n\nSo frame it as, \"We are so glad that we were able to help you get a degree and thus a great job w/o any debt, like we did the other kids, but there's the matter of the wasted semesters. We didn't do that for any of the other ones, and because we went over and above - we kinda need that money back. It's not fair to us.\" Maybe nicer than that - but you get the idea.\n\nSince she hasn't paid any in 4+ years, she might just be selfish and that rationale won't help.

Before you do this though, I think you need to get ahead of the game and inform her siblings of what you are doing and why. That way 1) she can\u2019t spin a sob story with her as the victim 2) maybe in the interim during your legal battle your other children can assist you financially given the circumstances so medical needs don\u2019t go unmet and compound.

We have talked to her so many times asking her to help and just pay us back. It\u2019s about 100k and if we got in back we could stay afloat.

Basically, if she doesn\u2019t pay, then you can drag her back in front of the judge, the judge can order her to pay again, perhaps even hold her in contempt, but if she doesn\u2019t pay, the government can\u2019t just take the money from her and hand it over to you. She owns a house, so that\u2019s good, as you can go ahead and slap a lien on it in lieu of her defaulted judgment (should it come to that). Even so, that will only help you if she wants to sell the house or refinance her mortgage. If she has no need to do those things, the lien won\u2019t get you your money.\n\nYou should still sue her (and I say this with all possible impetus), but you need to understand that a cut and dry case with a quick judgment does not always translate to a quick payout. In the meantime, you should probably explore alternate ways (like a bank loan) to fund your husband\u2019s care so that you aren\u2019t waiting for her compliance. Furthermore, you should talk to your lawyer about seeking a judgment which puts her on the hook for their legal fees, as well as any interest you might accrue against any loans you\u2019ve taken out for your husband\u2019s medical bills. Also, given that your need for this repayment isn\u2019t just a point of law or pride, but rather a literal matter of life and death, you should explore the threshold for punitive damages. Also, if your lawyer hasn\u2019t advised you about these realities of civil court, you should consider talking to another lawyer. A lawyer shouldn\u2019t encourage you to pay them for their services without advising you about the possibility that you could win and still not get the money you are owed.", "Info:  with the stopping and starting of college did you wind up paying more or the same amount?\n\nMeaning if she had never dropped out would the amount of money you spent be the same or by dripping out and going back you actually had to pay more money?", "I feel for you.

I'm trying to clarify one key point:\n\nYou're saying in some comments that your husband is dying and there's no way he can survive without the $1k/month payments. Yet... you do have a high value home and other retirement funds. So... If your daughter doesn't pay you back, you're saying that he's going to die - but you won't take money out of your retirement fund to save his life?\n\nIf he's truly sick and will die without the extra money, I would encourage you to focus on him getting better and figure out a way to get a second mortgage against your home. You can also borrow against your retirement fund. I would also encourage you to get some kind of therapy to work through your anger. \n\nWhat is the point of spending money on lawyers fees and the stress of court for money you will likely never get back?

Taking all of your stress out on her and the money you loaned her 10 years ago. \n\nYour daughter is also an asshole for not helping out with anything at all. She should pay you back, even if she could only pay $200/month, it would be a token of trying to make things right.

Not the part where they have to keep up good grades etc., the part where if there's a gap in the process you won't pay for the second half. Why was it so important to you that they graduate at 22 instead of 26? How rigid did you plan to be about this, and was that clear in the contract you signed? If she'd dropped out for one semester would you have made her pay for the rest? What if she just dropped one class? What if she changed majors and took longer than 4 years? What about transferring? If all of this was concerning to you, why not just agree to pay for 4 years of college contingent upon graduation?\n\nGaps in higher education are very common. People get overwhelmed, aren't quite mature enough yet, don't fully realize how an education benefits them, can't decide on a major, have trouble making friends, get depressed, have a bad experience with a professor, get sexually assaulted, etc. etc. etc. When you love someone you have empathy for them and provide support wherever you can. That's easy when you agree with their decisions, but sometimes loving people can be difficult too. This is particularly true for teenagers because they look and speak much more like adults than children, but the part of their brain that helps them make good and rational decisions (the prefrontal cortex) won't finish developing until their mid 20s.\n\nIt certainly sounds like you have a cut and dry case, but it also sounds like you're holding a pretty massive grudge over some decisions your daughter made when she was 19 or so. You'll win in court, but I really hope you understand just how nuclear this option might end up being. You will very likely never see or speak to your daughter again. Depending on who takes what side, you may damage relationships between you (or her) and your other children as well. You might end up with grandchildren that you never meet.

College credit doesn't expire. \n\nSecond, the contract as it was described seems a bit harsh. Requiring her to pay it back even if she finished school still treats her differently from the other two kids. They finished, they didn't have to pay anything back. She finished, it seems unfair she should have to pay it all back, including the initial sum you paid for her. \n\nBasically, you have two kids that got a free ride, and a third kid that has a massive $100k debt over her head just because she wasn't mentally ready for college yet, which I do not blame her for.

I wonder if middle daughter is the disfavoured child\u2026", "Classy, calling an elderly woman with a dying husband an ah. It\u2019s was a mutually agreed upon LOAN", "Three years? Check your SOL. I\u2019m sure the lawyer thought of that, but any lawyer that tries to sell you on a \u201cquick case\u201d is just being a salesman.\n\nIn some states, a 3 year old debt may not even be collectable in court.", "Your attorney should have explained to you that there is a big difference between getting a judgment against someone and actually recovering any money from an individual.  You should ask them to explain it to you.  Any chance this attorney works by the hour, and not based on contingency of recovery?\n\nYou might be able to get a judgement but forcing someone to actually pay is a different story.", "I can't believe people are skipping the part where they're going to sue because dad is sick and drowning in medical debt.

Especially the way OP thinks that 1k a month is reasonable for installments. My husband and I both work and we couldn't make that payment.  I really think OP is throwing numbers around the wishing well, hoping Becky will just give in.", "This is literally the *exact* reason I dropped out of college for a while. And then I went back and finished too. OP definitely left out a crucial part of the story (which isnt our business or necessarily hers to share) but I cant understand why they wouldnt just forgive her loan? Doesnt it speak to Becky's tenacity that she went back and finished? Being a nontraditional student in undergrad can be a very lonely journey and she did it, that should have made the parents *extra* proud, instead, they try to nickel and dime her. If they wouldve forgiven it immediately, this ask for financial help would possibly be met with more compassion and willingness to be involved. I feel for their situation of bills and medical issues, but also think there are some messed up family dynamics that have contributed to this escalation. \n\nParents are parents forever, no matter how old the kids get. I cannot imagine putting my child (and their spouse/possible children) into certain financial ruin for ANY reason, ever. OP is TA.", "OP said they own \"an expensive home in today's market\", which suggests they could sell it, buy a smaller house or condo to live in, and use the difference from the downgrade to pay medical bills.\n\nAdditionally, before putting it on the market they could talk to the other two children and let them know that because the one kid won't start paying the debt back, this is their only option, which would both create a opportunity for the other siblings to pressure the one that owes, and if the sale does not result in enough difference to keep afloat, have set expectations on why they would have to sue if that ends up being unavoidable.\n\nThey can also just sue, like I already said they have the right to, it just means they should assume they are giving up access to all current and future grandkids from that kid in the process, because lawsuits are the kind of thing that burns bridges in families.\n\nIt's down to choices and priorities.", "Come on, it's a mother/father and child.

It's a step short of actually suing her, and it can clue her in that this is serious business and she can't just blow you off.

If she truly loved and respected you, she would be working on paying back the loan.  \n\nMy aunt and uncle loaned me the initial financing for my house.  I paid them back in full, *with interest* in about a year.  Why?  Because even though they weren't hurting for money, I would never take advantage of them like that, because I love and respect them.  That you need the money, only makes your daughter's actions worse.\n\nIf you want to give her the benefit of a doubt, have your attorney send her a warning letter, they can even expressly include the why (though it isn't necessary).

I never expect my mom to come to me and say oh never mind you don\u2019t need to pay back the money and it\u2019s a significant amount of money. It\u2019ll take me about 3 1/2 years to pay her off if I keep up this payment schedule and I also just bought a house so it\u2019s doable. She owes you the money she signed the contract if she\u2019s not willing to pay it back by all means, take her to court. It\u2019s not OK for her to say I\u2019m not gonna pay you back especially now that you guys have medical bills because your husband is sick. She should be wanting to help you.", "Dave Ramsay says never loan money- just give. I think you may just need to have a conversation with her about your husbands medical bills and that if she is able to start making payment it would help significantly. I do think this can start a lot of unwanted drama in the family and this is such a tricky situation. I\u2019d probably just mention things being right and bills piling to see if she may even openly say something- lastly I\u2019d negotiate all bills with medical. This is not just money- it\u2019s the relationship with your family, her siblings, and so much. Money can ruin everything.", "Sue her entitled selfish child and make sure you draft a solid ironclad will to prevent her from getting anything before you pass, but  still leave her with a little so she won't contest it or be unable to.", "You're incredible!", "A verbal contract can be legally binding, so the fact that it wasn\u2019t notarized is irrelevant. The context of the post also leads me to believe that there is written communication wherein Becky acknowledged the agreement and yet is refusing to uphold her end, which would only further serve to prove that this document would hold up in court. \n\nImplying that Becky going back to college on her parents\u2019 dime was the only way she could have gotten her life \u201cback together\u201d is an insult to anyone who persevered and became a self-sufficient adult without a free ride to a college degree, in my opinion. If she felt like that was her only way, student loans are absolutely a thing, and given that she was 23 when she decided to go back means she was more than well aware of that and was preying on her parents\u2019 generosity. \n\nIn OPs defense (and this isn\u2019t in response to your comment specifically), just because OP had the ability to pay for their kids\u2019 college educations at one point in time doesn\u2019t mean that their financial situation would remain static four years later while Becky chose to not appreciate the financial investment/burden that is modern day higher education.\n\nEdit: grammar", "Yeah if she\u2019s just bought a house, she is VERY unlikely to have a spare $1000 a month in her budget to send to her parents.", "It\u2019s an example.

You said you pulled it from your accounts, meaning you had $100k on hand 10 years ago and now you're going to be homeless? \n\nI'm not saying your daughter isn't wrong, but there is an awful lot of hate and hyperbole in your words that is making me think this goes way deeper than just the college money.", "How is that an analogous situation?
