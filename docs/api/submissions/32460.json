My middle child Becky is 32 now and she dropped out the third semester when she was in college. She bounced around for a while until she came back at 23 and asked for money to go back.\n\nAt this point we were unsure since she made bad decisions before so we told her we would loan her the amount and she will need to pay us back without interest. We wrote this all down and she signed it.\n\nWell she did really well and got her degree. She is making a good amount, and we have been asking her to pay us back for years. She keep putting it off originally we were just going to take it out of her inheritance but issues came up.\n\nMy husband is not doing well and need medical help, the bills are stacking up. We have talked to her so many times asking her to help and just pay us back. It\u2019s about 100k and if we got in back we could stay afloat. Even getting a 1000 a month with a payment plan will solve some issue.\n\nWe had another conversation about it and she said she\u2019s not paying it back. She just bought a home and she needs to save. At this point I got a consultation with a lawyer and I have a really strong case of wining.\n\nWIBTA if I Sue. Just FYI the relationship is already destroyed in my eyes since she lied and won\u2019t help us at all.\n\nEdit since it was unclear, we paid for everyone first round of college. She agreed to the loan when she want to go back and we didn\u2019t want to waste another 50k if she dropped again. She is paying back her second time at college", "created_utc": 1701875478, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18c61eh/wibta_for_suing_my_child/", "score": 409, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You said you wrote down the loan when it was made. Did you include terms or a timeline? This is pretty crucial to both the morality and legality of you calling the debt", "NTA. \n\nI am a university student who is somewhat going through what you did with your kids. I have a contract with my grandparents to do my very best in university (doesn\u2019t mean all As, just my very best - but my best is As) and they will pay for my education. \n\nI love them dearly and they love me, but regardless of being family, it is still a contract. If I dropped out and squandered all their money, I would feel extremely awful and remorseful. Even now I think of ways that once I have my dream job how I can pay them back and with interest. \n\nShe\u2019s your child yes, but she\u2019s not a little girl. She\u2019s a grown woman. Her father is sick and she can\u2019t even find it in her heart to give you money, or even just a payment each month? \n\nYeah, sue her. The only issue I\u2019d see here is you having to pay more for a lawyer, and such things can be quite expensive. You will lose the relationship with her, but frankly, her keeping and not paying back a 100k loan and seemingly not offering any help while her father is sick tells me that there is no relationship, at least that\u2019s how your daughter thinks. \n\nIt\u2019s a typical case of a kid who dropped out of college, went back and had their parents pay for it, and turns out to be a spoiled, entitled older person. I hope to never turn out like that, as I quite literally owe my grandparents my life (not just for my college). \n\nAs a child of a loving family and one who is helping them succeed, I would do anything I could to help out my family. She obviously thinks otherwise.", "NTA. You\u2019ll nuke what\u2019s left over if your relationship, but she did that most of the work, knowing her dad is sick and privileging her savings over supporting him. \n\nIf she were struggling, and just out of Uni, I\u2019d be more understanding, but if she\u2019s old enough to buy a house, she\u2019s old enough to pay back a loan. \n\nThe bank would not be so understanding.\n\nDon\u2019t know whether suing is the best way to get the money back. You need to do your homework first.", "NTA. This sounds very much like my personal situation. I have three brothers and my father promised to pay for all of our college careers. I went to college for three years, dicked around and wasted my time, then ended up dropping out. After a stint in the Navy and some growing up I went back to college. My dad helped out but this time it was in the way of a loan since I'd wasted the money that he gave me the first time. Having lived through that myself I would say one of the best thing my dad did for me as a parent was teach me that my actions have consequences and that I have to deal with said consequences. Part of that was making me pay back the money he loaned me for my second time around in college. And you have a more urgent reason to hold her to her word, you NEED the money for medical bills. If she's in a good financial situation she should be offering to help even if she didn't owe you money from a loan.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter took a loan from you, signed paperwork indicating it was an interest free loan and then decided not to repay it.

Yes she agreed to the debt, which you needed to incentivize her to take things seriously the 2nd time around. But seeing as she buckled down and your other kids got 4 years of tuition paid for, it\u2019s only fair that you pay for 4 years for her aswell. \n\nYou should decrease her debt and she should pay you what\u2019s owed, but not $100k. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t tell you to kick rocks if the amount you were asking her to repay was a fair amount.", "NTA for one tiny detail: *she agreed on the conditions.*\n\nShe agreed she would pay it back and now says she won't pay it back while you need it for medical reasons. \n\nI can't get behind people saying you are the a h for not wanting tl waste 50k, which is a lot of money - let alone waste 100k ... We're not talking about a couple hundreds or alike, this is a huge amount of money that she *knew* she had to pay back - as she agreed on it upfront. She could have said no, but it reads like she simply used you for the money....", "NTA.  She signed a contract.  Hopefully, there was an payment plan amount and schedule included in the document because she could also argue that she'll pay it at some nebulous point in the future or even when she's dead (out of her estate).\n\nI also hope you cleared this no-interest loan with your tax accountant beforehand because from what I know about loans to family, if you don't charge the federally mandated minimum interest (which is almost always below 2%), federally it's considered a gift that you probably needed to pay gift tax on.  That also depends on how much the total running loan amount is.  \n\nHow do I know this?  My parents' plan was that they would use their credit rating to take out loans for the EFC and they would make payments while we were in school, but that we were responsible for paying the loans back after graduation.  There is a large spread in our ages, so this was a lot easier for me in the late 90s then it was for my youngest sister in the 2010s.  Interest rates also swing, so my youngest sister needed some interest rate relief.  I was able to help, so I've loaned her money to pay off 6-9% bank loans with 1-2% personal loans.", "Info: did you spend more on her education than you did on the other kids? Did you just make her promise to pay it back because she took a few years off from school?", "NTA sounds like you really have nothing to lose.  Your own child stiffing their parents is abominable!", "\"Even $1000 a month\" that's a ton of money.", "I'm confused - first time around you only paid for 3 semesters, not 4 years which you presumably paid for your other kids.  So, to treat her like the other kids, you \"owe\" her 5 more semesters.  I can understand not wanting to fund the original 3 semesters again (though she must of had some credits she could still use).  I also understand your hesitation about funding her again and thus the loan.  However, once she graduated, you should have forgiven the portion of the loan that covered the 5 semesters, since you didn't make your other kids pay.  \n\nYou could ask Becky to repay anything above and beyond the 5 semesters.  You could also forgive all or a portion of that in recognition that she was young, made bad decisions, but got her act together, but that is a parenting choice.\n\nSeems interesting that you don't seem to care about every having a relationship with your daughter, I wonder if this is what lead to the bad decisions that she made.", "I'm still not clear on your situation. What's \"first round\"? It sounds like you gave less money to Becky because she dropped out, then gave the balance to her when she started again? So the other two kids got the full amount and Becky got the full amount in two separate deals, the second of which was a loan?\n\nIf that's the case you should forgive the loan and ask all your kids for an equal or equivalent (depending on circumstances) contribution to Dad's health.", ">She keep putting it off originally we were just going to take it out of her inheritance but issues came up. My husband is not doing well and need medical help, the bills are stacking up. We have talked to her so many times asking her to help and just pay us back. It\u2019s about 100k and if we got in back we could stay afloat. Even getting a 1000 a month with a payment plan will solve some issue.\n\nINFO: Hold up. There *is* still an inheritance despite you being out 100k? Or are you saying what would have been the inheritance is already eaten by medical bills?\n\nINFO: how were the other childrens' educations handled? Because if you paid for theirs, this is really just trying to punish her for dropping out in the third semester. And if that's the situation, the proper recourse would be to ask her for *the cost of those three semesters*, and not the cost of all four years; if that's the situation, you're actually the ones in the moral wrong because you paid for all four years of the other children, presumably because they didn't drop out and then go back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt any rate, you certainly *can* sue a child. Though be ready for that kind of thing to go viral. I mean you *are* talking about suing your daughter out of her new house and directly onto the street, because of all the lawyer fees on top of the 100k. You don't mention if she has children, but if she does, you'll look \\*EVEN BETTER\\* in the media when you sue her. So yeah, it'll go viral. Then Fox will abuse it for its own ends, probably blasting out stories about how this is an example of liberal thought ruining the younger generation and making it entitled. I can see the memes already. On and on and on.\n\nSo you do you, but just be ready for media to take notice and/or for her to take it to the media. After all, she's gonna need more money for the lawyer, and appearances (or even a book \"my story: sued by my parents\") on talk shows can bring in some.\n\nThough, I suppose an actual lawsuit might prompt her to settle it in exchange for a repayment plan. I don't know. You do you.", "INFO\n\nIn total how much did you spend on the education of each kid?", "NTA. Your child agreed to the terms, and signed a note. If she's not willing to voluntarily do it, suing her might put her on the path to making good on her promise. It's too bad it has come to this, but it seems the best and only recourse for you and your husband.", "ESH and I'll explain why\n\nYou paid for 4 years of college for your other children, and only 3 semesters for Becky.  I understand wanting to secure the investment, since Becky already dropped out once, but that doesn't change the fact that you're asking Becky to pay you back $100k that your other children were given free and clear.\n\nit probably has a lot to do with why Becky doesn't feel obligated to live up to the deal she agreed to, since you're not living up to the deal you offered either.\n\nThat being said, she did agree to the loan terms, and neither wrong justifies the other, so you're both ESH", "NTA, but I see a lot of Y T A.  I know there's a big push on reddit that kids don't owe their parents anything and I agree to a degree but there's not obligated and then there's the flip of hey, if it came down to your parent in need would you help your parent if you could.  Becky obviously had the means when OP started asking, then she bought a home.  \n\n\nMy parents paid for my college no questions asked, I had a scholarship so it was only for incidentals a 5th year.  They paid for my brother's out of state schooling(he eventually paid them back, but they didn't expect him to) and they paid for my sisters 2 tries to get through college.

Unless you paid for a full four years for the kids then didn't pay for your daughter passed the first year. In reality you should have made her responsible for the first year to prove she was going to stick to it", "Maybe she just thought the contract was incentive to not drop out again and thought she was entitled to the same treatment her siblings got. And in my opinion, she should be.\n\nESH - Everyone sucks here. You have the right to demand payment back but it's super shitty. If you're demanding payment back, she should make some kind of effort - but also if it was me I would cut you out of my life for treating me so differently from my siblings. The only thing you'd ever hear from me again is a minimum monthly payment.", "Did you spend the same amount on all the kids?", "**OP - I know you had an agreement, but maybe you should be asking for the wasted money back instead.** I know it's not as much as what you need, but it might be more palatable to her and make more sense, bc ultimately she did buckle down and do what was expected of her.\n\nSo frame it as, \"We are so glad that we were able to help you get a degree and thus a great job w/o any debt, like we did the other kids, but there's the matter of the wasted semesters. We didn't do that for any of the other ones, and because we went over and above - we kinda need that money back. It's not fair to us.\" Maybe nicer than that - but you get the idea.\n\nSince she hasn't paid any in 4+ years, she might just be selfish and that rationale won't help. But give it this one shot before you sue.", "Did you pay for your other kids educations?", "No, you're NTA here.  You made a contract with a 32 year old person who is breaking their end of the deal.

More realistic, no?", "YTA your daughter wasn\u2019t mature enough for college initially so once she grew up she went to school and did very well.

But you paid for your other two kids educations but charged your middle because they struggled a bit? You clearly did not need to pay at all but you made your support contingent, and that makes you an AH. She should have never agreed to this loan, a loan you should have never offered. And suing her is not the answer. \n\n*Info - this is a question for a lawyer and/or your therapist.*\n\n*I mean sure, if someone signs an agreement to pay you back, they should pay.

The fact that she won\u2019t even pay back the loan to save her ailing father is really all I needed to know.

Normally I\u2019d advise not to burn bridges since you might need help when you\u2019re older, but it\u2019s obvious she won\u2019t lift a finger then either. Before you do this though, I think you need to get ahead of the game and inform her siblings of what you are doing and why. That way 1) she can\u2019t spin a sob story with her as the victim 2) maybe in the interim during your legal battle your other children can assist you financially given the circumstances so medical needs don\u2019t go unmet and compound.
