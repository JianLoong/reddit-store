We've been best friends for over 16 years, and she means the world to me. Since I'm not an extroverted person, the people I know are mostly the people I met through Sarah. Sadly, she's been battling cancer for the last three years and undergoing chemotherapy for it.\n\nShe met her boyfriend on a dating app, soon became close and started dating. Me and Sarah's other friends had never liked him since we first met him. I'm sure at least some of y'all have seen the cartoon \"Courage the Cowardly Dog\" before. I was getting the same creepy vibes I got from the old man there. I'm not joking. Nevertheless, my friend was happier than ever, and I didn't want to spoil her happiness because I knew the difficulties she was going through. \n\nAnyway, some time ago, she was hospitalized because her condition suddenly worsened. In the beginning, her boyfriend often stopped by and brought her flowers. But after a while, his visits began to become infrequent. Eventually, he started visiting once a week. I know the whole process because I was always with her. I slept next to her in the hospital several times a week. Her parents came to visit her whenever they could but couldn't stay with her all the time since they both had 9-5 jobs.\n\nI often missed events at work/school but didn't care. I didn't want her to feel alone. She helped me through my worst times, \u2013if you look at my first post which is about crying, you'll understand what I'm talking about. I knew that no matter what I did, I wouldn't be able to help her as much as she did. The best I could do was not to make her feel lonely. I couldn't relieve her pain, but at least I could make her smile. \n\nWeeks passed, and we found out that Sarah's boyfriend was cheating on her with multiple girls. He also made an inappropriate request to a girl from Sarah's friend group. Then, even though he knew I was staying with Sarah, he started messaging me from my social media accounts, making inappropriate comments. When I snapped back at him and got into an argument about how he was so inconsiderate and selfish for doing this to Sarah, he told me that I was a \"miserable girl with daddy issues\" and no one would believe me even if I told them about this because I was \"an f'ing psycho anyway.\" \n\nWell, that hurt. I knew he was saying that just to be mean, but I also knew it was true. Yet I didn't want to make the whole thing about myself, so I didn't say anything not to cause any more drama. Later on, without discussing this with any of her friends, I told Sarah about the whole thing because I didn't want her to live a lie. She deserved to know the truth. But now everyone's mad at me and doesn't talk to me, including her family members, because I \"took her only happiness away from her.\" \n\nI don't know what to do or what to say.

I can\u2019t imagine a crappier situation. Setting aside my personal beliefs that someone\u2019s happiness should never solely rely on a partner, it is obvious her happiness with him was on a limited time frame. She was most likely going to find out about his infidelity sooner or later. Just imagine the feeling of betrayal she\u2019d have if she found out that not only was her boyfriend cheating on her, but her friends were his some of his targets and never said anything. \n\nThe way people treat terminally ill people is downright dehumanizing sometimes. People would rather the individual be disrespected in order to maintain a false sense of comfort. You were the only one who treated Sarah with respect, honesty, and humanity.\n\nTo bring you some comfort after her loved ones\u2019 cruel words, it\u2019s very evident you and Sarah are close and your support of her is far more valuable than some a**hat\u2019s fake love. I would argue you bring her just as much happiness through your constant support.", "He is TA, not you.

That's all that matters.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't take her happiness from her, he did.  \nShe's hurt, yes, and this news can hit people like a truck, but it's so often forgotten that you \"don't shoot the messenger\" in these situations.  \nYou were looking out for her best interests.

The only question is when.\n\nWhen she is hospitalized, and he isn\u2019t coming around to visit, would not be when I choose.", "NTA.

Lying to a person simply because she is ill makes them complicit in this man's poor behavior.  Do they not believe that she deserves so much better than that?  And if they are intimate, STDS!  She cannot afford to get any!  And she is not living a lie, she's living surrounded by people afraid to tell her the truth.", "NTA  Sarah needs to know this info and what a horrible boyfriend she had.", "NTA.

No doubt about it. \n\nEven if your friend isn't terminally ill, I don't know if it is best to give a hospitalized cancer patient, who is receiving treatment, such harsh news. She is battling.

They think they are protecting her but terminally ill does not mean stupid.

You need to go out and do the things you need to do for school and work, and the things that are optional too. When I was sick, I didn't want someone practically living with me. So I would definitely request you check with Sarah if that is really in her best interest... and with one of her nurses that will give you an honest answer. \n\nSecondly, you don't like this guy, and he's definitely not great. But you start by not wanting to create drama...by creating drama. Only you can know whether you didn't tell anyone because you were afraid they'd talk you out of it, or because you really had Sarah's best interest at heart. \n\nAlso, in not discussing this with her family, or other friends, you dumped a bomb onto an already exhausted system. Maybe Sarah did need to know, but is Sarah's mom in a place to support Sarah through this? You downplay her parents involvement, but my guess is they are very involved with their daughter. It's been a three year fight, and you didn't just make a decision for Sarah, you made a decision for the whole team that right now needed to be about this. \n\nLastly, you give me the vibes of \"only I love Sarah and understand her\" and that you feed off of the emotions of all of her experiences. I'm not saying best friends aren't special, but the way you talk about her makes it sound like she's the only one in the world to you and that you should be the only one in the world to her. \n\nOn mobile, sorry for formatting.", "NTA", "That\u2019s dangerous ground for someone who might not make it but it\u2019s a fact intensive decision.

Yes, it is horrible she has to battle cancer, but no disease takes your agency and dignity away. People do by assuming you can't handle things instead of being truthful and letting you decide. It's sad everyone else would rather lie to her face than leave the decision of what to do about her relationship to her.", "You are definitely NTA. She needed to know. I am willing to bet she knew something was up. He has not been coming to hospital like he was. She has cancer. She is not stupid. Besides, why would no one believe you? You had texts from him, right?
