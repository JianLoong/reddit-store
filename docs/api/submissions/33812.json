He is still close with his ex-wife and they share a teenager. She is constantly around and I have said that I wish we could have better boundaries. She will just show up whenever she wants and they talk about stuff regarding us and he still feels the need to take care of her when she is not feeling well. I get wanting to co-parent, but I do not like them talking about us or her just showing up unannounced whenever she wants. He just says that is how she is and I need to deal. My issue is not her coming over but doing it unannounced. We have 2 young children but they try to make all of the decisions for all of the kids. I\u2019ve been asking to move closer to family for a while because it is hard to raise two young g kids with no help, not even daycare. Anyway, her mom was very sick and she had to go out of town to take care of her. She decided to get rid of her apartment (which has always been within 15 min of us) and leave her cat with us. Now she is coming back and I was told that she was going to stay with a friend when she returns and was told this since before she left. Now that she is coming back in less than a week, I finally find out she is staying with us indefinitely and has not talked to her friend. I only found this out because I pushed to get an answer, I felt like I was being lied to by weird cryptic comments he would make to her on the phone.  We have 3 kids and a large dog in our rental house. Things are already crowded and stressful and I just wanted to know what was going on. Well my partner is treating me like a jerk because I am upset that we didn\u2019t have a conversation about this. Apparently, she just decided she is staying with us and didn\u2019t ask him either but told him. I find this hard to believe and is part of what makes me so angry about the situation. I don\u2019t mind helping out but internally I like to have a plan. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and \u201cmaybe\u201d for big life events are upsetting to me.
