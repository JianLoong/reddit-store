During Christmas, our friend group decided to plan a group vacation to the Bahamas.\n\nMy bf and I decided to extend our benefits and cover the flights. The thing is, our flights are fully free whereas friend/family tickets are not. Someone has to pay taxes on the friend/family tickets. Obviously, we\u2019re not going to pay those taxes.\n\nOver breakfast the next day, we told our friends we\u2019d extend our benefits and added in that they just need to send us money for the taxes. Everyone is super happy and agrees.\n\nFast-forward, it\u2019s time to book soon. I text everyone asking them to send me $90 each for the taxes.\n\nBoyfriend\u2019s best friend and girlfriend don\u2019t send us money. We think nothing of it. \n\nWe go out to dinner with them and remind them to each send us $90. The girlfriend gets prickly and says the taxes shouldn\u2019t be that high. She starts looking up round trips to see what the taxes cost. The numbers are all around $90, some more, some less. She then tells her boyfriend to send us $180 for the 2 of them.\n\nThe next day, all our friends FT my boyfriend and I to let us know that over the week, she was trying to tell everyone to ask for the receipts before sending money. She said, \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t be making money from us.\u201d All our friends defended us to her and told us we should revoke our offer.\n\nWe agreed. We called my boyfriend\u2019s best friend and told him we had to talk to him and his girlfriend. When she said, \u201chi, you\u2019re on speaker,\u201d we told them, \u201cwe\u2019re no longer extending our benefits to you 2. If you still want to come, you\u2019ll have to book your own flights. We don\u2019t appreciate you behaving like we\u2019re trying to make a quick buck from our friends.\u201d\n\nThey were both quiet. We just hung up after about a minute of silence.\n\nAm I the asshole?

Didn't know we were on r/ChoosingBeggars. You did a huge favour to them and they still managed to be entitled. What type of person accuses someone who is paying for their flights of \"wanting to make a quick buck\". Excuse me? Did they think how idiotic that sounds before saying it. And no you are 100% justified in making them pay for their own flights.", "NTA\n\n$90 to go to the Bahama's is an amazing deal. You are doing everybody a favor and arranged a great trip.\n\nIf those two don't appreciate your kindness and try to paint you as shifty to your other friends they don't deserve any special treatment.", "NTA. The girlfriend was acting entitled and unappreciative.", "NTA. If not for your offer, they would have been paying the full price anyway. She should have just been thankful that she had to pay way less. Never look a gift horse in the mouth", "NTA && can I come on the next $90 trip to the Bahamas!?!? What a steal!", "NTA. Serves them right.", "NTA.  That is such a red flag honestly. Horrible friends to do that in the first place. \n\nYou were clear and upfront from the beginning.  You didn\u2019t have to extend the benefit to them, but you did. If they are going to play this game, not your problem.", "NTA. I think you have discovered that some people are not truly friends.", "NTA I can't believe after you were so generous, they had the audacity to complain about paying only $90 in fees. And then after making it clear they had no intentions of paying, they decide to try and call you out by looking up the taxes, but even after proving that they weren't being ripped off....They don't apologize to you, but instead trash you to all your mutual friends an imply you're ripping everyone off?\n\nDon't just refuse to extend your benefits to them, DO NOT invite them on this trip. They're going to ruin the entire vacation, I'm certain of it. If your boyfriend's best friend is going to let his girlfriend steamroll him and treat you both so horribly, and refuses to defend you, it's time to reconsider this friendship.", "NTA. You had given them a pretty great deal, and they weren't happy with that, so you took that privilege away from them. All fair in my eyes", "Even if my friend did end up making a small amount of money off of me for it, I'd be appreciative because that's still significantly cheaper than buying your own ticket. And I imagine getting free tickets for others is not something that you guys can do ALL the time for work, so I wouldn't have even expected or asked for a free ticket and would be nothing but appreciative.\n\nI think revoking their tickets was the best move. NTA", "NTA. \n\nYou and your boyfriend were very generous in offering to cover the flight costs for your friends, and it was not fair for them to accuse you of trying to make a \"quick buck\" off of them. It is understandable that you would be angry and offended by their accusation, and you were justified in revoking your offer.", "NTA - there is no reason for you to cover the minimal taxes required by the government.", "NTA. You have them a great discount and they accused you of trying to profit off them. Great call on withdrawing the largely funded flights!", "You tried to do a nice thing, and they were being greedy and bad-mouthing you. You are NTA, but your \"friends\" sure are. It serves them right to pay full price for their tickets.", "NTA", "NTA. You were just making sure that nobody was taking advantage of anybody since they were so concerned about it.", "NTA.  They are rude and bad at googling.  Also they are pretty privileged; $90 is low for air taxes these days.  I have had to pay $81 to fly from Birmingham to Belfast, a flight of just 45 minutes.", "NTA - in the scheme of things $90 per person is peanuts and she\u2019s was entitled. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe them anything - have fun in the Bahamas!!!", "NTA - you offer free flights and they have to cover only taxes and the gf starts questioning if you\u2019re making money of it? I mean seriously WTF, it\u2019s such a nice gesture and they behave like morons. Good on you guys to cut them off", "NTA. They are being AHs. Of course they must pay, and it would have behooved them to do it quickly without any kind of questions.", "NTA", "NTA.  \n\nThe gf was within her right to verify that was correct, but her initial approach to that already sucked.  Then she goes and poisons the whole group unnecessarily even after she knew the $90 was correct.  \n\n\u201cThis is why we can\u2019t have nice things.\u201d\n\nShe sent a clear message that she doesn\u2019t trust you. \nHave fun on your trip without that toxic AH.  She\u2019d be nickle and diming every single thing on that trip.  Make sure to always get separate checks when she\u2019s involved since now you know she doesn\u2019t trust you.", "NTA, why should they be upset? You're no longer \"making money of of them\".  You musn't have been very good friends to them because they saw you being kind and doing them a favour as a malicious act on your part, you are not obligated to be nice to people who see the action as an offence.", "NTA. \n\nWell done.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Honestly it sounds okay to me if you want to end the friendship, but ultimately you'll need to make that call. So I'll say NTA but if you are seeking validation that you have it well, I don't agree. You took a punitive action to set your boundary when you could have started by talking to them about the impact their decision is having on you, only telling them after you hit them with the bombshell.", "ESH- I don't get why you're punishing your friend for his girlfriend's behaviour?

The math wasn't dumb, it was the premise that they were lying about what the taxes were that was off.", "I disagree. All OP did was set a reasonable boundary. Remember; OP proved to her that the taxes they were charging them were correct. Her initial hesitation at a high number is understandable, and OP responded gently the first time. When her actions became unreasonable, OP enforced boundaries. The woman is an adult, and knows appropriate behavior and consequences, yet she chose to bad mouth a friend that was doing her a big favor. OP has exactly zero moral responsibility over the death of a friendship that ended because someone else decided they couldn't act right", "Couldnt hardly disagree more. \n\nMischaracterizing an act of significant generosity as a way to screw their friends out of money and then broadcasting that as a fact, is an act of hostility.\n\nAre you suggesting that the OP should reinstate the offer after the girlfriend in question was badmouthing OP? In what world is that a reasonable response?\n\nIt is the friend and his girlfriend that poisoned the well. It is 100% down to them and I imagine they both know it.\n\nThis is doormat 101. If OP lets them get away with this nonsense, whats next?"]}
