She starts looking up round trips to see what the taxes cost. The numbers are all around $90, some more, some less. She then tells her boyfriend to send us $180 for the 2 of them.\n\nThe next day, all our friends FT my boyfriend and I to let us know that over the week, she was trying to tell everyone to ask for the receipts before sending money. She said, \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t be making money from us.\u201d All our friends defended us to her and told us we should revoke our offer.\n\nWe agreed. We called my boyfriend\u2019s best friend and told him we had to talk to him and his girlfriend.

Your family/spouse get better benefits, with higher priority and less cost.\n\nBuddy passes also tend to be a combination of base fee/taxes, so a US to Bahamas would likely be a lot more than just $90-ALL standby of course. \n\nOnce the ticket is issued, the actual amount they pay will be printed on their e-ticket/confirmation- so there is that receipt they ask for.  In some airlines you can use the passengers ccard, in others it requires the employee to use their own card and ask for reimbursement.\n\nIn the industry, it is known that giving these 'buddy' passes was the quickest way to lose friends, 'enemy passes' are the nickname now.

Now they get what they get", "YTA but not for the reason you think. I think you're describing airline flight benefits but you are insanely optimistic in your idea of how they work.

Thankfully, the rest of the group recognized the festering sore among them and nipped it before it spread.\n\nIf **anyone** calls me a liar and a thief, I would cut these people out of my life and they would not be travelling with me.

I won't be shocked if they say they can't afford it now.", "NTA. For those who don\u2019t know I\u2019ll add some context. If this is in the USA our taxes and fees for various kinds of free flights are relatively cheap. For award tickets they can be as low as $5.60 for one way domestic travel. Other types of free tickets like companion tickets can be as high as $99 with most airlines capping those taxes and fees around then. \n\nInternational travel is a different animal and those taxes and fees can be $25 or they can be a few hundred dollars. With international airlines it can be even more. \n\nWith that in mind $90 for a flight like this is reasonable for just taxes and fees. Very much so.

Airfare was included. The travel agent that the group used was very strange and issued a group ticket for each departure airport. (This prevented us from checking in online in advance). When we finally got our seat assignments, we had each been assigned to middle seats on one of the  flight segments. \n\nI texted  my friend that I was going to look  to see if there were any aisle seats (to which I could upgrade for a fee) and asked if she wanted me to upgrade her seat while I was in the system. I also gave her a estimated range  of the cost based on my past experience with seat upgrades. \n\nHer response was \"Thank You! Just let me know how much I owe you and I will get a check in the mail\".\n\nSince the cost was right in the middle of the range I had mentioned, I went ahead and booked them on the spot. (Had it been more expensive, I would have touched base with her first before purchasing).  \n\nPre-Covid,  I would often get groups together for programs at the Performing Arts Center. There was usually a range of prices for tickets which is what  would get printed on the ticket itself. But on top of that that would be charges for taxes, a facility fee, and the fee charged for booking on line. I made sure everyone knew about the extra charges and after purchasing the tickets I'd tell them what they owed me. No one ever asked to see the receipt to see if I was \"making a profit\".", "Right.
