He will never try again his food before adding additional seasoning which is a pet peeve of mine but I could get over it *if he ate it* but it ends up directly in the trash. He\u2019ll add a bunch of salt to an already salted dish, take one bite and then say \u201cew, it\u2019s too salty\u201d. Or dump a ton of red pepper on and then complain that it\u2019s too spicy. And etc. it\u2019s like he deliberately ruins his plate so he can complain about it. It\u2019s probably petty but it really got under my skin. And it bugs my boyfriend too to toss food that would\u2019ve been perfectly good without his tampering. \n\nI put up with this for 5 dinners and the. stopped inviting them. I\u2019ve still texted and met with Layla for coffee but I haven\u2019t extended another dinner invite. \n\nThey showed up this Monday without an invite right as we were starting dinner.

Voices got raised and eventually Layla and Lucas left but the mood was ruined for the night.\n\nEveryone who was present agreed with me but I guess Layla either told our old friend group or posted about it because I\u2019ve gotten an odd amount of texts from people I haven\u2019t talked to in years calling me an asshole for kicking them out over \u201cmy shitty cooking\u201d (it\u2019s not shitty!) so maybe I am.\n\n\n\n\nA small update - I received a very enlightening text from an old friend that Layla has kept close with. Apparently Lucas did not want to move at all but Layla was offered an amazing opportunity here so he agreed. According to this friend, Lucas has also sabotaged happy hour with her new coworkers and always \u201ccoincidentally\u201d needs her at home whenever she wants to go out with new friends. It seems like he is maybe trying to make her unhappy socially here so she\u2019ll be willing to move back home. I feel a little guilty for not picking up on this sooner but I\u2019m grateful for the perspective. I plan to reach out to Layla tomorrow and see if we can have a real talk about her situation.", "created_utc": 1674670119, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l57j8/aita_for_refusing_a_person_a_plate_after_they/", "score": 4006, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They didn\u2019t appreciate your efforts and they threw perfectly good food in the trash. That is a waste and disrespectful.", "INFO: Have you brought it up in private with either him or Layla that his behavior is unacceptable? I can understand not saying anything in front of everyone, you were trying to be a gracious host, but it sounds like a text to either person may have stopped either his behavior or them coming over uninvited.", "NTA\n\nIf Lucas doesn't like the food, then he can eat somewhere else. To complain about it openly while everyone is eating is so rude. Sounds like Lucas thinks the world revolves around him.", "NTA - you actively tried to deescalate by doing coffee with layla, and they  committed a major faux pas showing up uninvited", "ESH. I get where you\u2019re coming from, but you could have handled this a bit more tactfully. Did you have a conversation with Layla about it before cutting them off?

Did you just have the door open?\n\nSomething doesn't seem right about this post.", "ESH. They're both certainly TA for showing up uninvited and feeling entitled to dinner, but this sounds like it's rooted in a misunderstanding. If this was a recurring thing with most of the same invitees, Layla may have thought it was a standing invite and not realized it was intentional that you stopped inviting them, especially when norms around food waste differ between households (admittedly, him ever criticizing the food is downright rude).\n\nWhen guests showed up at your door with a room full of friends, you and your partner picked a fight when you could have more tactfully discussed this with Layla after the dinner party. I think they're the *bigger* asshole, but it sounds like you and your boyfriend made a deliberate decision to escalate the situation.", "INFO - why did you let them in? It seems a bit odd to let them come in and then refuse to let Lucas eat.

Then Lucas got mad at your boyfriend when he was stopped because he was not welcome to it. \n\n3) Lucas has behaved very rudely the first,and only, five times he\u2019s been PROPERLY invited to your dinner parties and has not been invited back since because of his inappropriate behavior and wasteful conduct.  \n\nTherefore, you will not tolerate anyone\u2019s disrespect and offensive comments, especially when they do not have all the facts to properly understand the situation to support a side.

Never mind showing up uninvited to then just help yourself to food that wasn't offered, after spending five dinners wasting it. Lucas can spend money on fast food, ruin it, and throw it out on his own dime.", "NTA, but also ESH. Lucas sucks the most, but you should have told him/them directly and privately instead of making everyone within earshot uncomfortable. Best to just say it's too stressful to appease his preferences and you'd prefer he not attend your gatherings anymore. That being said, after the second dinner I'd have scolded him like the child he is, so kudos for holding back for so long.", "NTA. Fuck both these entitled assholes. You put up with this 5 times? The second time would've been a deal-breaker and the law would have been laid down. I abhor deliberate food waste and find it morally obscene. To keep doing it is a deliberate insult of the host (my guess is Lucas doesn't want to be there and this has been an elaborate ploy to break up your friendship with Layla).\n\nGiven she's taken to shit talking you behind your back to old friends, it's time to remove both these AHs from your life. Feel free to tell your old friends what's really happened.", "NTA.  The old friend group is only saying you are because they were lied to.", "No definitely NTA. That would piss me off too, and I probably would have eventually called him out on it in front of everyone but that's just me.

What happened next wouldn't have if they were not there.", "NTA, send them a venmo for the cost of the wasted food", "I don\u2019t think I was direct enough, now that I really think about it. I tried taking the approach of asking Layla what he liked, if there was a different way I could prepare things because I hated seeing someone leave hungry. I thought she understood what I was getting at but in hindsight, I don\u2019t think she did. She said the food was great and he was just \u201cpicky\u201d but she\u2019d talk to him about taking less before trying it but nothing came from that.", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s true she could\u2019ve told her friend but who shows up to someone\u2019s house for dinner uninvited?! The rudeness is shocking", "THIS!", "Our hands were full so we asked a friend to get the door and she didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t think it would be them", "That was my thought as well. I wonder how the friend or her bf spun it to where they were totally mistreated and OP kicked them out unprovoked?", "I'm voting NTA then. It sounds like you were trying to politely tell them that his \"pickiness\" is unappreciated without bluntly saying it. You did everything you could politely do to stop the situation from happening but it sounds like Layla and boyfriend (possibly mostly bf) escalated the situation. Who goes over to someone's house uninvited?", "Adding seasoning to food without tasting it is not a big deal. Complaining that it's over seasoned, rude. Wasting it, also rude. \n\nI'm not convinced they knew they were showing up unannounced. OP has admitted to being unclear with Layla about her boyfriend, so I don't think inviting someone five times in a row then not inviting them directly necessarily means they understand they are *dis*invited from this weekly event.", "Not justifying the friend, but after 5 dinners it was probably assumed. That said, some people are just that blissfully aloof, or willfully ignorant.", "How did it get to the point where they accessed the plates and food?  Why didn't you ask them to leave? (or did you?)  Why do they think they could eat?  Why does it seem the point of the issue is that he seasons/wastes food and not  the food wasn't for him in the first place?", "I understand assuming, but most people would send a \u201ccan\u2019t wait to see you\u201d text", "People in this thread seem to think that friends always formally invite people to a weekly event and that it would unreasonable to show up to a weekly event you've always been invited to in the past without a formal invitation. I don't understand how people aren't seeing Layla's misunderstanding.", "My boyfriend and I had talked about not wanting them to attend anymore but we hadn\u2019t thought about them thinking it was a standing invitation so we weren\u2019t on the same page in the moment.\n\nOur friend let them in and when I saw them, I just wasn\u2019t going to say anything and then speak to Layla after. Meanwhile, my boyfriend was silently waiting for me to address it in the moment and when I didn\u2019t, he thought that meant I was waiting for him to handle it.", "One would think. This is why I always encourage over-communicating.", "You both need to address this with Layla asap. Also call her out on telling your old friend group cause she obviously didn\u2019t tell them the full story.", "INFO\n\nDid you tell them they were no longer invited? Are people personally invited every week? Or is it a standing invitation? Who let them in the house? You didn\u2019t realize they were there until they sat down to eat?", "If you haven\u2019t talked to the people angrily messaging you in years, and your dinner party regulars are on side, then you don\u2019t need to give a damn.", "Info: how did Lucas get into your place and all the way to the dinner table before you said something? If someone showed up to my door uninvited, I wouldn't let them in.", "NTA, they invited themselves, it's funny how they weren't kicked out right at the door. But yeah, making themsey comfortable and reaching for food when you are not welcome is a totally dick move on their part.", "NTA. Can't say I'd want him in my home either.", "NTA.  They showed up uninvited & then just started putting food on a plate? WTF? I'd cut them out.  Not worth it.", "INFO: did you directly tell them they were uninvited before the party?", "NTA\n\n\nHowever I feel like this couldve been brought up and handled in a multitude of other, less dramatic ways. Have you or your boyfriend brought this up with either Layla or Lucas? Why didnt you, after the 3d time he did that asked him directly if there is a reason he is purposfully making his plate inedible so he can complain? Why didnt you bring it up with Layla on one of your coffee outings? How did they even know when to show up uninvited, did some of the other invitees let it spill or?? Did you ask them why they came unannounced? \n\nTo be clear I dont think youre the asshole, but this was imo the least adult way to handle this. Good luck", "NTA\n\nAnd WTF? They're even spreading false rumors about you over it?\nI'd go scorched earth on those fuckers. Take this explanation and send it to everyone who asks you what happened. And if they show up again call the cops.\n\nHe, \"shouldn\u2019t be forced to eat things he doesn\u2019t like\". True. No one is forcing him to eat anything at all.", "INFO: How did Lucas manage to enter your home and walk into your dining room without correction before he began serving himself? Was this the first dinner since the five (I assume in a row?) they showed up to since you decided to stop inviting them? \n\nLucas is obviously TA, but if they previously had a standing invitation and didn't hear communication otherwise, I can see where the confusion would have come from. If someone showed up uninvited to a dinner party at my house, there's no way I wouldn't stop them at the door, though, so I am confused.", "ESH. From the sounds of it, they showed up because they assumed they were invited. That's on you, people often don't send out repetitive invitations for a regular event. You ought to have told Layla that they were no longer invited and why.\n\nLucas's behavior is abhorrent, he is obviously the main AH of this story and you are not obligated to feed him, but I think you handled it poorly.", "[removed]", "Nta\n\nEveryone there that knows the truth is on your side.

She even showed up uninvited for shitty cooking, man, she must be starving! /s\n\nBut Layla saw what her fiance did all the time and never said anything. I would be so embarassed, but no, she even made this post because you don't want to deal with his disrespectful and wastful behaviour. She seems to enable his behaviour all the time. Maybe it was also on purpose, if she now claims that you cook awful. She maybe told her fiance to behave like your food is shit. Were you really friends?", "NTA.

What a generous thing you're doing though hosting these great dinners.", "Respond that you didn't kick them out over your cooking. You didn't invite them in the first place because he ruins the food so he can complain, and then waste it, and you don't have the money, time, or emotional bandwidth to watch this man continue to disrespect you in your own home.

Obviously, you can set out S&P for people to use individually on their portions. But if I am understanding you right, he's ruining the ENTIRE dish by adding spices to it that then keep you from being able to eat it any further. He sounds like a miserable person and I wouldn't invite him either. I would just write back to the texts \"I'm sorry you feel that way, but because Lucas insists on ruining food for everyone by pouring various spices into the pots on the stove, he's not invited anymore. If he wants to ruin his own portion of food by oversalting it, he'd be welcome to do that, but he is not welcome to alter the food I've/so&so made to my liking.\"", "ESH.

There\u2019s a big difference between paying for your own food and someone else cooking and serving you food *in their own home*. \n\nWhen someone purchases, preps, cooks, and serves you food, it is definitely rude to not even *taste* it before throwing seasoning or sauce all over it. If you try it and prefer it saltier, add salt. Want heat? Add hot sauce. \n\nBut for people to act like there are no standards of conduct for eating food at someone else\u2019s house is ridiculous.

They tried to crash your party and you didn't let them. Good for you. Toss them in the trash like they do your food.

Has there been some confusion? \n- took your friend aside and explained the situation", "NTA. You had an uninvited guest show up who has never once been respectful of your cooking endeavors previously. \n\nFor both to show up uninvited (assuming both), was pretty bold. \n\nI'm going on a limb and assuming you didn't realize it was them when they knocked or rang a door bell, and probably invited them in. It's something I would do as I'm overly polite and not confrontational, even I wasn't expecting them. For Lucas to then proceed in and start eating was over the top. \n\nYour friend is also the asshole for going around and spreading potential disinformation to as many people as possible without self reflecting on what caused the situation. As someone else said, co grays you've availed yourself of a pretty terrible friend who finally showed true colors!", "I think people upset that someone salts, peppers or hot sauces foods really need to chillout. I get why the person who cooked might feel some type of way, but ultimately you really need to get over it. Some people like different things....but I draw the line at insulting. It's ok to ask for ketchup (or whatever) but to then insult is not cool. This guy is taking it even further with throwing it out after a bite or 2. That is absolutely out of bounds.

On a base level, its one thing if someone adds additional seasonings to their taste and actually eats it. You can't realistically expect everyone's palate to be the same as yours. You are right though is drawing the line at Lucas' BS. Ruining and then complaining about 5 dinners? You let that go maybe 3 dinners to long. I'm surprised you even let them in showing up unannounced. If this ever happens again, a perfectly valid response is \"We are about to eat dinner. Call me later and we can make plans.\" and shut the door on their faces.", "So adding more seasoning and complaining is not good.
