Then called your cooking shitty.  I think any dinner would be better without people like this.", "NTA\n\nLayla and Lucas are probably telling your old friends a significantly different version of the story.", "NTA\n\nAside from his odd behaviour surrounding dinner, he was an uninvited guest, it was a bit cheeky of them to pop around without checking first.\n\nAlso, who texts old friends about an incident they weren't involved in to berate them? Who are these weirdos?", "The part where he adds salt and then is grossed out because it's, \"too salty.\" Made me laugh. (As a host, I get it, that would drive me crazy) But it just reminds me of my toddlers and how picky they are.\n\nConsidering what he has done in the past and how he invited himself over...I'd say NTA.", "NTA. You don\u2019t show up uninvited to someone\u2019s house for dinner and then complain about the food. And even if you are invited you still don\u2019t show up to their house for dinner and complain about the food. They didn\u2019t appreciate your efforts and they threw perfectly good food in the trash. That is a waste and disrespectful.", "INFO: Have you brought it up in private with either him or Layla that his behavior is unacceptable? I can understand not saying anything in front of everyone, you were trying to be a gracious host, but it sounds like a text to either person may have stopped either his behavior or them coming over uninvited.", "NTA\n\nIf Lucas doesn't like the food, then he can eat somewhere else. To complain about it openly while everyone is eating is so rude. Sounds like Lucas thinks the world revolves around him.", "NTA - you actively tried to deescalate by doing coffee with layla, and they  committed a major faux pas showing up uninvited", "ESH. I get where you\u2019re coming from, but you could have handled this a bit more tactfully. Did you have a conversation with Layla about it before cutting them off? You could have kindly expressed your feelings when they were there, or tactfully commented about his wasting food, but causing a scene just made it worse.", "Who just invited themselves over to someone's to eat, complains about the food then kicks off when they're asked to leave. \n\nNTA the fact they've brought other people into proves they're childish and the facts other people are texting you saying your an A says to me they've lied about the situation too. \n\nI think it would be best to cut ties with these 'friends'", "Info:  Assuming you weren't eating outside, how did they get in? Did you just have the door open?\n\nSomething doesn't seem right about this post.", "ESH. They're both certainly TA for showing up uninvited and feeling entitled to dinner, but this sounds like it's rooted in a misunderstanding. If this was a recurring thing with most of the same invitees, Layla may have thought it was a standing invite and not realized it was intentional that you stopped inviting them, especially when norms around food waste differ between households (admittedly, him ever criticizing the food is downright rude).\n\nWhen guests showed up at your door with a room full of friends, you and your partner picked a fight when you could have more tactfully discussed this with Layla after the dinner party. I think they're the *bigger* asshole, but it sounds like you and your boyfriend made a deliberate decision to escalate the situation.", "INFO - why did you let them in? It seems a bit odd to let them come in and then refuse to let Lucas eat. You could have spared yourself this drama by telling them as soon as they walked in that they weren\u2019t invited and you don\u2019t have enough food for them.", "NTA\n\nWhile you don\u2019t owe it to them, I think it might have gone over better to have talked to Layla while you were having coffee, to let her know that his behavior is insulting and wasteful, and that you wouldn\u2019t be inviting him to any more dinners if he continued.\n\nUnless you explicitly told them, you can\u2019t assume they knew it was bothering you (as reasonable and understandable as your position is).\n\nI\u2019m sorry to hear that this happened but I hope you have lovey dinner nights moving forward.

Make sure you respond to everyone telling them that:\n\n1) Lucas and Layla showed up unannounced and uninvited to your home for your dinner party. \n\n2) Lucas helped himself to your dinner without asking or being invited to it. Then Lucas got mad at your boyfriend when he was stopped because he was not welcome to it. \n\n3) Lucas has behaved very rudely the first and only five times he\u2019s been properly invited to your dinner parties and has not been invited back since because of his inappropriate behavior and wasteful conduct. \n\nTherefore, you will not tolerate anyone\u2019s disrespect and offensive comments, especially when they do not have all the facts to properly understand the situation to support a side. You will not be discussing it any further with any else other than Layla and Lucas, the only other two involved, as it\u2019s no one else\u2019s business.", "NTA\n\nAnd who cares if people who are not in your life anymore take their side?

It's all there.", "[deleted]", "NTA, nothing pisses me off more than wasting food. Never mind showing up uninvited to then just help yourself to food that wasn't offered, after spending five dinners wasting it. Lucas can spend money on fast food, ruin it, and throw it out on his own dime.", "NTA, but also ESH. Lucas sucks the most, but you should have told him/them directly and privately instead of making everyone within earshot uncomfortable. Best to just say it's too stressful to appease his preferences and you'd prefer he not attend your gatherings anymore. That being said, after the second dinner I'd have scolded him like the child he is, so kudos for holding back for so long.", "NTA. Fuck both these entitled assholes. You put up with this 5 times? The second time would've been a deal-breaker and the law would have been laid down. I abhor deliberate food waste and find it morally obscene. To keep doing it is a deliberate insult of the host (my guess is Lucas doesn't want to be there and this has been an elaborate ploy to break up your friendship with Layla).\n\nGiven she's taken to shit talking you behind your back to old friends, it's time to remove both these AHs from your life. Feel free to tell your old friends what's really happened.", "NTA.  The old friend group is only saying you are because they were lied to.", "No definitely NTA. That would piss me off too, and I probably would have eventually called him out on it in front of everyone but that's just me. If Lucas doesn't like the food, he certainly don't need show up, take a full plate of it, and then dump it in the trash. He definitely sounds like he's just being an AH and wasting his own and your time.", "NTA. if he was this picky (which i doubt, it\u2019s just him trying to be the center of attention) then he could just come to visit, eat before, and tell everyone he just was super picky but still wanted to enjoy everyone\u2019s company. but he just wants to make a scene. also i totally get why it bugs you that he adds stuff to your dishes. my dad ALWAYS does the same. he adds pepper and parmesan cheese to every single dish. and i tell him it already has a good flavor just to try it first. it\u2019s so frustrating", "NTA - I guarantee Layla spun the story to her friends so she's the hero. Bet she didn't tell them she wasn't invited and just showed up.", "NTA  \n\n\nAll else aside, they were not invited.", "NTA - they turned up uninvited. That was rude and improper. What happened next wouldn't have if they were not there.", "NTA, send them a venmo for the cost of the wasted food", "I don\u2019t think I was direct enough, now that I really think about it. I tried taking the approach of asking Layla what he liked, if there was a different way I could prepare things because I hated seeing someone leave hungry. I thought she understood what I was getting at but in hindsight, I don\u2019t think she did. She said the food was great and he was just \u201cpicky\u201d but she\u2019d talk to him about taking less before trying it but nothing came from that.", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s true she could\u2019ve told her friend but who shows up to someone\u2019s house for dinner uninvited?! The rudeness is shocking", "THIS!", "Our hands were full so we asked a friend to get the door and she didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t think it would be them", "That was my thought as well. I wonder how the friend or her bf spun it to where they were totally mistreated and OP kicked them out unprovoked?", "I'm voting NTA then. It sounds like you were trying to politely tell them that his \"pickiness\" is unappreciated without bluntly saying it. You did everything you could politely do to stop the situation from happening but it sounds like Layla and boyfriend (possibly mostly bf) escalated the situation. Who goes over to someone's house uninvited?", "Adding seasoning to food without tasting it is not a big deal. Complaining that it's over seasoned, rude. Wasting it, also rude. \n\nI'm not convinced they knew they were showing up unannounced. OP has admitted to being unclear with Layla about her boyfriend, so I don't think inviting someone five times in a row then not inviting them directly necessarily means they understand they are *dis*invited from this weekly event.", "Not justifying the friend, but after 5 dinners it was probably assumed. That said, some people are just that blissfully aloof, or willfully ignorant.", "How did it get to the point where they accessed the plates and food?  Why didn't you ask them to leave? (or did you?)  Why do they think they could eat?  Why does it seem the point of the issue is that he seasons/wastes food and not  the food wasn't for him in the first place?", "I understand assuming, but most people would send a \u201ccan\u2019t wait to see you\u201d text", "People in this thread seem to think that friends always formally invite people to a weekly event and that it would unreasonable to show up to a weekly event you've always been invited to in the past without a formal invitation. I don't understand how people aren't seeing Layla's misunderstanding.", "My boyfriend and I had talked about not wanting them to attend anymore but we hadn\u2019t thought about them thinking it was a standing invitation so we weren\u2019t on the same page in the moment.\n\nOur friend let them in and when I saw them, I just wasn\u2019t going to say anything and then speak to Layla after. Meanwhile, my boyfriend was silently waiting for me to address it in the moment and when I didn\u2019t, he thought that meant I was waiting for him to handle it.", "One would think. This is why I always encourage over-communicating.", "You both need to address this with Layla asap. Also call her out on telling your old friend group cause she obviously didn\u2019t tell them the full story.", "INFO\n\nDid you tell them they were no longer invited? Are people personally invited every week? Or is it a standing invitation? Who let them in the house? You didn\u2019t realize they were there until they sat down to eat?", "If you haven\u2019t talked to the people angrily messaging you in years, and your dinner party regulars are on side, then you don\u2019t need to give a damn.", "Info: how did Lucas get into your place and all the way to the dinner table before you said something? If someone showed up to my door uninvited, I wouldn't let them in.", "NTA, they invited themselves, it's funny how they weren't kicked out right at the door. But yeah, making themsey comfortable and reaching for food when you are not welcome is a totally dick move on their part.", "NTA. Can't say I'd want him in my home either.", "NTA.  They showed up uninvited & then just started putting food on a plate? WTF? I'd cut them out.  Not worth it.", "INFO: did you directly tell them they were uninvited before the party?", "NTA\n\n\nHowever I feel like this couldve been brought up and handled in a multitude of other, less dramatic ways. Have you or your boyfriend brought this up with either Layla or Lucas? Why didnt you, after the 3d time he did that asked him directly if there is a reason he is purposfully making his plate inedible so he can complain? Why didnt you bring it up with Layla on one of your coffee outings? How did they even know when to show up uninvited, did some of the other invitees let it spill or?? Did you ask them why they came unannounced? \n\nTo be clear I dont think youre the asshole, but this was imo the least adult way to handle this. Good luck", "NTA\n\nAnd WTF? They're even spreading false rumors about you over it?\nI'd go scorched earth on those fuckers. Take this explanation and send it to everyone who asks you what happened. And if they show up again call the cops.\n\nHe, \"shouldn\u2019t be forced to eat things he doesn\u2019t like\". True. No one is forcing him to eat anything at all.", "INFO: How did Lucas manage to enter your home and walk into your dining room without correction before he began serving himself? Was this the first dinner since the five (I assume in a row?) they showed up to since you decided to stop inviting them? \n\nLucas is obviously TA, but if they previously had a standing invitation and didn't hear communication otherwise, I can see where the confusion would have come from. If someone showed up uninvited to a dinner party at my house, there's no way I wouldn't stop them at the door, though, so I am confused.", "ESH. From the sounds of it, they showed up because they assumed they were invited. That's on you, people often don't send out repetitive invitations for a regular event. You ought to have told Layla that they were no longer invited and why.\n\nLucas's behavior is abhorrent, he is obviously the main AH of this story and you are not obligated to feed him, but I think you handled it poorly.", "[removed]", "Nta\n\nEveryone there that knows the truth is on your side. The only people that back her are people that weren't there that she most likely lied to.", "NTA\n\nThey were party crashers, and party crashers don't get fed.", "NTA Why does Layla makes such a big fuss that she got kicked out when you cooking was shit anyway?! She even showed up uninvited for shitty cooking, man, she must be starving! /s\n\nBut Layla saw what her fiance did all the time and never said anything. I would be so embarassed, but no, she even made this post because you don't want to deal with his disrespectful and wastful behaviour. She seems to enable his behaviour all the time. Maybe it was also on purpose, if she now claims that you cook awful. She maybe told her fiance to behave like your food is shit. Were you really friends?", "NTA. They invited themselves, and he says that he doesn't like the food, so why would he even want to take a plate of it?", "NTA - they weren't invited and he's not respectful.", "NTA, he's wasting your food, F that!", "NTA how many times have you been invited to their place? They both sound like takers.", "NTA. I'd love to know if all the flying monkeys who were called in to text you actually know that these guys showed up uninvited?", "NTA. If I ever showed up to another person's house unexpectedly around dinner time ( which I have never done-rude), I would be bringing dinner, or at least something complimentary, myself. I definitely wouldn't expect anyone to feed me. Also who prepares their own plate in another person's home? Unless the host called for everyone to serve themselves from a central platter.  Everything this person has done is the height of rudeness even if he was a model guest all other times.", "NTA whatsoever. Good riddance to the rude, wasteful, unappreciative AH moochers who obviously lied to the old friend group. Good grief. What a generous thing you're doing though hosting these great dinners.", "Respond that you didn't kick them out over your cooking. You didn't invite them in the first place because he ruins the food so he can complain, and then waste it, and you don't have the money, time, or emotional bandwidth to watch this man continue to disrespect you in your own home.

Honestly, even though you probably should have been more direct to begin with, you DID NOT invite them so all blame is on them for showing up uninvited and helping themselves. If they want to air dirty laundry to others then put the whole story out on line and block anyone who continues to harass you, including them.\n\nI have called people out on wasting food that I paid for myself, and would never behave that way myself at anyone else's home. Beyond disrespectful.", "NTA at all. Not invited. For a reason. Unless they made the dish, they have NO RIGHT to salt it or add anything to it unless it's on their plate. Obviously, you can set out S&P for people to use individually on their portions. But if I am understanding you right, he's ruining the ENTIRE dish by adding spices to it that then keep you from being able to eat it any further. He sounds like a miserable person and I wouldn't invite him either. I would just write back to the texts \"I'm sorry you feel that way, but because Lucas insists on ruining food for everyone by pouring various spices into the pots on the stove, he's not invited anymore. If he wants to ruin his own portion of food by oversalting it, he'd be welcome to do that, but he is not welcome to alter the food I've/so&so made to my liking.\"", "ESH. Maybe since she\u2019s your friend, you could have talked to her about it instead of just uninviting her. She probably wondered why.", "> I\u2019ve gotten an odd amount of texts from people I haven\u2019t talked to in years calling me an asshole for kicking them out over \u201cmy shitty cooking\u201d \n\nPeople only getting one side of the story taking the side of the people telling it?  \n\n\nImagine that.

I\u2019ve seen a few posts like this recently and something\u2019s been bothering me. \n\nI understand some people say you should be able to do whatever you want with your food, but that only really applies at *restaurants*. There\u2019s a big difference between paying for your own food and someone else cooking and serving you food *in their own home*. \n\nWhen someone purchases, preps, cooks, and serves you food, it is definitely rude to not even *taste* it before throwing seasoning or sauce all over it. If you try it and prefer it saltier, add salt. Want heat? Add hot sauce. \n\nBut for people to act like there are no standards of conduct for eating food at someone else\u2019s house is ridiculous. Anyone that cooks for others regularly (or seriously) is very aware of this.", "NTA - why does anyone care if \"your food sucks\"?", "Keep hosting. Don\u2019t discuss them. Move forward. In a few weeks people will not even remember them.", "Take care of your friend.  She's in a shit relationship with a domineering   partner.  Give it time and hopefully she will realize and she will need her friends to support her.  You were perfectly within polite boundaries over and over and don't give a shit or engage about the social media on the event. 3 months from now he'll find some other friend of hers to degrade and distance her from.", "NTA. But I would put people straight over the facts that:\n1- They were not invited\n2- Were rude even after you accommodated them.\n3- Keep wasting food and being rude about it.\n\nPlus if the food is so bad why would they invite themselves?", "NTA. They tried to crash your party and you didn't let them. Good for you. Toss them in the trash like they do your food. Also, I'm sure she told her friends a different story than what really happened, so fill them in on the truth.", "OP why did you even let them enter when they were uninvited? You could of told them to come in later you\u2019re having dinner or seated them in a different room like just said that \n- hey I didn\u2019t know y\u2019all were coming you are welcome to come in but could you please wait in the other room we have a private dinner planned \n- I am sorry we are in the middle of dinner and we weren\u2019t expecting you! Has there been some confusion? \n- took your friend aside and explained the situation", "NTA. You had an uninvited guest show up who has never once been respectful of your cooking endeavors previously. \n\nFor both to show up uninvited (assuming both), was pretty bold. \n\nI'm going on a limb and assuming you didn't realize it was them when they knocked or rang a door bell, and probably invited them in. It's something I would do as I'm overly polite and not confrontational, even I wasn't expecting them. For Lucas to then proceed in and start eating was over the top. \n\nYour friend is also the asshole for going around and spreading potential disinformation to as many people as possible without self reflecting on what caused the situation. As someone else said, co grays you've availed yourself of a pretty terrible friend who finally showed true colors!", "I think people upset that someone salts, peppers or hot sauces foods really need to chillout. I get why the person who cooked might feel some type of way, but ultimately you really need to get over it. Some people like different things....but I draw the line at insulting. It's ok to ask for ketchup (or whatever) but to then insult is not cool. This guy is taking it even further with throwing it out after a bite or 2. That is absolutely out of bounds.

On a base level, its one thing if someone adds additional seasonings to their taste and actually eats it. You can't realistically expect everyone's palate to be the same as yours. You are right though is drawing the line at Lucas' BS. Ruining and then complaining about 5 dinners? You let that go maybe 3 dinners to long. I'm surprised you even let them in showing up unannounced. If this ever happens again, a perfectly valid response is \"We are about to eat dinner. Call me later and we can make plans.\" and shut the door on their faces.", "So adding more seasoning and complaining is not good.

Lucas is insufferable and any person who delivery wastes food for fun is an A.", "My dnd group still confirmed every engagement even if we knew it was a weekly thing. Because you don't show up uninvited at someone else's house. It's basic courtesy.", "><<*I put up with this for 5 dinners and the. stopped inviting them. I\u2019ve still texted and met with Layla for coffee but I haven\u2019t extended another dinner invite.*\\>>  \n>  \n>This makes it clear that she extends invitations(each time) and that she's had some times between last invite and the \"show up\" without invite(time to meet Layla for coffee).  Layla and her bf shouldn't have assumed--she should have asked at least before showing up.", "or vampires? <Wink>", ">I\u2019ve still texted and met with Layla for coffee but I haven\u2019t extended another dinner invite.\n\nThat's what OP said. That conveys to me they haven't been invited to several dinners & didn't come.  Now suddenly they came to this one.", "Why didn't Layla call or text to confirm then?  That would've made sense rather than assuming.", "I can imagine that scenario.  I used to have a friend group of recent college graduates.  We'd get together at one guy's house, who would cook dinner (and we'd all throw in $5 or so, and/or provide beer/wine).  This was every Wednesday, btw, for 20+ years.  It never occurred to me to expect an email invite.  Maybe I'm off base though...", "OP said she had stopped inviting them to Monday night dinners because of Layla\u2019s bf\u2019s behavior. And she also said that they did the Monday night dinners often, but not every week. I took that to mean that, after not being invited for several Monday night dinners, they just stopped by (probably on purpose just to see if they were purposely not invited). This could all have been avoided if OP had just talked to her friend on one of their coffee dates & let her know why she had stopped inviting them", "I don't see her misunderstanding. It's a home, not a restaurant. I don't even go to my parents' place without giving them a heads up. It's called common sense and good manners.", "Just reply to the texts \"mm.. yeah, so 'shitty' that they came uninvited to eat it.\" After the first three times I would have hidden the spices in the bedroom and said you \"ran out of everything finishing the meal, guess we'll just have to try it!\"", "Mutual friends maybe? We'll see you Monday at OP's house.", "In what seems to be a now-deleted comment, OP said the way she tried to bring this up with Layla was to ask what Layla's boyfriend wanted to eat since he didn't seem to like her food.\n\nThis to me suggests OP is not a direct communicator. It also implies OP was open to still inviting them, since she asked about his preferences at coffee.", ">They were deliberately not invited for weeks\n\nWe don't know that, OP didn't give a detailed timeline. We know the person has been in the area for 2 months and they were explicitly invited to 5 dinners. That could have been within 6 weeks, OP did not say.", "Sure, it would have, but why didn\u2019t OP tell them she didn\u2019t want them over instead of assuming they would figure it out?", "this might be a cultural thing. i moved to a rural southern area near my partner\u2019s family, and they have weekly dinners where formal invitations aren\u2019t really part of it. personally i would be pissed off anytime someone showed up to my house unannounced, but apparently not everyone\u2019s like that", "Doesn't matter how informal it felt, they had obviously received an invite from the host every time they'd come in the past\u2014so when they don't get an invite, it is rude of them to show up anyway.", "Yeah no matter how common it is there is always a chance you are doing something else this week. Or needs it later or whatever.  \n\n\nMaybe if it has been going on for literally years, but it is just so weird to just turn up!", "Maybe not a formal invite, but some communication about it beforehand. There's always a chance they're sick this week, or had to go to a funeral, or a family emergency or something. I would never just show up without at least a \"we still on tonight?\" message.", "I\u2019m not disagreeing.  Just pointing out what might have been their \u201clogic\u201d."]}
