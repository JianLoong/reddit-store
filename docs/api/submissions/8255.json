And I bet Layla told everyone a very different story.", "What a coincidence that there's immediately another thread about guests insulting and then asking to re-season the host's food.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10kgbuo/aita_for_not_letting_my_sisters_boyfriend_use_hot/", "NTA\n\nSounds like the situation has sorted itself out\n\n1) The friendship with these two people is over.  Congrats\n\n2) The friendships with the people who supported them are over as well.  Congrats on that too\n\n3) Block them all, lock down your social media...and enjoy your dinner parties from now on", "NTA. I wouldn't want him in my home either", "NTA...They showed up uninvited. Then called your cooking shitty.  I think any dinner would be better without people like this.", "NTA\n\nLayla and Lucas are probably telling your old friends a significantly different version of the story.", "NTA\n\nAside from his odd behaviour surrounding dinner, he was an uninvited guest, it was a bit cheeky of them to pop around without checking first.\n\nAlso, who texts old friends about an incident they weren't involved in to berate them? Who are these weirdos?", "The part where he adds salt and then is grossed out because it's, \"too salty.\" Made me laugh. (As a host, I get it, that would drive me crazy) But it just reminds me of my toddlers and how picky they are.\n\nConsidering what he has done in the past and how he invited himself over...I'd say NTA.", "NTA. You don\u2019t show up uninvited to someone\u2019s house for dinner and then complain about the food. And even if you are invited you still don\u2019t show up to their house for dinner and complain about the food. They didn\u2019t appreciate your efforts and they threw perfectly good food in the trash. That is a waste and disrespectful.", "INFO: Have you brought it up in private with either him or Layla that his behavior is unacceptable? I can understand not saying anything in front of everyone, you were trying to be a gracious host, but it sounds like a text to either person may have stopped either his behavior or them coming over uninvited.", "NTA\n\nIf Lucas doesn't like the food, then he can eat somewhere else. To complain about it openly while everyone is eating is so rude. Sounds like Lucas thinks the world revolves around him.", "NTA - you actively tried to deescalate by doing coffee with layla, and they  committed a major faux pas showing up uninvited", "ESH. I get where you\u2019re coming from, but you could have handled this a bit more tactfully. Did you have a conversation with Layla about it before cutting them off? You could have kindly expressed your feelings when they were there, or tactfully commented about his wasting food, but causing a scene just made it worse.", "Who just invited themselves over to someone's to eat, complains about the food then kicks off when they're asked to leave. \n\nNTA the fact they've brought other people into proves they're childish and the facts other people are texting you saying your an A says to me they've lied about the situation too. \n\nI think it would be best to cut ties with these 'friends'", "Info:  Assuming you weren't eating outside, how did they get in? Did you just have the door open?\n\nSomething doesn't seem right about this post.", "ESH. They're both certainly TA for showing up uninvited and feeling entitled to dinner, but this sounds like it's rooted in a misunderstanding. If this was a recurring thing with most of the same invitees, Layla may have thought it was a standing invite and not realized it was intentional that you stopped inviting them, especially when norms around food waste differ between households (admittedly, him ever criticizing the food is downright rude).\n\nWhen guests showed up at your door with a room full of friends, you and your partner picked a fight when you could have more tactfully discussed this with Layla after the dinner party. I think they're the *bigger* asshole, but it sounds like you and your boyfriend made a deliberate decision to escalate the situation.", "INFO - why did you let them in? It seems a bit odd to let them come in and then refuse to let Lucas eat. You could have spared yourself this drama by telling them as soon as they walked in that they weren\u2019t invited and you don\u2019t have enough food for them.", "NTA\n\nWhile you don\u2019t owe it to them, I think it might have gone over better to have talked to Layla while you were having coffee, to let her know that his behavior is insulting and wasteful, and that you wouldn\u2019t be inviting him to any more dinners if he continued.\n\nUnless you explicitly told them, you can\u2019t assume they knew it was bothering you (as reasonable and understandable as your position is).\n\nI\u2019m sorry to hear that this happened but I hope you have lovey dinner nights moving forward. How nice of you and your boyfriend to host this regularly. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc99", "NTA. Make sure you respond to everyone telling them that \n\n1) Lucas and Layla showed up unannounced and uninvited to your home for your dinner party. \n\n2) Lucas helped himself to your dinner without asking or being invited to it. Then Lucas got mad at your boyfriend when he was stopped because he was not welcome to it. \n\n3) Lucas has behaved very rudely the first and only five times he\u2019s been properly invited to your dinner parties and has not been invited back since because of his inappropriate behavior and wasteful conduct. \n\nTherefore, you will not tolerate anyone\u2019s disrespect and offensive comments, especially when they do not have all the facts to properly understand the situation to support a side. You will not be discussing it any further with any else other than Layla and Lucas, the only other two involved as it\u2019s no one else\u2019s business.", "NTA\n\nAnd who cares if people who are not in your life anymore take their side? Let Lucas and Layla go have dinner at their place in the future.", "NTA. They weren\u2019t invited. That\u2019s all anyone needs to know. You can\u2019t complain about an event that no one wanted you at.", "ESH You should have stopped them at the door instead of at the plate.  To let them enter the house and then refuse food doesn't make sense.  \n\nAnd I don't need to comment on your friend's bf.  It's all there.", "[deleted]", "NTA, nothing pisses me off more than wasting food. Never mind showing up uninvited to then just help yourself to food that wasn't offered, after spending five dinners wasting it. Lucas can spend money on fast food, ruin it, and throw it out on his own dime.", "NTA, but also ESH. Lucas sucks the most, but you should have told him/them directly and privately instead of making everyone within earshot uncomfortable. Best to just say it's too stressful to appease his preferences and you'd prefer he not attend your gatherings anymore. That being said, after the second dinner I'd have scolded him like the child he is, so kudos for holding back for so long.", "NTA. Fuck both these entitled assholes. You put up with this 5 times? The second time would've been a deal-breaker and the law would have been laid down. I abhor deliberate food waste and find it morally obscene. To keep doing it is a deliberate insult of the host (my guess is Lucas doesn't want to be there and this has been an elaborate ploy to break up your friendship with Layla).\n\nGiven she's taken to shit talking you behind your back to old friends, it's time to remove both these AHs from your life. Feel free to tell your old friends what's really happened.", "NTA.  The old friend group is only saying you are because they were lied to.", "No definitely NTA. That would piss me off too, and I probably would have eventually called him out on it in front of everyone but that's just me. If Lucas doesn't like the food, he certainly don't need show up, take a full plate of it, and then dump it in the trash. He definitely sounds like he's just being an AH and wasting his own and your time.", "NTA. if he was this picky (which i doubt, it\u2019s just him trying to be the center of attention) then he could just come to visit, eat before, and tell everyone he just was super picky but still wanted to enjoy everyone\u2019s company. but he just wants to make a scene. also i totally get why it bugs you that he adds stuff to your dishes. my dad ALWAYS does the same. he adds pepper and parmesan cheese to every single dish. and i tell him it already has a good flavor just to try it first. it\u2019s so frustrating", "NTA - I guarantee Layla spun the story to her friends so she's the hero. Bet she didn't tell them she wasn't invited and just showed up.", "NTA  \n\n\nAll else aside, they were not invited.", "NTA - they turned up uninvited. That was rude and improper. What happened next wouldn't have if they were not there.", "NTA, send them a venmo for the cost of the wasted food", "I don\u2019t think I was direct enough, now that I really think about it. I tried taking the approach of asking Layla what he liked, if there was a different way I could prepare things because I hated seeing someone leave hungry. I thought she understood what I was getting at but in hindsight, I don\u2019t think she did. She said the food was great and he was just \u201cpicky\u201d but she\u2019d talk to him about taking less before trying it but nothing came from that.", "Adding seasoning to food with out tasting it, then complaining that it\u2019s over seasoned and throwing it out - when it isn\u2019t your food is beyond the pale.\n\nShowing up unannounced to a dinner party you weren\u2019t invited to, when you know you will simply be throwing the food out is insane.\n\nBlasting the couple whose home you invaded to a wide group of people (with a clearly false narrative) is malicious.\n\nThis is an unbelievably bad take. NTA", "It\u2019s true she could\u2019ve told her friend but who shows up to someone\u2019s house for dinner uninvited?! The rudeness is shocking", "THIS!", "Our hands were full so we asked a friend to get the door and she didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t think it would be them", "That was my thought as well. I wonder how the friend or her bf spun it to where they were totally mistreated and OP kicked them out unprovoked?", "I'm voting NTA then. It sounds like you were trying to politely tell them that his \"pickiness\" is unappreciated without bluntly saying it. You did everything you could politely do to stop the situation from happening but it sounds like Layla and boyfriend (possibly mostly bf) escalated the situation. Who goes over to someone's house uninvited?", "Adding seasoning to food without tasting it is not a big deal. Complaining that it's over seasoned, rude. Wasting it, also rude. \n\nI'm not convinced they knew they were showing up unannounced. OP has admitted to being unclear with Layla about her boyfriend, so I don't think inviting someone five times in a row then not inviting them directly necessarily means they understand they are *dis*invited from this weekly event.", "Not justifying the friend, but after 5 dinners it was probably assumed. That said, some people are just that blissfully aloof, or willfully ignorant.", "How did it get to the point where they accessed the plates and food?  Why didn't you ask them to leave? (or did you?)  Why do they think they could eat?  Why does it seem the point of the issue is that he seasons/wastes food and not  the food wasn't for him in the first place?", "I understand assuming, but most people would send a \u201ccan\u2019t wait to see you\u201d text", "People in this thread seem to think that friends always formally invite people to a weekly event and that it would unreasonable to show up to a weekly event you've always been invited to in the past without a formal invitation. I don't understand how people aren't seeing Layla's misunderstanding.", "My boyfriend and I had talked about not wanting them to attend anymore but we hadn\u2019t thought about them thinking it was a standing invitation so we weren\u2019t on the same page in the moment.\n\nOur friend let them in and when I saw them, I just wasn\u2019t going to say anything and then speak to Layla after. Meanwhile, my boyfriend was silently waiting for me to address it in the moment and when I didn\u2019t, he thought that meant I was waiting for him to handle it.", "One would think. This is why I always encourage over-communicating.", "You both need to address this with Layla asap. Also call her out on telling your old friend group cause she obviously didn\u2019t tell them the full story."]}
