The way I understand it is that Jen never before made a big deal about you seeing anyone. There is no history of her spying on you or going through your social media. It probably is true that she found out about you and Mia because Mia told her. \nThis is where Mia could be TA. If there is bad blood between the women because of reasons in the past, it is possible that Mia is in fact talking about you just to piss off Jen. \nYou don't have to stop dating Mia to do Jen a favor, but you might not want to be with a toxic person. Keep your eyes and ears open, maybe ask Mia about Jen and see how healthy her response/attitude is.", "If Jen is telling the truth then I see this as a red flag for Mia, and I would consider cutting ties just for that reason.\n\nI don't think you're the AH until you find out if there's any truth to what Jen is saying.", "I mean, you're NTA as you can date/hook up with who you like - but from the sounds of it Mia is not a very pleasant person. If you're cool with dating someone spiteful then fine, but remember that her malicious behaviour might end up directed at you some day.", "What are you going to do when you find out MIA is doing this just because she doesn\u2019t like JEN & then once that power play is over MIA leaves you & you\u2019ve burned that bridge with JEN. \ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffc\n\nI think there\u2019s A LOT more to the story here on Mia\u2019s part.", "Eh.  NTA, but I'm going to second a lot of the other commenters: Mia is NOT a nice person, and if you want to keep getting that strange knowing that, it's your own funeral.  There are a lot of women out there who are good at sex and aren't petty enough to rub it in your ex's face.", "You can date who you want but you've just learned that Mia is a spiteful person. Have you talked with Mia about your kid free stance?\n\nI hope you are really good about birth control because I have a feeling you'll be \"accidentally\" having a kid with Mia within a few weeks.", "Did Mia deliberately search you out?  How far does she live from your local coffee shop. \n\nShe might be wanting to piss off your ex.", "NTA. But it seems like Mia is talking about you on purpouse or might have even started seeing you just to piss off your stb ex, *especially* since she didn't care about you hooking up with someone and could have only known by Mia telling her. Maybe suggest Jen to report Mia to HR if she didn't do that already and question if you want to be with someone, even just for sex, who bullies a person close to you", "Mia sounds like the AH here. I would be cautious \u26a0\ufe0f with her. When the sex becomes boring, and you guys break up imagine all the shit she will talk about you.", "Do you believe Jen is telling the truth?\n\nIf so, YTA. Why hook up with someone who behaves that way?", "From how it sounds, Mia may have intentionally sought you out to spite Jen. If she didn't, she certainly seems to be now. Good sex or not, she sounds pretty petty and you're allowing her to effect your relationship with your ex. \n\nYTA.. It's not unreasonable for got ex to not want her private life to effect her work and this new g/f is doing just that.", "NTA\n\nYou guys split up..  however if Mia is intentionally taunting Jen, you should consider her (true) motive for seeing you..", "info: when you met Mia, which of you initiated the conversation?", "YTA- Idk if you're hurt or if there's more to the story than just the kid issue being the reason for the separation, but you don't talk about your ex with even a hint of her being someone that you cared about, loved, spent your life with etc. You're right you 100% don't have to live your life based off the way your ex feels about something. But if your stance is that where you currently you dick is more important than the preventing this shit your ex is having to deal with because of it, yeah that's an asshole move. further more, why would you not explicitly tell 'mia' that her behavior is both childish and unacceptable? that's rhetorical, it's obvious where your priorities lie", "NTA - You would not of been aware that she was your ex-wife to be coworker.", "YTA for hooking up with such a shitty person.", "YTA", "NTA \nAren\u2019t we all supposed to put sex before ex?", "YTA- \n\nYou're now affecting Jen's professional life. \n\nYou need to draw hard boundaries with M in regards if she wants to keep seeing you, not to talk about you au work. Jen can use this in court against you as harassment/ mental anguish. You're dating someone from her WORKPLACE.  do you know how you'd 1) makes you look in court and 2) makws you look to the rest of the world?  Yea you didn't know, but ignorance is no defense. M needs to STFU about crap she's not involved with and keep her mouth shut about you at work, and you need to tell her that to ensure a smooth, amicable divorce. Prenup or not, M has put you in a very BAD position here simply out of her own spite.", "YTA.\n\nYou\u2019re right, your ex-wife doesn\u2019t get to tell you what to do, but that isn\u2019t her point. This is something that could change her life in a positive way, and that you\u2019d rather take the position of an oppositional teenager of \u201cI don\u2019t have to listen to you\u201d is wild.\n\nThis was your wife, and she\u2019s right - you\u2019ve decided her uncomfortable experience is worth your casual sex. Not to mention that Mia sounds like a real piece of work that she\u2019s talking about you just to upset your ex-wife.\n\nYou\u2019re on the wrong side of this one, man.", "NtA, she's a female wanting to try for kids, you split amicably because of this. why would Mia talking about you even upset her? she left for greener pastures\n\nedit: op and the ex don't have kids together. what exactly is the obligation here?", "You're not responsible for this woman's awful behavior, but you are complicit in it. YTA.", "Lol NTA. Props to Mis if she does have alterior motives and it\u2019s not just Jen being hella insecure of her ex moving on before her during the girl talk lmao", "YTA. Can you not thing without our dick? once?", "Of course YTA. You are effecting your exes professional life and you're so easily manipulated with sex you don't care if it's morally wrong or not. You and Mia are both shitty people. I would normally say date who you want but you have said Jen has been amicable through all of this. Amicable or not divorce is difficult and now Jen has to go to work everyday being taunted by an adult bully and you are allowing it to continue. I'm glad Jen is getting away from you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You do not need that drama.", "Just a word of caution in reference to the 'Iron Clad Prenup'. I live in Virginia. After 20 years the soon to be Ex decided it was time to kick me to the curb, with PREJUDICE. She stripped my financial gears and left me with a permanent distrust. \n\nSo when the smoke had cleared, the law firm representing me invited me in for a counseling session on planning the future. It was gratis but as you and I know, it was already built into their fees.\n\nAnyway one of the questions went like this, \"Do you plan to remarry in the future?\"\n\nMy reply was, \"If I do, then I will have the PRENUP from Hell!\"\n\nThe lawyer's reply convinced me to turn to immorality.  It went like this. In Virginia Courts, the judge has the discretion to toss any or all of any prenup that in his/her opinion is unfair. \n\nSo my reaction, if a woman wants to play house, she can stop by my place and we can have whatever fun that old folks engage for pleasure. But there is no way this side of, well you get my drift,  that I will ever apply for, let alone sign, a document that will create a marital contract of any description.
