Pre-Disagreement Facts:\n\n* I (M43) and separated and living apart from my wife \"Jen\" (F42, fake name)\n* She asked for the divorce, we're working with a mediator\n* No cheating, mistreatments, etc.  She wants a kid, I don't\n* Iron-clad Prenup, uncontested\n* ***After*** Jen moved out and the divorce started, I started dating/hooking up with other women, which she didn't care about\n\nJen decided after a number of years she needed to try for a kid and we ended up separating.  We're generally amicable as we go through the process, but something came up and she's really pissed at me.\n\nA few weeks ago I met a woman (\"Mia\" early 30's, fake name) at my local coffee shop and started hooking up with her regularly, because the sex is really, really good.  A few days ago I get a call from Jen asking if I'm seeing Mia, which I find odd since she's not asked about anyone before and I have no idea how she'd know that.  Jen included a picture of Mia, so I said yes, and asked how she knew and why she was asking.\n\nTurns out, unbeknownst to me, they work together, in adjacent departments.  And they don't seem to like each other very much.  Jen asked me to stop seeing her, to which I refused.  Her claim is that Mia is intentionally talking about me to piss her off, embarrass her, etc. and asked if I would do it as a favor.  Again, I refused, citing I had no prior knowledge, and while I don't want to hurt her intentionally and wouldn't have started seeing Mia if I had known, I'm not ending it now, and she no longer gets a say who I have sex with.  Jen called me an AH for putting sex above her, I disagree.\n\nI get that she's upset, but I don't feel like I should have to alter my life around her feelings anymore.  So, AITA?\n\nEdited for typos, added approximate age for Mia.\n\nEdit for some common questions:\n\n* Mia is also Child Free, had her tubes tied/removed (verified on her social posts from years ago when she did it)\n* Mia also lives near the coffee shop, she's a regular too, but at a different time of day (we both are greeted by name by the staff)\n* Mia never brings up Jen to me, never does the \"Am I better than your ex?\" stuff\n* Jen learned of this from Mia talking to her own work friends, someone saw a pic of me and made the connection, and it got back to Jen, Mia never sought her out (per Jen)\n* Mia refuses to stop talking to her friends about me at work, but it keeps getting back to Jen indirectly, even after Jen asked Mia not to anymore (Per Jen, and this is why she feels she's now doing it to piss her off)\n* I have not talked to Mia about Jen, but am considering it based on some comments, but very hesitant\n* I actually like Mia the more I get to know her, we have a lot in common besides just great sex\n\nHope the edit helps!", "created_utc": 1696063642, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16w1rpc/aita_inconsiderate_towards_soontobe_ex/", "score": 262, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The way I understand it is that Jen never before made a big deal about you seeing anyone. There is no history of her spying on you or going through your social media.

If there is bad blood between the women because of reasons in the past, it is possible that Mia is in fact talking about you just to piss off Jen. \nYou don't have to stop dating Mia to do Jen a favor, but you might not want to be with a toxic person.

Why hook up with someone who behaves that way?", "From how it sounds, Mia may have intentionally sought you out to spite Jen. If she didn't, she certainly seems to be now. Good sex or not, she sounds pretty petty and you're allowing her to effect your relationship with your ex. \n\nYTA.. It's not unreasonable for your ex to not want her private life to effect her work and this new g/f is doing just that. \n\nUpdate: Ok, maybe you're NTA, Mia is..

But if your stance is that where you currently you dick is more important than the preventing this shit your ex is having to deal with because of it, yeah that's an asshole move. further more, why would you not explicitly tell 'mia' that her behavior is both childish and unacceptable? that's rhetorical, it's obvious where your priorities lie", "NTA - You would not of been aware that she was your ex-wife to be coworker.", "YTA for hooking up with such a shitty person.", "YTA", "NTA \nAren\u2019t we all supposed to put sex before ex?", "YTA- \n\nYou're now affecting Jen's professional life. \n\nYou need to draw hard boundaries with M in regards if she wants to keep seeing you, not to talk about you au work.

You're dating someone from her WORKPLACE.  do you know how you'd 1) makes you look in court and 2) makws you look to the rest of the world?  Yea you didn't know, but ignorance is no defense.

Can you not thing without our dick? once?", "Of course YTA. You are effecting your exes professional life and you're so easily manipulated with sex you don't care if it's morally wrong or not. You and Mia are both shitty people. I would normally say date who you want but you have said Jen has been amicable through all of this.

After 20 years the soon to be Ex decided it was time to kick me to the curb, with PREJUDICE. She stripped my financial gears and left me with a permanent distrust. \n\nSo when the smoke had cleared, the law firm representing me invited me in for a counseling session on planning the future.

It went like this. In Virginia Courts, the judge has the discretion to toss any or all of any prenup that in his/her opinion is unfair. \n\nSo my reaction, if a woman wants to play house, she can stop by my place and we can have whatever fun that old folks engage for pleasure.

Either Mia has to grow up and shut up about their weekends experimenting with the Kamasutra, or he has to break the connection by breaking it off. In the original post, Mia was the asshole. But OP said she refuses to stop talking about it. Now it's up to him.", "On the surface this seems to be a bit more nuanced than I thought at first. But a few things itch my brain, and not in a good way. \nFirst of all, why would bringing up Jen mess up what you have with Mia? You don't have to interrogate her, but just a \"oh I know someone who also works at X, do you know her?\" See where the converstaion goes. \n\nSecond: it's ok to tell your coworkers about a date or an activity. But it is weird to tell them about sexual details. This is something you maybe discuss with friends, not at work. \n\nThird: maybe Mia didn't know about the connection at first. But she does now. And not only does she refuse to stop talking about it, she could also limit who she tells and only confide in people who keep their mouth shut at the water cooler. She doesn't because she doesn't care. Even if this is all a weird coincidence, that alone would be a red flag to me. \n\nAnd last: apparently another co-worker recognized you as Jens ex from a picture. So there are some (a lot?) of co-workers who know who you are. Mia could still be one of them. You also met at a place where you are a regular. In itself this doesn't have to mean anything, but the option of her knowing who you were and even on purpose flirting with you is still there. \n\nYou're the only one who can add everything up and see if there are other red flags. Don't let the amazing sex cloud your judgement. This is often a red flag in itself. Good luck!", "I feel like if it\u2019s truly an amicable divorce, why not show some consideration to the person you were married too?", "Not forever.

But talking about the great sex you have with your new guy *in the office* is actually super inappropriate behaviour. It\u2019s not a bar or restaurant, it\u2019s their workplace. Especially now that she knows the guy\u2019s ex is also in her workplace. The fact that she won\u2019t stop talking about it (she\u2019s vocal enough about it that it turns in office gossip and she is aware that it does. This is different than just talking about it with friends) is probably intentional. It sounds like a power play now. And she\u2019s talking about *your* sex life too. What if things start going not so great and that makes it to her little audience too. Are you okay with that? You might want to think about your own boundaries in this situation. \n\nYou are NTA.
