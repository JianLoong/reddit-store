Sad really", "Can you spell out what you think the point is? \n\nPersonally in regards to this story the wife's reason was pretty weak for me. If I was the husband i'd be pretty annoyed maybe even upset at the reasoning for barring my brother.

Not escalate the communication, not make it clear she feels disrespected, not any of dozens other reasonable courses of action. It was a weird manipulation that was incredibly blatant even by her own admission. She knew he would make a comment, she was baiting it, and she changed her behavior only to cause that specific drama.
