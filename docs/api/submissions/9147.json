Do you think maintaining a relationship with someone is physically impossible without cohabitation?", "I mean, no, she did not. They\u2019re grown adults and they chose to engage in an argument. Husband could have just respected her and she never would have needed to take such extreme measures.", "Depends on the thing and the friend. There are friends I have that no matter how decent someone is to me, if they are shitty to my friend then I\u2019ll cut them off.", "There\u2019s a MASSIVE difference between being welcome in someone\u2019s home and staying there for multiple days. It\u2019s her house, too. She has every right to say she doesn\u2019t want her bil staying for days.", "This", "I think she messed up by getting dressed as soon as she got her way. From how it reads, that is the sticking point.\n\nHE is the AH, and he shares it with his brother. I think what she did is funny. Sad that it came to that, but funny.\n\nI am now going to ask my wife, who I have to invite over to make her walk around in her underwear. Lol", "Options:\n\n1. Live with it.\n2. Go to a hotel.\n3. Take a weekend trip somewhere fun.\n\nYou can't control what others do, only what you do.\n\nThere's nothing respectable about trying to annoy your spouse into what you want them to do. That's some nasty martyr bullshit.", "My partner and I have a very healthy, communication-based relationship. We would not trample over one another's feelings like OP's husband did, but, if we absolutely had to host someone my SO hates, they would stay with their mom for a few days no problem and, if I was the one who hates the guest, I'd do the same.", "Autism will do that.", "She seemed annoyed that he was even at their house. As far as I can see he did nothing to OP. I hope if OP invites her mother, sister, father, or brother over her husband walks around bare naked with cereal over his body. Maybe then she\u2019ll realize she\u2019s quite silly", "I believe purposefully driving your partners family away who as far as we can see has done nothing wrong to you is a good way to get a divorce quickly", "She wanted that. She did that deliberately.\n\nShe's a bit of an asshole for that.", "Not a friend though, it's a brother.\n\nAnd apparantlybhe cheated on the fiend ,op said in another post.", "They used to be close and now she doesn't want him around over some drama with her friend. How does that trump her husband's relationship with his brother?", "Of course she was going to get dressed when he left. That was the whole point in undressing. Get him to leave, job done. She\u2019s funny af \ud83d\ude02", "She shouldn't have to leave because there's an unwanted guest in her own home. Ok buddy. Have a good night/morning/whatever the fuck.", "\"if we absolutely had to\" is the key phrase. In this case, there was no such need for the BIL to stay over. Send him to the hotel.", "I can understand that. I'm autistic too. The gag was your opinion makes so little sense only the BiL would have the nerve to say it", "[removed]", "A person doesn't have to do anything wrong for you to not want them to move into your house. Nobody in my partner's family has done anything wrong and yet I wouldn't want to live with a single one of them. Staying the night? Sure. Saying the weekend? Sure. Living with me? No. No to every single one of them. That goes for my family too btw. Sorry not sorry. I would absolutely divorce someone who moved anyone into my house when I said know as if I have no say over my own living arrangements. This is a 2 yes situation. I wouldn't be with someone who can't respect a no.", "Brother could be racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. All sorts of valid reasons to cut someone off regardless of the former closeness of the relationship.", "It doesn\u2019t, but her husband doesn\u2019t need his brother to stay in their house against her wishes to have a relationship with him. \n\nAlso, no, she\u2019s justifiably upset with BIL by the sounds of how he talks to her. Husband is at fault here for enforcing respect of his wife.", "I agree! I think the husband is in the wrong too. I think he could have met his brother's place, stayed at a hotel with the brother or whatever. I just think OP chose a very... odd way to solve the problem by causing more problem and more friction. Two wrongs don't make a right.", "LoL what a fantastic comment exchange.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Did you read the post? He\u2019s there to discuss things with OP\u2019s husband, not to live there", "So to be clear do you think you only have the right to say no to someone staying in your house if they have done something wrong? Otherwise you don't have that right at all? Or is this specifically that you can only say no to family if they have done something wrong otherwise you don't have that right at all? And how \"wrong\" do they have to be? Does making constant sarcastic comments that rub you that wrong way count as \"wrong\" or do they have to punch you in the face for you to be granted the right of a say over your own home?", "I guess I skimmed it. But just because I'm comfortable with having someone stay the weekend doesn't mean everyone is. She isn't. She said no. And he did it anyway."]}
