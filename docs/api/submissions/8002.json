Tell her the actual Christian concept of God says to love others and not be a dick.  She doesn't even respect her own religion.\n\nAnd find better friends, good luck.", "NTA. You're supposed to respect her views while she repeatedly disrespects you? I don't think so.", "NTA. I am sorry to say this, but she is no longer your friend. As far as your other friends go - how can they say you have to respect her views when she won\u2019t respect yours? (She literally said your views don\u2019t matter) \n\nYou are 100% correct in this. There is no reason why your friend\u2019s views are better than yours just because someone why stands up on Sunday morning told them to her. It sounds like you need better friends.", "NTA and it sounds like none of your friends respect you as a person, unfortunately. I\u2019m really sorry you are experiencing this, but there are good people out there who will want to know you as a complete person. Find them! You deserve better.", "NTA.\nTl;dr fuck your friend\n\n  Her existence as a human being is worth a base level of respect.  Her ideas and beliefs do not stand on their own merits, and don't gain any respect until she can present a reasonable and sound argument backed by predictive power.  Is your friend required to be respectful of my assertion that she is at this point actively choosing to identify herself with the biggest child sexual abuse ring in the history of humanity?  I'd bet not.  You do have some requirement to respect her choice for herself not to be gay, but that goes both ways and she seems to be just fine crossing that line.  She is no longer participating in witnessing or Christianity, but merely religiosity at this point.\n\nI'd wonder if the friend group can see past their own noses far enough to realize that this person is actively disrespecting your own life choices to demand that you conform to hers.  Imagine how they'd feel if you swapped gay and straight in her own argument and fed it back to them repeatedly.  \n\nI could go for days on this.  Homosexuality isn't in the Bible until like a 1940s translation, the gospels' depiction of jesus christ himself never demands obedience to god, but only presents his message and presents the option, and then theres the whole part where there is just genuinely no real evidence for a god.  Judas himself was left alone by the jesus and the disciples and dealt with by god himself.  So either the bible is correct and god can handle his own shit, or it would seem he's so weak that she needs to step in for him because your lack belief is just overpowering her deity.  \n\nJohn 1:12\u201313\nBut to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.\n\nThis heavily implies that the works and intentions of people are not what saves, rather the work of god alone.  Her \"good works\" of harassing you with her personal beliefs don't save you.  god does\n\nEphesians 2:8-10\nFor it is by grace you have been saved, through faith\u2014and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of god\u2014not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God\u2019s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.\n\nThis outright states that pretending really hard to be straight wont even save you, and that the point is to be saved in order to do good works.  Your sexual preferences are irrelevant to making the leap of \"being saved\"  maybe if your friend displayed some of the fruits of the spirit such as peace, patience, kindness, generosity, gentleness, and self-control she would have a better chance at displaying the light of jesus over the long term that might draw you in from the darkness of sin and then the conviction of jesus would surely cause you to want to rectify whatever problems jesus supposedly has with you.\n\nPersonally, if she's this assertive about you living her faith I'd just cut contact completely.  Sorry so long, I grew up fundie and spent a lot of time on these situations when I was deconverting.", "NTA, ditch her. Oh and she\u2019s calling you every name in the book? Sounds very Christian indeed. She sucks.", "NTA. Your friend shouldn't force their views on you if they aren't respecting your views", "NTA. She's the one trying to change you. You're just unbothered trying to live life.", "NTA you don't have to respect the views of anyone who treats you as less of a person or somehow \"wrong\" for an intrinsic part of you. You didn't try to keep the friendship close or keep her from distancing herself, she's the one who escalated by inviting you to church and then saying that *her* God says that *you* can't be gay. That's not asking you to respect her views, that's trying to force you to agree with her views.", "You should not apologize. In fact, not even Jesus said that being gay is wrong, it was Paul, lol. Tell your friend to know her religion!\n\nBut yeah, it is not healthy to have a relationship with someone who wants to change something that is completely fine. It's not worth it.", "NTA - sometimes respect means giving somebody space instead of trying to change them. You\u2019re not trying to make her change her views, you\u2019re just refusing to pretend to change something that is a fundamental part of who you are (and can\u2019t be changed anyway) just to adhere to what she demands of you on behalf of a community you\u2019re not even part of.", "NTA. As a Christian myself, I never believe it\u2019s right to force beliefs on someone. You can have differing opinions and can share them (1 free pass), but once you keep pushing it essentially you cross the line. They say as a Christian you\u2019re supposed to share the gospel yada yada, but at this age if you haven\u2019t heard about JC then you must be living under a rock. Most people heard of him and if y\u2019all don\u2019t care about Christianity or any other religion, so be it. My mom is also a Christian and both her younger sisters are lesbians and she doesn\u2019t say anything at all. And, never will.", "What happened to judge not least ye be judged? This person is not your friend OP, she doesn\u2019t care about you. Your friends suck too. She\u2019s pushing her bigoted religion on you, shaming you for existing and she expects you to just take it? She\u2019s toxic, dump her.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is classic bigot sophistry. You're asking her to respect your view, which means you get to continue being bisexual in the world, and she's asking you to respect her views, which means you don't get to continue being bisexual in the world. Completely different levels of compulsion and interference, but she's convinced herself they're equivalent.", "nta, you life, your beliefs your choise!!!! don't spend a minute feeling guilty! you are free to decide who you are gonna spend your time with, there was no friendship between two of you when  she started to judge you, her life her beliefs too but ur not going to force your beliefs  on her as she does!", "She doesn\u2019t respect your views, so why should you respect hers?  I have friends with different political or religious views, but they don\u2019t try to convince me they\u2019re right. \nNTA.  People who try to bully you into accepting their worldview aren\u2019t true friends and do not deserve your respect.", "NTA. She's not your friend (and it sounds like your other \"friends\" aren't either).", "Yes you have a duty to explain that jesus died for our sins. If she loves Jesus she cant let him die in vain. So if she wants you to be Christian you have a moral duty to sin whenever you can. Otherwise it will be super awkward when she dies or he will just send her directly to hell for the betrayal.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
