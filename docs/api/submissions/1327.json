Plus I don't want him getting the wrong idea because I don't like him in that way. I felt he was becoming manic and really attached to me. He said he was sorry and I haven't heard from him since.

At some point you\u2019re going to break away from the group anyway. No one likes to suffer the company of an unrequited crush. The fact that you don\u2019t want to go is all the convincing you need that you shouldn\u2019t go.", "NTA. It sends a much worse message if you do go - that he might have a chance, because you showed up for him on his special day. \n\nCan you talk to Emma and explain how intense his crush has been?", "Don't go. You can't make it, youbalready had plans, you need more lead time in future, whatever. Although,.depending on what Emma is like, you could tell her the truth so that she can leave you out in the future if he keeps acting obsessed. But only if you think she can be sympathetic.", "NTA.\n\nYou aren't really under an obligation to accept these kinds of invitations if you don't feel like going.  Say no, you can't make it, or something like that.  Short and sweet.  Or, since you've already said you're \"iffy\" just leave it at that.", "NTA - do what ever you want to do.  You don't need to feel guilty if you want to avoid someone who makes you uncomfortable.  Sometimes you need a mental health day, do not feel bad about it.  Good luck!", "NTA\n\nNever feel guilty for hurting a creep's feelings. He may be depressed, but that isn't your problem to solve as someone he was targeting with inappropriate behavior. I think not going to his birthday will send the message he needs to hear. He isn't special to you, and it is perfectly normal and reasonable to avoid someone who doesn't take the hint like this.", "NTA. Just let people know it was last second and you are not free. Use a \"family obligation\" or something like that if people insist on a reason. However, no is a complete sentence and you never have to give anyone a reason.", "These are last minute plans, if anyone asks it's as simple as letting them know you didn't want to or couldn't change your schedule to accommodate these plans and next time they should plan further in advanced. NTA", "NTA\n\nHaving such an intense crush on you for 5 years seems unusual to me. Usually someone would move on after realizing the person doesn\u2019t really act that way back. I think it would be better for you and him if you didn\u2019t go. I would just say you already have other plans you can\u2019t skip out on but still wish him a happy birthday.", "NTA and honestly I would avoid him at all costs. He sounds dangerous", "NTA\n\nDon't go if you don't want to, you don't need and excuse to not want to do something you are uncomfortable with. Shane is crossing boundaries with his excessive texting and texting your sister too.", "NTA. Stay home. Just let your friend know that you just can't make it that night.", "I thought about talking to Emma but she is really vocal and confrontational- has no filter- and I am worried she is going to make it worse.", "I'll text him a happy birthday in the group chat we are in with Emma (which he has also stopped responding in). I am not texting him anything 1 on 1 because that might open another channel of communication again that I just do not want.", "I didn\u2019t mean you should text him 1 on 1 or anything. Just meant act cordial, don\u2019t actively avoid or ignore, but decline."]}
