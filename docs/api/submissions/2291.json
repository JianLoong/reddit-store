My grandfather lived with us, so he moved there with them, his other child\u2019s family just wasn\u2019t set up for him to move in with them. My parents offered that I could move there with them, but I declined, since I would have known no one there - it was basically a retirement community made up of modest single family homes - and had a good network where I was, but also because it was kind of in the middle of nowhere. I honestly think that one of the things that significantly contributed to my father\u2019s rapid decline in health - he died less than 6 years after the move, while having been in pretty good health doing a job that required a good amount of physical activities - was becoming isolated, he went from taking the subway every day, walking through the city, stopping in book stores and the like, to sitting around on the couch, watching tv, and pretty much doing nothing else.

When they moved, they moved away from my partner\u2019s grandmother who was at that time in an assisted living facility.

I need you to stop\"", "That doesn\u2019t work if MIL offers to pay OP\u2019s current salary if they move so she can stay home with the baby and not be an awful working mom. My MIL straight up told me she\u2019d pay me my salary if I\u2019d quit so my daughter wouldn\u2019t have to go to daycare.", "It absolutely matters.", "Why? It was clearly one of the factors that OP considered not ideal", "It\u2019s not a nice gesture, no. It\u2019s condescending and self-serving. First, they shit on their apartment and state, and then throw an absolute fit when OP and husband decline an offer that they clearly primarily made out of self-interest, rather than any actual consideration of what their son and DIL might want.", "Strings made of steel.\n\nOP, don't do it. Let the guilt *go*.", "Yup, which makes it no longer a gift. And I'm guessing one of the worst strings will be the MIL trying to butt in and raise OP's kids the \"right way\" ~*barf*~ based on how the she's talking about things. \n\nSounds like OP's husband is in agreement, but he should be the one exclusively declining the offer as it's his mother (or parents). Plus, there's really zero chance he would be attacked a similar way OP has been (e.g. \"terrible father\") if he were the only one seen as involved: \n\n>All her friends are backing her up in the comments about how I\u2019ll be a terrible mother", "Oh absolutely. What's laughable is the mother-in-law rallying the troops for support like OP and her husband don't have a support system where they are (also, note how the criticism is about how the DIL will be the bad parent, not the son/actual other parent of the child). I mean, nothing says 'come raise your child in a place that does not reflect your values, doesn't care about your health, and is isolated from your friends, family and career opportunities' like a social media campaign of bored biddies clicking their tongues. Like, 'Oh NO! My mother-in-law's former chiropractor doesn't like me! This changes everything! I must move NOW!'  \n\n\nOP, NTA. Everyone telling you that a 'gift' like this has strings attached is correct. Take a good, long look at everything they're posting, then take screenshots. Next time you're even remotely feeling guilty, take a look at what these people are saying and know that you're right to keep away. Personally, my petty self would be broadcasting how  MIL was attempting to cyberbully me for the perfectly logical decision to stay where you want to live (I'm thinking screenshots as Christmas cards, but I'm evil). I mean, if you're going to publicly try to pull a move like this and publicly bash a pregnant woman, you deserve the consequences.", "I was with you up until the gay comment. I live in a deep red state and have plenty of gay friends. We even have gay bars here", "My gosh I would LOVE to live in NYC.", "Just left Florida for the northeast two months ago. Best decision we ever made.", "And they really think that the birth place of Florida Man is safer?", "Ugh. Can you imagine raising a daughter in Florida by choice? You sound like a wise woman who will be a great mother.", "My daughter (32) has lived in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn for 10 years and just bought a co-op! We are so proud of her and she will NEVER leave Bay Ridge. Says she loves the inclusivity and acceptance in NYC. Too loud for me, but we are in Buffalo. Snow melts; doesn't suck your home away in winds or burn it to the ground or flood it out. Stand. Your. Ground, OP. You rock for your daughter!", "NTA \n\nComing from a teen thats growing up in nyc: if given the option no way in hell would i relocate my family\u2014 and especially not for a deep red state with such questionable in-laws. sending love", "NYC is awesome. I love being able to walk to so many places.  I have membership to the zoo and take my kids all the time. There are so many fun things to do and if nothing else, we can walk to a number of playgrounds from where I live. Also we have free 3k (if it doesn't run out of money) and prek. Also you get paid family leave here (I hope you both qualify for it!). I got to take 18 weeks with my first baby and  20 weeks with my second.", "I'm from Michigan (currently living in Austin, Texas).   \nYou made the right choice for you & your daughter. Red states are making horrible political decisions for women, children & LBGT+ community.\n\nLet the worry wash away. You will be a great mom.   \nYour MIL's issues are her problem. \n\nJust follow your gut & stay where you have support.", "OP, be thankful she moved away before your baby was born.  I think I\u2019d limit my visits to them to once a year at most.  It sounds like your husband has your back and I hope it stays that way.  \n\nNTA by the way.  If she was truly worried about the size of your apartment, she\u2019d offer the money for a bigger one there.", "So many strings of steel that it's actually just a cage.", "Yup, and it's not even really \"strings attached\" in the typical sense (which is that \\*later on\\* they're gonna start pulling strings). In this case, accepting the gift immediately means a massive change in OP's life.", "I like you.\n\nChristmas cards are brilliant.\n\nOP, I'll design them if you want.", "I would be sending her weekly 'florida man' links..", "Don't forget those of us fighting from the inside!", "There are some parts of NY that are just as bad as a red state. Stay in the city.", "Rochester housing market never got as crazy as other places\nI can understand worrying about big city real estate prices even not worrying about the other elements", "Buffalo is amazing though \ud83d\ude0a", "Manhattan is busy enough when passing through it in the middle of the night while traveling, I wonder if it would be too much of a crowd all the time during the day\nWhatever part of NYS, yeah the blizzards suck but we rarely ever have hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, etc. Hurricane Sandy seems like a rare exception, most of the few hurricanes that make it up this far are degraded to bad rainstorms; the Mount Morris Dam has done wonders for controlling flooding along the Genesee River", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f I will. If you ever see a chubby Irish woman sobbing into a corned beef sandwich in central park you know it's me lol", "I think this goes beyond manipulation to straight bullying. She tried to force them into taking something they didn\u2019t want and after as punishment she wanted to hurt and humiliate them by having others say terrible things about them online. It\u2019s like middle school. Personally I would go in the offensive but at least they know to Never move near these ppl.\nEdit sentence", "Yeah, states known for liberal cities have conservative rural areas like other states, and some rightwing cityfolk, and a mix in the suburbs", "While that is very true, at least in a blue state you have recourse to the law; in red states, those protective laws don't even exist.", "Yeah, although this Schenectady girl never thought I'd be here! Same snow though, really.", "Yeah sure, like that only happens the one time.  :)  \n\n\nSorry for your loss, go get that beef.", "I think you are connecting dots to create a big political picture in your head to make you seem elite and intelligent. Something that is politically motivated means something is done in the interest of a political party. So, if this was politically motivated, grandma only wants them to move to her town to vote \u201cred\u201d.   \n\nOtherwise, she just wants her family safe and close to her.", "If you live outside of the internet, reality says otherwise compared to your limited understanding of the city based on hearsay and poor grasp of statistics.", "And depending on which red state - crime is worse here.  I live in Louisiana, people are terrified of this place, full on clutched pearls, never leave their house, cancel their plans in New Orleans terrified.  \n\nNow I don\u2019t know if this is the red state in question, but I\u2019d be deeply curious about this \u201csafer\u201d red state\u2026"]}
