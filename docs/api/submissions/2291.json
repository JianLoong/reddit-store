If they have done something like moved to The Villages in Florida, they are now surrounded by others who would rather sacrifice their autonomy for the implied security of authoritarian leadership.  I live in Florida so I feel it's my right to observe.  That like minded community helps shift attitudes to an even more authoritarian mindset since we, as social creatures, tend to fit into our local community.\n\nAll of this is to get to the point that the use of carrot and stick to \"encourage\" your family to move, is in itself a manifestation of an authoritarian attitude.  It is designed to play against your desire for fair play by keeping his parents in your lives. The choice was theirs but they want their cake and eat it too.\n\nI hope you can reach a place of peace.  I am sure I would not want the behavior displayed by MIL and Co. as a primary influence in my child's life.  It feels like a bullet well dodged to me, but it's your peace that you need to find.", "NTA they are acting selfish and short sighted.\nI am not American so I don't fully understand the political stuff but how are you expected to support yourselves in a new place?\nWho expects someone to quit their job and move to be near them?\nWhy is their family more important than yours? They chose to move.", "What kind of grandma endangers her grandchild by stressing out the mother so horribly!!! Get your family and friends to comment THAT on her post!!!", "NTA. If you aren\u2019t relieved over your decision to avoid this disastrous set up at least a thousand times over, literally, I\u2019d be utterly shocked.", "NTA....better to live where you want to and can pursue your life's objectives than to have strings dangling by accepting a down payment for a house you may not want in the future.   It's better to do it on your own.   Sounds like the cost of this may be too high for you if they control the outcome.", "NTA, of thos was truly about gifting their grandchild a home it wouldn't matter to them where the home is. This isn't a gift it's a leash and if you accept it they will step over every boundary you try to place. Your husband knows what they're trying to do which is why he's saying to ignore them. I'd suggest for your own mental health is to silence them on social media so you don't see what they're writing anymore", "NTA This doesn\u2019t sound like a person you want to live near, for many reasons.  Her posing it as a generous gift is ridiculous when it\u2019s clear it\u2019s all about her.  Please do what you have to do to tune her out.  Block her on fb, etc.  Don\u2019t let yourself be stressed when you\u2019re pregnant.  And it\u2019s really great that you have your hubby\u2019s support.  Let her go upset herself down south as much as she wants to while you and your hubs look forward to bringing your baby into your cozy love nest in peace.", "NTA, at least your daughter has rights to her body in your state.", "NAH. \n\nIt\u2019s a nice gesture and it\u2019s probably easier to access the real estate market in that area versus in the notoriously expensive real estate in NYC. You could have at least made a show of considering it before declining. \n\nWhat does your husband think? Would he mind being closer to his parents and grandparents?", "OP, you misspelled your title.  It should have read \"AITA for not letting my MIL blackmail me, DH and my unborn daughter into leaving everything we love to live in the house next to them,  in a red-state I never want to live in, let alone raise a daughter in?\" NTA", "This! Also, it\u2019s pretty clear that the in-laws have different beliefs than OP and her husband, if they think a deep red state is preferable to NY. This would only be the beginning of the friction every single time OP made a parenting decision they disagreed with. Plus no one knows who a kid will grow up to be when they are born. What if they\u2019re gay? Living in a deep red state could cause them emotional harm. \n\nNever accept a gift with strings attached, and this one is connected to a time bomb just waiting to detonate.", "Yeah, there are definitely strings attached to this gift", "If it was really about ensuring they weren\u2019t in a \u201ctiny\u201d home they would offer that money as a down payment of a property that was in a location of their choice.", "You're right, if it was a gift they would offer that money for ANYTHING, which would give them a leg up in life.\n\nNTA", ">I wouldn't be letting someone around my kid of they were so easily willing to trash talk me\n\nExactly! Is MIL going to lose her mind *every time* she doesn't get her way?\n\nIs she going to **insist** that every single Birthday, Mother's Day and Christmas /u/nothanksmoving and her husband fly to Florida with the baby?\n\nIs she going to throw a fit when they say no, and take to social media to insult them? Is she going to ride the \"You're a bad parent!\" train all the way to calling CPS, because they won't do things her way?\n\nThis needs to be nipped in the bud right now. Strong boundaries.", "It was", "He has a great job here that he loves and has no interest in moving. Didn\u2019t want to give her false hope or think think she could convince us.", "Not to mention, what about you being close to YOUR family, not just your mil \ud83d\ude11", "If she's this bad when you're states apart, imagine how great she'll be when you move to a home she and FIL \"paid for\", which she will totally have keys to.  You may decide to move, but don't go for this nonsense.   And it's great _her_ friends support her : D  But that shouldn't mean much to you in this case.  NTA.", "If your inlaws for some reason decide to move to nyc then, if I were you that would be my cue to move. iirc NYC has grandparent rights so I would be wary of that and maybe double check the laws just in case.", "We moved to Texas 11 years ago for a grandchild. That was all wonderful and then her parents divorced and things changed. We came back east a month ago and I have never been happier to be anywhere, high taxes and all. We're in the Hudson Valley and we can actually get the bread we like, people act the same way that we do, we're home.\n\nStay where you're happy. And as has been said, if she were really worried about your child being safe there are plenty of places right near you that aren't dangerous.\n\nNTA.", "Which is pretty funny considering that 2020 data shows that Red States have the highest murder rates.  \n\nNTA and I would just ignore your MIL on this.\n\nETA, Florida, 5.9 murders per 100K with 1290 murders.  New York, 4.2 per 100k with 808 murders.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss. However you should still go and do it in his honor.  Sending a hug from an internet stranger.", "Literally one of the reasons MIL wants them to move is because they think NYC is crime ridden, and they have moved to a red state. Really doesn't take much to connect those dots....", "And that they live in a red state. Been living for 50 years, all my life. There's crime everywhere. I love my city.", "Use this as practice in tuning people out. It sounds like from your post, you\u2019re going to need a lot of it."]}
