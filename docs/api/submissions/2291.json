My grandfather lived with us, so he moved there with them, his other child\u2019s family just wasn\u2019t set up for him to move in with them. My parents offered that I could move there with them, but I declined, since I would have known no one there - it was basically a retirement community made up of modest single family homes - and had a good network where I was, but also because it was kind of in the middle of nowhere. I honestly think that one of the things that significantly contributed to my father\u2019s rapid decline in health - he died less than 6 years after the move, while having been in pretty good health doing a job that required a good amount of physical activities - was becoming isolated, he went from taking the subway every day, walking through the city, stopping in book stores and the like, to sitting around on the couch, watching tv, and pretty much doing nothing else.

When they moved, they moved away from my partner\u2019s grandmother who was at that time in an assisted living facility.

I think it\u2019s because the daughter just doesn\u2019t wanna spend time with the mother-in-law which is her right. But the fact that she specifically said red state is concerning. Are you saying that there\u2019s no blue people that live there meaning Democrats? Why is everything political anymore she never said that the mother-in-law even talked about politics so where is that coming from. I guess it\u2019s the way young people train their kids if someone disagrees with you attack them. If someone doesn\u2019t think like you do stay away from them. I think she\u2019s just using that as an excuse to not go visit the mother-in-law which is really terrible. I get the fact that she wants to be near her family and her husband\u2018s OK with that so there\u2019s nothing wrong there it\u2019s probably best she stay where she\u2019s At.

The only thing I would suggest is to calmly and politely tell the grandparents that if they wanna come up and see her that\u2019s fine just no politics. But she seems dead set on excluding them from their lives. But I guess if the Husband is OK with that then they just need to tell the grandmother that they\u2019re gonna be cut off and no longer wanna speak to them.

She didn't mention it beyond that.\n\nI think the reason she brought it up at all is because she wants to set down roots wherever she raises her daughter. She's envisioning at least 18 years there.

To not come to Christmas dinner? To not send tacky matching outfits for the baby? To not babysit once a month while living hundred of miles away?\" Because it's not like the son and DIL can just... screen their calls and avoid her. Or block her on social media. Or enforce a strict information diet. Or not open their door when she shows up unannounced. Like, you're only hurting yourself there, grandma. You trap more flies with honey.", "Aw thanks! I'm a huge fan of the phrase \"assert your dominance\" when applied to not accepting crappy treatment. I think OP and her husband really need to run with this. If his mother wants to go for public shaming, do it right back and nip this behavior before it has a chance to take hold with the kid. Also... OP's husband needs to take the firm stand here. Letting your pregnant wife bear the brunt of your mother's public tantrum is not cool.", "Yep, I\u2019ve been enjoying all the road work and improvements to the area my taxes are paying for, while listening to people bitch about high taxes that they don\u2019t \u201cget nothing for\u201d they fail to look around and see. Or they\u2019ve never left their little area and don\u2019t realize how bad public infrastructure is in states  with lower taxes.", "On a serious note, those are both excellent analogies.\n\nOn a semi-serious note, u/StreamOfTyrosine I think we've found our holiday card design."]}
