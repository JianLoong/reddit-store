A house in their neighborhood is up for sale. His parents said as a Christmas gift this year they are giving us the money for the down payment on the house so we can in his moms words \u201c move out of our horrible state and little apt.\u201d \n\nWe both didn\u2019t know what to say w have never had any plans to move or of state never implied it was something we would ever consider. My entire family including my parents and everyone I have even known is here,our jobs are here and I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not moving my daughter to a deep red state just not happening. \n\nWe told her on the call thanks and we appreciate the offer but we have no intentions on moving and love it here even in our tiny apt. \n\nShe hung up and it has become a thing. She is blasting us on Facebook for being ungrateful and raising our daughter in a crime ridden city ( it\u2019s not) \n\nAll her friends are backing her up in the comments about how I\u2019ll be a terrible mother and she is offering us a house and home for our baby. She thinks that because her offer is so generous we are assholes to decline. \n\nAll this is making me feel guilty as hell.

In the same *neighbourhood* you say.  Might as well be next door.  Her offer is selfish and her tactics amount to emotional blackmail.", "Her assumption that she can just move you out says a lot but the fact that she is blasting you on social media for not doing what she wants tells you everything you need to know. You have nothing to feel guilty about. She thinks because she wants to see your child she has the right to demand you uproot to where she decided to move to. And castigaate you when you refuse. How to build a great relationship with your new grandchild - not. NTA", "NTA\n\nFirst of all and most important, your husband has your back.

This offer was about control on their part", "NTA - And be GLAD she's that far away.", "NTA If you move there they will make your lives hell. You will never have privacy or one on one time with your child because they will always be there.", "NTA, mom in law is your classic narcissist.

That's not a gift. That's a bribe. She's buying her presence in your daughter's child. Seeing the way she's behaving you should be glad you refused and got to know her true colours. Imagine having her around your daughter. Don't stress out. Focus on your health and peace. NTA.", "NTA, especially when you are in a better State. She should not be pushy and is wrong for even stressing you during this time. Hopefully you have the support of your husband and he needs to step in and ask her to stop acting this way.", "Dont feel guilty OP that is exactly what the inlaws want you to feel. Your whole live is up there and its a big ask to make you up root your whole life to move down there. If they want to see there grandbaby they are going have to make the effort to see them thereselves. \n\nYou live where is best for you not them. And Im proud of you for not caving to them.

She's throwing a public tantrum because you're not obeying her, and that shows you exactly why you should never, ever live close to her.

So they can see their grandbaby a couple of times a week/month? Nope nope nope. That's very controlling.", "NTA, you don't have to accept a gift that makes you move if you do not want to move.\n\nYour husband needs to stand up to his mother and tell her that its not your fault they moved and the fact that she is blasting y'all on facebook makes her act like shes a teenager.\n\nI would of commented \"So you moved, found another house there but we don't want to move and now we are the bad guys?

You have enough to worry about. \n\nDid you husband tell her to stop though? Or is \"ignore it\" his solution for not having to deal with his mother and stick up for you and himself?", "NTA. My partner's parents helped us a lot when we bought. In the months following the offer, I had some very hard and honest conversations with my partner about conditions on accepting it. They couldn't have an opinion on anything, they couldn't have a key, they couldn't make a single decision regarding price or location. This was all agreed and accepted before a penny entered our account. It's been 18 months and they kept their word. \n\nIn your case, the money is being offered on the CONDITION that you move. That is not a gift that's a threat.", "Nta- your husband needs to speak to his mother and make it clear it\u2019s a joint decision not to move and that if his mother wants a relationship with him and his child, she needs to stop publicly insulting his wife. Good luck op!", "NTA\n\nwho the hell does she think she is to dictate where you live....to demand you uproot your whole lives for her amusement and control. \n\nCan you even imagine expecting that of someone...to move their life because you click your fingers? \n\nShe is rediculis...laugh at her, there is nothing else to do.\n\nYou and your hubby sounds like a great team who communicate well and share values...that is the bedt first step of being a great family unit. the fact that you are worried about being a good parent, means you will be a good parent as you will consider your child's best interest through out their lives xx", "NTA - It was not a generous gift. A gift should not come with stipulations. It was a bribe to try to get you to move closer and you said \u201cNo.\u201d She needs to respect your decision. \n\nJust going to put this out there because when I was going through it I didn\u2019t realize how much my thoughts can be tied to emotions. You\u2019re probably having a harder time with ignoring her because you are pregnant and your hormones are wacky so this drama is throwing your brain in a loop. Maybe see if husband can help you with some breathing relaxation exercises or try focusing on schools in your area that kiddo will eventually go to to ease your mind that you did the right thing. And sleep, you are growing a human and it\u2019s stressful enough without worrying about MIL several states away. \n\nIf MIL was truly generous she would have offered a down payment on a home in your choice location. Don\u2019t fall for her guilt tricks.", "NTA. Control issues much?", "NTA They were not making you a gift. They were paying you to move closer to them. Don\u2019t feel guilty about declining.", "NTA. My mom thinks Everybody Loves Raymond is a comedy, all the kids think it's a horror show. \n\nYou and your husband are adults who get to pick where you want to live. The last thing you want to do is move closer to someone who's incapable of hearing the word No and launches into a harassment campaign when you do something reasonable like not uproot your family at her say so.\n\nSee a couples and individual  therapist, you are both going to need a lot of help maintaining health boundaries with your husband's family.", "NTA. It's very sad for them that they're far away from their grandchild, but expecting you to uproot your whole lives on a whim is ridiculous. You know that.", "NTA\n\nGifts with strings aren't \"generous\".  MIL's gift can only be used to purchase a particular house in a particular area where you and your husband don't want to live.", "NTA\n\nStay strong and dont feel guilty. Yes what they\u2019re offering is very generous and nice but they\u2019re doing it for themselvs not for some selfless reasons. Dont move to a place you don\u2019t want to, especially when you\u2019re about to have a hectic life with a new baby. Stress can cause resentment and will put a strain in your and your husbands family.\n\nGood luck with the baby birthing :)", "NTA. Your MIL is doing whats in her best interest you and the baby be damned.", "NTA - I mean if she\u2019s so eager to gift you a down payment to get you out of your apartment, why not gift it to you where the choice of residence is yours not hers? \n\nThat said, I see you\u2019re in NYC? Just a word of warning that dealing with the DOE is a nightmare, so you may want to think about moving anyway once your kid gets to be school aged.", "NTA Your mil is trying to insert her dominance in the family order.  Time for your dh to contact his mother and talk to her about her responses to saying no to her generous offer.  let her know her continued ungracious replies and getting her friends to pass judgement on a private matter between you both is incredibly inappropriate.  That if she continues without abating her behaviour then you both will be left with no choice but to go LO with her, until she can calm herself down.", "NTA\n\nYour parents-in-law are out of line, and although english isn't my first language, employing social media and an bringing an extended group of people who are not related to the topic sounds very much like early stages of gaslighting to me. \n\nJust imagine what would happen if you're actually moving, and then there's a dispute down the line about how you raise your kid. Dodge those bullets as best as you can! \n\nAlso: \n\n>*My husband says to ignore her*\n\nHe has to make a stand here. If it's only you doing the current communication, and your husband pretends to be switzerland, your in-laws will see this as a sign of silent agreement with them.", "Please get off Facebook if it causes you this much distress. She's not buying your child a home, she's offering a down payment, which is not buying a home. \n\nOf course you're not leaving your entire support system and your jobs to live in a house picked out by an inlaw that you will have to pay 80% of or more in a location you want nothing to do with.
