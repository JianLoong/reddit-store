It comes from a Latin word that means, \u201ctail\u201d. That seems like a really unfortunate meaning to have for a child\u2019s name, & it guarantees a reason for musically inclined mean kids to tease her.", "NTA, and I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm sure it's been very hard on you and your husband.\n\nHave you tried telling your husband that it's not fair to your daughter to name her after her late brother?  If her name is so close to his, she's going to feel his loss like a shadow over her childhood.  Your daughter deserves to feel like her own person, not someone who needs to live up to a lost sibling, and not someone whose existence reminds her parents of the worst thing that ever happened to them.  Keep Dakota's memory alive by telling your daughter about him when she's ready.  I hope your husband comes around.", "NTA\n\n>  I completely shut it down finally and said no, that is strange, and if you feel so strongly on that maybe we should go back to therapy over this.\n\nNo maybe about it, your husband needs some more grief counselling.\n\nYou do not name a child after a child that died.   That's telling that child that they are a replacement for the child that died.   No one should be saddled with that.", "NTA. You are not disregarding his part in the planning process. He told you he wants the name. You told him no, and why. Baby names should be based off of the \"two 'yeses' and one 'no'\" rule.\n\n>and that he put a lot of thought into it and it sounded right.\n\nJust because it \"sounded right\" to *him* doesn't mean it sounds right to *you*. Did he tell you what, exactly, the \"a lot of thought\" was? Why is he so dead set on that name, other than that it \"sounded right\"?", "Nta. Back to therapy right now. The baby deserves her own special name.", "NTA. Your baby girl is not a substitute baby, it's her own person, she shouldn't have to live her whole life as a memento to her brother.", "NTA.   Naming a child should be a mutual decision.   He suggested \"Coda\" and you said no.   No problem so far.  The problem is your husband won't take no for an answer.  It is past time for him to move on and work with you to find another mutually agreeable name.  There are literally thousands of names to choose from.   Your husband needs to lose his fixation on Coda.", "This is absolutely a conversation to have with your therapist as a couple. Not here. No one is an asshole here.

I also understand how he could find meaning in the name.\n\nYou may find better understanding from your husband if you explain you are not comfortable with the name rather than that you think his perspective is strange.", "NTA\u2026 choose a name you both agree on. You do not need to name your daughter after your son who has passed to remind you of him, he will be with you always and close to your heart no matter what. \nYou\u2019re daughter deserves her own name.

At the same time, a baby is abandoned and brought to the hospital where the couple is with their other babies. They decide to adopt the baby. They initially named the baby the same as they had picked out for the baby that died. Their doctor gives them some great advice and tells them to give him his own name, he deserves to have his own name and be his own person, not tied to the memory of their baby that died. Same applies here. I can see that name being an incredibly painful DAILY reminder. I can understand where he is coming from, but your feelings are just as important as his. You both should love the name you pick. NAH.", "NAH this is so so hard and being this late in the pregnancy is probably bringing up a ton of anxiety for both of you. You should for sure be back in therapy together and individually. Wishing you and your family the best OP.", "NAH\n\nBut you need to stop saying strange and be honest that you are uncomfortable with the name and that you cannot see naming your daughter after your son. She'll always feel like she's a replacement once she hears son's name and that's not going to be a healthy shadow to grow up under. \n\nNaming kids is a two yes one no. You need to straight up say no if you are certain you don't want coda as the name. And maybe he needs to be told what coda means in its root form. And no, he does not get to play the card of he cannot accept another name. That's not how that works.\n\nWhat he's doing isn't ahole behavior, but it is extremely unhealthy and he needs to see a counselor.", "A friend of mine was given the *exact* same name as her older sister who died as an infant. She changed it the second she turned 18.\n\nNAH though, naming children is difficult under typical circumstances, your situation adds a whole extra level, and both parents have to agree on whatever name is chosen. If you feel more therapy is appropriate then go for it.\n\nI am sorry for your loss.\n\nEdit. Would suggesting similar names help? Cordelia has a similar sound.", "NAH. You need two yeses. Being passionate about it is part of this process", "I'm inclined to say NAH. Your husband is still grieving the loss of your son, it seems. His grief is probably shutting him off from communicating reasonably about it. You're also correct that your daughter should have her own identity. I'm the dad of three boys. I can't imagine your suffering. My condolences.", "NTA. This is a joint decision. You both have a veto.", "NAH.\n\nYou're right that this seems like a deeper issue than just the name. Not a therapist but worth a conversation with one, as this will probably be difficult for you both in more than the 'usual' baby experience.\n\nI'd just suggest being really gentle with each other as you navigate this.", "Names are two yeses! \n\nOne no votes it off the list", "Hard to say, but I would go with NTA. He did put in a lot of thought, but we also don't know how your daughter would react to being named after her late brother. While it is nice to try to do something in memory of a lost loved one, maybe not something so blatant as a first name?\n\nWould it possible to have Coda as the middle name instead? Also, you don't need this kind of stress while you're pregnant. It's not healthy for you or the baby. Maybe seeing a therapist is the correct call here even if it is unneeded just to help reduce stress placed on you.", "ESH for not pointing out that Dakota is also a girls name.\nAnd also a state. Two of them, even!\n\n\nCoda is a bears name.\nWhy not compromise and call your daughter Kansas or Idaho or something. There are a whole bunch of states that could be names. Or use some aspect of your sons name that isn\u2019t as plainly derivative. Danielle starts with a D, just like Dakota, as an example. \n\nSorry I\u2019m just trying to come up with ideas and not verdicts\u2026.\n\nSo verdict: Your husband should have been more open to compromise.\nIf he\u2019s just being defensive (which he is) that\u2019s just childish, but he\u2019s also a grieving father trying to connect his love for his son with his love for the child who\u2019ll keep living, so I\u2019m sympathetic.\n\nYou didn\u2019t need to brush off the idea so quickly either. Your wording may not have been harsh but what you were saying hurt your husbands feelings. His idea is a little cheesy but it\u2019s not THAT odd. Few would know, and those who did wouldn\u2019t bat a lash.\n\nApologize for hurting his feelings and see if you can work out another way to give your son a tribute, daughters name or otherwise, because of how YOU feel about it, and not how odd or common the practise is.\n\nIf he still won\u2019t budge then he\u2019s the only arsehole and I\u2019ll change my verdict.", "NAH. I personally like the idea, as it's kinda similar, but just different enough. However, I do understand why you would not be ok with it. I recommend couples therapy to get you and your husband on the same page and work through your feelings, as this is much deeper than just a disagreemnent about names.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
