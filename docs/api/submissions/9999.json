Maybe borrow from the same theme- you can even plug it in on nameBerry and go from there. Or maybe use  Coda as the middle name. The good news is there\u2019s lots of ways to honor the feeling if he\u2019s willing to open his mind and compromise.", "What about using it as a middle name? Not to be used on a daily basis but will give your husband the tribute to your son that he's looking for.", "NAH,\n\nI understand both sides. I think if you sat down and asked him why he is so set on this name and then showed to him you understand his side but then calmly explained how that effects you, maybe both of you could come to an understanding.", "This reminds me of an OP whose friend wanted to name her daughter Clamydia!", "NTA. My parents lost three babies before they had me. Only one made it long enough to get a birth certificate. Her name was Courtney.\n\nIf they had named me after her in any way like I\u2019m her resurrected ghost I think it would have fucked with my head.\n\nYour child deserved to be their own individual and not treated like a reincarnation to manage a parent\u2019s grief. \n\nMy mom still to this day visits Courtney\u2019s grave once every year on the day she was born and died to put flowers there. \n\nMy parents gave me my own completely different name. They didn\u2019t do everything perfectly but they didn\u2019t bitch that one.", "Is it that your husband is seeking a daily, happy reminder of your first child together? Help him find another way, NTA", "NAH If there weren't a death in the mix, I would say NTA since it is so obvious that you shouldn't be required to accept a name you don't like for any reason. But there is a death in the mix, so I can't call your husband TA - he's processing his grief in a way that's causing issues. Time to seek professional help.", "NAH. I lost my first daughter at birth and my partner wanted to name our second after her in a similar way or give her first name as our second childs middle name. I really understood where he was coming from because it wasn't just me that lost a child. He didn't understand how much distress us naming our second or any of our children after was causing me and how it would effect me and not to mention how I thought it would effect our children. We went back to therapy because we needed that person to help mediate us and it did help. He still wishes every now then but it helped because we were able to see each others point of and how it could effect our children in the long run once they figure out their name and if they might be uncomfortable with it themselves. Losing a child is so hard and especially when you want to try and keep their memory going sometimes it gets in the way of other things like relationships and communication. I really wish the best for you and your husband and you two find the perfect name for your daughter.", "I hear Coda all I can think about is that bear from the Disney movie and the large amount of dogs with that name.", "NTA, if you use it the kid is going to have a whole complex that she only exists to replace another person. Coda is literally derived from Dakota.", "NAH with the context, it sounds like your husband is still grieving. But, being named after a sibling that has passed can be too much to put on a kid. Your daughter is going to be her own person and having the same first name will more likely then not just have y\u2019all comparing her life to what could have been.", "NTA. Even if there weren't a lot of different uses of 'coda' (musical term, child of deaf adults, codependents anonymous, etc), it wouldn't be right to name a child after a deceased sibling. You may tell them about their sibling when they're old enough, and you don't want them finding out that that's where their name came from. You'd be setting them up to be in the sibling's shadow their whole life, and at the end of the day, you don't even like the name. I would recommend grief counseling, though.", "NTA.\n\nHis thinking it's a good idea that may help him doesn't overcome the fact that a similar name will likely bring you pain and attach a legacy to your daughter that actually has nothing to do with her. She is not a \"replacement\" for your dearly departed baby boy.\n\nI'm sorry, OP, that is a tough one to sort out.", "NTA and it is really annoying that clearly that is something that would trigger you and you are uncomfortable with yet he is so set on it. Him choosing a name that sounds like of similar should not trump the important of choosing a name that doesn't cause negative emotions.", "NTA. This is one of those things things that is two yeses and one no. You don't get to stomp your feet and demand something. It's very selfish to do so.", "NTA.  Baby naming is a Two Yes, One No situation.  Keep going, but definitely get you both into therapy.  This is going to be a traumatic time for both of you and you need the support.  Wishing you both the best! <3", "NTA.  I\u2019m sorry for your loss, but your family has to move forward and putting your daughter in her brother\u2019s shadow for life isn\u2019t right for anyone.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not saying to forget your son, but there has to be another way of honoring him that works for your family.", "NTA it\u2019s way too close. That would hurt me every time I said it. Like I\u2019m trying to take a piece of my first born and burden my second born. Would not sit right with me either. She deserves her own name.", "My sister's name is my dead sister's middle name. Thankfully my mother knows that she's not a replacement and doesn't treat her any different than anyone else (except she's overprotective because my sister is the baby of the family)", "FWIW - Obviously, the circumstances are no where near as tragic and I\u2019m very sorry for your loss, but my father hated being a junior.  Your daughter deserves her own name, it is the first gift you\u2019ll ever give her.", "Plus, it's usually used as a nickname for Dakota.", "Same in phonology. The coda is what comes after the nucleus, generally the end. Take the word SING, for example, lets split it in three sections, onset, nucleus, and coda. S (onset) - IN (nucleus) - G (coda).", "I\u2019ve also heard the word \u201ccoda\u201d used in reference to the final scene in a movie or miniseries, so yeah, I wouldn\u2019t want to name a kid that either.  Also, if your husband is set on naming your daughter after her brother, why not just name her Dakota?  It\u2019s can be used for a child of either gender.", "I know musically inclined people who have chosen Koda/ Coda as a name for their children and see beauty in the meaning, their kids see the end of lots of generational traumas and will get to start fresh! I don\u2019t think the origin of the name is relevant to OP\u2019s situation", "its a nickname for Dakota, showing the husband still has major issues.", "coda is short for dakota bc if you shorten dakota its kota aka coda.", "Not to mention it is used for codependents anonymous groups \u2026", "My first thought was that it sounded like a dog name", "I walked a (male) dog named Coda in high school.  Not a suitable name for a girl.\n\nNTA, and it sounds like your husband needs grief counseling.\n\nThis might sound paranoid, but make sure your husband can't go off and register the birth while you are recovering or he might name your daughter despite your wishes.", "Lovely. And thanks indeed for sharing.", "Who tf is going to know that", "That is not true lmao", "Coda doesn't mean anything in Spanish except the musical term. Definitely nothing rude.", "Thank you, that makes sense. I'm probably thinking of the movie. I have only heard about it, so I wasn't sure, but I thought of those things instantly. I also now recall it's the name of the little bear in Brother Bear.", "My dog\u2019s name is Takoda but my mom and sibling call her Koda for short", "People who are familiar with substance abuse / addiction recovery programs. It\u2019s the first thing I thought of.", "The tens of millions of people who are involved with 12-step programs? It's the first thing I thought of.", "Cola en espa\u00f1ol\n\nIt makes me so sad that I can kind of read Portuguese but Italian is completely alien to me.", "Frank.\n\n.....Candida.", "My grandmother's name is Melena."]}
