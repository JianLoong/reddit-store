They initially named the baby the same as they had picked out for the baby that died. Their doctor gives them some great advice and tells them to give him his own name, he deserves to have his own name and be his own person, not tied to the memory of their baby that died.

You need to straight up say no if you are certain you don't want coda as the name. And maybe he needs to be told what coda means in its root form.

Your wording may not have been harsh but what you were saying hurt your husbands feelings. His idea is a little cheesy but it\u2019s not THAT odd.

I personally like the idea, as it's kinda similar, but just different enough. However, I do understand why you would not be ok with it.
