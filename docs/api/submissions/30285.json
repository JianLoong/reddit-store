But:\n\n1) don\u2019t let your grief over your mom\u2019s passing and this woman\u2019s and your father\u2019s disrespect keep you up crying at night. Your mom would want you to be strong, to be ok and get the beat grades you can so you have choices in life about what do do next, including how much contact you want with your dad. At 17, you\u2019re nearly at the point of being able to make freer choices. \n\n2) when you can\u2019t change circumstances and it\u2019s not easy to leave them, accept that they exist and stop fighting (I know that is harder than it sounds). Your dad sounds too selfish to change, so don\u2019t waste energy trying to get him to grow more morals or to stop bringing his affair partner round. Focus on you - ignore or suffer the presence of the woman - be businesslike and calm and keep out of the way if you can. Your mom wouldn\u2019t want you to burn on the same altar of pain that she did. Channel your anger and grief into doing what you need to do. Set out a plan for how you get through, day-by-day, until you can leave. Eat, study, see friends, sleep, wash, repeat\u2026\n\n3) find outside support from friends, family and even school. Your teachers may have noticed something is up. If you can talk to a counsellor, maybe they can talk to your dad or at least let you know what resources are available to you. If your dad is threatening that he might not want anything to do with you, alert family, friends or school in case things escalate. Make sure you have key documents, put away money if you can and check out information on scholarships to college, jobs, etc. \n\n4) if you don\u2019t want the bribes, don\u2019t take them.

To keep the peace, just don\u2019t go out of your way to be rude or to prevent them meeting. \n\n5) Your dad is clearly choosing this woman over you. Remember that that is not about you, it is about him having the same (possibly narcissistic) traits that led him to cheat on your mom.

So he's around sometimes.\n\n\nIf yours is anything like mine (cheaters, amirite), here's a rough outline of what's to come:\n\nHe'll realize he was wrong and it will more than likely be too late. It will be after he's said the worst things a child can hear from a parent, after your scars heal.\n\nYou'll have hated him, pretended to have forgotten him, tried to forgive him, and begun to start working on yourself before he apologizes.\n\nExpect this. Based on his narcissistic responses, I encourage you to seek out a therapist and start your own important work as soon as possible.", "OP NTA and never AH. I\u2019m so sorry. As someone who had their bio father choose his \u201cnew \u201c family over me, my dms are always open.", "NTA but here's what you need to do - you need to ignore your dad and his sidepiece, and you need to concentrate on those grades. It can't help you right now but those grades are going to get you into higher education and away from his gaslighting and manipulation. Education is your way out of there and if you do well enough you can decide to never go back. It will be hard, but he's made his bed and he's too self-absorbed to see (or care) how he's hurting you. \n\nGet good grades. Get out. Go no contact. Live a good life, like your mum would've wanted, away from your failure of a father.", "NTA. It sounds like your dad is one of the worst kinds of parents around who constantly puts himself before his children. Sorry for your loss, OP. You aren\u2019t wrong.

I'm so sorry for your loss, you don't deserve this. He should he behaving like an adult not a petulant child. He may be grieving but so are you. You've just lost your mother and you need your dad to step up and be there for you and instead he's more concerned about having it off with the lady he cheated on your dying mother with. Goddamn.

Please take what you can from him, the gifts and whatnot without sharing anything of personal value, it will be used against you. Rather you should rely on older family members like aunts and grandparents if you have them.\n\nI'm deeply sorry and can't imagine the sorrow you must feel right now. But I want you to know that you are not alone and people do care about you. I've lost a child and if you want to speak to an adult woman bursting with motherly feelings then feel free to message me. I don't want to be weird and message you first, I'm not a creep, just highly empathic and my heart is breaking for you.", "NTA. It is very sad your mother is gone, but that does not wash away the stain of your father's adultery. That woman to you will likely always be The Mistress, and frankly the fact your father can't see that the odds of you accepting the woman he cheated on your late mother with are slim to none, is disgusting self-centeredness at it's finest.  \nUnfortunately, it seems like the man cares more about dipping his wick than being even a half-decent father to you. I hope you have actual supportive adults in your life.", ">update: I talked to him about how i felt. he told me that i\u2019m trying to take him away from his happiness, and he told me that if i keep trying to \u201ccontrol him\u201d ( i told him how i felt , not what he has to do because it\u2019s not my place ) he doesn\u2019t want a relationship with me\n\nOP your father is such a huge asshole.\n\nPlease don't let his shitty behavior deter you from getting help from other adults in your life \n\nWhat he wants isn't happiness, But the ability to indiscriminately do whatever awful thing he wants to do. Don't let him bully you into being his emotional punching bag now that your mother is gone. \n\nIt's not uncommon for abusers to turn their shitty behavior on to their children after their spouse dies. \n\nNothing he's doing is about \"grief\". He was doing awful things before your mother passed and he's going to keep doing awful things after.\n\nTalking to him is going to be pointless. Please reach out to a counselor in your school or an extended family member (preferably someone on your mother's side who's less likely to take his side and just blame it on 'grief').\n\nSome people are just... Not good people. And sometimes those not good people are even our parents. I'm sorry you had to experience this.", "First of all, I am very sorry for your loss.\n\nOP, your dad made his decision and I'm sorry he's not choosing you. They are both trash people and you have every right to feel sad, angry and disappointed with your father. He chose to cheat when you and your mom needed him most. He chose his AP over you again over just now.\n\n I don't think you can make him see things from your point of view. He is way too selfish to accept them being wrong. He wants you to be nice because he can soothe whatever guilt/shame he feels by making you pretend you're ok with the situation.\n\nBut you're not ok. And you're more than justified in your feelings.\n\nI think you should reach out to someone to help you get out of this situation. Family member, a teacher or a school counsellor, maybe? Maybe one of your friend's parents that you feel comfortable talking about it with?\n\nYou shouldn't have to carry this burden alone. Please, ask for help.\n\nLast thing I want to touch on is this - once you get help from one of the adults in your life, consult with a lawyer regarding inheritance after your mom. I wouldn't trust your father not to cheat you out of the inheritance or straight up lie to you about it.

Your feelings are valid, and it's important to acknowledge the complexity of emotions that come with grief and betrayal.\n\n  \nYou are NTA for feeling this way. The loss of your mother is still very fresh, and it's natural to feel a sense of loyalty to her memory, as well as hurt due to your father's actions. It's clear that this situation is causing you a great deal of distress, impacting your sleep and your studies, which are crucial at your stage in life.\n\n  \nWhile it's true that friends can be replaced and family cannot, this does not mean you are obligated to accept or condone behaviour that causes you pain. Family relationships are important, but they should also be respectful and considerate of each member's feelings, especially in times of grief.\n\n  \nMaintaining distance for your own emotional well-being is not only necessary but wise. It's important to set boundaries for yourself, and if your father's behaviour is causing you distress, it's okay to seek space from that situation. You've been dealt a very challenging hand, and how you choose to handle it, including seeking distance from your father, is your choice and a valid one at that.\n\n  \nIt's concerning that your father is not acknowledging your feelings and is instead suggesting that your discomfort is an attempt to control him. This is not about control; it's about your emotional health and the need for a supportive environment, especially during such a vulnerable time in your life.\n\n  \nYou might benefit from speaking to a counsellor or therapist who can provide you with support and strategies to cope with these complex family dynamics. They can also help you communicate your needs to your father in a way that might be better received.

Work, earn, save, go to school, stay humble, learn constantly, and put your energy into building a good life for yourself. If your dad wants to bribe you, take his bribes in the form of assets and investments in your future. Let him pay for school, transportation, a sturdy computer etc. Focus focus focus on your progress so that this hurt and resentment will no longer take up the biggest space in your life; it will shrink away as other good things grow and fill your heart and sense of self.\n\nAlong the way you'll make friends and learn lessons. Enjoy everyone but don't allow yourself to become distracted.\n\nUse birth control.\n\nIf you have siblings, lean on them through this time.\n\nIn another 17 years you'll look back and be proud of the life you carved out for yourself.
