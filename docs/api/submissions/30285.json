Maternal/paternal anyone? If they don't. Don't go anywhere. Stay in the house study, and learn life skills. I recommend \"Adult children of emotionally immature parents. \" .

But:\n\n1) don\u2019t let your grief over your mom\u2019s passing and this woman\u2019s and your father\u2019s disrespect keep you up crying at night. Your mom would want you to be strong, to be ok and get the beat grades you can so you have choices in life about what do do next, including how much contact you want with your dad. At 17, you\u2019re nearly at the point of being able to make freer choices. \n\n2) when you can\u2019t change circumstances and it\u2019s not easy to leave them, accept that they exist and stop fighting (I know that is harder than it sounds). Your dad sounds too selfish to change, so don\u2019t waste energy trying to get him to grow more morals or to stop bringing his affair partner round. Focus on you - ignore or suffer the presence of the woman - be businesslike and calm and keep out of the way if you can. Your mom wouldn\u2019t want you to burn on the same altar of pain that she did. Channel your anger and grief into doing what you need to do. Set out a plan for how you get through, day-by-day, until you can leave. Eat, study, see friends, sleep, wash, repeat\u2026\n\n3) find outside support from friends, family and even school. Your teachers may have noticed something is up. If you can talk to a counsellor, maybe they can talk to your dad or at least let you know what resources are available to you. If your dad is threatening that he might not want anything to do with you, alert family, friends or school in case things escalate. Make sure you have key documents, put away money if you can and check out information on scholarships to college, jobs, etc. \n\n4) if you don\u2019t want the bribes, don\u2019t take them.

To keep the peace, just don\u2019t go out of your way to be rude or to prevent them meeting. \n\n5) Your dad is clearly choosing this woman over you.

So he's around sometimes.\n\n\nIf yours is anything like mine (cheaters, amirite), here's a rough outline of what's to come:\n\nHe'll realize he was wrong and it will more than likely be too late. It will be after he's said the worst things a child can hear from a parent, after your scars heal.\n\nYou'll have hated him, pretended to have forgotten him, tried to forgive him, and begun to start working on yourself before he apologizes.\n\nExpect this. Based on his narcissistic responses, I encourage you to seek out a therapist and start your own important work as soon as possible.", "OP NTA and never AH. I\u2019m so sorry.

It will be hard, but he's made his bed and he's too self-absorbed to see (or care) how he's hurting you. \n\nGet good grades. Get out. Go no contact.

Family relationships are important, but they should also be respectful and considerate of each member's feelings, especially in times of grief.\n\n  \nMaintaining distance for your own emotional well-being is not only necessary but wise. It's important to set boundaries for yourself, and if your father's behaviour is causing you distress, it's okay to seek space from that situation.

Figure out your finances so that you can attend without depending on him.\n\nKEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN. So long as he is not being \"actively\" abusive, just keep quiet and get those grades, Between work and studying elsewhere(library, friend's house) stay away from him.\n\nIf you don't plan on attending college, make sure you have a workable plan for when you graduate/turn 18.  Stay smart, stay safe.  If you take things from him(to be nice) go for cash or liquidable assets(is a Vanity something you can sell or need to take with you when you leave home).", "NTA, but it seems like talking about with him it isn't going to be productive right now. If you can, make an appointment with a therapist or school counselor so you have a safe adult to talk with about this on a regular basis.\n\nYes, your dad's being manipulative and it sounds like he's attempting to check out of parenting his minor child. I'm sorry you're going through this, especially so soon after losing your mom. I would make sure you're on a path that will get you away from the situation after you graduate, whether that's a job and apartment or college/dorm. That's something else a school guidance counselor can help with. If you get any allowance money, save it, either in cash your dad can't find or in an account he's not cosigned on; checking out of a relationship with you can also mean checking out financially, and it doesn't sound like your dad has a strong sense of ethics or responsibility.", "NTA. but as a fellow HS senior that just lost their mom too, i am sending you so much love and strength. i\u2019m so sorry that you have to go through this on top of all the grief. \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79", "I'm sorry, but the same way he picked her over your mom, he's going to pick her over you.\n\nYou have to plan your life around this. Are you going away to college? If you are, then focus on getting through this year. \n\nIf your father is paying for college, maintain bare minimum contact with him. If he's not, cut contact as soon as you can.\n\nBecause it's clear that he's going to force this woman into your life if you're around.\n\nI truly am sorry.

I wasn't trying to suggest she openly say that to him. Just for herself, to find peace with the situation. Part of the healing process usually requires that she try and see his perspective.", "I'm sorry to hear about all of your troubles. I hope you find a good, safe place to stay just as soon as you are able. Sometimes also friends or friends' parents can help bridge the gap while you're still in school.", "I don't know about how your money is being held, but some other folks on this thread may be able to advise you. There are stories of parents withdrawing their children's savings, especially if the accounts are held at the same bank. I would suggest going through some previous reddit threads like this to see what kinds of suggestions people have to make sure your money remains safely in your name.", "Best thing you can do. Live your own life. Leave your father behind.\n\nKeep the money safe from him. If it's in a bank account with his name, I wouldn't trust him not to steal it.\n\nWhen you move, don't give him the address. Change your phone number. Get this awful person out of your life.", "I understood you, I just disagree. That's a model of healing that centers the abuser.

It seems the comment I replied to has gone, so I can't remember what I thought was well put, but I definitely don't think any of those things are OK or 'normal'. I think OP's dad is being awful and definitely in the wrong. I don't think she should do what he asks, and I don't think she should seek to pacify him. He's clearly doing a rubbish job at the moment, but trying to change him with rage or anger is unlikely to work. My own advice in another comment is that she seek out some support from other adults in her life. I am hopeful that at some point Dad will be better, but of course that can't be guaranteed. If I unintentionally implied that I support Dad, then I apologise completely.", "I just read the update, that is sketchy. \n\nOk, that makes sense. I don't mean to the extent of empathizing, but understanding of what drives him, like the gaslighting-like attempt mentioned in the update, is important to acquiring forgiveness of self and of the situation.", "No it is not."]}
