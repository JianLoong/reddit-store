Losing a parent is incredibly hard, and I can't imagine how difficult it must be for you to also deal with the betrayal of infidelity.\n\nYou should and need to surround yourself with people who care about you and who will listen to you without judgment.\n\nGrief and betrayal are complicated emotions, and it is completely normal to feel angry, confused and hurt. Don't hesitate to lean on your support system and seek professional help if you feel it would be beneficial.\n\nRemember that you are not alone in this. Surround yourself with loved ones who can offer comfort and understanding. Sometimes talking to others who've gone through similar situations can provide valuable insights and coping strategies.\n\nWhile it may feel overwhelming, it's important to prioritise your well-being. Taking care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally can help you navigate through these difficult times. Consider engaging in activities that bring you comfort and spending time with people who uplift you. \n\nIf you're comfortable doing so, it might be helpful to express your feelings to your father about the impact the affair has had on you and your mum.

Maternal/paternal anyone? If they don't. Don't go anywhere. Stay in the house study, and learn life skills. I recommend \"Adult children of emotionally immature parents. \" .

He may be choosing to hide in another relationship but he will be scared right now and I\u2019m sure that inside, he\u2019s just as much as a mess as you are. You will never fully understand your Mum and Dad\u2019s relationship and believe me on this point - turning yourself into some kind of agent of vengeance on her behalf will only damage YOU. I\u2019m talking from experience here. \n\nA forgiving path will help to heal both you eventually. Forgive him if his flaws, just as you should forgive yourself for yours.

But:\n\n1) don\u2019t let your grief over your mom\u2019s passing and this woman\u2019s and your father\u2019s disrespect keep you up crying at night. Your mom would want you to be strong, to be ok and get the beat grades you can so you have choices in life about what do do next, including how much contact you want with your dad. At 17, you\u2019re nearly at the point of being able to make freer choices. \n\n2) when you can\u2019t change circumstances and it\u2019s not easy to leave them, accept that they exist and stop fighting (I know that is harder than it sounds). Your dad sounds too selfish to change, so don\u2019t waste energy trying to get him to grow more morals or to stop bringing his affair partner round. Focus on you - ignore or suffer the presence of the woman - be businesslike and calm and keep out of the way if you can. Your mom wouldn\u2019t want you to burn on the same altar of pain that she did. Channel your anger and grief into doing what you need to do. Set out a plan for how you get through, day-by-day, until you can leave. Eat, study, see friends, sleep, wash, repeat\u2026\n\n3) find outside support from friends, family and even school. Your teachers may have noticed something is up. If you can talk to a counsellor, maybe they can talk to your dad or at least let you know what resources are available to you. If your dad is threatening that he might not want anything to do with you, alert family, friends or school in case things escalate. Make sure you have key documents, put away money if you can and check out information on scholarships to college, jobs, etc. \n\n4) if you don\u2019t want the bribes, don\u2019t take them. Don\u2019t waste energy trying to please him where this woman is concerned. To keep the peace, just don\u2019t go out of your way to be rude or to prevent them meeting. \n\n5) Your dad is clearly choosing this woman over you. Remember that that is not about you, it is about him having the same (possibly narcissistic) traits that led him to cheat on your mom.
