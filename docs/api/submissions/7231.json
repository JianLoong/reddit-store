One coworker, \u201cJohn\u201d in particular just happens to be my boss.\n\nUsually when I housesit I have control of the house, staying over night, getting mail,  taking care of the dog and cats. Johns son has never been an issue until this week. He has been coming and going non stop from the house. I never know when he\u2019s coming and when he is at the house he never leaves until I make up some excuse on why he needs to leave (I have zoom class, an exam to take, etc). One night I came to the house and he was already there watching tv sprawled out on the couch, leaving dirty dishes on the counter. This of course upset me but he left when I said I had class in fifteen minutes. \n\nJohn texted me on tuesday (by now I had been housesitting for 3 days) letting me know to tell him if his son is getting to be a bother w the coming and going that he\u2019s doing. I told him that I\u2019m trying not to mind it but that it\u2019s a little overbearing w him there every single day. john said he would text his son about not coming over. verbatim \u201cI will tell **** not to be at the house unless invited. I will be sure he understands this is coming from me. This is your house this week.\u201d \n\nAfter that text he wasn\u2019t there for a couple days until last night. My daughter and I were in our pajamas, just finished dinner, enjoying a movie when all of a sudden someone barges in through the door. I had no idea who it was as I didn\u2019t see anyone pull up. Lo and behold it\u2019s his son w a basket full of laundry. Immediately I\u2019m irritated. He looks at me and is like \u201coh hey my dryer is broken so I\u2019m just going to do some laundry\u201d. He doesn\u2019t have a job so he could have done it during the day when I\u2019m at work. Better yet, he could have texted me saying he needed to do laundry is it okay if he brings some over to do. I would have told him sure but if he could do it during the day while I\u2019m not there that would be better. But nope. He just shows up unannounced barging in with his dinner and just sits at the counter watching videos on his phone.\n\nI get my daughter and all our stuff and leave. I ended up sending him a text explaining how I felt \n\n\u201cI don't mean to offend but this needs to be said. You\u2019re a great friend. You really are. And that\u2019s all I\u2019m looking for rn. I put my relationship w John first seeing as he\u2019s my employer for both my jobs. When I housesit I\u2019m in charge of the house for those days. A simple text or heads up about coming over would be great. Housesitting for John is like a little mini vacation for ***and I, so having someone infringe on that time can be a little frustrating and a little disconcerting. Thanks for understanding\u201d\n\nAITA for being bothered by the sons actions and telling him to text me when he\u2019s going to the house?

What if Son leaves the door open and the pet runs out into the road while you're at work?", "NTA.\n\nHowever, you seem to have to set some boundaries, because this situation is rife for drama.  This is too much entangled into one thing.  You have a boss, whose house you also stay at while he is gone, and you are apparently good friends with his son, who comes and goes typically from the house. \n\nThere are too many overlapping and conflicting relationships here IMO.

Normally i'd say, not your house not your call, but it seems your boss would rather you there than his son. Though at this point you may want to ask your boss how he wants you to handle the son", "NTA\n\nYou were hired to watch the house and given the expectation of privacy. John needed to contact his son and confirm he wasn't to come over.\n\nFrankly, you could have called the cops and had him removed as a trespasser. The property owner gave you permission to be there.\n\nYou sending the son an apology text was inappropriate, imo. He was was behaving immature and rudely, not you.", "NTA...You have a right to privacy when you are house-sitting. Having a guy show up unannounced is a violation of that privacy. Personally, I would have told him this to his face on the first day.  If your boss doesn't want you to house-sit after that, that's his business, but when you ARE there you are the one managing the property.", "NTA. Especially since it's John's house, not his sons house and John told him not to be there uninvited. Honestly asking for advance text is absolutely normal. It's the bare minimum to let people know.", "NTA - OPs comments make it clear that the son is an unemployed drug addict (who may be sober) once an addict always an addict. Who is trying to hit on OP. Son was told by his dad to not come over when he is not there. The son still comes over. OP is in the right for removing herself from this situation.", "I think you should stop housesitting for John.  It\u2019s totally inappropriate for his son to come over uninvited.

Clearly the father doesn\u2019t trust the son or he would be doing the house sitting!", "NTA", "ESH, except for John\n\nHouse-sitting is a job, not a mini vacation. Your child shouldn't be there either. You shouldn't demand people to cater to your vacation feel. You are not entitled to the house just because you work there.\n\nSaid that, your employer made his boundaries clear to his son. Those boundaries were not respected, making son an asshole. He is not entitled to the house just because it belongs to his father.", "I'm leaning towards YTA\n\nIt's not your house.", "ESH. I get how it can be frustrating and unsettling for you to have someone coming in whenever but it is his father's house. It would make sense for him to not think he needs permission to go there. You should have left it up to your boss to keep him from going over there", "It's not your house. House sitting is a job. How entitled do you have to be to consider it a mini vacation!? I mean, obviously your boss has more money than you, but you don't have to act like it's your personal party house for you and your kid.

You\u2019re there to house sit, not to bitch about how uncomfortable you are that someone\u2019s son is in their house. THEIR house, not yours.", "NTA.\n\nI think John's son sees you as the maid when you're house-sitting.  If he makes a mess, you'll clean it up because you're responsible for the house while John is away, and because John is your boss, his son figures you won't say anything because you'll risk losing your jobs.  \n\nI read your other comments about the son wanting a relationship with you.  So that is another problem that needs to be addressed.  He's coming over unannounced to try to wear you down and get you to change your mind about having a relationship with him.  Also, he's doing this when your child is present.  That's kind of creepy.\n\nI think you need to have a serious discussion with John about this.  John already told his son not to come over unless invited, but that didn't work.  Something else needs to be done, and John is the one that needs to address the situation.  And if John has issues with his son having access to the house, it's time to change the locks and not give the son a key.   If the son doesn't have a key, and has to have permission to enter the house, you are then free refuse to let him in and to call the cops if he won't leave.", "I had a pet/house sitting business for 10 years. The #1 thing that would aggravate me was not being informed about people coming by or that were actually staying at the house. One client had a cleaning lady - no problem - she came once a week. Outside work? I couldn't care less.\n\nI would have drawn the line with either family/friends just dropping in to hang out. If THEY do damage, I'd be held responsible (most likely - I'm the one that was bonded/insured).\n\nThe funniest incident was a client gone for 3 weeks. He said that a painter was going to show up on a particular day and would be painting the living room and kitchen over the course of 2 days. Okay, no problem. But when I walked in the first day, the whole area had been taped and cordoned off like a kill room from Dexter. He was spray painting....which explained all the plastic, but I'd recently binge watched a season of Dexter and got the total creeps when I saw that.\n\nBut you are definitely leaving something out here. Why are you sitting if the son has full access to the house while you are there? Have you let your boss know about his son dropping in? There's a reason the son isn't doing the sitting...what is that?", "NTA. He violated his dad's directive to leave the house and you alone.
