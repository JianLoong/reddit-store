I mean why be in a relationship at all if you can't understand why she is feeling this way. Its not FOMO is knowing you don't give a rats ass about her feelings.", "It appears you or nor anyone in your family or even her own sister has any care for your girlfriend's feelings. I imagine you will spend many vacations more with your parents and your sister if your family is this exclusionary of partners. How would having a partner there over a friend change anything, you would spend as much time with each. Most people would not put up with this for long. Your parents are sending the message, you are not welcome to your girlfriend and you just rolled over and accepted it. Worse you made sure her sister could be included over your own girlfriend. You showed your girlfriend she was last in your consideration, after your parents, sister and even after her own sister. You are an absolute asshole.", "More than anything - this could be the end of your relationship. But you do you.\n\nYTA", "Spending time with your SISTER is more important to you than spending time with your GIRLFRIEND?!?!?!?   Bluntly speaking, how did you manage to get a girlfriend?", "I get your point. About the your opinion ok that comment being unhealthy.\n\nBut this is AITA. The whole point is to say whether or not you think the OP is TA or not.", "No, it's not relevant to girlfriend's feelings.\nNo matter who decides what, the fact remains that these 18+ supposedly adults decide to have a vacation that excludes girlfriend, just because OP's oppressive parents won't allow her to come.\n\nIf it were me, I'd give my parents the finger, spend my holiday money on a cheap camping trip, and enjoy that with my boyfriend. I don't understand their mindset at all.", ">I think it's completely natural that the gf would be hurt bc she's excluded from a multiple week vacation with her boyfriend and then hurt some more bc her sister gets invited. \n\nI guess I don't see why it's worse that her sister gets an invite. She's not being invited instead of her because it was never an option for her to be invited. Her feeling being left out has nothing to do with her sister. She would be left out regardless of her sister getting the invite. So wanting a discussion about whether or not to invite her sister and being upset that they didn't has nothing to do with feeling left out. If she wanted to discuss that she could have but a discussion won't actually change anything. These are the parents rules and as they are they ones presumably paying for it OP doesn't have the option to overrule them. The only \"solution\" would be for OP to decline altogether unless she could be his +1 and that would be pretty unreasonable. I personally think the rule is stupid but they have every right to enforce it. I think it's more stupid and definitely more selfish to expect your partner to forego a free family holiday because you feel left out.", "If I would post a comment under the post yes. \n\nBut you are allowed to have micro discussions that aren\u2019t 100% the topic of the post lol. \n\nI commented a comment. I\u2019m allowed to do that.", ">But this is AITA. The whole point is to say whether or not you think the OP is TA or not.\n\nThis comment doesn't say whether the OP is an asshole though. Neither do several of your other comments. So you understand that tangential conversations can occur in the comments, right?", "Bruh \u2026 just admit you wanna be banging your gfs sister", "They\u2019re not misconstruing anything. These are the words you wrote. You\u2019re trying to label your GF as petty and selfish because she\u2019s upset about this situation - as she is total valid in being upset - and instead of doing anything at all to rectify the situation, you\u2019re trying to slither away blameless. \n\nYou should have confronted your parents about the BS rule. You could have not invited your GFs sister. OR if you\u2019re going to try and nitpick - you should not have allowed your sister to use your +1 space to invite your uninvited GFs sister. You\u2019re either deliberately ignorant, or you\u2019re trying to nail the sister. \n\nESH except your GF. Looks like you\u2019re going to fuck around and find out.", "Your entire post implies that YOU invited her. If you didn\u2019t want people getting this mixed up, then you should have written your post accurately.\n\nAll you had to do was give your gf a heads up about your sister\u2019s plan and talk with her about her feelings about it\n\nYTA", "lord you must crazy to deal with in real life if this is how you are online. Gaslighting, manipulating, dismissing, excusing, narcissistic, like dude, you are in the wrong no matter how you try to twist it and manipulate us.", "No, you\u2019re adding extra words. Your original post made it clear you invited her. Perhaps put an edit there if you want to correct your poor writing", "yeah, I think the reaction on this post would be different if it was more clear that your sister wanted to bring two friends using your and her +1s. One of her friends she wanted to bring was your gf's sister and you said sure b/c you didn't have a +1, b/c fam doesn't allow anyone you're dating. NTA, but idk... maybe just try explaining it to gf a different way too.", "I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re not allowed, damn. Let\u2019s leave it here", "Semantics are the only thing for me to dispute. I\u2019m not trying to weasel out of any verdict! \n\nThe only thing I have a problem with is trying to twist my words into me saying something I\u2019m not saying. \n\nIf you think I\u2019m TA even without the semantic dispute, OK! I\u2019m not arguing against that at all, nor can I. I\u2019ll think about your argument as well as those of all the people saying I\u2019m NTA. You think I\u2019m trying to say I\u2019m NTA when what I\u2019m really trying to say is to not misconstrue what I was trying to say."]}
