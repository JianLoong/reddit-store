{"id": 27909, "submission_id": "16vox7d", "title": "AITA for not apologizing to my brother for saying \"if he doesn't change his views he will die alone\"?", "selftext": "Yesterday we had a family dinner at our parents house where my younger brother (Ted) informed us that he and his gf(Mika) of 4 years broke up. Now this was a shock to everyone cause they seem very happy together so everyone grilled him about why and he explained.\n\nSo basically they broke up because Ted quit his job 6 months ago and wouldn't take more responsibility at household chores. His reason for not contributing more than 50 percent in chores is because he is still able to contribute his share towards the overall expenses via his investment returns. Mika wanted him to take more chores as she was working full time and he was at home all day doing whatever he wants but basically playing video games and hanging out with friends.\n\nHe explained how he felt that the relationship was pretty balanced, he worked hard to achieve this stage and he should not be burdened by more work now that he doesn't have to.  At first I was a bit taken aback because I really thought they were end game after staying together for almost 4 years. Mika and I had a very good relationship we would get along really great and our parents also loved her alot. We talk more and below is how our conversation went:\n\nMe : I think it's very stupid of you to let someone like her go because of fucking chores.\n\nTed: it's not just about chores. Its about equally contributing towards your home and relationship.\n\nMe: Sometimes, you can't be equal, you have to compromise and contribute according to how much is needed and how much you can.\n\nTed: I thought people want to be on equal footing. This is what women fought for right? To be equal to men in every way?\n\nAt this point I was very irate and just said \" this is a very bad attitude and If you don't change your views you may die alone.\n\nHe just laughed and kept eating. But my mom who until this statement was on myside suddenly started saying how I should apologise for saying such a thing. I asked her why should I apologise I don't think I said anything wrong. Now I know my brother he doesn't care what I or for that matter anyone else thinks about his decision he will always do what he wants and he doesn't expect me to apologise at all. But my mom is still insisting that I apologise to him for my remark.", "created_utc": 1696025156, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vox7d/aita_for_not_apologizing_to_my_brother_for_saying/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not about financial contributions, it's about effort. And he wasn't contributing effort. Mika was working a full time job to contribute towards the common good of the household. So Ted owes a full-time job's worth of labor to the household before Mika needs to do any chores. If Ted was spending 40 hours a week managing his investments, that counts. But from your description, his investments were largely passive, and didn't require any effort from him. \n\nNTA", "NTA, obviously, your brother is spoiled and had a mother who would step in for things that were his responsibility.  Are you all not adults?\n\nI wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone who is treating it like a transaction.  Sounds like he was using his income as leverage, and she's more going to be treated better by someone else.", "NTA, I think siblings should always be honest with each other. Obviously stay conscious of sensitive issues, or if your sibling is sensitive. But that advice will only benefit him.", "Ted sucks. It\u2019s about being EQUITABLE not equal.

The person who's unemployed should be doing more chores around the house than the person who works full time. It's never 50/50 as some might think. Good job on giving your brother a reality check.", "NTA. Give your brother 5 years for reality to sink in\u2026", "NTA. \n\nWhat does Ted mean by he's \"worked hard to achieve this stage?\" Does he mean leeching off a successful partner? He sounds like one of those \"I want to retire in my 20s\" people. He's in for a rude awakening when he finds out the years keep coming and they don't stop coming...", "NTA\n\nYou probably accurately predicted his future.", "NAH for the comment as I don't think you used any inappropriate language but I disagree with your stance. If you're contributing equally financially you should be contributing equally domestically.\n\nPersonally, if my fianc\u00e9e were to be in a position to retire tomorrow but was paying half of everything I wouldn't expect her to suddenly pick up my half of the chores.\n\nEdit: Changed to NAH because I don't think he's the asshole here either.", "YTA\n\nI'm sort of surprised at NTA comments, if he has worked hard to get to this point and sacrificed and put in the effort to be able to sustain himself financially without working, then why should things change? So because he got to this point he has to be punished and do all her chores? \n\nI understand that if you're working full-time and your partner has no job and just gets to chill at home that it would be hard to take, I do get that, but again that's not his fault HE WORKED to get to this level. Everything is still equal like it was before, he just isn't getting up to go to a job for 5 days p/week 8 hours a day.\n\nI feel like you are being unfair on him, I'm surprised no-one else has had a similar view?", "NTA. Part of being in a relationship is working towards the betterment of the the partnership. Your brother seems like he got his and fuck everyone else, including his partner.\n\nWhen we had our child, I went SAHD and my wife kept working because he job provided benefits and mine didn\u2019t. We were able to do this because I paid our joint account out of inherited investments. I was paying my share, she was working to pay hers, and I took on the bulk of child and home care. I didn\u2019t say my half of the bills is paid, I\u2019m not gonna carry any extra load. Because I\u2019m in a partnership and I strive to do what is best for us collectively. Sure, I could have just played video games instead of doing house work, but that would mean less quality time together because she would have to come home and spend an evening doing things I could do while the baby naps. And as others have said, taking on a few extra tasks because you have more time, doesn\u2019t mean spending your whole day doing it. An hour here, an hour there, and it\u2019s a load off everyone\u2019s shoulders.", "NAH. moms just want their kids to get along", "NAH - We all die alone.", "YTA your brother is right. He continued to contribute equally to the relationship, both financially and chore wise. He was pulling his weight. \n\nNow if his partner had an accident or some other circumstance he could have helped temporarily but his partner was just jealous that he had free time and wanted him to do her share of the work.", "Well, I don\u2019t think you should have said it that way \u2026 you get more flies with honey than vinegar \u2026 BUT you\u2019re right so I\u2019m going with ESH", "YTA\n\n1. We're men. We know that *everyone* dies alone, and we've made our peace with that\n2. She would've left him anyway, when he started doing more chores, because she wouldn't *respect* him. All men know when we're on that slippery slope. He was already in a lose-lose situation, despite your \"feel good\" second statement this is not how *reality* works from a man's perspective in relationships. The main reason Mika was in your life and his life for 4 years is because of what attracted her to him in the first place. I'm betting it wasn't \"the way he does chores\".\n3. Your mum is wrong. You don't owe him an apology for telling him the obvious. You owe him an apology for not being able to see how he was lost *regardless of what he does* (from his position), and trying to get him to change his views.  \n\n\nYTA because privilege is invisible to the privileged. If she lost her job she could spend months years lounging around the house doing nothing and no one would say a thing, but in his case his days are numbered whether he starts doing chores or not", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He has more free time so he is able to do more but chooses not to. And \"Women respect only your provider persona\" is such an outdated statement.

If your father doesn't want to retire and chooses to work, that's a different matter but if he's working full time then I would still assume your mother takes on more around house. It's not a gender thing, it's a contribution of effort thing. My father is retired and my stepmother works part time, so he does more around the house because he has more time to, so they can enjoy their leisure time together.", "Most of them. Although there are different kinds of retirement, so it depends a bit on what your mother does.\n\nFor example, a good friend is retired, but does a lot of charity work. It's entirely reasonable for him and his spouse to count his charitable work as labor towards the common good of the household (because the household wishes to support this charity).\n\nIt would be less reasonable for someone to argue that watching daytime TV was labor towards the good of the household.\n\nIf my spouse spent all day at work, earning the household income, and I spent most of the day watching TV or playing video games or whatever, I would expect to do the daily cooking and cleaning.", "I just said that as a joke how your mother is stepping in for an apology for him when he didn't ask for one.  If you are to apologize to him without him asking for it, he's letting another woman pick up what's his responsibility again.", "Yeah that still doesn't make him successful in a relationship. You don't ever earn the right not to pull your weight in a relationship, especially when you're not the one doing the heavy lifting. \n\nAs for the investments, hopefully he has good financial planners and advisors. Investing is not a sure thing and cost of living isn't getting any cheaper. Life circumstances can change in a heartbeat. He (and it sounds like your father may want in on this) might even develop increasingly expensive taste, owe child support, want to support himself or family in education, or even have major health crises as time goes by. Nothing is guaranteed with investments.

But the top voted comment demands 40 hours of labor before she contributes domestically which is a very transactional scenario while the second most upvoted comment says that relationships should not be transactional.\n\nIt's quite fascinating watching the cognitive dissonance play out in the votes.", "Alright.\n\nWell, they probably should have had this conversation earlier in the relationship. He's been busting his ass off since 15 to retire early. Weird that it never came up that he plans to maintain the chore split.\n\nLike I said elsewhere, I wouldn't expect my fianc\u00e9e to pick up my chores if she did something like this. I guess I just fundamentally feel like ignoring the fact that he frontloaded his life with work to enjoy the rest of it without it is really entitled.", "But he was pulling his weight wasn\u2019t he? He was contributing to household bills and doing half the chores. How is he not contributing?", "Not everyone lives in Incel world.", "I said \u201csome would be nice\u201d not \u201c40 mandatory hours\u201d", "You said that. \\_mmiggs\\_ said full time job/40 hours.
