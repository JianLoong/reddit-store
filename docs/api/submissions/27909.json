Now this was a shock to everyone cause they seem very happy together so everyone grilled him about why and he explained.\n\nSo basically they broke up because Ted quit his job 6 months ago and wouldn't take more responsibility at household chores. His reason for not contributing more than 50 percent in chores is because he is still able to contribute his share towards the overall expenses via his investment returns. Mika wanted him to take more chores as she was working full time and he was at home all day doing whatever he wants but basically playing video games and hanging out with friends.\n\nHe explained how he felt that the relationship was pretty balanced, he worked hard to achieve this stage and he should not be burdened by more work now that he doesn't have to.  At first I was a bit taken aback because I really thought they were end game after staying together for almost 4 years. Mika and I had a very good relationship we would get along really great and our parents also loved her alot. We talk more and below is how our conversation went:\n\nMe : I think it's very stupid of you to let someone like her go because of fucking chores.\n\nTed: it's not just about chores. Its about equally contributing towards your home and relationship.\n\nMe: Sometimes, you can't be equal, you have to compromise and contribute according to how much is needed and how much you can.\n\nTed: I thought people want to be on equal footing. This is what women fought for right? To be equal to men in every way?\n\nAt this point I was very irate and just said \" this is a very bad attitude and If you don't change your views you may die alone.\n\nHe just laughed and kept eating. But my mom who until this statement was on myside suddenly started saying how I should apologise for saying such a thing. I asked her why should I apologise I don't think I said anything wrong. Now I know my brother he doesn't care what I or for that matter anyone else thinks about his decision he will always do what he wants and he doesn't expect me to apologise at all.

Investing is not a sure thing and cost of living isn't getting any cheaper. Life circumstances can change in a heartbeat. He (and it sounds like your father may want in on this) might even develop increasingly expensive taste, owe child support, want to support himself or family in education, or even have major health crises as time goes by.

My hubby and me split everything 50/50. \n\nIf he would sacrifice his free time or doesn't buy any fun things for a few years to build up investments that allows him to take a break from work (and i didn't do the same and keep on enjoying my free time / spending my fun money instead of saving it) i would be very proud of him, happy for him he achieved his goal and would not even think about demanding he takes over my chores. I could have done the same, but i was too lazy to sacrifice so much, so why should i profit from his extra effort i didn't do anything to help?\n\nSure, in our marriage we would do it a little different. I would most likely support him in achieving his goal by taking over his chores while he works extra hours and he would pay me back by taking over mine for the same time period as soon he can stop working. \n\nBut both solutions are fair in my opinion. Whats not fair is to expect to profit from something you didn't help building up. \n\nSo the big question for me here is, why didn't / couldn't his gf do the same? Why didn't she built up the same amount of savings/investments as your brother? Does she earn much less or did she just choose to spend the money? If she earns the same and just spends more, then they haven't been financially compatible anyway. \n\nEither way, i don't think your brother will end up alone. Ppl who are able to build up investments while still young are seen as very stable and responsible partners and he will have no problem finding another partner. Oc you don't have to apologize, i think as soon your brother is in the mood to date again and shows up with a new gf you are prooven wrong anyway, if he dies alone you are prooven right - but since he doesn't care anyway (good for him for living his life how he wants and not be bothered by other ppls opinions), why make a big deal about it?", "I\u2019ve never understood forcing someone to apologize.

Dude is literally paying his share and doing 50% but for some reason he still has to do more.... why?", "NTA, but the rest of my post is going to go against the grain.\n\nYou have nothing to apologize for, because you've voiced your opinion, and TED HAD NO PROBLEM WITH IT. He didn't care. Nor should he. If he had been upset with you for saying that, then you MIGHT owe him an apology, but you owe no apologies to anyone because your mother got upset on his behalf, when he didn't actually care at all.\n\nThat being said, I totally side with Ted. Some people said he should work more because he's unemployed. He's not \"unemployed,\" he's NON-employed.

He talks shit about equality but isnt willing to put in equal work effort to his ex. \n\nYou are right he might die alone but more likely he will find a doormat to abuse for the rest of his life.\n\nAlso he does not care what you or your mom think because you're women and hes a misogynist", "TBF the OP said he didn't want to do more chores - not any chores \n\nThat's the way I read it as well - he was already doing 50% of the chores, he just didn't feel it was fair to do 90% if the chores because he was home.

Why should I do more than equal just because I live off investments?\"", "Where did you get that from? He did 50% and paid his share of the expenses.", "Can you clarify something?\n\nWas Ted already doing 50% if the chores and his wife wanted more!

If the person you loved was at work for 10-11 hours a day and you don\u2019t work, you wouldn\u2019t want to pick up a little more slack in the home front to help take a little something off her plate? \n\nWhat happens if down the road they have kids and she gets paid maternity leave and so she still contributes the same amount to the household? Do you think the working person is going to take on exactly 50% of all the duties the mother does?

They didn't say don't contribute until you've worked 40 hours a week and the point being if one person is working 40hours in a job then does 6 hours of chores a week and another person is working 1 hour a week and does 6 hours of chores, while the chores are equal, the 'effort' of total labour into the relationship isn't. Your partner could come home and have less stress, be less tired, be ready to go out in the evening or help cook if they have less hours of chores to do while the other partner could pick up half of their chores and still only be putting in 10 hours of labour a week to the partners 43 hours.\n\nIf your partner is working heavily and you are not and you can EASILY take up some slack without being even a marginal burden and you won't, then you're hte asshole.", "Cognitive dissonance within a group is just a fancy term for having different opinions from one another.

We exchange our time and labor for money, if time was more valuable then we wouldn't give it away for money. Also you are literally wasting your valuable time on reddit....\n\nSo the issue of them not being equal is that the ex had to work to earn her income whole he didn't have to work so therefore he had to do more chores, by thay logic he should also contribute less.\n\nAnd this also contradicts your \"time is the most valuable\" bs, why should he waste his valuable time on chores when he covers his part? Should he not waste his valuable time on shit he enjoys?

Your comment is a comment from someone who is actually in a healthy relationship. \n\nI feel like most of the people commenting are either single or in shitty partnerships because if my work load had decreased and my boyfriend\u2019s remained the same I wouldn\u2019t think twice about picking up more of the slack at home so that he could be less stressed out / we could spend more time together.\n\nThat\u2019s because I actually love him and want the best for him (and us as a couple)."]}
