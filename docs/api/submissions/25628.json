I mean, y'all can refer to Gina's half siblings as just siblings if she wants that.  Are you unsure of your ability to continue to provide Gina with a safe, healthy, and happy environment?  I just don't understand why you would want to jump all the way to adoption, when, if you all co-parent as well as you say, you all could just make adjustments as necessary without you basically telling Gina that she's not your child anymore.  That sounds a lot more damaging to her than the current situations.  Without more info, I'm definitely leaning into Y T A.", "Although it may feel like it'd help her be \"more of a family\" with her siblings and not half, it could also mean she feels more pushed out from you.

What would be awful is if Gina was negatively affected by this - a 10yo is not likely to understand your thought process and may just think you don't love her or want to be her mom anymore. Make sure she knows that her siblings are her siblings and she doesn't need to refer to them as \"half siblings\". It would be good for your ex and Sadie to go along with this as well.

In other words, she will feel like you don't want her.\n\nInstead of doing this, explain to your Ex and his wife that you love how great she's been as a Stepmom to your daughter and if something happened and you passed away, you would be okay with Stepmom adopting your child then.", "This is just NOT a question for this sub, IMO.

And by 'folks', I mean lawyers and counselors. Because once she's legally adopted, there's none of this 'I still get the same time with her and be a part of the decision making process' stuff.

She has three parents that she's happy with, nobody could ask for a better result. \n\nI don't quite know how the legal system in your country handles more than 2 parents, but if making Sadie an adoptive parent would make sure Gina is protected in the event that you or Paul are unable to make decisions for her, you should do it. \n\nThe only negative thing I will say is: you should assume that Paul and Sadie will likely present a \"united front\" in any decisions involving Gina.

Even if things are great with Paul and Sadie as coparents now, what if that were to change? You would have no legal recourse if they wanted to make a decision for Gina that you strongly disagreed with, or if they wanted to move away, or forbid you from seeing her. If they were ever to get a divorce, Gina would have to split time between them. You may not think it would ever happen, and maybe it wouldn't--but it could.\n\nSecondly, even though you are thinking of this because you think it would make Gina feel better, I don't think you can be sure she would really take it that way, or fully understand, and that some part of her wouldn't feel rejected by you and really hurt. It sounds like she understands that you, Paul, and Sadie all love her very much. I wouldn't mess with that. Perhaps the three of you could tell her that you wouldn't mind at all if she calls her siblings her siblings, and that she is a *full* part of both of your families. Does Gina see a counselor? That might be a good idea, too. It sounds like you really are doing a great job of coparenting, and Paul and Sadie have done a great job of blending their families, even including you, but talking to a therapist might be helpful for Gina to work through any feelings she has about the situation that she may not feel comfortable sharing with the people involved--all of you.\n\nI don't think you are TA for thinking about this, but you shouldn't do it. Maybe Paul and Sadie could have a ceremony for making Gina and her siblings \"full siblings\" or an official family blending ceremony or something. I think perhaps when Gina is 18, with a therapist's advice, you could offer the idea that she could do an adult adoption with Sadie, as that wouldn't require you to relinquish any parental claim on her, but would legally make her full siblings her siblings.

It isnt what I wanted to hear, but the confirmation of her happiness made the time less painful.", "...during our Financial Order (part of UK divorce) Paul stated he would cover Gina's needs when with him as well as anthing she needs for school/clubs (uniform/trips/school lunch/travel etc)\nHis stilulation was that I do the same (provide all for Gina's needs) during my time with her.\n\nPaul completed his Masters Degree when Gina was an infant and I have always supported him and his career progression. As well as illness from an accident when he was 19yo (we were dating/together then).\n\nI do contribute a small amount, monthly, as Gina is going to Secondary school (UK) and requires more basics (bras/toiletries/personal care items) I dknt warn very much and am single. I always offer \"spending money\" for trips and afew timea have sent money to Paul whrn they have had a holiday abroad (for him and Sadie to have a meal out or towards Gina's flight ticket)\n\nPaul was extremely strict with the financial order and I have offered to send money but he has refused to send bank details.\n\nGina is welcome to take any toys/clothes/items from out place home. \n\nI would always contribute (admittedly it is a pittance but wbat I can afford) out of gratitude and respect to Paul and Sadie", "Fully agree. I have asked Sadie and Paul to discuss this and explain to Gina it is not me walking away or changing x", "No no! I will always be Gina's mother. That is not up for question. It is purely to allow (as legalities in the UK) for Sadie to be able to make day-to-day decisions for Gina.\nTake her to medical appointments and NOT be told \"you are not autborised to make X decision\" or take her to the dentist for braces and have a similar discussion.\n\nI am more than happy to attend any and all appts. But Sadie wishes to be involved too.\n\nFor confirmation, I want NOTHING to change and Gina already calls Sadie \"Mum\" with my suggeated permission.", "Absolutely. I have suggested to Paul and Sadie that if they would like to, then Gina pught to be included. BUT Gina must know it doesn't change me as her bio-mumma that loves her and how present I am \u2764\ufe0f", "But please, be careful about explaining things to Gina in the right way. You are doing this out of love for her, so she could feel more integrated into her new family, but she might easily misunderstand this gesture as you not wanting her anymore.", "Thank you.\n\nEveryone goes through difficult times and we all manage with things differently.  We all have struggles.\n\nMy MH condition is complicated hugely by PPD/PND and being absent (day to day) with Gina. But it stems from brain chemisty and apparently trauma during my cchildhood **shrug**\n\nI want the very very best for Gina. She is old enough to KNOW and enjoys having 3 parents. She likes the \"shock factor\" to new friends lol \ud83d\ude06\n\nGina is very aware of my physical/MH struggles. She knows EXACTLY why Paul and I split and has dine for a long time. She knows everything and underrands and fully accepts all. \n\nShe loves nothing more than telling me about her siblings and we pick out little (small) treats for them (with Paul and Sadie's permission.", "What does that have to do with anything? OP your dynamic works for you and your family right now. The issue seems to be that Gina wants you to stop referring to her siblings as half. So do that. \n\nOnce again it seems like you are trying to have your cake and eat it too. If you can\u2019t be a parent, don\u2019t be a parent. You and Gina may not see it but it does come across you are yanking her around. \n\nYou will not have a say in Gina\u2019s life if she is adopted. That is not how it works.", "Thank you. I am far from amazing but despite my stuff and \"late bonding\" I have always put Gina first. \nPaul and I had a great relationship. He comes from a big (5 kids) blended family and sometiems things weren't easy for him...as in, \"un equal\".\nHis parents and step parents are polite to eachother, they dont speak badly of the others...well not that I have experienced anyway.\n\nI know Paul was very keen to have everyone together for his (our) graduation and his 21st birthday. Pre Gina especally for her special celebrations we made a big effort to ensure that both of Paul's parent-units could attend and feel comfortable and able to enjoy their time but whatever the celebration was.\n\nSadie does this too. Which I fully admire.", "Hahaha! It may come as no suprise...I was under a private Psych for a couple of years and  told I require \"permanent, ongoing regulary talking therapy\".\nI was in talking therapy for just over a year and it did help loads. But (in UK) it is not a service offered (continuously) on the NHS. I cant afford to have private seasions anymore. So here I am, on Reddit \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That's also a very very good point.\nGina has not asked.  Ut also, IDK if ahe realises it is an option.\n\nThat's why I have started to low jey discuss with Paul and Sadie. Also Sadie may be FULLY against it. Not because she doesnt love Gina, just (as others have posted/commented) it us WEIRD.", "Thank you.\n\nI guess I am suggesting now as Gina is still younger (not 18) and my health is good.\n\nI have some complex physical health stuff and (whilst if I recieved twrrible medical newsa it wouldnt change my decision) it would feel more forced, than a decision that Sadie, Gina, Paul can fully comfortably make.\n\nPla dont get me wrong. I am not poorly. I hope not to be, but the reality is I am highly likely to be at some stage and likely earlier than wanted.", "Very very true. Actually I hadn't thought about that.\nGina and I usually spend our weekends with my parents (who are on good terms with Paul and Sadie, as well as.my bro and SIL who live close to my parents) so I guess, if that should happen someone would contact Paul or Sadie.\n\nBut thank you! I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THAT", "That\u2019s different than being adopted and you giving up your parental rights. \n\nI don\u2019t think you fully understand how this situation is going to work.", "This isn\u2019t true. If you\u2019re in the uk then the three of you can fill in a form and go to your local family court to give Sadie parental responsibility without losing yours. See link below.\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/parental-rights-responsibilities/apply-for-parental-responsibility#:~:text=Sign%20a%20parental%20responsibility%20agreement&text=There's%20a%20different%20agreement%20form,a%20passport%20or%20driving%20licence.", "Honestly I don't know Sadie, but if she's the kind of woman and mother I think she is - I don't think she'd want you to go this route either.\n\nOther comments seem a bit harsh, I don't think you simply \"walked away\" as you were having your own battles with MH which I understand. However I do feel this would be the final nail in the coffin when it comes to you and Gina, would strongly suggest not doing this. \n\nKeep this as they are, I'm UK too and you can have people to speak on your behalf - if medical appointments etc are your main concern, consider something like this or less \"final\" than adoption papers.\n\nGood luck with this, props to you all for making what could have been a messy situation work for you all.", "Try r/relationship_advice\n\nYou're clearly not an AH! You just want advice about doing the best thing for your daughter.", "Look, this really isn't something where you should be influenced by reddit, its fun here, but no. I don't know if you still have therapy/counselling but if Jordan, please seek it out. You can't change the past and you need to find a way to live with it without constantly punishing yourself. None of us are perfect, we all make mistakes, you've done an amazing job to be where you are and as Gina grows up, you can share your journey with her, help her understand there are many paths. For now, I'd say of rhe coparenting works this well, just let it work.", "yes everything is going great right now what happens if after you give up your parental rights things change - you could have a disagreement with them and they decide to cut all contact with you including contact with Gina or maybe paul might get offered a better job in another city/county and they take Gina away from you, keep your parental rights that way you have a say on EVERYTHING regarding your daughter", "Sorry just chipping in on this too - this is a conversation you need to be having with Gina, no one else. The more it comes from others (if you did do it, again I strongly advise not to) the more it will look like you are indeed walking away.", "Giving up legal rights doesn\u2019t allow you to make 1/3 permission for a child that isn\u2019t legally yours. You wouldn\u2019t be able to make all of those medical decisions for Gina cause you\u2019re not the legal parent.\n\nNow you could find a way to authorize Sadie to do all of this without having to give up your full rights.", "Then there\u2019s no need for her to be adopted.\n\nOP I don\u2019t mean to dismiss your struggles but it comes across that you still have one foot in and one foot out with parenting. If Gina is adopted there\u2019s no keeping this dynamic. You are giving up your parental rights. If things are going well, why does it need to change? Why not refer to her siblings as siblings. Take the half out; it doesn\u2019t matter.", "couldnt agree more.", "I am reliant on the trust I have built as a co-parent and the relationship between Paul (18yrs) and Sadie (7yrs) as well as the continued support from Paul's sister, mum and (step) dad.\n\nI don't want Gina or anyone to think I am walking away. I am not! But realistically, if Gina were to have an accident/fall sick (god forbid) and only Sadie is there. I trust the love Sadie has for Gina. \n\nSadie treats Gina the same as her children. Even before she welcomed her babies. When Gina is poorly, Sadie stays up all night and helps her. Gina is experiencing \"girl hormone discomfort\" and feels comfortable with Sadie. Most importantly, Gina talks to eachnof us about different things. She trusts us but has the option to chose who to talk to. Some things she prefers to confide in Sadie with.\nSome things me and a few things Paul.\n\nGina has grown up with 3 parents. She is proud she has 3 and happy to explain whrn friends ask why.\n\nThe only draw back for Gina, if it is one...IF she is naughty/badly behaved at home/mine (which is very rare!) we co tinue the set \"punishment\". For example, last year Gina spoke back to Paul and Sadie and was rude. She was told no tablet or (heavily monitored) internet for a week. 2 days after the event she was with me and I continued it, calmy explained why and Gina was satisfied and apologised (to me). I told her that I am grateful but it would be best to apologise to \"mum and dad\". She did and asked to call them, then made a card and (according to Paul) apologised and hugged them when she got home. She still had to have the remainder of the week as punishment but she was ok with it.", "Thank you!", "All of this!", "Why? In the event that something happens to Paul or Paul and Sadie. If so Gina will no longer have any legal ties to her half siblings or Sadie. I would definitely consult a lawyer on this.", "OP you just keep using examples as how Sadie had made a sacrifice and stepped up for a child that wasn\u2019t hers. She did the work you didn\u2019t put in and in my interpretation, you still don\u2019t do. \n\nOnce again you\u2019re trying to have your cake and eat it too. Yeah you think you\u2019re doing what\u2019s best for you kid but it doesn\u2019t change the fact you did walk away and it seems like you\u2019re still trying to forgo responsibility. Giving up your parental rights will not give you 1/3 way in Gina. Do you think folks who give their kids up for adoption still give say? Not they don\u2019t.", "I hate to come across as I unsympathetic because MH for women during and after pregnancy is a huge thing, but this is just bizarre. They have a great dynamic that works for them. But someone else is doing all the \u201chard\u201d work and OP wants to relinquish all the rights but still be involved without doing the work? It seems unfair to a lot of folks.", "OP needs to understand that she doesn\u2019t get to just keep not being a fully present parent and still get a say in all things Gina. That\u2019s not how adoption will work.", "Eat your cake and have it too* Sorry, just when I learned the correct order, it blew my mind a little.", "Wow! \n\nThank you for appreciating Sadie.\n\nI never walked away from Gina. I wish I could be qith her every day and as I have commented (on another response) I am dealing with the MH affects of not being with her.\n\nI know legally I do not get a say (should Sadie adopt) However, we.co-parent as a 3 (have done for years, so all get 1/3 decision) It wouldnt be any different to how it already is. Paul claims Child Benefit, so in the UK that means he ia the PRIMARY parent in most situations", ">I never walked away from Gina.\n\nYeah you did. A lot of women who give birth don't get the luxury of just making their partner the primary parent and just walking away from that full responsibility.  I have to wonder what you even did at first with your PPD before you walked away.\n\nYou made that choice. You also claim that because of your autoimmune disease you can't be a parent fully. Not everyone gets that luxury. You can keep throwing out that coparenting thing all you want. It does change a lot. \n\nAs far as I can read/tell Paul and Sadie seem to be more of Gina's parent. You come across as that fun aunt."]}
