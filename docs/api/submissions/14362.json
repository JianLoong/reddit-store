I loved the two of them and considered Jessica a good friend of mine, and Abigail a friend, she got me a job when I needed it, and we always had good times together. \n\nWell time comes around and wedding invites etc, and I didn\u2019t get an invite.  I always assumed that I would because all of us are in a group chat, hangout pretty frequently etc.  after talking to another friend in the group, it turns out they had to make some decisions for $.  I understand, weddings are expensive.  It was hurtful if I\u2019m being honest, but Im trying my best to recognize that while we\u2019re close, I\u2019m not as close to Jessica as my other four friends are.  It sucks for me because it\u2019s just this thing that everyone in what is essentially my closest friend circle is going to but me.  I am still happy for her and excited for their love, despite the fact that I feel excluded.  \n\nAnyway, yesterday we were driving for another friends birthday celebration to an aquarium as a friend group.  On the ride back she takes a FaceTime from a friend.  They started talking about the wedding, for like 30 minutes.  It honestly just made me upset and sad all at once.  At one point her friend in FaceTime mentioned some other person who wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding, and Jessica pretty much said \u201cyeah bring her along, I talk to her like every day\u201d\n\nThis really bothered me that she essentially invited someone to her wedding right in front of me.  I stayed quiet and didn\u2019t say anything.  Im starting to feel the distance between us and I\u2019m questioning our friendship entirely at this point.. Am i being selfish and not just being happy for Jessica?

As long as everything you said here is accurate, there are other reasons why you were intentionally left out of the wedding.", "Feeling hurt does not make you the AH.  Jessica probably  does not feel the same level of friendship  as you.  Not much you can do besides ask another of your friend group if they know what's going on.", "NTA but jessica sure is. I knew a jessica in school who would interject herself into me and my friend's conversations and completely ignore me to talk to my friend. Completely tone deaf and unaware to how her words and actions affect others.\n\nEven though she's free to invite who ever she wants to the wedding, she sounds like she's actually trying to alienate you from the rest of your friends, I mean really? inviting someone based on a whim even tho she had \"money issues\". \n\nOP I'd consider branching out and potentially finding a new friend group. Jessica sounds really unlikeable to me.", "NTA\n\n\nLike I been in your shoes and feel your pain dude.  Yes, Jessica have the right to choose who she wants in her wedding but found it odd how she behaves around you.  Personally, I think you should open to her how you feel, in a calming manner and asked her if you can be invited, for you do feel left out from the group.  If she says no, then respect that.\n\nHeck, this remind me from another Reddit I heard I think almost a year ago that a guy was in the same shoes as you and asking if he was the AH for having those feelings over a coworkers wedding.  Everyone in the office was invited except OP all the way to the wedding.  He was hurt, hearing everyone talking about the wedding after from everyone and still wonder \u201cwhy?\u201d He was the only one left out.  Turns out, the bride of the coworker didn\u2019t want him there cause he had the same interest as OP and didn\u2019t want them to hook up, for OP is her type? That\u2019s what I got from that.", "Nta but you need to quietly move on.  I personally wouldn\u2019t bring up the issue of not being invited, I\u2019d just quietly quit \u2026 we can\u2019t force people into involving or loving us more but we know our own self worth\u2026and when it\u2019s time to leave.", "NTA- you're being very thoughtful with how you're handling this, especially since it is extremely gauche to talk about an event in front of someone clearly not invited. I'm sorry you have to deal with that, it feels really bad to be left out.", "NTA. That is hurtful, she is being thoughtless about you, probably because she is excited about her wedding (bridezilla). You can give her grace whilst readjusting your expectations for your friendship- put less emotional energy into her, and let go. It will take some time.", "NTA, I think you are on to something.", "NTA\n\nI thought this would go a different way but everyone in the friend's group got invited but you? and then she invites a random person to the wedding in front of you? Are you sure you two are close? Got to be honest, I'd ask Jessica about the situation. If your post is accurate, none of this makes any sense", "You're NTA. This is just disrespectful and tbh should give you an idea of just how much (or in this case , little) your friendship is valued and respected. Take this as a big neon sign to leave this friendship and find people who want to share big life events with you. If it was truly that they didn't have space/budget and had to make some hard choices then I'd go N A H, but inviting someone else along right in front of you just seems cruel. \n\nQuestion though, what is your role in this friendship group? Because I get serious user vibes from those people. If you're the one that drives, has the better house for hang outs, pays for things, or does any other act of service that they can take advantage of then this was never really about friendship and likely more about how much they can drain out of you. I could be way off, but idk, I've been the friend that was soooo close but never quite close enough to be invited to the big moments.", "NTA. You did a great job at being considerate of their financial decisions for their wedding, the least they can do is to be sensitive of your feelings.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA.\n\nHey, just to let you know that in the whole of our friend group, I was the only one not invited. Was that a mistake? If not, let me tell you that this is hurtful. It's you wedding, you invite whomever you want, but I thought we were closer than that and that's why I'm puzzled and hurt. I sincerely hope you have the wedding of your dreams even if I'm not there, I'll see the pictures later on.\n\nWith love, OP.", "NTA at all.\n\nJessica is not really your friend. She doesn't care about you, she most likely doesn't consider you at all. The fact that she'd take a 30m facetime while spending time with you and invite some rando to the wedding she intentionally left you out of speaks volumes as to her character and motivations as they pertain to you. She also appears to have no manners.\n\nI wouldn't even bother talking to her about it unless you're ok with getting a pity invite and knowing she's probably talking about it behind your back to your mutual friends. Especially if she's already told you that she thinks you're argumentative. \n\nIf I were in your shoes I would take this for the light bulb moment it was and just drop the rope and walk away. You don't need someone in your life who makes you feel this way.\n\nEdit: typo", "When people show you who they are, believe them. She does not consider you a friend. There is no need to confront her or attempt to explain your feelings or ask her for an explanation. Maintain your friendship with the people who are your actual friends and for Jessica and Abigail, just be polite, but dont go out of your way for them. You are just 2 people with friends in common, not friends.", "NTA. You have just as much right to feel upset\u2014as Jessica has the right to invite whoever she wants to her wedding. That said, I feel bad for you for having to sit there for a half an hour while she blathered on and on about the wedding that she didn\u2019t invite you to. And then she casually and verbally invited another person, despite her concerns about money.\n\nThe fact that you haven\u2019t said anything about how you feel says that you\u2019re a class act, unlike Jessica, who seems totally tone deaf and tactless. Maybe this \u2018friend\u2019 doesn\u2019t value your friendship as much as you do. Just stay classy and keep your disappointment to yourself, because saying something would serve no purpose other than to cause them all to gang up on you. Sorry for your upset feelings.", "Info: if she is such a good friend in your opinion why can\u2019t you just tell her how you feel?", "NTA. It does suck when you realise someone doesn\u2019t view your friendship in quite the same way you do.", "NTA. It is rude and disrespectful to discuss an event that someone is not invited to in their presence. Also, who the hell takes a 30 min FaceTime while hanging out with other people? Sounds like Jessica is super rude and inconsiderate in general.", "NTA\n\nJessica has zero manners. Are you sure you\u2019re not invited? Her behavior was truly inappropriate & you should have called her out on it. \n\nEveryone hates feeling left out. It sounds like you have been very gracious & Jessica may not deserve your kindness. Schedule something fun to do with other people on that day.", "Your soon-to-be-married friend said she didn\u2019t invite you because of $$ but then later invited someone else who had not been invited yet essentially on a whim?\n\nIn her eyes, you aren\u2019t her friend, you are  an acquaintance.  You need to realize that she doesn\u2019t see you in the same way you see her and move on. \n\nNTA", "Thanks man.  I offered to drive!  I don\u2019t feel used, the rest of the group are all really good friends of mine, who I truly consider to have my best interests in mind.  I appreciate you looking out, it\u2019s just Jessica as the issue here I believe", "Thanks.  I haven\u2019t really brought this up to Jessica in her defense, it\u2019s just awkward.  I have mentioned it to the rest of my friend group so I feel like she may know, maybe she should intuitively know that it feels bad?", "NTA. It is rude and disrespectful to discuss an event that someone is not invited to in their presence.", "Thanks.  Yeah I want to mention it but honestly worry about the nightmare scenario of getting a pity invite, then me saying no because I don\u2019t want to be fucking pity invited, then her just saying I\u2019m argumentative and dramatic for not coming.  Or if i do go, just feeling like I hamfisted myself into an event.", "Well I initially wanted to, but felt awkward bringing up how I felt because the situation was about money, so I didn\u2019t want to make her feel\nGuilty over my emotions.  This recent occurrence has just made me question everything - I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it to talk to her about", "It sure does.", "OP needs better friends and stop investing time and energy maintaining a one way friendship.", "INFO: Have you broached the subject with Jessica? What about other members of the friend group? Are they aware that you are the only one from the group who wasn't invited? \n\nYou're NTA, but I'm curious about how everyone else in the group is treating this.", "As long as you're happy enough then that's the main thing. I've read too many aita now that it doesn't help with not seeing people in a bad light! I'm glad you have the rest of them, hopefully it won't be a package deal with Jessica forever and that they all start seeing the problems. If not, it's likely still worth branching out to find other people you relate to, just because it can  bring a balance when Jessica feels too much. As it is I'd go as low contact with her as you can. She's allowed to do whatever she wants with her wedding, invite whoever. But she's being tactless and kinda cruel to plan it out when she knows you're not invited. There are friends I love but haven't invited to my wedding, but I don't go on about it in front of them, because I love and care about them.", "Of course, it's an extremely awkward situation. But the way she nonchalantly invited someone she doesn't know *that* well probably means she either forgot or doesn't care that you weren't invited. You need better friends, OP. So sorry that you're going through this.", "For heaven's sake just talk to Jessica and tell her how you feel about everything. What's the worst she can do - not invite you to the wedding? It's very thoughtless of her all round and you need some clarity to determine whether you two are friends or not.", "I think you're doing an excellent job of finding some clarity here. Without a doubt it has to hurt like hell, and that's awful. It sounds like your other friends really fill your cup, so to speak. Nurture those relationships and drop the dead weight. \ud83d\udc99", "Doesn\u2019t sound like she values your friendship so much as you values hers, may be time to distance yourself for a bit", "Yeah, the rest of the group is amazing, but I\u2019m not gonna invest anything into this one anymore.  Yo be fair, we were super low maintenance friends, which kind of explains the lack of invite.  \n\nShe has also said she thinks I\u2019m argumentative, but we followed up with a convo about it that was honestly very insightful where I opened up to her saying that\u2019s definitely a problem, I\u2019ll work on it in therapy, and she even said to me that it\u2019s not really that bad, just that she notices sometimes I poke st things (not in an overly aggressive way)  that\u2019s really the only negative thing I can think of, maybe that\u2019s enough to not get invited", "Haven\u2019t broached with Jessica.  Two of my friends in the group are aware.  The person I\u2019m closest with was the other person in the car with me.  We talked about it (before this event) and she was like i get why you\u2019re feeling that way, but we\u2019re all just much closer to her etc.  i was like yeah i understand, but essentially said, if she liked me enough, she\u2019d invite me, and she didn\u2019t, so she doesn\u2019t.  To which my friend was like \u201cwell when you say it like that it sounds so harsh\u201d", "Thanks dude.  I don\u2019t know how well she knows this other person but yeah, it just makes it obvious to me it wasn\u2019t about money.  All good", "I just don\u2019t want to cause any strife.  Our group has had schisms in the past, funny enough related to Jessica.  I don\u2019t want the drama", "Love the metaphor.  Thanks stranger - to filling our cups \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "Sometimes people just don't click. Inviting someone In front of you was tacky but it speaks more about her than you. Now you know the value she places on your friendship. Don't feel bad or sad, she's not worth it.", "There is an outside chance that your invite has been lost somewhere & she\u2019s talking in front of you as she assumes you\u2019re going. It\u2019s worth a conversation with her in case - follow your gut if you\u2019re invited afterward.", "Accept the consequences of being a doormat then. Yeah, that's harsh but this is exactly what you are setting yourself up to be, or are perpetuating. You have feelings, why should you put them aside to avoid \"drama\" when this girl shows no respect for you at all and doesn't mind causing drama for you? Screw the schisms, either you have friends or you don't, no inbetween. Your real friends will stand by you. Have some self-respect and stand up for yourself, and definitely don't hang out with others who don't want you there.\n\nI know I'm coming across as extremely harsh but I think you need to hear this. It comes from far too much experience of being in similar positions to your one here. When you show people you aren't prepared to put up with their shit they show their true colours, then you can decide which way to go. Trust me, you deserve better than you are getting from hour \"friend\"  Jessica. I wish you the best of luck and a positive outcome.", "I would say you\u2019re right, but during this car ride she actually asked the person in front with me, \u201cHey girl, did you not get your invite?\u201d To which the girl said \u201cnot yet.\u201d  That friend was being cool and she knows how much it hurt me, so she just was talking to me and started playing some music to distract me.  It didn\u2019t work but was well intentioned.  I do wish that maybe she stood up for me but that\u2019s not fair, it was her bday and no one wants drama"]}
