As others have said, very disturbing that that\u2019s where his mind goes first. Have you tried to clarify/ did anyone else witness the exchange?", "NTA\n\nThe girls is amazing around here siblings and your words are nothing bad.\n\nIts his mind which makes a sad connection.", "Wtf?! NTA! I don\u2019t understand how her father automatically jumped to the conclusion that you meant anything inappropriate about a 7 year old little girl. It was just a passing comment that could be made about most children crawling around on the floor. It blows my mind that he took offence so quickly and that he appears to be holding it against you \ud83e\udd2f", "NTA I personally would have found that hilarious because clearly you were not implying that your 7 year old niece is a hoochie \ud83d\ude02 I think it\u2019s bizarre that he would automatically jump to that conclusion tbh because sex and children are like\u2026 on completely other universes in my mind and they never meet unless I have another nightmare about getting knocked up \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "NTA\n\nGuy needs to chill.", "NTA context should've made it clear you weren't saying what he thinks you were", "Whoopsie!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nI'm sure you explained you meant because she was crawling.  I don't expect your 7 year old niece was offended.\n\nI think this is genuinely one of those \"We'll laugh about it later\" moments.  \n\nNTA", "NTA he took it the wrong way", "NTA", "Well you are NTA, but so is her father. Maybe. I hope this isnt some sort of projection on BOTH your parts. Its definitely weird.", "NTA. Dad can relax.", "NAH, you had poor wording but didn't mean any harm, but the dads not ta for getting defensive either", "NTA and it's super weird he assumes a comment about his daughter who is clearly crawling around on her knees is a sexual one. Why is he sexualising his 7 year old?? Creepy and weird.", "NTA. \n\nIf you were making the wagging eyebrows and otherwise joking like that \"*because of the implication*\", then he'd have a case to be upset. \n\nAs much as I am a fan of crass and juvenile jokes would have snapped to reality and realized how it was intended. \n\nI'm guessing he's embarrassed that he felt he sexualized his kid, but he needs to let that go.", "YTA - Doesn't matter what you meant - know your audience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I did not apologize for saying it\n\nWhy not? Even a faux pas deserves a little humility once in a while.", "NTA\u2026but maybe you touched a nerve??? Just sayin\u2026", "NTA You were just making an observation. And young children do spend a lot of time on their knees because they play on the floor or the ground. \n\nKind of makes one wonder why her dad was so quick to take offense by it.", "NTA. Your kid is an active, playing child and your comment was within context. It was your DAD, not YOU, who sexualized the comment and changed the context. That alone is gross, but that isn't on you. It's on him. Which is creepy tbh.", "Gonna take a slightly different direction and say NAH pending N T A. It's possible there was some kind of comment or allegation made in relation to someone doing something to your niece that you don't know about. If not, the comment is weird, but honestly not 100% the weirdest thing I've heard of overprotective dads saying about their young daughters, especially with the sexualizing culture that exists in the US in particular (read: baby's clothing talking about boyfriends/girlfriends or being hot or etc.)", "NTA. Super weird his mind went there.", "NTA. \n\nYou made a comment that was misunderstood. You tried to correct it, dad is clinging to the misunderstanding for some reason. Probably has some feels about it. That\u2019s his problem though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re not TA for accidentally putting your foot in your mouth, but it would have been good form to apologise and say that you didn\u2019t mean it that way and only realised that it sounded wrong afterwards.\n\nHer father is also not TA because he might well have misunderstood and thought that you were sexualising his daughter. In which case it\u2019s fully understandable why he can\u2019t see you in the same way.", "Indeed! She is so great with her younger siblings, and they really look out for each other.", "Yup, exactly!", "I know right!", "Thank you.!", "I would have said it no different if it was her socks that were worn because she was running around a lot.", "Is it poor wording though? I mean how else would I explain it? I guess maybe I should have continued the thought/sentence.", "I hope it's embarrassment", "Tbh, my thoughts as well.", "It's weird how some parents sexualize things. Your hear too much of that these days to be honest. I saw a video the other day on reddit where some mom was bitching at another mom for her daughter wearing a bikini in front of her son. Like WTF!", "Eh, I think a LOT of parents are on high alert for other people making sexual comments  - which leads to a lot of false alarms.\n\nSo I don't believe dad was sexualizing her as much as I believe he is terrified that someone will sexualize her because he wants to keep her safe, and so he shuts down anyone else's attempts to be inappropriate around his baby girl.\n\nBut in this case his hypervigilance is misplaced, lol", "Omg. This did not even cross my mind. Sometimes there's shit going on that you don't know about and it can coincide with a comment and it makes a terrible situation. Like if someone had something stolen and they hear someone got what they had stolen that same week, it may or may not be theirs, and it could just be a coincidence. Not sure if I am explaining it right, but I get what you mean.", "Exactly. Some people make jokes like that throughout their life, but it's usually within their own age groups. No one (imo) would make this same mistake given the age and circumstances.", "Good morning and thank you very much for this kind reply.\n\nI wish you a happy day with cordial greetings from Switzerland.", "Still don't think you're an A, but some examples:    \n    \n\"Yeah, she likes to play outside a lot\"     \n   \n\"You know how kids are, going through clothes like wildfire!\"    \n    \nEtc", "it definitely would have been better to say something along the lines of \"its just from her crawling\". just saying \"she's on her knees a lot\" does come with a pretty inherent nsfw connotation, especially when said towards a woman or girl. \n\ni mean, myself and many of my female friends/ co-workers have had that sentence or something similar said to us by men in very creepy/ sexual ways when we were just doing something innocent like stocking a shelf or cleaning so when i first read your post my mind also went immediately to that. \n\nthe dad wasn't having creepy thoughts of his daughter, he jus obviously knows that, socially, that is something that is often said towards women and girls in a creepy way. you had innocent intentions but he was just protecting his daughter", "How old are you OP? That is a big factor In whether you could be seen as TA by her dad, or not.", "These are the same parents who complain about society oversexualizing kids and yet telling them they have to be Insta pretty. Makes me think of the parents who think drag queens are bad and child beauty pageants with fake hair and teeth are good (when, in fact, drag queens are awesome and child pageants are dangerous). And the bikini? HAHAHAHAHA. Craziness. It's a bathing suit. Nothing more, nothing less.", "Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's a for sure thing, I don't know your family or the people your niece has been around. It's way more likely that he's just overprotective. But it's sadly still a possibility and that's one of the reasons I can think of for having such a reactionary response.", "Happy day to you as well! :)", "But its a kid...why would anyone think of what he said as sexual,weird ahh people", "Thank you :-)"]}
