You aren't her caregiver or her Mommy.  It's not your job to make her breakfast or tell her what to pack.  Your roommate needs to get her own shit together.", "NTA, you\u2019re roommates. Your obligation is pay your part of housing and help keep your shared space clean. That\u2019s it. Your roommate needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\nYou are her roommate not her mother.

She is old enough to take care of herself, plus what is she going to do when she has a job.", "NTA, you are not her mother. Get a new roommate", "NTA. Your roommate is so naive to think you are in anyway responsible for for her getting ready in the morning. Part of being an adult is learning how to fend on your own", "Good lord, does your school know they admitted a child who still needs a parent to get them ready for class? You are NTA and roomie needs to move back home with mommy and daddy.", "NTA and please give me a moment to laugh my ass off. Ahem. Ok. She\u2019s an adult. Responsible for herself. You are not her mom. Her boyfriend. Her bestie. She needs to wake up and realize no one is responsible for her but her.  Make her breakfast? Hahahahahaha", "O HELL NO it\u2019s all on her", "NTA. That's entirely her responsibility.", "Nta your not her mom and your not her maid. If she wants breakfast she needs to get up much  earlier or buy the grab and go breakfast. \n\nNta. She needs to step up and adult. She knows what her schedule is like. So she knows what exactly she needs for her next class. She can set her supplies in her backpack the night before and stop blaming you because she can't figure it out on her own.", "Yes! And at her age, even her mother shouldn't be held accountable.

No one is responsible for her but herself. Not her mum, roommate, or anyone. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f This can\u2019t be real can it?", "NTA. What, is she 5 years old? Ridiculous.", "I doubt this is real. Op has got to be pretty delusional to question this.", "NTA. This has to be a joke, right?", "NTA.\n\nTell her that you never accepted the job of being her personal assistant/stand-in mother. \n\nIf you feel like it, offer to do it for pay. Be sure to offer for an amount high enough to be worth your doing it. (Yes, she\u2019ll probably refuse angrily *because how dare you not just handle all her responsibilities for her for free!* but there\u2019s some chance she might accept!)\n\nHell, if SHE won\u2019t take care of HER OWN responsibilities for free, why should you?", "NTA, welcome to the real world, roommate. Op, don't even think for a moment you are responsible for your roommate. Just because her parents failed at raising her, doesn't mean you have to pick up their slack.", "NTA.\n\nYou're her roommate, not her mother. It is not your responsibility to teach her how to adult.", "NTA \n\nJust ask her if she wants you to wipe her ass too?", "Your job is to make it to your own classes, do your best and have a good college experience. Period. You're her roommate, not an employee or Mommy substitute!!!", "She's just fucking jealous you get to sleep in and she doesn't.\n\nNta.\n\nNext time she brings it up laugh in her face and tell her to jog on.", "NTA. It sounds like she's jealous that you get to sleep longer in the morning.", "Nta you're not in a relationship or her parent", "NTA - tell her to move back home if she's needing a mommy to help her out.", "And that roommate needs to get a grip on adulthood. NTA", "she was gaslighting for a hot moment so i was kinda confused \nshe said rommates are supposed to help each other in times of hardships and thats what makes us humans \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Like sharing  food if she comes back and there is nothing to cook but not parenting her", "Yeah, tell her everyone on reddit is laughing at her, and show her this thread.", "NTA.  So going into class and making breakfast for herself are hardships?  Well she\u2019ll never make it after university.  You gonna make sure she gets to work too?  Does she have bad anxiety about walking by herself?  It\u2019s still not your problem.  If she does, she needs to speak to a therapist or a physician."]}
