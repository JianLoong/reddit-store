You aren't her caregiver or her Mommy.  It's not your job to make her breakfast or tell her what to pack.  Your roommate needs to get her own shit together.", "NTA, you\u2019re roommates. Your obligation is pay your part of housing and help keep your shared space clean. That\u2019s it. Your roommate needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\nYou are her roommate not her mother.

Your roommate is so naive to think you are in anyway responsible for for her getting ready in the morning.

You are NTA and roomie needs to move back home with mommy and daddy.", "NTA and please give me a moment to laugh my ass off. Ahem. Ok. She\u2019s an adult. Responsible for herself.

That's entirely her responsibility.", "Nta your not her mom and your not her maid. If she wants breakfast she needs to get up much  earlier or buy the grab and go breakfast. \n\nNta.

She can set her supplies in her backpack the night before and stop blaming you because she can't figure it out on her own.", "Yes! And at her age, even her mother shouldn't be held accountable.
