Everyone around me says yes, but I feel super gaslighted by my husband\u2019s family right now.  We are both late 20s, no kids.  We added my MIL to our cell plan a few years ago when we got married because she lives alone and didn\u2019t have a cell phone.  My husband thinks it will keep her safer to have one for emergencies.  At the time we added her, for her phone and plan it was around $20 extra per month.  Plan costs have gone up and she got a nicer phone so now it\u2019s close to $50 per month.  Pretty steep, with the way the economy is, am I right?  \n\nAnyway, my husband\u2019s brother has a young kid, he\u2019s 8.  He\u2019s a nice kid, but not my responsibility.  When I called my MILs cellphone a few days ago, my nephew answered.  I asked him if he was at Grandmas house and if I could talk to her.  He said no, he was at his house and Grandma has given him her cellphone to keep because his parents wouldn\u2019t get him one.  \n\nMy MIL didn\u2019t tell me or my husband about this and I got pretty angry.  I\u2019m already not thrilled about paying for HER to have a cellphone, I\u2019m definitely not happy about paying for my 8 yr old nephew to have it!  I went to her house and told her that if she she wasn\u2019t going to use the phone, I was going to take it off our plan and that I wanted the iPhone back from nephew because my husbands screen is cracked and he can have hers.  It will save us a few hundred bucks since we won\u2019t have to buy a new phone.  \n\nNeedless to say, she\u2019s mad now because \u201cit\u2019s her phone to do with as she pleases and she wants nephew to have it\u201d.

If they wanted to keep it to use with wifi, it's murkier. The phone could be considered a gift, the plan is paying for a service she isn't using.\n\n\nBut why did you buy a nice phone? You could buy a dumb phone with minutes or something. What plan do you have where an extra line is $50?", "NTA. It was thoughtful and generous of you to buy a phone and pay for the plan for your MIL in case of emergency.  She was rude and ungrateful to just give it way and expect you to continue paying for it.

It's a leased resource being provided at someone else's cost.  She's not entitled to hand it off to an 8 year old because his parents aren't providing him one.

Regardless, you should not be paying for a plan for your nephew- that\u2019s what parents are for. \n\nMy one suggestion would be to get your MIL one of those cheap Pre-paid simple cell phones that can only make calls and can\u2019t access the internet. Your husband wants her to have it for emergencies, now she has the one feature required in an emergency. If she gives it away then your nephew only has the ability to make calls till the minutes run out, and it costs you nothing. This is also test if they are truly gaslighting you. I suspect nephew, his parents and MIL all are, because they want a free iPhone for the nephew and will complain right away. Your husband might be more angry that you cancelled it with little warning, but if he is still upset when you provide this solution that will show his true feelings. \n\nINFO for all readers: Maybe as a mid-30s DINK (double income no kids) that is, and forever will be, without children by choice I\u2019m out of the loop\u2026.

If they didn't get him one cause they don't want to pay, that settles the reason for why they and MIL are mad. They don't get to freeload off you. Hubby can pay for it if he wants, that's HIS mom.
