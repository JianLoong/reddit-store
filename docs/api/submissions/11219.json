Everyone around me says yes, but I feel super gaslighted by my husband\u2019s family right now.  We are both late 20s, no kids.  We added my MIL to our cell plan a few years ago when we got married because she lives alone and didn\u2019t have a cell phone.  My husband thinks it will keep her safer to have one for emergencies.  At the time we added her, for her phone and plan it was around $20 extra per month.  Plan costs have gone up and she got a nicer phone so now it\u2019s close to $50 per month.  Pretty steep, with the way the economy is, am I right?  \n\nAnyway, my husband\u2019s brother has a young kid, he\u2019s 8.  He\u2019s a nice kid, but not my responsibility.  When I called my MILs cellphone a few days ago, my nephew answered.  I asked him if he was at Grandmas house and if I could talk to her.  He said no, he was at his house and Grandma has given him her cellphone to keep because his parents wouldn\u2019t get him one.  \n\nMy MIL didn\u2019t tell me or my husband about this and I got pretty angry.  I\u2019m already not thrilled about paying for HER to have a cellphone, I\u2019m definitely not happy about paying for my 8 yr old nephew to have it!  I went to her house and told her that if she she wasn\u2019t going to use the phone, I was going to take it off our plan and that I wanted the iPhone back from nephew because my husbands screen is cracked and he can have hers.  It will save us a few hundred bucks since we won\u2019t have to buy a new phone.  \n\nNeedless to say, she\u2019s mad now because \u201cit\u2019s her phone to do with as she pleases and she wants nephew to have it\u201d.

If they wanted to keep it to use with wifi, it's murkier. The phone could be considered a gift, the plan is paying for a service she isn't using.\n\n\nBut why did you buy a nice phone? You could buy a dumb phone with minutes or something. What plan do you have where an extra line is $50?", "NTA. It was thoughtful and generous of you to buy a phone and pay for the plan for your MIL in case of emergency.  She was rude and ungrateful to just give it way and expect you to continue paying for it.

It's a leased resource being provided at someone else's cost.  She's not entitled to hand it off to an 8 year old because his parents aren't providing him one.

Regardless, you should not be paying for a plan for your nephew- that\u2019s what parents are for. \n\nMy one suggestion would be to get your MIL one of those cheap Pre-paid simple cell phones that can only make calls and can\u2019t access the internet. Your husband wants her to have it for emergencies, now she has the one feature required in an emergency. If she gives it away then your nephew only has the ability to make calls till the minutes run out, and it costs you nothing. This is also test if they are truly gaslighting you. I suspect nephew, his parents and MIL all are, because they want a free iPhone for the nephew and will complain right away. Your husband might be more angry that you cancelled it with little warning, but if he is still upset when you provide this solution that will show his true feelings. \n\nINFO for all readers: Maybe as a mid-30s DINK (double income no kids) that is, and forever will be, without children by choice I\u2019m out of the loop\u2026.

If they didn't get him one cause they don't want to pay, that settles the reason for why they and MIL are mad. They don't get to freeload off you. Hubby can pay for it if he wants, that's HIS mom.

I expected the MIL and parents to be AH's but the husband was a bonus AH that I didnt see comin.", "It\u2019s short and sweet, but\u2026 coming from someone who works in accounts receivable, you would be UTTERLY SURPRISED how defensive people get when you ask them to pay you your money. I guarantee what\u2019s gonna happen is that kid is gonna break the phone entirely, and that\u2019s when her MIL will try to give it back to her.", "Ugh, we got granny a life alert because she wouldn\u2019t keep her cell phone on her - she left that at home, too!", "*Added* to the plan cost, most likely.", "His parents think he has a good shot at being a top influencer.  But you gotta start young.", "The thing is, your MIL is an adult and is allowed to not want a cell phone. You and your hubby might be a little bit Y T A for forcing the issue.\n\nThat said, you are NTA for cancelling the plan and taking the phone back.", "I'm sorry, but if you are really worried about your parents-in-law's safety, you should get them a subscription to LifeAlert or something like that. It is highly unlikely that forcing them to have cell phones would have helped in either of the situations you described. For you MIL's heart attack, if she couldn't get to the landline, it is unlikely she would have been able to get to the cell phone, especially if she had just thrown it in a drawer somewhere and hasn't charged it in months. As far as your FIL's accident, *he rolled his car*. It is unlikely a cell phone would have survived that intact and he still would have had to walk all that way to get help.\n\nLifeAlert, OnStar and other safety programs like that are designed exactly for the situations you described. Cell phones were not.", "Um..I am 58, have my own phone and own phone plan.  Cause I am an adult like that.", "I have an 8-year-old grandchild and I am only 52. Also, I have my own cellphone and plan and pay my own bills (and am raising my two grandchildren) because I am an adult and a good 20 years from retirement. You don't suddenly become old and decrepit when your first grandchild is born.", "They gifted the phone to MIL. You can\u2019t give someone a gift and then limit what they can do with it. MIL could give the phone away if she wants. OP just wasted money - live and learn. Phone plans follow people not phones. If I sell my phone I don\u2019t also sell my phone plan. So OP is correct to cut off the plan. But the phone itself was a gift. You don\u2019t take back gifts.", "Why not just get a landline?", "They shouldn\u2019t? I didn\u2019t think I implied that they should. My intention was to say that a gift given is a gift given and it\u2019s not really ok to demand that back but if they\u2019re still paying for it, it\u2019s not the same thing. where I am often with a phone you\u2019re paying not only for the plan, but you\u2019re paying a monthly amount against the phone so in that case, it definitely makes sense for OP to get the phone back. But if the phone was purchased out right then OP really only has a right to cancel the plan and not the right to the phone.", "> Bingo^Bingo", "that would probably have happened as well.", "I think OP said she got the phone back already", "Buddy, I tried. They keep their phones on them because we send them pictures and text them regularly to keep them engaged. We also got the other siblings in on it as well. They got life alert first and kept tossing the damn thing into drawers or forgetting to change the batteries, and onstar only works if you still have a car, which they don't because they rolled theirs. Phone's as close as we can get to some form of contact near them.", "I am 60. I have my own plan as well. It was very kind of OP and her husband to provide a phone for the MIL (I recently heard that almost half of adults in their 40s are still on their *parents* plan), and don't understand why that was necessary, *except* that MIL never really wanted a cellphone, and probably did not use it. She ONLY had it because OP and her husband provided it. Since she did not want it, she gave it to someone who did. If MIL wanted a phone, she would have gotten her own.

Of course, that only works if the bill is being split and paid equally by everyone on the plan.", "Yes, but OPs MIL would save by *NOT* having a phone. She does not want it or need it. She only took it because OP and their spouse \"insisted\"."]}
