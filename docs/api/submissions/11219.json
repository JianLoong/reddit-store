Everyone around me says yes, but I feel super gaslighted by my husband\u2019s family right now.  We are both late 20s, no kids.  We added my MIL to our cell plan a few years ago when we got married because she lives alone and didn\u2019t have a cell phone.  My husband thinks it will keep her safer to have one for emergencies.  At the time we added her, for her phone and plan it was around $20 extra per month.  Plan costs have gone up and she got a nicer phone so now it\u2019s close to $50 per month.  Pretty steep, with the way the economy is, am I right?  \n\nAnyway, my husband\u2019s brother has a young kid, he\u2019s 8.  He\u2019s a nice kid, but not my responsibility.  When I called my MILs cellphone a few days ago, my nephew answered.  I asked him if he was at Grandmas house and if I could talk to her.  He said no, he was at his house and Grandma has given him her cellphone to keep because his parents wouldn\u2019t get him one.  \n\nMy MIL didn\u2019t tell me or my husband about this and I got pretty angry.  I\u2019m already not thrilled about paying for HER to have a cellphone, I\u2019m definitely not happy about paying for my 8 yr old nephew to have it!  I went to her house and told her that if she she wasn\u2019t going to use the phone, I was going to take it off our plan and that I wanted the iPhone back from nephew because my husbands screen is cracked and he can have hers.  It will save us a few hundred bucks since we won\u2019t have to buy a new phone.  \n\nNeedless to say, she\u2019s mad now because \u201cit\u2019s her phone to do with as she pleases and she wants nephew to have it\u201d.

If they wanted to keep it to use with wifi, it's murkier. The phone could be considered a gift, the plan is paying for a service she isn't using.\n\n\nBut why did you buy a nice phone? You could buy a dumb phone with minutes or something. What plan do you have where an extra line is $50?", "NTA. It was thoughtful and generous of you to buy a phone and pay for the plan for your MIL in case of emergency.  She was rude and ungrateful to just give it way and expect you to continue paying for it.

It's a leased resource being provided at someone else's cost.  She's not entitled to hand it off to an 8 year old because his parents aren't providing him one.

Regardless, you should not be paying for a plan for your nephew- that\u2019s what parents are for. \n\nMy one suggestion would be to get your MIL one of those cheap Pre-paid simple cell phones that can only make calls and can\u2019t access the internet. Your husband wants her to have it for emergencies, now she has the one feature required in an emergency. If she gives it away then your nephew only has the ability to make calls till the minutes run out, and it costs you nothing. This is also test if they are truly gaslighting you. I suspect nephew, his parents and MIL all are, because they want a free iPhone for the nephew and will complain right away. Your husband might be more angry that you cancelled it with little warning, but if he is still upset when you provide this solution that will show his true feelings. \n\nINFO for all readers: Maybe as a mid-30s DINK (double income no kids) that is, and forever will be, without children by choice I\u2019m out of the loop\u2026.

If they didn't get him one cause they don't want to pay, that settles the reason for why they and MIL are mad. They don't get to freeload off you. Hubby can pay for it if he wants, that's HIS mom. I wouldn't make my wife pay for my mother's phone line, that's ridiculous. \n\nI like the suggestions I've seen with the prepaid phone or landline options. Either one cuts out all the potential bs they might try to pull. I'd go with those if YOU must give MIL a way to communicate for emergencies. Still not your responsibility regardless\n\nNTA, of course", "NTA \nIf you decide to let her back on plan, she can get a flip phone or no internet.", "INFO Why are nephews parent's upset since they didn't allow him to have a cell phone?\n\nWho pays for this phone? Did your husband try to stop you when you said you were canceling it?", "ESH you should have talked to your husband first, MIL shouldn\u2019t have gone behind everyone\u2019s back and given an 8 year old a phone and the mum and dad should be yelling at MIL not you. Don\u2019t make unilateral decisions and not expect them to bite you on the ass.", "NTA.  Whoever pays the bills makes the rules.", "OP is almost 30. I assume/hope the MIL is in her early 50s at least.", "Most people lease or pay in monthly installments for expensive phones like an iPhone.  So the total cost of the phone itself and the service = $50", "My mother in law is on our phone bill, as are my parents. Both sets in their 60s. \n\nThey won't get a cellphone otherwise because they view it as an unnecessary bill. It became an issue we had to force because my mother in law had a heart attack and couldn't reach her landline to call for help and just happened to be rescued by her brother meeting her for lunch within minutes of his happening. My parents got forced into our cellphone plan because my father literally rolled his car and walked 2 miles on a broken leg before he could could reach a business to call for help. \n\nBoth of them are still, despite that, too stubborn to own their own phone plan. $100/month for the sake of our sanity to know they have something if anything happens is worth it.", "> What plan do you have where an extra line is $50?\n\n*At the time we added her, for her phone and plan it was around $20 extra per month. Plan costs have gone up and she got a nicer phone so now it\u2019s close to $50 per month.*\n\nSeems like the plan includes the cost of the phone.", "MIL got an upgrade so the 50 is most likely both the cost of the 3rd line AND the monthly cost of the phone", "Short and sweet!", "Why should OP pay for a cell plan for an 8 yo?", "> At the time we added her, for her phone and plan it was around $20 extra per month.  Plan costs have gone up and she got a nicer phone so now it\u2019s close to $50 per month.\n\nI'm reading between the lines, but it appears the OP and spouse are paying for the plan and the device.", "One of my pet peeves is when someone posts and then does not respond to the first questions that arise.", "\"*Plan costs have gone up and she got a nicer phone so now it\u2019s close to $50 per month*.\"\n\nOP and her husband pay for the phone each month, it's included in the plan costs", "That's what I thought. It's a gift there should be no strings attached and I've seen people on this sub give thousands who had minimal strings and where called ah. \n\nPlus we don't know how the finances work and if there coukd be other reasons she was so annoyed she had yo pay 20 dollars then 50 dollars. \n\nImma have to say YTA OP", "My mom prefers a flip phone, and I have maintained it for years, ever since I realized that Verizon had given her a cheap flip phone and sold her a huge data plan as well.", "> Gramma needs to understand that phones and plans cost money. \n\nYou think she doesn't know?", "We can assume OP did. It doesn't sound like mil needed it so why should she buy it?\n\nThe more interesting question is, when they gave her the phone, did they communicate that the phone is not a gift but a item on loan?", "yup, if you guys paid for the phone as well, absolutely NTA", "No, i don't agree. If you are pissed you are pissed.\n\nI would have also lost my mind, when I see a irresponsible 8yr old playing with an expensive gadget for which I pay 50 buck every month.", "I agree. Not wanting to pay for the phone plan based on what the intention for is completely warranted. However I think going about the way you did might not be the best way. I mean you can do that but you\u2019ll need to accept the consequences (the drama) created by it. Unless that was your intention to begin with", "Maybe they just didn\u2019t want to have to pay for a phone but are happy to have someone else pay for it.", "That would most likely be my assumption as well. Then the only quesion would be whether or not the phone was a gift. A gift for MIL to use that is still being paid for by OP. If MIL gave the phone away (and it was gifted to MIL) should OP be able to take it back from the 3rd party (Nephew)? OP is still paying.\n\nI'm leaning toward it being OK for OP to take the phone back since she is still paying for it. But, I can definitly see both sides.", "Right lol she's a grandma not a dunce", "Hmm, that's true. I'm a firm believer that once a gift is given you can't - usually - take it back. There are a few exceptions when the story is really absurd.\n\nBut cancelling the phone plan is totally up to OP and husband.", "Agreed. I think NTA for cancelling the plan, but if the phone was paid by MIL then AH only for demanding it. If paid by OP and husband, NTA at all", "Bingo."]}
