{"id": 14126, "submission_id": "12dj3vd", "title": "AITA for telling my son to forfeit a wrestling match because he had a female opponent?", "selftext": "My son(17M) is a high school wrestler and he's very good. He has made it to state wrestling championships and placed twice. His mother and I are of course very proud of him. About 2 years ago, they started letting female wrestlers compete against boys in their weight class. There's not very many female wrestlers so this has never been a problem, until the end of this season. The season ended mid March and in one of the first meets that month, my son was set to go against a girl from another high school.\n\nThis kinda sent me into panic mode for two reasons. There is no way for my son to \"win\" here. Let me explain, I don't need for him to win every match, but in this case, no matter how he did in the match he would lose. If he treated her as he does his male competition, he would've dominated. He would be then be known as the kid that slammed a girl who was trying to pioneer her way in a predominantly male sport. He'd be looked at like a bully and he'd end up being a pariah at his school, and doing that would not help him with any of the girls at his school.\n\nThe significantly less likely scenario is that he for some reason held back and lost. Then he'd be the guy that got pinned by a girl publicly in wrestling match. He'd be relentless mocked for that. This was a lose-lose situation for him.\n\nSo before the match I decided to give him some fatherly advice. I explained this situation to him and he confessed to me that he was worried about it himself. I told him that maybe he should just forfeit the match. He said he'd think about it, and he made the decision himself to forfeit before it began.\n\nWe didn't tell his mother about this, and she didn't know until recently. She was told by the mother of another boy on my son's wrestling team and she was pissed. When she asked my son about it, he said that he talked to me about it before he forfeited. I explained to her everything and she was not satisfied. She told our son that him deciding to not wrestle was him effectively saying she was not worthy to compete with him and made her look bad. She told me that my concerns were ridiculous and that what I said is going to give our son bad ideas about women.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680784888, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dj3vd/aita_for_telling_my_son_to_forfeit_a_wrestling/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They give her the same respect as any competitor and wrestle the match. It's not \"social suicide\" at school, it's basically a non event.\n\nIn middle school my boys actually lost on occasion to a girl, again.... The sky didn't fall. They shook hands, and moved on. Literally no one cared. \n\nGranted since puberty, they will win easily against most ( likely not all) girls in their weight classes..... But they are still treated with the same respect as anyone else and wrestle the match. Trust me, she knows what she is getting into and likely understands she will be dominated in the match. But SHE wants to compete, that's HER choice to make. \n\nMy son's highschool team has three girls currently and they train their asses off for the opportunity to compete. Don't deny them that because you want to infantilize them and decide you know better.", "YTA. If she\u2019s in the competition, she knows she might get beat and that this is part of the sport. She made that choice.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re more worried that he might get beat by a girl. You advised him to take the cowardly and sexist way out. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "Come on. He would not be a pariah for beating a girl at a sport in which they both compete. How do you know he would have \u201cdominated\u201d her anyway? And why would he have been RELENTLESSLY MOCKED for losing???There are a lot of assumptions here. \n\nRather than go to your son and pile on all these weird and unfounded worst case scenarios that came straight from a shitty movie script, you should have simply asked him how he was feeling about the situation and let him guide the conversation. \n\nThe only thing you succeeded at doing was passing down your own insecurities and outdated gender beliefs to your kid. I doubt they serve him as well as they may have served you. YTA!", "YTA. I know it's hard to wrap your head around this but it's 2023 and women get to compete in sports and the don't expect anyone to \"take it easy\" on them. I sure hope your son somehow sheds your mysoginistic views once he's out from under your thumb.", "YTA  \n1. She entered fair and square. You diminished that by your actions  \n2. Seems sexist as hell  \n3. You explained it and he did NOT decide on his own. You directly influenced him  \n4. You're perpetuating sexism. If the people in charge thought she was ok to compete it wasn't your business to stop that  \n5. You need to do MUCH better", "YTA.\n\n\nLiterally only people like you think your son would be \"beating on\" a girl if he wins. Literally every sane person says \"oh a girl and a boy wrestled and one of them lost.\" Its a sport. Youre teaching your son she isnt worthy of his time, energy, and attention in a fair and square wrestling match. Do you want to teach him to quit when faced with a woman? Because thats the lesson youre teaching him here.", "YTA\n\nShe is in wrestling. She knows what she is getting into. If she loses, that's on her. He should give it her all.", "JFC.\n\nHow exactly did you think this was going to end?!?! \n\nYTA, of course YTA. Didn't you stop to think that the relevant authorities considered the risks of letting male and female wrestlers compete? What on earth do you think you know that the schools and organisers don't? \n\nAnd by not telling your wife; Was she just supposed to just lose consciousness for several weeks and not wonder why her own damn son didn't take part in the match?\n\nI genuinely cannot comprehend how somebody could take a series of actions as ridiculous as you have, but here we are....", "YTA. It\u2019s a competition for a reason. That probably made her feel worse. He had no reason to forfeit.", "YTA. The competition allows boys AND girls. What\u2019s your plan - he\u2019ll just forfeit every time he is assigned to wrestle against a girl? What a great lesson to teach a kid - give up if you don\u2019t like your competition. He\u2019ll go far in life with that attitude", "YTA, if he wins against her then the best wrestler won, if he loses against her then the best wrestler won. Forfeiting just becuase his oppenent is a girl shows that you don't respect them as a wrestler. You gave your son bad sexist advise.", "YTA. You somehow managed to  encourage both cowardice and misogyny in your child in one move.", "YTA\n\nMy daughter wrestles.  Sometimes against other girls but mostly against boys.  She wins more than she loses.  She doesn't expect anyone to hold back and they don't. Sometimes the boys our weigh her but she has other things on her side like better hip manueverability. \n\nNo one ever mocks boys for losing to girls. No one ever accuses boys of being mean to girls. The vast majority of kids don't over think this. \n\nYou realize males and females compete all the time in PE class? It is pretty normal for co Ed sports to exist in a child's life. Most male wrestlers get over the girl or boy thing super fast and just want to win.  \n\nIt isn't 1950.  Girls aren't playing with a hoop and a stick on one gym while boys swim naked in another gym. Kids are far more chill in today's day and age.", "YTA. Your son is the AH. Your wife was exactly right.", "YTA and unfortunately you have hurt 2 kids with your \"fatherly advice\". You cheapened the sport by having your kid forfeit, and that's sad. So what if a girl might have beaten your son? If he's as good as you say, that would've been a great match to see!", "YTA\n\nAnd how exactly is she supposed to be feel if he were to do that?\nIts exactly as your wife says, its disrespecting beyond belief to her.", "YTA\n\nYour wife is correct. That being said you\u2019re also forgetting this is a highschool sport and those are for fun, this isn\u2019t the pro league. If she lost then she would have lost to someone who placed multiple times- someone I bet many cis boys have lost to. If he lost he would have had a new challenge. I\u2019m assuming no one has a max amount of times they can lose before they\u2019re kicked out? So just let them have fun.", "YTA. She entered the competition to compete fairly. He should have wrestled her like any other opponent. I question the structure too but she signed up to be there, she wants to work on her sport.", "YTA.  While there are legit concerns with the biological differences between cis men and cis women by high school (assuming everyone was cis here, please correct me if I\u2019m wrong) in terms of competing in sports like these, that\u2019s not your call to make- that\u2019s on their parents and on the school.  You were also solely focused on your own son and the reaction to whether he won or not, saying he couldn\u2019t really \u201cwin\u201d- what about his competitor, who wants to compete just as much as your son does but has to deal with people just forfeiting like this (as I\u2019m sure your son is not the first one to do this to her)?  It\u2019s degrading and sexist and isn\u2019t fair, and you\u2019re wrong to encourage your son to forfeit.", "YTA, the girl knew what she signed up for and intended on wrestling with guys. Your son should\u2019ve treated her like any other opponent because thats how she\u2019ll get better. The reasons you listed for forfeiting also just sound like petty high school drama that only happens in the movies. My friends and I wrestled girls in high school and it didn\u2019t make us known as the guys who slammed a girl, a bully, or limit our chances with girls. Nor were we mocked \u201crelentlessly\u201d.", "YTA very clearly.  If your son won no one would be judging him for doing so.  People are aware that wrestling is a physical sport and refusing to treat the female participants the same way is straight up sexist.  Your fears over him 'slamming' her are thus nonsense.  As for if she won?  You're a coward.  A sexist coward.  Maybe your son is God's gift to wrestling and there's not even the smallest chance of her winning, fine, then let her compete and lose.  But if she could have won? Even if only because your son wasn't at the top of his game?  That's how competitive sports work, if you can't get over the possibility that your son might lose to a girl you're an epic tier asshole and should be ashamed for teaching your son to follow that example.", "YTA. You forgot to mention the other very possible outcome that the girl beats your son. \n\nIt\u2019s boys like your son (with his forfeiting) that makes it difficult for females to advance in male dominated sports. Your son is also an AH. He should have gone to his mom for advice instead of you.", "YTA 100% you should have never come in between that kid and his sport and that girls sport. They are competitors that's why they are in the sport to test themselves. How are they supposed to do that when they get interference from outsiders? You're not competing so stay out of it.", "YTA going easy on her for being a girl is more sexist, embarrassing and offensive than your son trying his best and winning.", "YTA Your son should fight her fair and square. I personally think that any 17 year old boy will almost certainly win on over a girl of comparable level. I also would not want my daughter to fight against boys, but that\u2019s not the question here. She decided to give it a try and she deserves your and your son\u2019s respect like any other opponent.", "Yta and contributing to toxic masculinity.", "YTA\n\nI would assume a school's wrestling program would have standards to make sure the students met the criteria to be on the team and be versed enough to start competing. \n\nI would understand if the other student that got paired with your son was newer. But still, that's like telling your son he's so good he doesn't even have to compete against certain people.", "YTA. If the rules say she can compete with boys then your son should wrestle her like he would anyone else.", "You actually chose the only way that your son would really lose. Cause now he just looks like a sexist jerk. Disrespected the girl, the sport, his mother, the school, and the other competitors. It\u2019s 2023 dude. YTA", "Yta", "YTA and so is your district for waiting so long to go coed in wrestling. My daughter wrestled coed in high school and she is over 40. My son wrestled girls and even got his ass handed to him. No one thought less of him. He was nervous about wrestling a girl at first. But there is no way his father or I would\u2019ve allowed him to forfeit. We want our son to respect women as equals, not be afraid of them. \n\nI bet you are that Bubba dad that is trying to live out his imaginary glory days through his son. Your wife is right, deep down you knew you were and that\u2019s why she had to hear about it from someone else.", "YTA 100%. You know who you should have taken those concerns to? Your son's coach, the person who should help prevent him from being seen as a bully for doing his best or for being mocked for holding back. If your son had forfeited 100% on his own that would be different, but saying that you had no influence on him is being in denial.", "YTA. What makes you so sure that your son \u201cwould have dominated\u201d unless he \u201cfor some reason held back and lost?\u201d Have you seen this wrestler compete before?", "YTA His mother is right.", "YTA. Now your kid has a forfeit on his record because he was scared to face a woman. He was scared he'd beat her and scared she'd beat him.", "You are the asshole. Competitive sports are not equal. He should try his hardest against every opponent, regardless of gender.", "YTA - You are projecting your own insecurities and bullshit onto your son. Let him wrestle and deal with your own issues.", "YTA and are contributing to toxic masculinity", "YTA\n\nLet me start saying I\u2019m a feminist. What pisses most women that pioneer male dominated is being treated like lesser of a person, not a colleague, not someone who\u2019s there for their merits. This means that whenever we win fair and square we get labeled \u201cshe just got it because she\u2019s sleeping her way\u201d, \u201che actually let her win\u201d, our wins are never ours alone. This generation is much more aware of these topics than ours so you might have managed to brand your son an insecure sexist, whether it is the truth or not. What you could actually have done was give your son a lesson on empathy and awareness of his situation as a man in our society, you could have taught that it is ok to compete with women if he\u2019s playing fair and would have been ok if after the match he just treated her like an equal having him won or not. For your son\u2019s sake O hope you do better next time.", "YTA. And a sexist one. \u201cHis win would have been tainted\u201d. That\u2019s so much bull. His win would have been a win. He wasn\u2019t bullying some girl in the hall, he was wrestling his opponent. She signed up for that. She wanted to compete. Your wife is 100% correct here. What your son ended up doing was sexist and demeaning. Instead of facing his opponent he forfeited and essentially told her she wasn\u2019t worth competing against. It\u2019s actually the option where he probably lost the most respect from other people.", "YTA. What you did is offensive and goes entirely against the concept of allowing women to compete in male dominated sports.", "Yta, and quite frankly toxic for the way you\u2019re thinking.

Your son is not going to become a pariah for wrestling an opponent who wanted to be part of the competition. I understand the concern, as that was likely what would have happened to you when you were his age, but the world is changing and if his peers are progressive enough to have unisex wrestling, then they\u2019re progressive enough not to ostracize him for treating women with the same respect he shows men. It may even be worse for his reputation if he refuses to fight a girl", "YTA. You disrespected her and her team, and your son's team. He should have wrestled her fairly.

She is a 2nd Dan blackbelt MMA. There are VERY few females at her level and weight. If she wants a sparring session, she has to a spar against a man. There are very few men at her level and weight - most in her weight category are teenage boys who are well below her in fighting technique - even finding a brown belt is hard.\n\nSo she spars against MEN. MEN who weigh a lot more than her. MEN who have been fighting for years. She NEEDS the challenge that these MEN can give her in order to improve. \n\nFighting the females does happen - in arranged events. These tournaments are few and far between. There may be only one or two good FEMALE fighters in a club. So sparring against her equals is just not feasible. And fighting the one and only LOCAL woman at her level, who weighs in at 150lbs, gets boring.\n\nThat female fighter KNEW what she was getting into, and she was looking forward to the challenge. Technique is \u201cwhere it is at\u201d, not muscle strength.

This is discrimination, plain and simple. You excluded someone from an activity based solely on their gender, a legally protected class. This is illegal and very plainly a Title VII case.\n\nYou need to understand that the female who chose to participate in wrestling has been training and getting ready for this match for the opponent to forfeit. He didn't even give her the chance for a challenge. Dude wtf.\n\nGet off your high horse. If she is ready to face the challenge and the risk of defeat, then let her.

There's no shame in beating a trained opponent who shows up within the rules saying they are prepared to compete.  If you dominate them, then so be it, that is for the competitor to learn from and to grow and come back stronger.\n\nThat is the nature of organized sports.  You unleash yourself to perform at your absolute best with no regard for the feelings of the other person (within the rules), you both agree to this upon entering the arena.\n\nTo smugly scoff that, well I would win and I would dominate her so I will forfeit is the opposite of competitive spirit.  Maybe this young lady is out of her depth, or maybe she's a master technician.  If you told me two wrestlers who weighed the same, one was known for their strength the other for their technique and timing, I'd bet on the technician.\n\nThe point is, she has chosen to enter a physical, contact sport to test her skills and accepts the risk as does every other competitor.

How about assuming that she\u2019s a valid competitor in his weight class and he should compete to the best of his ability in a safe and respectful way, same as he should with anyone. \n\nYou should consider how his opponent feels now.

It\u2019s like the debate team or a competition choral group. No one knows and no one cares except the kids that participate. Girls aren\u2019t going to look at him sideways because he wrestled a girl because they aren\u2019t even going to know. Boys aren\u2019t going to judge or mock him because they won\u2019t know. The kids on the team won\u2019t care because they know they might be next. It\u2019s a nonissue until you make it an issue.", "Sounds like you\u2019re not over getting bullied in high school. Has your son been mocked for being to afraid to wrestle a girl? Because that seems like it should be a pretty logical conclusion in your world where high school boys mock and bully each other at every turn.", "Your son\u2019s ego is more important to you than respect for women and girls. Got it. YTA", "Are... are you sure you're qualified to be a teacher? Genuine question.", "it is really nice that you want to protect your son but that doesn\u2019t teach him anything. if you shield him from reality he will be at a loss once he\u2019s living on his own! \n\nalso if he loses and is targeted he can just say that he purposely gave up, pretty believable given the circumstance.", "> I'm a father before I'm a teacher.\n\nSounds like you're bad at both", "Only by sexist people. This would be a non-issue at my kids\u2019 school and we live in a conservative state and area. Maybe stop encouraging a sexist attitude.", "Your insistence on repeating this stance says a lot about you as a person.  You clearly came here just to be \u201cproven\u201d right.  You wanted to be affirmed so you could one-up your wife.  This is yet another aspect of the reason you held your son back.  And that\u2019s what you did; you held him back from an opportunity to grow.\n\nThe fear of life is a bigger problem than the possible \u201cbad\u201d things that might happen.  When you won\u2019t even try, you are telling the world that you are afraid.", "Didn't you say that the girl he was to compete against is on the same weight class as he is? Therefore, shouldn't she be of a reasonably similar size and build to him? And for the record, I knew 17 year old girls in high school who could effortlessly kick my ass. \n\nBut you decided that there was no way your son could help but to slam \"this poor girl\". Be better and please leave your sexist views in the past where they came from. It's 2023", "Huh no. Breaking news, ONLY sexist people like you will see unisex wrestling as bullying. Other normal people will see it as normal competition with a winner and a loser. Not every students even cares about wrestling. As a woman who got out of high school less than ten years ago, i can tell you that the worst bullying i lived was made by guys who though women were inferior in a way or another, which is what you are actively teaching to your son. For having done what is considered a combat sport against men and women, i can assure you that no one gave a fuck when a woman won against a man or vice versa", "So the only way he would be a bully is if he acted like a bully.  If he competes and treats her like a good competitor and shows good sportsmanship, he won\u2019t be taken as a bully, but as someone who respected an opponent\u2019s  abilities enough to not dumb down his own.", "So did you and your son bully and mock the guy that had enough sportsmanship to actually wrestle her?", "Good for her! And good for the next round competitor who treated her like a competitor!", "And what about the girl who is trying to have her wrestling treated  seriously? But her opponent refuses to take her on and forfeits the match?\n\nOr does it not matter because she isn't your child and not your problem?\n\nYour son could of wrestled and aimed to win with the least amount of effort required. Keeping the match close and aiming to win on technique instead of brute force would of given both wrestlers what was needed.", "By giving him advice that will absolutely get him mocked and excluded for being a misogynistic, mra, asshole?  \nTry again.", "Great. Now you\u2019ve set him up to be mocked as \u201cyou\u2019re the guy that was scared to lose to a girl\u201d good going \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "If you taught him that there was nothing wrong with losing to a girl then that would help give him resilience for dealing with any mockery. You don\u2019t get it. You\u2019re the one perpetuating sexism. You also can\u2019t protect him from everything. You need to teach him skills to handle things instead.", "My father and uncles were state champion wrestlers.  My uncle's son has been the high school wrestling coach for the last 10 years and has produced multiple state champions.  He has had female wrestlers during that time and guess what they are treated no different by anyone and some of his girls have winning records. What you're saying says more about you and your community than anything else.....", "165 pounds on a 5'8 teenage boy is different than 165 pounds on a 5'6 teenage girl", "I'm not going to set my son on fire to make sure this girl can be warm. She got a chance to compete the next round", "Or being mocked as The Guy Whose Daddy Made Him Forfeit To A Girl.", "I'm sure everyone who was ever bullied was taught that there wasn't anything wrong with them and the bullies were wrong. \n\nDo you genuinely think that helps? If so I have a bridge to sell you", "And 165 pounds on a 5'6 boy with a stockier build is different than 165 pounds on a 5'10 boy with a lankier build. And they're still allowed to compete against each other. \n\nNewsflash: people are built differently and they are still treated fairly and given the equal chance to compete.", "Are you really reading all these responses telling you that you were wrong and just choosing to be dense? If you feel that strongly he would be bullied in this case then maybe you shouldn\u2019t have him in wrestling.", "Your son is supposedly a really good wrestler. Who is actually going to bully him, that he can't easily defend him against / end the bullying?"]}
