My mom's boyfriend (M51) has lived with us since I was 7. \n\nRecently my mom's boyfriend has been in jail, and while he was in jail, I reported him for sexual and physical abuse. My mom did not believe me, and she has brought him back into the house numerous times despite all of our family members (not counting my two brothers), friends, and therapists telling her not to. \n \nHe has called me, texted me, etc with threats since then. \n\nTwo days ago, I was sitting in my room watching TV when I heard her boyfriend coming up the stairs and my mom yelling at him not to come in my room. Despite this, he still tried to walk in, and in retaliation, I hit him upside the head with a rollerskate. My sister, friends, and other family members have told me I wasn't in the wrong for this, and he shouldn't have come in my room, but my mom and my brothers have told me that I shouldn't have done it.  I understand that physical violence wasn't exactly the best route to take, which is why I'm asking here.
