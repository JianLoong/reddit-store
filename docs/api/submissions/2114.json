Everything has to be done her way..\nShe makes my anxiety go through the roof, because even though I am a very honest and straightforward person, I don\u2019t like it when people are mad at me, so in the past I tended to just go with whatever she does. She continuously buys us things we explicitly said we don\u2019t want (not our taste - like house decorations) and then expects us to use it.\nSince we got married she has been really needy with us. \n(For a bit of background, she loves my husband maybe a little too much and he has never been able to say no to her.

Yes, we do need to work through it and learn to handle things as a team, but to defend him a little bit: She doesn't accept the word NO.. so he just feels like she isn't going to change no matter what.. So I am basically told there is no solution, which is what angers me. I guess I am looking for answers on how to set boundaries with someone that most likely won't accept them..\nEDIT 2: My husband's main concern with me saying something to her is that I am not a very bubbly person, to be more blunt, I have resting bitch face. He is concerned that she will focus on my face and not my words and feel like I hate her.. not a reason not to do it for me though!", "created_utc": 1668257458, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yt67d1/aita_for_wanting_to_set_boundaries_with_my_mil/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In fact I'm sure it will only get worse once you have kids. \n\nPeople who enable narcissists with statements like \"that's just who she is\" are a real part of the problem. Your husband is supposed to put YOU first now, not his mommy. To be honest, I personally couldn't respect anyone who puts his mommy before me in a relationship.

If she wants calls every day he has to do it . If he wants them over he can do all the hosting.\n\nI know it is strange that he can't say no because he knows his parents would not say no to him . They are a family which can count on each other .\n\nI personally would ask her about her own MIL and even own mother and see what she thinks about them and what problem her MIL and Mother caused in her marriage maybe then she can reflect on her own behaviour .\n\nThere are only 2 options  either you get confortable with this new lifestyle or you srt boundries .", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But stop pretending that thisis a MIL issue.

You are expected to call her every day when you have kids?!!?!?! Does she say it? Does your husband say it? Does she say it and he says nothing about it? You need to set boundaries now!!!! It's kind of already late. Stop giving in otherwise she will never stop. Also, your husband is part of the problem, you need to set boundaries together with him for his mum.
