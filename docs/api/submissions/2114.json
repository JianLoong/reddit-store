She is really sweet and would do anything for us, but also very disrespectful of other people\u2019s feelings if that\u2019s not how she feels about it. Everything has to be done her way..\nShe makes my anxiety go through the roof, because even though I am a very honest and straightforward person, I don\u2019t like it when people are mad at me, so in the past I tended to just go with whatever she does. She continuously buys us things we explicitly said we don\u2019t want (not our taste - like house decorations) and then expects us to use it.\nSince we got married she has been really needy with us. \n(For a bit of background, she loves my husband maybe a little too much and he has never been able to say no to her.

EVERY DAY! With their kids. \n\nR is already upset with me because I don\u2019t call her every day. I just know I am not that person as I don\u2019t even talk to my own family that much, but have been told more than once that that is what will be expected of me when I have kids. Also that my mother in law can visit the kids whenever she wants.\n\nI honestly feel that she runs my house and it is driving me mad, but I am just not allowed to say anything because my husband is afraid I will ruin his relationship with her.

Yes, we do need to work through it and learn to handle things as a team, but to defend him a little bit: She doesn't accept the word NO.. so he just feels like she isn't going to change no matter what.. So I am basically told there is no solution, which is what angers me. I guess I am looking for answers on how to set boundaries with someone that most likely won't accept them..\nEDIT 2: My husband's main concern with me saying something to her is that I am not a very bubbly person, to be more blunt, I have resting bitch face. He is concerned that she will focus on my face and not my words and feel like I hate her.. not a reason not to do it for me though!", "created_utc": 1668257458, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yt67d1/aita_for_wanting_to_set_boundaries_with_my_mil/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Until he chooses to stop being controlled by mommy you're screwed.", "You are NTA for setting boundaries, your husband is TA for not enforcing them together with you. I'd really think about if you want to have kids with this man, especially when MIL's demands about seeing your children anytime she wants etc. are already laid out.\n\nIt will likely not get better, only harder for you to exit this situation. As some other commenters have already suggested, marriage counseling could be an option, if your husband has at least some motivation to put boundaries down.", "NTA.  Your husband expects you to call your MIL every day? Does your BIL do that? This is all very weird.  It sounds like you\u2019re MIL hasn\u2019t accepted that her children are grown adults with lives of their own now.  Boundaries are healthy.  Basically having a third person in your life is not healthy.  You\u2019re a newlywed. It\u2019s going to get worse.  Let me encourage you to find professional help now, via marriage counseling.", "My SO tried to pull the \u201cthat\u2019s just how they are\u201d explanation with regards to my being more introverted than his family and them not liking it . My response was \u201cAnd this is just how I am. What are your mother and sisters doing to change their behavior to accommodate me, or am I the only one expected to change my entire personality in order to make them more comfortable?\u201d\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t even call my own mother every day, and we have an amazing relationship. The idea that I\u2019d call my MIL daily is just bizarre. NTA", "NTA. You need marriage counseling asap, especially before you have kids.

However, marriage counseling might benefit you and husband in helpingl him lay down his own boundaries.  NTA", "NTA. Clear boundaries are healthy to have and everyone ends up happier when they\u2019re respected. You have to be comfortable in your own home and not let her run your house because of her expectations.\n\nYou married your husband, not his mom.", "NTA. I strongly suggest that you hold off on the having kids things until you have solved this to your satisfaction. Counseling might help your husband set boundaries. But if that doesn't work - don't have kids.", "NTA but you have more of a husband problem than a MIL problem", "You need to sit down with a marriage counsellor so there is someone uninvolved to direct and redirect the conversation and then put down boundaries. Now. Before there are kids. Just in case.", "NTA at all but you need to think very carefully about your future. Your husband doesn't have your back and is enabling his mother (who sounds like a narcissist!). Nothing is going to change for the better as long as this keeps happening. In fact I'm sure it will only get worse once you have kids. \n\nPeople who enable narcissists with statements like \"that's just who she is\" are a real part of the problem. Your husband is supposed to put YOU first now, not his mommy. To be honest, I personally couldn't respect anyone who puts his mommy before me in a relationship. You would have to include him anytime someone asks how many children you have. Best of luck to you, OP, you deserve to feel happy and safe with your partner. I wish you all the best.", "WOW that's sad!\n\nI get it that you both grew up in different Environments so her behaviour becomes normal to him . So because he lived this way for years it does bother him less it is his norm and he can't really see your view on it because it is simple what he knows is normal.\n\nNormally the rule is that every partner sets boundries with their own family.\n\nBut in your case he won't do it. If she wants calls every day he has to do it . If he wants them over he can do all the hosting.\n\nI know it is strange that he can't say no because he knows his parents would not say no to him . They are a family which can count on each other .\n\nI personally would ask her about her own MIL and even own mother and see what she thinks about them and what problem her MIL and Mother caused in her marriage maybe then she can reflect on her own behaviour .\n\nThere are only 2 options  either you get confortable with this new lifestyle or you srt boundries .", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But stop pretending that thisis a MIL issue.

That\u2019s his choice, but you don\u2019t have to go.\n\nThey come visit without your prior consent? Fine, but your husband has to handle it.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to continue to argue with your husband. You start living by your boundaries, and he\u2019ll catch on. His mom runs the show bc everyone lets her. Telling her no won\u2019t ruin anything.", "NTA.  Your MIL needs to learn what boundaries are and how to respect them.  Unfortunately, 1st you need to teach your husband and then both of you need to teach MIL about boundaries and enforce them.  This is no easy.\n\nFYI: my parents live next door and I don't talk to either of them everyday.  It can be done ;-)", "OMG NTA but girl sorry wake up!!! You are expected to call her every day when you have kids?!!?!?! Does she say it? Does your husband say it? Does she say it and he says nothing about it? You need to set boundaries now!!!! It's kind of already late. Stop giving in otherwise she will never stop. Also, your husband is part of the problem, you need to set boundaries together with him for his mum. Your husband sounds like a Mama's boy in a bad way. He allows all those things and puts her before you.
