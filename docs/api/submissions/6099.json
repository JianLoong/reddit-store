He's made it clear he has one father and isn't interested in having a relationship with me be it bad or good he just doesn't care at all. He's one of the weirdest kids I'd ever met.\n\n\nAfter selling the land I inherited from my dad, my wife managed to convince me to start a college fund for Ricky. I wasn't sure of it til I noticed how he'd sometimes \"tolerate me\" just because of it. So I went ahead and opened that fund and started adding money to it here and there. We still get into a lot of arguments but at least he'd say sorry sometimes.\n\n\nAt christmas I was excited when I found out that he cared enough to get me a gift. All went well til I opened it. Turns out he took a picture of his middle finger, printed it out and folded it and put it in a box and decorated the box with decorative paper. I was floored. Especially when he began laughing along with some of my inlaws. I was pissed I asked if he would still find it funny if I decide to cancel his college fund because of what he did. His response was this \"what you thought? respect is earned not bought a**hole!\" I replied with \"okay, then spending money on you is obviously useless so I won't even bother...\" then I announced infront of everyone that I had officially canceled his college fund. His mom freaked out and he got up and stormed off. A huge argument ensued and I was told I was wrong for reacting this way and for making a hasty decision over what my wife called \"fun prank\". Given Ricky's response this was not a prank.\n\n\nAfter christmas was ruined. My wife started arguing saying I'm taking the extreme route and warned me about further and permenant damage in my relationship with Ricky. She says he still wants the fund although he's acting like he doesn't care and is pressuring me to reconsider but I said I won't.\n\n\nAITA?

Did his mother insist that you two have a father-son relationship?  It sounds like there was some strong-arming going on. \n\nHis Christmas gift was an extreme reaction, but maybe you and/or his mother ignored some warning signs and/or behaved in ways that stirred the resentment.

HE is the one who \u201cFURTHER RUINED\u201d the relationship with you two. \nYou\u2019re wife is completely out of line to tolerate that disrespect and hatred towards you. It wasn\u2019t a prank.

End of story.\n\nAs for the asshole part, no, you're not the asshole and neither is he. It was your good intention to start the fund in the first place.

Acting like its only his money.", "Hold the phone.  Your wife is a stay at home to a 16 year old\u2026 and she still raised him to be an asshole?\n\nOP, you\u2019re NTA. Your wife and her son are.  And given that she is ok with the lack of respect he treats you with, and expects you to pay for his education\u2026 I would reconsider your relationship with HER.", "You are so NTA. Little sod fucked around and found out. Some kids, despite what others think, are arseholes.", "Even if the money came not through work, she\u2019s not entitled to any of it. An inheritance from your side of the family wouldn\u2019t automatically flow to her or her son.  \n\nAgree with the other comments, you have no obligation to fund your stepson\u2019s college fund out of YOUR inheritance esp. when he treats you like a big bag of s****.", "Guess its time for your wife to get a job to pay for her kid's college.", "Wow. Absolutely nope! \n\nAre there any other kids? Because at his age he doesn\u2019t need a stay at home mom. And if you are providing for the whole family you should be treated with respect. Not like a cash cow. \n\nI\u2019d be re-evaluating my \u2018family\u2019 in your shoes.", "Buddy, I couldn't make you a red flag bigger than that. Come on, man.", "Yeah, probably is, but that doesn\u2019t make it the Step-Dad\u2019s issue.", "Well, next year, they can all chip in a few hundred dollars to help replace the college fund, right? Nope, they won't do that, even though THEY ARE family.", "You are absolutely right.", "Wow as someone with a child born during covid I can say we do but hey \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f like you said not everyone in a fortunate position!\n\nBut the kid shouldn\u2019t be rude to someone giving him a opportunity \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
