YTA. Let me explain.\n\nPeople have different reasons to be quiet. While you prefer it not everyone is like that. Some people are shy, have self esteem issues or other problems. You did now know what intentions our coworkers has to ask you, you had no reason to think they were malicious. Yet you assumed it was an accusation and answered rudely. You did not own friendship or explanation to your coworker, but FFS, how hard is it to assume they were friendly, smile, politely say \"I just prefer it this way\" instead of creating tension at your workplace?", "YTA. You are an adult, use your words. It\u2019s just as easy to say \u201cthat\u2019s rude to ask\u201d as it is to be an asshole, like you were. It could have been a teaching opportunity for someone who didn\u2019t realize what he said was wrong, but you reinforced the idea that quiet people have something \u201cwrong\u201d with them.", "As a 40 year old fellow \u201cquiet person\u201d I get it- I\u2019m exhausted/baffled by the question. But soft YTA for your reaction, you kinda snapped and it was his first time asking, if he\u2019d been pestering you that would be one thing, but he might not have meant it badly.", "YTA. You might be tired of that question, but it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s asking. He might not even be aware of others asking you all the time. \n\nIt was more of an attempt to start a conversation, not an accusation.", "YTA for how you treated you coworker. That being said I do understand your frustration with the situation and how your introversion is received by other people. if you want to apologize to your coworker you can tell him that you prefer being alone and that it bothers you when people find it weird or wrong and that it wasn\u2019t ok to take it out on him like that. You may or may not care, but maybe he thought you had a hard time talking to people and wanted to approach you, which maybe he shouldn\u2019t have done during your lunch break. Over all I\u2019d say not to take it so personally! It seems like that question is a sore spot for you", "YTA, and yes you need to apologize. If you don't this guy is going to think you hate him which creates an uncomfortable work environment. Blowing up like that is unprofessional and can give other people a bad impression of you.", "I feel you in that situation, I really do. Quiet and reserved people are made to feel \"wrong,\" \"lesser\" etc when really, the world wouldn't work if every single person was a loudmouth.\n\nWhat you said was rude, yes. There were better ways to respond. What he said was also rude.\n\nESH, you should apologize. But if I were you, I'd use this as a chance to let the guy know what he said was rude too.", "In this situation YTA, \nNoone wants their Head bitten of for trying to make conversation. I get why you get annoyed by that type of question, because apparently it is not socially acceptable to be quite among groups of people. But you need to be respectfull about other people as well.", "YTA. Look, dude, I despise small talk too but heres a tip, When you first get to a new job, socialize a little and make it known you just really don't like small talk. Be friendly, be polite. After a couple of weeks people will know your pace and self adjust. They will know your social barriers. A little bit of work goes a long way towards people leaving you the fuck alone.", "A very gentle and soft, YTA but only based on snapping at a coworker, unless he was all \"Hey, look at the quiet freak over here\" type of way.\n\nBut your experience made me think - generally people feel OK to ask \"Why are you so quiet?\" or \"How do you stay so skinny?\" yet if it was reversed as \"Why are you so loud?\" or \"Why are you so fat?\" then boy howdy that is just not be acceptable.", "This is kind of an ESH situation, first it\u2019s none of your coworkers business, it just isn\u2019t, secondly you could\u2019ve calmly told him your situation like \u201clook man, I\u2019m very uncomfortable, with small talk\u201c I do think your coworker deserves an apology though.", "Kinda ESH but honestly speaking from experience, all the polite replies people in the comments are saying you should have used? Yeah they don\u2019t work. \n\nThe kind of person who asks you why you\u2019re quiet isn\u2019t the kind of person who will accept a polite response. They\u2019ll just keep on harping on like a kid asking their mom why over and over again. \n\nSometimes you have to be a bit of an AH to get people to accept you are the way you are. And I bet if you go back to apologise he\u2019ll start going on about how he can help bring you out of you shell or something", "YTA. Your coworker didn't do much to set you off.\n\nSure these kind of questions are usually very intrusive and annoying, if they are meant in condescending way of the person keeps pushing the topic after you said it's not something to worry about. The way you describe it it sounds like a clunky attempt to make contact with you. He's not in the wrong for trying once, you're not in the wrong for declining. Snapping at him right off the bat is pretty unhinged though.", "YTA. Yes you should apologize. I\u2019m quiet too. I have coworkers tell me that all the time. And sometimes it opens conversations with them which is fine. \n\nNow your coworker thinks you\u2019re probably quiet because you don\u2019t have anything nice to say. You don\u2019t need to explain anything to him. He doesn\u2019t need a life story but the coworker didn\u2019t deserve that reaction from you.", "A small YTA .\nYour reply would be ok or even funny among friends and family at times.\nYou can talking to him and do a small apology. Better not to have bad blood at workplace unnecessary.", "YTA The man asked you an innocent question. How was he supposed to know that you've been asked that same question so many times before and was tired of it? You should apologize.", "NTA. \n\nWild to me that everyone views \u201cwhy are you so quiet\u201d as an ok question but \u201cwhy are you so loud\u201d as rude.", "NTA, but if you feel like your coworker needs the apology you should apologise. Or maybe just let him know that you\u2019re not much for chit chat in general, then at least he won\u2019t keep trying. \nI completely understand where you\u2019re coming from though. It\u2019s very frustrating to have to justify your quiet nature when other people have a problem with it.", "NTA. What your coworker said was rude and insulting. It is never ok to ask \"why are you so quiet?\" And it's especially hostile to do it to a coworker. I don't blame you for snapping. I guess if you wanted the same deniability you could've asked \"why are you so loud?\" It sucks that people expect you to just sit back and take insults.\n\nThey are just projecting their insecurity onto you. Your comfort with silence and not talking makes them feel threatened. It's totally their issue.", "NTA I think attacking back when you\u2019re attacked is an excellent strategy.\n\nIt\u2019s not overly accepted in American culture, but I think it\u2019s very effective", "NTA at all. This would be extremely frustrating. You weren't the rude one here.", "Yeah, there no call for your behavior in work place.  \nYou may need some mental help.   Think about it.", "YTA you were the one unnecessarily rude here.", "ESH.I get you. I am an introvert and have the same problem. In a group setting I am the quiet one and got asked about it a lot of times. But you can still be respectful when someone asks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At first Ford formed a theory to account for this human behaviour. If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths seize up. After a few months' consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one. If they don't keep on excercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working.\n\nDouglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", "NTA!\nhe was very rude with how he asked you the question. ive seen people get too comfortable being that way towards us quiet people. Time we put our foot down. Last time someone asked me why im so quiet i said because i didnt want to talk to them \ud83d\ude02 its really not something you should ask someone. The equivalent really is if we were to ask \"why do you talk so much?\" to these people. And i guess if the shoe fits, they really shouldnt be offended by what you said either if what they said 'wasnt bad'. Because again, its essentially the equivalent and based on his original question i would feel like he'd be able to joke about it at least or be like \"you got me there haha\"", "NTA. I really disagree with everyone saying YTA. How was he not intrusive? Since when is it ok to ask that kind of stuff... It was clearly not a positive thing in his mind when he asked. It's also incredibly stupid to ask that as it's likely going to make the person more quiet?", "ESH I think his question was overstepping. He realized you never say anything. Did he really thought this way of questioning is the right way? \n\nBut yeah, your reaction was over the top. I can understand that you got pissed off. I'm autistic and also quiet like a rock around most people i don't feel comfortable with, especially in groups. I heard this so often. What do they want as a reaction? \"What? no! I talk all the time! You can't hear it? Get your ears checked out.\"  Yes, i'm quiet, good observation, here is your gold star. But at best you don't let them get to you. Look them in the eyes and then just say \"Yes.\" I think this is the best way since they want to start a conversation with you and you don't give it to them with a simple yes. \n\nWhen you feel the next time that such a question makes you angry, take a deep breath. At least for me it works to breath the impulse reaction away.", "This is a very gentle but poignant YTA. You have every right to not want to engage in small talk and be left to your own devices, but communicating that with people who are inquisitive is important in order to garner respect. No one can read your mind, so you have to be the one to make your boundaries known to others. You're not a bad person, and I'm sure getting the question over and over is frustrating, but you still are accountable for your actions (and I'm sure you know that).", "There is no reason for a coworker to ask that question. That alone shows their intentions aren't pure.", "Yeah I probably didn\u2019t help how he views me", "Yeah it\u2019s my brain automatically assuming that it\u2019s an accusation based on past experiences. I took it the wrong way without knowing what his intentions were", "Fair enough. If anything I only reinforced the belief that quiet people have something wrong with them", "Right!", "Dude was trying to small talk. He left him alone when he was clearly denied, how does that make him suck? For trying to be polite?", "The intention could have been to try to include OP into the team. Some teams have a nice dynamic going on. Co-worker might have thought something makes OP feel uncomfortable. I don't think those wouldn't be pure intentions. People cannot read your mind. Communication is key in creating understanding for each other.", "To me, it sounds as if his intentions were to figure out whether there is something that makes you uncomfortable and to include you in the team. He showed interest in you as a person. If he wouldn't care, he wouldn't try to figure out why you are not talking. Thus, your reaction makes YTA. It wasn't called for.", "Dont beat yourself up. It happens. Buy him a little token of appreciation. A beer, or whatever, and appologize and tell him you just had a bad moment. Then it Will pass i am sure.", "Yeah\u2026 I think he might just have a bad impression on you specifically. I doubt he\u2019ll hold that over every quiet person he meets.", "Yes he had good intentions but in my opinion its pretty rude to ask someone such a personal question. There are other ways to make small talk without putting the other person in the spotlight.", "Yeah I\u2019ll give him an apology the next time I see the guy. I didn\u2019t have to be hostile, even if I was annoyed I could\u2019ve just answered the question", "Yeah, NTA. \n\nAnd for everyone who\u2019s saying otherwise, think about what you\u2019d say if someone randomly walked up to a naturally chatty person and said \u201cwhy are you so loud man? You never shut up!\u201d. I can guarantee almost no one would say that that person was NTA, or that they didn\u2019t deserve an impolite response. \n\nThis is no different. Just because someone is quiet doesn\u2019t mean you get to give them a hard time or treat them with disrespect.", "YTA but lightly, it\u2019s not a character judgment off one thing.\n\nI get quiet people hate hearing that. What it means though is not an accusation etc. - just an olive branch to indicate the other person is interested in talking to you, maybe hearing anything you\u2019d want to share - they\u2019d like to know you or start a conversation and they feel uncomfortable and are trying to bring it up awkwardly. I think quiet people miss that us loud people are awkward af lol and it\u2019s not said with certainty like we judging your quiet. I actually wish I\u2019d shut up lol\n\nIt\u2019s fine to say \u2018 I just prefer my music.\u2019 Or \u2018I don\u2019t have much to say\u2019 or whatever you want, simple as \u2018just how I am\u2019. You were unnecessarily rude, that\u2019s not being quiet it\u2019s being grouchy. The accusation feeling etc. is how you took it, you didn\u2019t have to be rude. \n\nI do think many people are quiet cause they don\u2019t know how else to be and it\u2019s easier. I have many quiet friends cause they find it easy with me I guess - I can start convos and so on, less pressure on them. And I somehow end up being someone they can talk to. \n\nSome quiet people will be repelled by me too, quick, cause on first instance they\u2019d just see a loud person maybe etc. I had a colleague who told me a year in that he eventually had to acknowledge my greetings were real, I wait for an answer, and didn\u2019t change - so he got close to me despite being grouchy and antisocial with everyone else (he was longest at the company too). It took him a year to actually engage with me and eventually share that resistance he has. It\u2019s funny cause every colleague told me how they tried so many social activities and such to engage him, everyone likes the guy. I just said hi, asked how he is before talking shop, listened and offered solutions to his concerns (he was a grouch and said no to a lot lol), and the only social thing was chatting when we grab coffee. It was sad that he had so many better friends waiting all the years, and stayed lonely because I don\u2019t know why. It was nice being his friend, and I just hope he learned to just engage cause all our other colleagues were genuine and more fun than I lol.\n\nAll to say, give people and yourself a chance. I\u2019d apologies lightly \u2018bro, you caught me at a bad moment with a random question sorry about the other day. I\u2019m generally quiet man, if you have something to say just tap me on the shoulder cause I mostly have music on.\u2019 Or let them know if/when to talk to you etc. Set your boundaries, don\u2019t be rude. All it took for my colleague was telling me he thought I was a fake ass peppy annoyance until he saw consistency and genuineness a year later. Anyway sorry to over share haha", "NTA,\n\nI feel like the other employee asked \u201cwhy are you so quiet \u201c in a rude manner and I would probably respond the same way you did. \n\nPeople pick on quiet people because they think they have a soft shell and won\u2019t get any retaliation and they are often offended when the quiet person defends themselves because the conversation didn\u2019t go as they planned .", "NTA, omg. That question is one of the *many* reasons I'm never going back to work in person. I hardcore disagree with everyone in the comments suggesting you give some kind of \"gentler\" or more \"polite\" answer; it literally never works. If you tell someone \"I just don't like small talk\" they laugh at you and say \"Oh, why?\" or they keep pressing you to make it with them. I can't stand that \"Why are you so quiet\" question, it's *so* rude. Being rude back to him got him to back off and leave you alone, so it worked -- and I don't even necessarily think you were rude to him, honestly. He wasn't \"just\" asking a question, he was being nosy. \n\nWhy on earth do the quiet people always have to give an excuse as to why we're quiet, anyway? Maybe more \"loud\" people *should* be asked why they're so talkative.", "YTA. There are certain social mores in this world that are just expected in a workplace. One of them is to interact well with your coworkers. As a fellow introvert, I get you'd rather sit with your headphones on and isolate yourself. I know small talk is hard and there are plenty of things you'd rather be doing than making nice with your colleagues.\n\nHowever if you ever want to get ahead in this world, being seen as a teamplayer, a friendly, approachable and collaborative person speaks volumes. You don't have to be friends with everyone you work with, or anyone, but being friendly costs you nothing.\n\nVery few jobs operate in a vacuum and being seen as easy to deal with is pretty imperative. As someone who is quiet myself, I have had that question directed at me too. I usually just smile and say 'I'm just not much of a talker', or 'sometimes I just need a bit of quiet time' in a pleasant, friendly way.", "YTA. If you're going to work in a social setting, you at least have to be polite to your coworkers. You don't have to like them or be best friends but you're being rude by ignoring everyone and then getting mad at your coworker for asking a simple question.", "As a fellow quiet person, can you lend some of your energy to me? I can't confront people even when they make me mad. My coworkers, one in particular is always up my butts. He always tries to make small talks, little jokes, you know, standard coworker things. The problem is I find his small talk really intrusive and his sense of humor horrible, borderline offensive. For months, I have been trying to tell him to shut the fuck off, I just can't. I always reply with some passive aggressive sarcastic lines which I don't think he gets.\n\nAnyway sorry for the rant. I will go with NTA here, because I totally get your frustration. And with this little unnecessary outburst, you may have saved yourself from a lot of future annoying conversations. I wish I did something like you did when I started here, so I never became friendly with that guy in the first place.\n\nEdit: Typo", "NTA in my opinion. You're naturally quiet, he's naturally loud. Really winds me up how people can't accept that not everyone is just like them.", "NTA - you matched his energy IMO. Don't let him gaslight you into thinking he was asking from a place of kindness.", "YTA.  You don't have to be rude to set boundaries.  Just say \"I'm quite introverted and like to be left to myself, mostly.\"  Then smile and turn away.", "NTA, \"why are you so quiet?\" Is not a genuine attempt at conversation. They were goading you.", "I would suggest apologizing to your coworker for blowing up at them and explaining, that they hit a nerve, because you have been asked this a lot in the past.\n\nNo need to seem like a bitch with someone you have to spend time with for 8 hours 5 days a week and can make your life a living hell...", "NTA, you weren't rude, you made the same point back to him, you're quiet because it's who you are, he's loud because it's who he is. He then over reacted saying yo it was just a question, being defensive. You asked if there was a problem and he stropped off like a child.", "NTA. I\u2019m the talkative coworker but I would never go out of my way to make a quiet coworker pay attention to me. It\u2019s obvious your lack of response wasn\u2019t out of character for you, other people just feel frustrated. Especially depending on the environment. For example, in retail the only joy (read: basic humanity) one can find sometimes is in coworkers.", "YTA. I\u2019m also a quiet person but I don\u2019t pride myself in being rude to coworkers. No one likes small talks but we don\u2019t act like animals to well meaning people who don\u2019t get our implication. You could have said that\u2019s just how I am even at home and they would have said oh okay.", "ESH, your coworker's question seems tactless and needlessly confrontational to me, but snapping at him wasn't worth it.", "YTA  this considerate man was asking you if youre okay and you made them regret talking to you again", "ESH but you do owe an apology. Its a rude question and could have been phrased much better, and your answer wasn't even that bad as a way to reframe it. However you assumed their intentions and he wasn't pestering you over and over, you frustration isn't the guy's fault. \n\nYou can even explain why you got annoyed. \"Hey, I'm sorry for snapping you before. People ask me that all the time and it really pisses me off becuase its like I'm being asked to justify myself. I don't like small talk so I don't participate in it, that's all.\" And just leave it at that. If he tries to carry on the conversation then you can continue it or you can just end the conversation and go about your day, whichever you prefer in the moment.", "Maybe he was concerned for your welfare giving you a chance to share a problem.", "Yta", "NAH. I don't know your job and job culture, but my dad is a very quiet person too and was/is a welder. He thought it was a great job because you didn't need to have chitchat, you can just listen to the news and music and work your butt off and no need to socialise, other than the project specs. However, in theory that is true, but in reality, other colleagues didn't like how he got the workload for a week done in a day and a half, thought he was weird for not wanting to chitchat, and they created a hostile environment. That happened a few times, and resulted in him getting fired first every time there was a reorganisation, bosses wanted to keep him for the work done but team wouldn't want to continue with him, so he gets voted off. I would suggest to sometimes get out of your comfort zone and make some effort to do get to know your colleagues a bit.", "YTA. Maybe you should look into anger management classes. This response isn\u2019t normal. A lot of people get asked the same question over and over and don\u2019t respond like this. It\u2019s annoying but this response is disproportional to the question. This is probably fake but still", "From zero to mad dog in 6 seconds. It's always the quiet ones you have to look out for. ESH, question was rude, your response was aggressive and rude.", "People ask that to me too. Sometimes I just smile and avoid answering . Maybe he was worried about you? Maybe he wanted to know more about you? If you dont want to answer just change the topic. Dont get mad unnecessarily", "ESH.  If the question was posed the same as you quoted it, then it's a pretty tactless way to ask.  Your response was unnecessarily aggressive as well.  Just my 2\u00a2.", "I'm like you. Find a job where you can work remote.\nThat's what I've been doing for years now. Not having to interact with other humans at work is blissful.", "I had someone come up to me while working, on my 2nd or 3rd day solo once, asking why I looked so unapproachable with my pissed off and/or resting bitch face.\n\nDeadpan looked at her and replied \"and yet here you are\"\n\nWe laughed about it. \n\nTakeaway here, some people **look** like you need to leave them alone. Some people actually **need** to be left alone. Just don't be a jerk about it. Make a joke, you'll be better off.", "NAH. You are overthinking things.", "Kind of sounds like you're an asshole usually, it just came out this time where someone could hear it.", "Some assholes should just remain quiet because they're antisocial.", "Yta, and you should really think about changing it. I get not liking small talk, but networking and being pleasant is part of work life. At least make an effort to be personable while you are being paid for your time. You don't have to take em home , and you don't have to be their best friends, but you do need to form a working relationship.", "You got issues kid, not for being quiet either. Therapy asap. You seem to fly off the handle purely by imagined slights and past experiences.\n\n\nWhat fault did your coworker have in you being bullied in the past?\n\n\nYTA", "YTA. I\u2019m guessing this gives coworkers yet another reason confirmed that you\u2019re an asshole they won\u2019t want to talk to", ">\"I feel like I was unnecessarily rude here.\"\n\nWell, there you go. What do you need us for?", "NTA although your response was a bit over the top. Why you are an introvert is not something you need to justify. Anyone with a modicum of emotional intelligence would know that \u201cwhy are you always so quiet\u201d comes across judgemental and would make the majority of introverted people feel really uncomfortable. The subtext of his comment was \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with you\u201d, which is rude and invasive, and probably you snapped after years of feeling out of place in an extrovert world. I\u2019m surprised at how many people here feel like he was just asking an innocuous question.", "YTA. He was trying to get to k ow you and you were rude for no reason.", "Nta. No one is really an AH here. I'd say ESH but I don't think anyone was out of line really.", "It seemed like he genuinely wanted to check up on you?? YTA", "Thanks, appreciate the response. And you\u2019re right, I could\u2019ve easily given a normal answer and the conversation likely wouldn\u2019t have lasted much longer anyway. I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m gonna apologize to him the next time I see him. Nothing over the top just a \u201csorry about what I said earlier man I was having a bad day\u201d or something like that.", "Lol that reminds me of when my now ex MIL, who was CONSTANTLY having digs at me, announced that \u2018it\u2019s funny that you\u2019re a baker when you\u2019re so skinny\u2019 (yeah, who\u2019d\u2019ve thought that running around essentially in a sauna all day would make you skinny) and I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore and said yeah?  Like how it\u2019s funny that you like running when you\u2019re so fat?  You could\u2019ve heard a pin drop", "I was thinking the exact same thing. You can never ask someone why they're so fat but it's a-okay to ask why they're quiet. I find it rude and insulting and don't blame OP for snapping. Still can't snap at a coworker though, even though they fully deserved it. ESH.", "Now now.  He went on to explain why their brains working would be a bad thing.  \ud83d\ude0a", "\"Why are you so quiet\" isn't a conversation starter, it's an insult.", "He was not rude at all. All he was trying to do is make conversation and I have found that any time someone has asked anyone that it is out of concern for their mental health or they just are genuinely curious. There is nothing wrong with what the coworker said op severely overreacted", "\u201cWhy are you so loud\u201d is only seen as rude because people only use it in a rude way. A perfect example is op themself like the only reason people ask why are you quiet is out of concern or they are just genuinely curious and 90% of the time they are just genuinely curious but people only ever insult loud people. I have never once seen a quiet person get insulted for being quiet only loud people do for being loud", "\u201cwhy are you so loud\u201d is basically them saying shut up. thats why its rude", "How was OP attacked? Someone asked him a simple question.", "He was reaching out to make a social connection.  You should definitely apologize. \n \nYou don't have to talk about the great philosophers or go into depth about how your parents abused you to engage back with him.  You can simply say, \"I'm just quiet, man. Don't like talking.\" And most likely that'd be the end of it.  Instead you were unnecessarily rude.\n \nI'm a massive introvert until I know people well. But my folks taught me how to be polite.  Manners are basically just social lubricant to get you through the day. You created friction where there was none.", "Why does Reddit assume the workplace is a field of enemies and that everyone is out to get you. Non Reddit brain rotted people sometimes feel bad that the quiet person isn\u2019t included and assume they\u2019re shy. They\u2019re trying to be nice. People by default attempt conversation to be nice and create a comfortable atmosphere but introverts who make it their personality trait are always so rude about it it\u2019s no wonder people think so lowly of them and find them antisocial hostile people.", "Or just simple curiosity? Or it's forbidden to ask something up front in the face?", "I would apologise but keep it brief, you owe an apology not an explanation. I have worked with a number of introverts, some of whom were disliked because they were \"stand offish\", \"aloof\", or \"prickly\". Others were \"okay, they're just very private\" and so we're accepted as such.\nIt's a difficult path to tread as it's going against the accepted norm, but like it or not we need to get along with each other.", "You might want to seek therapy.", "I think we share the same ex MIL!", "I get that but I think there's another way to look at it. The guy was like hey, there's too little of you here. Project more you into this space! Not saying coworker did it kindly or with that in mind but it could be read as that and it's an opportunity for op that they could take that wouldn't have to mean being not themselves.\n\n\nIn my experience saying \"I'm super shy but I'm here!\" in some way can lead to bonding with people who initially may not understand.", "I second that suggestion, buy the guy a beer and apologise", "\u201cWhy are you so quiet\u201d is basically the other guy saying \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with you, why aren\u2019t you normal\u201d.", "Are you the kind of person who asks \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you married yet?\u201d and thinks it\u2019s just a question and not an insult?", "Quite often when people ask questions like this, they are making a judgement but with the justification of \"just asking questions\".", "No, that\u2019s not how you make a social connection. He could have hi, how\u2019s your day? Or made neutral small talk. Talk about the weather, or how it\u2019s Monday, or whatever. He chose to ask an obnoxious personal question.", "Reaching out to make a social connection? \ud83d\ude02 Wow, the standards for socialising have really going downhill. \"You never say nothing!\" could've been replaced with a simple \"hi, how's it going?\" Maybe even asked OP if he'd like to join him.\n\nThat said, OP should have pointed this out a little calmer, taken the higher ground. But OPs reaction doesn't change the fact that the guy didn't start the interaction off on a great foot.", "It's not that I think they're out to get anyone, it's just that a coworker is a specific type of relationship and that relationship has zero need for personal information. People also by default don't attempt conversations as a way to be nice, especially to people they know to be quiet and not want to converse. Extroverts make it their entire personality to be loud and obnoxious, being quiet and bluntly reserved is far less rude.", "seriously, any other day we encourage communication", "You're supposed to leave an anonymous note on their door and hide.", "Even if he had just said hey how are you before asking me I would\u2019ve just answered normally. But he just randomly turned around in the lunch room and blurted it out at me while I wasn\u2019t even looking at him.", "Exactly-this feels like strangers telling someone (usually women) to smile.  Why?  What difference is it to you? Co worker should have started with hello, how are you? And then let it go.", "That's absolutely untrue. Not only can you learn a lot about work related information, you also can help out your teammates as well.\n\nI'm more introverted, and realize that there are varying degrees to each side, but communicating with your teammates can have some serious advantages.\n\nYou'll also be more likely to get promoted, raises, positive reviews.", "As someone who gets frequently asked stupid questions ( about my size because I'm skinny and apparently that's everyone's business), I have a set of answers ready, depending on who is asking. I hate having to think on my feet for an answer to something I don't feel should be asked. In your case, it might help to have some answers ready from \"I'm more of a listener really\" to, at work, \"I'm quiet here so the bosses don't notice me\ud83d\ude03\". Whatever you are comfortable with and that suits your personality", "Being more willing to talk to people doesn't actually mean that someone is any less socially awkward.\n\nCome up with a phrase to say to people who overstep that makes your boundaries clear without being actively rude and stick with that.\n\nAnd yes, apologise, if nothing else you don't want bad blood in the workplace. Just say something like \"sorry I snapped, I get asked that question a lot & it annoys me because x, but I shouldn't have taken all that frustration out on you\". Apologise for your part but make it clear why he needs to mind his own business", "You also said that you aren\u2019t particularly interest in people, which is beyond just being quiet.
