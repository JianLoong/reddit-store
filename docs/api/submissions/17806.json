YTA. Let me explain.\n\nPeople have different reasons to be quiet. While you prefer it not everyone is like that. Some people are shy, have self esteem issues or other problems. You did now know what intentions our coworkers has to ask you, you had no reason to think they were malicious. Yet you assumed it was an accusation and answered rudely. You did not own friendship or explanation to your coworker, but FFS, how hard is it to assume they were friendly, smile, politely say \"I just prefer it this way\" instead of creating tension at your workplace?", "YTA. You are an adult, use your words. It\u2019s just as easy to say \u201cthat\u2019s rude to ask\u201d as it is to be an asshole, like you were. It could have been a teaching opportunity for someone who didn\u2019t realize what he said was wrong, but you reinforced the idea that quiet people have something \u201cwrong\u201d with them.", "As a 40 year old fellow \u201cquiet person\u201d I get it- I\u2019m exhausted/baffled by the question. But soft YTA for your reaction, you kinda snapped and it was his first time asking, if he\u2019d been pestering you that would be one thing, but he might not have meant it badly.", "YTA. You might be tired of that question, but it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s asking. He might not even be aware of others asking you all the time. \n\nIt was more of an attempt to start a conversation, not an accusation.", "YTA for how you treated you coworker. That being said I do understand your frustration with the situation and how your introversion is received by other people. if you want to apologize to your coworker you can tell him that you prefer being alone and that it bothers you when people find it weird or wrong and that it wasn\u2019t ok to take it out on him like that. You may or may not care, but maybe he thought you had a hard time talking to people and wanted to approach you, which maybe he shouldn\u2019t have done during your lunch break. Over all I\u2019d say not to take it so personally! It seems like that question is a sore spot for you", "YTA, and yes you need to apologize. If you don't this guy is going to think you hate him which creates an uncomfortable work environment. Blowing up like that is unprofessional and can give other people a bad impression of you.", "I feel you in that situation, I really do. Quiet and reserved people are made to feel \"wrong,\" \"lesser\" etc when really, the world wouldn't work if every single person was a loudmouth.\n\nWhat you said was rude, yes. There were better ways to respond. What he said was also rude.\n\nESH, you should apologize. But if I were you, I'd use this as a chance to let the guy know what he said was rude too.", "In this situation YTA, \nNoone wants their Head bitten of for trying to make conversation. I get why you get annoyed by that type of question, because apparently it is not socially acceptable to be quite among groups of people. But you need to be respectfull about other people as well.", "YTA. Look, dude, I despise small talk too but heres a tip, When you first get to a new job, socialize a little and make it known you just really don't like small talk. Be friendly, be polite. After a couple of weeks people will know your pace and self adjust. They will know your social barriers. A little bit of work goes a long way towards people leaving you the fuck alone.", "A very gentle and soft, YTA but only based on snapping at a coworker, unless he was all \"Hey, look at the quiet freak over here\" type of way.\n\nBut your experience made me think - generally people feel OK to ask \"Why are you so quiet?\" or \"How do you stay so skinny?\" yet if it was reversed as \"Why are you so loud?\" or \"Why are you so fat?\" then boy howdy that is just not be acceptable.", "This is kind of an ESH situation, first it\u2019s none of your coworkers business, it just isn\u2019t, secondly you could\u2019ve calmly told him your situation like \u201clook man, I\u2019m very uncomfortable, with small talk\u201c I do think your coworker deserves an apology though.", "Kinda ESH but honestly speaking from experience, all the polite replies people in the comments are saying you should have used? Yeah they don\u2019t work. \n\nThe kind of person who asks you why you\u2019re quiet isn\u2019t the kind of person who will accept a polite response. They\u2019ll just keep on harping on like a kid asking their mom why over and over again. \n\nSometimes you have to be a bit of an AH to get people to accept you are the way you are. And I bet if you go back to apologise he\u2019ll start going on about how he can help bring you out of you shell or something", "YTA. Your coworker didn't do much to set you off.\n\nSure these kind of questions are usually very intrusive and annoying, if they are meant in condescending way of the person keeps pushing the topic after you said it's not something to worry about. The way you describe it it sounds like a clunky attempt to make contact with you. He's not in the wrong for trying once, you're not in the wrong for declining. Snapping at him right off the bat is pretty unhinged though.", "YTA. Yes you should apologize. I\u2019m quiet too. I have coworkers tell me that all the time. And sometimes it opens conversations with them which is fine. \n\nNow your coworker thinks you\u2019re probably quiet because you don\u2019t have anything nice to say. You don\u2019t need to explain anything to him. He doesn\u2019t need a life story but the coworker didn\u2019t deserve that reaction from you.", "A small YTA .\nYour reply would be ok or even funny among friends and family at times but inappropriate at workplace.\nYou can talk to him and do a small apology. Better not to have bad blood at workplace unnecessary.", "YTA The man asked you an innocent question. How was he supposed to know that you've been asked that same question so many times before and was tired of it? You should apologize.", "NTA. \n\nWild to me that everyone views \u201cwhy are you so quiet\u201d as an ok question but \u201cwhy are you so loud\u201d as rude.", "NTA, but if you feel like your coworker needs the apology you should apologise. Or maybe just let him know that you\u2019re not much for chit chat in general, then at least he won\u2019t keep trying. \nI completely understand where you\u2019re coming from though. It\u2019s very frustrating to have to justify your quiet nature when other people have a problem with it.", "NTA. What your coworker said was rude and insulting. It is never ok to ask \"why are you so quiet?\" And it's especially hostile to do it to a coworker. I don't blame you for snapping. I guess if you wanted the same deniability you could've asked \"why are you so loud?\" It sucks that people expect you to just sit back and take insults.\n\nThey are just projecting their insecurity onto you. Your comfort with silence and not talking makes them feel threatened. It's totally their issue.", "NTA I think attacking back when you\u2019re attacked is an excellent strategy.\n\nIt\u2019s not overly accepted in American culture, but I think it\u2019s very effective", "NTA at all. This would be extremely frustrating. You weren't the rude one here.", "Yeah, there no call for your behavior in work place.  \nYou may need some mental help.   Think about it.", "YTA you were the one unnecessarily rude here.", "ESH.I get you. I am an introvert and have the same problem. In a group setting I am the quiet one and got asked about it a lot of times. But you can still be respectful when someone asks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At first Ford formed a theory to account for this human behaviour. If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths seize up. After a few months' consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one. If they don't keep on excercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working.\n\nDouglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", "NTA!\nhe was very rude with how he asked you the question. ive seen people get too comfortable being that way towards us quiet people. Time we put our foot down. Last time someone asked me why im so quiet i said because i didnt want to talk to them \ud83d\ude02 its really not something you should ask someone. The equivalent really is if we were to ask \"why do you talk so much?\" to these people. And i guess if the shoe fits, they really shouldnt be offended by what you said either if what they said 'wasnt bad'. Because again, its essentially the equivalent and based on his original question i would feel like he'd be able to joke about it at least or be like \"you got me there haha\"", "NTA. I really disagree with everyone saying YTA. How was he not intrusive? Since when is it ok to ask that kind of stuff... It was clearly not a positive thing in his mind when he asked. It's also incredibly stupid to ask that as it's likely going to make the person more quiet?", "ESH I think his question was overstepping. He realized you never say anything. Did he really thought this way of questioning is the right way? \n\nBut yeah, your reaction was over the top. I can understand that you got pissed off. I'm autistic and also quiet like a rock around most people i don't feel comfortable with, especially in groups. I heard this so often. What do they want as a reaction? \"What? no! I talk all the time! You can't hear it? Get your ears checked out.\"  Yes, i'm quiet, good observation, here is your gold star. But at best you don't let them get to you. Look them in the eyes and then just say \"Yes.\" I think this is the best way since they want to start a conversation with you and you don't give it to them with a simple yes. \n\nWhen you feel the next time that such a question makes you angry, take a deep breath. At least for me it works to breath the impulse reaction away.", "This is a very gentle but poignant YTA. You have every right to not want to engage in small talk and be left to your own devices, but communicating that with people who are inquisitive is important in order to garner respect. No one can read your mind, so you have to be the one to make your boundaries known to others. You're not a bad person, and I'm sure getting the question over and over is frustrating, but you still are accountable for your actions (and I'm sure you know that).", "There is no reason for a coworker to ask that question. That alone shows their intentions aren't pure.", "Yeah I probably didn\u2019t help how he views me", "Yeah it\u2019s my brain automatically assuming that it\u2019s an accusation based on past experiences. I took it the wrong way without knowing what his intentions were", "Fair enough. If anything I only reinforced the belief that quiet people have something wrong with them", "Right!", "Dude was trying to small talk. He left him alone when he was clearly denied, how does that make him suck? For trying to be polite?", "The intention could have been to try to include OP into the team. Some teams have a nice dynamic going on. Co-worker might have thought something makes OP feel uncomfortable. I don't think those wouldn't be pure intentions. People cannot read your mind. Communication is key in creating understanding for each other.", "To me, it sounds as if his intentions were to figure out whether there is something that makes you uncomfortable and to include you in the team. He showed interest in you as a person. If he wouldn't care, he wouldn't try to figure out why you are not talking. Thus, your reaction makes YTA. It wasn't called for.", "Dont beat yourself up. It happens. Buy him a little token of appreciation. A beer, or whatever, and appologize and tell him you just had a bad moment. Then it Will pass i am sure.", "Yeah\u2026 I think he might just have a bad impression on you specifically. I doubt he\u2019ll hold that over every quiet person he meets.", "Yes he had good intentions but in my opinion its pretty rude to ask someone such a personal question. There are other ways to make small talk without putting the other person in the spotlight.", "Yeah I\u2019ll give him an apology the next time I see the guy. I didn\u2019t have to be hostile, even if I was annoyed I could\u2019ve just answered the question", "Yeah, NTA. \n\nAnd for everyone who\u2019s saying otherwise, think about what you\u2019d say if someone randomly walked up to a naturally chatty person and said \u201cwhy are you so loud man? You never shut up!\u201d. I can guarantee almost no one would say that that person was NTA, or that they didn\u2019t deserve an impolite response. \n\nThis is no different. Just because someone is quiet doesn\u2019t mean you get to give them a hard time or treat them with disrespect.", "YTA but lightly, it\u2019s not a character judgment off one thing.\n\nI get quiet people hate hearing that. What it means though is not an accusation etc. - just an olive branch to indicate the other person is interested in talking to you, maybe hearing anything you\u2019d want to share - they\u2019d like to know you or start a conversation and they feel uncomfortable and are trying to bring it up awkwardly. I think quiet people miss that us loud people are awkward af lol and it\u2019s not said with certainty like we judging your quiet. I actually wish I\u2019d shut up lol\n\nIt\u2019s fine to say \u2018 I just prefer my music.\u2019 Or \u2018I don\u2019t have much to say\u2019 or whatever you want, simple as \u2018just how I am\u2019. You were unnecessarily rude, that\u2019s not being quiet it\u2019s being grouchy. The accusation feeling etc. is how you took it, you didn\u2019t have to be rude. \n\nI do think many people are quiet cause they don\u2019t know how else to be and it\u2019s easier. I have many quiet friends cause they find it easy with me I guess - I can start convos and so on, less pressure on them. And I somehow end up being someone they can talk to. \n\nSome quiet people will be repelled by me too, quick, cause on first instance they\u2019d just see a loud person maybe etc. I had a colleague who told me a year in that he eventually had to acknowledge my greetings were real, I wait for an answer, and didn\u2019t change - so he got close to me despite being grouchy and antisocial with everyone else (he was longest at the company too). It took him a year to actually engage with me and eventually share that resistance he has. It\u2019s funny cause every colleague told me how they tried so many social activities and such to engage him, everyone likes the guy. I just said hi, asked how he is before talking shop, listened and offered solutions to his concerns (he was a grouch and said no to a lot lol), and the only social thing was chatting when we grab coffee. It was sad that he had so many better friends waiting all the years, and stayed lonely because I don\u2019t know why. It was nice being his friend, and I just hope he learned to just engage cause all our other colleagues were genuine and more fun than I lol.\n\nAll to say, give people and yourself a chance. I\u2019d apologies lightly \u2018bro, you caught me at a bad moment with a random question sorry about the other day. I\u2019m generally quiet man, if you have something to say just tap me on the shoulder cause I mostly have music on.\u2019 Or let them know if/when to talk to you etc. Set your boundaries, don\u2019t be rude. All it took for my colleague was telling me he thought I was a fake ass peppy annoyance until he saw consistency and genuineness a year later. Anyway sorry to over share haha", "NTA,\n\nI feel like the other employee asked \u201cwhy are you so quiet \u201c in a rude manner and I would probably respond the same way you did. \n\nPeople pick on quiet people because they think they have a soft shell and won\u2019t get any retaliation and they are often offended when the quiet person defends themselves because the conversation didn\u2019t go as they planned .", "NTA, omg. That question is one of the *many* reasons I'm never going back to work in person. I hardcore disagree with everyone in the comments suggesting you give some kind of \"gentler\" or more \"polite\" answer; it literally never works. If you tell someone \"I just don't like small talk\" they laugh at you and say \"Oh, why?\" or they keep pressing you to make it with them. I can't stand that \"Why are you so quiet\" question, it's *so* rude. Being rude back to him got him to back off and leave you alone, so it worked -- and I don't even necessarily think you were rude to him, honestly. He wasn't \"just\" asking a question, he was being nosy. \n\nWhy on earth do the quiet people always have to give an excuse as to why we're quiet, anyway? Maybe more \"loud\" people *should* be asked why they're so talkative.", "YTA. There are certain social mores in this world that are just expected in a workplace. One of them is to interact well with your coworkers. As a fellow introvert, I get you'd rather sit with your headphones on and isolate yourself. I know small talk is hard and there are plenty of things you'd rather be doing than making nice with your colleagues.\n\nHowever if you ever want to get ahead in this world, being seen as a teamplayer, a friendly, approachable and collaborative person speaks volumes. You don't have to be friends with everyone you work with, or anyone, but being friendly costs you nothing.\n\nVery few jobs operate in a vacuum and being seen as easy to deal with is pretty imperative. As someone who is quiet myself, I have had that question directed at me too. I usually just smile and say 'I'm just not much of a talker', or 'sometimes I just need a bit of quiet time' in a pleasant, friendly way.", "YTA. If you're going to work in a social setting, you at least have to be polite to your coworkers. You don't have to like them or be best friends but you're being rude by ignoring everyone and then getting mad at your coworker for asking a simple question.", "As a fellow quiet person, can you lend some of your energy to me? I can't confront people even when they make me mad. My coworkers, one in particular is always up my butts. He always tries to make small talks, little jokes, you know, standard coworker things. The problem is I find his small talk really intrusive and his sense of humor horrible, borderline offensive. For months, I have been trying to tell him to shut the fuck off, I just can't. I always reply with some passive aggressive sarcastic lines which I don't think he gets.\n\nAnyway sorry for the rant. I will go with NTA here, because I totally get your frustration. And with this little unnecessary outburst, you may have saved yourself from a lot of future annoying conversations. I wish I did something like you did when I started here, so I never became friendly with that guy in the first place.\n\nEdit: Typo", "NTA in my opinion. You're naturally quiet, he's naturally loud. Really winds me up how people can't accept that not everyone is just like them.", "NTA - you matched his energy IMO. Don't let him gaslight you into thinking he was asking from a place of kindness.", "YTA.  You don't have to be rude to set boundaries.  Just say \"I'm quite introverted and like to be left to myself, mostly.\"  Then smile and turn away.", "NTA, \"why are you so quiet?\" Is not a genuine attempt at conversation. They were goading you.", "I would suggest apologizing to your coworker for blowing up at them and explaining, that they hit a nerve, because you have been asked this a lot in the past.\n\nNo need to seem like a bitch with someone you have to spend time with for 8 hours 5 days a week and can make your life a living hell...", "NTA, you weren't rude, you made the same point back to him, you're quiet because it's who you are, he's loud because it's who he is. He then over reacted saying yo it was just a question, being defensive. You asked if there was a problem and he stropped off like a child.", "NTA. I\u2019m the talkative coworker but I would never go out of my way to make a quiet coworker pay attention to me. It\u2019s obvious your lack of response wasn\u2019t out of character for you, other people just feel frustrated. Especially depending on the environment. For example, in retail the only joy (read: basic humanity) one can find sometimes is in coworkers.", "YTA. I\u2019m also a quiet person but I don\u2019t pride myself in being rude to coworkers. No one likes small talks but we don\u2019t act like animals to well meaning people who don\u2019t get our implication. You could have said that\u2019s just how I am even at home and they would have said oh okay.", "ESH, your coworker's question seems tactless and needlessly confrontational to me, but snapping at him wasn't worth it.", "YTA  this considerate man was asking you if youre okay and you made them regret talking to you again", "ESH but you do owe an apology. Its a rude question and could have been phrased much better, and your answer wasn't even that bad as a way to reframe it. However you assumed their intentions and he wasn't pestering you over and over, you frustration isn't the guy's fault. \n\nYou can even explain why you got annoyed. \"Hey, I'm sorry for snapping you before. People ask me that all the time and it really pisses me off becuase its like I'm being asked to justify myself. I don't like small talk so I don't participate in it, that's all.\" And just leave it at that. If he tries to carry on the conversation then you can continue it or you can just end the conversation and go about your day, whichever you prefer in the moment.", "Maybe he was concerned for your welfare giving you a chance to share a problem.", "Yta", "NAH. I don't know your job and job culture, but my dad is a very quiet person too and was/is a welder. He thought it was a great job because you didn't need to have chitchat, you can just listen to the news and music and work your butt off and no need to socialise, other than the project specs. However, in theory that is true, but in reality, other colleagues didn't like how he got the workload for a week done in a day and a half, thought he was weird for not wanting to chitchat, and they created a hostile environment. That happened a few times, and resulted in him getting fired first every time there was a reorganisation, bosses wanted to keep him for the work done but team wouldn't want to continue with him, so he gets voted off. I would suggest to sometimes get out of your comfort zone and make some effort to do get to know your colleagues a bit.", "YTA. Maybe you should look into anger management classes. This response isn\u2019t normal. A lot of people get asked the same question over and over and don\u2019t respond like this. It\u2019s annoying but this response is disproportional to the question. This is probably fake but still", "From zero to mad dog in 6 seconds. It's always the quiet ones you have to look out for. ESH, question was rude, your response was aggressive and rude.", "People ask that to me too. Sometimes I just smile and avoid answering . Maybe he was worried about you? Maybe he wanted to know more about you? If you dont want to answer just change the topic. Dont get mad unnecessarily", "ESH.  If the question was posed the same as you quoted it, then it's a pretty tactless way to ask.  Your response was unnecessarily aggressive as well.  Just my 2\u00a2.", "I'm like you.

If OP can\u2019t handle this situation without popping off, and all these other folks \u201care never not working from home because of this\u201d they\u2019re bound to live miserable, lonely lives and that\u2019s not being malicious. This is so minuscule that it\u2019s completely mind boggling to think anyone is so upset by this that it shifted their entire day. You cannot exist in a remotely social world if you can\u2019t respond with something other than \u201cis there a problem\u201d.", "Thank you. I'm going to use \"I'm more of a listener\" next time this happens to me. I never know what the correct response to that question is.", "I agree. I've was bullied in school so I learned to be alone also an introvert. But when I was forced into social situations I always got asked that. And had grown to learn to entertain myself. So now it's rude and I should interact when I'm fine being in the social network but being to myself.", "I generally shrugged and said \"I just am\"", "Oh man, felt that first sentence so hard. Extrovert here and am constantly saying awkward things. \ud83d\ude02", "I hate that question. It always made me feel that people thought I was defective for being myself.", "Or... it is a way to say \"hey did we do something to piss you off? We are all happy with you, you know?\"\n\nIt doesn't pay to assume the worst every time.", "If people can tell that he isn\u2019t interested in them, they should just leave him alone.  Are those people so conceited that they cannot conceive of the fact that someone exists who is not enthralled by them?", "Not being interested in people gives off bad vibes? Maybe OP just hasn't met anyone at work worth being interested in", "So because I don't like 99% of the general public and pretty much 99% of humanity I give off bad vibes? Cuz the 5 coworkers I'm friends with who also willing sought out to talk to me seems to contradict that.\n\nPeople in this day and age fucking suck. They're rude, entitled and selfish. I'm not interested in talking to most people and have RBF(resting bitch face). Most adults I interact with don't ask those questions. They try small talk like normal people. if I've had a few conversations (key note there) they've asked me that. But only after initially talking. That's not something you ask someone new to you or your group. Ita annoying, rude and most people don't want to know the answer.", "Not everybody is interested in other people, that doesn't make them bad people or *giving off bad vibes*. Some people are quiet and keep to themselves. I am on the spectrum and have to make a conscious effort to ask about people because I  know that's what I'm supposed to do. That's called masking and it's fucking exhausting. Your statement is ableist.", "Not bad vibes necessarily. More ASD traits, potentially?", "Which is what you're doing by putting extra meaning that wasn't stated in the question. If that were the intent, it means that person is making assumptions about OP.", "I am similar but I work in HR so I had to condition myself to some level of \"beeing interested\". What comes natural to others, to me it's something I have to actively do. We  have a new  one in our team and she likes to hug us when she comes in the morning. We now have an agreement that I would tell her when it is ok and when not, and she always respects this. I am also very big on consent and make my boundaries clear but sometimes I can agree to a hug... \ud83d\ude04", "No, it's just being a member of polite society.\n\nI don't really care about any of my coworkers either, but if one of them talks about her baby or something I'm gonna be nice and feign interest.\n\nIf you're gonna act completely disinterested and withdrawn then you're refusing to engage in polite society.\n\nThat's fine too, you just can't act all surprised when people aren't polite to you either (as in the OP).", "Considering the way he snapped over an innocuous question, yea. I'm betting he gives off bad vibes.\n\nBut yes, generally, given that humans are social creatures/pack animals people who aren't interested in people will be seen as weird or give off a bad vibe, generally", "Yes, of course it does. Who enjoys being in a room with someone who you can feel dislikes being in that room with you?", "Hugging at work?  That would have been a \u201cNo\u201d the first time she approached me.", "The co-worker started the conversation with a rude question.  That is not in the same category as talking about a newborn baby.", "It wasn't an innocuous question, it was a rude one.  Some people just aren't very social or don't like to socialize with coworkers", "What innocuous question? The only question I read was weird and intrusive.", "I wouldn't make a bet off of that. I am a quiet person and OP is the AH in this situation, I too don't find a lot of people interesting enough to interact with beyond necessary but I wouldn't snap at a random person for such a question.\n\nHim snapping is just due to built up frustration, he's still in the wrong but I wouldn't say that automatically means his aura/vibe is tainted.", "If all OP does is mind their business and listen to music then how does that relate to disliking being in the same room? Lack of interaction beyond necessary doesn't mean dislike, not everyone wants to be chatty", "I\u2019m a naturally quiet person. I don\u2019t dislike people that I\u2019m quiet around. I just often prefer to not speak. Has nothing to do with them.", "I don't enjoy it, but I accept that it's perfectly fine to be disliked. As long as they're being polite to me as needed and it doesn't interfere with work, I'm ok with people not liking me. That being said, I do try to figure out what the reason is, if it's something that can be addressed to make things better for everyone, then I'm totally up for making those changes.", "That\u2019s weird.  Why would you think someone just living their own life dislikes you just because they\u2019re not a chatterbox?", "Yes It's not something I would ever initiate. She is a very approachable person and as long as she respects my boundaries she can hug away the others in our team as much as everyone agreed to \ud83d\ude04... i must admit it made for a bit a 'softer' work enviroment, since she joined our team and that is not such a bad thing. Our job is stressfull enough \ud83e\udee0", "Look people can generally tell when someone finds them uninteresting. And if you notice that omeone is uninterested in you / dislikes you, you're very unlikely to like them.", "Sure but he makes it clear in this post that those around him are boring. Probably those people can tell what he thinks, that he isn't just disinterested in chatting but actively thinks everyone he works with is dull. People don't like to feel judged that way."]}
