I hate small talk, I don\u2019t like talking about myself and I\u2019m not particularly interested in other people either. It seems like every workplace I go to people think I\u2019m weird because I don\u2019t socialize. I\u2019m not rude or anything, I just don\u2019t go out of my way to have conversations with people I\u2019d rather listen to my music. The other day while I was on lunch break one of my coworkers just randomly asks me while I\u2019m minding my own business \u201cwhy are you always so quiet man? You never say nothing!\u201d. and immediately I got so pissed off. Without thinking I responded \u201csame reason why you\u2019re so loud\u201d and he was all like \u201cyo man relax it was just a question\u201d. Then I said \u201cis there a problem or\u2026?\u201d and he said \u201calright never mind man I\u2019ll leave you alone\u201d and that was that. \n\nI feel like I was unnecessarily rude here but it\u2019s just I\u2019m so sick of people asking me that question and making it sound like an accusation. It\u2019s like being quiet is a bad thing to them or it means there\u2019s something wrong with me. Like why even ask someone that? I know I could\u2019ve just said something like \u201coh idk\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s just the way I am\u201d but why should I have to explain why I\u2019m minding my own business? Still I took out my anger on this guy when it really wasn\u2019t about him, it was the fact I\u2019ve been asked that stupid question so many times that annoyed me. \n\nIf I am the asshole, should I apologize to him?

YTA. Let me explain.\n\nPeople have different reasons to be quiet. While you prefer it not everyone is like that. Some people are shy, have self esteem issues or other problems. You did now know what intentions our coworkers has to ask you, you had no reason to think they were malicious. Yet you assumed it was an accusation and answered rudely. You did not own friendship or explanation to your coworker, but FFS, how hard is it to assume they were friendly, smile, politely say \"I just prefer it this way\" instead of creating tension at your workplace?", "YTA. You are an adult, use your words. It\u2019s just as easy to say \u201cthat\u2019s rude to ask\u201d as it is to be an asshole, like you were. It could have been a teaching opportunity for someone who didn\u2019t realize what he said was wrong, but you reinforced the idea that quiet people have something \u201cwrong\u201d with them.", "As a 40 year old fellow \u201cquiet person\u201d I get it- I\u2019m exhausted/baffled by the question. But soft YTA for your reaction, you kinda snapped and it was his first time asking, if he\u2019d been pestering you that would be one thing, but he might not have meant it badly.", "YTA. You might be tired of that question, but it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s asking. He might not even be aware of others asking you all the time. \n\nIt was more of an attempt to start a conversation, not an accusation.", "YTA for how you treated you coworker. That being said I do understand your frustration with the situation and how your introversion is received by other people. if you want to apologize to your coworker you can tell him that you prefer being alone and that it bothers you when people find it weird or wrong and that it wasn\u2019t ok to take it out on him like that. You may or may not care, but maybe he thought you had a hard time talking to people and wanted to approach you, which maybe he shouldn\u2019t have done during your lunch break. Over all I\u2019d say not to take it so personally! It seems like that question is a sore spot for you", "YTA, and yes you need to apologize. If you don't this guy is going to think you hate him which creates an uncomfortable work environment. Blowing up like that is unprofessional and can give other people a bad impression of you.", "I feel you in that situation, I really do. Quiet and reserved people are made to feel \"wrong,\" \"lesser\" etc when really, the world wouldn't work if every single person was a loudmouth.\n\nWhat you said was rude, yes. There were better ways to respond. What he said was also rude.\n\nESH, you should apologize. But if I were you, I'd use this as a chance to let the guy know what he said was rude too.", "In this situation YTA, \nNoone wants their Head bitten of for trying to make conversation. I get why you get annoyed by that type of question, because apparently it is not socially acceptable to be quite among groups of people. But you need to be respectfull about other people as well.", "YTA. Look, dude, I despise small talk too but heres a tip, When you first get to a new job, socialize a little and make it known you just really don't like small talk. Be friendly, be polite. After a couple of weeks people will know your pace and self adjust. They will know your social barriers. A little bit of work goes a long way towards people leaving you the fuck alone.", "A very gentle and soft, YTA but only based on snapping at a coworker, unless he was all \"Hey, look at the quiet freak over here\" type of way.\n\nBut your experience made me think - generally people feel OK to ask \"Why are you so quiet?\" or \"How do you stay so skinny?\" yet if it was reversed as \"Why are you so loud?\" or \"Why are you so fat?\" then boy howdy that is just not be acceptable.", "This is kind of an ESH situation, first it\u2019s none of your coworkers business, it just isn\u2019t, secondly you could\u2019ve calmly told him your situation like \u201clook man, I\u2019m very uncomfortable, with small talk\u201c I do think your coworker deserves an apology though.", "Kinda ESH but honestly speaking from experience, all the polite replies people in the comments are saying you should have used? Yeah they don\u2019t work. \n\nThe kind of person who asks you why you\u2019re quiet isn\u2019t the kind of person who will accept a polite response. They\u2019ll just keep on harping on like a kid asking their mom why over and over again. \n\nSometimes you have to be a bit of an AH to get people to accept you are the way you are. And I bet if you go back to apologise he\u2019ll start going on about how he can help bring you out of you shell or something", "YTA. Your coworker didn't do much to set you off.\n\nSure these kind of questions are usually very intrusive and annoying, if they are meant in condescending way of the person keeps pushing the topic after you said it's not something to worry about. The way you describe it it sounds like a clunky attempt to make contact with you. He's not in the wrong for trying once, you're not in the wrong for declining. Snapping at him right off the bat is pretty unhinged though.", "YTA. Yes you should apologize. I\u2019m quiet too. I have coworkers tell me that all the time. And sometimes it opens conversations with them which is fine. \n\nNow your coworker thinks you\u2019re probably quiet because you don\u2019t have anything nice to say. You don\u2019t need to explain anything to him. He doesn\u2019t need a life story but the coworker didn\u2019t deserve that reaction from you.", "A small YTA .\nYour reply would be ok or even funny among friends and family at times.\nYou can talking to him and do a small apology. Better not to have bad blood at workplace unnecessary.", "YTA The man asked you an innocent question. How was he supposed to know that you've been asked that same question so many times before and was tired of it? You should apologize.", "NTA. \n\nWild to me that everyone views \u201cwhy are you so quiet\u201d as an ok question but \u201cwhy are you so loud\u201d as rude.", "NTA, but if you feel like your coworker needs the apology you should apologise. Or maybe just let him know that you\u2019re not much for chit chat in general, then at least he won\u2019t keep trying. \nI completely understand where you\u2019re coming from though. It\u2019s very frustrating to have to justify your quiet nature when other people have a problem with it.", "NTA. What your coworker said was rude and insulting. It is never ok to ask \"why are you so quiet?\" And it's especially hostile to do it to a coworker. I don't blame you for snapping. I guess if you wanted the same deniability you could've asked \"why are you so loud?\" It sucks that people expect you to just sit back and take insults.\n\nThey are just projecting their insecurity onto you. Your comfort with silence and not talking makes them feel threatened. It's totally their issue.", "NTA I think attacking back when you\u2019re attacked is an excellent strategy.\n\nIt\u2019s not overly accepted in American culture, but I think it\u2019s very effective", "NTA at all. This would be extremely frustrating. You weren't the rude one here.", "Yeah, there no call for your behavior in work place.  \nYou may need some mental help.   Think about it.", "YTA you were the one unnecessarily rude here.", "ESH.I get you. I am an introvert and have the same problem. In a group setting I am the quiet one and got asked about it a lot of times. But you can still be respectful when someone asks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At first Ford formed a theory to account for this human behaviour. If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths seize up. After a few months' consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one. If they don't keep on excercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working.\n\nDouglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", "NTA!\nhe was very rude with how he asked you the question. ive seen people get too comfortable being that way towards us quiet people. Time we put our foot down. Last time someone asked me why im so quiet i said because i didnt want to talk to them \ud83d\ude02 its really not something you should ask someone. The equivalent really is if we were to ask \"why do you talk so much?\" to these people. And i guess if the shoe fits, they really shouldnt be offended by what you said either if what they said 'wasnt bad'. Because again, its essentially the equivalent and based on his original question i would feel like he'd be able to joke about it at least or be like \"you got me there haha\"", "NTA. I really disagree with everyone saying YTA. How was he not intrusive? Since when is it ok to ask that kind of stuff... It was clearly not a positive thing in his mind when he asked. It's also incredibly stupid to ask that as it's likely going to make the person more quiet?", "ESH I think his question was overstepping. He realized you never say anything. Did he really thought this way of questioning is the right way? \n\nBut yeah, your reaction was over the top. I can understand that you got pissed off. I'm autistic and also quiet like a rock around most people i don't feel comfortable with, especially in groups. I heard this so often. What do they want as a reaction? \"What? no! I talk all the time! You can't hear it? Get your ears checked out.\"  Yes, i'm quiet, good observation, here is your gold star. But at best you don't let them get to you. Look them in the eyes and then just say \"Yes.\" I think this is the best way since they want to start a conversation with you and you don't give it to them with a simple yes. \n\nWhen you feel the next time that such a question makes you angry, take a deep breath. At least for me it works to breath the impulse reaction away.", "This is a very gentle but poignant YTA. You have every right to not want to engage in small talk and be left to your own devices, but communicating that with people who are inquisitive is important in order to garner respect. No one can read your mind, so you have to be the one to make your boundaries known to others. You're not a bad person, and I'm sure getting the question over and over is frustrating, but you still are accountable for your actions (and I'm sure you know that).", "There is no reason for a coworker to ask that question. That alone shows their intentions aren't pure.", "Yeah I probably didn\u2019t help how he views me", "Yeah it\u2019s my brain automatically assuming that it\u2019s an accusation based on past experiences. I took it the wrong way without knowing what his intentions were", "Fair enough. If anything I only reinforced the belief that quiet people have something wrong with them", "Right!", "Dude was trying to small talk. He left him alone when he was clearly denied, how does that make him suck? For trying to be polite?", "The intention could have been to try to include OP into the team. Some teams have a nice dynamic going on. Co-worker might have thought something makes OP feel uncomfortable. I don't think those wouldn't be pure intentions. People cannot read your mind. Communication is key in creating understanding for each other.", "To me, it sounds as if his intentions were to figure out whether there is something that makes you uncomfortable and to include you in the team. He showed interest in you as a person. If he wouldn't care, he would wouldn't try to figure out why you are not talking. Thus, your reaction makes YTA. It wasn't called for.", "Dont beat yourself up. It happens. Buy him a little token of appreciation. A beer, or whatever, and appologize and tell him you just had a bad moment. Then it Will pass i am sure.", "Yeah\u2026 I think he might just have a bad impression on you specifically. I doubt he\u2019ll hold that over every quiet person he meets.", "Yes he had good intentions but in my opinion its pretty rude to ask someone such a personal question. There are other ways to make small talk without putting the other person in the spotlight.", "Yeah I\u2019ll give him an apology the next time I see the guy. I didn\u2019t have to be hostile, even if I was annoyed I could\u2019ve just answered the question"]}
