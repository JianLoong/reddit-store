She left us everything and we are also organizing the funeral.  \r  \n\r  \nWhen I was 14, my mother married Jacques.  He also has a son Heni (now 19).  Henri was always a little shit.

My mother had no spine when it came to standing up to Jacques and Henri knew it.\r  \n\r  \nThe big turning point came when Henri complained that my grandparents gave Maurice and I better presents than him. Which they did. They still got him something, but not as much and not as nice. Jacques went to my mother, and my mother went to my grandfather and said that unless they can treat Henri as a full grandchild, that they won't have contact with us.  \r  \n\r  \nMy grandfather was a good man, but stubborn as a mule. Stubborn enough to stand up to the Nazis as a mere boy, so he wasn't going to let anybody boss him around. He despised Jacques and also thought Henri was a spoiled little shit.  He said Henri is not his grandson and that he's never going to regard him as such. He will treat him respectfully, but it is not his grandson. So, my mother cut us off from our grandparents.  Maurice and I secretly kept in contact with our grandparents until we moved out.  When Maurice was old enough, he moved to Strasbourg to live with them. I now live in Nantes while I go to university. Both of us have very little contact with out Mother.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, over COVID, my grandfather died. Sadly, before I ever got to see him again due to my mother not allowing it. My grandmother told my mother that she broke my grandfather's heart by taking her grandson (me) away from her father to please her shitty ogre of a husband and his shitty runt of a child.  My mother was unwelcome at the funeral unless she was coming to apologize to her father before he went in the ground and that she better not dare bring Jacques and Henri.  My mother hung up the phone and they never spoke again. My grandmother never forgave my mother for this.\r  \n\r  \nThen last week, our grandmother passed. My mother heard about it and said she was coming to Strasbourg to manage the estate.  Maurice told her that the estate had nothing to do with her. It was left solely to him and myself and she has no part of it.  We could tell she was fuming, but held it in. \r  \n\r  \nThen she asked about the funeral and I told her that I didn't think it was appropriate she come. She parted ways with my grandmother in life, so it is inappropriate for her to be standing there for her now that she's gone. My mother said she wanted to make things right. I said fine, I do know one way where I think our grandparents would welcome her.  Under my grandfather's terms. If she was coming to apologize and she can't bring her ogre of a husband and his goblin child. She started cursing us, we cursed her back and blocked her.

It was so cruel of your mother to keep you from getting to see your grandparents for so long. I can understand how it would take a long time, if ever, for you to forgive her. \n\nThe ironic thing is that if this was 6 years ago and your mother was asking if she was the asshole for denying you access to your grandparents people would be fawning over her for being so good to your stepbrother and saying your grandparents were monsters who you should be kept safe from.", "ESH. I'm sorry for your loss, and I'm sorry that you grew up in a deeply crappy situation with a mother that only seems to relate to other family members by battling them or neglecting them. There's no reason to follow her example. The only person who should be able to dictate who can come to your grandmother's funeral is your grandmother. So unless she said that's what she wanted -- for *her* *own* funeral -- it isn't right for you to decide who deserves to mourn your grandmother and who doesn't.", "[deleted]", "Unpopular opinion but YTA.\n\nYour mother sucks, for sure, but her mother just died, surely you can give her grace here? Your grandmother and grandfather raised her(I assume) and it kinda sounds like she took after them in her stubbornness and iron fist way of dealing with you and your brother. \n\nI\u2019d say, give her some time to say goodbye to this very important person from her life, at the very least like an hour or two before or after the actual funeral so that she can say her goodbye properly. \n\nI understand your grandmother didn\u2019t want her to go, but funerals are for the living, the dead person doesn\u2019t know who\u2019s there or not.", "While I can well understand your anger against your mom and I think you're NTA, I believe you're going to have a nasty surprise with the succession. Since you live in France and all have (I suppose fake (and obviously dated)) French names, that you're french. And that means your mother is going to inherit a bigger part of the estate than you and your brother. If she's their only child, she'll inherit 50% of it and that's only if there is a testament giving the rest to you or someone else. Otherwise she'll inherit 100%. In France you can't desinherit your children, only of a part (which is 50% with 1 child, 30% with 2, 25% with 3).\nThe only silver lining in that is that your mother can't give more than a third of her own estate to her step child. But she can also spend it all or give a good chunk of it to her husband. Good luck.", "Thank you!  Maurice have been going through old pictures and letters in the attic with an old bottle of calvados and the memories.\n\nUnfortunately, even if she were to come to apologize, it is a day late and a dollar short since my grandparents are no longer here for it. However, as my grandfather did give those conditions, we will honor it.\n\nFinally, much approval for your username. My favorite dog as a child used to eat bees.  She was a sweet dog, but as dumb as a sack of hammers.", "That is exactly what Maurice told her.  A day late and a Franc short.", "Thank you for the good, practical advice.  Maurice lives in the house so that is already secure.  We have already hired a lawyer who is handling the financial angles and the initial papers have already been signed with a notary.  The accounts are thoroughly untouchable until the administration is finished.", "Quite the opposite.  She has no spine.  I believe it is Jacques driving the bus on everything, just as he has all along.  If that woman had as much steel in her body as my grandfather had in his baby toe, none of this would have ever happened.", "Given that it is on private property which Maurice and I are hiring for the day, it seems we can.  We have confirmed this with the funeral home.", "Why does she deserve grace now? She had years to talk to her mother when she was alive but chose to be cruel to her instead. Let the people who actually loved OP\u2019s grandmother be there, not her.", "Your dog sounds absolutely adorable!", "\"Manage the estate\" with a moving truck, maybe.", "Good- you already seem to have things taken care of. I guess it comes down to if you two want her there. It was her mother, but it\u2019s ok to say no to step family if they bring pain to you and are what caused the estrangement.", "Make sure you hire security for the house for any visitation, the funeral, any time that no one would be there. Funeral information is usually public (at least it is in the US) & unfortunately, people take advantage. Your mother sounds like one who would try to break in and steal what she would probably call her birthright. Condolences on your losses, and best of luck for the future.", "[deleted]", "From our perspective, no.  Plus, we're pretty sure she will try and press us to give her money from the will.  That will for sure happen sooner or later, but we don't need it that day.", "Yes. Quite so.  Maurice would actually do quite a bit worse.\n\nShe does not get to cut us off from our grandparents and then scorn them while they live and then show up at the funeral as if none of that happened.  My grandparents had to live with it, so must she.  Unless she is coming to apologize, she has no place here."]}
