Since you live in France and all have (I suppose fake (and obviously dated)) French names, that you're french. And that means your mother is going to inherit a bigger part of the estate than you and your brother. If she's their only child, she'll inherit 50% of it and that's only if there is a testament giving the rest to you or someone else. Otherwise she'll inherit 100%. In France you can't desinherit your children, only of a part (which is 50% with 1 child, 30% with 2, 25% with 3).\nThe only silver lining in that is that your mother can't give more than a third of her own estate to her step child.

She was a sweet dog, but as dumb as a sack of hammers.", "That is exactly what Maurice told her.  A day late and a Franc short.", "Thank you for the good, practical advice.

A parent might do this because they take the children from their first relationship for granted, or because they see their children as possessions rather than independent humans, or because they see them as \"the past\" as opposed to \"the new beginning\". In any case there's no excuse for a parent to act this way. It shows a lot of selfishness on the parent's part.\n\nI'm sorry for you and your brother's loss.

I wondered the same thing. Didn\u2019t we perpetually just have the \u201cmother cutting off her parents who don\u2019t treat her stepchild equally\u201d the other day? (There\u2019s the favoritism toward the stepchild but as ever we only have one side of the story.)\n\nTo me the pertinent thing is that choices have consequences. The mother chose to go no-contact with the grandparents and the consequence was that she wasn\u2019t welcome at the grandfather\u2019s funeral without the condition of not bringing the step family, and by extension, not at the grandmother\u2019s own as the grandchildren secretly maintained their connection to the grandparents and have chosen to honor those wishes.\n\n The consequence of the mother\u2019s choice is the center of the dispute, in my opinion.

When you merge families, that is your family. You don\u2019t get the option of not having your children, yes all of your children\u2019s back. Quite honestly and very literally, the mom would 100% have been in the wrong if she continued to have a relationship with her parents without drawing that boundary. If they continued to not treat her husband and new child as family, then obviously they needed to be cut out.

So this woman made the difficult decision to stand by her husband and new son, at the expense of having a relationship with her parents. And the grandchildren are now on a power trip of brokering how their mom is allowed to grieve the loss of HER parents? Wtf is going on with this comment section. You and your brother sound like horrible people. I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t have your immediate family\u2019s back when your grandparents were alive, and even worse, don\u2019t now, now that they aren\u2019t.", "There\u2019s a couple specific nuances for me. One of which is open to debate, but the other clear cut.\n\nThe mother actively favored the stepchild and stepfather over her bio children. This could be considered unreliable as we only have the POV of one of those bio children.\n\nHowever, the mother chose to go NC with the grandparents. She can\u2019t now be rightfully upset she\u2019s not welcome at the funeral and has been written out of the estate (barring any French legalities).

Small kids that are sidelined do get hurt by it but you also can't expect an instant relationship to magic itself. If the options are hurting one kid or hurting a different kid then it is very complicated and shouldn't be decided by reddit. When I acquired half grown step kids they were mostly with their mum when I saw my parents, I don't think they ever bought them a gift but they did host my step daughter and friend for her schoolies week. It's trickier for families who only have extended family on one side, but then you have to ask why are they cut off from their family.
