Since you live in France and all have (I suppose fake (and obviously dated)) French names, that you're french. And that means your mother is going to inherit a bigger part of the estate than you and your brother. If she's their only child, she'll inherit 50% of it and that's only if there is a testament giving the rest to you or someone else. Otherwise she'll inherit 100%. In France you can't desinherit your children, only of a part (which is 50% with 1 child, 30% with 2, 25% with 3).\nThe only silver lining in that is that your mother can't give more than a third of her own estate to her step child.

She was a sweet dog, but as dumb as a sack of hammers.", "That is exactly what Maurice told her.  A day late and a Franc short.", "Thank you for the good, practical advice.

A parent might do this because they take the children from their first relationship for granted, or because they see their children as possessions rather than independent humans, or because they see them as \"the past\" as opposed to \"the new beginning\". In any case there's no excuse for a parent to act this way. It shows a lot of selfishness on the parent's part.\n\nI'm sorry for you and your brother's loss.
