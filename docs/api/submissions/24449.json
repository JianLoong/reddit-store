Let's break down a few important points:  \nSafety and Well-Being: Your primary concern should be the safety and well-being of both yourself and your child. Given the history you've described involving threats, toxicity, and emotional turmoil within your ex-boyfriend's family, it's understandable that you want to create a safe environment for your child.  \nLegal and Custodial Matters: While you're trying to protect your child, you should also be aware of the legal and custodial aspects of the situation. It's crucial to understand the laws in your jurisdiction regarding parental rights, custody, and access. If your ex-boyfriend is threatening legal action, it's important to consult with legal professionals who can provide you with accurate advice and guidance.  \nBirth Certificate: The decision of whether or not to include your ex-boyfriend's name on the birth certificate is a significant one. It's a legal document that establishes parental rights and responsibilities. While your intentions are rooted in your concerns for your child's safety, keeping him off the birth certificate could potentially lead to legal complications down the line.  \nOpen Communication: In situations like these, communication is key. Try to have an open and honest conversation with your ex-boyfriend about your concerns. Discuss the history, your feelings, and your desire to ensure a safe and positive environment for your child. It's possible that he might come to understand your perspective and be willing to work with you to find a solution that prioritizes the child's well-being.  \nLegal Assistance: Given the complexity of the situation and the potential legal ramifications, it's advisable to consult with a family law attorney who can provide you with personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and the laws in your jurisdiction.  \nIn these matters, your priority should be the safety and well-being of your child. It's important to make informed decisions while also considering legal and emotional implications. Consulting with professionals and communicating openly with your ex-boyfriend are steps toward finding the best solution for your child's future.", "You know what r/lostredditors \nMaybe legaladvice would be a better place to try to get some answer/opinions", "YTA because that plan will just delay the inevitable.  Figure it out *now* before the kid gets here.  Don't go blissfully through the entire pregnancy and leave his name off, because clearly he and his family will put the money and time into establishing paternity, then you look worse for the waste of resources.  This is the reality you chose, so deal with it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Get your documents and run. It will not save you in the long run, but it will alleviate the stress and anxiety on you and the baby to grow in a nurturing environment. \n\nGrab all the evidence and screen shots you can as well. You\u2019ll need it later for part 2.", "NTA - as a student, I know you don\u2019t have a lot of time but I would reach out to even domestic violence shelters to see who they recommend for women to use and then even call around for pro-bono family lawyer and try your luck. Also from this moment on report everything to the police. If at all possible, get a restraining order against as many as you can while growing your baby. And then I highly suggest breastfeeding so visitations will be tougher for them since you are babies only source of food. Thankfully by the time mine turned one, his dad and family stopped trying and didn\u2019t come back until he was four. Those four years I built in him you keep no secrets from mom and if you get a bad feeling, you tell me at once, it doesn\u2019t mean they have to do anything but if you don\u2019t like someone, you tell me. And thankfully since he had nothing to do with him for years, visitations were built up and he didn\u2019t have his first overnight visit with his dad until he was six and fully communicating with me. It\u2019s scary but you protect yourself and your baby. Dad\u2019s often choose their parents feelings over what is best for their child so it is up to you!", "Thank you for responding, I am already in the middle of filing a police report but I needed time to gather evidence first and I didn't want to leave anything too late. He is also in a better position than I am financially and healthwise so I don't know whether reporting them would work in my favour or make everything worse. My main issue is that I didn't have a problem with him up until this point so I don't want to include him in a report to try and legally strip away his rights, I simply want him to see my point of view and try to be more understanding of the difficult decisions I believe I have to make to protect our future child.", "Thank you for your reply, I have a few things to add based on what you've said for the purposes of defending both sides. \n\nSafety and Wellbeing: I did suggest to him that anyone I had felt I was unsafe around previously could have access to my child under my supervision, the reason why this is no longer an option is because they would dispute this as he's told me multiple times that he is the dad and it isn't up to me. If it wasn't for me feeling unsafe I would happily have them involved but I just don't believe it will be a great environment for our child. \n\nLegal and Custodial/Birth Certificate: This is what scares me, as soon as he found out, he had already considered getting his family solicitor involved and due to being a student, I am not financially stable enough to do the same. I have read through some of the laws and understand he can fight all of my decisions in court but hopefully by then something will be in motion to protect our child anyway which would be a reason for me to comply to his wishes. \n\nOpen Communication: I did originally try to have a conversation about all of this with the baby's father to which he showed a complete disregard of my feelings and my reasonings before I made this post; he would give abrupt and demanding responses and I understand its a difficult situation for him too because they are his family but that doesn't make my options any easier.", "Thank you for your response, I accept your opinion but I just wanted to add that this situation is currently being challenged under social services but they cannot establish every aspect until after our child is born. The child will most likely be placed under child protection due to my history which will then allow me to put changes in place to protect him or her. I should have added that I am very early on in my pregnancy and this would only be a last resort and he has made it abundantly clear that if he cannot be around for the pregnancy (he is stopping himself through his own actions and choices) then he wants nothing at all to do with the baby which I have evidence of in various messages. If they chose to take a legal route, it would be considered that he would simply be re-fighting for his own access and not access for his family which I would agree to before the case made it to court by complying with his demands", "He's not going to. Hes made that ckear. And if he has more money then that's just more child support he can pay. Protect your child from him and his entire family.", "It sounds like you've taken many factors into consideration and are trying to navigate a challenging situation in the best way possible. Your priority is your child's safety and well-being, and it's important to advocate for what you believe is best for them.  \nNavigating legal matters and custody issues can be complex and daunting, especially when one party has more resources than the other. If you find yourself in a situation where legal action becomes necessary, you might consider seeking legal advice from organizations that provide support to individuals who are facing such challenges and may not have the financial means for their own representation.  \nCommunication is key, but if your attempts at open communication have been met with resistance or disregard, you might find it helpful to engage a neutral third party, such as a mediator or counselor, who can facilitate a conversation between you and the baby's father. They can help ensure that both parties' concerns are heard and explored in a constructive manner.  \nRemember that these decisions are complex and deeply personal. Trust your instincts, gather information, and seek support from professionals and trusted individuals in your life as you navigate this challenging situation.", "Yep.  He's clearly going to prioritize his family of origin over that child.  There's zero reason to hope otherwise.  OP should act accordingly instead of wasting time trying to convince her ex to get on board.", "Thank you, I appreciate your advice.", "First, if you put it on the internet, you have to expect that people will read it. Proceed accordingly. Had you not put this information in a place where they had ready access to it, you really could have saved yourself a headache. Seriously consider not posting about the baby on social media at all, so that you are in control of any and all information pertaining to the baby (e.g. which hospital you're at for your ultrasounds). Consider blocking his family.\n\nNTA\n\nBut, now that they know, leaving him off the birth certificate is going to open you up to them implying that you don't know who the father is because....\nIt will also mean that, while he doesn't have parental rights, he also doesn't have parental responsibilities because legally he isn't the parent.\n\nFWIW, I know someone who left the \"father\" field blank for very similar reasons. I think it's most likely the right thing to do in your situation."]}
