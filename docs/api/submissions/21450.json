{"id": 21450, "submission_id": "14rtdi6", "title": "AITA for not telling my daughter I'm proud of her because she's a sex worker?", "selftext": "Before I start, I just want to say that I don't live in the US. \n\nI (54M) have 3 kids, Madison (33F), James (30M) and Abby (27F). Their mother left when Abby was 5 because she didn't want to be a mother anymore so I had to take care of them by myself for a long time.\n\nBeing a single parent was tough. Without my ex's income, I had to work two jobs so that I could put a roof over their heads and needed the support of my parents to watch them while I was working. I was not able to save a lot but I made sure to put as much money as I could towards their college education so that they wouldn't have to take student loans.\n\nMadison wanted to become a teacher and James wanted to become a firefighter and both got into their respective fields. Abby wanted to become an engineer but dropped out after 1 year. When I asked her what her plans were, she said her roommate does sex work (onlyfans, porn, prostitution etc.) and makes a ton of money so she wants to get into that. When she told me that, I was shocked. Sex work is decriminalized where we live but it's still heavily stigmatized. I begged her to reconsider but she refused to listen to me. So I told her that she's my daughter and I'll always love her but I don't approve her career choice and I don't want to hear the day to day details of her job because that's gross for any parent to hear. \n\nShe's been doing this for a few years now and has made quite a bit of money from what I've heard. Anyway, recently Madison got a promotion in her school and had a party at her house. I didn't plan on giving a speech or anything but people urged me to so I just said I was proud of her for being successful in her career and hope she continues fulfilling her dream.\n\nOn the drive back to my house, Abby (she flew in for the party and was staying at my place) was driving and decided that time would be the best time to have this conversation:\n\nAbby: why don't you ever tell people that you're proud of me?\n\nMe: Not now. I don't want to talk about it\n\nAbby: Why not? I'm also successful\n\nMe: Now is not the right time\n\nAbby: (getting aggressive) No. I want to talk about it now. You can tell people you're proud of Madison but you can't do the same for me\n\nMe: (raising my voice) I told you I don't approve of your job. I don't want to hear about it and I'm not going to tell people I'm proud that my daughter has sex with men for money\n\nWhen I said that she started crying and then ran off to her room once we reached home. I admit that I had a bit too much to drink so the next morning I apologized to her for raising my voice and making her cry but I still stood firm that I wasn't going to lie to myself, to her or to anyone else that I'm proud of the work she's doing. She called me an asshole and slammed the door in my face.

I dont think you have to be proud of everything your child does and not every occupation inspires pride. You can however be proud for reasons that are not a job.

If I'm honest, I'd also have to admit that I wouldn't be bragging about it to my friends.  Right or wrong, that's my honest feeling.  That said, I would not love my child any less, but she could not expect me to extol her sex-for-hire virtues.", "NTA the party was for Madison, and you made a speech about Madison.  You did not mention James.  You can still love her as a parent but do not have to support her career choice or be proud of it.  Hopefully she is setting money aside to get an education, be it trade school or university.  There is only so long you can do this type of work.", "NTA. I am completely for women doing want they want with their bodies and personally don't see any problem with sex work as long as it's done safely. Despite that, I don't get why a parent would even be proud of their child for doing sex work. You can still love your daughter, but you don't have to be proud of her choices.", "Nta she darn well knows why you don't say it to people.  I'm not sure what her end game was.\n\nIf she won't take the polite deferral, then she gets the not polite truth.", "NTA man.\n\nWhile I do think that it would be useful to tell her you \\*are\\* proud of her for things that you are proud of rather than singularly focusing on the one thing you're \\*not\\* proud of it appears that the conversation she wanted to have was specifically about her work.\n\nIn that frame?  You tried to deflect, she insisted, you tried to deflect yet again, she got aggressive, so she received the truth.  I'm not sure why she would pursue this line of questioning anyway, if I'm honest.  She already knew, in plain terms, your opinion what she does for work.  I wonder why she would have expected a different answer now.", "NTA it's not something a parent can be proud of.

According to you your daughter asked if you are proud of her, not her job, and you say that you aren't proud of her job.\n\nI think your daughter needs reassurance that you love her even if you don't like her job.", "NTA\n\nI'll be downvoted for this but IDC. Sex work has or is never been a respectable profession. Idk where parents have to be proud of this. \n\nAs a parent you couldn't control her choices but you definitely can disagree on them. And for people who support this, sure please send your kids to this profession but a whole lot of people will never.", "NTA, you're being honest. What she's doing may not be illegal there, but it is still very high risk for being assaulted, getting a disease, or getting pregnant and never knowing who the father is. It's hard to imagine that any amount of money is worth that. It's also clear that you are still accepting her, just not approving of her career choice.", "NTA.   \n\n\nIt's one thing to tell your daughter you're proud of her for...something. It's quite another to brag about it to others. Some jobs just aren't brag worthy.", "I feel that I need make something clear\n\nAbby wants me to be proud of her success. She mentioned that in our conversation\n\nIt's not that I've never told her I'm not proud of any of her personal hobbies. My mother taught her how to knit and she's become very good at it and I've told her many times that I'm impressed. \n\nI'm just not proud of her full-time profession. She's made a lot of money from it, but it's not about the money for me. I'll always love her as my child and she'll always be welcome in my house if she's in trouble or needs me but I don't think it's right that I should lie and tell her that I'm proud of her success as a sex worker", "NTA. If she is looking for approval about her career choices, then she is not truly happy with what she is doing and deep down feels insecure. Otherwise she wouldn\u2019t be asking", "INFO: do you ever tell your daughter that you\u2019re proud of her? Not specifically proud of her job, but other aspects of her life? Proud of who she is as a person?", "So, I was an exotic dancer (no contact, full nudity) and one of my kids briefly worked as a cam girl (no physical contact but talking and interacting and performing sex acts online). \n\nSo although neither of us fucked people for money, we were both sexworkers - maybe \u201csexworkers lite?\u201d \n\nI was upset when my daughter told me about her work. I don\u2019t have any qualms about the morality of Fucking lots of people - I\u2019ve had a ton of partners and I don\u2019t give a rip how many people she decides to sleep with either. \n\nSo why does it upset me? Why do I care? \n\nSimply put, I think trading sex for money or money for sex is bad for people. I think it\u2019s bad for women and bad for men. I think it is corrosive to (for lack of a better word) the soul. I think sex has the potential to be sacred, healing, life affirming, beautiful, and special. But it cannot be any of those things when it is not treated that way. \n\nEverything in life is as special as you choose to make it. And sex is no different.!if you treat your body sacredly, then it is sacred. If not, it isn\u2019t. \n\nBeing a sex worker requires you to perform. To ignore an deny your actual feelings and instead pretend to have other feelings. This alienates you from your body and your own true emotions. And that alienation makes true connection more difficult when the opportunity arises. \n\nSo in as few words as possible, I don\u2019t want my daughter doing sex work not because I think it\u2019s immoral, but because I think it\u2019s unhealthy. \n\nI will probably be downvoted for this, or called a SWERF or something. But that\u2019s my two cents.\n\nNTA", "NTA. But it's also complicated.\n\nFirst and foremost, the naysayers who call you an AH likely don't have children, themselves, and/or were significantly neglected during their own childhoods.\n\nSecond, losing a mother at five, and not having a father around enough at such a young age and crucial stage of development, likely left your daughter with serious attachment issues. If you were too absent in her life, it's not much of a surprise that she'd over-correct with promiscuity.\n\nWhen she complains about you not expressing your pride in her, what she's really saying is, \"why can't you love me the way I need and want you to love me?\"\n\nYou need to show her that you love her unconditionally, and tell her that you're willing to do everything and anything it takes to help her move into something more respectable.", "NTA.

I think parents do their best to raise their kids and continue to advise them through out their whole life to help them make the best choices they can.\n\nYour youngest daughter probably has a lot of issues to process and it's not clear from your story if she has been trying to do that. Her mother abandoned her when she was young. I'm sure there was comparison and bullying goin on in school over: absentee mom, siblings, her looks, her personality, etc. She had an initial career choice but failed to achieve it, never went back to school. She might have other issues she hides from you that you don't know about.\n\nI think focusing on the job is not the right move. The job is legal and more common for young ppl to get involved in. \n\nI would instead check in with her on how her life has been and how it is now. Validate it's been hard and it's helpful to process that with someone like a therapist. Tell her other ways you're proud of her. Explain how the way you grew up you have this instilled idea of sex work and it likely won't change, but you would like to know what's going on in her life even if you disapprove of it bc you're her dad and love her. If she's been hiding issues from you maybe she'll feel more apt to share them after you say that.\n\nRemind her there isn't a competition between her and her siblings and maybe spend more quality time with her. perhaps the reasons she's drawn to the sex industry can be traced back to mental health troubles like trauma, feelings of failure and inadequacy, or a comparison between you and her other siblings. \n\ngood luck!", "NTA - as a parent I would also have a hard time being proud that my child was a sex worker.

It's truly disheartening to see in person the sheer quantity of men who have no one on their lives they can confide in.", "Yes, OP, in a non-judgmental way, can you talk to her and ask where she sees her life going from here? Reassure her that you love her and tell her the things you are proud of her for.", "Maybe he\u2019s not proud of her. You want him to lie so she can justify her work to herself?", "You know he won\u2019t. He\u2019s only focused on the job and just that. He doesn\u2019t see how this can be beyond the job. Almost like he can\u2019t find a single other thing he\u2019s told her he\u2019s proud of her for. \n\nSure he doesn\u2019t have to like her job, but come on man answer the questions.", "He did above.", "I have no idea what you are getting at? Women who are working safely by choice in the sex industry are murdered, raped, and assaulted in multitudes higher than women who are not.", "So in other words, she's emotionally troubled and expressing that by having strangers shove their cocks in every orifice she has. Not a gotcha attempt at all, you're the one that said it. \n\nYeah I'll stand by my sentiment that I would not want a loved one becoming a sex worker of any kind. People who advocate for it are likely troubled individuals themselves.", "\ud83e\udd47", "Hahahah you\u2019re acting like you\u2019ve never met another human being in your entire life. Okay sure. People totally work that way. It\u2019s definitely not sooooo common for people to not be able to talk about vulnerable topics and communicate effectively! You\u2019re right 90% of people are SO GOOD at that. Lmao. Are you from another planet? None of that is what she did at all. You just have a different view and refuse to put your personal thoughts aside on the matter. All I said was that OP clearly is proud of her in other ways and could show her that. Done deal dude.", "I don\u2019t know how I could be much more clear especially in response to previous comments. Reading through, I still think it\u2019s really obvious. And even more so think my previous advice to the last commenter to reread still is right imo.", "Ehh...it's not...*pleasant*, but the barrier to entry is very low. Pretty much anyone can do it. Sooo I think it's fair to say it's not something to be proud of. It's not really a job title you have to work hard for and earn.", "Of course not, most of the time is not. But in this case I see it like that.", "Presumably there is a lot more to her as a human being beyond dropped out of college and is a sex worker. Her employment choice is not all she is.", "He could choose to be proud of her for being independent and self sufficient which I find much more Impressive than people living at home, mooching off of partners, collecting state aid, or living off student loans.  Lazy? Lol", "Lmao oh gross you\u2019re one of those people who don\u2019t mind their own business. It isn\u2019t hurting you and I\u2019d bet money your search history includes those people so go ahead and keep paying their bills lol. OP says his daughter makes good money and you\u2019re still sad lol.", "Read his comments. He did", "I get what you're saying, I do. I don't totally buy it, but I get it. I mean sometimes a duck really *is* a duck. Back stories add opinions. My only issue is that he told her he didn't want to talk about it multiple times. Perhaps if she'd given him some space, they could have had a civil conversation where he could assure her that he's proud that she volunteers at the food pantry or that she is ambitious and diligent, or some such. \n\nWhen we force a conversation on someone we very rarely feel good after it.\n\nNTA OP", "\u201cIn my opinion\u201d is the key phrase in what you just said. It tells me that you\u2019ve decided you\u2019re right, that everyone should just understand because you want them to and that it\u2019s below you to make sure you\u2019ve communicated your point effectively. When you\u2019re communicating your opinion is not the only one that matters. Also checking for typos is generally helpful.", "Pretty much anyone can do it isn\u2019t accurate either. People have to like you. It\u2019s not usually just taking your clothes off and having sex. And if you can make someone feel special, wanted/needed or heard, you are going to be much more successful. It\u2019s pretty much just customer service without clothes. Dealing with people is hard. Dealing with their emotions and sexual desires is even harder.", "What? Did you even read my comment?\n\nAnyone can go suck a dick for $20, but not everyone can make GOOD money in the sex worker industry. It's not an easy job at all.", "There are numerous barriers to entry and there are definitely massive barriers to success (OPs daughter seems to be succeeding).  These include risk tolerance level, physical attractiveness, self confidence, communication skills (especially around boundaries and consent), open mindedness, emotional intelligence, resilience & business savvy.", "But she was asking him to be proud of her career, it's right in the story. She was jealous if him saying he's proud of his sister's career", "The other daughter had a party because of her PROMOTION AT HER JOB. He had to make a speech because of that\u2026 are you\u2026 entirely missing that part?", "It's her father? He should mind his own business? And she wants to be a sex worker but doesnt want the stigma attached, not how world works. If you expect the father to post on facebook \"Abby took a 12 incher today #prouddad\" it's not going to happen", "I agree with this assessment.  In any case, it was Madison\u2019s party so OP had no reason to bring up his feelings regarding whether or not he was proud of Abby.", "Hence why my opinion was neither being the AH. It\u2019s clear that\u2019s there\u2019s more to the story and more to her actual question. But as I was saying, people don\u2019t behave rationally all the time.", "No idea what you\u2019re even trying to get into now. I have decided that I\u2019m right that people are not rational beings. Period. That\u2019s not disputable. Literally all I said above this is that the daughter has feelings that wants her dad to be proud, made clear by the post. There\u2019s no debate about it. Whether it\u2019s actually about the job is irrelevant, it\u2019s not our business to know. OP asked if they\u2019re the AH and I gave \u201cmy opinion\u201d is that not the point of this subreddit or did I miss something?", "Uhhh it\u2019s irrelevant completely to the comments about her being lazy. She\u2019s doing what she wants it\u2019s a different path it\u2019s none of our business. The daughter asking about him being proud is clearly not actually related to her job.", "No one remotely said they expected him to do so. Can you read at all?", "He posted on an judgement sub to ask if hes the asshole in this situation? If whole sub minded own business it would literally cease to exist", "She wanted to be an engineer. (Its fine if you get to school and decide you dont wanna be an engineer, or even in school anymore for that matter) she did however say that her roommate does sex work \u201cand makes a lot of money\u201d \n\nSo thats what she ended up doing, that quite literally is as close to lazy or \u201ctaking the easy way out\u201d as it gets.", "Insults are a classic reddit tactic when your getting owned and make no sense and downvoted to hell and know it. Very similar to how a child lashes out. Surprised you didnt ask me why I care so much"]}
