Their mother left when Abby was 5 because she didn't want to be a mother anymore so I had to take care of them by myself for a long time.\n\nBeing a single parent was tough. Without my ex's income, I had to work two jobs so that I could put a roof over their heads and needed the support of my parents to watch them while I was working. I was not able to save a lot but I made sure to put as much money as I could towards their college education so that they wouldn't have to take student loans.\n\nMadison wanted to become a teacher and James wanted to become a firefighter and both got into their respective fields. Abby wanted to become an engineer but dropped out after 1 year. When I asked her what her plans were, she said her roommate does sex work (onlyfans, porn, prostitution etc.) and makes a ton of money so she wants to get into that. When she told me that, I was shocked. Sex work is decriminalized where we live but it's still heavily stigmatized. I begged her to reconsider but she refused to listen to me. So I told her that she's my daughter and I'll always love her but I don't approve her career choice and I don't want to hear the day to day details of her job because that's gross for any parent to hear. \n\nShe's been doing this for a few years now and has made quite a bit of money from what I've heard. Anyway, recently Madison got a promotion in her school and had a party at her house. I didn't plan on giving a speech or anything but people urged me to so I just said I was proud of her for being successful in her career and hope she continues fulfilling her dream.\n\nOn the drive back to my house, Abby (she flew in for the party and was staying at my place) was driving and decided that time would be the best time to have this conversation:\n\nAbby: why don't you ever tell people that you're proud of me?\n\nMe: Not now. I don't want to talk about it\n\nAbby: Why not? I'm also successful\n\nMe: Now is not the right time\n\nAbby: (getting aggressive) No. I want to talk about it now. You can tell people you're proud of Madison but you can't do the same for me\n\nMe: (raising my voice) I told you I don't approve of your job. I don't want to hear about it and I'm not going to tell people I'm proud that my daughter has sex with men for money\n\nWhen I said that she started crying and then ran off to her room once we reached home. I admit that I had a bit too much to drink so the next morning I apologized to her for raising my voice and making her cry but I still stood firm that I wasn't going to lie to myself, to her or to anyone else that I'm proud of the work she's doing. She called me an asshole and slammed the door in my face.

I dont think you have to be proud of everything your child does and not every occupation inspires pride. You can however be proud for reasons that are not a job. You can be proud that your child is kind, because they volunteer somewhere, because they are always there for family, because of a million things. You can let her know what does make you proud. I hope you don't see your daughter as being only her job.", "*Oh it's awkward it's awkward.*  NTA for feeling the way you feel about it.  You support her generally, you welcome her home, you just don't want to hear about it and hand in hand with that is not wanting to talk about it.  Raising your voice about it not ideal but she pushed it when you had been drinking", "NTA.  I like to think I am fairly liberal minded, but have to say that I would not like my daughter in this line of work and I would worry what it might mean for her safety and future.  If I'm honest, I'd also have to admit that I wouldn't be bragging about it to my friends.  Right or wrong, that's my honest feeling.  That said, I would not love my child any less, but she could not expect me to extol her sex-for-hire virtues.", "NTA the party was for Madison, and you made a speech about Madison.  You did not mention James.  You can still love her as a parent but do not have to support her career choice or be proud of it.  Hopefully she is setting money aside to get an education, be it trade school or university.  There is only so long you can do this type of work.", "NTA. I am completely for women doing want they want with their bodies and personally don't see any problem with sex work as long as it's done safely. Despite that, I don't get why a parent would even be proud of their child for doing sex work. You can still love your daughter, but you don't have to be proud of her choices.", "Nta she darn well knows why you don't say it to people.  I'm not sure what her end game was.\n\nIf she won't take the polite deferral, then she gets the not polite truth.", "NTA man.\n\nWhile I do think that it would be useful to tell her you \\*are\\* proud of her for things that you are proud of rather than singularly focusing on the one thing you're \\*not\\* proud of it appears that the conversation she wanted to have was specifically about her work.\n\nIn that frame?  You tried to deflect, she insisted, you tried to deflect yet again, she got aggressive, so she received the truth.  I'm not sure why she would pursue this line of questioning anyway, if I'm honest.  She already knew, in plain terms, your opinion what she does for work.  I wonder why she would have expected a different answer now.", "NTA it's not something a parent can be proud of. That's just weird.", "NTA she can be a sec worker all she wants but that doesn't mean you have to be proud of it -- though you still should show that you love her", "So, I read your comments about how the conversation you describe is about her job but that's not what you wrote. According to you your daughter asked if you are proud of her, not her job, and you say that you aren't proud of her job.\n\nI think your daughter needs reassurance that you love her even if you don't like her job.", "NTA\n\nI'll be downvoted for this but IDC. Sex work has or is never been a respectable profession. Idk where parents have to be proud of this. \n\nAs a parent you couldn't control her choices but you definitely can disagree on them. And for people who support this, sure please send your kids to this profession but a whole lot of people will never.\n\nEdit- I never expected this kind of distribution of opinions on my comment.\n\nNow to the people who agree or disagree I just want you to know a bit about this industry. Most of the sex workers or we say prostitutes(men, women and trans) are not voluntarily in this industry but lured, lied to or sold. I closely work with an organization who saves people from this. I really would take the opportunity to tell what I see\n\nMost of them are desperate to get out of the industry, but have no means because they are threatened to be killed or have their loved ones suffer. The things done are brutal here. For example the women are lured or sold in and the first thing that happens to them are either they are sold to highest bidder and shipped of or are impregnated. After the child is born they threaten the mother to do sex work. For men killing loved ones goes. This is just the start of abuse, followed by shows, clients, starvation, surgery, mental and physical torture. Somehow if people manage to escape they are brought back and killed or if they live in fear forever. Most of them are sold in this industry by lovers, family members or people who promise to give job and a whole lot is supplied by modeling industry.\n\nToday we have tv shows, interviews of pornstars and influencers who are at top of this industry and show the luxurious lifestyle, glitz and glamour and give a very positive image. But even they are not spared from the abuse. And a whole lot of them are the reason for a lot of people getting and trap in this industry. Idk if you believe but some of the top powerful people in this industry are same people who ones were victims but now they have their own business of doing same. I was ones told the story of a women who run a business to provide to high society clients that she was sold by her boyfriend, but today she does because she could not escape and loves the money and since she suffered she wants other to suffer. 16 girls and 2 boys were rescued from her. \n\nLast month 2 girls were rescued who got in this industry after her roommate who did high escort service told them about her money and gifts she received. One of them was being shipped to Dubai. She was doing masters in engineering. The other girl called one of her friends and told how she is trapped and her phone is taken and she cannot contact her family. The organization came to know about this and saved her but the other girl unalived herself. \n\nPositivity about sex work is good but when people voluntary step in the industry they are going to be judged. It's a fact not an opinion. And what facilities this industry, most is the politics, businessmen and entertainment and modelling industry. \n\nThe onlyfans models we see earning millions are just tip of an iceberg. Below them are people who see them as idols and follow their path only to struggle, have very little means to get by and struggle for money. Moreover that one's you pics and vids go there, it's forever and this follows.", "NTA, you're being honest. What she's doing may not be illegal there, but it is still very high risk for being assaulted, getting a disease, or getting pregnant and never knowing who the father is. It's hard to imagine that any amount of money is worth that. It's also clear that you are still accepting her, just not approving of her career choice.", "NTA.   \n\n\nIt's one thing to tell your daughter you're proud of her for...something. It's quite another to brag about it to others. Some jobs just aren't brag worthy.", "I feel that I need make something clear\n\nAbby wants me to be proud of her success. She mentioned that in our conversation\n\nIt's not that I've never told her I'm not proud of any of her personal hobbies. My mother taught her how to knit and she's become very good at it and I've told her many times that I'm impressed. \n\nI'm just not proud of her full-time profession. She's made a lot of money from it, but it's not about the money for me. I'll always love her as my child and she'll always be welcome in my house if she's in trouble or needs me but I don't think it's right that I should lie and tell her that I'm proud of her success as a sex worker", "NTA. If she is looking for approval about her career choices, then she is not truly happy with what she is doing and deep down feels insecure. Otherwise she wouldn\u2019t be asking", "INFO: do you ever tell your daughter that you\u2019re proud of her? Not specifically proud of her job, but other aspects of her life? Proud of who she is as a person?", "So, I was an exotic dancer (no contact, full nudity) and one of my kids briefly worked as a cam girl (no physical contact but talking and interacting and performing sex acts online). \n\nSo although neither of us fucked people for money, we were both sexworkers - maybe \u201csexworkers lite?\u201d \n\nI was upset when my daughter told me about her work. I don\u2019t have any qualms about the morality of Fucking lots of people - I\u2019ve had a ton of partners and I don\u2019t give a rip how many people she decides to sleep with either. \n\nSo why does it upset me? Why do I care? \n\nSimply put, I think trading sex for money or money for sex is bad for people. I think it\u2019s bad for women and bad for men. I think it is corrosive to (for lack of a better word) the soul. I think sex has the potential to be sacred, healing, life affirming, beautiful, and special. But it cannot be any of those things when it is not treated that way. \n\nEverything in life is as special as you choose to make it. And sex is no different.!if you treat your body sacredly, then it is sacred. If not, it isn\u2019t. \n\nBeing a sex worker requires you to perform. To ignore an deny your actual feelings and instead pretend to have other feelings. This alienates you from your body and your own true emotions. And that alienation makes true connection more difficult when the opportunity arises. \n\nSo in as few words as possible, I don\u2019t want my daughter doing sex work not because I think it\u2019s immoral, but because I think it\u2019s unhealthy. \n\nI will probably be downvoted for this, or called a SWERF or something. But that\u2019s my two cents.\n\nNTA", "NTA. But it's also complicated.\n\nFirst and foremost, the naysayers who call you an AH likely don't have children, themselves, and/or were significantly neglected during their own childhoods.\n\nSecond, losing a mother at five, and not having a father around enough at such a young age and crucial stage of development, likely left your daughter with serious attachment issues. If you were too absent in her life, it's not much of a surprise that she'd over-correct with promiscuity.\n\nWhen she complains about you not expressing your pride in her, what she's really saying is, \"why can't you love me the way I need and want you to love me?\"\n\nYou need to show her that you love her unconditionally, and tell her that you're willing to do everything and anything it takes to help her move into something more respectable.", "NTA.

Because: even in the west, with all the happy, chose-to-do-it and legal \u2018workers\u2019, supply never even scratches the surface of demand without trafficking and coercion.

I don't want to offend anyone who does do this line of work, but come on, what did she expect? you can love her without supporting what she's doing. she has to learn that. \n\nI'd also have a talk about her stance on it. She might be tired of it and having negative feelings towards what she's doing so she was looking for someone to make her feel it's ok again. She dropped out and that's how she makes her living. More than likely she feels stuck and no doubt it affected her friendships and will forever affect her future relationships. Let her know you're proud of who she's become as a person, and she has other options but you will never openly talk and brag about what she's doing. It would reflect badly on you to support your child and be vocal about her doing that, especially with the way society sexualizes parental relationships. \n\nNo one wants that for their child regardless, and most sane parents would not encourage and support it.
