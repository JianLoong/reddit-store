If you haven't read his comments, he mentions the funeral was for his sister, BIL and BIL's sister. I can't imagine the pain your family is facing right now and all I can tell you is to hold on, and take however much time you need to heal.\n\nThe reason I'm not saying N A H is because I think the wife is acting pretty selfish here. The SIL was with her. At 3 months, OP's wife should understand how important it is for OP to attend this funeral. This isn't living it up in Las Vegas.\n\nAlso OP mentions in comments wife and baby are both healthy, wife doesn't have PPD or signs of anxiety. She just doesn't want OP to go on a trip without her. Again, this is not a fun vacation, I'm sure OP would rather this tragedy never happened so he wouldn't even need to attend a funeral.\n\nI absolutely agree your priority, **in usual circumstances**, should be your wife and baby. This is far from that.\n\nOP and his wife are growing their family with the addition of their baby daughter, maybe they'll have another baby in the future, a lot of hopes and dreams to come.\n\nOn the other side, there's a massive hole where OP's sister's family was. This was the chance to say goodbye to the dreams they lost and the hopes that will never come true.", "NTA. It was a funeral, not a fishing trip. And it was 3 days.  \n\nHaving a baby means that sometimes you have to take care of it alone for a variety of reasons. And in this case your SIL came to babysit your wife and child.", "As the new mother of a 4month old, NTA. It was 3 days. Yes it\u2019s important that you support your wife but this was for a family funeral, not a boys trip to Vegas.", "NTA - This wasn't a planned trip or something that could be postponed to a later date. It was a funeral. It's unfortunate that it happened when it did but I think your wife needs to be a bit more understanding. Life doesn't stop just because you had a baby.", "NTA.\n\n>She didn\u2019t want me to go either and said I should be spending time with her and our daughter, and once she's a little older we can all go visit my family.\n\nHere's the thing: it's a funeral. Your wife is acting like you\u2019re going to a family barbaque; when in reality you\u2019re attending a funeral\n\n>My wife is mad at me and said it was selfish of me to go, and my priority should be them right now\n\nYour wife sounds controlling, using your daugher as a means to get what she wants from you. This was your final chance to say goodbye to that family member and mourn them; but your wife thinks your feelings and mourning is less important than staying home? \n\nI bet this wouldn\u2019t fly with her if someone from her family tragically passes away. I have no doubts she would refuse to skip the funeral and leave y\u2019all daughter with you at home", "NTA.  \nThe baby is small, but not super tiny, and at a good point in the \u2018learning how to manage babies\u2019 timeline.   \nA family funeral is a rare time for many people to fly in from all over, and share family history, connect and reaffirm their relationships with each other, and share their common loss. It\u2019s an unrepeatable event.", "NTA. No matter in what mental state she is right now, you found someone to come in and help her.\n\nAttending a funeral is NOT putting your family before your wife and kid. Your wife and kids are not dying or in immediate need of you. \n\nAttending a funeral is a critical part of the grieving process, for you and for people around you. You NEEDED to be there. If your wife can't understand that, she is selfish.", "NTA\n\n\nYou went to a funeral not a weekend away with the lads.", "NTA. The funeral isn't going to wait for your baby to be a little older, and funerals aren't about the baby or your family meeting the baby. The funeral is to honor the person who died and help you and your family begin to move through your grief. Your wife is being incredibly cold towards your loss, especially considering your child is already 3 months old. At this point, being away less than three whole days, especially while your wife has help with the baby, is entirely reasonable. It would be reasonable even if it were something mundane like a work trip. Your wife is being TA here.", "NTA for going to a (I'm assuming) close relatives funeral. Like other said, the baby is 3 months old. Y'all have had plenty of time to get into a routine on how to take care of the baby. Most working mother's go back to work by that time. She also had someone to stay with her so she wasn't completely alone and not everyone has that. \n\nI'm sorry to say, but your wife and SIL are the AH in this situation. She sounds very selfish.", "NTA. The only selfish one is your wife.", "NTA. A funeral for a loved one,  especially if you were only going for three days, is a totally valid excuse to travel even when there is a newborn in the house. It's not like you were leaving her to go on a trip to Vegas.", "NTA - 3 days is hardly an ask to attend the funeral of someone who clearly means a lot to you and your family. I'm sure there's enough emotions there without your Wife and SIL adding guilt on top.   \n\n\nAnyway, sorry for your loss and I hope the funeral goes as well as it can.", "Strong, strong NTA. The world still turns after you have a baby and if you haven't left your wife's side in 3 months you've done more than most. Acknowledging your family and attending to a family tragedy does not mean you are not committed to your wife and daughter, it just means you are still also part of a larger unit that I'm sure also cares for your wife and daughter, and she shouldn't be offended by that.", "NTA. Your wife was unsupportive about your loss. The baby is 3 months old, it\u2019s not a newborn and she should be able to handle her for less than 3 days\u2026 plus, her sister is there to help her. Definitely NTA", "NTA. She had support and your baby is 3 mos old, not 3 days. And I\u2019m a mom who exclusively BF two babies.", "NTA.  The baby is 3 months old, not 3 days old.  They will be fine without you for 3 days.", "NTA\n\nWhen someone close to you dies it's pretty important to be able to grieve and have closure and going to a funeral is part of that for a lot of people.\n\nYou said your SIL stayed with your wife while you were gone so she had family support while you were away. Unless there is something you are leaving out in all this I can't see how you were in the wrong.", "NTA\n\nUnless you're massively missing something out (e.g. your wife is seriously ill) I can't understand how anyone could begrudge you attending a family funeral. Especially since your wife had her SiL to help with the baby anyway so wasn't alone.", "NTA \n\nYou obviously lost someone close to you and had every right to go to the funeral. It was hardly a fishing weekend with the boys.", "NTA but your wife is extremely controlling is manipulative. It\u2019s not like she just had a baby the day before. And she had help, she was not left alone either.", "NTA I\u2019m assuming that this was a very close relative. You need to be in two places at once and since nowhere in your post does it say that you can do that, you were in the right. She had help, the baby is three months old. My husband traveled for business by the time ours were 2 weeks old, and I didn\u2019t expect him to stay home. She\u2019s just being dramatic.", "NTA\n\nI had a similar situation when my oldest was a month old. Fortunately my wife was much more supportive (and I also was only gone for a day; fly up for the wake, one overnight, go to the funeral, fly back).\n\nYour situation hits a lot harder than mine did, and in no way did you do anything wrong here. Your wife should not be pissed about you understandably needing to grieve.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NTA- \n\nThis was OP's sister and her husband. It was obviously an unexpected and tragic loss. I think he should have gone if the baby was 3 weeks old. \n\nI don't understand how so many people decided to hitch their lives to people who can't see past their own nose but I would be horrified by my husband's selfishness if this was me.", "NTA. It was a funeral, your wife had help, the kid is 3 months old. Your wife is the selfish one.", "NTA \n\nHonestly, doesn\u2019t matter what Reddit thinks because your wife seems to think you\u2019re an AH. The question is why... what exactly is it that she needed/wanted you to do in those 3 days? Ask her. Then explain things from your perspective. You were not choosing anyone else over your wife & child. You were choosing you. This was important for you. \n\nIf she believes you are selfish for functioning as an individual (you are not just a husband & dad) you have bigger problems than this trip. Partners support each other in challenging times, this was not a good look for your wife. You needed her to be part of the solution. She was part of the problem. \n\nedit\n\nETA \u2014 my FIL passed away very suddenly when our kids were little (4, 2, 6 mos twins) We all travelled to the funeral & my family came from different states to help manage our kids so I could support my husband. My sister drove my kids & I home while my husband stayed to help his Mom. It was kind of chaotic & a little crazy but that\u2019s what families do. Support each other. I am very sorry for your loss. I wish you & you family peace & comfort during this difficult time.", "NTA, it was OP\u2019s sister funeral , with brother in law + his brother. It\u2019s understandable that he wants to be there and not when the child is older.", "NTA. Your wife had two options: come with you to the funeral, or stay home. She chose to stay home. She has no right to say you can\u2019t go to your own sister\u2019s funeral. Your daughter is 3 months old, that\u2019s no longer newborn, and unless there was a medical reason not to travel, there is no reason she couldn\u2019t come with you. Your wife is being manipulative here - you need to stand up to her and make sure she knows you won\u2019t be played that way. I would be willing to lay money on if it were her family member who had died, she\u2019d be on the next plane out. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your losses.", "NTA at all, you lost your family went through a terrible tragedy. Losing your sister is hard enough on it's own, but to lose her, your BIL, & their sibling in go means something truly tragic took place. \n\nYour wife had her Sister with her, the fact that she tried to keep you from mourning your sister is beyond selfish. She should be supporting you during this, not making it more difficult. I'd start marriage therapy asap because this is something that can end a relationship.", "NTA from what you explained here.  It feels like there are missing reasons as to why she was so upset (can you not afford the trip?  PPD issues?) but from what you explained, you aren't wrong here.", "Nta. Unless there's info you arent telling us, like the kid is severely medically disabled, you didnt do anything wrong by attending the funeral.", "NTA if this was the other way around and OP\u2019s wife lost her sister AND 2 other close family members at one time and the OP wouldn\u2019t want her to go even though he has someone helping him at home and is only alone for 3 days everyone would be having a field day on him. I would be damned if anyone tried to stop me from my sisters funeral", "NTA at all. But\u2026 is your wife displaying signs of extreme anxiety, particularly when you are gone? \n\nI ask because when I gave birth to my son, I had extreme postpartum anxiety (signs look much more different than women with PP depression). I was constantly on high alert, having panic attacks, and couldn\u2019t stand the idea of not having someone else around in case something were to happen to the baby.\n\nI didn\u2019t even realize I even HAD a clinical disorder because nobody really talks about postpartum ocd/anxiety, but it\u2019s a real thing and it\u2019s debilitating. \n\nEither your wife is being very selfish, or something else is going on and you both need to get to the bottom of it so she can seek help if she is sick.", "NTA obviously.  You kept it to 3 days and spent the time you needed to with loved ones after a loss.", "NTA. But you really should add in your post that it was your sister who died.  You went for a funeral not a social visit and if she doesn't understand that then she is a very selfish individual.", "NTA\n\nSince in your comments you mentioned what and who was involved here, and that your wife isn\u2019t suffering from ppd, this next statement is going to sound harsh..\n\nThere\u2019s no need to be up each other\u2019s ass 24/7   To have a healthy marriage you need separate interests.. that\u2019s WITHOUT a baby involved. Without. \n\nWith a 3 month old baby, and the fact you had her sister stay with her so you could go, then the remarks made by both of them upon your return was so far off base it\u2019s just wrong. I don\u2019t get it at all. Especially under the circumstances. \n\nNow, your wife wanted you to stay home with her because she CHOSE not to go to your SISTERS. FUNERAL and expected you to stay home too. That\u2019s so freaking selfish and wrong. What if the shoe was on the other foot?! Has she always been this clingy and needy? Because I\u2019d get into some family counseling asap if I were you both. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Your wife is extremely self centered and unsupportive. She is derailing your grief process by making this about her. Why should you miss your sisters funeral to spend time at home, when she is capable of taking care of the baby. Her and her sister are huge AHs. On top of your grief you have to worry about who is mad at you. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA. A funeral isn\u2019t a \u201ctrip\u201d. You lost someone close to you and should be allowed to mourn. \nYour wife had help and you weren\u2019t gone long. \n\n   You need to have a conversation with her once this all calms down. You need to make sure this was a one time thing and not a walking red flag. \nI am sorry for your loss.", "NTA but maybe your wife is having undiagnosed or unstated postpartum issues? This is the type of thing she should have agreed to as an emergency trip, especially since she had her sister's help while you were away. Maybe she is having emotional issues that made that decision impossible for her.", "NTA, you made sure your wife and child had someone who was available in case of an emergency. Funerals are usually unexpected and take place under less than ideal circumstances. If your wife is mature enough to be a wife and now a mother she should be mature enough to understand that this was extenuating circumstances and deal with it in a mature manner.", "NTA it was a funeral not a party. You did nothing wrong", "NTA - life shouldn't stop with a baby. One parent should be sufficient for looking after an infant as long as they aren't working.\n\nResentment can creep in if this happens.\n\nA 12 week old baby will hopefully be sleeping more, maybe almost through the night, and will never remember your absence for 3 days.", "NTA. People shouldn\u2019t be expected to miss funerals just because they are a new parent.", "NTA.  It's a FUNERAL, not a party, and deaths don't tend to always come at the most convenient time for the mourners.  You weren't going over there to have fun without her or see someone on the side; you were going there to mourn.", "NTA, I coped when my husband left a week after my child was born and he was gone for months (military) three days for a funeral is not a huge ask.", "NTA. I have 4 month old twins and my husband recently had to go away for a weekend, Fri-Sun. It was something mandatory for grad school and we knew about it months prior. Was it challenging being on my own with 2 infants? Yes. But my in laws did help out by bringing me dinner and caring for the babies in the evening so I could get a few things done. I got through that weekend just fine. You are not being selfish and your wife had help the entire time you were gone. You have nothing to feel guilt about.", "First off, I am sorry for your loss.  I am so tempted to say NAH.  Your wife wants you around to help with an infant, that is understandable especially if she has been ill physically or mentally from having a child.  On the other hand it could be seen as awfully  extremely controlling or manipulative.\n\nYou however are in no way TA.  Your torn between taking time away from your wife, and infant, to attend a funeral, and lets remember a funeral is our last chance we get to say our good byes to those we love, and will miss.\n\nAgain I am sorry for your loss.", "INFO\n\nWhat is your home situation?  Do your wife and baby have specific and/or special needs?  I think that your wife wanted you to make sure their needs were your priority, and it is not clear whether or not you did.  Whether or not you are the AH depends on that.\n\nHaving said all that, depending on your relationship with the person whom you lost, I can understand your desire to go this far out of your way to attend the funeral, and I can also see that if things are stable at home and there is support (which there was), that things can be held down for a short period of time.  Main question from my point of view is where your priorities were.", "NTA. My husband traveled for work for 5 days when my son was two months. Of course we wanted him home, but he was doing what he had to do to support our family. Single moms hack it alone from day one (I don\u2019t know how, they are incredible) \u2014 a wife can be understanding and support her husband in his grief for a few days. I don\u2019t think your wife is being fair. Becoming a parent doesn\u2019t erase our individual identities, our need to grieve, have leisure time, and perform certain duties. Your wife had her sister\u2019s support. Maybe offer her a day trip to get a manicure a weekend away if she wants to see that you are willing to tackle parenting your newborn alone, too (although she wasn\u2019t alone).\n\nTo be fair though, the newborn days are a nightmare. How is everyone sleeping? Are you pulling your own weight at home? Have you told your wife you are proud of her and value all that she does everyday, including when you had to be away? Maybe time to talk, reconnect, and evaluate where everybody is at and if your new family dynamics are working for all of you. See if sis will babysit for a few hours after bedtime so you two can hash this out. Having a baby is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done and my husband and I wouldn\u2019t survive without a fuck ton of communication, affection, and honesty.", "NTA.  It would be one thing if the baby was 3 days or even 3 weeks old but the baby is now 3 months old and it\u2019s a funeral not a guys get away.  She had someone to stay with her so all worked out considering the circumstances.", "NTA - like others have said, it was a funeral, not a fishing trip.  It's not like you left her alone, she had her sister there.  \n\nMy daughter was about 3 *weeks* when my exBIL died. ExH went to the funeral (a 12 hour flight, btw) with my blessings.  I stayed with my parents for the week.  I was fine.  Daughter was fine.  ExH got to mourn with his family.  Now, exH's brother whose wife was due to deliver any day didn't go, but that was a totally different conversation.", "I see both sides. Your newborn should be your priority, absolutely.

Do not sweep this newfound knowledge under the carpet.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, and I'm so sorry that you've just discovered you're married to a selfish asshole who doesn't give a shit about you.", "NTA you were attending a family funeral", "NTA", "\u201cAns once shes a little older we can all go visit my family\u201d \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a vacation?? It was a funeral?? I would understand if the baby was like 3 days old but 3 months?? NTA", "NTA! A triple family funeral for your sister and her husband? Plus husbands sister? NTA NTA! But your wife sure is! What a selfish and cruel reaction to your losses. My condolences.", "NTA\n\nHow is this even a debate. 3 days where she had help is no big deal esp for a FUNERAL. \n\nYour wife needs to understand that you are a parent but you are still a human and a person and a family member. This was a reasonable thing.", "NTA \n\nI actually never understood the whole thing about doing everything together. \nShe has no right being mad about you going to a funeral and saying you dont support them and they dont mean enough for you. You could just as easily be mad at her for not supporting you when you needed her, but you seem fine about going alone. \nIn my opinion she has some problems if she thinks you cannot care about other people, besides her and the baby. A funeral is for the living, not the dead, and its very important getting to say your goodbuyes and being with the rest of the family. \nIm so sorry for your loss. Hope things works out with the wife, that kind of drama is not needed when your grieving.", "NTA\nIt makes absolute sense that you would attend. And honestly, unless your wife is facing specific difficulties, she could go with you. Sorry for your loss.\n\nI travelled by car with my kids to see my parents when they were even younger than that. And I've travelled internationally with a 4 month old and an almost 2 year old FOR VACATION.", "Soft YTA\n\nI get why you wanted to go, but I agree with your wife in this situation. Your priority should be them. If your kid was even a toddler, I'd have said okay, but 3 months is a baby and your wife needs the help and support. She's literally recovering from carrying a human being for 9 months. I'm also curious, if you're comfortable sharing, who actually passed. Was it actually a close relative or a third cousin twice removed situation?\n\nShe and your baby daughter is your family now, remember that. Definitely not saying to ignore everyone else but you could've gone to visit your family a few months later, like your wife said. Call them the day of the funeral, there are other options. I can see this would be a difficult decision for you but I think this is one of those times you need to make a difficult decision.", "Your wife was unreasonable, certainly.  But, reason to one is not reason to another.  You'll have to make it back up to her somehow.  She may change her mind five years hence and apologise for being unreasonable.    Don't embarrass her -- just go with the flow.  That's marriage.", "Agreed, said by a Mother of a 7mo. I get the mother did not want to travel with the 3mo. I wouldn\u2019t either, especially not in flu season. There are a lot of virusses. My baby was real sick twice already without taking risks so I get travelling is a risk. But Op you could and should still go for the funeral.", "Or just an insecure first time mother anxious about being left alone for the first time. \n\nBut sure, let's go with controlling and relationship issues, because this is AITA so why the hell not. I'm sure we can shoe horn the patriarchy in there somewhere too.", "True that!!! She could have managed for three days i guess!", "It\u2019s a triple funeral for *his sister*, BIL (sister\u2019s husband), and BIL\u2019s sister.\n\nHe also got her sister to come stay with her and both she and the baby are overall happy and healthy. His wife is extremely heartless.", "Op\u2019s sister", "That was op\u2019s sister funeral and her husband\u2026.", "Just a note: if you put A- H in your post before N-T - A, the bot will count it as A - H", "She doesn't have anxiety from what I can understand (outside of the usual for first time parents) or indicative of PPD. She wanted me to stay because she thought I shouldn't be going on a trip without her (even if it's a funeral) and it apparently showed her that I don't value them", "My wife and baby are both healthy, there's no big issues. The funeral was for my sister, my brother in law and his sister.", "Maybe see OP's history chat first. \n\nHe lost his sister, BIL and BIL's sister. I think that counts as close relative. \n\nWife was incredibly selfish here. it is not even N A H.\n\nWhat type of a partner are you if you don't support your spouse in this difficult situation but make it about themselves and their feelings!\n\nNTA", "Per OP, he lost his sister, brother-in-law, and BIL's sister. Definitely a time to draw a line.", "He said the SIL came over and stayed with his wife while he was gone.", "OP said that SIL was available and stayed with the wife.", "Why? Why should he miss his sister's funeral when his wife had help while he was away? Her trying to push him to stay, and making this terrible situation harder is her being a bad partner.", "Are you really saying he should have missed his sister, his BIL, and his BIL sister funeral? His wife had her sister for support during those three days.", "This is maybe one of the most ridiculous things I've read in responses here. Parents should stay home together, ignoring the rest of the world, until their kid is a toddler? That's not healthy for individuals, marriages, or children, honestly.", "It was for OP\u2019s immediate family. Being a husband & dad doesn\u2019t change the fact that OP is also a son & a brother. This was not a difficult decision. His wife just chose to make it harder for OP. He made the right decision.", "The funeral was for his sister.. he has the right to get closure and grieve his own sister. \n\nOP\u2019s wife had support while he was gone.", "It was a funeral for his SISTER! What is wrong with you?! His selfish wife didn\u2019t want him to go to his sisters funeral. His sister!!! There\u2019s no excuse for that. None. Plus he got her help while he was gone. His wife and her selfish insecurities were disgusting.", "He lost his Sister & her family, and all he wanted to do is go to the funeral. & he has to make it up to her? She made a horrible tragedy even more difficult. Especially since her sister was able to stay with her while OP was gone. \n\nMarriage shouldn't be tit for tat but to me she's clearly the one who dropped the ball", "But she isn't being left alone. Her sister will be there.", "I can see insecure.  I can see her struggling with PPD, but she was;t alone.  She had SIL (her own sister?) with her.  \n\n3 months is not 3 weeks or 3 days.  I was back to work at 8 weeks for 4 of mine.  I know a lot of people who had less time.  So, OP's wife should have been able to work out some kind of routine - especially with her sister there.  \n\nOP was only gone 3 days.  2 travel days, and only 1 day with family.  OP isn't ever going to forget this.  Sometimes a spouse simply has to say, this sucks, but it is what it is, and we have to get through.  \n\nAnd, yeah, if it was the wife's family tragedy, I would totally expect OP to make it work so she could go to the funeral, even if it meant staying at home with the baby for a week, or camping in the hotel during the service.", "Anxiety & insecurity can be the reasons behind the actions but it still makes them controlling. Even with those feelings, OP lost his sister and her family. This is one of the times that a good partner should step up and make life easier not pile their own issues on you.", "I see that now. Honestly, makes it even worse to me on how the spouse reacted.", "Good to know! Thank you!!", "ooooh so she's just controlling.  \nThats much better....", "No your wife has anxiety and is also very selfish. I couldn\u2019t imagine doing that to my husband if he had to go to a funeral and I had my second baby a little over a week  ago.", "Valuing your family isn't a one way street - it's mutual support. Someone who valued you as a person would have worked out a way to be there for you - and your family. Allowing her sister to criticise you on top is... honestly I think she has some serious work to do to show she's a partner to you", "NTA. Those are some pretty important people and being with family during a funeral is good. Grief sucks and it is important to get some family/friends time in. I would never stop my husband from going to a funeral, even when our kiddo was a baby. Since you're both healthy and she had her sister to help I don't see why there is a problem. Being a parent is hard so I understand not wanting to do it alone but some things are pretty important and there are going to be times when both of you will have to be alone with your kid for a small stretch.", "NTA. If there's anyone being selfish, that would be your wife. She should be supporting you, not guilt tripping you when you're grieving. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nThat helps bring it into perspective a lot.  I'm sorry for your loss, and hope you and your wife iron it out.  You at least did not leave her by herself with the baby.", "Your wife couldn't understand why you would want to be at the funeral?? Wth, your wife is very selfish. Very sorry for your loss OP. I hope things get better for you.", "I hope you're doing well that is a terrible tragedy. You should add who the funeral was for in the OP. & schedule some marriage consoling her selfishness in the midst of a tragedy is staggering.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "I'm so sorry that something so terrible has happened in your family.  This must be a massive shock as well as a loss. Best wishes to you all.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. And I'm sorry that your wife is so selfish and unsupportive as you deal with such a loss. That's really messed up", "[deleted]", "I agree ... we had 4 under 4 (4,2&twins) it took me a little while to successfully get 4 out of the house in under 30 minutes by myself but my husband & I certainly were not going to stay in our house with them until they were toddlers! Dear lord... that\u2019s the recipe for madness! \n\nAlso, I have to say caring for a 3 mos old does not require 2 people. They really don\u2019t do anything but eat, sleep & poop. They are very cute but also pretty boring. I realize my experiences are not the same for everyone but that just needed to be said.", "He's already went to the funeral. Also 3 days for a trip you need to reach by plane is near the minimum if you want to attend the event. Fly in day 1, event day 2, fly out day 3. \n\nAlso OP's SIL stayed with the wife while he was gone. So she wasn't on her own.", "WTF?  I\u2019m obviously an idiot who hasn\u2019t had my coffee yet.  I did read very closely about the \u201cmassive tragedy\u201d and \u201cthe funeral\u201d singular, but must\u2019ve skipped right over those parts.\n\nDon\u2019t know how it happened but it did, apologies.\n\nEdit: deleted my post since it no longer applies since I **didn\u2019t read the damn question**.  Facepalming over here."]}
