I was nice about it at first and tried to brush it off hoping it would be a one off event, when i realized it wasn\u2019t, i approached my brother and explained the situation and asked if he\u2019d talk to her, he said yes, the problem didn\u2019t stop. \n\n\nfinally, i started locking my things up in my bedroom. today i was a bit frazzled and forgot to lock my bedroom door when i left. i get home after work and go to take a shower and realize my hair brush is gone, still trying to give the benefit of the doubt i check everywhere i could\u2019ve left it, no where. finally, i ask my brother if he\u2019s seen it and he replies that his gf took it home with her, honestly, i flipped. i screamed at him for letting her go into my room and through my stuff, his excuse was that she had forgotten one and must\u2019ve taken it home on accident. i call her and ask if she\u2019s seen my hairbrush, she says no, so i tell her i know she has it. the conversation goes back and forth a bit and finally ends with me screaming that she needs to get off her ass and finish high school and get a job instead of stooping so low as to repeatedly steal from people.\n\n\napparently afterwards she called my brother crying and said she\u2019s humiliated and too embarrassed to come back here, so he\u2019s furious at me, my mother got involved and said hairbrushes are only a few dollars so i should\u2019ve just bought a new one instead of embarrassing his girlfriend like that. \n\n\ni do feel bad for yelling, i try not to be an angry person, but it really felt like enough was enough.

Your brother owes you big money for things his GF stole or used without permission. It's your stuff not his stuff he can get off his arse and buy his GF these things. And you are not \"freaking out over a brush\" you are reacting to his constant disrespect for what is your property. He needs to understand that these things costs money and what she is doing is free loading off of you. Also she's not coming over not because she's humiliated she's not coming over because she knows she can't steal anything more.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't freak out about a hairbrush. You freaked out about someone stealing from you again after you thought you had finally stopped them. You had every right to freak out, and I'm guessing that, while the brush might have only been a few dollars, the makeup, hair products, food, and clothing probably brought the total stolen to hundreds.\n\nAt least now, she says she won't be coming back to the house, so win/win! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "NTA she should be too embarrassed to come back there. I'd be embarrassed too if I mooched and stole from my bf's family. Since hairbrushes are so cheap, I suggest your mom give her her own hairbrush. One thing broke b****es have more than enough of, is the *audacity*", "NTA. She should be humiliated. Who steals feminine hygiene products, shower stuff, and brushes? From her boyfriend\u2019s sister at that? Does she not have parents?", "NTA. That your mother would defend your brother's gf riffling through your stuff and helping herself to whatever she feels like stealing is especially appalling. Mothers should know better.", "NTA\n\nYou yelled and she got upset. Well everyone just needs to grow up here. She should stop being so immature and plan her trips to your place better and bring with her what's required. She should defiantly ask before borrowing, using or taking stuff. I would not stand for this and call it out. You go girl for sticking up for yourself. I hate getting had !", "NTA. Yeah, that crazy of his gf to act like your stuff is hers for the taking. I mean was this down to using allllllll of your clothes? As in, did she even bring her own underwear.? And ask your brother if he's really okay sleeping with a gal who dresses like his sister (because it's your clothes) and smells like you (because it's your shower stuff) and is she trying to do a spell on you or something because she took your hairbrush with your hair on it (mostly joking about this one.... but seriously).", "NTA. It's not just about the brush, your brothers GF sounds like a clepto.", "NTA, the hairbrush wasn't a one-off thing. Also the hairbrush is not even the point, the point is that she went into a bedroom that was _clearly_ off limits to her and stole items. I'm sure you wouldn't have cared if she was a person who never stole and just took it home one time by accident. But you've held off on embarrassing her so that your brother could deal with her privately, but he didn't. And honestly if brother thinks its \"just a few bucks\" ask him to pay for everything she's stolen from you till now.", "NTA\n\nAnd it's good that she's 'humiliated and too embarrassed to come back'. She's either too entitled or has mental issues. Or both.", "NTA\n\n> she\u2019s humiliated and too embarrassed to come back here\n\nGreat!", "Your brother\u2019s girlfriend is practically living at your mom\u2019s house and stealing from you on a regular basis. That tells me that your mom is either a narcissist (you\u2019re the scapegoat and your brother is the golden child) or your mom has no faith in your brother\u2019s ability to find a woman and is just happy he found someone. \n\nNTA. However, if I were you, I\u2019d move out. This is an incredibly dysfunctional situation. The girlfriend isn\u2019t even of age, so there\u2019s that. You need to remove yourself from these people.", "NTA in the slightest bit.", "NTA. She deserved it.", "NTA\n\nBut I genuinely wonder why she's stealing so much food and hygiene products...? Is she really that cheap, or is there some neglect/abuse (even financial abuse) going on at home?\n\nEither way it's your stuff, you paid for it and especially now it can get quite expensive. I would have lost it too.", "NTA\n\nTell him his birthdag/Christmas present is not making him pay back all the stuff she stole. Or write a list up and start selling his stuff to pay for replacements.

She will be back eventually, so just keep an even face, don't get into direct confrontations anymore, she can put your family against you apparenty cause everyone in your family agrees with burglary.
