I was gone 10 days and less than 1/4 of each was left and this girl's hair was shorter than mine).  My mother called me a bitch for being pissed off about it because she had told her to \"make herself at home\", then yelled at me for spending so much of her money to replace the stuff she took and taking my dog to the vet to get her checked (we caught the bronchitis flare early, the vet blamed the flare on her not getting the prednisone), so I didn't talk to her for two months.
