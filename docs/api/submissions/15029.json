Sounds like you and Dan need to reestablish boundaries. You are either friends with benefits thing or just friends. If \u2018just friends\u2019 then no flirting, no sexual innuendos etc because that shit gets confusing fast.", "Damn... an incel that already got some from you? Holy shit, that's a new one.\n\nNTA", "NTA I would say lots of people have used him for his boat and you hit a nerve. He still has no right to treat you like that if you\u2019ve never taken advantage of him.", "NTA Dan has been used for his boat. You haven\u2019t used him because you were never on the boat. Talk to him and ask him straight out where that comment came from.", "Nta- Im wondering if his boat causes him headaches and your flirty comment just hit him at the wrong time.  There's an old saying about owning a biat- the 2 best days of owning a boat are the day you buy it and the day you sell it.", "NTA and it sounds like maybe the friendship needs some distancing.", "NTA.\n\nI wonder if something else is going on or if this was typical behavior of ex-gf and his comment was misplaced - really about her and should have been directed to her - but your joking comment touched a nerve?\n\nEither way, a follow up convo is appropriate.  \n\nNo more flirting comments like this tho.  If you want to keep the friendship, maintain boundaries.  \n\nThat you hang out or talk daily, makes me wonder if you are in a surrogate bf/gf relationship where you each are getting emotional intimacy you would normally get in a romantic relationship, whether you realize it or not.  And yes, I do believe men & women can be friends without romantic entanglement - but many folks dont think that way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Find someone that\u2019s fun and enjoys time with you.  Not this head trip of Infusion.  Life is short.", "NTA. You were just flirting and he took it the wrong way. You offered to help him and he refused which isn't your fault. You're not the asshole here.", "I don't know how many girls he had on that boat, but as you have not been one of them, NTA\n\nWhy should you be obligated to help out if he has never even invited you?", "NTA - Dan is an adult. His comment was petty - especially because you have never been on the boat in the first place! He needs to decide if he is annoyed about people taking advantage of his boat (which has to be other people, because again, in three years he has never even invited you on the boat) or if he is upset about his relationship with you. If he is not happy with the current state of your relationship, he needs to speak up and say that. If this is about other people, he shouldn't take that out on you.", "NTA - he sounds like it though, paranoid", "Not the asshole.\n\nThat \"first one to help gets a ring\"? That was a clue as to who gets that label.", "Nta what do you see in a guy who treats you like an annoyance and an obstacle?", "NTA\n\nI'm confused too.\n\nSounds like he just wants to reinstate the benefits.", "If you have never stepped foot on his boat I really can\u2019t see you being the AH.", "NTA. I mean, I'm thinking what you're thinking: what's the problem here? You said something that was a) pretty obviously a joke, and b) never actually something you did. Just don't let this incident ruin a very lovely bond you two have.", "Nta, he's not entitled to your help. But are you sure he wasn't just joking with the using you comment? It sounds like something I'd say sarcastically.", "I\u2019m actually going with ESH for these same reasons. Dan is weird about his boat and has some major hang ups re the ex, but OP is being weird about Dan. If she\u2019s not FWB with Dan anymore, and not intending to renew the benefits (will be hard after being friends, could easily slip into gf territory), then she should stop having NSFW convos with this dude and he\u2019s entitled to get confused given she engages in those (she\u2019s being actively confusing).", "That\u2019s a really good point!", "Hahhahaa this made me actually lol. In my defense I didn\u2019t realize it at the beginning", "Who said I didn\u2019t? Lol.", "Which I wasn\u2019t opposed to reinstating the benefits, but not when being treated like this. I mean I\u2019m flirting too it\u2019s not a one way street with that.", "Assuming you haven't left off any details (I always check), his behavior is definitely a red flag and it's a good thing you're not dating him any longer.\n\nFor what it's worth, a man rarely responds the way this guy did unless there's some odd sexual frustration. Is he resentful of the fact you two aren't going at it anymore?", "So on one hand you're Implying you still would have sex with him and on the other you're agreeing he's an incel?\n\nYea YTA", "I think we always assume it\u2019s the girl who feels used in a FWB situation but it makes me wonder if he has more than just sexual feelings for you. It would explain why he reacted the way he did and it then makes me go hard on the boundaries and a conversation thing. \n\nIt\u2019s been three years, you are either just friends or girlfriend and boyfriend. Dragging it out any longer will see both of you getting hurt.", "I definitely watered down the story so it wasn\u2019t a novel, but did not leave out the important points. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s resentful, but I\u2019m definitely willing to. Lol. I\u2019ve made it known that I\u2019m okay with picking back up the fun parts", "got it", "Right?! Like I'm feeling as if there's definitely some missing info...is his boat his penis? Idk...", "...uh... then his behavior is REAL weird. Again, I can only go off what you've told me but... the fuck?\n\nBack in my adorable incel religious days when I was a teenager, I'd only get upset at women for feeling used when I was into them and giving too much, thinking it would earn me a kiss. I absolutely do not understand his angle, and it's so bizarre it's worth asking him about it and trying to get him to spill his guts.\n\nIf you ever find out, I want to know. I'm utterly confused, but ya... not long-term dating material. (At least not yet.)", "Yeah that makes two of us. I think he\u2019s projecting anger for someone else onto me? I wasn\u2019t opposed (at the time) to picking back up the benefits, hence the flirting. But this was just wild to me"]}
