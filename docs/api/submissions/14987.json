My [25M] neighbor [20s-30s?F] and I each both have quite large plots of lands and two story houses.

It\u2019s also where my guests and I hang out most often. My neighbor likes to garden, but physical activity apparently drains her so badly she can\u2019t stay awake?? I\u2019m honestly skeptical as to how this works. Most of the time she makes it to a hammock but when she doesn\u2019t it\u2019s extremely startling to see a woman lying in the grass. She usually wakes up after 10-20 minutes and goes right back to gardening, only to take another nap in about an hour. \n\nWhen we moved in she warned us while introducing herself, but I\u2019ve made several gentle suggestions (such as leaving a door open so it\u2019s easier for her to make it inside, moving her garden plots closer to her home, or even expressing concern that her hobby is detrimental to her health) over the months and she\u2019s ignored each one. I can\u2019t help but feel like she\u2019s doing it for attention. She did have some netting installed that helps a little (for her fruit trees) but I\u2019m still tired of having that split second reaction to thinking I\u2019m seeing a corpse outside on any given day. \n\nMy friends have basically told me to mind my own business.

It often happens in these cases that you genuinely don\u2019t know when you are getting close to your limits, and when you come up with an empty tank you are suddenly hit by a wall of fatigue that is intense enough to rob you of most coherent thought. Your body is telling you that you must stop. Now. No negotiation or delay permitted. You WILL rest. It may well be that your neighbour is dealing with something like this.\n\nSource: both myself and my partner live with autoimmune conditions that carry this effect.
