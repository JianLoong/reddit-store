{"id": 20652, "submission_id": "14ji3as", "title": "AITA for calling the police and getting a bike towed?", "selftext": "Hi, I'm a 24F and I'm the owner of a bar in Spain. Here, the owners of bars can make a contract with the town hall to rent a place on the street to put up a terrace, it's something we pay for. It is not much different to renting a parking space, that space is 'ours' for the duration of the contract. \n\nToday when I opened the bar I saw that there was a motorcycle parked in my terrace zone, since it was 7 o'clock and I can't put the terrace up until 9 I didn't do anything. But the hours went by and no one came for the motorcycle, it was 9 o'clock and it was still there.\n\nAfter nine o'clock I began to get impatient, several clients were asking me when I am going to put the terrace because they like to have their coffee outside. I talked to several customers and no one knew who the motorcycle belonged to, and with no way to contact the owner at 10am I called the police. \nIn less than 20 minutes a tow truck took the motorcycle away and I was finally able to place the tables and chairs outside. A while later, around 11am, a man in his 30s appeared and asked what happened to his motorcycle, I told him I called the police and that it was towed. \n\nThat man looked at me as if I had stolen something from him and started swearing under his breath saying that getting it back is going to cost him more than 200 euros, etc. Should I have waited longer? \n\nSeveral customers said that I should have called the police sooner, others that I could have waited a while longer and that 200 euros is not a small amount in this economy. What do you think?\n\nTL: Someone parked a motorcycle in the place I rent to put some tables and chairs in front of my bar so I got it towed.\n\nEdit: The zone is marked with yellow paint which means no parking here (Lots of people asked about that). Thanks to all for your responses, it helped ease my guilt. I know how 200 euros can really screw a family monthly budget so that made me feel bad for him but as you guys said: He parked illegaly and knew it so its on him.", "created_utc": 1687787940, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ji3as/aita_for_calling_the_police_and_getting_a_bike/", "score": 222, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He parked illegally and is now acting like it's your fault he owes 200 euros. It is his own fault. He was negatively impacting your business, you allowed more than enough time.", "NTA\n\nIt was illegally parked and left there for hours. You had no way to contact the owner. Not being able to open the terrace on time cost you money. What else could you possibly have done? Getting it towed was the only solution for you.\n\nHe is the ah and deserved the fine.", "NTA\n\nHowever...you might inquire as to getting a sign so you can post that the area is a terrace area and not public parking", "NTA - People who park illegally always get mad that someone didn't come find them.  I'd have had it towed at 9 am.", "NTA\n\nHonestly if it\u2019s pretty common for all the zones to be marked in yellow paint and the guy didn\u2019t know he either thought it didn\u2019t matter or didn\u2019t care enough to figure out what the paint meant if he was from out of town or a tourist. If that spot is yours per the duration of the contract then he\u2019s so outta luck on that one, and you were just operating within your power under said contract to support your customers.", "NTA.

Hopefully the selfish dumbass learns from this and doesn't park where he shouldn't.", "NTA", "INFO - Is the space clearly marked \"No Parking after 9pm. Vehicles will be towed\" ?\n\nEdit: I just read the answer in another comment.\n\nYTA - yellow paint on the asphalt is not a good sign. A clear written sign protects the pubic. And it would have made things easier when the guy showed up.

He was illegally parked  and you require that space for your business. How much money would you have lost if you could not use that space? You don't need to answer. The point is that you are running a business and he was costing your money. The bike had to go!", "NTA, look up parking wars it's an American series you will find 99% of the time everyone is illegally parking and cursing out the people writing tickets for DOING THEIR JOB.", "NTA.  You waited too long.  You should've called sooner than 9 since that's the time you open up the tables.  Him having his bike parked there is potentially taking away customers causing you to lose money.  He can read & chose to park his bike there anyway.  You did nothing wrong.  You have a business to run & his motorcycle was in the way.", "NTA, as long as there was a sign there explaining that he wasn't allowed to park there.", "Well maybe 9:03.", "The zone is marked with yellow paint. All terrace zones in my town are marked with yellow paint.", "Wherever they are yellow on the ground apparently is a clear \u201cNo parking\u201d indication.

I'm envisioning the area sanctioned off by the paint with yellow diagonal slashes--if that isn't enough to indicate to you that you shouldn't park there then you deserve to be towed.

What did they do to deserve any break after already breaking the law?", "If the yellow paint is enough to indicate the equivalent of a No Parking sign, then NTA, he gambled by parking in a no parking zone, and he lost.", "Is that the standard indication of no parking? Sorry I'm not from Spain so I don't know. If that is the standard \"no parking\" signage/indication NTA.

Guy took a risk parking there and it didn't work out for him.", "then his problem", "Yellow curbs in Spain mean the same as red curbs in the US--\"no parking any time\".", "Yes, the yellow paint is standard in Spain and many other European countries. Many places in the US also use yellow paint to mark no-parking zones. In my city, they use red for fire zones (near hydrants or the curb in front of a store where a firetruck would park) and yellow for any other no-parking zones (loading zones, two feet from street corners, etc.). There is also sometimes signage, but you're correct that the paint is sufficient since you're supposed to know the rules of the road.", "Thanks! OP is NTA", "Yes I'm used to yellow meaning \"no parking\" or \"no parking unless xyz\" . Since yellow means no parking the guy took a risk parking there and it didn't work out for him. Not OP's fault.", "INFO\n\nHow did he know right off the bat that it would cost more that 200 euros?

Was there a way to know he couldn't leave his bike there?", "INFO: Something is left missing from your story: what are your city's regulations, and are they publicly visible as they should be?\n\nDid the person disregard a \"no parking\" zone?\n\nIt sounds suspicious that you have a whole **contract** for your terrace, yet you have to dismantle it overnight? Does that contract include the rights to remove people legaly parked in that space?", "NTA. You were nice and gave him some time to retrieve his motorcycle.", "NTA.  Motorcyclist here.  I could see being upset if I did not know that was a reserved spot because if it is unmarked, but it is still up to him to know what is and isn\u2019t acceptable.", "My first instinct is NTA, but I have questions. \n\nIs the area marked off that it is for your business use, or a NO Parking sign, or some other indication that he should not have parked his motorcycle there?", "NTA\n\nHe claims about the fine he's having to pay, but how about your lost income? \n\nAnd he didn't show up until 11? He deserves no sympathy. He's lucky you waited until 10am.", "NTA and you know it. Parking de motos exist for a reason, and it's forbidden to park in the pavement (only exceptionally allowed in very wide (+5m) pavements and if they don't impede the foot traffic. Parking a moto in front of a bar in Spain is an asshole move, they all (with veeeery fee exceptions) have terrasses, specialty since Covid.", "That is aprox what costs to recover a bike/car that was towed. Little over 100 euros is the standard fee and then you have to pay a plus for the time it was stored in the Tow company parking (that depends on the company, it can be 20 euros a day or more). So the total its aprox 200 euros. Of course if the police fines you its more. Idk if the police fined him.", "Yeah, yellow paint.", "We use yellow in Canada too.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t care that he could cause you to lose money by not being able to use your terrace. He broke the law and has to pay the consequences.", "Next time don\u2019t say you called the police and had it towed. You simply say I don\u2019t know or that it was towed by the city. \n\nCurious if there was a sign around after hours informing the no parking\u2026.how would someone know it was rented if the tent wasn\u2019t up or signs", "NTA. Don\u2019t waste energy feeling bad. I used to live where we had a driveway from our garage under our house and people would park in front blocking us in. In our city you could call for a tow which would cost about $300 US to get the vehicle back, or just request a ticket which would be about $75. People would throw tantrums over the tickets (we would hear them below our window and sometimes they would bang on our door, usually at 2:00 AM when the bars closed. We stopped being nice and just started having them towed.", "NTA, part of being an adult is paying parking/towing fines if you park somewhere you shouldn't \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. He knew the rules.  If he didn't want to spend an extra 2k eruos, he should have moved his bike.", "NTA. He was well aware of what he did. He even knew how much the fine was. Entirely on him.", "Nta. If it was marked no parking he took the risk parking there.", "The paint on the curb indicating it\u2019s not a parking area isn\u2019t enough?", "Well if he didn\u2019t want to pay all those fines, he should\u2019ve thought about that before he parked his motorcycle illegally. Sure he has to pay money, but he didn\u2019t care that his illegally parked motorcycle was costing you money. (Money that you need to pay for your family, the cost of running a business and having employees and renting a space). You were losing money by not getting his bike towed sooner. And I can guarantee that he didn\u2019t give one single flip about any of that. Even if you hadn\u2019t gotten it towed and continued allowing him to cost you money, he wouldn\u2019t have cared about how his actions were negatively impacting you as long as he got what he wanted. (Which he could\u2019ve gotten by parking legally in the first place.)\n\nSo no, don\u2019t feel bad about towing his motorcycle. He didn\u2019t feel bad about costing you money by having his motorcycle parked in your business space."]}
