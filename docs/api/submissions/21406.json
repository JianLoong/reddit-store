As a result, you can always tell when she was the last one to use to the bathroom because it reeks of pee. The first few times we hung out was at my house and I legit thought our toilet wasn\u2019t flushing properly. The first time I went to her house and needed to use the bathroom not long after her, it clicked what the source of the smell was because it hit me like a Mack truck as soon as I went near the bathroom.\n\nOnce I worked out it was her pee, I started suggesting we go out to do things instead of hanging out at each others houses because I didn\u2019t want to say something and embarrass her. I also started pushing her to drink water because I really do enjoy hanging out at home with her playing video games and I was worried she\u2019d get kidney stones again, but she always declined it.\n\nShe called me earlier today and asked if I wanted to come over and hang out tonight, but I declined and suggested dinner at a local cafe instead.

My husband got home an hour or so after she left and he\u2019s actually the one who brought it up, I hadn\u2019t noticed it because I hadn\u2019t been in the bathroom since she used it.\n\nI have air freshener in my bathroom, which I used, but after that smell went away the pee smell lingered. I also tried Febreze and the same thing happened.\n\nAfter the second time it happened, I thought it might have been an issue with my bathroom so I asked my landlord to send out a plumber to check everything and he confirmed there were no issues.\n\nA lot of people have also brought up that she may have had asparagus, but my husband loves asparagus and eats it a few times a week.

I will say, adding Mio to change up the flavor is really helpful for me.

Instead of recommending a change in their diet, you could have suggested that she may have a health issue that's causing the problem.  I don't think just drinking soda is causing it.

Just like my body is very bad at signaling that I'm getting hungry (and then suddenly I'm starving), my body doesn't do well at telling me I'm thirsty. I don't have this deep craving for water very often, and when I do it's only because I'm in the danger areas of approaching dehydration.

I used to love water, and then I moved somewhere with a high mineral content in their water, and I couldn't stand to drink it from the tap anymore.

There\u2019s lot of reasons pee can smell bad. It sounds like you are being judgmental and elitist. I hate using a bathroom after someone else myself, but that\u2019s what bathrooms are for.

I seek some sort of simulation as I feel understimulated and bored and I get \"hungry\" when really my mind just knows that eating will provide flavor and texture that will provide stimulation. Water for me is just the opposite of that, it's no real texture and the flavor is often enough just boring that I would rather gravitate towards things I know have a good flavor. Soda is best to be because strong flavor and texture, but juice/whole milk/tea/(thanks to my boyfriend) water with flavoring additives also work. But yea, water is typically my last choice XD", "Your alternatives have a butt ton of sugar, which is just as bad as the soda in its own way.

He started with a TON of regular sodas like sunkist and coke, then switched to a new brand that only does cane sugar and started drinking a lot less, and now he's onto tea. Really sugary tea, but still less sugar than the sodas and more water. He's recently been trying to move towards no sugar and only honey in the tea but he's not quite there yet.", "Learned avoidance! Rough business.", "No, you can always use flavor packets. They are 10 calories and zero sugar. \n\nThese aren't bad substitute options either. You are comparing them to just drinking straight water, which a lot of people simply will not do. Yeah, these options may have more sugar, but not nearly as much a 16 cans of coke will have. As a substitue for *soda* ? Almost any of these would be an improvement. \n\nI never was addicted to soda, I HATE the feeling of fizziness in my mouth and ever since I was a small kid I used to complain that it \"burned my throat\" when I swallowed. I still feel that way and the only time I drink soda is if I'm also drinking alcohol (I used to even chase with water \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but bars won't let you bring your own water bottles now.) even then it's a semi-flat white monster or 1/3 spite and 2/3rds cranberry juice. \n\nMy partner? Exact opposite, was hugely addicted to soda as a kid, we've been dating 3 years and he's just very recently upped his water intake by replacing the soda with tea. It's extremely sugary tea, but he's been making it at home so I know he's drinking at least a 1/4 gallon worth of water with that sugar a day. Is it as great as pure water? No! But is it WAY better than what he was doing before and am I seeing improvements? Yes! \n\nI hated soda, but I also reeeeaaallly liked juice and propel (I still like propel \ud83d\ude05). I found out that I needed to be drinking more water after a doctors visit, I had been drinking the reccomended amount, but they thought drinking a lot more would bring my blood pressure up to something more normal.  It was damn near impossible for me to muster down a gallons worth of flavorless water every day. It got to the point where I almost felt like I would be sick everytime I looked at the bottle. It usually ended up warm halfway through as well and nothing is worse to me than a warm drink. Some people really like water because they don't drink a lot of it at a time. My grandma was one of those people who only drank water, but it would be like 2 and a half cups throughout the whole day. Me? I was and am, not that kind of person. Those little zero sugar country time packets, or the crystal light ones? Saved. The. Day.\n\nI'll go through like 6-8 of those packets a day, and I like them watered down a bit.
