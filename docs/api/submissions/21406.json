I drink a lot of sparkling water, but your comment helps me appreciate the pov of people who don\u2019t like it.", "YTA here for making ASSUMPTIONS about her body and her health.", "YTA. You could have brought it up in a better way.\n\nAlso pee stinks like even if you drink only water. It smelled worse with caffeine but still. Don\u2019t act like yours don\u2019t stink cause it do", "AH!  Someone elses diet is none of your business.  Instead of recommending a change in their diet, you could have suggested that she may have a health issue that's causing the problem.  I don't think just drinking soda is causing it. My wife drinks coke like it's going out of style and her urine doesn't smell.  It's probably caused by her healthy food choices.  I know that eating asparagus (and a few other vegetables) can cause urine to to have a heavy odor.", "YTA. Do you make a fuss when someone poops at your house too?  That\u2019s also an unpleasant smell. I just truly don\u2019t understand why you care if the bathroom temporarily smells after someone uses it. Pretty strange.", "No, I would want someone to tell me. I hope she cools down and you guys make up and she drinks more water.", "This is absolutely absurd. YTA. Bathroom\u2019s all smell weird and bad, not going to someone\u2019s bathroom is psycho behavior, and that\u2019s coming from someone with severe germaphobia. Using other people\u2019s bathrooms always sucks, but just hold it or deal with it. Changing your entire social circle\u2019s routine over it is legitimately certifiable. You need help.", "YTA.  Do you also quiz everyone before they come to your house or you go to theirs to see if they had asparagus?  Get an air freshener.", "Her kidneys r getting WRECKED NTA", "Pee always smells bad, though?\n\nSlight YTA?", "NTA, but you should have thought before speaking.", "But does that strong smell linger after flushing? Assuming the bathroom is clean and no dried pee anywhere why would pee smell linger past the flush? Last time I drank coffee my pee was strong but the flush fixed the issue. Long lingering pee smell is strange.", "Oh, it's an extremely *sweet* smell?", "Kidney stones doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s the cause of the smell. My husband has kidney stones.  He drank a lot of soda. No smell issues there. He started drinking non-dark cola (and switched to Mountain Dew) which has helped with the stones. \n\nOP is assuming it is due to the soda because he has issues with it and the  friend. He is judging her based on his personal bias.  \n\nA lot of foods can cause urine to smell.  Asparagus. Broccoli.  Garlic. Onions. Brussel sprouts. Fennel.  Coffee. Dried fruit. Honey. Fish. Cumin. \n\nMedication can cause urine to smell. Same with infections. \n\nOP is the AH.", "Yeahhhhhh. This doesn't seem like just a \"her\" issue. Okay. Her pee smells. Don't go to her house. Invite her to yours and just deal with it for a little bit? I know how kidney stones makes pee smell. It ain't good, but it's survivable? Maybe you're really sensitive to smells and you need to get that evaluated? If she herself doesn't smell, and she isn't willing to change, and you want to be friends.. just hold your nose a little while?", "This is the first thing I thought of, (my roommate is diabetic).", "No, it smells like ammonia.", "Dehydration also causes smelly urine, and we know that OPs friend is so severely dehydrated she got kidney stones, so I think its a pretty safe assumption to make\u2026", "How much of these foods is she eating to cause her pee to smell like that?\n\nAnd she is not that healthy if she is dehydrated.\n\nShe needs a urinalysis to determine the state of her health.", "That\u2019s a myth.  Soda does not dehydrate you. It\u2019s just less efficient to hydrate with it than water. Kidney stones can form for reasons other than dehydration.", "How do you know she is dehydrated?  Kidney stones can form for reasons other than dehydration. How do you know she hasn\u2019t had a urinalysis?  She says she is healthy, aside from the soda thing.  You can be healthy and have smelly urine.", "Especially true of sodas made with corn syrup instead of cane sugar.", "I used to be like this, but like lots of things, seltzers are an acquired taste but once you acquire the taste they\u2019re awesome! (But I definitely do love the carbonation and need that fizz feeling on my throat, so maybe that\u2019s why I acquired the taste?)", "Genuinely asking: if you're not drinking it for the fizz, then is the sweetness the appeal? Could you switch to lemonade, sweet iced tea, boba milk tea?", "I dislike any flavored seltzer (not big on sodas generally). But there is plain carbonated water out there. I drink a ton of that.", "First of all I never said soda dehydrates you, I said she was dehydrated and got kidney stones as a result, as confirmed by her doctors. Argue with them if you want", "So, I had a long paragraph about what sensations I dislike and the non-flavor of water, but I realized while reading your question is that my body does not often alert me that I'm desperate for hydration. Just like my body is very bad at signaling that I'm getting hungry (and then suddenly I'm starving), my body doesn't do well at telling me I'm thirsty. I don't have this deep craving for water very often, and when I do it's only because I'm in the danger areas of approaching dehydration. And even then I like it cold with ice cubes in it, and can manage a bottle or a tall glass before being done. I don't like the lack of flavor, and the artificial fruit flavors taste way off most of the time. And I hate fizzy water with a passion.\n\nI used to joke that it was because I grew up in a desert and \"adapted\" to water availability, but I genuinely just think it's because I have no idea how to tell when my body needs something and I'm not good at forcing it to do things that are good for it but make me unhappy.", "Not the person you replied to, but! I used to love water, and then I moved somewhere with a high mineral content in their water, and I couldn't stand to drink it from the tap anymore. Then, the next place I lived had a brief contamination issue, and it created an aversion to it. I still drink it if I have to, but prefer to make myself tea or drink bottled seltzer."]}
