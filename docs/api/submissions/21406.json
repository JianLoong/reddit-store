She says she\u2019s healthy because she eats healthy and her parents were alcoholics so she doesn\u2019t drink alcohol (which I do commend her for since Australia has a big drinking culture), but she\u2019s addicted to soda instead, and never water. As a result, you can always tell when she was the last one to use to the bathroom because it reeks of pee. The first few times we hung out was at my house and I legit thought our toilet wasn\u2019t flushing properly. The first time I went to her house and needed to use the bathroom not long after her, it clicked what the source of the smell was because it hit me like a Mack truck as soon as I went near the bathroom.\n\nOnce I worked out it was her pee, I started suggesting we go out to do things instead of hanging out at each others houses because I didn\u2019t want to say something and embarrass her. I also started pushing her to drink water because I really do enjoy hanging out at home with her playing video games and I was worried she\u2019d get kidney stones again, but she always declined it.\n\nShe called me earlier today and asked if I wanted to come over and hang out tonight, but I declined and suggested dinner at a local cafe instead. She started asking why I never wanted to hang out at our homes any more and I danced around it a bit, but she kept pressing so I eventually told her \u201cBecause you don\u2019t drink water! Only drinking soda makes your pee\u2026 pungent. The smell lingers in the bathroom for a while.\u201c\n\nShe instantly got defensive saying she\u2019s healthy and I told her she wasn\u2019t going to stay healthy if she kept ignoring her GP and the doctors at the hospital who had told her she needed to start drinking more water or she\u2019d get kidney stones again. Then she said she doesn\u2019t smell, which I agreed with since she doesn\u2019t, but her pee does.\n\nShe wouldn\u2019t let up until I lost it and said \u201cThe bathroom smells like someone has been making rancid chicken cup noodles after you use it!\u201d which is when she essentially told me to go fuck myself and hung up on me.\n\nAITA for telling her about how bad her pee smells?

Not everyone has pleasant smelling bodily excretions.", "It may not be the soft drink she's drinking, it may be asparagus or something like that as well. And those reeds don't do anything! Buy the poo spray at Coles", "YTA. Urine can have bad smells for a variety of reasons including medications or supplements she may be taking or an undiagnosed medical condition.  Instead of thinking about that, you jumped to a conclusion based on nothing but your assumptions and instead of being sympathetic and conveying your concerns, you acted like she should know her urine has a strong smell and she didn\u2019t care. \n\nIf I were her, not only would I be embarrassed, but I would question why I thought you were friend material and whether or not I would even want to remain friends with someone who is not compassionate in situations like this.", "NTA.

That would make your pee stink but is easily treatable with antibiotics. Can also become dangerous if untreated for some time.", "My urine has a strong scent to it but I don't drink soda or alcohol.

You tried to handle it delicately, but I can also understand why she would be hurt and embarrassed.\n\nThere are other ways to deal with the smell though. Does her bathroom have air freshener? If it's just a lingering smell after she's flushed and the bathroom is actually clean, I would just give it a little spray. Or if necessary even carry something in my handbag to spray. VIPoo/the likes there of (if it's available in Aus) should do the trick if it prevents shit smelling. \n\nI completely get your concern over her kidney stones, especially if she's had them before, strong urine smell is a symptom and she should probably be checked out. She could be otherwise asymptomatic atm. But you cannot make an adult look after themselves unfortunately and I wouldn't say it's worth losing a friend over. \n\nYou're a good friend who tried their best to avoid embarrassment and attempt to get her to look after herself a little better. It's just shitty how it all blew up and had to come out", "NTA. You tried really hard to be gentle about it until she kept on going.

Do you also tell everyone you don't want to visit them because their shit smells too in case they use the bathroom? YTA", "Yes I do think YTA. I simply cannot imagine why you think embarrassing your friend over the smell of her pee was acceptable. Light a match, spray some spray, light a candle\u2026 But yes YTA because you chose this instead.", "ESH I think you could have brought it up better, but her reaction was also over the top and super defensive. As a sidenote, you just got me to go get a glass of water so thank you for that.", "Human excrement of any kind can and does smell bad and lingers. YTA because you expect your friend to change their diet to make you comfortable (and let\u2019s be honest you really cannot say with certainty the smell is from soda and not some other medical condition or from a medication - you are being judgemental af). Do you not have bathrooms fans where you live?? Bathrooms where I live have a light that also usually functions as an exhaust fan - when someone take a sh*t they turn on the fan. Get some bathroom spray or a fan and stop being an AH. And apologize.", "ESH cause how you both handled it", "ESH, smelly pee isn\u2019t that big of a deal but you were right to tell her to drink more water", "NTA Kidney stones AGAIN? You think after one of those spiky urethra slicers you\u2019d do anything to stop more", "NTA not even for losing it and being specific. Look too much soda kills people. I had a friend who lost her brother in his 30s and the main cause was he had an addiction to Coca Cola. It's terrible for your kidneys, teeth, and body to use soda as water, and the long-term effects can be very serious. When you're young you think everything is reversible. It really is not! You can't just change your mind one day and undo the damage. A REAL FRIEND TELLS YOU THE TRUTH even if it may end the friendship. Everyone deserves a friend like that. You weren't being harsh. She asked, you didn't offer. You told the truth when she asked, and if the truth is that her pee smells rancid that is the truth.", "NTA.

There *is* a gene some people have that can make people's pee stink if they eat asparagus though. If asparagus is a regular part of her diet, then that's probably the culprit.

Apologize to her and just say you're afraid for her health and sadly the side effect of that is pungent (probably ammonia rich) pee smell.

Our feces and urine actually can tell pretty well if something is very wrong in your bodies. For example i love carbonation in a drink. I have bought the carbonators and i carbonate my own water.
