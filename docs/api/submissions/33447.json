He is very wealthy and dangles trips like this to corral the family together. I did not want to go on this Mexico trip. Instead, I wanted to go on a much less expensive trip just the four of us, at our own expense. But my husband really wanted to do this Mexico trip with his dad, so I relented.\n\nI had one condition: That we have a separate sleeping area from our children. I absolutely hate sleeping in a room together. I never ever do it. I plan entire trips around not having to share a room. It's not just that the kids are loud sleepers and won't stay out of our bed if we're in the same room (which is also true). They're very young, so it's not like we can put them to bed and then leave. Someone will need to be in a dark, silent room with them after night after bedtime, which is 7:30PM.\n\nI very clearly stipulated this condition to my husband and father-in-law. Not only that, I asked my husband more than once to confirm that the accommodations were adequate weeks ago, which he did not do. \n\nThis week, I learned that the four of us had been booked into a single room. I am furious. The general reaction from everyone, including my husband, is that I'm overreacting and it's not a big deal. That I should be grateful for this trip.\n\nI have been giving my husband the silent treatment for 3 days. He admits that he messed up, but thinks I'm being unreasonable. He's not feeling well, so has not tried to fix the situation. That's fallen on me. Folks, I never wanted to go on this trip in the first place. I would have never accepted it had I known the accommodations. I don't need a luxury trip that badly. I would have said \"thank you, but no.\"\n\nFWIW, this incident is on the heels of a nine-day trip my husband recently took. Not a work trip, a trip he took voluntarily chose to go on. I was on solo childcare with two children during that time. To say I feel disrespected and taken advantage of is a vast understatement.\n\nEDIT: To make things clear, my 4-person family (me, husband, two kids) were booked into a single open room. I had requested either a one-bedroom suite (that features a bedroom with a door and small living area) or two side-by-side standard rooms (ideally adjoining).

Did you expect FIL to fund the entire trip AND be the kid's chaperone every night? \n\nDon't get me wrong- if you asked your husband to get clarity on the sleeping arraignments and he did not that is upsetting and wrong. If the FIL promised to accommodate your request and the  reneged and just got one room that is upsetting and wrong. You do not clarify if FIL agreed to this condition. Only that you demanded it. But tbh, in general- your kids your problem. Getting a free vacation is typically not going to check every single box. You are going to have to make some concessions. Heck growing up my family always did one room with 2 queen beds and me (the oldest) sleeping on a cot or chair while my parents and sisters took the beds just to save money. \n\nJudgment is kind of based on the INFO, but in general if it's not your money it's really not your call and if it's your kids that require conditions it's your problem to manage them. If FIL agreed to getting two rooms and babysitting after 7:30 then bought one room I guess N T A. But honestly NAH besides your husband for not doing the leg work he agreed to do.

She wants to spend time with her kids, and since FIL didn't honor her request to book the suite / extra room and her husband didn't follow up, she needs to take matters into her own hands.

It stinks that your husband is whiffing on his responsibility here, but if the choices are \"it's his job and he doesn't do it, or I do it and it gets done\" ... is this really the time to try to prove a point?

She can stay home while her family enjoys their time together without her if she\u2019d like, unless there\u2019s a gun to her head that I\u2019m unaware of. Otherwise she should make the best of it, appreciate the time she will spend with her kids and let go of this grudge she\u2019s holding.", "Sometimes kids don\u2019t survive unfortunately.", "Neither Dad nor a hotel babysitter is going to sit alone in a chair in a dark hotel room for several hours. OP doesn't want to go to bed with the kids at 730pm but she doesn't want another Madeleine McCann. She's trapped.\n\nEveryone here is projecting their good parent/person instincts on to someone who's own wife clearly doesn't trust him.  The question for OP isn't Who's the Asshole but could (not should or would) but *could* she send her \"very young\" children to Mexico for a week over Christmas without her, to be cared for by her husband and father in law.\n\nThat's a yes or no question. If the answer is no, then she either goes with to Mexico and bed at 730pm or she *and the children* stay home.  OP seems conditioned, sadly, to make her needs small, so I think she'll go. The silent treatment is the only tool left in her box to express her feeling unimportant and disrespected.\n\nAnd all it would have taken is for the \"very wealthy\" father in law to have honored her request and booked a suitable room.  I'm sorry, OP.  You are married to Peter Pan.  He will not stand up for you and he will expect you to always make his life comfortable.", "How is this \u201cscorched earth?\u201d\n\nI hate this narrative that the people who do the wildly ridiculously inappropriate thing are assholes, but people who respond in a basic, logical, appropriate way are somehow taking it \u201ctoo far.\u201d\n\nShe communicated a CLEAR condition. It wasn\u2019t met. I think it\u2019s setting a horrible precedent to just go along with it and let him get away with just railroading her. \n\nThey legitimately tried to trap her. Fully believing that if they just fed her bullshit long enough, she\u2019d be in too deep and wouldn\u2019t be able to say no. They knew she\u2019d be pissed, and they did it anyway. You know what that tells me? They don\u2019t care how angry she gets. As long as they can do what they want and she\u2019ll ultimately go along with it. They figure they\u2019ll downplay it to make her feel like her anger isn\u2019t valid and just ride it out until she\u2019s sick of talking about it and just capitulates. Ask him what he thought was going to happen.\n\nAnd this is coming from someone who usually thinks this sub goes way overboard. \n\nWe can validate her feelings all day, but if all she does is get mad, and he doesn\u2019t take her anger seriously, this is going to continue to happen. This will be her marriage. ESPECIALLY if the reason she goes along with it is because she genuinely can\u2019t trust that her husband will be able to make sure the kids are good and have a good time if she\u2019s not there.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the silent treatment is appropriate. It\u2019s not effective and it\u2019s manipulative too.  Just don\u2019t go. You said you wouldn\u2019t if they booked it this way, so don\u2019t. Calm. Firm. Express your disappointment and frank disbelief that he would try to pull something this audacious, but don\u2019t yell or resort to passive aggression. Thanks but no thanks. Absolutely not going. You have fun, and you\u2019re sure as shit not leaving the kids with me while you go on vacation. I didn\u2019t agree to that and you\u2019re not taking this away from them now. Enjoy.\n\nThe way I look at it, that\u2019s the least scorched-earth response. It\u2019s just\u2026 following through. Not her fault he thought she was bluffing. \n\nOtherwise she\u2019s just allowing him to erode her free will and the legitimacy of her word, her voice and her equal power as a partner and in her family structure. And take it from someone who has been there.. if he\u2019s already at a point where he will do something this ludicrously dismissive and presumptive and just assume it will be okay\u2026 this will be her marriage for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhen it comes to \u201cendangering the hostages\u201d\u2026 the metaphor is neat, but ultimately he is their parent. And if you can\u2019t trust your coparent to take your kids, what are you even doing coparenting with them? You\u2019re already just parenting by yourself with a needy adult flitting around making it more difficult.", "It\u2019s \u201cscorched earth\u201d to decide to not attend a vacation where she\u2019ll be miserable????", "If her children are in danger when under their father's care, then the kids shouldn't be going anywhere, especially a foreign country, with such a useless man. What happens to the kids if Mom goes, then get sick or in an accident?", "Maybe OP could still go on the trip, but book her own separate room in the same hotel?\n\nThat way she can tuck her kids in bed and then leave them with hubby for the night while she goes to her room on the other side of the hotel.", "You're ignoring what she just said. Why?", "Except if she is physically present, they will likely bluff to the point she caves first, because she is an adult, and feels responsibility. This whole thing is set up on the predication that she will just end up doing what needs to be done, despite her opinion on the issue.", "Spill the tea!", "This was my thought. OP says they want quality time with the kids but, honestly, they get that anyhow as they seem to be the main parent. After all, hubby was gone for 9 days recently.", "She wants to spend this time with her kids. For some parents life isn't all about getting away from their children and offloading the responsibility for taking care of them on other people. Even though they might be justified in doing so.", "They wouldn't have to turn off the lights in both rooms at 7:30 and the kids wouldn't be tempted to try to crawl into the parents bed. \n\nShe wanted to put the kids down for bed and turn off just their light. \n\nI'm guessing that traveling with a family is stressful enough and she needed that time to herself, awake and relaxing, at the end of the day. The kids need more sleep than she does.", "What do you think parents do at home when their kids are asleep? Do you think they go to bed at 7pm?", "Sometimes the adults don't survive!", "That's a huge and ridiculous leap.", "Madeline McCann came to mind.", "They're not 6 week old kittens are they?", "They are going in a luxury hotel, what can going wrong.", "What you fail to realize, is that when people like OP's husband are suddenly in the position of bearing the 'slight inconvenience' of shitty decisions, like having to face the reality of being the one sitting silently in the dark room, suddenly the obvious solution that was asked for, but not deemed necessary, becomes much more easily achievable! Suddenly, the funds for the two room suite, or adjoining rooms are right there!", "Exactly. \n\nYou are on the money here and yet others are acting like you are advocating for something nuts. \n\n\nThank you for this", "What a thoughtful reply.  Let me expand a little bit.\n\nIf a relationship is based on a conditional acceptance, *I like you as long as . . .,* then a challenge to the status quo is a full frontal assault. From the admittedly incomplete picture we have, OP is \"liked\" as long as she does what her husband wants.  Trip to Mexico, solo trip of 9 days, don't anger father in law.\n\nHer role in the marriage is to make him happy.  Does he feel the same obligation?  Well, she feels furious, disrespected, unsupported, so no, he clearly does not.  What happens if she does not care what he thinks and refuses to go to Mexico?  The balance of power shifts. To *her.*  There's no unringing that bell.  That's what I meant by scorched earth.  \n\nI agree with what you've said.  This is her marriage for the foreseeable future. The husband thinks OP will cave, like always and he can enjoy a beach vacay drinking Coronas with Dad. And, no, she can't trust him to coparent.  His weaponized incompetence will mean she does all the adulting while he takes a cute picture of the kids petting some dolphins.\n\nI", "The rooms don\u2019t need to be side by side. Your husband can put the kids to bed and sleep in that room and you can have the other one.", "This makes no sense.  Get a second room.  For you alone.  Ask the hotel to get it as close as possible.  If it's at least on the same floor, it's not much different than next door.", "No baby-sitter is going to sit in a dark, silent hotel room while children sleep.", "Thanks for your input! It's super irrelevant though and ignores OP's needs. Just like her husband is doing.", "Yes, I have 4 and 7 year olds", "No, someone will need to be in the room because the hotel room the FIL booked is ONE BEDROOM. Like have you seen a hotel room? If the children are sleeping, they can't be alone in the hotel room unless there's a living room or an adjoining room. So someone has to stay there. And because it's one bedroom, it has to be dark and quiet for the children to sleep.\n\nThis... please, think this through. Where are they supposed to go when the children are sleep if it's one bedroom?", "I don\u2019t see how a trip with her kids is a misery. Kids sleep through everything. They can turn on a lamp and the tv and have a quiet night with the kids in the room. And if they have to fight them from getting into their bed they failed to train them not to do it. All I had to do was say no, and mine went back to his bed. Easy. OP is insufferable.", "There are people in the world that are genuinely suffering and OP is mad about sleeping in the same room as her children for a week. \n\nWhether she does or doesn\u2019t have a miserable time with her family on this trip is completely up to her. She can decide to make the best of it or she can decide to sulk and hold a grudge for no good reason. \n\nShe\u2019s an asshole if she decides to stay mad about this and we can agree to disagree on the matter lmao", "As someone who pulled lifeless body of 6 year old from bottom of the pool - i can only speak out of my own experience.", "My thoughts too", "Read my response of pulling lifeless body of 6 year old from the pool.", "Madeleine McCann has entered the chat.", "I was in a luxury hotel once in Japan. The hotel room has a fire escape hidden beside the sofa that goes to a short fenced balcony to the outside. It would have been the end if we never noticed and left the kids to their own devices if you know what I mean. \n\nSo yeah anything can happen. And for the OP to want to be not in the same room in unfamiliar lodging with small children is highly irresponsible. So definitely YTA. And she also sounds entitled.", "But then it's just a game of chicken.  And Player Number One has to be absolutely willing to go through with their threat, without any guarantee of winning. I don't see that happening here.", "She needs to follow through on her boundaries or they will continue to trample them, husband and father both.  This is a mature and appropriate response.  Are they (husband and Dad) going to handle it well?  Probably not, because she likely has not held firm before.  Ask me how I know\u2026.", ">So book the room anyway for yourself, and make it clear that husband is on \u201cdark room babysitting\u201d duties every single night of the holiday.\n\nThis is the way.", "You are a genius. I love this plan.", "If awards were still a thing I would give this comment one.", "The other option is NO ONE GOES. \n\nThey were clear about what they needed to attend, it hasn't been provided. No one goes. FIL chose to throw his money away on a room they couldn't use.\n\nIf they said this doesn't work for us, then it doesn't work. Nothing has changed just because it's almost time to go on the trip.", "I wouldn't try number 2 - it just guarantees a simmering level or resentment and conflict throughout the vacation and no one will have a good time. Also, it sets the precedent that she is willing to bend on her boundaries.", "Wondering that too. Can\u2019t you just call to upgrade to a suite or to what you specifically want?", "Why should she do something that will make her less happy?", "I bet you're offered free dessert sometimes and you turn it down. \n\nThere are people in the world who can't afford dessert. Especially the delicious, free, fluffy piece of chocolate cake, you said no to. \n\nWhy did you say no?\n\nBecause it wouldn't be good for you. Because you didn't want it. Because you didn't like it. Because not having it made you feel better than having it.\n\nOther people only have plain food, if they're that lucky, and you turned down the amazing little luxury called dessert. \n\nThat's ok. And it's ok if she turns down this luxury, even if you wish you could have it. Someone wants the cake you said no to. It's still ok you said no to it.", "You clearly missed the party where the OP wanted to plan a family trip herself.", "Well now we've finally found her!", "If she's not there to catch the pieces, those present are not likely to make them fall. Suddenly, a suite will be reasonable. I mean, if dad is literally stupid enough to be utterly unfit to parent, then this vacation is the least of OP's problems.", "THIS!  \n\nThis is what I was thinking.  At first, I thought they were already there and then I re-read it.  Yes, plenty of time to call the bluff.  You made clear the expectation, they AGREED.  Don't get mad. \"Mmmm, that's too bad.  Maybe next time!\"", "Yeah, I didn't put that as an option because then OP will be  forcing another adult to not go. OP can make choices for herself, and possibly by extension the kids, but not for the husband. He has to make that choice and he has already chosen his path by \"agreeing\" to terms he never followed.", "Oh the simmering has already started, let's be honest. If they go on this vacation or not, the resentment is already there. This is a clusterfuck of a situation, led by FIL and followed with obedience by husband. OP is in a no win, as she doesn't want to lose out on time with her kids and knows that husband has his head stuck right up FIL's behind.\n\nOption 2 is just the best of all crap options, from my POV.", "This shouldn\u2019t make her less happy, is my point. She was offered a generous gift and is acting like it\u2019s the end of the world. \n\nEven if she rather not go on the trip, she needs to stop sulking and get on board. Or she can stay home alone while her family makes memories without her. Totally up to her, but holding a grudge over this is obnoxious.", "Adults do things to make us unhappy every damn day. It\u2019s life. A free trip shouldn\u2019t make her less happy.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a fair comparison, firstly. Plus I turn down free dessert because I have a gluten allergy, but I\u2019m still always incredibly grateful to the person offering. I sure as hell wouldnt throw a fit if they put the dessert on my plate anyways, I simply wouldn\u2019t eat it. \n\nBut this also wasn\u2019t just a dessert, it was an all expenses paid vacation with her family. She can say no if she wants, but she\u2019s definitely not gonna deprive her a family of a good time and think she\u2019s not an asshole for it. I hope OP gets to stay home alone the way she clearly wants to. \n\nIdk man, some people (me) dream of being treated that way and this woman doesn\u2019t even slightly appreciate what she has.", "so let her.", "As in, she has to not be in that hotel, so that dad has to face the problems, not push them onto her. That is a big win, it sounds like.", "Right.  I get it.  You think she's wiling to risk her little ones?  Or her marriage? Do you see her back on the boards chiming in that she's going to show her entitled husband and in-laws what's what? That they can't do her dirty like that?", "She might be a habitual people pleaser, conditioned by her parents to do so, and to seek out exactly the wrong kind of partner. Not one who is intentionally terrible, but one who does not easily look outside his own bubble with empathy. She's clueing in though, she can see the issue with the holiday, and is not pleased. Do you really think the kids would be at risk? That she is the one and only guarantor of their safety? Or that the apparently utterly useless husband would divorce if he was made to be a parent for a few days? This is the perfect, low risk opportunity to illuminate to her hubs and inlaws, and most importantly, herself, that yes indeed, she will no longer be done dirty like that."]}
