He is very wealthy and dangles trips like this to corral the family together. I did not want to go on this Mexico trip. Instead, I wanted to go on a much less expensive trip just the four of us, at our own expense. But my husband really wanted to do this Mexico trip with his dad, so I relented.\n\nI had one condition: That we have a separate sleeping area from our children. I absolutely hate sleeping in a room together. I never ever do it. I plan entire trips around not having to share a room. It's not just that the kids are loud sleepers and won't stay out of our bed if we're in the same room (which is also true). They're very young, so it's not like we can put them to bed and then leave. Someone will need to be in a dark, silent room with them after night after bedtime, which is 7:30PM.\n\nI very clearly stipulated this condition to my husband and father-in-law. Not only that, I asked my husband more than once to confirm that the accommodations were adequate weeks ago, which he did not do. \n\nThis week, I learned that the four of us had been booked into a single room. I am furious. The general reaction from everyone, including my husband, is that I'm overreacting and it's not a big deal. That I should be grateful for this trip.\n\nI have been giving my husband the silent treatment for 3 days. He admits that he messed up, but thinks I'm being unreasonable. He's not feeling well, so has not tried to fix the situation. That's fallen on me. Folks, I never wanted to go on this trip in the first place. I would have never accepted it had I known the accommodations. I don't need a luxury trip that badly. I would have said \"thank you, but no.\"\n\nFWIW, this incident is on the heels of a nine-day trip my husband recently took. Not a work trip, a trip he took voluntarily chose to go on. I was on solo childcare with two children during that time. To say I feel disrespected and taken advantage of is a vast understatement.\n\nEDIT: To make things clear, my 4-person family (me, husband, two kids) were booked into a single open room. I had requested either a one-bedroom suite (that features a bedroom with a door and small living area) or two side-by-side standard rooms (ideally adjoining).

Did you expect FIL to fund the entire trip AND be the kid's chaperone every night? \n\nDon't get me wrong- if you asked your husband to get clarity on the sleeping arraignments and he did not that is upsetting and wrong. If the FIL promised to accommodate your request and the  reneged and just got one room that is upsetting and wrong. You do not clarify if FIL agreed to this condition. Only that you demanded it. But tbh, in general- your kids your problem. Getting a free vacation is typically not going to check every single box. You are going to have to make some concessions. Heck growing up my family always did one room with 2 queen beds and me (the oldest) sleeping on a cot or chair while my parents and sisters took the beds just to save money. \n\nJudgment is kind of based on the INFO, but in general if it's not your money it's really not your call and if it's your kids that require conditions it's your problem to manage them. If FIL agreed to getting two rooms and babysitting after 7:30 then bought one room I guess N T A. But honestly NAH besides your husband for not doing the leg work he agreed to do. You're getting a free trip, FIL is not obligated to spend more to fulfill your demands, and is not obligated to be a babysitter just because you want a separate room.", "Am I the only one saying YTA majorly?
