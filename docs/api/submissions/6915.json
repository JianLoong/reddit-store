My half siblings love him and call him dad. A year after they got married he wanted to adopt all three of us, I said no, but they kept going. Only I was spoken to before the adoption could happen and I told the judge I didn't want to be adopted. So he said he would approve my half siblings adoption but not mine. They decided not to go ahead with it and try again. They did not actually get before a judge when they tried again two years later because they saw what I had said before and decided to deny the request.\n\nAdoption was shelved because they couldn't get anywhere. I still don't want him to be my dad legally. He's not who I call dad, I don't love him, and I don't want to do it for any legal stuff either.\n\nMy half siblings are being adopted again and after some delays, my mom and stepdad wanted me to change my last name so we could all have the same family name. I told them I didn't want to change my name. So they delayed the adoption date twice and tried to convince me. The new date is in a few months and they are going in on the topic. My stepdad told me I rejected him as a legal dad, I could at least take his name. I told him I want my dad's name, not his. My mom then added pressure saying how much it would mean to them. How he has been a good dad to us when we didn't have ours. How I should want the same name as her also, since we've had different names since she remarried. I told her she should love me enough not to push it and she should love dad enough to not want his only kid to have his name replaced by some other man. She told me that I was being insensitive. My stepdad was all kinds of pissed that I would bring up dad that way and he's bitter that I don't want to have his name, or to be his son.\n\nThings are so fucking tense now.

Whatever happens, good luck and best wishes OP", "NTA. You're 16. If your stepdad really loved you, he wouldn't assign levels of love to being adopted and/or taking his name. He's acting like the insecure teenager and you're acting like the adult here.", "NTA\n\nWow. They are being really inconsiderate and it\u2019s not fair to you. You\u2019re old enough to make the decision, it shouldn\u2019t be forced on you. It\u2019s just a name. You want to keep your legal birth name, and that is okay. I\u2019m sure it may make you feel closer to your dad, as well. That\u2019s something that they should understand and feel compassion for. \n\nI think that they are being selfish and only thinking of themselves and not you. You matter. Your feelings matter. If he really cared about you he would understand why you don\u2019t want to take his last name. It\u2019s nothing against him. He needs to stop taking it personal and view it from your perspective.", "NTA. It\u2019s your choice and I\u2019m sorry they\u2019re not respecting it.", "NTA.\nYou are 16? What is their weird obsession about it. That\u2019s just odd.", "NTA - Usually therapists tell parents that if the kids don't want to take a step-parents name or be adopted by step parent to let the children choose.  It should be the children's choice.   They even say that with kids under 10, so at 16 they should take your feelings seriously.", "NTA\n\nA name is the most personal thing to a person. They\u2019re not asking you to take his name, they\u2019re asking you to give up yours, and by extension any representative connection you have to your father. You don\u2019t say how old you are, but clearly you have a strong opinion and it should be respected. That they can\u2019t put aside their own feelings and emotions and put themselves in your shoes is the real problem.", "NTA. I find it creepy as hell that your stepdad wants you to have the same last name. He doesn\u2019t respect the memory of your father at all. He is an AH. And your mother is one for allowing him to show that type of disrespect.", "Why in the world would she want you to change your last name. At your age and disrespectful because you\u2019re of your fathers name and to erase that is selfish of her.", "Nope NTA. Period...tell mom to read this post and say to her, \"Stop gaslighting your child into making a decision that only benefits you.\"", "NTA. That\u2019s why they ask you. At 16 here in Aus you\u2019re old enough to leave school and get a full time job so you\u2019re well and truly old enough to know your own mind according to a judge. \n\nYour mother and step father are assholes for denying your half siblings their adoptions because you don\u2019t want one though", "NTA, even if your stepdad was your favorite person that ever lived your feelings about preserving your dad\u2019s last name would still be 100% valid. You\u2019re under no obligation to change your name, accept adoption, or anything else of the sort and if they respected you enough they\u2019d agree too.", "The adults are manipulating /guilt tripping A H\u2019s.

Your mother is being incredibly disrespectful of you as a person. It's *your* name, you're the one who has the final say in what it is.

It\u2019s so fkn cruel and rude they are trying to completely erase him from your life.", "NTA and your mom is super messed up for pressuring you. Your stepdad too but your mom has more obligation to you than he does. It is your life, your name, your choice. Would it do any good to have a heart to heart with your mom just the 2 of you?", "NTA.  Having the same surname is not what makes a family a family.", "NTA \n\nYour mom and stepdad are the assholes. They need to respect your wishes and move on.

When they get you back in front of a judge again, be very nice and polite to the judge.  Tell them no you don't want this and give the them your reasoning. They will back you like the last one did. \n\nIf this next hearing is just for you, I would probably go as far as to also apologize to the judge and tell them you are sorry for wasting their time because you've already told your mom and step dad no on this (for awhile now) but they keep harassing you about it and bringing you back in front of a judge anyway. Tell them your answer will not change.  Maybe that will open the door for them to step in and keep your mom and step dad from trying it again after that. \n\nGood luck.", "Do you have any other family? Your grandparents?

NTA no one has a right to demand you change your name for them, and you are allowed to maintain a connection with your deceased father by keeping him as your only legal dad if you want.\nIf you need more affirmation just search \u201cadopted, name, stepdad/stepmom\u201d on this subreddit and see how many stories pop up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have already done part of this, but please try again.  In a non-confrontational way, sit down with your mom and her husband and explain to them that you are thankful for the role the husband is playing in your life and all he has done and is doing for you, your mom and your sisters.  Then explain to them again that it's  important to you to remain your dad's son and not be adopted.  Whatever they say to you, please try not to get angry.  Just let it roll off.  Give them all the time they need to explain why this is so important to them and how they and you will benefit.
