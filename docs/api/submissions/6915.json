I told her she should love me enough not to push it and she should love dad enough to not want his only kid to have his name replaced by some other man. She told me that I was being insensitive. My stepdad was all kinds of pissed that I would bring up dad that way and he's bitter that I don't want to have his name, or to be his son.\n\nThings are so fucking tense now.

You\u2019re old enough to make the decision, it shouldn\u2019t be forced on you. It\u2019s just a name. You want to keep your legal birth name, and that is okay.

It should be the children's choice.   They even say that with kids under 10, so at 16 they should take your feelings seriously.", "NTA\n\nA name is the most personal thing to a person. They\u2019re not asking you to take his name, they\u2019re asking you to give up yours, and by extension any representative connection you have to your father. You don\u2019t say how old you are, but clearly you have a strong opinion and it should be respected. That they can\u2019t put aside their own feelings and emotions and put themselves in your shoes is the real problem.", "NTA.

Period...tell mom to read this post and say to her, \"Stop gaslighting your child into making a decision that only benefits you.\"", "NTA. That\u2019s why they ask you. At 16 here in Aus you\u2019re old enough to leave school and get a full time job so you\u2019re well and truly old enough to know your own mind according to a judge. \n\nYour mother and step father are assholes for denying your half siblings their adoptions because you don\u2019t want one though", "NTA, even if your stepdad was your favorite person that ever lived your feelings about preserving your dad\u2019s last name would still be 100% valid.

When they get you back in front of a judge again, be very nice and polite to the judge.  Tell them no you don't want this and give the them your reasoning. They will back you like the last one did. \n\nIf this next hearing is just for you, I would probably go as far as to also apologize to the judge and tell them you are sorry for wasting their time because you've already told your mom and step dad no on this (for awhile now) but they keep harassing you about it and bringing you back in front of a judge anyway. Tell them your answer will not change.  Maybe that will open the door for them to step in and keep your mom and step dad from trying it again after that. \n\nGood luck.", "Do you have any other family? Your grandparents?
