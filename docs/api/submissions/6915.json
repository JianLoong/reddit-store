I think you're old enough to decide if you'd like a name change. I also think it's honorable to want to keep your last name almost in memory of your late dad. I notice though it seems like you and stepdad don't have much of a relationship. Is there a reason you're against having him as a father figure? Perhaps if he's a decent enough stepdad and you explain that you do appreciate him for what he's done as a part of the family, for being there for you guys, etc, maybe it'll ease your parentals' mind enough to understand where you're really coming from. I totally understand you want to keep your dad's memory alive by keeping your name which is totally reasonable, I just don't understand the full rejection of your mom's husband in your life. He shouldn't replace your dad, but he can be a positive person in your life. Maybe trying to communicate a bit differently can help them remove their own agenda and actually hear and try to understand where you're coming from.

Your dad passed away when you were 6 years old. That is 6 years of relationship you had with your father. Your half siblings father left them. You were 6 when your mother met half siblings father and 9 when your mother met stepdad so that means your half siblings were babies/toddlers when their dad left. Not only that but she made it like your dad alive and wanted nothing to do with you. \n\nI understand the half siblings getting adopted and changing their last name because of their ages, the stepdad is the only dad they knew and you knew your dad because you were old enough to have memories of him.

Unfortunately, he wasn't on the same page and tried to push me into calling him dad.  Thankfully, my mom realized that she had three kids and didn't want a fourth, so she divorced him.  Your half siblings were young enough that they didn't have memories of their father, so it was easier to accept someone new.
