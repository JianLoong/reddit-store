It was a very hard decision and long journey for me, but I've worked through some of the fear and guilt that was keeping me there.\n\nWhile I was attending church, I was a very integral part of the service. I was the only person in the church who could play music and sing. Every week I would work with the pastor to pick worship music based on his sermon that week, and then on Saturday I would essentially run a one man worship concert. I did this for about six years, since I was fifteen.\n\nAnother important thing to mention is that I'm gay. I've known since high school, and so have my parents. They're surprisingly supportive, considering the conservative church we have been attending for as long as I can remember. I've never been in the closet, but I've also never publicly come out on social media or anything. The one time I brought my girlfriend to church everyone thought she was just a friend I was trying to convert.\n\nTwo weeks ago was my breaking point. Our pastor's sermon was about how the world is becoming more inclusive. It was a long (and frankly awful) sermon, but the part that finally got me to leave was when he mentioned how \"all the kids are gay now\" and how our whole generation needed to \"either repent or burn in hell eternally\". Before this happened I knew that our denomination wasn't exactly welcoming of the LGBTQ+ community, but to hear it so bluntly stated in front of everyone was something else and I couldn't keep living in blissful ignorance. I decided that after the service I would no longer take part in a church who didn't like people like me.\n\nThe next week when he called me to arrange to meet about the church service for that week, I politely explained that I would no longer be taking part or attending his church anymore. I tried to keep it civil, just telling him that our views and theologies didn't align anymore and for both of our sake I was leaving. He freaked out, telling me it wasn't fair to him or the rest of the congregation that I would leave so abruptly without making alternate arrangements to replace music. He tried to demand I come back until he could find someone else, but I declined and then hung up the phone.\n\nSince then I have had countless church members telling me how disappointed they are that church has been canceled and how I should make things right with God and come back to the church. I have also had the pastor reach back out asking if I would teach guitar to his son if I was really going to leave forever. I have declined. My parents have mentioned that it was rude to leave as abruptly as I did without giving anyone a chance to try and find a replacement.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for leaving the church with nobody to replace me, essentially making it so that church is cancelled until they find a replacement?", "created_utc": 1700989446, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1846pq5/aita_for_leaving_the_church_even_though_they_cant/", "score": 358, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then again, the OT tells Christians what to do when a man lies with a man and doesn't mention lesbians, so maybe you're right - if we squint hard enough at the words in the book we can make all the objectively bad stuff disappear", "Justified assholes are NTA just so you know!", "How were they the asshole for basically going (close to) no contact with an organisation that acts hatefully towards them?\n\nIf someone tells you that you're sinful, disgusting, going to hell, anything like that, for doing nothing wrong, abandon them. That is not being an asshole.", "Fuck that. She doesn't owe people that hate her existence one second of her time no matter what was promised.", "It doesn\u2019t. For where two or three are gathered  in my name, I am there among them.\u201d Matthew 18:20.  They\u2019re trying to guilt trip OP into living a lie, a lie any God would see right through.  OP is NTA.", "I\u2019m Catholic and we don\u2019t have singers, the priest starts the song and everyone sings along. We have a pipe organ but when the musician is sick, we do without.\n\nA singer / choir and guitarist is only on special occasions like weddings or Christmas", "Or just play recorded music. \n\nWhat happened when OP was sick or went out of town? Did they just assume she was going to stick around forever?\n\nI'm surprised the pastor wants OP to teach his son guitar. He might catch the gay.", "I can't believe this is real, they can do it without music or put YouTube or something with the music they hear. That's ridiculous", "When I was a kid, I used to go to a church that didn't had singers. They just put recorded instrumental music. I liked that church because the mass was short (30 minutes) since the pastor made a short sermon and they didn't waste time with the songs.", "Tape recorders are a thing. Karaoke is a thing. Spotify and Youtube exist. Somebody just needs to put in some effort to download and/or buy the music they need. \nThis isn't about OP's unique \"talent\". This is about them being stingy and lazy to manipulate OP.", "Or a Bluetooth speaker", "I\u2019m sure OP is a talented musician, but she can\u2019t be the only one. There must be someone else in the congregation who can carry a tune. Basic musical ability is hardly rare, and would do in a pinch. No reason to cancel service.\n\nOr the church should do what a lot of churches do: pay someone to play the organ or lead the musical portion of the service. \n\nOP, you are NTA. You get to decide where and when to use your talent. Not the pastor, not the congregation, not anyone else. Just you.", "It largely sounds like, since they're very conservative and OP has been \"good\", they are very blind to OP being gay. Hence bringing a GF and everyone just thinking it was a friend.", "Exactly this. What happens if OP gets sick or has alternative plans? Church is cancelled until OP feels better?", "Ooh, that would be great to be the fly! Maybe they'll do it and record it so we can be?", "For real! I am amazed at the number of people who have not read the book they claim is saving their soul.\n\nSeriously.  Ask any Christian how many times they have read the Bible cover to cover.  About 5% will have read it multiple times, the other 95% *have never read the book they have based their whole spiritual identity and life on!*\n\nI really do believe that Christians would be much better people if they actually read the Bible.  Jesus was alright but so many people don\u2019t even bother to read his story yet claim him as a spiritual leader.  So bonkers!", "How is declining to participate in organizing something that was 1. unpaid labor for OP and 2. used to denigrate her and people like her in a way that has proven to be damaging rude?\n\nMusic isn't a requirement to have a church gathering.  There are lots of churches of  all types of denominations that hold services without music.  Just like it's not rude to ghost an abusive significant other, it isn't rude to ghost an abusive church, but she didn't ghost them, she let them know before the next service that she would not be participating.", "She didn\u2019t say, but if there was a contract and she was breaking some terms I thought she would mention. Sounds like a small church, probably don\u2019t have big budgets for music (or they might not have a teenager as their only music performer, as she started at age 15)", "Yes of course. You don't need music for a service. At our church (Anglican/Episcopal/Church of England) we have an 8:00 am said service. No music at all. The choral service is later.", "Every Catholic church I've been to has a choir at weekly mass.  I grew up Catholic and my parents are still practicing.  The bishop/priest may prefer just an organist.", "> He might catch the gay.\n\nI don't think they know OP is gay.", "Bet they see YT as sin.", "I think it can be a pentecostal church or something similar. Music was a big deal in the pentecostal church I grew up in. (But they would just sing without musical instruments)", ">Hence bringing a GF and everyone just thinking it was a friend.\n\nSmall communities like churches can have some truly fascinating blind spots at times. \n\nMy sister actually had the opposite experience - she joined a local church choir while she was at university and so did a girl from the same student halls. They got on fine but weren't close friends. But apparently at some point the rest of the choir/congregation made some interesting assumptions about them, because when she graduated, someone came up to her to say that she'd be very much missed...and that she and her girlfriend had done the church a world of good by being there and reminding everyone that LGBT people were just like everyone else. \n\n(She uh... wasn't quite sure what to say to that, other than thanking them for the sentiment!)", "Agree completely and I find that so hypocritical! I also think the pastor is very aware that OP is gay!", "They're just spineless centrists who think victims are somehow obligated to never inconvenience those who harm them. They're as bad as the bigots if you ask me.", "I agree. It would have been rude if she had gotten up before the entire congregation and announced she was leaving and why. \n\nSometimes a clean break is exactly what you need when ending a relationship. I can imagine all the pressure they would have put on OP if she had given a 2 week notice.", "Yeah that\u2019s the only way even the slightest amount of blame could go on her and even then, fuck it, don\u2019t pay her anymore she has every right to walk away. I pretty much guarantee she wasn\u2019t being paid though. No one exploits volunteers like small churches", "I suppose that's an American thing, then. In Europe, it's not. We don't want to actively integrate everyone :D", "I don't think so. If my own experience in a similar situation at the church tells me anything, it's that the last place the pastor would want OP is around their kid if they knew OP was gay."]}
