My dog isn\u2019t allowed to interact with stranger\u2019s children either, and I was cautious when introducing him to children I know. Both kids and dogs can be unpredictable and it only takes a split second for something to go wrong, especially with children who aren\u2019t use to dogs and you have no way of knowing how much experience a stranger\u2019s child has with a dog.", "What a strange sense of entitlement anyone thinks their kids should be able to play with a random stranger's dog.", "This is something that really frustrates me. I feel some people wouldn't call the SPCA if their own dog bit their child but would be willing to do that if my dog bit their child.", "Sorry, I tried to keep things brief for readability and word count.\n\nAs I was trying to leave, the kids started to interact with the dog without my permission or even talking to me. That's why I picked him up; I couldn't get him to walk away.", "Omg this is the new name for my JRT. This made me lol", "When I was researching dogs for adoption, I did read that children are very often responsible for serious injuries in dogs that weigh less than 20 lbs, especially broken legs.", "I live in the PNW. Either beaches are dog friendly, or they are banned. The places I visit don't really count as beaches, because they're so small and behind my apartment complex", "I'm only talking about averages. I grew up with a JRT/Beagle split. Was my best friend in the whole world, would absolutely bite another child.", " Everything else is irrelevant & nobody gets to determin whether your reason for reason was acceptable or not", "\ud83d\udcaf  NTA op", "As a fellow dog owner, thank you so much!\n\nOur culture wants to classify dogs as either angels or demons with no in between, so everyone wants to think their dog never ever could bite a human because having any doubt about that seems to be the same as considering your dog to be evil.\n\nI don't let my pitbull interact with children because the best I can say is that he never actually has bitten a human, and that it doesn't seem to be his first response, and he *probably* wouldn't. And probably isn't good enough.", " I'm trying to move my increasingly hysterical on-lead dog away from theirs.", "Completely agree. \n\nI would rather have a living dog than let strangers play with him.", "I see you've met my Yorkie lol\n\nShe's a butthead but she is cute and loving. Just a stubborn little *butthead.*\n\nMy last three dogs have been Yorkies and I've been *given* each and every one of them either because someone passed and the family couldn't make it mind or because they couldn't train it."]}
