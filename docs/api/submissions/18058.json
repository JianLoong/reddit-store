You never know what little kids that age might do to a dog.", "NTA - that dad is incredibly irresponsible and entitled.", "Why are you letting some obnoxious asshole make you feel bad for keeping yourself and your animal safe? NTA", "NTA I would\u2019ve picked my dog up too. Why TF does he feel entitled to YOUR dog????", "NTA\n\nThat dad wanted free entertainment for his kids.", "NTA. You're being a responsible dog owner. I work in insurance claims and we have seen so many claims like yours where some innocent playing suddenly turns into a few nasty scars and the dog owner gets sued. Because just like you said, you never do know what could happen. Plus that dad sounds totally like the kind of person who would sue with the \"let my kids play with your dog at their own peril! I know your dog better than you!\" attitude.", "NTA. That entitled AH's kids are not entitled to someone else's dog.", "NTA - you're being responsible and it's great that you're aware of your dog's breed tendencies and have worked to prevent issues! If the Dad wanted a dog to play with his kids he can get his own dog. Legally, your dog is your property and you're not obligated to other people playing with your pet.\n\nI have a dog and I am careful to leash my dog around small kids. He's a labrador and that breed is great with kids, but children aren't predictable and he doesn't live with any at the moment. Better safe than sorry, especially with small children I don't know.", "NTA. that man was unhinged. what a crazy way to try to say his kids wanted to play with your dog. tbh i wouldn't trust stranger children around my dog either, and probably vice versa. kids are so unpredictable, and some dogs are really unsettled by it.", "NTA what the heck. How can he expect anything from you and your dog. That guy was a weirdo.  You did the right thing.", "NTA.\n\nYour dog is your responsibity. It's great you're protecting him. The dad thinks of the dog just as toy for his kids. I can't believe he had the audacity to demand for you to stay there just because his kids are playing with your dog. You didn't make any issue, you just left the area. He has no right to confront you about it.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not the dads business why you\u2019re taking your dog away.\n\nNot every pet owner wants their pet playing with kids. That\u2019s your right.", "NTA. You are a responsible dog owner and looking out for your pup. \n\nIf anything had gone wrong I\u2019m sure dad wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to sue/push to get your dog taken by animal control and euthanized.", "NTA. It's super weird to ask a stranger why they're leaving no matter what the circumstances. Also, sounds like you raised your dog better than he raised his kids - they think it's ok to start playing with a dog without asking the owner first?", "NTA - You have a responsibility to keep your dog safe and to keep others safe from your dog. You didn't expect them to leave the beach, which is very considerate.  You simply moved.  The dad was 100% in the wrong here.  More dog owners should be like you.", "Obviously NTA. It\u2019s your dog. Not the dad\u2019s.", "Of course, you're NTA for being a responsible dog owner, kudos to you. That man should take your example and start being a responsible parent.", "Is this real? HOW are people so dense. Obviously NTA.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t your responsibility to explain to a stranger why you\u2019re choosing to leave a public space, and it certainly isn\u2019t your responsibility to entertain that stranger\u2019s children.", "Absolutely positively NTA. You\u2019re being a responsible pet parent!it\u2019s if little dogs lien yours tend to be earth and even afraid of kids. If something were to happen, it would if somehow been the yours/dog\u2019s fault", "NTA. Is the father insane?! He is up for allowing your dog to play with his children, even though you told him the dog might be dangerous? Why?\n\nSome people should not have children.", "Obvious NTA. Doesn't matter why; Your dog, you chose to leave. Everything else is irrelevant & nobody gets to determin whether your reason for reason was acceptable or not", "NTA\n\nIt's your dog, your responsible for him and if you wanna go your allowed to go.\n\nI feel like if something happened to his children around your dog, the father would be the first one pointing at the dog asking it to be destroyed.\n\nIf he wants a dog he can get his own!

She does great with 90% of the dogs she meets but I know from her body language when it\u2019s not a good combo so we walk away when she starts to act like she does when she sees Diego. I honestly think he was mad because you took away his kids entertainment and doesn\u2019t actually care about the well being of your dog."]}
