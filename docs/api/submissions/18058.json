Not your families \u201c pet\u201d for the hour.", "NTA. If the situation was reversed no one would be asking why you took your kids away from the dog.", "Nta- you are a good responsible dog owner.", "Nta..\nBut...\nEvery dog can be aggressive with kids... your statements tarnishing all JRTs are not true at all.\nI have one.. he's 13... my kiddo is 9..\nThey are best friends..  he loves kids and other dogs and have never ever been aggressive with anyone...\nI know many jacks.... none are what you say they \"are\"..", "NTA So many people know their dog won\u2019t do well with children/dogs etc and don\u2019t care. You did the right thing and removed yours because you knew of the possibly dangers. This makes you better than most dog owners. Also fuck that guy for thinking your dog is their toy to play with as they see fit. And I bet he would\u2019ve been real pissed if your dog bit his kid.", "Nope not at all", "NTA, AT ALL. As a dog owner, it always infuriates me when people expect me to let my dogs play with their kids. Neither of my dogs are aggressive, but if a kid yanks their tail or hurts them, I would not put it past them to react to it (rightfully so), and I have to trust that your kid won't hurt my dog? I had a golden as a child who was the sweetest things. I only ever heard him snarl once, after the kid I was babysitting kicked him in his privates and tumor (tumor was immediately behind it). I had told him to be careful, as he was playing and was getting a bit much, but he thought he was being funny. Dog did not bite, but the kid went right to mom who wanted him euthanized, I don't let kids play with my dogs anymore.", "I used to own a dog walking company and have literal decades of experience with dogs. I was walking a very sweet Doberman mix who had literally been a street dog in Honduras before her mom took her home. Loved kids but was 50/50 with other dogs. \n\nHer body language was *exactly* the same with the dogs she liked and the dogs she didn\u2019t until it wasn\u2019t. So I just didn\u2019t let her greet dogs. This guy with a little white fluffy dog stopped to talk to me and kept insisting that their body language was fine and it was my anxiety that was causing the problem. Meanwhile his dog was staring my girl down and practically daring her to snap. Dude asked me if I had any experience with dogs. I replied with, \u201cyes, decades and I do assessments on dogs who are in the court system for aggression\u201d. He then replied with, \u201cwell if you have to tell me it\u2019s probably not real credentials\u201d. He ASKED. \n\nAnyway that whole story to say some people suck and there\u2019s no fixing it. OP you kept your dog and those kids safe. Well done. NTA", "I moved in next to a crazy couple, and the woman didn't have custody of her kids. She came over to tell me to have my dog outside in Saturday morning because she got her kids for a visit, and they should play with the dog. I made very sure not to go outside in Saturday morning. (She was also pregnant and gave me a list of things I could buy for her impending baby...)"]}
