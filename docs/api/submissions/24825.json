That is not ok in anyway op! \ud83e\udd2c", "NTA. I believe under common law, a school nurse can\u2019t do that without express permission or in an emergent situation, which does not seem to apply here at all. Hope she learns from this, but sorry your son had to be the example that will teach her.", "I'm gonna go with NTA. I'm a dentist and I wouldn't pull out a kids' tooth in my office without getting explicit consent from the parent first. Having said that, it is a baby tooth that by all accounts was well on its way out anyway. I cannot tell you how many times a parent or child has come in concerned because \"this tooth isn't even loose yet\" when it is, in fact, quite loose. Point being that it may have been more far gone than you or your son realized. I don't want to minimize any trauma this causes you or your son, but it is unlikely that he suffered severe pain in the pulling, and rest assured he will be ok. Could you have toned down your response a notch? Yes. Was it appropriate to bring this up with the school admin and escalate? Also yes.", "What? Every parent in this world helps their kid lose their baby teeth, not many of them are dentists. Even if the nurse should have contacted you before, it's not that bad that he got it out, you would have pulled it out anyway at home.", "NTA.\n\nShe did something she was NOT cleared to do. Which I'm pretty sure is illegal. What if the tooth wasn't fully ready to come out and something had gone wrong. Your son told you he felt pain  + he was scared. He's likely to never want to go to her again. \n\nSo don't take it down, report her.", "YTA. She was literally trying to help him. It was a distraction in class.", "NTA i mean forgetting all the legal stuff\u2026 thats just weird man. I dont blame you", "YTA If you are getting so distraught over petty crap, how are you going to handle real issues? All kids lose their baby teeth. Get a grip.", "It's just fucking baby teeth, chill out. \n\nI even doubt it caused him pain. Kids can be liars and assholes. My nephew had a super loose tooth and my Sister was like, \"well if it hurts ill give you five bucks,\" came out in less then a second and then he said it \"hurt\" and then skipped off with his five bucks.\n\nYTA", "Is this his first baby tooth that has ever fallen out? Your reaction seems a bit extreme. After so many fall out, you get kinda numb to it and are actually grateful when they come out fast. My daughter had one that was loose but just would not come out, the adult tooth started growing in behind it making it worse. Eventually we had to go to the dentist to get it pulled because it was messing up the alignment of the new tooth and causing problems. I'd say the nurse did a good thing getting it out, and your son could have been happy looking forward to a visit from the tooth fairy. Instead, your reaction might have scared him about future loose teeth and given him anxiety over something that's completely normal.", "I think pediatric nurses are fairly capable in this regard. Lost teeth always hurt a little and are uncomfortable, but the dude's not traumatized by it. If anything he's likely more traumatized by your overreaction to this. YTA", "YTA. You don't need to be a dentist to help a kid with a loose baby tooth. She's the school nurse. Have some respect. If a dentist was needed, she would have called one. If a janitor had done it, I might have been a bit miffed but to yell at a school nurse like that makes you TA. \n\nThis is not a major medical procedure, you should have thanked the nurse for helping him out and making sure he got the tooth. Otherwise he might have eaten it with his lunch, or accidentally swallowed it and that can actually cause harm. \"She caused him pain\" - we've all survived the trauma of loosing our baby teeth - few of us had a nurse around when it happened, calm down.", "That would be considered physical assault on a minor.\n\n\nAs a medical professional you are not allowed to remove clothing/ glasses/ dentures, hell, you can't even cut someone's hair/beard without express permission.\n\n\nThe ONLY exception is, if the removal is needed for the patients immediate safety. Like performing cpr on someone. Or someone choking, and you remove tight clothing. \n\n\nA patient could potentially sue over a shaved off beard, if they didn't state that they were okay with it (outside of medical emergencies).", "NTA. People need to be called out for egregious behavior like this. The tooth might not have been ready to come out and she needlessly caused him pain and trauma.", "YTA.", "NTA and should be reported higher. I\u2019m not trying to sound petty but I\u2019m wondering if this borders on assault as she caused him harm.", "NTA.  Lawsuit. Lawsuit. Lawsuit.  This will be the last year that lady's a school nurse.", "You should get the nurse publicly executed. Would only be right/s", "I'd personally report her to the BON.
