So though you are correct that she had no training and authority. Nobody that pulls a tooth does. When it comes to permission, implied consent is a thing. If a kid comes in the nurse's office with their trousers rolled up, displaying a scraped knee. That is implied consent to clean the wound and stick a plaster on top. Same with a wobbly tooth. The nurse did screw up by not recording this properly. She may have known she isn't supposed to touch it and kept it off the record so she could help. If I was the kid or the parent I would be perfectly happy with her help. I probably wouldn't even bother contacting the school about not seeking my permission since it is such a non event. If literally every kid through human history has managed to deal with removing 20 baby teeth by themselves then I'm sure an experienced nurse could manage.

If he had swallowed the tooth after the nurse refused to touch it I bet you wouldn't be too happy either. \n> you're a disgrace and unprofessional.\n\nUnprofessional yes but a disgrace no. I concede that she should have got parental permission first. In fact, a nurse replied here that they shouldn't do it regardless. But that tooth was coming out sooner or later. I haven't ever heard in my life of anyone going to the dentist to take out a wobbly baby tooth. You wait until it gets very loose then yank it. It hurts a bit because some ligaments are still in tact. It wasn't the nurse being a disgrace that caused (mild and fleeting) pain. It was the tooth coming out. I don't know if you can even call it a medical procedure if it is rarely performed by medical professionals and almost always done by parents or kids themselves. I do think you were right to tell the school you should have been notified or asked. I do believe this case is a non-issue but if the nurse has a pattern of ignoring protocol it should be recorded and the school or her licensing board can act as they see fit.\n\nI also don't think you are teaching your son the right message. How it could have gone: \"Hey dad. I lost a tooth today.\" \n\"Gee wizz son. Did you have to yank it out?\"\n\"I went to the nurse. She looked at it and said it was ready to pull. She actually pulled it out for me.\"\n\"Well I'm glad you were sensible about it. Much better the nurse does it in a hygienic environment, presumably with some sterile pliers. So she can stop if it doesn't want to come and can give you some gauze if it bleeds. Much better that than you or your 7yo friends just yank on a piece of string tied around it. Or worse you come back home with it and I either do the string thing or turn it into a massive drama and book an expensive emergency dentist appointment only for them to just pull it out right away. Leaving me feeling like an idiot for paying $xxx for 5 seconds of chair time. Or it falling out while you were eating and swallowing it. I'm pleased that you sought out the most appropriate help that was available to you.\"\n\"Thanks dad. I've got the tooth here. It did hurt.\"\n\"Yeah they can hurt a bit because you are tearing the remaining ligaments and the gum can be left a little sore. Does it hurt now?\"\n\"No\"\n\"Atta boy [ruffle his hair] Though I am annoyed that I wasn't contacted at all. And although I am grateful to the nurse for being helpful, I don't think they are actually suppossed to do that. I will let the school know that I am thankful but I noticed some protocols weren't followed. Because I am rational and not a helicopter parent who lashes out at any involved figure for imagined maltreatment, I'm not angry. But I can imagine that fundamentalist Christians who deny medical treatment on religious grounds would be annoyed. But I'd prefer to always be kept in the loop, as is standard practice.\"\n\"Sorry dad I stopped listening. Can we have chicken nuggets for dinner?\"\n\nInstead you chose this drama. The school faculty may say that they are obliged to follow through and report it to her licensing body. I doubt it would be a career ending situation in isolation but it will be a big black mark and a lot of stress for her as she awaits results. Maybe she needed the reminder to do things by the book. But next time a kid comes to her with a wobbly tooth I imagine she won't help them. Not sure if you think that is better or worse but I'm sure many kids will think worse and many parents will say \"They are so scared now to do anything in case they get sued.
