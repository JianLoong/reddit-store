Hope she learns from this, but sorry your son had to be the example that will teach her.", "I'm gonna go with NTA. I'm a dentist and I wouldn't pull out a kids' tooth in my office without getting explicit consent from the parent first. Having said that, it is a baby tooth that by all accounts was well on its way out anyway. I cannot tell you how many times a parent or child has come in concerned because \"this tooth isn't even loose yet\" when it is, in fact, quite loose. Point being that it may have been more far gone than you or your son realized. I don't want to minimize any trauma this causes you or your son, but it is unlikely that he suffered severe pain in the pulling, and rest assured he will be ok. Could you have toned down your response a notch? Yes. Was it appropriate to bring this up with the school admin and escalate? Also yes.", "What? Every parent in this world helps their kid lose their baby teeth, not many of them are dentists. Even if the nurse should have contacted you before, it's not that bad that he got it out, you would have pulled it out anyway at home.", "NTA.\n\nShe did something she was NOT cleared to do. Which I'm pretty sure is illegal. What if the tooth wasn't fully ready to come out and something had gone wrong. Your son told you he felt pain  + he was scared.

I dont blame you", "YTA If you are getting so distraught over petty crap, how are you going to handle real issues? All kids lose their baby teeth. Get a grip.", "It's just fucking baby teeth, chill out. \n\nI even doubt it caused him pain. Kids can be liars and assholes. My nephew had a super loose tooth and my Sister was like, \"well if it hurts ill give you five bucks,\" came out in less then a second and then he said it \"hurt\" and then skipped off with his five bucks.\n\nYTA", "Is this his first baby tooth that has ever fallen out? Your reaction seems a bit extreme. After so many fall out, you get kinda numb to it and are actually grateful when they come out fast. My daughter had one that was loose but just would not come out, the adult tooth started growing in behind it making it worse. Eventually we had to go to the dentist to get it pulled because it was messing up the alignment of the new tooth and causing problems. I'd say the nurse did a good thing getting it out, and your son could have been happy looking forward to a visit from the tooth fairy. Instead, your reaction might have scared him about future loose teeth and given him anxiety over something that's completely normal.", "I think pediatric nurses are fairly capable in this regard. Lost teeth always hurt a little and are uncomfortable, but the dude's not traumatized by it. If anything he's likely more traumatized by your overreaction to this. YTA", "YTA. You don't need to be a dentist to help a kid with a loose baby tooth. She's the school nurse. Have some respect. If a dentist was needed, she would have called one. If a janitor had done it, I might have been a bit miffed but to yell at a school nurse like that makes you TA. \n\nThis is not a major medical procedure, you should have thanked the nurse for helping him out and making sure he got the tooth. Otherwise he might have eaten it with his lunch, or accidentally swallowed it and that can actually cause harm. \"She caused him pain\" - we've all survived the trauma of loosing our baby teeth - few of us had a nurse around when it happened, calm down.", "That would be considered physical assault on a minor.\n\n\nAs a medical professional you are not allowed to remove clothing/ glasses/ dentures, hell, you can't even cut someone's hair/beard without express permission.\n\n\nThe ONLY exception is, if the removal is needed for the patients immediate safety. Like performing cpr on someone. Or someone choking, and you remove tight clothing. \n\n\nA patient could potentially sue over a shaved off beard, if they didn't state that they were okay with it (outside of medical emergencies).", "NTA.

I get that\u2019s different, but it\u2019s generally not painless to remove a tooth no matter how loose the tooth is. Lots of parents help their kids pull out loose teeth, hard to imagine the majority of them are dental experts \u2026 didn\u2019t any of you do the tie floss to your tooth and the other end to a door trick when you were kids under your parents guidance? That\u2019s some hillbilly dental care right there, definitely not proper dentist behavior. \n\nImagine if he did choke on it, what would your reaction have been then? Should she have done it considering it\u2019s not within the scope of her job? Probably not. But she made an in good faith judgment call in the moment in an attempt to make sure your kid didn\u2019t get hurt further. Your child will recover from the horrible \u201cpain\u201d she caused, this absolutely didn\u2019t require theatrics or calling for her head.", "NTA. The school nurse did not have permission from either you or your son to remove his tooth. This goes against what we constantly teach kids at this age: nobody is allowed to do something to your body without your permission. Clearly it wasn\u2019t a medical emergency that warranted doing something to him without permission. Nor is it standard protocol to remove the wiggly teeth of elementary students during school hours.  I\u2019ve never heard of anything like this. I would certainly be upset as well.", "YTA. It's just a baby tooth and it was already wobbly. None of my baby teeth were pulled out by dentists. One was done by my parents, one by my school nurse, and the rest I did with my friends - the old tie it with a string to the door and slam it shut, bite an apple etc. We had fun with it, and did the same with the other friends in my class. If kids can pull each others teeth safely (none of us required any medical attention though once or twice we had to use a lot of stuffed tissues when we got a little over zealous) then nurses certainly can.", "NTA\n\nThey hurt your kid.

I still remember in 4th grade (I am in my mid 20\u2019s!) I got bored and started wiggling the next baby tooth in line to come out. Within an hour I got it loose enough to be on a thread. A classmate told me it was gonna hurt when it came out as it wasn\u2019t ready yet. No shit he was right. When it came out the next morning it was a few threads left and it hurt when it came out.", "Slight YTA. I remember going to the nurse in elementary school when I had a wiggly tooth. The school nurse taught me to dry the tooth, pinch it, twist and pull. Worked like a charm every time. I guess I don\u2019t see it as a big deal but I see why some parents would. But your reaction was a bit intense/nuclear.", "YTA. Huge overreaction. Good luck to your kid in that school now. The teachers and the staff are going to hate you and probably, by extension,  your kid.", "When I was about 10 my orthodontist pulled out my last eight baby teeth one day, without my parents consent. Dentists are evil amd I will never be convinced otherwise.", "I had crocodile teeth and had to have 12 teeth pulled by the dentist because my adult teeth didn\u2019t grow over my baby teeth and push them out like they\u2019re supposed to.\n\nOne of my front teeth was literally hanging on by a nerve - once I had the anaesthetic the dentist told me to pull it myself, it was the most satisfying moment of my life at that moment.", ">Otherwise he might have eaten it with his lunch, or accidentally swallowed it and that can actually cause harm.\n\nThat's pretty unlikely to have health consequences.
