You'd rather have frosty/strained social occasions with Lacey and the occasional argument thrown in for good measure? This woman is looking to make amends, you had the potential to have harmony. Do you get a kick out of having drama in your life? You think it's nice for your husband to see you two arguing on the regular when you have to be at the same social event? What about the kid who's life you saved? Does he need to see the woman who saved his life not get on with his mother?\n\nYou had the chance to squash all the BS, have a harmonious future with a woman that seemed to want make amends and you instead went the ass hole route, so your hubby has to deal with  his current and former wife arguing or being passive aggressive to each other every time they are in the same event, the kids have to see it (what kind of lessons will they learn from this?) and the kid who's life you saved sees that their saviour is an AH. Why don't you want a more peaceful life? YTA", "> \"I had to literally save your child's life (which by the way, I did not do for you) in order for you to change your view of me. But I didn't deserve your hatred for all those years, and you deciding that I'm now 'good enough' doesn't magically undo the way you treated me when you thought that I wasn't 'good enough.'\n\nIn my opinion, that's worse than if she just didn't like you for no reason and continued not to like her.\n\nI remember years ago when NYS was deciding on the \"should gay marriage be legal\" question, one of the deciding votes came down to a Republican state legislator that changed his mind after one of his children came out.  \n\nHe was hailed as some sort of hero, but I have always maintained that his change of heart is so much worse.

Saving the kid's life still isn't enough for her ex to reflect on how badly she has handled things.\n\nReality is, ex is pissed that she's the villain and needs something to paint OP badly.
