I'm glad you're cool with the stepkids. I hope she can find a clue & leave you alone.", "NTA. She may be nice until something happens again. Live your life.", "Imagine having the worst thing anyone ever did to you be \u201cwouldn\u2019t be my friend after saving my child\u2019s life, just because I was rude to them for years.\u201d", "I hate that you were downvoted so much. So was I. People don't seem to realize that it might be a little hurtful for the person you married and had 4 kids with to suddenly be with another woman. Also, she acts like she never has to see this person but haven't they needed to (and still need to) coparent all the kids?? Doesn't seem like someone you could just *avoid*. I really feel like theres missing pieces here that paint OP to be perfect and the ex the only problem and thats probably just not true.", "Who said anything about absolution? No one said anything about becoming best friends with the ex. But yea in life circumstances change, people change. And nearly losing your child would make a lot of people re-evaluate their life choices and behavior. This ex isn\u2019t even doing anything that out of ordinary, she is being polite and asking how op is doing and also sent her flowers as a thank you. Meanwhile OP is being an immature bitch thinking this means she is trying to be best friends with her. She needs to grow tf up because if her current behavior is any indication of how she used to behave before, then I am not outright dismissing that the ex was completely unjustified in \u201chating\u201d her.", "> OP is being an immature bitch\n\nNo, if she were immature she would have refused to get tested for marrow compatibility.\n\n\nBlocking you now.", "The boy would\u2019ve been three when they met. And I know people who\u2019ve met and married in a matter of weeks or months. It\u2019s weird but it happens.", ">My husband said I should apologize\n\nWas saving their child not enough?", "NTA you don\u2019t have to be friends with anyone. You are respectful to her and that\u2019s all you need to be. I don\u2019t think you owe her an apology either. \nThis should have been firstly: Thank you for donating your bone marrow for that little boy. You are a hero!", "NTA First of all, it's messed up that she claims that she has a favorite kid, and it makes me wonder if she would be so nice if it was one of her kids that are not her favorite. Second of all, she's only being nice now because you saved her favorite kid. If you had not been a match, she would still be treating you poorly, and then she would go try to be friends with some stranger who donated their marrow. She doesn't wanna be your friend. She just wants to use this experience against you somehow.", "Here is the thing, you would have been unhappy if she didn\u2019t acknowledge/thank you. I am sure that she is genuinely trying to be nice now that you saved her sons life. I feel like Lacey is in a catch-22 with you. If she continued giving you the cold shoulder you would be upset. Now you are upset she is thanking you. It doesn\u2019t even sound like she wants to be friends. She is just grateful you saved her child\u2019s life.\n\nPeople change, especially during hard times. I think you should start this relationship new with her. \n\nYTA", "Why not let her show her gratitude. It won\u2019t make you best friends. Nothing wrong with being cordial. No need to start hanging out together as you are too bitter to make it worthwhile for you both. She got over her bitterness it seems and you took the bitterness baton. Two sides here. She is only one who knows why she had a problem with you. Had she not had a legit reason before, she does now. Jacob I am sure wouldn\u2019t want you both acting nasty to each other. That\u2019s his mother.", "I agree 100%. I feel like many of these comments are very immature.", "Timeline overlaps if stepson is 13. They have been married for 10 years. But when did they start dating? If they didn\u2019t meet for 3 years until after the divorce they must have met and married immediately. Did her husband and ex divorce while she was pregnant? I think OP is lying about why the ex hated her so much.", "But it would be a pretty good reason for the ex wife not to like OP - I would be extremely unhappy if a person was brought into my young children's lives in such a permanent way without any real consideration for the effect it would have on them."]}
