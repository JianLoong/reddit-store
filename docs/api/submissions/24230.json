You owe me years worth of apologies and attempts to make it up to me. But the best way for you to start making it up to me is to leave me alone. The fact that you refuse to do that and are instead trying to make me feel bad for you tends to indicate that you aren't actually sorry for how you treated me.

People look like I'm crazy when I tell them the same thing when I have moved on from their drama.  Stick to what makes you at peace.", "NTA.

No sorry on that, just a statement of fact. \n\nBut if your heart really is so full of hate that you can\u2019t get past it, well I feel sorry for you and your soon to be ex-husband and your kids and your soon to be ex step kids.", "People can change you know? She is doing the effort to say sorry, shouldn't you try too. I don't say let her be your best friend, but for your Patchwork family it's at least worth a try.
