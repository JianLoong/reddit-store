But I didn't deserve your hatred for all those years, and you deciding that I'm now 'good enough' doesn't magically undo the way you treated me when you thought that I wasn't 'good enough.' You owe me years worth of apologies and attempts to make it up to me. But the best way for you to start making it up to me is to leave me alone. The fact that you refuse to do that and are instead trying to make me feel bad for you tends to indicate that you aren't actually sorry for how you treated me. And if you don't regret what you did, then what are we even talking about?\"\n\nNTA. You never owe anyone your friendship. As long as you treat her politely (even if it is distant politeness) whenever your paths cross, you have fulfilled your social obligation.\n\nAnd I'd be curious why your husband thinks you owe her an apology for establishing a legitimate boundary.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to have boundaries and She needs to respect your boundaries.", "OP I agree with you 100% - why in the world can't people respect other people's boundaries?  If you want nothing to do with them, then why can't they leave you alone because you said there's nothing more to say?  The damage has been done, there's no going back to rectify the situation, you came through for Jacob which is what you did as a co-parent, you want life to be as it was before everything happened.  People look like I'm crazy when I tell them the same thing when I have moved on from their drama.  Stick to what makes you at peace.", "NTA. Asking to be left alone and not be guilted about it is not a big ask. And you are owed a favour", "I'm gonna get hate for this but NTA.\n\nThe best thanks she can give is to leave you alone. But she couldn't even do that.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m so glad you were a match for Jacob. Best of luck to him as he recovers.\n\nLacey is feeling gratitude and guilt and all manner of feelings rolled into a ball. It\u2019s great that she\u2019s appreciative of what you did. But it\u2019s not okay for her to insist you be bestest buddy buddies now, and it\u2019s *certainly* not okay for her to claim that you not wanting to be friends is hurtful to her when she\u2019s rejected you from the outset.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be besties with your husband\u2019s ex. That\u2019s a perfectly acceptable boundary. She needs to accept it. And so does your husband.", "NTA.  This person said it better than I can:  https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15m3nw3/aita_for_refusing_to_become_friends_with_my/jveeekr/", "NTA but the way you talked to her makes me ishh. Did he cheat on her with you? Or did you guys get together when they were separated?", "INFO: How soon after they split did you and Chris get together? Did that play into her feelings?\n\nI can't say I am fond of the way you talk about her. \"I am happy and she's not\" and the like.", "I wouldn't say YTA, but I do say Eesh, for handling that without a bit more grace.  I totally understand why you wouldn't want to be friends with her.  I think I would've said basically the same thing but phrased it more softly, like  \"I don't want accolades, I love your kid/s and would do it again in a heartbeat. I don't want an on-going conflict, but I also don't want to stay in touch or be friends.  I won't ever say a word against you in front of your children, but you and I cannot be friends, that ship sailed.  Wish you only the best\"    \nJMO.", "YTA. This woman is the mother of your children\u2019s siblings.  Of course she was hurt that her ex moved on and probably painted you as a witch. Now she has been humbled as she found out you can be a good person. But you are still acting like a bitter witch yourself!  Get over it. Again, this woman is the mother of your children\u2019s siblings! The better your relationship with her, the better it is for your children and your step children. \n\nIf saying the simple words, I\u2019m sorry, is so hard try, hey xxxx we kind of were in a rut of bad feelings and bad communication and you got past it before I did. I reacted in a negative way, and I am ready to move past that.  No sorry on that, just a statement of fact. \n\nBut if your heart really is so full of hate that you can\u2019t get past it, well I feel sorry for you and your soon to be ex-husband and your kids and your soon to be ex step kids.", "People can change you know? She is doing the effort to say sorry, shouldn't you try too. I don't say let her be your best friend, but for your Patchwork family it's at least worth a try. And seriously if your husband would divorce you and found a third family you surely wouldn't love no 3 too.", "ESH - it sucks she was so awful to you, but some people change after huge terrifying life events. I really think you could handle this with a little more kindness. You did something so kind, so loving\u2026and now she sees you in a different light. You don\u2019t have to be friends with her, but it won\u2019t kill you to not run her olive branch through a wood chipper. At the end of the day you\u2019re still helping I parent, so any improvement in this relationship is a good thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
