Attention they can moan about later.", "I was thinking a future estranged relationship also!", "Yup, OP is an asshole. I'm 15 and my sister not only invited me to her childfree wedding, but she also asked me to be her bridesmaid. When they're around that age, surely it can be assumed they won't be loud and obnoxious enough at their mother's wedding to warrant wanting them to be part of the childfree list.", "I know I\u2019m going out on a really long limb here but based on what OP has said about her daughters not attending but still wanting them around, how much do you all want to bet that OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9 may have had a say in that? And OP\u2019s just one of those people who\u2019s trying to be a peacemaker and not offend them? \n\nAgain I know that\u2019s a fairly big stretch but to me OP\u2019s story seems a bit scattered and I feel like there\u2019s some information missing.", "That's a scary good point. Even tho you ment it in jest it really looks like she is deliberately torpedoing anything they might possibly enjoy.", "YTA. And off to a great start in establishing your new family unit, too.", "The OP is the girls' mother.", "MOTHER, not stepmother", "I have to watch someone prep for a wedding I won\u2019t be allowed at?", "You know when I was 14 and 16 I was a clumsy as an ox. It would be such a shame if they accidentally fell and broke the arch, or ripped the decorations, knocked over the glasses for the toast.", "Not just half ass but downright sabotage every task and make their mom feel miserable.", "I didn't realize that was thing but yes definitely!", "I can believe it. I wasn't invited to my mums wedding when I was 12 because I didn't fit the aesthetic like her younger children did. At least I had a wonderful dad who took me on a nice holiday just like this father is trying to do. At least these girls have their dad.", "OP wants them around because the older daughter is making all the decorations. The wedding theme is based on the oldest daughter's favorite movie and she still doesn't get to go. OP is a wicked stepmother without the step.", "I understand that receptions can get rowdy. There can be drinking, drugs, sexual behavior.  Keep kids away from that!  But during a wedding?", "Not to mention Moulin Rouge is currently on Broadway. In New York. Where OP doesn't want her daughters to be at during her wedding week. Between creating decorations themed around your favorite movie but not being able to see them in all their glory during the main event and the possibility of seeing the adaptation of your favorite movie on Broadway, I wonder what the child would pick */s*", "As someone who didn\u2019t get to have the kids she wanted it blows my mind when I read posts like this tbh.", "Oh ya, they are defiantly going no contact as soon as they possibly can. This is nucking futs.", "OP seems to be the mother.\n\nAnd that kinda makes it worse... \n\n(Yeah, equal rights and stuff.. but still..)", "Not just watch, help!", "That is absolutely horrible!!! I can\u2019t even comprehend the thought process that goes into such selfishness!!! I didn\u2019t do a judgement but she\u2019s definitely the AH. Thank you for the extra info.", "Until your booted out when the event actually starts!"]}
