Right. Let's just get rid of the false excuses regarding pretend bonding and get to the real reason you need them for the week. Which is to take care of all the kids, so their parents are able to attend both the wedding and the prewedding celebrations. You don't need your daughters for support. You need unpaid labor for childcare because you don't want to pay for babysitters yourself. I'm assuming you already have \"volunteered\" their services to these parents which is the real reason you're upset about the trip. Because not only will it ruin your perfect plans, but it will also reveal to all the parents that your daughters' neither knew nor consented to this plan. How exactly did you even expect this to work if there'd been no trip to begin with? Did you honestly think they wouldn't refuse or even object, as soon as people started dumbing their kids on them? I'm sure you'll insist that this isn't the case, but you haven't given an explanation as to where they'll even be during the ceremony. So how exactly are we supported to believe your claims of \"bonding\". Back off, let them go, explain to the parents that you lied, and figure the babysitting issue on your own. Otherwise enjoy being taken back to court by your ex where he will get full custody because both girls are well past the age where the judge takes their wants into major account.
