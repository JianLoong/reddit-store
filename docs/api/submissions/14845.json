True white is quite a few steps from ivory. But OP and MIL could easily set dresses close and see how they compare and be more rational on that together.\n\nOP. Are you seriously a virgin? If not, why are you grabbing onto this 'tradition' so firmly? What you learned from Disney films? I'm really going to skip over talking about the origins of that tradition to ask this: is a color dress worn by someone who will be in your life for a very long time worth putting a negative spin on that memory for probably many family members? \n\nTo the MIL I'd ask she remember how she wanted her wedding to be \"just this way\" (whatever her dreams were then) and be more accommodating.
