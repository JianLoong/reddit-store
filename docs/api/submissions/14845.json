This prohibition on anyone else wearing white is a bit ridiculous and really, what is the harm? Are people going to be confused about who the bride is? No, they will not.

Give her a way to wear this dress, honor the hard work she\u2019s doing to get fit and healthy, find a way to make this about your relationship with her and not about your own self. I feel sure there\u2019s a way out of this pickle without seeing it as a hill you\u2019re willing to die on. The bad feelings this will create - has already created - will last a really long time, and you just don\u2019t need to alienate your spouse\u2019s mother.

(I'm sure I'll be downvoted to hell and get told off in the comments, but I just think if someone is important to you and isn't acting through malice, why not try and find a solution/mid ground?)\n\n1. Could she wear something else for the ceremony & photos and wear the white dress for the reception IF that's something you would be comfortable with. You could have some separate photos with her in the special dress so she is able to have something capture the moment - none of the main photos of course \n2. Would she consider having the dress dyed to a pastel shade? Get it professionally done obviously. Then she gets the sentimental part of wearing the dress that's important to her, but it also isn't bloody white! \n3. Would she be open to maybe having some kind of special day out just you and her where you do a few nice things and choose a dress together/try some on?

Everybody knows this, you just don\u2019t. \n\nBe prepared, however, for the possibility of her just turning up in that dress. I\u2019ve seen this happen more than once - people who were told \u2018no you cannot wear an off-white full length evening gown to my wedding (at which I will be wearing an off-white full length evening gown)\u2019 turning up in it on the day - assuming that the couple wouldn\u2019t want to make a fuss at their wedding and would just let it slide. \n\nYou need to decide in advance what you will do if she rocks up in the dress (or the jeans) - and you need to make that decision **with** your OH. Because however you respond has ramifications for your family relationship going forward.\n\nThat sounds dramatic but it\u2019s not just about a dress. It\u2019s a very high-profile, public demonstration of what happens when you set a reasonable boundary that she doesn\u2019t like.

Or be a petty patty and blow it up in a group chat. Ask for style ideas for jeans and what kind of cute top she is going to wear with it. Send her style ideas.\n \nJUST KIDDING, for God's sake, speak to your soon to be spouse about their mother and tell them to deal with it!!!!!!

I'd wager it's her own wedding dress.", "Because unlike suits that come in like 3 colours, most guests wearing dresses have hundreds of shades to choose from.\n\nIf approved by the bride it can be fine. Some brides don't care.\n\nBut in reality if people want to wear a fancy white dress to a wedding they do it knowing it will be seen as a dig at the bride because it usually is.

The mental image is priceless :)", "I think we found the MIL people. NTA OP.", "Exactly. Glad someone said it. Mils dress isn't a wedding dress, like chill a bit, it's just a white dress which most likely is much more simple than the wedding one, ppl can't confuse one with another.", "I mean the MIL is breaking known etiquette by demanding to wear an ivory dress to her son's wedding. She is the one actively trying to cause pain and embarrassment to the bride and groom, as if other dresses do not exist.\n\nShe can get fit and wear another dress; I highly doubt this one dress is the only item she owns or can afford.

It's effectively a shade of  off white. Which will photograph and visually register as white.\n\nMost wedding dreses these days are made in shades of ivory. When I went dress shopping last year I very rarely found a pure white dress.  Many are also now in champagne or darker colours. An ivory dress for a guest will absolutely  give wedding dress vibes and look inappropriate at a wedding. \n\nVisually, ivory appears white. So us all bickering about it not being EXACTLY white is pointless.
