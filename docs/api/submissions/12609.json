Even if you ask. Because you were already in an argument, she wouldn't have felt comfortable disclosing to you\n\n\nYou're overall NTA, but you're flat out wrong if you think you can EVER be certain about someone else's abuse history", "NTA but I\u2019ll be honest I wont see a male OBGYN. I could be in the minority, but it\u2019s just something I don\u2019t feel comfortable with. That being said I don\u2019t have a problem with male OBGYNs. I am sure most women don\u2019t care. I once read that it\u2019s one of the best professions for doctors because many conditions are treatable and you get to deliver babies! I say if you want to do it then do it and don\u2019t worry about your friend or what anyone thinks. Many of my friends have male OBGYNs and couldn\u2019t care less!", "NTA, she made a blatantly sexist comment and you called her out.", "Oh dear god, your \u201cfriend\u201d should keep her opinions to herself. Good for you for pursuing whatever medical specialty you want. You aren\u2019t being \u201cweird and creepy\u201d. \n\nWhat do you think she might say about surgeons? That they like gory slasher/horror movies and they want to just revel in blood and guts and cut *cut* **cut**?\u2026Do you see how ridiculous that sounds?  And NTA.", "NTA. How can your friend come to such a conclusion? We went from treating women badly to looking at men as the creepy gender. Why can't we stay in the middle? Equality!", "Undeniably, NTA. It's a pretty gross generalization that she made and you corrected her on that. I don't see why you should doubt yourself at all. Although I can see why some women would be uncomfortable with a male OBGYN, it obviously doesn't make the male doctors weirdos or creeps.", "I am a male, but at least 2 of my SO's prefer male gynes ovet females. They are usually \"softer\".\n\nBut yeah, she is wrong.", "I\u2019m a woman and I would never want to see a male gynecologist or have a Pap smear from someone who doesn\u2019t know how terrible it feels. It\u2019s not about assuming you\u2019re a creep but I still wouldn\u2019t want you.", "NTA I have had several male OB/GYNs in addition to female ones and never had a problem. For them, it's just like treating any other body part and not sexual at all. The person you were arguing with was being sexist and judgemental.", "A good friend of mine is a gay male OB-GYN. Does he count? He is a wonderful doc.", "NTA\n\nMen and women can do whatever job they want to do. Equal opportunity folks.\n\nNothing sexual about the human body when you\u2019re in medicine.", "NTA.  Judgmental people will find ways to judge, its a symptom of esteem issues.  You let her know the truth.  Now let it go and don't give this any more energy.", "NTA. She is narrow minded.\n\nI used to only see women due to prior trauma, but when a reproductive and debilitating condition arose I opted for the best person in that specialty, who was a male. I was nervous but he had the bedside manner of any doctor I\u2019ve seen, and after 8 years, 4 surgeries, and the ability to have kids I couldn\u2019t be more appreciative to him for taking on that specialty.", "I don't think you're TA for how you reacted and she's def overcorrecting here.  However, as a woman, I personally do not feel comfortable going to a male gynecologist.  Take that however you wish, there are def women who don't agree with me.  I'm sure there are a lot of very professional and respectful male gynecologists.", "Best OB/GYN I ever had was a male. He also drives really fast. I know this because I ended up going into the hospital a 9.5 centimeters dilated with both my deliveries with him.", "NTA and as a 50+ woman who has seen both male and female doctors for my period issues,  smears, and contraception. I find males in general listen better and are less dismissive.  Had one awesome female Doctor who had period issues herself. Others made me feel like I was complaining for nothing as it's something 'we all go through'", "NTA. One surprising reason doctors choose the specialties they do is because they have an incredibly good mentor or advisor. They may not be as interested in the specialty at first, but it's the people. The specialty kind of grows on them.", "NTA she should be apologizing to you and those friends should not have said to let it go and move on. You have your opinion on the topic too just like anyone else and that person should have respected it. She should not have judged men for wanting to become a gynecologist. Anyone can do the job. When I was 18 my gynecologist was a male and he was nice but did his job and my mom had him as her gynecologist too.", "NTA at all -- she was rude about this and it's great you want to go into this field, but I think you should be a lot more mindful moving forward about the fact that many women would not feel safe with a male GYN and her seemingly judgmental opinion could be stemming from her own fear. Statistically, women are far more likely to be abused by male doctors over female doctors, experience trauma by their male doctor, specifically by Gyn, etc. They are also less likely to have their pain taken seriously. Just because you have met lovely male GYNs doesn't mean that she or other women have. Don't assume that any woman including your friend \"probably hasn't experienced this\" just because she hasn't told you about it. I can share countless stories of such from myself and peers. Assuming you already know the studies to back this all up, I think you can move forward from this conversation with greater empathy, not attaching to defensiveness, and a greater sense of responsibility to do good. This is not the last time you will experience this stance. If you can move away from viewing this conversation as an attack on your character, I think you could really grow to be a great physician who is wonderful at empathizing with the concerns of your patients. Best of luck to you.", "Nta. Without ignoring male predators, what she said is insulting to you and to other men in your profession.\n\nPoint of interest about the sex of health care professionals. One of commenters mentioned some women preferring male gynaecologists. I'm a man and tend to prefer female doctors or nurses - it just feels more natural to be vulnerable in front of someone of the opposite sex.", "NTA. She made a really offensive generalization. Some women aren\u2019t comfortable with a male OB/GYN, and that\u2019s ok. Some women are comfortable with a male. My OB/GYN is male. I wouldn\u2019t want to be treated by anyone else. His compassion through our pregnancy loss was amazing. I have been examined by females. Worst experience that I had was with a female doctor. (Lots of \u201cthat doesn\u2019t hurt\u201d, then insisted that I couldn\u2019t possibly have a UTI but it must be an STD and the tests were wrong. A couple days later I ended up at the ER. It was a very bad UTI that had spread to my kidneys. The ER doc was livid.)", "NAH, that was rude of her, but not completely uncalled for. I personally have a male gyno, simply because I had a lot of recommendations for him and when i met him, he was super kind and helped my anxiety a lot. But not only is that not the case for most male gynecologists, the norm is more the opposite. \n\nAnd your reaction honestly tells me a bit about how you feel about women voicing their opinions. And if you're going to go into that field, you need to understand that there will be MANY women who refuse to see you simply because you're a man, and you need to accept that. Also understand that just because you would never do something abhorrent, that doesn't mean every man would do the same.", "NTA I won't ever see a male gynaecologist unless I'm dying. I personally don't get what it is that makes men want to go into it if it isn't about looking at vaginas all day but at the end of the day, they can do what they want. Not saying women are better, I have pcos and the shit I've dealt with from female gynaecologists is crazy, but at least I know that if they try to assault me I have a good chance of defending myself.", "I'm a woman, I have had male and female OBGYNs, and because of my schedule, I'll just take whoever is available in the practice plus some things can't wait. The practice I go to always asks if I would prefer a male or female doctor and they have a policy of a female nurse present when the doctor is male.\n\nTo me, you are NTA; however, I do agree with your friends that you should drop the subject. Your friend who made the comment isn't going to change her view by you trying to pursue the topic. It sounds like she made a broad generalized accusation somewhat off the cuff, and when you responded, the two of you both dug in. \n\nI do think YWBTA if you didn't look at  being a male OBGYN from the perspective of a woman, being in the stirrups is a vulnerable feeling and it's not exactly fun making small talk while you get a pap smear or the speculum isn't placed just right. So, if this is the field you wish to pursue, take a page from your own book. Try not to be narrow-minded if patients prefer to have a female doctor.", "ESH.  Only because your post sounds like you got very heated and angry, you could tell her she was wrong without going all attack mode on her. \n\nI think it is a common enough misperception that you could have just corrected her.  \n\nOne of my AFAB kids asked me this last week actually, why would a guy want to be a gynecologist.  I said lots of doctors love to deliver babies and help women be healthy, but there have been movies that demonize male gynecologists and the fact that Bill Cosby played one on tv doesn't help them out either.  \n\nJeremy Irons was in that creepy movie and I know it hit my subconscious.  Maybe it hit your friends too.", "NTA This is her hang up and ignorance, not yours Could you have let it slide?  Yes. You're human and you reacted.  She put all male ob/gyn's in the same neat little perv box when that's not the case at all.", "NTA.\nIf this was ANY other generalization, people would be grabbing their pitchforks and talking about how you can\u2019t let injustice and stereotypes stand. And if you are silent, you\u2019re complicit.\n\nWhy would this be any different? \n\nYes, there are plenty of women who are uncomfortable going to a male gynecologist. I prefer to see a female one when available. But my second favorite gynecologist was male and delivered my son. In the end, I just want quality medical care.\n\nOur office asks all its patients if they would like to have a chaperone in the room (whether the provider is female or male) for everyone\u2019s protection. The patient can decline.", "NAH bc of the number of male gynos that have been accused by multiple patients of assault.

For centuries, giving birth was a female only event. For centuries, the medical field wasn't open to women unless they were a midwife. Fast forward to male doctors dismissing women's general medical complaints because, well, they are women.  Then, fast forward again to the creation of the diaphragm and the pill and imagine the comments of narrow-minded male doctors. \n\nThere is a bit of distrust and gender bias built in.

Imagine holding your hand up like you are saying stop.  That is reject mode where what the person is saying to you defaults to being rejected or not heard.  Then turn your hand like it is like you are doing a chop.  In receiving mode what they are saying gets through by default and can be considered.  \n\nWhen you are trying to get information or correction into someone you have a much stronger chance if they are in receiving mode rather than rejecting mode.

For example during pregnancy.\nFor me, i dont see male or female, i see a doctor, and all i care is he/she a good doctor.", "NTA, but I never go to male doctors for female related care.

I've only had one appointment with the new doctor and so far she seems ok but suddenly I'm getting charged for the meds I've been taking for years so now I have to figure out the cause of that!\n\nAnyways both of you have interesting points to make and while I don't outright agree with her views I understand why she would feel that way. At the same time I've heard of female gynos being really judgy and rude towards fellow female patients, and I've also heard of creepy male doctors which is why I'm mixed on this. In my personal view, anyone can choose a specific doctor for any reason, but I agree that their personal comfort is the most important one! \n\nJust take this experience into account when you graduate and finally enter the medical world as an actual doctor or nurse.

Some were reassuring and gentle, some were rather cold and rather rough. I had a tumour removed on the cervix. Then I had to go again for a biopsy for womb cancer and I had to have a guy. I was rather nervous, but my goodness he spent a long while going through stuff with me first, really listening to me and was very gentle and reassuring. He then went through my options afterwards. I ended up having a negative result for cancer but he just didn't like it based on everything he had seen and what I had said of symptoms etc and decided to do some further testing with his team and have a camera. It was endo. They were a team of women and they were impatient and rather harsh and I ended up fainting from the pain. So all in all if I had to pick just one of the people I had seen it was the guy for his professional, compassionate manner. My second choice was a very gentle female doctor with tiny hands lol.

OP, you're NTA but honestly, I would think carefully about this specialty for this different reason. I don't object to men becoming gynecologists on principle (and if anything I think the specialty probably reduces interest in women's genitalia, rather than sexually excites them; I mean, you'd spend all your time seeing medical problems and birth-ripping in that area, haha), but I would never willingly see a male OBGYN, and I would be unhappy if I was forced to. (Forced due to, say, lack of female OBGYNs available, I guess if maybe fewer were successful in competing for limited spots against male OBGYNs). \n\nSeeing an OBGYN is a very private and intimidating experience and I would expect that the majority of women would prefer to see a female OBGYN, just as a reflex.

Would she argue he isn't allowed to do that despite his own personal familiarity with the reproductive system OBGYNs care for, or would that somehow \"not count\" for her because she's assuming this rigid gender/sex construct?

My hysterectomy was done by a male Dr, and I had the best recovery. He even drained a hematoma off my side in the most gentle and reassuring manner. \n\nI don't think about gender of my doctors. I focus on the relationship and how they listen to me. I have a very high pain tolerance, so explaining to people that just because I am calmly sitting here talking to you doesn't mean I am not in the worst pain. I still remember going to the ER for abdominal pain. They didn't believe I was in pain and let me walk into the CT scan room. I was talking with the tech and suddenly she got super quiet. They then called immediately for a wheelchair and refused to let me get up. She found that my appendix was perforated and about to explode. I was in surgery within 45 mins.

Over the course of the trip the guide asked the doc what it was like, you know, looking at women daily. The doc thought for a moment and answered, \"It's a lot like chopping wood\".

Realistically thinking through realistic barriers is an important part of the process of making life-changing decisions like which medical specialty to invest years of your life and thousands of dollars into locking in. \n\nIf you think I shouldn't have the right to my own preferences... I don't care? And if you're mad to find out that a majority of women are different from you, I don't care about that, either.

(And women don't even need to have preferences that 'serious' as sexual assault trauma or religious/cultural norms, to have a right to choose a female over male Ob/Gyn if they want. It's a woman's right to make that choice for herself, she doesn't have to justify herself to you, and you don't get to tell women they're wrong for preferring it or that simple by telling the truth about her preference she's somehow \"feeding into generalizations\" and somehow causing harm. ) \n\nSo, uh, keep downvoting me for no obvious reason, Reddit.

I assume you'll extend me the same courtesy.\n\nBy the way, I never claimed to \"speak for all women.\" I just pointed out that a ***majority*** of women prefer a female Ob/Gyn, which is just literally true. (Check out the 2016 meta-analysis of 26 studies by Tobler et al.) Studies show that the majority of women *say* they prefer a female Ob/Gyn. This isn't about insulting men, it's just a preference women are *allowed* to have, and do in fact have a majority of the time.\n\nNothing I said in my comment was false, or mean, or in anyway unsupportive of male Ob/Gyns or other women. I was just giving the OP honest feedback to think about because this is a very important choice in his life and he has a right to hear realistic thoughts and be encouraged to think carefully about such an important choice, not just think idealistic thoughts and rush carelessly into such an important choice. But I even said I hopes he becomes a great Ob/Gyn if he chooses that path. Just, I actually care about the doctor in this situation too, and being a doctor is freaking HARD. Choosing a specialty with potential additional difficulties on the basis of something you can't change (like being male when the patient population self-reports that a majority of them will choose a female for this role if he finds himself competing against her for patients), is just something to make sure you're ready to tackle and overcome, counting the cost at the start rather than stumbling in blindly and being surprised by it later. \n\nI'd appreciate not being deliberately misinterpreted by redditors on the subject.

I've seen over two dozen OBGYNs and had to search through so many and deal with so much forced-birther and misogynistic bullshit from OBGYNs. But the doctor that performed my hysterectomy, and later the surgeon who was the only OBGYN to recognize my PCOS was severe and saved my life by removing lesions obstructing my bowels through an ovariectomy and cleanup surgery 6 months ago were both men. Unlike female OBGYNs I've been to, they did not give me any shit about how I'd \"want to have children one day\" - which was the basis for most the women to refuse to treat me.\n\nBest OBGYNs I had were male. They were incredibly kind and understanding. And they had so much less investment in the idea of \"baby fever\" and women being born just to incubate children. I've recommended my OBGYN surgeon to others who don't normally see male OBGYNs and they've loved him.\n\nI want to say NTA, because you're right, painting every male OBGYN as a pervert is ridiculous. But you also need to remember that there *are* many predators who pursue careers with access like that. Dismissing her concerns entirely as false is also a bit tone-deaf to the issues that women face in medical care. We still have so many incidents of teaching hospitals letting their students run through pelvic exams while a patient is under anasthesia for unrelated issues without their consent. It's a very serious problem. I'd recommend you look into how to better advocate for women and recognize that there is nuance here - these fears are *not* unfounded in women and they exist in the real world.

You allowed your (justifiable) anger blind you to a reality that far too many female patients face. There *are* plenty of male doctors and male OBGYNs who take advantage of their patients, and that needs to be acknowledged so that it can be corrected. You're also wrong about two things:\n\n>I'm quite sure that she never experienced such a thing herself\n\nNo you're not. You're assuming.\n\n>I happen to have met a few gynecologists during my studies and have met some of the nicest and most sensitive doctors.\n\nMaybe they were, but if they really were predators do you really think that *you* would know? Creeps generally know not to be creeps around other men (who are not creeps). \n\nSo basically she was definitely more wrong than you were, but you should take this as a learning moment, especially if you plan to become an OB: even without straight-up abuse, a far too common experience for women is general is just not being taken seriously by their doctors.", "I have a male OBGyn & I love him.

Him telling me what my cycle should feel like didn\u2019t sit right with me.  I saw a female gynecologist and was diagnosed on the first appointment.

Two changes of clinics were due to insurance provider changes. They both had multiple OBGYNs on staff, and you rotated through each one at least once during your pregnancy so you had at least met the OBGYN on call when you went into labor. I only had one female and probably was seen by at least 14 males. They were all polite, knowledgeable, willing to spend time making sure my questions were answered. The OBGYN that delivered my 9#15oz butt first daughter was the only doctor of any specialty that ever apologized to me for anything. He apologized for not doing an emergency C-section because he did not think she was as large as she was. This was the only time I had ever met him.

I am a woman who has had two kids. I have been to the Gyno more times than I can count.  I have always seen women, but by default because I have always seen midwives.  However, I had a lot of urinary related issues after the delivery of my first and have gotten very familiar with a urologist, who is a man.  He is one of the most kind, caring, and knowledgeable doctors I have ever met.  I ended up having some testing and surgeries that required him to be very\u2026involved with my nether regions.  \n\nSome people cannot take sexuality out of it.  They immediately assume that if a man is a gyno, then they *must* be doing it for sexual reasons.  Typically these people are uneducated as to how medical specialties work - and what advantages there might be in that field over another.  They also just see: \u201ca Gyno looks at vaginas all day\u201d without considering everything else gynecologist is responsible for.  Most gynecologists are not just doing Pap smears, and breast exams all day long \n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that there aren\u2019t some pervy or inappropriate people out there - but it isn\u2019t limited to men.  I feel like the stigma around men being gynecologists started a long time ago - before society became more open to different sexualities.  Many years ago, women who were anti-men gynecologists, felt safer with a woman because they couldn\u2019t possibly be sexualized by another woman.  That is less true today.  But the stereotype has stuck around. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that women cannot prefer a woman doctor. Some women are just more comfortable with another woman. Some women feel like another woman would understand and sympathize more because their doctor has likely gone through the same things they are, and know first hand.  Whatever the reason, they\u2019re entitled to their choice.  \n\nYour friend deserves to be told she was wrong. She is making and perpetuating a stereotype. Unbeknownst to her, she was also insulting you. It is horribly unfair to make a blanket statement that ANY men who want to be gynos are disgusting pervs.  To go as far as to say they have an \u201cinborn obsession with women\u2019s sex\u201d are \u201ccreepy\u201d and \u201care likely to abuse a patient\u201d is ignorant.  It sounds like she is basing all of this on opinion and hearsay, not on facts.  Of course there have been cases of abuse, but compared to the amount of male doctors out there, it\u2019s likely a very small percentage.  If she doubles down on it, ask for some facts or studies proving her point.  You did nothing but defend yourself and an entire population of doctors out there. \n\nSide note: I bet if you look up amount of sexual assaults by doctors, many wouldn\u2019t be by gynecologists.  It would be spread throughout all areas because at the end of the day, there\u2019s shitty people everywhere.", "NTA, whatever her history may or may not be it doesn't make it right to put it on an entire gender that they should be banned from the specialty. It is very rude to assume such things without cause.   \n\n\nHonestly I have only seen a male gyny for decades now because I overheard the female one from prior to that mocking me to the nurses in the hallway after an appointment. Judgemental b\\*tch. Whereas my current doctor has been incredibly kind, respectful, and open to listening to me no matter how small my concerns might seem. He is awesome. So I'm very glad your friend doesn't get an actual say in who can be what.   \n\n\nAnd if this is the medicine you want to get into then good luck!
