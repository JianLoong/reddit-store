Even if you ask. Because you were already in an argument, she wouldn't have felt comfortable disclosing to you\n\n\nYou're overall NTA, but you're flat out wrong if you think you can EVER be certain about someone else's abuse history", "NTA but I\u2019ll be honest I wont see a male OBGYN. I could be in the minority, but it\u2019s just something I don\u2019t feel comfortable with. That being said I don\u2019t have a problem with male OBGYNs. I am sure most women don\u2019t care. I once read that it\u2019s one of the best professions for doctors because many conditions are treatable and you get to deliver babies! I say if you want to do it then do it and don\u2019t worry about your friend or what anyone thinks. Many of my friends have male OBGYNs and could care less!", "NTA, she made a blatantly sexist comment and you called her out.", "Oh dear god, your \u201cfriend\u201d should keep her opinions to herself. Good for you for pursuing whatever medical specialty you want. You aren\u2019t being \u201cweird and creepy\u201d. \n\nWhat do you think she might say about surgeons? That they like gory slasher/horror movies and they want to just revel in blood and guts and cut *cut* **cut**?\u2026Do you see how ridiculous that sounds?  And NTA.", "NTA. How can your friend come to such a conclusion? We went from treating women badly to looking at men as the creepy gender. Why can't we stay in the middle? Equality!", "Undeniably, NTA. It's a pretty gross generalization that she made and you corrected her on that. I don't see why you should doubt yourself at all. Although I can see why some women would be uncomfortable with a male OBGYN, it obviously doesn't make the male doctors weirdos or creeps.", "I am a male, but at least 2 of my SO's prefer male gynes ovet females. They are usually \"softer\".\n\nBut yeah, she is wrong.", "I\u2019m a woman and I would never want to see a male gynecologist or have a Pap smear from someone who doesn\u2019t know how terrible it feels. It\u2019s not about assuming you\u2019re a creep but I still wouldn\u2019t want you.", "NTA I have had several male OB/GYNs in addition to female ones and never had a problem. For them, it's just like treating any other body part and not sexual at all. The person you were arguing with was being sexist and judgemental.", "A good friend of mine is a gay male OB-GYN. Does he count? He is a wonderful doc.", "NTA\n\nMen and women can do whatever job they want to do. Equal opportunity folks.\n\nNothing sexual about the human body when you\u2019re in medicine.", "NTA.  Judgmental people will find ways to judge, its a symptom of esteem issues.  You let her know the truth.  Now let it go and don't give this any more energy.", "NTA. She is narrow minded.\n\nI used to only see women due to prior trauma, but when a reproductive and debilitating condition arose I opted for the best person in that specialty, who was a male. I was nervous but he had the bedside manner of any doctor I\u2019ve seen, and after 8 years, 4 surgeries, and the ability to have kids I couldn\u2019t be more appreciative to him for taking on that specialty.", "I don't think you're TA for how you reacted and she's def overcorrecting here.  However, as a woman, I personally do not feel comfortable going to a male gynecologist.  Take that however you wish, there are def women who don't agree with me.  I'm sure there are a lot of very professional and respectful male gynecologists.", "Best OB/GYN I ever had was a male. He also drives really fast. I know this because I ended up going into the hospital a 9.5 centimeters dilated with both my deliveries with him.", "NTA and as a 50+ woman who has seen both male and female doctors for my period issues,  smears, and contraception. I find males in general listen better and are less dismissive.  Had one awesome female Doctor who had period issues herself. Others made me feel like I was complaining for nothing as it's something 'we all go through'", "NTA. One surprising reason doctors choose the specialties they do is because they have an incredibly good mentor or advisor. They may not be as interested in the specialty at first, but it's the people. The specialty kind of grows on them.", "NTA she should be apologizing to you and those friends should not have said to let it go and move on. You have your opinion on the topic too just like anyone else and that person should have respected it. She should not have judged men for wanting to become a gynecologist. Anyone can do the job. When I was 18 my gynecologist was a male and he was nice but did his job and my mom had him as her gynecologist too.", "NTA at all -- she was rude about this and it's great you want to go into this field, but I think you should be a lot more mindful moving forward about the fact that many women would not feel safe with a male GYN and her seemingly judgmental opinion could be stemming from her own fear. Statistically, women are far more likely to be abused by male doctors over female doctors, experience trauma by their male doctor, specifically by Gyn, etc. They are also less likely to have their pain taken seriously. Just because you have met lovely male GYNs doesn't mean that she or other women have. Don't assume that any woman including your friend \"probably hasn't experienced this\" just because she hasn't told you about it. I can share countless stories of such from myself and peers. Assuming you already know the studies to back this all up, I think you can move forward from this conversation with greater empathy, not attaching to defensiveness, and a greater sense of responsibility to do good. This is not the last time you will experience this stance. If you can move away from viewing this conversation as an attack on your character, I think you could really grow to be a great physician who is wonderful at empathizing with the concerns of your patients. Best of luck to you.", "Nta. Without ignoring male predators, what she said is insulting to you and to other men in your profession.\n\nPoint of interest about the sex of health care professionals. One of commenters mentioned some women preferring male gynaecologists. I'm a man and tend to prefer female doctors or nurses - it just feels more natural to be vulnerable in front of someone of the opposite sex.", "NTA. She made a really offensive generalization. Some women aren\u2019t comfortable with a male OB/GYN, and that\u2019s ok. Some women are comfortable with a male. My OB/GYN is male. I wouldn\u2019t want to be treated by anyone else. His compassion through our pregnancy loss was amazing. I have been examined by females. Worst experience that I had was with a female doctor. (Lots of \u201cthat doesn\u2019t hurt\u201d, then insisted that I couldn\u2019t possibly have a UTI but it must be an STD and the tests were wrong. A couple days later I ended up at the ER. It was a very bad UTI that had spread to my kidneys. The ER doc was livid.)", "NAH, that was rude of her, but not completely uncalled for. I personally have a male gyno, simply because I had a lot of recommendations for him and when i met him, he was super kind and helped my anxiety a lot. But not only is that not the case for most male gynecologists, the norm is more the opposite. \n\nAnd your reaction honestly tells me a bit about how you feel about women voicing their opinions. And if you're going to go into that field, you need to understand that there will be MANY women who refuse to see you simply because you're a man, and you need to accept that. Also understand that just because you would never do something abhorrent, that doesn't mean every man would do the same.", "NTA I won't ever see a male gynaecologist unless I'm dying. I personally don't get what it is that makes men want to go into it if it isn't about looking at vaginas all day but at the end of the day, they can do what they want. Not saying women are better, I have pcos and the shit I've dealt with from female gynaecologists is crazy, but at least I know that if they try to assault me I have a good chance of defending myself.", "I'm a woman, I have had male and female OBGYNs, and because of my schedule, I'll just take whoever is available in the practice plus some things can't wait. The practice I go to always asks if I would prefer a male or female doctor and they have a policy of a female nurse present when the doctor is male.\n\nTo me, you are NTA; however, I do agree with your friends that you should drop the subject. Your friend who made the comment isn't going to change her view by you trying to pursue the topic. It sounds like she made a broad generalized accusation somewhat off the cuff, and when you responded, the two of you both dug in. \n\nI do think YWBTA if you didn't look at  being a male OBGYN from the perspective of a woman, being in the stirrups is a vulnerable feeling and it's not exactly fun making small talk while you get a pap smear or the speculum isn't placed just right. So, if this is the field you wish to pursue, take a page from your own book. Try not to be narrow-minded if patients prefer to have a female doctor.", "ESH.  Only because your post sounds like you got very heated and angry, you could tell her she was wrong without going all attack mode on her. \n\nI think it is a common enough misperception that you could have just corrected her.  \n\nOne of my AFAB kids asked me this last week actually, why would a guy want to be a gynecologist.  I said lots of doctors love to deliver babies and help women be healthy, but there have been movies that demonize male gynecologists and the fact that Bill Cosby played one on tv doesn't help them out either.  \n\nJeremy Irons was in that creepy movie and I know it hit my subconscious.  Maybe it hit your friends too.", "NTA This is her hang up and ignorance, not yours Could you have let it slide?  Yes. You're human and you reacted.  She put all male ob/gyn's in the same neat little perv box when that's not the case at all.", "NTA.\nIf this was ANY other generalization, people would be grabbing their pitchforks and talking about how you can\u2019t let injustice and stereotypes stand. And if you are silent, you\u2019re complicit.\n\nWhy would this be any different? \n\nYes, there are plenty of women who are uncomfortable going to a male gynecologist. I prefer to see a female one when available. But my second favorite gynecologist was male and delivered my son. In the end, I just want quality medical care.\n\nOur office asks all its patients if they would like to have a chaperone in the room (whether the provider is female or male) for everyone\u2019s protection. The patient can decline.", "NAH bc of the number of male gynos that have been accused by multiple patients of assault.

For centuries, giving birth was a female only event. For centuries, the medical field wasn't open to women unless they were a midwife. Fast forward to male doctors dismissing women's general medical complaints because, well, they are women.  Then, fast forward again to the creation of the diaphragm and the pill and imagine the comments of narrow-minded male doctors. \n\nThere is a bit of distrust and gender bias built in.

Might be worth pointing it out to her, you know?", "I definitely think it depends on the doctor.

Imagine holding your hand up like you are saying stop.  That is reject mode where what the person is saying to you defaults to being rejected or not heard.  Then turn your hand like it is like you are doing a chop.  In receiving mode what they are saying gets through by default and can be considered.  \n\nWhen you are trying to get information or correction into someone you have a much stronger chance if they are in receiving mode rather than rejecting mode.  So you want to get them to switch to receive mode if you can.  You also want to make sure that you are in receive mode yourself so you assume the person is not evil or wrong but you try to understand where they are coming from so you can rationally converse.  \n\nAttacking someone puts them in strong reject mode.  \n\nThink about it like pokemon type advantage.  It doesn't mean you are going to convince anyone but you have a much better chance if you can actually get them to listen.  \n\nSorry for blathering on.  I do think it is certain that the woman speaking nonsense had been sexually harassed because basically all women have we just move on most of the time.  Whatever.  I am guessing all guys get creeped on too but don't know since I am not one and don't have tons of experience with guys talking about that stuff happening to them.  So it isn't a stretch that the woman might be reacting to a trauma.  Who knows unless you listen.  \n\nOr maybe she just saw that Jeremy Irons movie that creeped me out for years so I couldn't go to a male gyno, unfortunately true but it was really creepy."]}
