Even if you ask. Because you were already in an argument, she wouldn't have felt comfortable disclosing to you\n\n\nYou're overall NTA, but you're flat out wrong if you think you can EVER be certain about someone else's abuse history", "NTA but I\u2019ll be honest I wont see a male OBGYN. I could be in the minority, but it\u2019s just something I don\u2019t feel comfortable with. That being said I don\u2019t have a problem with male OBGYNs. I am sure most women don\u2019t care. I once read that it\u2019s one of the best professions for doctors because many conditions are treatable and you get to deliver babies! I say if you want to do it then do it and don\u2019t worry about your friend or what anyone thinks. Many of my friends have male OBGYNs and could care less!", "NTA, she made a blatantly sexist comment and you called her out.", "Oh dear god, your \u201cfriend\u201d should keep her opinions to herself. Good for you for pursuing whatever medical specialty you want. You aren\u2019t being \u201cweird and creepy\u201d. \n\nWhat do you think she might say about surgeons? That they like gory slasher/horror movies and they want to just revel in blood and guts and cut *cut* **cut**?\u2026Do you see how ridiculous that sounds?  And NTA.", "NTA. How can your friend come to such a conclusion? We went from treating women badly to looking at men as the creepy gender. Why can't we stay in the middle? Equality!", "Undeniably, NTA. It's a pretty gross generalization that she made and you corrected her on that. I don't see why you should doubt yourself at all. Although I can see why some women would be uncomfortable with a male OBGYN, it obviously doesn't make the male doctors weirdos or creeps.", "I am a male, but at least 2 of my SO's prefer male gynes ovet females. They are usually \"softer\".\n\nBut yeah, she is wrong.", "I\u2019m a woman and I would never want to see a male gynecologist or have a Pap smear from someone who doesn\u2019t know how terrible it feels. It\u2019s not about assuming you\u2019re a creep but I still wouldn\u2019t want you.", "NTA I have had several male OB/GYNs in addition to female ones and never had a problem. For them, it's just like treating any other body part and not sexual at all. The person you were arguing with was being sexist and judgemental.", "A good friend of mine is a gay male OB-GYN. Does he count? He is a wonderful doc.", "NTA\n\nMen and women can do whatever job they want to do. Equal opportunity folks.\n\nNothing sexual about the human body when you\u2019re in medicine.", "NTA.  Judgmental people will find ways to judge, its a symptom of esteem issues.  You let her know the truth.  Now let it go and don't give this any more energy.", "NTA. She is narrow minded.\n\nI used to only see women due to prior trauma, but when a reproductive and debilitating condition arose I opted for the best person in that specialty, who was a male. I was nervous but he had the bedside manner of any doctor I\u2019ve seen, and after 8 years, 4 surgeries, and the ability to have kids I couldn\u2019t be more appreciative to him for taking on that specialty.", "I don't think you're TA for how you reacted and she's def overcorrecting here.  However, as a woman, I personally do not feel comfortable going to a male gynecologist.  Take that however you wish, there are def women who don't agree with me.  I'm sure there are a lot of very professional and respectful male gynecologists.", "Best OB/GYN I ever had was a male. He also drives really fast. I know this because I ended up going into the hospital a 9.5 centimeters dilated with both my deliveries with him.", "NTA and as a 50+ woman who has seen both male and female doctors for my period issues,  smears, and contraception. I find males in general listen better and are less dismissive.  Had one awesome female Doctor who had period issues herself. Others made me feel like I was complaining for nothing as it's something 'we all go through'", "NTA. One surprising reason doctors choose the specialties they do is because they have an incredibly good mentor or advisor. They may not be as interested in the specialty at first, but it's the people. The specialty kind of grows on them.", "NTA she should be apologizing to you and those friends should not have said to let it go and move on. You have your opinion on the topic too just like anyone else and that person should have respected it. She should not have judged men for wanting to become a gynecologist. Anyone can do the job. When I was 18 my gynecologist was a male and he was nice but did his job and my mom had him as her gynecologist too.", "NTA at all -- she was rude about this and it's great you want to go into this field, but I think you should be a lot more mindful moving forward about the fact that many women would not feel safe with a male GYN and her seemingly judgmental opinion could be stemming from her own fear. Statistically, women are far more likely to be abused by male doctors over female doctors, experience trauma by their male doctor, specifically by Gyn, etc. They are also less likely to have their pain taken seriously. Just because you have met lovely male GYNs doesn't mean that she or other women have. Don't assume that any woman including your friend \"probably hasn't experienced this\" just because she hasn't told you about it. I can share countless stories of such from myself and peers. Assuming you already know the studies to back this all up, I think you can move forward from this conversation with greater empathy, not attaching to defensiveness, and a greater sense of responsibility to do good. This is not the last time you will experience this stance. If you can move away from viewing this conversation as an attack on your character, I think you could really grow to be a great physician who is wonderful at empathizing with the concerns of your patients. Best of luck to you.", "Nta. Without ignoring male predators, what she said is insulting to you and to other men in your profession.\n\nPoint of interest about the sex of health care professionals. One of commenters mentioned some women preferring male gynaecologists. I'm a man and tend to prefer female doctors or nurses - it just feels more natural to be vulnerable in front of someone of the opposite sex.", "NTA. She made a really offensive generalization. Some women aren\u2019t comfortable with a male OB/GYN, and that\u2019s ok. Some women are comfortable with a male. My OB/GYN is male. I wouldn\u2019t want to be treated by anyone else. His compassion through our pregnancy loss was amazing. I have been examined by females. Worst experience that I had was with a female doctor. (Lots of \u201cthat doesn\u2019t hurt\u201d, then insisted that I couldn\u2019t possibly have a UTI but it must be an STD and the tests were wrong. A couple days later I ended up at the ER. It was a very bad UTI that had spread to my kidneys. The ER doc was livid.)", "NAH, that was rude of her, but not completely uncalled for. I personally have a male gyno, simply because I had a lot of recommendations for him and when i met him, he was super kind and helped my anxiety a lot. But not only is that not the case for most male gynecologists, the norm is more the opposite. \n\nAnd your reaction honestly tells me a bit about how you feel about women voicing their opinions. And if you're going to go into that field, you need to understand that there will be MANY women who refuse to see you simply because you're a man, and you need to accept that. Also understand that just because you would never do something abhorrent, that doesn't mean every man would do the same.", "NTA I won't ever see a male gynaecologist unless I'm dying. I personally don't get what it is that makes men want to go into it if it isn't about looking at vaginas all day but at the end of the day, they can do what they want. Not saying women are better, I have pcos and the shit I've dealt with from female gynaecologists is crazy, but at least I know that if they try to assault me I have a good chance of defending myself.", "I'm a woman, I have had male and female OBGYNs, and because of my schedule, I'll just take whoever is available in the practice plus some things can't wait. The practice I go to always asks if I would prefer a male or female doctor and they have a policy of a female nurse present when the doctor is male.\n\nTo me, you are NTA; however, I do agree with your friends that you should drop the subject. Your friend who made the comment isn't going to change her view by you trying to pursue the topic. It sounds like she made a broad generalized accusation somewhat off the cuff, and when you responded, the two of you both dug in. \n\nI do think YWBTA if you didn't look at  being a male OBGYN from the perspective of a woman, being in the stirrups is a vulnerable feeling and it's not exactly fun making small talk while you get a pap smear or the speculum isn't placed just right. So, if this is the field you wish to pursue, take a page from your own book. Try not to be narrow-minded if patients prefer to have a female doctor.", "ESH.  Only because your post sounds like you got very heated and angry, you could tell her she was wrong without going all attack mode on her. \n\nI think it is a common enough misperception that you could have just corrected her.  \n\nOne of my AFAB kids asked me this last week actually, why would a guy want to be a gynecologist.  I said lots of doctors love to deliver babies and help women be healthy, but there have been movies that demonize male gynecologists and the fact that Bill Cosby played one on tv doesn't help them out either.  \n\nJeremy Irons was in that creepy movie and I know it hit my subconscious.  Maybe it hit your friends too.", "NTA This is her hang up and ignorance, not yours Could you have let it slide?  Yes. You're human and you reacted.  She put all male ob/gyn's in the same neat little perv box when that's not the case at all.", "NTA.\nIf this was ANY other generalization, people would be grabbing their pitchforks and talking about how you can\u2019t let injustice and stereotypes stand. And if you are silent, you\u2019re complicit.\n\nWhy would this be any different? \n\nYes, there are plenty of women who are uncomfortable going to a male gynecologist. I prefer to see a female one when available. But my second favorite gynecologist was male and delivered my son. In the end, I just want quality medical care.\n\nOur office asks all its patients if they would like to have a chaperone in the room (whether the provider is female or male) for everyone\u2019s protection. The patient can decline.", "NAH bc of the number of male gynos that have been accused by multiple patients of assault.

For centuries, giving birth was a female only event. For centuries, the medical field wasn't open to women unless they were a midwife.

Then, fast forward again to the creation of the diaphragm and the pill and imagine the comments of narrow-minded male doctors. \n\nThere is a bit of distrust and gender bias built in.

Imagine holding your hand up like you are saying stop.  That is reject mode where what the person is saying to you defaults to being rejected or not heard.  Then turn your hand like it is like you are doing a chop.  In receiving mode what they are saying gets through by default and can be considered.  \n\nWhen you are trying to get information or correction into someone you have a much stronger chance if they are in receiving mode rather than rejecting mode.

Women who have easy periods sometimes have a hard time understanding that it\u2019s not that easy for everyone, and my friends have said this attitude occasionally finds its way into female providers as well.\n\nYour \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d comments were wildly inappropriate.  Even if she was coming from a place of trauma, that doesn\u2019t make it ok to stereotype an entire gender that way.", ">My friend (26f) made the comment that it's weird for men to decide to become gynecologists.

The most important thing is that you\u2019re passionate about what you do because that will be what continues to drive you. Good luck!!", "NTA, my gyno is male, & my s/o is comfortable with him. We prefer Him because he's gentle.", "NTA, doctor is a doctor no matter male or female.\nI went to both female and male obgyn, no bad experiences from both sexes. I would say that some male doctors were even more understanding amd gentle than women.\nAnd i dont know why some woman say pap and other smears hurt, its unpleasant, but it doesnt hurt.\nI even think that because men cant experience things a woman can, they are more into listening what you are experiencing and trying to explain that to you why and how etc. is smth happening. For example during pregnancy.\nFor me, i dont see male or female, i see a doctor, and all i care is he/she a good doctor.", "NTA, but I never go to male doctors for female related care. They tend to be very dismissive. The one time I went to a male one, he told me that all my period problems would be solved once I had a baby, so yeah... no, thank you.", "NTA, she's doing far too much. But personally I will never go to a male gyno again. My first ever appointment I was about 18 and the guy told me I should get a small mole on my outer labia removed for aesthetic reasons.", "NTA male gynes have a lot of prejudice to overcome but I had one for my first two kids and he gave me excellent care. I was super bummed when he moved and I had to change providers. My worst Pap smear was administered by a woman.", "I truly believe there are male OB/GYN\u2019s out there that are willing to help women and make a difference. \n\nUnfortunately, I also truly believe there are male OB/GYN\u2019s that strictly go into it for personal pleasure.", "The dude who delivered my daughter was the BEST!

While there are certainly excellent male specialists and ob/gyns and female doctors in those fields who aren\u2019t good, overall I have had better experiences with female doctors so go to them whenever possible.", "I had a male obgyn make me bleed once during an exam, and never went back.", "NTA. I personally prefer male OB/GYN doctors. They have been the most gentle and understanding. There have been times where I had to see a female doctor for certain procedures when my doctor was out. I didn't mind them and can't say that the experience was particularly bad either way. Men are professional just like the women are. At the end of the day it's a body part and that is all they see it as. \n\nAfter having kids honestly I don't care who is looking at the goods as long as you are answering my concerns and warm up your hands before you touch me... because yikes their hands are cold.", "Yeah, bc men are so turned on by swabbing cervixes, watching women shit while shoving a watermelon out of themselves, and talking to menopausal women about their lowered labido. **NTA**. I wouldn\u2019t want her as my physician, period (no pun intended). If she\u2019s narrow-minded about this, I worry about her with transgender patients or anyone who doesn\u2019t fit the mold of what she expects every day.", "I have had some great male OBYN\u2019s I have had a couple female ones I HATED so it does both ways.\nNTA", "NTA my current OBGYN is a male and the best ob I\u2019ve had. Her presumptions are her hang ups, just know that you face them in the future to. Many Women have a lot of trauma associated with men so it isn\u2019t uncommon for those to have similar feelings. I doubt it will be the last time you will hear similar accusations if you continue down this path.", "NAH! I've had a male gyno for years, ever since I was a minor who started my period and up until now, as an almost 22-year old woman. I only switched recently to a female gyno because the male doctor was reducing his availability and number of appointments + his receptionist sucked ass and I absolutely hated her for various reasons. I've only had one appointment with the new doctor and so far she seems ok but suddenly I'm getting charged for the meds I've been taking for years so now I have to figure out the cause of that!\n\nAnyways both of you have interesting points to make and while I don't outright agree with her views I understand why she would feel that way. At the same time I've heard of female gynos being really judgy and rude towards fellow female patients, and I've also heard of creepy male doctors which is why I'm mixed on this. In my personal view, anyone can choose a specific doctor for any reason, but I agree that their personal comfort is the most important one! \n\nJust take this experience into account when you graduate and finally enter the medical world as an actual doctor or nurse. Also keep in mind that there are many stories of women being dismissed of their health concerns by doctors. So when you do receive female patients it's important to take all of that into consideration while treating them! Good luck in med school u/Commercial-Money420!", "NTA during a routine smear a problem was detected and I had to have further procedures and treatments. They were all women. Some were reassuring and gentle, some were rather cold and rather rough. I had a tumour removed on the cervix. Then I had to go again for a biopsy for womb cancer and I had to have a guy. I was rather nervous, but my goodness he spent a long while going through stuff with me first, really listening to me and was very gentle and reassuring. He then went through my options afterwards. I ended up having a negative result for cancer but he just didn't like it based on everything he had seen and what I had said of symptoms etc and decided to do some further testing with his team and have a camera. It was endo. They were a team of women and they were impatient and rather harsh and I ended up fainting from the pain. So all in all if I had to pick just one of the people I had seen it was the guy for his professional, compassionate manner. My second choice was a very gentle female doctor with tiny hands lol. I do not think we should be judging people on their gender, but on their professionalism, empathy and skills.", "NTA Your friend is. A man is not a pervert because of his chosen profession.", "I prefer to see a male gyno to a female. Pretty sure none of my friends are like that but it\u2019s what works for me.  NTA. You keep doing what you\u2019re doing and good luck in whatever specialty you choose for your career.", "NTA, what does she say about female urologists?", "First, NTA .\n\nI seem to have had bad experiences with female gynecologists. The first slut shamed me for asking for birth control and violated my privacy by bringing my mother in to the exam room after my request. I was 19. I didn\u2019t need mom\u2019s permission. I was pissed; heck mom was pissed. \n\nNext female gynecologist was super dismissive of concerns I had over an abnormal pap. \n\nThe third female gynecologist invited a bunch of residents into my exam without warning or asking me first. \n\nNever had anything close to those experiences with male gynecologists. The ones I saw were kind, not judgmental and made me feel comfortable.\n\nI\u2019d say everyone is going to have a variety of experiences. Also, there are plenty of female proctologists out there. I don\u2019t think they got into that specialty to look at male bits all day. Your classmate is a real jerk for making assumptions about why someone would choose a specialty. Best of luck to you.", "I had a male gyno AND a male midwife. They were great. My second baby was the first baby the midwife delivered and when I was back for my third, I specifically asked for him. He ended up coming in on his day off when my bub decided to arrive 6 weeks early.", "NTA  i've had both male and femal obys.. and to be honest i felt more comfortable with the male dr.  It felt that they were more gentle than the women.  Just my opinion", "NTA. Did she even stop to consider that not everyone who needs a gyno is a woman?\n\nPeople can have their own preferences about the gender of their reproductive care practitioners, but they should respect that other people have different and often opposing desires and access needs, and not perpetuate nonsense that might harm those other people.", "I've had loads of reproductive issues and the kindest of all of my ob-gyns have been men. The only ones to listen to me and help me have been men.\n\n\nThe ones who made me cry and tried to convince me that I was exaggerating my problems or the ones who called me a liar to my face because they had never seen my exact problem before? All women.\n\n\nIt's 2023.", "NTA, I don't personally see male OBGYNs due to sexual trauma in my past. However, when I had my son and the OB on call was a man. I didn't think he was there just to stare on my parts. He came rushing in as soon as he heard I had complications while my regular OB who was also on shift and available (as she was supposed to be handling said birth) didn't come at all, and I will forever be thankful for his quick actions which I know is something all doctors or nurses do. But still. Male OBs are just as trust worthy as female OBs", "NTA. \n\nSome of women may prefer a female gynaecologist. But everyone has their own preferences and comfort levels. \n\nI have had nothing but great experiences with male doctors on this front and my IVF baby was a result of such.

He\u2019s the only doctor I\u2019ve seen who made an effort to figure out why I was in pain all the time and didn\u2019t invalidate my feelings and say my pain was at all less than it was. He\u2019s wonderful. Don\u2019t let anyone put you down about going into a speciality that helps women. And be more like my gynecologist because seriously we need people to pay attention to us. Good luck figuring out what your speciality will be!", "NTA\nYou don't need to have cancer to treat leukemia. You don't need to have kids to be a pediatrician. You don't need a to be a woman w/ a vagina and reproductive capabilities to delivery babies and treat ovarian cysts. These are skill based professions that people literally give up years of their lives to learn. The empathy that comes from being on the other end of the speculum helps sometimes, but you can learn how to be a kind, sympathetic physician without having gone through those specific experiences.\n\nThat all being said, I don't know if your colleague has undergone personal trauma underpinning this opinion (I'm thinking like Larry Nasser type shit). And there are vulnerable communities and populations in the US that have been disproportionately affected by doctors being abusive shits. And there are groups that have more stringent expectations of separation between the sexes (had a colleague from conservative Jewish background who opted out of the practical male genital exam session in med school bc she was going into a field that did not need those skills).", "NTA, you are correct, your friend is very narrow minded. You should definitely pursue OBGYN as a career if it interests you! My male OBGYN is amazing!

A friend recommended this old man who thanks to years of experience managed to diagnose the issue after a single consult and one set of tests. He delivered a healthy baby and I realized that putting aside my discomfort to see him changed the entire course of my life.", "NTA I've had both male and female OBGYNs. I care what the doctor's like not what gender they are. With my youngest son I also had a male midwife and he was great.", "I thought that too at first and when I was pregnant. But when I was giving birth and had a male OB deliver my son I definitely appreciate him and he was great and one of the best OBGYNs I had during that whole experience!", "I'll see male obgyns. I don't really care. I've had multiple kids, multiple pregnancies, and have had no difference in care between males and females. They're just doctors. I'll see whoever, I don't think gender has ever really come into play with me for choosing a doctor.\n\nNot like you really get to choose anyways- my first obgyn was a female, and then when it came time to deliver, the doctor on call was a male. You don't really get to choose the doctor that delivers your baby, you're stuck with whoever is covering. With my last baby, the entire freakin' team was in Covid quarantine so not only did I get a male doctor, it was a male doctor I'd never met before, from a different practice, who was covering.", "I hear you, although when I was in college, I had a female roommate who said she would never see a female gynecologist, because she thought it would make her a lesbian. Yes, she was very homophobic. I thought that was so weird. I never heard that kind of reasoning before.", "Same here. I wouldn\u2019t want a male OBGYN either. I\u2019m more comfortable with a woman.", "yeah if other women want to see male gynos that\u2019s great but ill only see a woman. men have a tendency to dismiss women\u2019s legitimate concerns, and my vagina is something i take seriously", "I\u2019ve had both over the years, and it has been fine. I do prefer my current female one, but she\u2019s also my PCP, so it\u2019s nice to just have one person who can handle most everything, and I just really like her in general. Sadly she\u2019s cutting back her practice and probably going to retire in the next few years.", "Same. NTA but I also would not see one.", "I\u2019m the same way. My former roommate (a man) thought I was an AH for not wanting a man as my gyno. It\u2019s a personal preference I suppose. My sister ONLY wanted a man gyno, which is her prerogative.", "Same. OP, you're NTA but honestly, I would think carefully about this specialty for this different reason. I don't object to men becoming gynecologists on principle (and if anything I think the specialty probably reduces interest in women's genitalia, rather than sexually excites them; I mean, you'd spend all your time seeing medical problems and birth-ripping in that area, haha), but I would never willingly see a male OBGYN, and I would be unhappy if I was forced to. (Forced due to, say, lack of female OBGYNs available, I guess if maybe fewer were successful in competing for limited spots against male OBGYNs). \n\nSeeing an OBGYN is a very private and intimidating experience and I would expect that the majority of women would prefer to see a female OBGYN, just as a reflex. And for that reason, for your own sake, I'd be concerned about it being a potentially risky career prospect, if your patient population is largely composed of people who *would* see someone else if they could, and may even be predisposed to suspicions like your friend's, which could put you at greater risk of more frequent accusations of inappropriate behaviour over misunderstandings.\n\nBut like ultimately, if you become an OBGYN, I hope you're a great one! Best wishes on your career and life journey :)", "It's funny because one of the nicest, most comforting gynecologist I've ever had was male.

Doesn't mean a male OBGYN is a creep or weirdo, and i never want to assume that about someone, but i still won't see one.

Many of us women comfortably see male OBGYNs - many of us even prefer it. \n\nPlease do not dissuade intelligent and thoughtful potential doctors from the specialty - we want the best and brightest to always see women\u2019s health as a career option, regardless of their gender.", "To be honest though, even if she had a deeply traumatic experience she shouldn't be making such an absurd blanket statement. She doubled down on her position and tried to defend it as a universal truth, which is even more ridiculous. You're so NTA here. \n\nLike, what if a trans man wanted to become a gynecologist? Would she argue he isn't allowed to do that despite his own personal familiarity with the reproductive system OBGYNs care for, or would that somehow \"not count\" for her because she's assuming this rigid gender/sex construct? How about an AMAB person who identities as non binary, and not as male? Hell, even thinking about myself as a cisgender bi woman or for a cis lesbian woman - would she think that we're only there to look at vaginas all day because we're attracted to women? And what about a gay man who has zero interest in women?\n\nYou were right to call her narrow minded. There's so many assumptions about gender, biological sex, and sexual orientation in her point of view. If she actually wants to be a good provider, she needs to unpack some of these biases.", "This was my first thought. Unless they're gynecologists to the stars they're getting a bunch of random vaginas and then infections or problems. \n\nI also feel any person obsessed with vaginas enough to perv there way into a profession would get weeded out along the way.", "The worst exam I ever received was from a female doctor. She was extremely rough and told me that what she was doing shouldn't hurt. I was in the ER due to extreme bleeding and anemia. They were doing a pelvic to make sure I wasn't having a miscarriage. It has been 2 decades, and I can still remember her looking up at me with disgust about being in pain. That said, I have had some really good and bad exams since. My hysterectomy was done by a male Dr, and I had the best recovery. He even drained a hematoma off my side in the most gentle and reassuring manner. \n\nI don't think about gender of my doctors. I focus on the relationship and how they listen to me. I have a very high pain tolerance, so explaining to people that just because I am calmly sitting here talking to you doesn't mean I am not in the worst pain. I still remember going to the ER for abdominal pain. They didn't believe I was in pain and let me walk into the CT scan room. I was talking with the tech and suddenly she got super quiet. They then called immediately for a wheelchair and refused to let me get up. She found that my appendix was perforated and about to explode. I was in surgery within 45 mins. Always go to people who listen. I was almost discharged that day and I insisted on some form of imaging to determine what was wrong.", "I refuse to see a female OBGYN. The first one I saw was rough and made me avoid PAP smears for two years. Another was so rude and dismissive, I almost bled to death. Everything was \" oh it can't hurt that bad \" And \" all of us hurt after delivery\" . I ended up bleeding so much that blood was coming out of my incision, ending with needing blood transfusion and emergency surgery.", "She is. He wasn't very nice about it, and kept explaining to me it was normal. So don't do that. \n\nBut I personally don't think he was indicative of male obgyns. I've heard of lots of good ones.", "I read that and it sickened me.

I will bring clean socks, though, I stand on my feet all day, and while the doc wears a mask, I feel it is only polite to make sure my feet aren't stinky.", "Hah. That\u2019s fair. I wouldn\u2019t want to go in smelly either.", "I agree. I think male or female can be great or awful. With a male their can be issues because they can\u2019t experience the conditions or care that\u2019s required. With a female there\u2019s a chance that since she has experienced some of those things she might allow that to cause bias towards what her patients are experiencing. (I\u2019ve had several children. One was a textbook delivery that, as far as childbirth goes, was not bad at all. One, holy back labor Batman!)", "I\u2019ve been seeing the same male gyno for 30 years.  He\u2019s considered one of the best in our area and never once not listened to me. I\u2019ll be quite upset if he decides to retire.", "Right??? I swear some of them were being as horrible as possible. \n\nFrom accusing me of lying about my home pregnancy test being positive, then trying to insist I had to be miscarrying before blood work came back. \n\nTo making me bleed with a speculum. Multiple times saying \"I've done this too, it's not that bad\" \n\nTo not informing me of the state of my unborn child health as the reason they needed to \"pause\" labor while I was being induced. Waiting overnight to explain wtf was going on. \n\nTo not prescribing me correct medication for my conditions. Not explaining that the correct medications could make me more fertile. \n\nTo unannounced rectal exams. (OH I didn't think you'd notice) \n\nAnd tell me that I couldn't possibly feel the endometrial biopsy. \n\nI've had male doctors use warmed lube, and warm the speculum under water. Give my body a chance to adjust before opening. Pay attention when I tense. \n\nOrder me a shower when I was on bedrest in the hospital. Which his female partner had denied. I had been there a week. Sponge baths in bed when you are fully capable of caring for yourself are mortifying. And my head itched. \n\nHe treated me with human dignity that was sorely lacking in my woman physicians. \n\nFor me, it's also easier to advocate for myself with a man. I know he has no personal experience, so does he. \nSo I am more confident describing what I am going through."]}
