Little to no stink, but a lot of work outside in all sorts of weather, with long hours.  But you get to see, firsthand, some pretty cool stuff.\n\nWorking with humane societies, wild animal rescue/rehabilitation.  Low pay but working with animals all the time.\n\nYou can go into an adjacent field like animal/wildlife education.  Educator or docent at a zoo or museum.\n\nStart talking to your professors about different types of zoological jobs.\n\nAlso, if you're in the US, go to usajobs.gov and start snooping around.  Go crazy with job search terms.  See just what kind of jobs the gov't has.
