The sea birds are bottom of the barrel and are far from considered anything out of the ordinary.\n\nWorking with house pets (even super exotic ones) is simply not the same thing.", "Yeah, it's not for you.    Some people have more sensitivity to it and can't cope with the strong stenches.  \n\nEveryone has their strong qualities.  Find out what your strengths are and follow that course.   Being vomited on by pelicans isn't for everyone.", "You\u2019re naive. What you described is tame compared to my 3 years doing wildlife rehab. You need separate clothes for work, that are washed hot and with bleach. You need to understand you will get gross. There will be smells that linger. Any animal that eats fish is going to stink. Any animal that eats meat is going to have disgusting feces. Tons of birds projectile vomit as a defense mechanism. Big cats spray, pinnipeds are oily, scared animals bite.", "You are indeed too naive. Switch fields.", "I would say NTA for quitting this volunteer job if you realized that you didn\u2019t want to work with animals. But learn from your experiences! Either suck it up and learn to cope or change your plans and become like a zoo administrator who doesn\u2019t deal with animals hands on. Clearly you\u2019re not cut out for that", "Dog/cat/cow/horse does not prepare you at all.\n\nWorst thing I ever smelt was a leftover mackerel at the bottom of a loggerhead sea turtle tank.\n\nI retrieved it from the tank, and as soon as it left the water its flesh promptly fell off of its bones and hit the floor with a plop. Absolutely indescribable bad smell, I promptly vomited. (I then cleaned everything up because it was my job and my vomit haha)\n\nOther disgusting things you may have to deal with in zoos are things such as examining stomach contents/poop for dietary information or even sometimes you need to unprolapse an animal! \n\nPlus even with experience with horses etc, animals poop. Lots and lots of poop. Not all of it is solid. Penguin poop isn't great to deal with especially when fresh/wet. Or if a penguin is standing 2ft behind you and projectile poops onto your pants.\n\n\n\nAnd I am gonna say OP gentle YTA, simply because you are in college and should know that zoology typically involves a lot of body fluids, and many bird species vomit as a defence mechanism. You should have at least tried to stick it out the day and then withdrawn. It's a valuable training and learning experience that someone missed out on.", "There are occasional posts on Reddit about restaurants and bars near zoos having to implement policies about zookeepers because the smell is still unbearable even after showers and changing clothes lol.", "Yeah I don\u2019t think any farm animal can prepare you for the natural stink of some animals. There\u2019s a cave in Oregon you can go down to see the sea lions and every time we go there people are puking because the smell is so bad! If you have a sensitive stomach are prone to puking zoo life might not be for you, you gotta take care of some really gross stuff.", "The worst dog doesn\u2019t begin to compare to the cleanest opossum. Wild animal smells are absolutely foul, and most zookeepers always smell of it. You can get a preview by volunteering at your local wildlife rehab center. \n\nKeep in mind that food prep for wildlife involves cutting up dead rodents, birds, occasional live-feeding, and handling it when it comes out the other end too. You will get gross. You will smell bad. You need to get past that to be a zookeeper.", "It\u2019s all fish. That would be very odiferous.", "Whelp- a bird that mostly eats and regurgitates fish is gonna smell like fermenting fish. It\u2019s pretty nasty.", "There are some weird chicks somewhere in aus or nz that puke noxious sludge that can kill predators as a defense... Animals can be gross af. Use skunks as your starting point on the grossness scale.", "Be prepared to lose your social life, from what I've heard. Between the hours, and the smell that never goes away, you'll likely only really socialize with other zookeepers. Domestic animals don't hold a candle to wild animals.", "Dogs cats cows and horses are probably like the cleanest animals. I\u2019ve heard some real horror stories about zoo stinks. I would definitely look more into this before making any big life decisions", "She should stick to horses they can\u2019t vomit.", "Yes, it can definitely be THAT stinky, and even more.", "You will never be able to date someone who isn't a zoo keeper.", "In the job description it even says that \"a keen sense of sight, hearing,", "Generally no. It sounds gross but zookeepers are expected to get to know the smells of their animals. Funny-smelling feces can be an early sign that an animal is sick or has a parasite, so no, we don't allow keepers to tune out smells because they make them uncomfortable, you're supposed to face them head-on.\n\nIn the job description it even says that \"a keen sense of sight, hearing, and **smell**\" are all job requirements.", "Now you have to tell us what the first is. Maybe a top 3 or top 5 list!\n\nI actually haven't worked with pelicans yet. I imagine it's fishy, but is there something else that makes it worse than other animals' puke?", "> I do think he should have finished the job regardless\n\nYou do understand that some people are simply not capable of 'rising above' something like this, right? Doesnt make them assholes. If the person went back and did it again, then sure, asshole, but not on first exposure.", "Funny thing is that the first animal to hump me was a rabbit. I called him Humper.\ud83d\ude09", "That\u2019s probably a good day working with animals if you only get puked on once", "This is why I love animals... From afar. Like on TV.", "I first had an inkling that I might be destined to work with kids and animals when I smelled a half rotted mouse in an empty beer bottle. My coworker immediately vomited, but I didn't have much reaction - and I have a good nose. I could smell it, and it was *BAD,* but I don't tend to have a physical reaction to bad smells.", "And if you know how bad cat shit in a litter box can get, wait till it's big cat shit that you're cleaning up.", "Yeah, I can't say that dog/cat/horse poop prepared me for my first summer doing fieldwork with shorebirds. It's quite a different experience from being around unpleasant smells to having whole colonies of pissed offed birds try to smack and shit on your head. I toughened up real quick as I didn't want to publicly wuss out in front of the really cool people I was working with. Luckily I was only barfed on once by a laughing gull chick we banded (we were mostly banding common terns, who didn't seem inclined to barf on us), which was significantly more unpleasant than fishy tern shit.", "And zookeepers saying that it\u2019s essentially impossible to date someone in another field because of the smell", "I remember that post!", "I dunno even wildlife sanctuaries are pretty tame, at least the one I volunteered at was.  It was mostly just birds.  Yea the cages were gross but it wasn't that bad", "Shout out for the use of odiferous! Gotta be one of my fave funkiness descriptors for sure.", "Another Australian animal that can kill!", "I honestly think horses smell good..  their poo is earthy", "Bad bot!
