You got thrown up on by a pelican, I would leave too.", "YTA, animals pee, poo and puke when they are stressed. You are studying zoology and can\u2019t handle a day of mess? You might be in the wrong field. You also took that spot from someone else if you were one of only 2 chosen for the program. Someone else who would have actually participated. Your professor has every right to be mad at you. \n\nAs an intern you\u2019re usually responsible for the crap jobs, literally shoveling crap. Wild animals get stressed when handled, especially birds. Other animals may scratch, claw or bite you, but that\u2019s kinda the deal when working with creatures that don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re doing to them. \n\nAlso, when a job is described as messy, have the forethought to bring a change of clothes.", "YTA. Working with animals is messy. You committed to this job and then bailed. That's unprofessional, even though I do understand that certain smells are overwhelming. \n\nI think you would do well to examine your next opportunities better before volunteering. You should've asked more questions about what the 'mess' really entailed. That way you could've made a better judgement on whether this was the job for you.", "YTA and yea you will suck in zoology. You may wanna find a new field.", "YTA. You made their day exponentially harder and more work because you decided you didn\u2019t feel like it anymore.   Grow up.", "YTA\n\n...and probably in the wrong field. Maybe switch to palaeontology - no puking when they're fossilised.", "YTA, how did you imagine working with animals would be? News flash, it's messy and smelly.\n\nI would consider a career change.", "I would have understood if you actually left (that still wouldn't have been ok, but more understandable). But you stayed there - just didn't do the work you signed up for. They were counting on you and you ... just sat there. in your puke soaked shirt.\n\nApologize to your prof.

And you're studying Zoology?  You should have planned ahead and gotten a rubber apron.  Basically you bailed on them without really trying.  Throwing up is not the end of the world. You just didn't want to do it. YTA", "YTA.\n\nLook, this field is known for being one full of insanely strong-stomached people. Some are sort of that way naturally. Many of us were insane enough to like animals enough to condition ourselves into it and go through olfactory hell to make 12 dollars an hour.\n\nI'm one of them.\n\nNot gonna lie, my first week working with big cats was unbearable. I think I threw up 3 times my first day. I felt like the overwhelming cat piss rotten meat rancid shit stench was a inescapable cloud that haunted me even after work each day.\n\nWasn't given any breaks or much consolation. After a week the nausea died down a bit, and eventually altogether.\n\nI still notice the stink and it grosses me out on bad days, but eventually you build up an immunity. You **have** to be willing to through the acclimation to get into these jobs.", "So you just sat there on your phone waiting for them to finish the work you agreed to do and then have the nerve to complain about the smell on the ride back when they're suffering from the exact same thing?

If you are going to work with animals, you get bit, scratched, puked and shit on. That is how it works. You work with animals who want to kill or kick the shit out of you for doing ouchy or scary things to them that may be saving their lives. And you work on teams that require you to work together at the ANIMAL\u2019S pace and comfort level- not yours. My partner was kicked in the face by a dog and lost a tooth. She was bit by a cat and the ensuing infection sent her to the ER. That is just how it is. And those are the domestic ones who are used to being handled. \n\nYTA- change your attitude or change your major. Your choice.", "YTA. Zoology may not be the best degree for you.", "YTA.   You volunteered for a specific project where the other 2 were relying on you to help.  You abandoned them forcing them to do your share of the work while you sat around pouting.   Working with animals inherently involves bodily functions.", "YTA. Birds are messy creatures. Animals are messy creatures.  You may not be cut out for a career in zoology, which I gurantee will involve working with creatures who will vomit, bleed, and make messes on a daily basis.", "YTA. Zoology is covered in animal bodily fluids and smelly. Find a new career path, you picked wrong. You owe apologies to the professor, your fellow volunteer and the organization. You took a spot others wanted and made work harder for others.", "ESH. \n\nYou have the right to leave a field that you don\u2019t feel comfortable working in, and yes, you need to be comfortable with animal waste and fluids whilst working in Zoology. \n\nYou suck because you left everyone else there to pick up the slack because you didn\u2019t research what you were getting into. I\u2019d advise you look into a different area of expertise.", "YTA\n\nYou were there being stinky all day anyway but instead of being useful, you messed around on your phone. The whole point of field work is to show you what doing the job in the real world would look like. Sounds like you've found out that you are studying the wrong field and need to adjust your sails.", ">  I'm not sure what I was supposed to do\n\nYou were supposed to suck it up, Buttercup.  IE, you were supposed to help the others.\n\n> I would have gotten sick myself if I kept at it.\n\nSo you puke once or twice, you get used to it, and you move on.  God help your kids if you ever become a parent.\n\nYTA (and you need to toughen the fuck up)", "YTA and possibly in the wrong academic field. Your professor could've been more explicit with the warning but if you plan to work with animals, you have to expect that it's going to be messy and you'll deal with gross bodily fluids. Were there any other tasks you could've done to help out instead of sulking on your phone the rest of the time?", "YTA sitting on the sidelines didn\u2019t make you stink any less. There was no reason for you not to continue doing the job you volunteered for.", "Uggh as a long-time zookeeper/manager this brings me back to the **annoyances** we deal with with the interns every summer...\n\n\"No, no you can't take a 30 minute break and shower because you slipped in bear poop, just hose it and keep going...yes, I know you stink, I promise you none of us mind...\"\n\n\"Yes, yes you do have to clean that mess up...yes I know it's all oily and you can smell the fish in it, that is how an otter works.\"\n\nWe used to show a bit more patience but with how saturated the field is and how many newcomers want a shot at it, our policy now has basically become that if someone complains about something being gross, give them the most horridly vile tasks imaginable each day until they get over it or quit.

YTA and an embarrassment to your professor.", "YTA, is this real? You know that animals are messy? You are such an AH, unbelievable.", "YTA.

If you retch over things like this, maybe this isn't the field for you.", "I won\u2019t say yta like others but I do think a reevaluation of career choice might be necessary.

You can decide at any point that you no longer wish to continue volunteering. Second, the Professor didn\u2019t adequately explain the job and risks that came with it.

Or how little patience they have for the \"it's too gross for me\" stuff?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. How are you a zoology major that can't handle animals or their body fluids? That's like somebody that faints at the sight of blood trying to be a surgeon. You're more than old enough to know that zoology isn't just all fuzzy cuddles all the time. Hell anybody that's been to a zoo, like, ever, knows how dirty and gross wild animals can be. Monkeys fling poop, elephants drop a deuce like ain't no thang wherever they please... And you thought that banding pelicans was going to be some sunshine-y walk in the park like your own little Disney Princess moment?\n\nYou should seriously reconsider your major bc if you can't handle a day of pelican puke you're not gonna cut it in the field.", "YTA. Based on the professional's \"We said it would be messy work\" remark - and the fact that you study zoology and presumably have some knowledge of animal functions - you should have known this was a strong possibility. You should have stuck in through, especially considering you were on an island and couldn't leave anyway.", "Lol. \n\nMaybe there's a Zoo Theory alternative. /s", "Maybe I'm naive but I highly doubt day-to-day zoo work could be as foul as getting fish-puke vomited on you all day...\n\nI've volunteered with animals before and been fine, this was just too much.", "ikr?
