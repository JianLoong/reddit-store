We live in university-style apartments where you\u2019re assigned roommates based on compatibility, so I didn\u2019t know Anne before she moved in late January while I was gone on a vacation. We\u2019ve been living together 6 months now and she\u2019s a decent person and relatively pleasant roommate most of the time. With that being said, we\u2019re friendly, but we\u2019re not friends. I\u2019ve got no issue with her and I don\u2019t think she any issue with me, we\u2019re just both always gone from the apartment when the other is here (she\u2019s a student + part time worker, I\u2019m a full time worker) and we don\u2019t have much of anything in common. We try to say we\u2019ll hang out and do this or that, but nothing ever materializes. I know this is a bit ramble-y but it will become relevant.\n\nA couple months ago, Anne\u2019s bf Jon (20M) was feeling poorly. I don\u2019t know exactly what happened, but she took him to the ER and he racked up a couple grand in medical bills. My understanding of the situation is that it wasn\u2019t life threatening, but he needed some treatment and medication. Being a student, Jon couldn\u2019t afford to pay the bills and my roommate has set up a GoFundMe for him. She told me about it, shared it with me, and I shared it on my social media pages to help spread the word for her and potentially get her some more donors. \n\nApparently, that wasn\u2019t good enough. Anne came up to me a couple days ago talking about her and Jon doing something and led it into the subject of his ER visit and med bills. She told me she noticed that my name wasn\u2019t among the donors to his GFM and said if I was saving up for a bigger donation that it would be better to just split it up and donate part now because Jon is trying to make a payment before the end of the month. It got really awkward and I told her I wasn\u2019t saving to donate because I\u2019m trying to put all my funds together in preparation for moving across the country next week. I need money for the trip and to tide me over until I secure work. \n\nAnne got pissed to say the least. She said I was selfish and had no empathy if I wouldn\u2019t even donate twenty bucks to her bf\u2019s debt. She said if I could afford to pay my last three month\u2019s rent at once, I could afford to spare some money for his bills that he can\u2019t afford and that he\u2019s poorer than me right now so I **need** to help him. Honestly, I like helping people when I\u2019m in the position to, but I\u2019m not. On top of that, I only somewhat know Anne and **barely** know Jon, and half of what I\u2019ve heard about him frankly isn\u2019t good. Including how Anne has been contemplating for a month or so about dumping him. \n\nI have no clue if I\u2019m being an ass or not. Am I?\n\nEdit: some people have brought up college-mandated health insurance requirements. I have never in my life heard of this until today. I don\u2019t know what university Anne\u2019s bf attends, so I don\u2019t know they policy, but the university Anne and I attend does not require students to have health insurance and the student health center does not turn away any student that doesn\u2019t have insurance.

So, considering those two things, you have to be okay saying no to some genuine cases of need even if you are a generous person.

A clinic will check for mundane issues, can still prescribe meds, and will triage patients to the hospital if it's deemed serious enough.  My 19 year old was sick last semester and lived next to the on campus hospital.  I explained the way ERs charge and they took an Uber to a clinic, saw a doctor within 30 minutes of arrival (far less than the wait time at many ERs), got tested in office, got treatment in the office, got a prescription called in to the pharmacy, and took an Uber back to campus for less than $200 (turns out they had an odd bacterial infection).  The ER would have been $2k+ and would have taken far longer (waiting for tests which the clinic sent out for 2 day turn around since the doctor didn't feel it was an emergency).\n\nWe don't know the nature of Jon's illness, but it's possible he unintentionally ran up his costs by going to the emergency room when a clinic would have been a more appropriate choice for his symptoms.
