We live in university-style apartments where you\u2019re assigned roommates based on compatibility, so I didn\u2019t know Anne before she moved in late January while I was gone on a vacation. We\u2019ve been living together 6 months now and she\u2019s a decent person and relatively pleasant roommate most of the time. With that being said, we\u2019re friendly, but we\u2019re not friends. I\u2019ve got no issue with her and I don\u2019t think she any issue with me, we\u2019re just both always gone from the apartment when the other is here (she\u2019s a student + part time worker, I\u2019m a full time worker) and we don\u2019t have much of anything in common. We try to say we\u2019ll hang out and do this or that, but nothing ever materializes. I know this is a bit ramble-y but it will become relevant.\n\nA couple months ago, Anne\u2019s bf Jon (20M) was feeling poorly. I don\u2019t know exactly what happened, but she took him to the ER and he racked up a couple grand in medical bills. My understanding of the situation is that it wasn\u2019t life threatening, but he needed some treatment and medication. Being a student, Jon couldn\u2019t afford to pay the bills and my roommate has set up a GoFundMe for him. She told me about it, shared it with me, and I shared it on my social media pages to help spread the word for her and potentially get her some more donors. \n\nApparently, that wasn\u2019t good enough. Anne came up to me a couple days ago talking about her and Jon doing something and led it into the subject of his ER visit and med bills. She told me she noticed that my name wasn\u2019t among the donors to his GFM and said if I was saving up for a bigger donation that it would be better to just split it up and donate part now because Jon is trying to make a payment before the end of the month. It got really awkward and I told her I wasn\u2019t saving to donate because I\u2019m trying to put all my funds together in preparation for moving across the country next week. I need money for the trip and to tide me over until I secure work. \n\nAnne got pissed to say the least. She said I was selfish and had no empathy if I wouldn\u2019t even donate twenty bucks to her bf\u2019s debt. She said if I could afford to pay my last three month\u2019s rent at once, I could afford to spare some money for his bills that he can\u2019t afford and that he\u2019s poorer than me right now so I **need** to help him. Honestly, I like helping people when I\u2019m in the position to, but I\u2019m not. On top of that, I only somewhat know Anne and **barely** know Jon, and half of what I\u2019ve heard about him frankly isn\u2019t good. Including how Anne has been contemplating for a month or so about dumping him. \n\nI have no clue if I\u2019m being an ass or not.

Most of his debt would probably be waived anyway.", "What did I just read? That is some grade A entitlement, my friend. NTA in any way, shape or form. It was lovely of you to share the page! Tell Anne to stuff it, lol.", "NTA\n\nAmerica's healthcare system is the asshole. What kind of country puts a 20-something in debt over making sure he wasn't dying.\n\nBarbaric.", "NTA\n\nYou're not required to pay for an unknown stranger's debt. It's a shame how expensive United States Healthcare is, but that's also not your fault. Your roommate is an AH for trying to manipulate you into giving her boyfriend money.", "NTA, her boyfriend has other options if he\u2019s low income and it\u2019s weird for her to place responsibility on you. If you don\u2019t have the means to, you don\u2019t have the means to. And if you\u2019re moving you won\u2019t have to deal with her for long.", "NTA - Spoiler alert, the money isn't for medical bills.", "NTA. I live in a country with free healthcare so I can't be sure, but I'd assume that it's understood that your healthcare is your responsibility and at most your family's if you really need the help. The idea of a Gofundme for a medical bill already sounds a bit sleazy to me. Urging you to donate is a whole level beyond.", "NTA. \n\nYou are not in any way obligated to pay for expenses incurred by other people let alone near strangers. It is lovely if you have the extra money to allow you to do so but as a student, i recall that being far from the case. I think you doing what you could in sharing the post and encouraging others to donate was already doing something above what you are obligated to do. \n\nIt sounds like you did what you could and that your \"compatible\" roommate is being greedy and not very understanding. Guilting you into donating is bully behavior and super toxic to any friendship you hoped to maintain after you moved apart. \n\nI wish you good luck in your upcoming move and wish you minimal to no toxicity in your life at your new place. \n\nPS for those unaware Go fund Me takes about 3% of all donations to cover operating costs so the fund raisers don't even get all of the money donated. If you were in a position to donate, i certainly wouldn't do it through go fund me.", "NTA - Donating to his GFM would be a nice gesture, sure, but it's not an obligation, and you're by no means TA if you don't. Your financial health and well-being has to come before his.", "NTA.  It is not your responsibility to pay the bills of someone you barely know.  You have already done more than enough by sharing the go fund me with other people.  For your roommate to demand a donation just makes her seem really entitled.", "NTA -- and in the US, every college I know requires students to have health insurance, so I wonder if all the bills were really medical.   SHE is TA", "NTA. It was nice enough for you to share the GFM on your social media, potentially getting them more donations.", "Nta.  She is. You have no obligation to help pay for his medical bills even if you were rich. Shut her down if she brings it up again.", "NTA.  You\u2019re not obligated to donate money towards ANYTHING.", "NTA donation is voluntary you are not required to help, if he needs help there are government and private ways he can get help it is not up to you.", "NTA and a bare acquaintance is not entitled to your money. It's none of her business what to our financial status is, and situation reversed she wouldn't be helping you with a dime.", "NTA if it\u2019s that important to her, she can go from only working part time to full time. I and others have had to do this to keep afloat during university.", "NTA. Moving across the country is expensive, and since you don't have a job lined up yet, you can't be sure how much money you'll need to cover the time until your next paycheck. Plus, he's not someone that close to you, and she's not a friend. Once you move out, you'll probably never interact with them again.", "NTA.\n\nI have lived in a couple neighborhoods where there were truly struggling homeless people and had to wrestle with this kind of thing. The reality is, there will always be more people in genuine need than you could give to and even if you did want to be maximally charitable, there is always the debate of \"do I give $20 now or use that $20 to become more stable myself so I could give $40 later when I'm doing better\". So, considering those two things, you have to be okay saying no to some genuine cases of need even if you are a generous person. It's not just the story on the other end that determines if you can say yes.\n\nEven if you entertain her line of thought that you have such an abundance of money that you should be helping others, he'd hardly come at the top of that list. A guy who might miss rent because of debt is still a far way away from people who are literally a night away from starving to death or who need resource to escape an actively violent situation. He's in a bad situation, but it's not clear it's as urgent as others you could be helping.\n\nDid Anne give all of her past paychecks to food banks and homeless shelters or did her interest in the needy only appear when the needy person was her own BF? Since it's the latter, it sounds like she herself believes it's okay for her to be selfish in the face of people in need, so she should extend you that same ability to have ownership of your own money and how it's used.", "NTA - but a wider point here, how in the world have we reached a point where in the richest society in the world, a 20 year old student has to essentially beg for strangers to donate to pay his medical bills for what sounds like a relatively innocuous illness?

Didn't have money to afford health insurance (lost everything including house in business deal gone bad) and had to be admitted for blood clots.
