I (17M) have been raised by my dad (40 M) and step mom (41 F) most of my life while bio mom (40 F) has been in jail the last twelve years or so. She started trying really hard to get in contact and be in my life through letters, family delivering messages etc. the last couple of years and I\u2019m not having it honestly.  \n\nIdk fully what she\u2019s in jail for - I know it involved domestic stuff with me and my dad and she lost all rights after going to jail.  And wasn\u2019t even allowed visits for the first few years she was in.  After that when dad offered she wouldn\u2019t except it because my dad wouldn\u2019t let me go without him or my step mom.  \n\nI will say 100% I understand why she wouldn\u2019t have wanted to see my step mom.  The briefest way I can describe it is she\u2019s was an addict for years before I was born, and dad met my step mom at a loved ones of addicts support group.  She got forced to go to rehab for a couple months and the group including my step mom (who he admits he\u2019d started messing around with) convinced him to separate because she was toxic.  \n\nTurns out she found out she was pregnant while in rehab so he broke it off with eventual step mom and tried to make it work for a few more years.  It didn\u2019t work, he came clean to mom about the old affair eventually, and well all I know is things got really bad before she started relapsing again and went to jail.  Dad filed for divorce and reconnected with eventual step mom and they gave it another go now that he was single.  \n\nI love my step mom, she\u2019s the only mom I remember.  The only member of my moms family to ever help me in anyway is my aunt who cut the rest of them including my mom off years ago.  Hearing them complain about how she ruined my bio moms life and is the reason she relapsed was getting annoying.  Finally I wrote a message to them and told them to pass it to my bio mom.  The blunt truth is - I don\u2019t know her and she\u2019s nothing to me.  She didn\u2019t raise me or bother agreeing to visits for ten years.  I told them that and to stop thinking they could change my mind and stop contacting me.  Let me tell you they blew tf up after that.  It\u2019s been everyday getting messages and phone calls.  I know she\u2019s getting out soon so they were probably hoping to reconnect after that.  \n\nI do feel kind of bad for her and her family keeps saying I\u2019m heartless and an asshole.  A few of my buddies online said I was being way too harsh also. AITA?\n\nTLDR; My bio moms been in jail for years and I see my step mom are more of a mom.

That\u2019s more than enough reason not to have a relationship with her now, wtffff?!!!

The father was willing to let them maintain and build a relationship and the mother refused. \n\nAt no point EVER is a child to blame for the circumstances the parents created. And you cannot blame a child for wanting to stay in a stable and loving environment over what appears to be a very toxic and unstable one. \n\nYou opinion is gross and narrow minded.", "Why not accept the affair partner?
