It makes it easier in the future when you want to ask him to do something that would help you but isn\u2019t required of him. May as well be neighborly when you can.\n\nNAH", "He made a very reasonable request. Do you have to do it? Absolutely not.

Or should it be assumed that it may be beyond their driving skill?", "NAH. It\u2019s a public street and as long as you are not violating an official parking regulation, you\u2019re okay. You might want to check out exactly what the mandated distance to park from his drive entrance is. It might be less than you believe and would leave you open to some legal liability. (Two cars crashed at an intersection in front of my house and the first thing one driver did was start measuring off how far my car was parked from the intersection. He was totally gonna try to claim my \u2018negligent parking\u2019 contributed to his car broadsiding the other car. I was in the clear but he was gonna try.) Know the law, OP.", "NAH - This seems like it was a reasonable and respectfully made request. You could have said no if you had a particular reason for parking in that spot or parking elsewhere would be a burden, but if the request is just that you park just one cars length away or so (vs a block away), I don't think its a big deal. I don't think he was \"making it your problem\" I think he was just trying to explain the reason for his request - as you said, you were not doing anything inherently wrong so he probably felt like he had to justify his request. I honestly think you are over thinking this.", "Nah.

How do you plan to handle the next conversation?", "NAH\n\nBut seriously, you might well be blocking his view or turn. Vans are hard to see around and if there are lightpoles or street signs near the driveway it can be really hard to turn out. My old driveway literally was bordered by a pole so I had to be 90% out of it before I could safely turn the wheel. I did reverse in and I can maneuver that thing with the tiniest of clearance but I still had to 80 point turn just to go to work in the morning if people were parked too close. You might give him a couple feet and earn yourself some karma", "NTA.  If he complains again, move the car 6 inches.  Might also be a good idea to get a camera to cover the street for the inevitable collision.", "NAH. He's not an asshole for just asking. You're not an asshole for refusing---but you're not a considerate neighbor either.\n\nYou have a van and that's probably blocking some visibility for him. And you're apparently living where ice/snow is another factor. Why not move your van a little further down as a courtesy? Even an extra foot or two would probably make a difference.", "NTA\n\nIt's a public street. you can park there.  if he hits you, it's his fault.", "NTA\n\nWith that being said, you've been put on notice that he has slid in ice backing out of his driveway. So don't cry when that's exactly what happens.", "It you are parking on a public street and in a legal spot you are NTA.  I just hope he has insurance if he does end up hitting your vehicle.  Perhaps he needs to practice backing up or get a car with a back-up camera so he can see what he's doing.", "Suggest the neighbor back IN to his driveway so he has a clean line of sight pulling out.", "NAH, but why are you getting upset about it? Your neighbor made a perfectly reasonable request. You're also perfectly within your rights to refuse, but why would you? Even if your van isn't blocking his driveway it might be blocking his line of sight or it might be juuuust close enough to his driveway to make turning a little awkward.

Because... So what if he's not a great driver?  He asked nicely, and you agreed.  You can park in your own driveway or anywhere else along the street.  What's so special about those 5 feet of space that you want to knowingly make his life harder?", "NTA, though don't complain if he hits your car since you've been put on notice, make sure your insurance is up to date and if you have a way to record video of your car you should do that. \n\nBut damn man, if you think this is a confrontation you can't deal with then you must have a difficult time navigating the world.", "NTA as it\u2019s a public street.

Cause like... if 4 feet further makes his life easier and doesn't make your life harder....", "perfectly put. street parking is public parking BUT big vans can block views when pulling out and that gets really dangerous. my neighbors park 2 huge vans on either side of my driveway regularly, like all the way up to the edge, and i hate it because it is so hard to see when trying to leave. they even have had the van bumper encroaching into the driveway several times because they have zero sense of neighborly courtesy and suck at driving\n\nsince i have no legal recourse and want to avoid conflict i just put cones in the street to try and encourage people to park an extra 2 feet from the edge of the driveway. that little extra space makes a huge difference. \n\nNAH", "My parents have neighbors that park on the street directly across from their driveway.  It's not an issue for them as they pull out straight.

When the police officer gave his friend a ticket he also talked to the owner of the car and told them it was not wise to park directly across from a driveway.\n\nBottom-line.
