No\n\nCould you easily and safely move up a little and give his driveway extra space? This way if he slides on ice or his view was restricted by your van, it doesn\u2019t end up causing hassles for you.\n\nIf he\u2019s just a neighbor asking for a favor and it\u2019s a harmless request, why not? It makes it easier in the future when you want to ask him to do something that would help you but isn\u2019t required of him. May as well be neighborly when you can.\n\nNAH", "He made a very reasonable request. Do you have to do it? Absolutely not. But parking a few feet over won\u2019t hurt you, and would even win you a friend. Courtesy is so rare these days, I sincerely hope that you will do it. NAH", "Should the suggestion be made to the neighbour that he back into his own driveway and then he can just drive forward out of it? Or should it be assumed that it may be beyond their driving skill?", "NAH. It\u2019s a public street and as long as you are not violating an official parking regulation, you\u2019re okay. You might want to check out exactly what the mandated distance to park from his drive entrance is. It might be less than you believe and would leave you open to some legal liability. (Two cars crashed at an intersection in front of my house and the first thing one driver did was start measuring off how far my car was parked from the intersection. He was totally gonna try to claim my \u2018negligent parking\u2019 contributed to his car broadsiding the other car. I was in the clear but he was gonna try.) Know the law, OP.", "NAH - This seems like it was a reasonable and respectfully made request. You could have said no if you had a particular reason for parking in that spot or parking elsewhere would be a burden, but if the request is just that you park just one cars length away or so (vs a block away), I don't think its a big deal. I don't think he was \"making it your problem\" I think he was just trying to explain the reason for his request - as you said, you were not doing anything inherently wrong so he probably felt like he had to justify his request. I honestly think you are over thinking this.", "Nah. But now that you\u2019ve agreed to it you\u2019ll be TA if you don\u2019t keep your word.", "INFO - so you agreed to not park in that spot, but have since changed your mind. How do you plan to handle the next conversation?", "NAH\n\nBut seriously, you might well be blocking his view or turn. Vans are hard to see around and if there are lightpoles or street signs near the driveway it can be really hard to turn out. My old driveway literally was bordered by a pole so I had to be 90% out of it before I could safely turn the wheel. I did reverse in and I can maneuver that thing with the tiniest of clearance but I still had to 80 point turn just to go to work in the morning if people were parked too close. You might give him a couple feet and earn yourself some karma", "NTA.  If he complains again, move the car 6 inches.  Might also be a good idea to get a camera to cover the street for the inevitable collision.", "NAH. He's not an asshole for just asking. You're not an asshole for refusing---but you're not a considerate neighbor either.\n\nYou have a van and that's probably blocking some visibility for him. And you're apparently living where ice/snow is another factor. Why not move your van a little further down as a courtesy? Even an extra foot or two would probably make a difference.", "NTA\n\nIt's a public street. you can park there.  if he hits you, it's his fault.", "NTA\n\nWith that being said, you've been put on notice that he has slid in ice backing out of his driveway. So don't cry when that's exactly what happens.", "It you are parking on a public street and in a legal spot you are NTA.  I just hope he has insurance if he does end up hitting your vehicle.  Perhaps he needs to practice backing up or get a car with a back-up camera so he can see what he's doing.", "Suggest the neighbor back IN to his driveway so he has a clean line of sight pulling out.", "NAH, but why are you getting upset about it? Your neighbor made a perfectly reasonable request. You're also perfectly within your rights to refuse, but why would you? Even if your van isn't blocking his driveway it might be blocking his line of sight or it might be juuuust close enough to his driveway to make turning a little awkward. Whatever the reason, you initially agreed to his request and now you're stewing about it. Why? Would it really hurt you to to pull up another foot or so and give him some extra space?", "NTA but I\u2019d make sure you have some form of camera watching your car for insurance reasons!", "Mild YTA\n\nYou told him you'd be considerate of his struggles.  Because... So what if he's not a great driver?  He asked nicely, and you agreed.  You can park in your own driveway or anywhere else along the street.  What's so special about those 5 feet of space that you want to knowingly make his life harder?", "NTA, though don't complain if he hits your car since you've been put on notice, make sure your insurance is up to date and if you have a way to record video of your car you should do that. \n\nBut damn man, if you think this is a confrontation you can't deal with then you must have a difficult time navigating the world.", "NTA as it\u2019s a public street.  However, has he hit a car because your work van is blocking his view?  Is there a way to park it so it doesn\u2019t?  Not required by any means but could be a courtesy thing.", "NTA like you said he doesn't own the road. Be prepared for him to hit your car though.", "NTA - its a public street.", "INFO is street parking allowed?", "I think you might live in my house. Is this person blind, has no business being on the road, but if you bring it up to anyone they'll know it's you? Either way, NTA.", "NTA but get a camera to record where you park your car. Might as well get evidence for it so your insurance does not spike", "I guess NTA, but it'd be inconsiderate of you to not comply with his ask if parking a little further from his driveway is possible for you.\n\nMy neighbor has big trucks.. he parks them all the way at the end of his (otherwise entirely empty) driveway. It makes pulling out of mine pretty risky most days. Is he allowed to do that? Obviously, it's his driveway. I do think he's an inconsiderate asshole though.", "INFO\n\nWhat about the way he asked felt like a threat? Did he imply he would do something if you didn't agree?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As someone who drives a big truck I used to haaaaate when my neighbors parked right across from my driveway and one time in the snow I hit their Honda. My truck you couldn\u2019t even see damage, however their Honda door was definitely dented and noticeable. BUT I must add we were in a neighborhood of duplexes with insanely narrow roads, we aren\u2019t talking about the type of neighborhood I grew up in, in California with huuuge wide roads lol it was especially annoying because said neighbor had several other options where he could conveniently park, but because he had 20 people  illegally living in one 2 bd duplex they gave themselves almost no other option. After I hit the Honda they never parked there again for more than 20 mins \ud83d\ude02\n\nEdit to say: Even with my story I still think NTA", "I do feel fos this guy, because I have very poor depth perception and I would struggle with this. But that is my responability- I ask someone else to back our for me in this case. NTA. Park where you wanna, but keep a cam on that car. He might hit it.", "NTA\n\nIf you're parked legally, he needs to be a better driver. Its not up to the world to make way for him and has bad driving.", "NTA. He can't tell you not to park on a public street because he can't drive. As long as you aren't blocking his driveway, you should be free to park there. That said, if you're able to you might want to get a security camera and point it at your parking spot just in case.", "NTA\n\n>\tso he made is my problem that he\u2019s not a competent driver. Also felt like a threat the way he said it.\n\n\nI\u2019d never willingly leave my car so closed to this kind of driver. I think he just did you a favor. 6 months means you started parking in spring.", "NTA but you should tell him that you will be parking there. He\u2019s obviously going to notice and bring it up again.", "I had a neighbor ask the same thing of me \u2014 she had a hard time backing out into a 1.5 lane street with curb parking on the opposite side. I told her that when I could, I'd park elsewhere, and I did. My \"could\" and her probably differed, but trying to park an oversized pickup in extra narrow nose dive spots v. long marked curb spots was a no-brainer, and I often ended up in that spot anyway since three of her immediate neighbors never seemed to move their vehicles.\n\nAll that to say NTA. Only you can decide the lengths you want to go to in order to keep the peace.", "Ask your neighbor to park on the street if he can\u2019t back up. This isn\u2019t your problem.", "NTA. If dude can reverse out of his drive, he can reverse into it. That means he doesn\u2019t have to reverse out of the driveway and risk hitting another vehicle.", "Ya, I guess this is my question too. Is there a reason why THIS spot is particularly better for OP? Cause like... if 4 feet further makes his life easier and doesn't make your life harder....", "perfectly put. street parking is public parking BUT big vans can block views when pulling out and that gets really dangerous. my neighbors park 2 huge vans on either side of my driveway regularly, like all the way up to the edge, and i hate it because it is so hard to see when trying to leave. they even have had the van bumper encroaching into the driveway several times because they have zero sense of neighborly courtesy and suck at driving\n\nsince i have no legal recourse and want to avoid conflict i just put cones in the street to try and encourage people to park an extra 2 feet from the edge of the driveway. that little extra space makes a huge difference. \n\nNAH", "My parents have neighbors that park on the street directly across from their driveway.  It's not an issue for them as they pull out straight. However, the uphill angle of their driveway to the street makes it more difficult to see the parked car. \n One of their friends accidentally hit the parked car one day.  When the police officer gave his friend a ticket he also talked to the owner of the car and told them it was not wise to park directly across from a driveway.\n\nBottom-line.  Assuming you live with similar laws, you are perfectly within your rights to park across from someone's driveway, but that does not make it a wise choice to park there.", "My thought too. We have to back into our driveway because many living here have large families=many cars. This makes it almost impossible to safely back out of the driveways as the view is usually obscured by the many cars on the street. It doesn\u2019t take any extra time in the long run and it\u2019s solve the issue.", "I actually thought of this too, not sure he\u2019s capable of it but i could recommend that to him if he confronts me about it.", "Actually do cry - all the way to his insurance to make him pay for any damage he does. If he can't safely back out of his driveway then he needs to find a better way to park. \"I told you so\" is not a valid reason to damage someone's car.\n\nEdit: fixed typos.", "What a ridiculous thing to say! If the guy hits his car because he\u2019s a bad driver it does not matter at all that he warned him! He\u2019s still a bad driver who is responsible for hitting his car.", "What? People can\u2019t just announce they are bad drivers so no one complains if the bad driver hits them.", "If you're that incompetent of a driver that you can't avoid cars, especially parked ones, you shouldn't have a license. OP would have every right to complain.", "Exactly what I was going to say! \n\nNTA", "Yes, public street with no restrictions.", "If he can back out, he can back in.", "My neighbor has backed into cars across the street from her driveway 4 times in the last 5 years.  Twice to the same vehicle. Yeah insurance will pay for the damage, but do you realize just how frustrating that is to deal with when you are preparing to go to work? The hassle of scheduling repair work, rental cars (assuming they have the right models in stock as a friend had to pay out of pocket when insurance would only cover a sedan and no sedans were available in the required radius), and the overall decrease in the resale value of your vehicle isn't pleasant and no matter who is at fault, it will still cause OP problems. Figuring out a compromise before an accident will help more than getting indignant over the warning.", "What is Danaher and a valid train mean?\n\nOf course he'll go through insurance. I mean don't come crying on here \"my neighbor hit my car\"", "Exactly right!", "\ud83d\ude44 Have you ever driven on ice?\n\nYou have zero traction, zero ability to steer. I'm a truck driver, so the neighbor here is actually trying to prevent OP's car from being damaged.\n\nFull disclosure, I'll never pull out of my driveway if it isn't clean and ESPECIALLY not if there's ice. \n\nThat being said, OP can do whatever the hell they want, but shouldn't get butthurt if their vehicle gets hit due to shir weather", "Then I'd say NTA overall, assuming you're really not blocking his driveway at all. Maybe you're slightly the AH for saying you'd park elsewhere when you didn't mean it.", "So there's literally no reason why someone else couldn't park there? I guess your neighbor thinks he owns the street!\n\nNTA, but you also now know that parking in that spot is dangerous and your vehicle could be damaged. Just because insurance will cover it doesn't mean dealing with the repairs and not being able to use your work truck won't be a nightmare. It's not like most rental car companies have work vehicles in their fleets.", "My apologies - I should have doubled checked before posting. I have edited the post.", "Then you need to put something on the ice to make it safer to drive on or don\u2019t park there if you know it\u2019s not going to be safe to drive on it. Maybe he should park on the street too.", "There is literally nothing you can put on ice to make it safe to drive on. \n\nI'm done debating this. Neighbor warned OP, OP is an adult. OP also could have addressed this themselves, but \"I'm afraid of confrontation\" so I agreed, but then pussied out and changed my mind.", "Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise here.... Salt, gravel and sand are usually used here to keep our icy roads drivable... I mean do you think Canada just stops functioning for half the year???", "Those are put down to melt ice. Go dive a vehicle on ice, throw down some salt and try\n... no difference. \n\nBut yes, I'll defer to you professional drivers. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 \n\nGravel and sand can increase your COF, but they will soon melt into the ice, rendering them moot. \n\nAnd I don't beliebe canada has ICE on the roads for 182.5 days.", "Half was an hyperbole but we have winter weather from end of November to mid to late March (when lucky) and we do use salt, gravel and sand to make our roads usable. We also have de-icying with machinery but that's only for public roads. \n\nYou are responsible to keep your driveway usable and salt, gravel and sand are your best options and yes you will have to apply it almost every day. But that's better then hitting other cars or falling flat on your face!"]}
