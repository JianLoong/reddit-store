A lot of people in their early twenties get trapped into religious dogma.

You never know how his girlfriend convinced him to become a Jehovah's Witness..reason usually has very little do with it. That being said, you're free to do what you want. Don't think this is really an AITA question.", "YTA because of all of the animosity you\u2019re holding for him. Your therapist is suggesting you talk to him not because he *deserves* your forgiveness, but because your hurt feelings about him abandoning the family are eating away at you. This is for *you.* You are wishing the man death. You know that can\u2019t be healthy, right?\n\nJehovah\u2019s Witness can get on a cult level. Not all are, I had a very kind distant aunt that was JW, she was an amazing woman and never made a point of trying to convert us though we weren\u2019t JW; that might be because she wasn\u2019t overly involved in JW services and practiced her faith on her own.\n\nConsidering how heavily indoctrinated your brother may have been, he could\u2019ve suffered from some cult trauma that made him believe he had to isolate himself from the family. Or his wife may have been abusive and manipulative and convinced him to abandon the family. In many scenarios, he could be a victim here. I don\u2019t know. Neither do you. EDIT: Also, he was only *20 years old.* His brain wasn\u2019t even fully developed and he was very freshly independent. It would\u2019ve been VERY easy for him to have been manipulated and indoctrinated, and people are rarely the same between 20 and 30.\n\nYour feelings of being hurt and abandoned are completely valid. You don\u2019t have to force yourself to go back to the way things were before. They can likely never be the same. But I think you\u2019re cheating yourself out of healing; healing doesn\u2019t mean forgiving or forgetting everything, it\u2019s just letting yourself move on and let go of the resentment. You don\u2019t have to be best friends with him or be anything other than cordial during the handful of times you see him a year.

If your therapist suggests something, it\u2019s probably best to set up a conversation with the therapist there to moderate. You\u2019re holding on to a lot of resentment, and while your anger is justified, thinking he doesn\u2019t deserve forgiveness and wishing an early death on him is too far.

Ironically, as your brother made a youthful mistake, so are you. Being so inflexible, and so ignorant to the realities of the types of mistakes that real people make in their lives marks you out as someone very young. Not only should you find a way to start forgiving your brother, but you should start doing it for your own emotional health.

Your brother made bad choices and abandoned you guys. You are hurt. You were betrayed. You have every right to never engage with him again. BUT, if you had a good relationship prior to him and his ex ruining everything, I think you should work with your therapist to see if you can heal and get that relationship back. That said, no one is required to have a relationship with anyone, DNA related or not. I stopped talking to the half brother I grew up with because he is a racist and at the last time I spoke with him, a raging alcoholic. I have no desire to deal with him. I wouldn\u2019t be friends with him, so no need to have a relationship with him just because we share a bit of DNA and some history. Good luck OP", "the OP's sister is correct *Now my sister claims I'm being just as bad as he was, which kinda set me off.*  \n\nand then the OP has the unmitigated audacity to gaslight his sister *I told her by that logic she's just excusing what he did by still talking to him, and she must be bad too.*", "Ok, you were around 13 when he left, correct? I understand him abandoning you, especially at that age must've hurt, but what do you actually gain from this? Wish death on him and hating his hypothetical children does what for you? Not forgiving him does nothing, neither of you gain anything from this, don't think it's worth it to at least try to make up for lost time? At least talk to your sister and see if/how he's changed", "Not controversial at all, they are totally a cult that cuts off family members that didn't drink the kool-aid.", "Nah, it's definitely not controversial.

Ngl I thought about it while reading the comments and he said his brother was gone for 10 years \u2026 this isn\u2019t an excuse but I think the 13 year old him on the inside is still upset and missed his big brother.

The JW cult may have caused more deaths than all other religious cults combined!\n\nWhat makes the JWs particularly dangerous is their public veneer of moderation. They seem almost mainstream and harmless. There are no spectacular, headline-grabbing, mass-suicide events. To the ignorant public they don't appear to fit the profile of the most extreme cults normally portrayed in the media. But hidden away from public view is the deadly undercurrent of harmful ideologies and practices that destroy lives and take lives in single incidents scattered across the globe over decades.

Adults understand that life - and the choices that we make - are not black and white.  Hopefully you'll get a more mature and reasonable mindset soon, and won't look back and regret your inability to step outside of yourself and see the entire situation outside of your pain.", "He was lured into a cult and brainwashed.\n\nHe is a victim.\n\nPlease research stories of former cult members and how difficult it can be to recognize what\u2019s happening.", "Much like you are an adult, one who is older and wiser than he was when he left.
