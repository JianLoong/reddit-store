I 19 F have known my best friend 18F ( i\u2019m going to call her M) for most of my life. we haven\u2019t really gotten close until high-school rolled around. but throughout my life we have always had sleepovers and occasionally hung out. Now this happened a few months ago. I came home from my boyfriends house two days after having a sleepover with her. I was talking to my mother and that\u2019s when she dropped the bomb on me. My father was talking to a mutual of her family and the friend said hey did you hear about M\u2019s dad he\u2019s on the SO list. Me and my mother horrified went and checked online and there we are staring right at the picture of him with his charges. He had two charges one from over 20 years ago and another from within the past year. After searching up the charges we found that they were most likely for watching bad content of kids. \nNow mind you my friend has been actively having me sleep over her house without no warning whatsoever and had never sat me down or told me anything about this. Her parents have never talked to my parents about it either so my family and i had no way of ever knowing this without searching it up. and nobody purposely searches their friends dad up on the website. When talking to my parents about it they told me i should no longer go over her house. Since he is a repeated so going over her house could put me in danger. It is so hard to be able to hang out with her now though. As she doesn\u2019t drive so normally i make the commute to her house. now i will have to pick her up and drop her off from my house every time we want to hang out\nConfronting her could also be extremely difficult. I am sure that she is most likely aware but if she is not breaking that news to her would be very difficult as she is extremely closed off. Everyone has told me avoiding and distance would be the best approach to take but I would rather sit down and talk to her.", "created_utc": 1688995945, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vu6mi/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_friends_house_after/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I 19 F have known my best friend 18F ( i\u2019m going to call her M) for most of my life. we haven\u2019t really gotten close until high-school rolled around. but throughout my life we have always had sleepovers and occasionally hung out. Now this happened a few months ago. I came home from my boyfriends house two days after having a sleepover with her. I was talking to my mother and that\u2019s when she dropped the bomb on me. My father was talking to a mutual of her family and the friend said hey did you hear about M\u2019s dad he\u2019s on the SO list.

He had two charges one from over 20 years ago and another from within the past year. After searching up the charges we found that they were most likely for watching bad content of kids. \nNow mind you my friend has been actively having me sleep over her house without no warning whatsoever and had never sat me down or told me anything about this. which personally i believe that if she didn\u2019t want to tell me she should\u2019ve just always suggested my house or said she wasn\u2019t allowed to have people over. I had no knowledge on this whatsoever since my mother told me so obviously i was very freaked out by it. I would confront her but also if she doesn\u2019t know i don\u2019t want to be the one to break it to her that her dad is a repeat SO. I feel like after this incident I have to distance myself. This has burnt many bridges between the both of us as now I refuse to go to her house. She doesn\u2019t drive either so every-time we hang out i have to pick her up to bring her to my house and then drop her back off afterwards.  I know her dad most likely wouldn\u2019t try anything but knowing all of this information makes me extremely uncomfortable being around her family now. I feel like i am ditching her for something out of her control but genuinely if she sat down and talked to me about this we could\u2019ve figured it out together. As his charge is a public record and can be found anywhere online. Also I feel that in a way her family should\u2019ve taken initiative her parents know my parents and if they family did want me knowing i feel as if they should\u2019ve talked to my parents and atleast made them aware about this situation\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That's not exactly family dinner conversation. Sounds like you're blaming the wrong person. \n\nJust talk to her and let her know what is being circulated about her dad, and then be a friend to her while she processes it. You don't have to sleep over to be a good friend.", "If he is on the SO list for watching child P-rn, then he is no danger to you. Men who like child p-rn or who do even worse things with actual children have a target age range. So since you are not a child, you are out of his range.", "Friends dad is the same person today that he was yesterday. Today is as safe as yesterday was.\n\n20 years ago Dad watched underaged porn.  You aren't underaged.\n\nOf course you should talk to your friend. You didn't frame what action might make you TA, so I can't make a judegment.", "This precisely. If she\u2019s your friend you can sit and discuss this. I\u2019m sure this is a burden for her and it would be a shame if she lost your friendship over this.", "I think it would be better if OP's parents reached out to the friend's parents and told them they don't feel comfortable having their child go to the house and why.", "While it's mentioned that mom thinks OP might be in danger (and truly she might still be. My father assaulted me at a young age (before 5) and then a 12 year old, then a 24 year old and then me again at 16.) It's more so the fact that it sounds like OP was having sleepovers while she was still a preteen and kid. This fear is rooted in the fact that she could've been a victim potentially and that is terrifying. Don't minimize that shit.", "That is an assumption. And likely a bad one at that.", "What a terrible day to have reading comprehension. You're fully advocating that it's fine to be around a child predator *who was a constant presence through her childhood* because she's not a kid anymore? If you turn your cheek, it's still happening. This is the kind of attitude that leads to predators being protected, instead of exposed for what they are so people can be safe.\n\nAlso, one charge at all is too many, but check how one violation was 20 years ago and then there was ANOTHER WITHIN THE LAST YEAR.", "i have hung out with her since i was ten years old. i have been in their house as a child a pre teen a teen and now and adult. sorry this is my first post and honestly i didn\u2019t know how to word it but basically is it bad for me to distance myself and end the friendship after this", "you:\n\n>20 years ago Dad watched underaged porn\n\nmeanwhile in the actual post:\n\n>He had two charges one from over 20 years ago and **another from within the past year**\n\n  \ni am once again BEGGING people read the whole post before they decide to spout awful takes on the internet.", "They\u2019re child is 19 tho so she should tell her friend herself", "I stated some facts. The only thing I advocated was that OP should talk to her friend, whose been accused of nothing.", "It doesn\u2019t have to be friendship ending if you two agree to communicate online and spend time elsewhere. Your friend may be a victim here much more than you. There is a good chance that she has been raised to think daddy\u2019s little secret normal thing.", "Except she doesn't know if her friend even knows. And she's living at home and having sleepovers. She didn't magically become a fully independent adult on her 18th birthday."]}
