In fact, I assume that she'd just assume you shared with her after they left. \n\nYes, making jiaozi is a communal, bounding, dare I say fun process and your sister should have joined. Indeed she likely doesn't know what she missed. But when you make jiaozi, you make them for the whole family. You make Extras and freeze them for later. In China you often share them with neighbours.
