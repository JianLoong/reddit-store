I have 14 aunts and uncles by blood, each have 2-3 kids.  We only give gifts if we are seeing the kid in person on the event.  Even that peters out at like 10-12.  I haven\u2019t gotten a gift from my aunts and uncles since I was a young teen.  If they were with me on my birthday, I got to pick the restaurant.  That was my gift.  Even my grandparents only got me something if I was in the same state as them.  Cash is king.  For my own nieces and nephews, I throw a twenty in a card with a thoughtful note.  That goes up to forty when they turn 14 or so.

Just my opinion, but can it really be fair when one side has 2  kids and the other side has 7+ kids AND your trying to be money conscious?   I'd say different rules for different sides. Can you do a secret Santa like thing on your  side of the family since there aare so many kids? Like I'm sure you're sibling with 5 kids didn't expect you to keep buyomg gifts for that many kids for birthday and Xmas. Maybe split it up between your siblings. Sibling 1 gets child x & y gifts for birthday. You get gifts for child a,b &c. Then secret Santa it for Xmas. \n\nAs for your husband's side, 2 kids isn't a lot, but really  stick to your budget. \n\nA great way to keep in that $20 budget is a self care basket from the dollar store. Fill it up with chocolate, face masks, lotion, crafts, books, mugs, etc.  If their parents really believe it's the thought behind it, they should be no problem! \n\nAnother way to keep the cost low if you're really believe you have to be fair between the sides it's give them all the same thing. Everyone gets something economical from you, like a  batch of cookies you baked for their birthdays.  .\n\nOr just start with the rule that they get gifts if you see them  on their birthday. That's how it's always been for my family! \n\nGood luck , it's hard I know, especially in this economy and with a  kid on the way!", "NTA. That\u2019s a huge expectation. Do secret Santa or something and talk to your siblings. They\u2019ll likely understand.", "Nta. Bite the bullet and take a year off gift giving. You'll have maternity leave, the economy sucks, inflation and see how it goes", "NTA, I can totally relate.  I have 7 siblings and out of us 8, I am the only one who is childless.  I have 28 nieces and nephews, 11 of whom are married.  This does not even include great-nieces/nephews.  When the niblings were under 18, my sinlings drew names for all the grandkids, according to however many kids were in their household.  For example, My oldest brother had five children, so he drew 5 names (not his own kids) and bought five gifts.  Since I didn\u2019t have children of my own, I bought only for my god son.", "NTA, 11 kids is too damn many and presents don't = love. Someone suggested gift cards, maybe it would be reasonable to do a $5-10 gift card of some kind for them for birthdays because like you say, finding a different physical gift for every birthday for less than $20 will be impossible for you.

I have alot of grandkids, and it does get really expensive. I usually start christmas shopping in June. As they get older, their tastes get more expensive. The little ones are happy with a barbie doll, or small lego set..older ones are another story. I also base what I spend on the families situation. If the parents are less well off financially, the gifts tend to be a little more expensive so the kids get what they want for christmas. Heres the kicker, the kids get what they want, but the adults have to deal with the justification. I have two grown boys, with no children, they get better gifts than the rest of the adults, as their money goes towards the children having nicer things. The \"parents\" will get token gifts from us.", "NTA but there are other ways. When we were growing up, my Aunty Pauline used to give us kids 'hampers' - bags of treats, like lollies, variety packs of cereals, chips, etc. The big deal was that everyone got exactly the same and no one had to share. We LOVED it.\n\nAfter she died, I decided to continue the tradition for my nieces and nephews - they love it too. They especially love the no sharing!

There just is.\n\nI had a similar setup. On my moms side there were four of us, me and my 2 brothers and a single cousin. On my dad's side there were 14 of us.\n\nOn my moms side all the aunts uncles bought birthday/Christmas gifts for all the kids. Just how it was. \n\nOn my dad's side though there were no Christmas gifts from aunts and uncles. Grandparents did, but no aunts and uncles. They did however give birthday presents still. Those were more spread out and thus not such a big amount all at once and cutting just one of those gift giving occasions was still a big saving. \n\nIt's perfectly cool to talk to the adults on both sides about potential changes. If people agree to change that's great. It's very much something though where you should go with what the majority on each side want, even if the 2 sides of your family don't agree. Otherwise either your kids are going to be the only ones not getting aunt/uncle gifts on one side and you're going to come across badly with your nieces/nephews. I mean, if it's truly a hardship and you can't afford it, that is what it is, don't go hungry to buy gifts, but part of joining a family is often joining their traditions at least with them, even when that's different from what you might have otherwise done.", "NTA but what about instead doing a lower-priced fun family gift?

Once we turned 12, my aunts & uncles mostly gave cards with a gift card or a few dollars along with some candy or trinkets; not everyone can afford lavish gifts for all children in a growing family especially when you're financially mindful of how expensive it's becoming. It's rich that your bil is saying to stop focusing on the $$ but gifts cost $$ to begin with.\n\nMy husband & I have a Sinking Fund that we contribute every month to to cover gifts for family members to make it easier on our wallets come holiday season/birthdays then whatever isn't spent gets rolled over to a special occasion fund (graduations/weddings/baby gifts/sympathy gifts).", "Suggest a name draw because yes, this is ridiculous.", "Easy NTA. You're bankrupting yourselves for gifts they don't even appreciate. Fuck that noise.", "NTA. I feel like whichever solution you choose will always leave someone unhappy or grumpy. So maybe just choose the solution that\u2019s best for you. Initially, people will complain but overtime, they\u2019ll just get accustom. \n\n1. You can choose to forgo birthdays and just give gifts for Christmas. In our family, birthdays doesn\u2019t automatically mean presents, unless it\u2019s a big one, like 13,16, and 21. \n\n2. My fianc\u00e9 and his mom do a weekly savings every year, so if they save $5 each every week, they\u2019ll have around $250 at the end of the year. For them, it\u2019s easier to put aside $5 than pull out $200 at the end of the year. \n\nYou can\u2019t make everyone happy, so just save yourself the extra stress.", "I grab stockings and fill them with candy, games, trinkets, etc. I cap it at $10 each. For birthdays I send $10 gift cards. NTA \n\nUngrateful people always ruin it for everyone else.", "NTA. But my husband and I use our own money for families. His play money is used for his nieces/nephews, I use money for mine", "My family has the rule of no niece or nephew gifts after the age of 12. It works great and 12 is old enough to explain that aunts and uncles will no longer do gifts. It is never expected that aunt and uncle gifts are expensive. Parents should be teaching children that it is the thought that counts.", "NTA. Christmas has become a gross commercialized mess and a source of unnecessary stress for many. Just the thought of having to wrap presents for eight additional adults and eleven kids seems daunting! You're smart to be thinking of alternatives to this trend.\n\nAnd... I don't know how I would tell my young loved ones that I'm going to stop giving them presents (let alone at the age of ten). I would change the nature of my gift. How would you explain it to your own child in the reverse, if one of their aunts or uncles stopped giving them gifts? (Not taking shots, just that seems like a useful point of reference.)", "NTA. You don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to stop buying gifts. Gifts are voluntary.", "NTA.\n\nThey're greedy and ungrateful. \n\nAnd you don't have to *buy* them anything. If their parents are so crazed for them to get presents, let their parents do the buying.", "op=NTA\n\nBluntly, if your ONE gift missing is so obvious that your niblings notice, then their parents(/grandparents) aren't do their job.\n\nSo LONG as you don't expect gifts from them for your child(which technically you should get for all the years you did buy), you are fine.", "NTA, we also have a lot of nieces and nephews. In my side we only buy a gift for our godchild at Xmas but a secret Santa works well too with that amount of kids. On my husbands side we buy family gifts. Generally like board games and chocolates. We still get bday gifts for all of them but maybe cutting back at Christmas will help you guys out. The cost of living is on the up people need to be a bit more realistic nowadays.", "We stopped buying gifts for our siblings families a long time ago!!", "Are you crafty? Maybe start making homemade gifts for the kids.", "How does a secret santa work for the kids?", "Yes! We do white elephant exchange too and it is a great way to keep costs lower! \n\nWe also do a \u2018grab bag\u2019 type gift for the children, example; each adult buys 1 or 2 (depending on number of children) child gifts and then the kids draw numbers to get order of draw for picking a gift. There is a dollar limit for gift cost and the gifts are neutral gifts so what ever is picked can be used by the child that picks it. Of course, if there are large age gaps then the gifts would be separated by age groups. Most of our younger relatives are close in age so hasn\u2019t been an issue.", "we started it when the youngest cousin was 14ish so the parents helped the youngest cousin pick out a gift and pay for it.\n\nIf there was a lot of little kids, the parents would likely still have to buy the gifts that the kids give, but still would reduce the number of gifts needed to buy considerably", "We did it secret santa this year, they even have a app to randomly pick names and each person can add a wish list. It was easy fun and affordable.", "> being ungrateful even when they\u2019ve gotten so much more.\n\nSometimes it's not worth trying to make people like that happy. I would even decrease the budget and just get them books. Show them what boring could really be (caveat that I don't think books are boring, and these kids might even learn something about not being greedy if they read one)", "I meant more of the game aspect. Usually you can\u2019t steal gifts in a gift exchange. It makes it an activity, not just an exchange.", "It's her side of the family with the seven nieces and nephews and more in the pipeline that she's concerned about. Also, OP notes they are having conversations together with the families (plural). I'm a bit sensitive to emotional load disparities, too, but that does not appear to be the issue here."]}
