Not cool. So I'd say no too. I would go one step further and block them as well!", "NTA. Her bills are not your responsibility.", "ESH\n\nThey've misunderstood how difficult it is to live off grid and they're expecting you to just bail them out.\n\nYou're refusing to help them financially, which is fine, but it also doesn't sound like you're asking them what practical steps they're taking to build their resilience and independence.

Feels like a lot of context is missing. How old is everyone? How many siblings do you have? Is everyone contributing or are you the only one being asked? Who is \"they\"? Are \"they\" working?

You\u2019re not responsible for anyone except yourself", "NTA. Stop giving them money because you're not going to get it back.", "Agreed.\n\nBut I want to add to it..... \n\n\n>She spent all the money on poor decisions\n\n\n.....and she's doing nothing to fix or mitigate the situation.", "It's not her job to police what they do and how they do it.

So far ( I've asked ) only myself and a former step father is being asked. No one on the 10 acres is working..\nAs for getting cash in...sell some of the collection of stuff they took with them...they stuffed a huge uhaul full of stuff...and had to make another trip for the leftovers...\nShe  ( mother) wanted land....for what? At one point..was going to be  a hippie place..another time ..cattle farm...another time everyone  was gonna move there and..do something. \nIt's changed a lot", "When I see brother drowning I jump in to pull him out, I don't stand on the side and yell \"You knew what you were in for when you got in\" at him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, someone needs to tell her to stop asking for money, and tell her to figure it out.

It isn't  at all. And you analogy isn't valid, OP is not watching them drown, literally or figuratively.", "Currently  mother is 'trying' to go on disability. Last I heard she is not actually going to doctors to get forms filled out.

If she can't even be bothered to do the work to get tax payer cash, why should you be supporting her?\n\nThat said, sounds like it's impacting your relationship with your family, so it doesn't really matter if you are the AH or not. All that matters is if you want to have a decent relationship with them. Honestly don't know how that will work long term. You'll likely have issues like this the rest of your life.
