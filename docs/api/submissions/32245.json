Today she told me it\u2019s all gone. \n\nWhen she first received the money I asked to be put on the account to monitor her spending and both her and her mom told me I had no right to the account.

Of course there are monthly expenses that are to be expected like water/power and groceries but she spent absurd amounts of money. She bought 400 dollar pans, her friend convinced her to spend 400 dollars on plants for the house. Amazon deliveries almost daily. She booked 3 multi-thousand dollar vacations for the kids this summer and any time I questioned her spending she would get combative and say that her dad would want her to have fun and spoil the kids. We ate out dozens and dozens of times. I talked my wife out of making thousands dollars purchases multiple times all in vain because the money we were supposed to use as a safety net is now gone. I know she is depressed about her dad and she\u2019s always had a spending problem so I expected a little retail therapy but I feel what has happened is partially my fault for not being more aggressive in my approach to monitor her spending. I\u2019m not saying I didn\u2019t spend money over the last few months on a few unnecessary purchases but I had money coming in from my job. I feel like she squandered financial security for our family. We argued pretty bad about it today and I said \u201cthis is why I wanted access to the account!\u201d she called me an asshole and said she set us up for the next year (she did) and \u201cyou\u2019re not gonna tell me how to spend my dad\u2019s blood money!\u201d The only thing that gives me relief is that I\u2019m going back to work from an extended paternal leave next week. I\u2019m conflicted with how things turned out with the money. I had no right to what her dad left her but I also believe she should have given me access to it at the same time because I feel like burning through almost 100k is absurd, irresponsible and unacceptable but it wasn\u2019t my money so this is why I ask am I the asshole?\n\n\nEdit: there are other factors in the situation that I failed to mention. I commented and have responded to multiple comments. Please see them for more info on the matter. Mainly the fact that she didn\u2019t pay her student loans when she said she was going to and her spending has put us in major debt is the past on multiple occasions ", "created_utc": 1701598956, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189qr2r/aita_for_expecting_my_wife_to_do_better_with_her/", "score": 571, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I believe both people need to have a thorough understanding of how to guide a meaningful financial life together.\n\nIf the money was invested properly then they could have had both a safety blanket and she could have used a percentage of the earnings every year for her own reasons and the could have persisted into the future. \n\nUnfortunately in this case it sounds like she has an addition and while it was her choice to spend it... I think OP was wise to realize that she has a problem and to try and protect the asset both for her and her family.", "INFO: did you refuse to go on these vacations or eat out at these restaurants?", "ESH\n\nGet out now while there is no shared debt. She doesn\u2019t think she has a problem and she will accumulate more debt soon", "YTA. She is an adult and that is not your inheritance.", "Honestly based on all the additional info in your comments I'd seriously consider getting out of this marriage before she bankrupts you.", "So I\u2019ve been told I left out important information on the original post. \n\nReading a lot of the comments saying I ATAH have definitely shed a new light on the situation and I thank you for the brutal honesty. \n\nHer spending has put us into debt in the past multiple times. \nShe asked me to take an extended leave of absence on top of a paternal leave from work and that all bills would be taken care of and now there is no money left for bills. \n\nShe was supposed to pay her student loans with this money and she didn\u2019t. \n\nA lot of comments saying I sound controlling by wanting to monitor her spending. I meant it literally when I say that. I just wanted to observe her spending so I could try to be a voice of reason. \n\nMy wife rarely works and I was the main breadwinner for the better part of 5 years. She had access to any and all money coming in and I never objected to that. Now that she has money (or had) it\u2019s HER money and I find that to be wrong but i do surrender that I had no right to that money. However if the roles were reversed she would definitely demand access to the account and I think that might be my biggest issue.\n\nEdit: another thing I forgot to mention is that my wife has applied for loans in my name without my permission before as recently as earlier this year when i received a call asking if it was ok if a car dealership ran my credit so see what I qualified for. I also received a notice In the mail that I was denied for a 50,000 loan. It\u2019s things like this that left me so eager to have input on her spending.\n\nEdit: to those of you who say it\u2019s not my money and I have no right to control how she spends it, you are correct but she is literally already trying to set up another vacation to see her mother out of state and she is planning to use some of our tax return to do it. Before she ran out of money she tried planning a vacation that I flat out denied this time around but she had already purchased airfare so she\u2019s saying it won\u2019t be that much if we still go and use our taxes. This is something that I KNOW I have a right to oppose and I will be extremely defensive of that money. \n\nEdit: I\u2019ve been advised to seek a divorce by a lot of you. I love my wife and I love my family. My children are my biggest joy and I don\u2019t want to cause them any trauma if there is a possibility to avoid it. My wife is obviously still grieving the loss of her dad and she says she may have postpartum depression. Asking for a divorce during the most difficult time in her life is something I don\u2019t feel right doing. Yes she has problems with money and has had those problems for years but she is a good person and I feel that she can overcome her issues. We have recently discussed setting a new budget with our new expenses and we plan on doing that soon. I suggested that she see a therapist or psychiatrist and she has taken steps towards that. In the past any type of argument has given me great anxiety and I\u2019ve basically let her do what she wants so long as we don\u2019t argue. I\u2019ve been taking anxiety medication for a few months now and I feel like I\u2019m better capable to stand up for myself and speak my mind and I think that will also help our situation moving forward. In the past when I\u2019ve said I wanted to play a bigger role In our finances she said I didn\u2019t know what I was doing and I wouldn\u2019t have any idea how to pay any bills. I won\u2019t accept that answer any longer and will be looking into every statement to see exactly where our money is going .", "After seeing the comments about her putting them into debt before.\n\nNTA\n\nShe's learned a whole new level of spending.

But with her financial history I don't blame you.", "YTA\n\nYou seem to have been counting too much on that inheritance money your wife received. She took care of you and your family first; which was a loving thing for her to do. Instead of appreciating her thoughtfulness and encouraging her to spend the money however she felt was best, you got greedy. She was right to prevent your greed from interfering with her father's wishes. Face the facts, you did not receive a windfall or suffer the loss of your beloved father in this situation; this is all about your wife. Show your grieving wife some emotional support, respect, and appreciation for her loving generosity.", "YTA You know you didn't have to eat out and go on vacation also but you are happy to live it up then when she gets something for her self you are like no this is our money not yours.", "NTA. Funny how this sub works, when its a guy wasting money its a partnership and things have to be discussed. When a women blows through 100k the guy should stfu because its not his money.", "YTA\n\nYou absolutely have no right to monitor your wife\u2019s spending of her own money especially since she spent half of it on important things for your family. That\u2019s fairly concerning, controlling behaviour You\u2019re coming at this from a place of judgement and superiority, thinking that you know better than her. Did you mutually agree that you would save this money as a safety net? If not, that should have been the conversation. Not \u201cyou can\u2019t be trusted\u201d but \u201chey I was thinking we should put some of that in a savings account we don\u2019t touch so that we have a safety net. What do you think?\u201d Being more \u201cagressive\u201d is not what would make this right. \n\nIf your wife does have a problem being responsible with money, she does need to seek help for that. And I think if you have a family, very big financial decisions should be discussed. But your attitude that if you were just in charge and keeping her in line is what makes you the AH here. You have different values and habits around spending money. Yours are not automatically morally superior unless she is accumulating debt for both of you, which it sounds like she isn\u2019t. I think you guys would benefit from some couples therapy.", "[deleted]", "YTA, she paid out your shared debt, cars and so on. That's already more that enough.

Cause it's her money not his, and therefore it's also his money and not hers right?\n\nI find this whole separation of finance between husband and wife quite nonsense actually. Because it's like saying, hey, let's separate the money and if you are poor and I am rich when we are in our 60s, too bad, you continue working while I retire and go holiday.", "NTA. You're already back in debt because of her. And she's the one who put you in debt in the first place.

YTA \n\nIt's her money not yours. Go away.", "This one is a hard one because I can understand both sides. On one hand, she is right, her dad left her the money and she should get to decide what to do with it. She also did help pay off debts and set you guys up for the next year with rent being paid. On the other hand, I definitely understand your side too. It\u2019s extremely irresponsible to spend almost 100K so quickly (although the vacation for next summer was nice). Although I don\u2019t think you should have access to the account, I do think check-ins about the amount left would have been appropriate since you mentioned she has/had a spending issue. I would say NTA because you have every right to be upset that she spent so much when she should have saved (or invested) at least a little bit of the money that was left.", "YTA. You have no say in how she spends \u2018her\u2019 money. I get the impression you\u2019re a bit of a control freak.", "YTA. Not your money.

Your wife is an idiot for spending it but you had no right to control it.", "NTA having read the other comments by OP - but OP hasn\u2019t phrased it very well. \u201cMonitor\u201d is not a good word in this situation.", "Start saving what you would have spent in rent more if you can. No meals out, no holidays until you can have your safety net. No access for wife to it.", "YTA This money was a windfall, and it sounds like you benefitted from it. While I think she was stupid to spend that much money that quickly, it's really not your business to monitor her spending. If this was her paycheck, I'd think differently, but this is not money you ever planned to have.", "NAH. Is your money separated and not in a joint account? Do you give her access to your own money? Because if so, then having her spend tens of thousands of your own money whilst restricting her own with no input from you would be unfair.", "NTA.  For any sudden windfall, especially one that is 100K or more...\n\nThat money should be invested.  There are very safe mutual funds that pay 15% a year, and that money is fully insured by the government.  To invest costs nothing, as all you need to do is open a free online brokerage account with etrade or schwab or whatever, and link a bank account to it to transfer funds.  \n\nLet's put this in perspective.  If she'd invested 200K, that would provide 30K of income for your family.  Let's say she sets up automatic withdrawals of 500 a week.  That means you have passive income of $500 a week AND your brokerage account still grows by $4K a year.  Not bad.  Could your family use an extra $500 a week?\n\nNow let's look at what she did.  Paid off debt.  That's a good idea if the debt is charging more than 15% a year, such as credit card debt.  Otherwise, it's better to invest the money and use dividends to pay down debt.  Paid off cars, registration, insurance.  Bad idea.  I doubt the car loans were charging more than 15% per year, so she's throwing money away (that money could have been earning 15% a year).  I don't think registration and car insurance can be financed.  So that money is a total loss.  Same with rent.  Paying it a year in advance is causing you to lose money, as that money is not earning interest for you.  \n\nGiving 15K to mom, booking multiple vacations, eating out a lot.  All money wasted.  For just one example, the properly invested money could have given you passive income of $500 a week.  Not that it's a good idea to eat out a lot.  But $500 a week of passive income would allow you to eat out often, essentially for free.  (because you are not working to cover the cost of eating out)\n\nAll this is moot, as the money is gone now.  But if you ever get a serious windfall again, it might be prudent to take charge and make sure that money is properly invested.", "YTA\n\nFirst, what makes you think you are entitled to her money? Second, what makes you think you can judge her spending habits when it doesn't affect you?", "You\u2019re a gigantic AH. You loved that she got that money cause you did think you were entitled to it. Monitor the spending? Even her mum knew you were overstepping when you brought it up. \n\nIt\u2019s her money, her first priority was to clear debt and ensure you guys have a roof over your head for the next year. Then she moved on to spoiling the family with holidays etc, you\u2019re acting as if she spent it all on herself! \n\nGet off your high horse thinking you would have managed the money better, it wasn\u2019t yours to begin with.", "ESH - she doesn't seem that bad if she used half to clear debt and to pay off rent for a year - you breeze through that bit like it's nothing. You benefit from that too. \nHowever, blowing through 100k is not great.\nHave you and your wife considered therapy? If she's done this in the past, she may have some issues with compulsive shopping. Buying and spending may be a way for her to satisfy a good or need.\nEither way you both suck in this instance because she needs to get control of her spending and you need to remember that she threw down half her inheritance on stuff you benefit from as well.", "Eh... very soft YTA?  \n\n\nI mean, yes, I can completely see why you're angry and upset, I would be too.  Spending \u00a3100K in one year with no way to replace it - spending thousands of dollars on holidays when you have student loan debt - is really, really incredibly stupid and just the idea makes me twitchy and angry as hell.  \n\nBut at the same time, your wife is correct to say this is money she inherited from her father and she, and only she, got to decide how to spend it. And now she's spent it. \n\nThe money has gone, no getting it back: there is no point getting angry about that. She has blown everything she inherited from her dad in one year of overspending, and now you need to move on on the basis that effectively, she's in the same state she would have been if her dad had cut her off without a penny. So you're actually no worse off than you would have been if that had happened.", "Going against the grain here, but NTA. You're married. You should have input. \n\nI also don't think your wife knows what \"blood money\" is. Insurance money is designed to take care of your loved ones after you die.

Controlling and manipulative", "YTA you said it yourself it HER money and you wanted to control it!", "NTA", "NTA you're a couple and all of it should go to help the family.

She paid loans, rent etc as she should have done for her family and then she WASTED 100k and you all seem to have no problem with that, she could have spend some and invest or save the rest for her Child/children.

Therefore, get your sorry ass and apologise for your selfish and entitled attitude and then get your ass to work, make money and contribute to your family\u2019s life as she did.

I\u2019m not saying I didn\u2019t spend money over the last few months on a few unnecessary purchases but I had money coming in from my job. I feel like she squandered financial security for our family.

Because she just doesn't get it that the family's prosperity (including her hubby's) is what she signed up to protect and promote.  \n\nWhat makes this shit particularly irritating are divorce courts, in the U.S. in particular.

Then later she files for divorce and takes half HIS money, as well.   \n\nYou write that she spent the money building memories with her family and kids, and those memories are valuable.  OK.  She still f\\*cked up.\n\nGoogle qqq  (stock ticker).  Note how it's up like 35% in the past year.  That isn't normal, but normally it does perform quite well anyway.  So let's say 200K invested in a very safe mutual fund.  $70K passive income last year.  Historically, it would be closer to $30K.  But let's assume it pays somewhere between $30K and $70K a year.\n\nThat's $30K to $70K a year in passive income in a very safe investment.

Discuss having one joint account for shared bills, to which you both contribute money for all of the debts and expenses, which you manage (though you keep her in the loop) for the both of you. This way you can ensure that her student loans eventually get paid off, and can discuss her spending/credit status with her on the regular (and help her keep her personal debt down by asking that she send over enough to pay off her credit card each month). Encourage her to also set up a separate joint savings with an automatic contribution of 10% of each of your earnings so that you can build that safety net that you want. If she doesn't want to do that as a joint account, then you should do separate accounts. You also need to \"replace\" your 401K investment in some way.\n\nNTA for hoping for better from her.
