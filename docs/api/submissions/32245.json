Today she told me it\u2019s all gone. \n\nWhen she first received the money I asked to be put on the account to monitor her spending and both her and her mom told me I had no right to the account. I assume her mom said no because I would question the 15k she eventually gave her and I know my wife said no because I would question her spending. Her parents were divorced but her mom maintained the insurance policy. \n\nI saw her spending habits getting out of hand early and would confront her to which she always replied \u201cyou don\u2019t get to tell me how to spend my dad\u2019s blood money!\u201d Now here we are months later with almost nothing left. Of course there are monthly expenses that are to be expected like water/power and groceries but she spent absurd amounts of money. She bought 400 dollar pans, her friend convinced her to spend 400 dollars on plants for the house. Amazon deliveries almost daily. She booked 3 multi-thousand dollar vacations for the kids this summer and any time I questioned her spending she would get combative and say that her dad would want her to have fun and spoil the kids. We ate out dozens and dozens of times. I talked my wife out of making thousands dollars purchases multiple times all in vain because the money we were supposed to use as a safety net is now gone. I know she is depressed about her dad and she\u2019s always had a spending problem so I expected a little retail therapy but I feel what has happened is partially my fault for not being more aggressive in my approach to monitor her spending. I\u2019m not saying I didn\u2019t spend money over the last few months on a few unnecessary purchases but I had money coming in from my job. I feel like she squandered financial security for our family.

I\u2019m conflicted with how things turned out with the money. I had no right to what her dad left her but I also believe she should have given me access to it at the same time because I feel like burning through almost 100k is absurd, irresponsible and unacceptable but it wasn\u2019t my money so this is why I ask am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1701598956, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189qr2r/aita_for_expecting_my_wife_to_do_better_with_her/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I believe both people need to have a thorough understanding of how to guide a meaningful financial life together.\n\nIf the money was invested properly then they could have had both a safety blanket and she could have used a percentage of the earnings every year for her own reasons and the could have persisted into the future. \n\nUnfortunately in this case it sounds like she has an addition and while it was her choice to spend it...

I just wanted to observe her spending so I could try to be a voice of reason. \n\nMy wife rarely works and I was the main breadwinner for the better part of 5 years. She had access to any and all money coming in and I never objected to that. Now that she has money (or had) it\u2019s HER money and I find that to be wrong but i do surrender that I had no right to that money. However if the roles were reversed she would definitely demand access to the account and I think that might be my biggest issue.\n\nEdit: another thing I forgot to mention is that my wife has applied for loans in my name without my permission before as recently as earlier this year when i received a call asking if it was ok if a car dealership ran my credit so see what I qualified for.

She took care of you and your family first; which was a loving thing for her to do. Instead of appreciating her thoughtfulness and encouraging her to spend the money however she felt was best, you got greedy. She was right to prevent your greed from interfering with her father's wishes. Face the facts, you did not receive a windfall or suffer the loss of your beloved father in this situation; this is all about your wife.

That\u2019s fairly concerning, controlling behaviour You\u2019re coming at this from a place of judgement and superiority, thinking that you know better than her. Did you mutually agree that you would save this money as a safety net? If not, that should have been the conversation. Not \u201cyou can\u2019t be trusted\u201d but \u201chey I was thinking we should put some of that in a savings account we don\u2019t touch so that we have a safety net.

And I think if you have a family, very big financial decisions should be discussed. But your attitude that if you were just in charge and keeping her in line is what makes you the AH here. You have different values and habits around spending money. Yours are not automatically morally superior unless she is accumulating debt for both of you, which it sounds like she isn\u2019t. I think you guys would benefit from some couples therapy.", "YTA.\n\nHer dad died, she inherited it. You have absolutely no claim to that money. She was responsible with it.

That's already more that enough. You aren't entitled to monitoring her or anything, she is a grown up woman, not a toddler. It was meant as your safety net to begin with, at least doesn't seem like she eanted it to be. And getting vacations for kids is great, how is that bad?", "YTA The reason she didn't give you access is because they are right you have no right to the money, she paid off your debt also she could have turned around and said nope I will pay my stuff and you can pay what you owe.", "INFO:  How do you normally split finances?", "YTA.

Cause it's her money not his, and therefore it's also his money and not hers right?\n\nI find this whole separation of finance between husband and wife quite nonsense actually.

You're already back in debt because of her. And she's the one who put you in debt in the first place.

YTA \n\nIt's her money not yours. Go away.", "This one is a hard one because I can understand both sides. On one hand, she is right, her dad left her the money and she should get to decide what to do with it. She also did help pay off debts and set you guys up for the next year with rent being paid. On the other hand, I definitely understand your side too. It\u2019s extremely irresponsible to spend almost 100K so quickly (although the vacation for next summer was nice). Although I don\u2019t think you should have access to the account, I do think check-ins about the amount left would have been appropriate since you mentioned she has/had a spending issue. I would say NTA because you have every right to be upset that she spent so much when she should have saved (or invested) at least a little bit of the money that was left.", "YTA. You have no say in how she spends \u2018her\u2019 money. I get the impression you\u2019re a bit of a control freak.", "YTA. Not your money.

Your wife is an idiot for spending it but you had no right to control it.", "NTA having read the other comments by OP - but OP hasn\u2019t phrased it very well. \u201cMonitor\u201d is not a good word in this situation.", "Start saving what you would have spent in rent more if you can. No meals out, no holidays until you can have your safety net. No access for wife to it.", "YTA This money was a windfall, and it sounds like you benefitted from it. While I think she was stupid to spend that much money that quickly, it's really not your business to monitor her spending. If this was her paycheck, I'd think differently, but this is not money you ever planned to have.", "NAH. Is your money separated and not in a joint account? Do you give her access to your own money? Because if so, then having her spend tens of thousands of your own money whilst restricting her own with no input from you would be unfair.", "NTA.  For any sudden windfall, especially one that is 100K or more...\n\nThat money should be invested.  There are very safe mutual funds that pay 15% a year, and that money is fully insured by the government.  To invest costs nothing, as all you need to do is open a free online brokerage account with etrade or schwab or whatever, and link a bank account to it to transfer funds.  \n\nLet's put this in perspective.  If she'd invested 200K, that would provide 30K of income for your family.  Let's say she sets up automatic withdrawals of 500 a week.  That means you have passive income of $500 a week AND your brokerage account still grows by $4K a year.  Not bad.  Could your family use an extra $500 a week?\n\nNow let's look at what she did.  Paid off debt.  That's a good idea if the debt is charging more than 15% a year, such as credit card debt.  Otherwise, it's better to invest the money and use dividends to pay down debt.  Paid off cars, registration, insurance.  Bad idea.  I doubt the car loans were charging more than 15% per year, so she's throwing money away (that money could have been earning 15% a year).  I don't think registration and car insurance can be financed.  So that money is a total loss.  Same with rent.  Paying it a year in advance is causing you to lose money, as that money is not earning interest for you.  \n\nGiving 15K to mom, booking multiple vacations, eating out a lot.  All money wasted.  For just one example, the properly invested money could have given you passive income of $500 a week.  Not that it's a good idea to eat out a lot.  But $500 a week of passive income would allow you to eat out often, essentially for free.  (because you are not working to cover the cost of eating out)\n\nAll this is moot, as the money is gone now.  But if you ever get a serious windfall again, it might be prudent to take charge and make sure that money is properly invested.", "YTA\n\nFirst, what makes you think you are entitled to her money? Second, what makes you think you can judge her spending habits when it doesn't affect you?", "You\u2019re a gigantic AH. You loved that she got that money cause you did think you were entitled to it. Monitor the spending? Even her mum knew you were overstepping when you brought it up. \n\nIt\u2019s her money, her first priority was to clear debt and ensure you guys have a roof over your head for the next year. Then she moved on to spoiling the family with holidays etc, you\u2019re acting as if she spent it all on herself! \n\nGet off your high horse thinking you would have managed the money better, it wasn\u2019t yours to begin with.", "ESH - she doesn't seem that bad if she used half to clear debt and to pay off rent for a year - you breeze through that bit like it's nothing. You benefit from that too. \nHowever, blowing through 100k is not great.\nHave you and your wife considered therapy? If she's done this in the past, she may have some issues with compulsive shopping. Buying and spending may be a way for her to satisfy a good or need.\nEither way you both suck in this instance because she needs to get control of her spending and you need to remember that she threw down half her inheritance on stuff you benefit from as well.", "Eh... very soft YTA?  \n\n\nI mean, yes, I can completely see why you're angry and upset, I would be too.  Spending \u00a3100K in one year with no way to replace it - spending thousands of dollars on holidays when you have student loan debt - is really, really incredibly stupid and just the idea makes me twitchy and angry as hell.  \n\nBut at the same time, your wife is correct to say this is money she inherited from her father and she, and only she, got to decide how to spend it. And now she's spent it. \n\nThe money has gone, no getting it back: there is no point getting angry about that. She has blown everything she inherited from her dad in one year of overspending, and now you need to move on on the basis that effectively, she's in the same state she would have been if her dad had cut her off without a penny. So you're actually no worse off than you would have been if that had happened.", "Going against the grain here, but NTA. You're married. You should have input. \n\nI also don't think your wife knows what \"blood money\" is. Insurance money is designed to take care of your loved ones after you die. Blood money is what a mercenary gets after he \"takes care of\" other people.

Controlling and manipulative", "YTA you said it yourself it HER money and you wanted to control it!", "NTA", "NTA you're a couple and all of it should go to help the family. That doesn't mean she shouldn't spend some of it on fun things for herself but this idea that you should have no say over her financial recklessness doesn't speak to true couplehood.", "YTA. You have no right to HER money so you can monitor it. That just sounds stupid. It\u2019s her money if she wants go spend it stupidly that\u2019s her choice.", "YTA\n\nShe did have to pay off all the debt; but she did.\n\nInheritance is not community property.   You don't get to \"monitor her spending\" money that you have zero right to.\n\nShe set the family up for the next YEAR!!", "YTA. Your wife\u2019s inheritance was hers not yours. She used $100k to pay joint bills. You have no claim to any of it. And holy patronizing, monitoring your wife\u2019s spending of her own money?!?", "NTA\n\nI really do jot understand all the Y T A comments and i sure do not understand the double standards.\nWhy is it okay for her spend the money he makes, why is it okay for him to provide for the family and the house and to share his money but you all act like she did an amazing thing cause she paid some of the expences? She paid loans, rent etc as she should have done for her family and then she WASTED 100k and you all seem to have no problem with that, she could have spend some and invest or save the rest for her Child/children. And i am pretty sure that if OP cuts her access to his accounts and start spendind the money here and there she sure as hello wont be happy.", "Instead of \u201cmonitoring\u201d the expenses, you could\u2019ve come up with some idea of investing, that is, of course, if she agreed, because it was her money, after all. She did pay the debt and the rent and cars expenses, and you also benefited a lot from that money, and it sounds like that was a lot spent on you too. Therefore, get your sorry ass and apologise for your selfish and entitled attitude and then get your ass to work, make money and contribute to your family\u2019s life as she did.

You\u2019re not entitled to any of that money. If your father-in-law wanted to give any of it to you, he would\u2019ve done so in the will. \n\nStop trying to rationalize her poor choices.

If her spending is an issue then deal with that but that money wasn\u2019t yours. You do sound a bit controlling.", "Well, my ex blew through 500k in less than 4 yrs of her inheritance.  The fact is that unless she can control herself with spending without inheritance, she has a problem already.  The excuses are just a cover for a deeper issue here.  You can not control a grown adult like a father. She's your wife, and she is equal in house.  My ex had aunts who spoiled her growing up, and  after everything was said and done, she literally lost everything i stopped paying for as she told me she could manage money better than me.\n I am the only man she's married she didn't file for bankruptcy cause i didn't mix our finances or let her apply for anything under my name.\nManage your life and separate your finances now while you can.  Best of luck. She needs therapy.", "I guess based on these comments I\u2019m going against the grain. If I inherited money from my father\u2019s death, that becomes OUR money for OUR family. It\u2019s very odd to me to see so many comment on such a hard divide of his/her money for a married couple. Her father was also your family too. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re just dating. You\u2019re supposed to be a team. Overall, I\u2019d say ESH because it\u2019s both of your faults for not being on the same page for something as important as finances and difficult situations.

A plan could have been made that was best for your family's future & security, and that still put aside a chunk of money for some unmonitored retail therapy.", "NTA with all of the extra info you give in comments.\n\nShe has put y'all in debt multiple times, you had to take out money from your 401k, and she has student loans still!

This is why about 50% of divorces list money squabbles as a major contributing factor to the break-down of the marriage.  If a wife takes the stance that \"this is MY money, not yours\", she may feel entitled to do so.  But that's the attitude of a single woman, not one who should be married.  Because she just doesn't get it that the family's prosperity (including her hubby's) is what she signed up to protect and promote.  \n\nWhat makes this shit particularly irritating are divorce courts, in the U.S. in particular.  If she files for divorce, she can take half his assets quite easily.  So she gets 200K in inheritance, spends it the way she wants to.  Then later she files for divorce and takes half HIS money, as well.   \n\nYou write that she spent the money building memories with her family and kids, and those memories are valuable.  OK.  She still f\\*cked up.\n\nGoogle qqq  (stock ticker).  Note how it's up like 35% in the past year.  That isn't normal, but normally it does perform quite well anyway.  So let's say 200K invested in a very safe mutual fund.  $70K passive income last year.  Historically, it would be closer to $30K.  But let's assume it pays somewhere between $30K and $70K a year.\n\nThat's $30K to $70K a year in passive income in a very safe investment.  It's not rocket science, and it's not even an advanced investing strategy.  It's literally just buying an index fund...one of the easiest and safest ways that ANYONE can invest.  None of this is investing advice, by the way.   Just making a point.\n\nSo you easily get $30-$70K a year of passive income from wisely investing $200K from inheritance.  \n\nDo you think it would be possible to use that $30-70K of passive income per year, building memories with family and kids?\n\nOP's wife chose a year of building memories with family and kids over a lifetime of building memories with family and kids.", "Yeah, if I had a 9-month reprieve of my rent, I'd be thrilled as it's a big expense not to worry about.\nStill, I don't know your wife, but from your post, it does sound like she needs some help.
