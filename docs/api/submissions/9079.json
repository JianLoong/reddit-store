Beer is not the same thing as something that everyone, kids included, can enjoy, like soda.", "NTA.  You obviously don't need\\* beer at a child birthday party.

When you throw a party at your house, you get to decide what is served.  Also, the notion that you need alcohol at an 11 y.o.'s birthday is absurd.  It's a kid's party.  The adults  can surely live with other beverages for a couple hours while supervising children. I say, ignore your ex and serve what you want.  And buy the soda.  Obviously your ex should split the cost and is picking a stupid fight; don't rise to the bait.  Soda is cheap.", "NTA.

It's not worth the drama.", "NTA, we have to normalize adults not drinking so that it's not such a horrifying thought. Let her be petty and pay for the sodas yourself if you can afford it, but don't go or do anything you aren't comfortable with just because of societal expectations.", "Nta and I see why she\u2019s an ex. \nSo proud of you for staying sober. You are changing the trajectory for you and your son\u2019s life.", "NTA op said in a comment that the kid is eleven. Alcohol at a kids birthday party is 50/50 and I don't think it's to be assumed either way whether alcohol should be available for adults. I doubt anyone would blink if it weren't available. She's being TA and being snide about snide with the soda comment but eff it, spend an extra $7 and move on without alcohol.", "NTA there is no need for beer at an 11 year old's party. And way to go in the sobriety!!!", "NTA, if they wanna drink they can go elsewhere and buy it themselves", "Why is there beer at a kids party anyway? Cant the adults not refrain for a few hours and out of respect you should have a no alcohol rule in your home - its not just about buying it - just say its an alcohol free home now. It has no impact on your son or his friends enjoyment.", "NTA.\n\nYour son and his friends won\u2019t be drinking, as they\u2019re children, so there is no reason for anyone to expect alcohol at the party. I wouldn\u2019t make this the hill you die on, though. Just pay for the soda and let your ex be as petty as she wants.", "NTA. You are inno way ever obligated to buy drugs for people. Alcohol is a drug.", "NTA. Congrats on your sobriety. You don't need beer at a children's party, and hopefully your guests can respect that you keep a booze-free house.", "NTA. It\u2019s a kid\u2019s birthday party. It\u2019s weird if anyone feels there should be beer there.

Pay for the soda, but tell your ex that alcohol is not welcome at your house, no matter who buys it", "NTA. She\u2019s intentionally being a problem. What does your son drink?  Probably the soda.

What a garbage person to prioritize beer for friends at a kid\u2019s birthday party over your sobriety.", "NTA don\u2019t take the bait!", "NTA. The simple thing to do would be to ignore the comment entirely and just send her the amount of the entire portion of her half. \n\nBut the more assertive side of me would tell her to grow up and stop acting more immature than your son. This party isn\u2019t about her or the other drinking age adults at the party. It\u2019s about your son and there is no reason to have alcohol present at a child\u2019s birthday party. and that you have every right to not allow alcohol in your home when you recently quit drinking and you don\u2019t want it in your home.", "As someone in recovery as well, you don\u2019t have to allow alcohol in your home at all (especially since you\u2019re still very early in recovery).

Even if you did welcome alcohol in your home,  it is not necessary for an 11 year old's birthday party and if the other parents think it's a hardship not to drink for a few hours,  maybe they should take an honest look at their relationship with the bottle. \n\nI would not want to be responsible for parents drinking for a couple of hours and then putting their children in their cars & driving after the party.", "NTA. Even asking to have beer at the party made her an AH. Double for expecting you to pick it up. Triple for expecting you to pay for it. Quadruple for the childish response about soda", "NTA. Just ignore you ex's BS.", "NTA sounds like she is trying to set you up to relapse, I bet she\u2019d leave the extra beers at your house after the party too. Or at the very least, she\u2019s minimizing what an accomplishment becoming sober is.", "Well it's a good thing they're an ex because she's not supportive of your recovery at all. \n\nNTA\n\nYou don't bring alcohol to a sober house.", "NTA and I wouldn't be allowing any beer in the house either. If the adults are mature they should be able to go for a few hours without alcohol.", "NTA.\n\nThrow the logic back at her. \"Well I don't drink beer so I'm not paying for anyone to drink beer.\" \n\nIt's your house, it's your right to serve or not serve.

She wants you to buy the beer but don't want to pay 1/2 for the soda since she doesn't drink it and doesn't want to pay for anyone else to drink it either?
