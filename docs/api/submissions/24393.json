They played music until 3am, screamed at you when you did the neighborly thing and talked to them instead of getting the town involved, then did it AGAIN. They just moved in and are planning a minimum of three parties. Set the standard of what\u2019s acceptable in your area now even if it leads to one less friend in the neighborhood.", "NTA. Music until 3am on Wednesday is completely ridiculous and it was totally predictable that someone would call bylaw enforcement on them. They did this to themselves.", "NTA\n\nIt wasn't your intention to ruin their wedding or get it cancelled. You attempted to resolve it peacefully, without any law enforcement, and they were not willing to compromise.", "NTA\n\nBut where do you live that the government is interested in the kind of party?", "NTA - It's up to them to research the laws where they live, not you.", "Seems like your new neighbors don\u2019t like to follow the rules so they essentially just screwed themselves.... NTA", "NTA. You know, if they had been nice to you when you ask them to turn the music down, they wouldn't have be looking for a new venue. They don't like the bylaws? They can go back to Serbia, see how fun it is to be living there. I don't understand people who think just because they're having an event they can annoy the crap out of neighbors for days,\n\n I had neighbors who would have parties every Friday and Saturday, screaming until 2 or 3 in the morning. I had to start calling the cops on them. First at 3, then 2, then 1, then midnight until they moved the screaming to the front yard and annoyed those neighbors.  We all loved when they finally were foreclosed on (big surprise, huh) and moved out.", "NTA. Good luck with the new neighbours.", "NTA - but good luck living next to them. \n\nMusic on until 3am after you asked to turn it down, and they yelled at you?! AND did it again? Nope, youre good. \n\nAlso, share the footage!! (Not in this sub, thatll get the post deleted but find another sub for it!)", "NTA- they were breaking the rules and being disrespectful neighbors.

The footage will stay with me for now.  I have other footage of some of their guests harassing me the following day.  Hope the police doesn\u2019t have to get involved someday,  just covering my ads just in case.", "So a wedding party needs a permit, but a party after a wedding not?", "I see where you are going!"]}
