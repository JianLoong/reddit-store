That's how I'm understanding it.", "Again, \"they all\" is a continuation of my previous statement of those I'd met.  I do think most Serbians hate us though, but not all.  The one thing I appreciate about Serbs, and people from the Balkans (also, Turks), is they don't hide their racism and hatred like Americans do. They put it right out there, right in your face, so they know where you stand.  \n\nSerbs are always clear about their hatred of Americans when I interact with them. The moment a Serb finds out you're American, it goes into a snyde comment about how we were evil for intervening in the Bosnian genocide, and usually devolves from there. \n\n  \n\n\nI guess my writing style is unclear there, I tend to throw 2 sentences together.  The general assumption is that North Koreans hate Americans as much as russians do, and they express their hatred however they can. You would actually be surprised the level of social networking activity which comes out of NK.  Most of it is limited to VK and Yandex, but also significantly Telegram, but I promise you, the hatred is there.", "NTA.
