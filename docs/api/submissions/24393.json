They played music until 3am, screamed at you when you did the neighborly thing and talked to them instead of getting the town involved, then did it AGAIN. They just moved in and are planning a minimum of three parties. Set the standard of what\u2019s acceptable in your area now even if it leads to one less friend in the neighborhood.", "NTA. Music until 3am on Wednesday is completely ridiculous and it was totally predictable that someone would call bylaw enforcement on them. They did this to themselves.", "NTA\n\nIt wasn't your intention to ruin their wedding or get it cancelled. You attempted to resolve it peacefully, without any law enforcement, and they were not willing to compromise.", "NTA\n\nBut where do you live that the government is interested in the kind of party?", "NTA - It's up to them to research the laws where they live, not you.", "Seems like your new neighbors don\u2019t like to follow the rules so they essentially just screwed themselves.... NTA", "NTA. You know, if they had been nice to you when you ask them to turn the music down, they wouldn't have be looking for a new venue. They don't like the bylaws? They can go back to Serbia, see how fun it is to be living there. I don't understand people who think just because they're having an event they can annoy the crap out of neighbors for days,\n\n I had neighbors who would have parties every Friday and Saturday, screaming until 2 or 3 in the morning. I had to start calling the cops on them. First at 3, then 2, then 1, then midnight until they moved the screaming to the front yard and annoyed those neighbors.  We all loved when they finally were foreclosed on (big surprise, huh) and moved out.", "NTA. Good luck with the new neighbours.", "NTA - but good luck living next to them. \n\nMusic on until 3am after you asked to turn it down, and they yelled at you?! AND did it again? Nope, youre good. \n\nAlso, share the footage!! (Not in this sub, thatll get the post deleted but find another sub for it!)", "NTA- they were breaking the rules and being disrespectful neighbors.

The footage will stay with me for now.  I have other footage of some of their guests harassing me the following day.  Hope the police doesn\u2019t have to get involved someday,  just covering my ads just in case.", "So a wedding party needs a permit, but a party after a wedding not?", "I see where you are going!", "NTA.  The neighbors from hell were served right.", "NTA. You did not ruin their wedding. They fucked things up all by themselves.", "NTA. you had no idea a permit was needed for a backyard wedding, and even if you did, you had no idea if they had one or not. Not your problem. It's theirs.", "NTA. My parents always taught me to make nice with our neighbors because you *want to get along with people who can make your life a living hell*.

I did not know this was a thing.", "NTA they were not good neighbors and you only asked for a noise complaint. you didn't know the wedding rule so it was fate that went on them. odds are the HOA's will be keeping an eye on them.", "NTA You didn't even know it would impact their wedding. They should not have been behaving like that in a neighborhood. You even tried to ask nicely.", "If you're an asshole, then I am too because I find it insanely funny that their actions blew up in their faces. Cosmic Justice makes for the best stories. Enjoy your peaceful Sunday!", "NTA. It sounds like you were patient and not just rubbing the rules in their faces. Whether your neighbourhood is 'quiet' or not is irrelevant, nobody needs to be partying in a residential area until 3am to the point where others can't sleep.\n\nI have to say that needing a permit to have a wedding in your own backyard is messed up. But we end up with rules like this because people won't control themselves. They should have just pulled their heads in and then they would have been able to have the wedding. Good luck with them in the future...", "NTA. It\u2019s called F*ck Around and Find Out. Serves them right tbh.", "NTA", "NTA. F%ck them and their wedding. Ways of doing things event wise and this way isnt it.", "Should post this at r/Pettyrevenge", "NTA.\n\nOthers have already said it: they were unacceptably loud for a long amount of time, you tried to resolve it in a neighborly manner without involving anyone else, and they doubled down.\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong here.  They did.  As a result, they've reached the Find Out phase of Fucking Around.", "you just went home after they screamed at you? I'd have waited maybe 1/2and called the police. they've already shown what sort of neighbors they're going to be.", "Oh man I feel bad for you. Move. I have traveled every country in Europe extensively in the only people I\u2019ve ever been jerks to me are Serbians. They\u2019re just assholes towards americans. They think that we owe them something because we stop them from committing genocide in Kosovo.\n\nI study music and Serbia in Bulgaria in Macedonia every single Balkan country, and the only country I would never go back to is serbia. Really I\u2019ve never had a pleasant experience with a serbian in America, or in Europe. It\u2019s not just because I\u2019m American. I always lie and tell him I\u2019m Canadian, and they are still assholes.", "Okay you had bad experiences \n\nBut maybe lets not say an entire country are AHs?", "It is the alcohol. I am guessing OP is in the same province as me and for an indoor party you don't need an alcohol permit but for an outdoor party you do.", "Please quote the part of my comment where I said this?", "Im in the US and its the same in my city, I mean people dont follow the law but are also respectful of neighbors so no problems. We have to get a 1 day permit for outdoor events where there will be alcohol doesnt matter if its a wedding or just a large party its the alcohol that changes things.", ">They\u2019re just assholes towards americans", "\\> I have traveled every country in Europe extensively in the only people I\u2019ve ever been jerks to me are Serbians.\n\nContext matters.  \n\nAre you Serb or have extensive experience? I know hundreds of them from my music scene in America. The nicest thing I can say is that they are usually great musicians. The most honest thing I can say is the ones I know, or see commenting online are easily more anti-American than russians or north koreans.", "Im not invalidating your experience but you may want to rethink this. You dont know all Serbians, so saying they all hate Americans just aint cool. \n\nAlso where are you seeing north korenas commenting online, cause? What?", "Never did this person say ALL. \"They\" in this context means the ones they have had experiences with.  That's how I'm understanding it.", "Again, \"they all\" is a continuation of my previous statement of those I'd met.  I do think most Serbians hate us though, but not all.  The one thing I appreciate about Serbs, and people from the Balkans (also, Turks), is they don't hide their racism and hatred like Americans do. They put it right out there, right in your face, so they know where you stand.  \n\nSerbs are always clear about their hatred of Americans when I interact with them. The moment a Serb finds out you're American, it goes into a snyde comment about how we were evil for intervening in the Bosnian genocide, and usually devolves from there. \n\n  \n\n\nI guess my writing style is unclear there, I tend to throw 2 sentences together.  The general assumption is that North Koreans hate Americans as much as russians do, and they express their hatred however they can. You would actually be surprised the level of social networking activity which comes out of NK.  Most of it is limited to VK and Yandex, but also significantly Telegram, but I promise you, the hatred is there.", "NTA. I think its common sense to not play extremely loud music at 3 am in your backyard. Even without bylaw, its just rude to play so loudly. Hopefully they have learned their lesson", "NTA - Permit needed, they didn't didn't get one so oh well, their circus, their monkey.", "NTA but based on the title I was hoping for you blasting music or porn during the ceremony. Good luck with your new neighbors", "HOAs have rules.  New owners should have read the rules.  It is their responsibility.\n\nHaving a party, in the middle of the week, that continues past a reasonable time (10:00 or 11:00 pm) is obnoxious.  I am sure you were not the only one annoyed by the noise.\n\nThe neighbors violated the rules.  If they had shut down the party on that Wednesday, and respected the HOA noise rules, you wouldn't have reported them.\n\nThey played stupid games and won the stupid prize.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I get away with a surprising amount. Part of that is because I look like a 35 year old queer Mrs clause. However most of it is because when I do things that are against the rules I go out of my way to make sure no one else is inconvenienced. \n\nYou can ignore rules, you can be an inconsiderate person, can't really do both though.", "NTA but seems disingenuous to say you weren\u2019t trying to fuck over the wedding. Just own it", "NTA at all.\n\nBut I would have let them have the wedding and then mow your lawn VERY slowly while blasting music right next to the fence as soon as it began.", "You are NTA and never ta for people having to abide by the rules.", "NTA - is not like you were trying to have their wedding cancelled l, you just wanted decent sound levels on a weeknight.", "NTA. You wouldn't have had to call Bylaw if they had been considerate neighbors. Unintended consequences happen sometimes.", "NTA, actions on their part had consequences...", "NTA - They had it coming.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA. A beautiful consequence.", "Karma hit them hard! NTA.", "Nope, NTA at all.", "NTA. Got to be respectful to others. They weren\u2019t and deserve everything they got.", "Fuck around find out NTA", "NTA they fucked around and found out", "NTA, they fucked around and found out. Be prepared for many many more 3am parties though. Nothing nice about those neighbours.", "NTA but you know with people like this as neighbors that you just declared war, right? I would have waited until the wedding was being seated and made sure I had a lot of people over and start playing music and cooking on onions on the grill and maybe a few firecrackers.", "Assholes getting legal just desserts is never TA", "NTA. Had they been more considerate neighbors, the wedding would not have been impacted. But they decided to FA, so now they get to FO. Yelling at people asking you to let them sleep during the work week is a pretty AH move.", "YTA - You're the Herbicide of Love, but at least now they have a heartfelt story to tell!", "NTA\n\nThey FAFO... but you just created a whole shit load of future issues with them now.\n\nBe prepared!", "*They don't like the bylaws? They can go back to Serbia, see how fun it is to be living there.*\n\nThere's absolutely no need to trot out the \"go back to where u come from\" garbage.   This shit happens with families of all varieties", "Honestly, get the police involved early because otherwise they might try to use the police against you in some way.\n\nJust think about how much sleep you will get when they are forced to move.", "You might want to nip this in the bud early. You already have several incidents in a short period. Even if you don't press charges you might want to make a police report and give them copies of your footage. You never know what it could escalate to.", "I would suggest r/publicfreakout as that sub is meant for videos about public misbehavior. \n\nAnd OP is NTA. Neighbors are in the find out phase of life.", "I love how you say this as if it\u2019s negative\u2026 but you\u2019re literally benefitting from the existence of these laws. They\u2019re there to protect your peace.", "> Oh man I feel bad for you. Move.\n\nDoesn\u2019t it depend where OP is? Assuming that OP is **not** in Serbia, then I think moving is the last thing OP should do. Far better to stand their ground and, if necessary, make it a full-time mission to help their new neighbors learn the importance of respecting local customs and laws. Some people would even enjoy this! Natural ambassadors, you might call them. :)", "Chill with the racist generalizations.", "Do wedding venues not need to be licensed/permitted these days? They do in the UK.", "Well said.  We all like to harp on governments but once and while their policies and laws help you out.    Unfortunately in this instance my noise complaint had very unintended consequences.", "What did you think it would be? The mounties show up and politely ask everyone to go inside because it's dark and they're scared??", "\"Really I\u2019ve never had a pleasant experience with a serbian in America, or in Europe.\"\n\nWill that do?\n\nEdit: especially given that your comment is telling OP to move because their neighbours are Serbisns, ie you're judging Serbians you haven't met.", "I'm from Balkans and you will hardly find anyone to say that Serbians are the nicest", "I've found that Makedonjians are the nicest peeps from the Balkans. I've overall had the best experiences with them, and there. Polar opposite, Serbs will single me out and try to pick an argument. Makedonjians will leave me alone unless I seem to express interest in talking, then they're just happy to talk and share experiences and stories.", "They're strongly implying ALL, given that they jump straight to saying OP should move *because* the neighbours are Serbian - even though by definition they are not among the Serbians with whom GainAffectionate has interacted.", "No, that's not how English works. JRM's read is correct."]}
