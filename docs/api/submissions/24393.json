They put it right out there, right in your face, so they know where you stand.  \n\nSerbs are always clear about their hatred of Americans when I interact with them. The moment a Serb finds out you're American, it goes into a snyde comment about how we were evil for intervening in the Bosnian genocide, and usually devolves from there. \n\n  \n\n\nI guess my writing style is unclear there, I tend to throw 2 sentences together.  The general assumption is that North Koreans hate Americans as much as russians do, and they express their hatred however they can.

Most of it is limited to VK and Yandex, but also significantly Telegram, but I promise you, the hatred is there.", "NTA.

Plus, they disrespected your children not being able to sleep. You didn\u2019t have intentions of messing with the wedding, and it\u2019s not really your fault that what they were doing just so happened to be illegal.", "NTA. If you\u2019re gonna break the law (or whatever not having a permit is), it\u2019s best to not be an asshole.

That explains the 3-day party.\n\nI'm half-Serbian (half-Scottish).  The 3-day wedding was the norm in the old days, I believe. Actual Serbian residents no longer do that, I believe - just a 'normal' one-day wedding, same as many other places.\n\nI wasn't brought up speaking the language, but I'll bet that I know some of the phrases that were used. My dad's favourite non-sweary word for a not-terribly nice person was 'd\u017eukela' - 'yard-dog, mutt'.\n\nIf you want to hear a few choicer Serbian phrases, look for 'Serbian Lesson Guy' on Youtube - he's an American with Serbian parents.\n\nSorry that you had to put up with all this. NTA  \n\n\nETA I've seen elsewhere that you're in Canada. Some of the diaspora in Canada pull the 'more Serbian than actual Serbs' routine - pretty much like some of the Scots in Canada. That explains the party. They think they're back in grandad's village where a big party isn't going to inconvenience anyone.   \n\n\nAs I've said in a comment to someone else here, they're not \\*that\\* hard, honestly  and a decent Serb wouldn't behave like that.    \n\n\nAlso, I can tell you that most Serbs just wouldn't tangle with the authorities.

He married out there. Unfortunately, died young.   \n\n\nMy aunt was left widowed with three children. Started to have difficulty with a snide Serbian neighbour making comments about the state of her yard, etc.  \n\n\nApparently, my dad wrote to them (from Scotland) and told them that they'd be better off being good neighbours and should help instead of being asshats.

I had a Sunday backyard wedding in a quiet residential neighborhood that my in-laws had just moved to, so no one had met any neighbors yet. Anticipating *exactly* this issue I got a permit from the town for both the tent and the event, planned the entire day\u2019s schedule so the party would wrap no later than 10pm, and I went around to every house within earshot the day before the wedding, introducing myself and our family and dropping off gift bags filled with wine, chocolate and a note with our wedding planner\u2019s phone number in case the music was too loud or someone parked stupidly on the street or whatever. We had not a single complaint and got like three wedding gifts dropped off at the house the next week from neighbors who were complete strangers.

I pretty much guarantee their children\u2019s children will hate your family", "NTA, they fucked themselves over being cheap and rude. They could\u2019ve held it in a park. It\u2019s ridiculous of them to expect their neighbors to just lose sleep and their children over a noise disturbance. Unfortunately it sounds like OPs in it for the long run with them. There was no avoiding getting off to a bad foot here though. If they think this is acceptable, and acted that way, they\u2019ll do it again and again. \n\nI would definitely keep the ring doorbell acitivated and probably set it to save video footage to a hard drive or something like it. And I would start talking to their other neighbors. The more people that are mad and file noise complaints the more likely they might turn around and leave. Hopefully they are renting but it doesn\u2019t sound like it.\n\nBuying a house doesn\u2019t give you the rights to disturb a neighborhood.", "NTA, and on top of everything else people are saying, the rest of the neighborhood probably hates them too, and now your neighbors know you aren't fucking around.", "NTA. This is on them.", "NTA: I mean, I get it's a wedding, but like they didn't have a permit. Even though they probably didn't know, it's kinda weird on why they didint do it somehwere else.
