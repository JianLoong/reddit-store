My sister wanted to go up to our rooms with myself (Maid of Honour) and her 3 other bridesmaids around 9.30pm to chill before the wedding day. \nI didn\u2019t want to go up to the room as I wanted a hot chocolate and to keep talking with family. \n\nMy sister was upset and told me I was \u2018taking the piss\u2019 as I was her maid of honour and should want to spend my time at her wedding with her and bridesmaids. As I\u2019ll never see her other bridesmaids again I didn\u2019t care enough to do this. \n\nSister leaves the meal and goes upstairs, and I follow an hour later. When I get upstairs, she is crying saying i am selfish I have not prioritised her and as her MOH I should have done what she wanted for one night. I told her that her reaction was ridiculous and she was being overdramatic, and being a bridesmaid doesn\u2019t mean I have to do what she says. This made things worse. She was heavily crying. \n\nI was due to stay in the room with her that night but I told her if she was this upset that wasn\u2019t a good idea and I would stay with my husband in his room. This also upset her as she stayed in my room before my wedding when she was my MOH and she wanted to have the same memory. I told her to calm down and that she should put it to the side the next day to avoid any awkwardness. \n\nThe morning of the wedding came- I hadn\u2019t slept all night as she had stressed me out so much (I\u2019m also pregnant). Sister had calmed down the morning of the wedding but I was so furious I couldn\u2019t look at her or speak to her. The whole day I had to ignore her. \n\nSince she has told me how devastated she is that I would ruin her day like this, but I\u2019ve told her she stressed me out too much that I was worried I would miscarry because of her. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1700347665, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17yiawa/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She refused. This upset me as her reasons were she didn\u2019t want to spend time with me and my other bridesmaids, as they\u2019re \u2018strangers she won\u2019t ever see again\u2019 and she\u2019d rather be with our other family members. When I voiced my frustration she called me dramatic and said just because she was my bridesmaid doesn\u2019t mean I can order her around.\n\nThe day of the actual wedding she refused to speak to me other than to tell me she didn\u2019t want to be there and wanted to go home. My photos and wedding video are ruined because she has a face on her.\n\nSince the wedding, she has told me she hated my wedding day, it was all my fault for getting upset in the first place and the only reason she stayed at my wedding was to \u2018not prove my point that she was a bad bridesmaid\u2019. She also told me that the stress of the argument made her feel she would miscarry her pregnancy.\n\nI\u2019m really struggling to move past this as she has ruined the most important day of my life and the memories of it.

She refused. This upset me as her reasons were she didn\u2019t want to spend time with me and my other bridesmaids, as they\u2019re \u2018strangers she won\u2019t ever see again\u2019 and she\u2019d rather be with our other family members. When I voiced my frustration she called me dramatic and said just because she was my bridesmaid doesn\u2019t mean I can order her around.\n\nThe day of the actual wedding she refused to speak to me other than to tell me she didn\u2019t want to be there and wanted to go home. My photos and wedding video are ruined because she has a face on her.\n\nSince the wedding, she has told me she hated my wedding day, it was all my fault for getting upset in the first place and the only reason she stayed at my wedding was to \u2018not prove my point that she was a bad bridesmaid\u2019. She also told me that the stress of the argument made her feel she would miscarry her pregnancy.\n\nI\u2019m really struggling to move past this as she has ruined the most important day of my life and the memories of it.
