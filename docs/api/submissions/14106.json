I get that that's very unusual, but it's just worked out like that. We took a few breaks in high school just to make sure we weren't codendent or anything like that, but we still wanted to be together. We still love eachother very much, and we've both felt that get stronger as we grew up, and we both plan to stay together.\n\nThe thing is that my family still sees us as some middle school fake relationship. I get feeling that way in the beginning, because as much as it annoyed me at the time that's what we were. I was calling her my girlfriend and vice versa for like two months before we even held hands. I don't blame them for not taking it seriously back then.\n\nThe thing is that my parents in particular seem like they're just waiting for us to break up. They won't even call her by her name, she's just \"My 'girlfriend'\" and they say it sarcastically. TBF, my girlfriends dad calls me her \"little boyfriend\" still, but at least he likes me. I can tell it hurts her to be disregarded like that. And I'm sick of it.\n\nThe other day I was going to pick her up, and my mother was trying to get me to cancel it, for no other reason than \"Don't you get sick of spending all your time with her?\" And I told no, I don't, she's my partner and I love her. If she doesn't like that, I'll move out and neither of us will have to bother the family again.\n\nNow my father is pissed at me for disrespecting my mother, and says I have a month to get out. That's fine, we were planning on moving into a place together anyway, even if it will be dumpy. My dad tried to have a heart to heart about it, and says I'm throwing my life away over \"some fling\". Honestly if they feel that way they're welcome to fuck off out of my life,but my siblings think I'm wrong to resent them over this.", "created_utc": 1680754347, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12d8np5/aita_for_telling_my_family_to_stop_treating_my/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think it's hard for parents to see their kid's relationships as adult relationships and until a certain point, they're just playing house and it's hard for them to accept otherwise.", "NTA.
