Your words were harsh but they sound like they are spot on and, wording aside, your point was to acknowledge her growth but also point out that it's not ok to claim victimhood after the fact if it keeps you from actually taking responsibility for your actions. It sounds like she has made some strides but if this turns into 'I was actually the victim' then her progress and therapy have gone sideways and it'll become toxic again. You were right to point that out and make sure she knows you have your own memory of how this went down. \n\nIt's complex because she may legitimately have gotten the short end of the stick at times, like assumptions that she'd done something bad when she hadn't, due to the track record of bad things she'd done. She'd be best served to let it all go, rather than try to untangle the web of when she was 'wronged'. I hope she gets over it and continues her growth but I don't think you were an AH for what you said.", "NTA\n\nShe's feeding her therapist a story that fits the narrative in her mind, I would stay low or NC until she can admit her part in how all your younger years played out.", "NTA, but it sounds like you could also benefit from therapy.

Only you know everything she's done to you, but it doesn't seem like ordinary sisterly bs. It sounds like abuse. \n\nThe Y TA comments are ignoring that OP was also abused.

This isn't to dismiss what your saying but acknowledging that she likely needs more time in therapy to truly understand what she has done and the dynamic she created in the house hold. A personal example is according to my sister I was the \"golden child\" and was given everything, what she conveniently forgets is that I could have nothing until she had it and was responsible with it. So this became I couldn't have a cell phone until she stopped losing her (she lost about 5), and I couldn't have a car until she stopped crashing her (she totaled 3) bit all this was forgotten because all she remembered was the consequences and the punishments not the actions that led to them.

And she also loves to use therapy talk, and genuinely believes she was the wronged party.

Im also sure a therapist wouldnt put labels on a family eg golden child especially when shes not family therapist and doesnt know them. But rspecially being older we dont know that her bad behaviour was caused by isolation not the other way round. Likely to be a bit of both. The op doesnt know either and rsther than hearing her sidtrts side, she disregatded her feelings as non valid and lsughed in her face", "Sounds like there\u2019s zero understanding of the manipulation from the parent, and no empathy for the sister. I come from a family like this. People like OP end up being narcissistic too, because there\u2019s so much cognitive dissonance and excuse-making. Like I don\u2019t think the penny has fully dropped because why is the other sister no contact with everyone? What was the raging sister\u2019s life like before the younger two were born. There is valid context there", "So was Jen, that\u2019s the issue here. The whole family was abused by their parents and pitted against each other. That\u2019s how this family dynamics flourishes, the parents pit the kids against each other so they can never rise above it. \n\nI\u2019m not saying OP wasn\u2019t abused or that OP should forgive and forget, or even that Jen gets a free pass here. I\u2019m saying OP was an asshole for agreeing to meet with her sister when clearly there\u2019s no room for reconciliation. OP doesn\u2019t know what her sister went though and doesn\u2019t care to know, OP needs to go NC with her sister.", "I mean y'all can say that. But here Jen was trying to reach out and do better but all she got was insults. Personally don't think OP is that wrong but still pretty asshole.", "you can ignore this person, they're probably your sister. \n\nas someone who has much older siblings as well, you of course were nothing but a victim to the circumstance of being so young while they held power over you.", "And this is why we go NC with some people", ">Agreed. It\u2019s not too uncommon for people who can\u2019t self-reflect or be accountable to create a narrative that benefits them in some way. I really do wonder what she is telling her therapist.\n\nI see you've met my ex.", "It's a place made for the child whose emotional response only entrenches them deeper and no amount of change can undo the damage they were too young to comprehend doing. But they cannot go back. They can only continue out the rest of their life in the place set for them, trying to find a place of acceptance on the edge of an alienated life.       \n\n\nAnd the parents are likewise helpless, stuck in damage control. And the back and forth and the rejection and the unfairness of it all has sealed in emotions so large and tragic that they fluctuate inward and outward as the person wrestles with what to take blame for; what point at which they ought hold themselves responsible for sealing their own fate. It's a pain that knows not where to lodge itself.", "And sister did it first. She assigned OP and Chloe roles.", "<citation needed>", "<citation needed>", "Neither are you, kiddo.", "I mean yeah, she was making crap up that OP was the invisible child and Chloe was the golden child which OP knew was not true. Don't lie unless you're ready to be called out on your bullshit.", "I mean yeah, she was making crap up that OP was the invisible child and Chloe was the golden child which OP knew was not true. Don't lie unless you're ready to be called out on your bullshit.", "You are straight up delusional. You are so far off base", "Dude you're making crap up wholesale, you sure you're not the sister?", "Her personal journey here will only mean something when she reaches the point that she apologizes without caring whether the other person accepts it. \n\nThe sad fact is that most people will never accept an apology, or they will accept it and still not want to be in your life. \n\nIf you are only apologizing so that someone will accept it and completely forget about what you did, then your apology is worthless.\n\nIf she was going to apologize, she started it by victimizing herself. I don\u2019t think she is genuinely apologetic right now. I think she just wants to erase what happened and start over, which is not fair to you. She doesn\u2019t seem to understand just how much her behavior affected other people.", "Sounds like she was preparing to ask for an apology, rather than offer one!!", "I suspect her therapist might be trying to get her to be better even if it means a revisionary view of the past.", "That's not an apology in the slightest. I'd actually consider going complete NC with her. She's toxic.", "Lol! Let\u2019s throw my abusive exes in there too.", "Lol.", "Because people calling themselves after female genitalia are the worst kind of 'feminist'.", "Abuse? They had a screaming match. All siblings had that", "Glad then im 'just an example' good or bad, *shrugs* as I've been told I'm both in my life.\n\nBut I def wouldn't want to be that kind of feminist tbh, rather forward the movement than set it back", "You have empathy? Try having some for the person who developed CPTSD due to her sister's abhorrent treatment of her. Instead you're 'empathizing' with the sister while blaming the victim.\n\n>That's why I see that many in this family are dysfunctional.\n\nYou don't see anything more than what OP told you. 4 paragraphs, all a secondhand account that is largely paraphrased. You know absolutely nothing about this family but you're happy to play armchair psychologist while you accuse others of doing the same thing.", "And maybe they're all clownfish because we're only getting one sde of the story. Bog off.", "Did you not read the post? OP explains Jen was a liar, thief and she made OP her emotional punching bag. That's literally abuse.", "I'm ngl from this post all i see is two asshole. And let's be honest. Is the context really true? Just like every reddit post this seems to be a two sided story", "You should consider why you are spending so much time trying to make victims of child abuse feel bad. Even if that's not your goal, that's what you are doing.", "The fact you keep insisting on blaming OP and being condescending is really disturbing. And you don\u2019t even see how toxic all your comments are. Why are you spending all this energy to make OP feel bad?\nAnd btw you need to search what a scapegoat and a bully are, because you\u2019ve got your definitions mixed up.", "Sometimes things happen because nature plays a bigger role than nurture. May OPs family/parental dynamics be a little messed up? Yeah, problem. Most families are. But that doesn't explain why one child is a terror and the other two are mostly okay. Not everyone who has problems has trauma. Some people are just born with unfortunate predispositions. OPs big sis might have no one to blame but herself. And you certainly can't blame little kids for \"contributing\" to her sister being a hot mess when they were under the age of reason when she was bullying them.\n\nSometimes a bully is just a bully. You cannot always blame the environment. And even if you can find an environmental factor, blaming OP for the abuse she suffered as a child, is dead wrong.", "I get what you're trying to do but please stop feeding the troll.", "I\u2019m no therapist but is it possible that because some of the things Jen did are so reprehensible that she hasn\u2019t been able to face how horrible she has been and has changed the \u201cmemory\u201d so that she isn\u2019t at fault or maybe someone else did that horrible thing? Maybe blocked it so she doesn\u2019t have to remember it?\n\nNTA I commend you for even being willing to talk to your sister much less spend time with her."]}
