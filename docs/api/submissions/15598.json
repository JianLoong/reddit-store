Your words were harsh but they sound like they are spot on and, wording aside, your point was to acknowledge her growth but also point out that it's not ok to claim victimhood after the fact if it keeps you from actually taking responsibility for your actions. It sounds like she has made some strides but if this turns into 'I was actually the victim' then her progress and therapy have gone sideways and it'll become toxic again. You were right to point that out and make sure she knows you have your own memory of how this went down. \n\nIt's complex because she may legitimately have gotten the short end of the stick at times, like assumptions that she'd done something bad when she hadn't, due to the track record of bad things she'd done. She'd be best served to let it all go, rather than try to untangle the web of when she was 'wronged'. I hope she gets over it and continues her growth but I don't think you were an AH for what you said.", "NTA\n\nShe's feeding her therapist a story that fits the narrative in her mind, I would stay low or NC until she can admit her part in how all your younger years played out.", "NTA, but it sounds like you could also benefit from therapy.

Only you know everything she's done to you, but it doesn't seem like ordinary sisterly bs. It sounds like abuse. \n\nThe Y TA comments are ignoring that OP was also abused.

She could have been so enveloped in this  role that she missed out on the reality she created for your family. This isn't to dismiss what your saying but acknowledging that she likely needs more time in therapy to truly understand what she has done and the dynamic she created in the house hold. A personal example is according to my sister I was the \"golden child\" and was given everything, what she conveniently forgets is that I could have nothing until she had it and was responsible with it. So this became I couldn't have a cell phone until she stopped losing her (she lost about 5), and I couldn't have a car until she stopped crashing her (she totaled 3) bit all this was forgotten because all she remembered was the consequences and the punishments not the actions that led to them.

And she also loves to use therapy talk, and genuinely believes she was the wronged party.

That is 100% a 'flaw' in this. However (and I mean this in the least assholish way possible) I don't really care.

He hurt her kids while drinking and doing drugs, but she worshipped him.

First, it answered SO many questions because they love and preference my brother got was delusional.
