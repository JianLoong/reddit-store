She was rude, reckless, a liar, a thief, everything. She refused to go to therapy and fought our mum every step of the way. None of us could have nice things because Jen would ruin them or the moment. She got into a screaming match with Chloe when she was 11 and Jen was 22. There's so much more she's done but it's very personal. She was a bad person. Full stop.\n\nWhen she was 24, she met her current boyfriend who is a literal godsend. Jen finally went to therapy, got a degree and has a job. She's not perfect, but I can acknowledge the effort, as much as I dislike her.\n\nOver the past few months, she's been making an effort to reconnect with the family. Chloe is full NC but me and mum have been seeing her.\n\nI feel like she's been lying to her therapist because she's been told she was the scapegoat, I was the invisible child and Chloe was the golden child. This couldn't be further from the truth. I will admit, at the height of Jen's spiral, mum did assume everything bad was caused by Jen, but that was because it had been years of the same destructive pattern of behaviour. Like, yes Jen, you're an alcoholic, of course she's going to assume it was you who stole her booze. Or assuming she got fired from her job due to her attitude (which is why she got fired from every job beforehand). Or assuming she was being brought home by the police because she regularly breaks the law. This was never mum being malicious, but when that's what you've come to expect over nearly 10 years, you're going to make a snap judgement.\n\nJen and her fianc\u00e9 (Luke) met with me to have coffee and she bought this up and I'll admit, I laughed in her face. She asked what was wrong and I said 'scapegoat? Seriously? Jen, I'm glad you're getting better but you were a piece of shit growing up.'\n\nShe got really upset and said she was trying to reach out. I said I appreciated it but she has to acknowledge how much hurt she caused everyone. She ended up storming out and sent me a text saying she's not going to be disrespected like that and that it took her years to realise the family's 'dynamic'.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Some people have asked me how I know Jen is lying/why I was so dismissive of her. Here's why- her assessment of the sibling's dynamic (golden, invisible and scapegoat child) do not line up at all. I am apparently the invisible child which could not be further from the truth. The same goes with Chloe, who Jen labelled the Golden Child. I'm looking at examples/traits of all three syndromes and none of them line up. \n\nI also want to make it clear that Jen assigned these labels to us, not her therapist. I've learnt that respectable therapists don't use terms like these so my best guess is Jen has pulled this out her ass whilst we were meeting, or her therapist reinforced it. Either way, Jen came up with this alignment which makes me sceptical of her.", "created_utc": 1682357077, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12xpuqz/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_cant_be_a/", "score": 4626, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were right to point that out and make sure she knows you have your own memory of how this went down. \n\nIt's complex because she may legitimately have gotten the short end of the stick at times, like assumptions that she'd done something bad when she hadn't, due to the track record of bad things she'd done.

This isn't to dismiss what your saying but acknowledging that she likely needs more time in therapy to truly understand what she has done and the dynamic she created in the house hold. A personal example is according to my sister I was the \"golden child\" and was given everything, what she conveniently forgets is that I could have nothing until she had it and was responsible with it. So this became I couldn't have a cell phone until she stopped losing her (she lost about 5), and I couldn't have a car until she stopped crashing her (she totaled 3) bit all this was forgotten because all she remembered was the consequences and the punishments not the actions that led to them.

Was Jen ever forced to take a motherly role to help take care of you and Chloe? \n\nThis can often make older siblings treat the younger siblings harsher because they were forced to be a parent to you.

Your brain is hardwired to *not* think that way, because your parents are supposed to take care of you. To admit that your primary caregivers are bad people requires that you go against every instinct you have. Most abused kids internalise - they assume they must have done something wrong, and that's why their parents are mad. It can genuinely take decades for it to click that you never did anything to deserve it. \n\nI'm guessing Jen got this rhetoric from an *actual* abused kid, because that's exactly the kind of thing an actual victim would say.
