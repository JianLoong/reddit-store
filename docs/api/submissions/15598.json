Your words were harsh but they sound like they are spot on and, wording aside, your point was to acknowledge her growth but also point out that it's not ok to claim victimhood after the fact if it keeps you from actually taking responsibility for your actions. It sounds like she has made some strides but if this turns into 'I was actually the victim' then her progress and therapy have gone sideways and it'll become toxic again. You were right to point that out and make sure she knows you have your own memory of how this went down. \n\nIt's complex because she may legitimately have gotten the short end of the stick at times, like assumptions that she'd done something bad when she hadn't, due to the track record of bad things she'd done. She'd be best served to let it all go, rather than try to untangle the web of when she was 'wronged'. I hope she gets over it and continues her growth but I don't think you were an AH for what you said.", "NTA\n\nShe's feeding her therapist a story that fits the narrative in her mind, I would stay low or NC until she can admit her part in how all your younger years played out.", "NTA, but it sounds like you could also benefit from therapy.

Only you know everything she's done to you, but it doesn't seem like ordinary sisterly bs. It sounds like abuse. \n\nThe Y TA comments are ignoring that OP was also abused.

She could have been so enveloped in this  role that she missed out on the reality she created for your family. This isn't to dismiss what your saying but acknowledging that she likely needs more time in therapy to truly understand what she has done and the dynamic she created in the house hold. A personal example is according to my sister I was the \"golden child\" and was given everything, what she conveniently forgets is that I could have nothing until she had it and was responsible with it. So this became I couldn't have a cell phone until she stopped losing her (she lost about 5), and I couldn't have a car until she stopped crashing her (she totaled 3) bit all this was forgotten because all she remembered was the consequences and the punishments not the actions that led to them.

And she also loves to use therapy talk, and genuinely believes she was the wronged party.

No one needs to have sympathy for the person that abused them just cause they might've had it hard too.", "Yet you have not addressed any of the other points I asked in my response. \n\nYour credibility is slipping for me.\n\nEspecially when you are victim blaming.", "And Jen's an asshole for abusing her sister.", "In the words of Regina George \u201cShut up!\u201d  \n\nYou\u2019re all over every comment victim blaming OP. Are you Jen?", "What healing process?! You can't start healing until you accept the truth.", "I am not sure she is one. Possible. We were raised by a probable narcissist.", "Sounds like she's in therapy for a dysfunctional household, which includes parents who are mysteriously missing from the stories of abuse.", "I don't have to address any of your points. \n\nI answered the OPs question. \n\nHave a good day. \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffe", ">Sounds like she's in therapy for a dysfunctional household\n\nI'm in therapy due to CPTSD due to what Jen did to me. As well as for my depression.", "I wish you well in your healing.", "I take it you're done blaming OP for her abuse? \n\n'The way you talk about your sister is disturbing.  \nThe whole family sounds toxic.  \nGood job, Jen!! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe Wishing her the best!'", "NTA.  True change doesn't happen when people fail to take responsibility for their actions but instead create a new narrative that downplays the bad behaviors.  They don't benefit from therapy when they lie to their therapist.  It's not \"reaching out\" when you make reconnecting with family members conditional on their accepting your false \"dynamic\".   \n\nJen hasn't changed a bit.  She's still abusive and controlling, though maybe not quite as loud as before.", "Classic jerk move: rewrite the past and make yourself the victim, and make other people the bad guy. Then blame them and when they try to hold you accountable for your actions get mad and blame them even more. NTA.", "ESH my guess is there is a lot that happened before you were born or before you can remember that you are oblivious to, that very likely informed her behavior and dynamic in the family. Regardless your reaction was rude and you should apologize for it!", "NTA, your sister wants to magically move on because she\u2019s personally ready to move on. She wants everyone to pretend she didn\u2019t act how she did, because she wants to be different now. That\u2019s not how reality works. To actually make a change like that, you need to be able to acknowledge the hurt that you\u2019ve caused others before the change. Or else you\u2019re not really taking the steps to move on.", "NTA", "NTA. And regardless of what she may or may not have gone through, she\u2019s still responsible for how she treated you. HOWEVER, there\u2019s a good ten to twelve years that Jen experienced where you were either not born or were too young to remember and you should leave room for the possibility that that part of her childhood was extremely different from anything you experienced. I know folks who RADICALLY changed parenting styles (or relationship dynamics) between the first and second kid and they had wildly different experiences. While you remember her bad behavior you really don\u2019t know what her most formative years were like.", "NTA - lmfao Chloe 100% has the right idea, you gain nothing from contact with Jen, don't do it for your mom. She failed to protect you from Jen, you owe her nothing.", "NTA Years ago (too many unfortunately) I went to school with a girl who treated people horribly. She was a bully, she made up awful songs about people and got everyone involved in singing them, she created \u2018clubs\u2019 to specifically exclude certain students. I kept my head low to try and stay out of her radar. She was terrible but she had a bad year when rumors traveled around (very small town) that were very damning and some of the students did to her what she had been doing to everyone else and she basically lost her campus control, she was nobody. Her behavior continued after high school and she ended up in required therapy because of some very bad behavior by her. Next thing we hear (again very small town) her sister is blaming those of us who went to school with her, how she was a \u2018victim\u2019 and we made her life a living hell (this supposedly came out in said therapy). I was astonished that someone could be so unaware of reality but I guess, judging by your story that this is far from an isolated incident.", "I think group therapy might be a better way to handle this situation.", "NTA, but there's a time you don't remember and she does. This all could have started because she wasn't able to process not getting your parents sole attention. I 5 &6 when my brothers were born, and I while I was happy to be a big sister, and didn't behave like your sister (I lied like a normal kid, and stole some of their Halloween candy when they were young). I had no clue a newborn needed so much attention. I was a bit more ready and helped with my second brother, but my mom involved me when she safely could, and I didn't share a father with my brothers so I still got only child time (half only child, half big sister lol). I also agree you need therapy, my youngest brother sounds just like your oldest sister. \n\nMaybe if you're all ok with it, have a session together with her therapist? It's not usually recommended, maybe a new one, but it's a thought.", "Both of these things can be true.  Your sister can be scapegoated AND be a monster.", "Were you an ah to your sister? Yes. Does or did she deserve it? Yes. Does that absolve you? No. YTA", "NTA. My mom was in this situation with her sisters (both older, one was very emotionally abusive and the other had substance issues). I know for a fact that the oldest sister had a very different view of the circumstances than either my mom or her other sister - that didn\u2019t make it true.", "Nta", "NTA yeah she's 100% lying to the therapist.", "U", "NTA but you probably could have responded in a better way. Some people repeatedly tell themselves a different version of what they've done in the past so much that they begin believing it. What it takes to restore reality to them can vary wildly from person to person. \n\nNo amount of therapy is going to help her if she can be honest with her therapist.", "Jesus Christ ESH.\n\nWhile yes she need to admit she hurt others, it is full on possible she was the scapegoat. And honestly it sounds like you and your parents weren\u2019t help.she\u2019s getting help, but honestly are you? You sound just as bad as her.", "I can\u2019t say NTA bc you only part of the story of Jen\u2019s life as you admit in the comments.  But I think every single person here bears some blame.  You all sound like a family with some problematic parents and it sounds like you are fighting each other instead of the real issue.\n\nSo ESH", "Is she getting better though? It seems that the sister is delusional. Instead of taking accountability for what she did, she came up with an alternative reality of what really happened. It's easy to get better when your excuse is that you were mistreated and not that you were just a bad person.", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s coming off as bitter, she\u2019s telling the truth and her sister is in denial. I do think she should let go of her anger though not for her sister\u2019s sake but for her own.", "Agreed", "Most people can benefit from therapy, fwiw", "I've done some reading on family systems and basically the idea is that the system subconsciously \"elects\" people for roles like scapegoat and golden child. Then those people will subconsciously lean in to those roles. Not saying that's necessarily what happened here, but it's interesting stuff.", "\ud83d\udcaf", "First day on AITA?", ">You sound just as bad as her\n\nReally? Because I've never pushed a child down the stairs before. Or started a screaming match with an 11 year old because why not.", "Look, NTA, but I don't believe in magic, or magical men. So, I find it hard to believe that your monster of a sister magically transformed into a functional adult because she found a good guy, even assuming that a good guy would want such a monster. Add the significant age gap between you and your sister, and I bet there is another side to this story, and a lot of things you don't know about your sister, especially how your mother raised her.", "Narcissists can do no wrong (according to themselves).", "This. My older sister and I had a very hard relationship growing up. Our mom had cancer and my sister unfortunately had to step in as caretaker at 18 while I was just 10. She tormented me a lot and took her anger out on me in a lot of ways. When our mom died, she left me out of the planning completely and wouldn\u2019t speak to me when I attended college. \n\nThen, she went to therapy - was open and honest and changed herself completely. She apologizes to me all the time for her behavior and takes accountability for how she acted under duress. We have an incredible loving relationship now. \n\nIf I was in OPs shoes tho and my sister said those things, I\u2019d laugh in her face too. She can live her lie on her own time but I wouldn\u2019t let that shit slide in front of me either.", "Agreed. It\u2019s not too uncommon for people who can\u2019t self-reflect or be accountable to create a narrative that benefits them in some way. I really do wonder what she is telling her therapist. \n\nNTA OP. It needed to be said. She\u2019s not going to improve in therapy until she can be accountable. That doesn\u2019t seem to be happening. One of the first steps in therapy is to own their their behavior and understand that they may need help. If they\u2019re not motivated, the work may be difficult. I wish you the best in recovering from this OP.", "You don't have to forget what she did, but that doesn't stop her from being the Scape goat.\n\n\nAnd if there are unhealthy family dynamics it will only benefit you and your sister to explore it.\n\nOtherwise it's likely to continue to repeat in future relationships", "It\u2019s entirely plausible that there was some real dynamic when she was younger that played into how things were by her late childhood and early adulthood.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s on you to explore that, forgive it, or understand it.", "See your liking all the cements that say your not an ahole. But if that\u2019s the case why the hell post to this sub? You do sound just as bad as her, because you admit that you don\u2019t know the full story, and you don\u2019t give a damn. Yes she hurt you and others. But it dose you both nothing if you just flat out ignore the stuff she could of gone through. You need help. So find it.", "It\u2019s common in narcissistic people as well. My mom was similar. She\u2019d neglect me or subject me to some abuse and then turn around like she\u2019s the victim when people ask how she\u2019s doing \ud83d\ude44", "No. nobody ever has to care. my dad treated me like dogshit half the time and basically acted like i didn\u2019t exist the other half. he thought that this was okay because at least he wasn\u2019t as bad as his parents. i don\u2019t care about what happened to him as a kid anymore. i used to use it to excuse and explain away his behavior towards me. but if he uses his abuse as an excuse, then who is to stop me from using mine as an excuse, and if i abuse someone what\u2019s to stop them from using it as an excuse? the cycle doesn\u2019t end until we end it ourselves, starting with saying \u201cfuck off!\u201d to anyone who tries to keep the cycle going. so, wholeheartedly, fuck off.", "Kind of like \"I'm sorry you got your feelings hurt\".", "I ended it with a friend who accidentally hurt me by sneaking up behind me and pushing/shoving me in my back. She knows I\u2019ve had a few back injuries and don\u2019t like to be touched in general. She got mad at me for getting upset with her. Then she gave the fake apology: If I did anything to upset you\u2026\n\nYeah no thanks", "You\u2019re right. It can be common with narcissists. I\u2019ve worked with a few who had the full blown disorder and they all had their narratives that weren\u2019t consistent with objective reality. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you had to go through this. It\u2019s sounds like your mom is using DARVO tactics. I empathize as my dad is the same way. He blames everyone around him and holds grudges about things from my childhood. It\u2019s exhausting. I don\u2019t engage when he starts in on that. I just smile and nod at this point. He\u2019ll never change or accept that he needs treatment.\n\nI\u2019m very LC with my dad now. He\u2019s dying and I didn\u2019t want him to be alone with it.", "I never suggested explaining it away. An explanation can help with understanding. You don't have to forgive or forget.

With that understanding, you can heal and break generational curses. \n\nThat's such a sad thing, \"nobody has to care.\" \n\nI'm sorry for what you've experienced.", "Like when my late brother would come in the kitchen and go off on me and toss my food I was making on the floor. When my parents would tell in apologize, he would say he was sorry but that I was making something he did not like, and I should have known better.", ">An explanation can help with understanding.\n\nBro(and before you ignore my point to point out you're a woman, 'bro' is gn to me)  you literally told me I was disturbed for describing my abuse at the hands of my sister then commended her for it. \n\nThis isn't about explaining things for you. You told me to reevaluate my role in Jen's 'story' as if anything I did at 10 warranted anything she did to me.\n\nI agree that an explanation can help with understanding, but every comment from you so far has been blaming me for 1) my own abuse and 2)  oddly enough, her abuse/actions before I was born/a kid. Please tell me; what could I have done at age 10 and below that would need to me to look at how I 'contributed to her story'.", "Sounds like Jen also has cptsd.\n\nSeems like the whole family is AH.

It seems like they all need it.", "Yes, because what happened to you is disturbing. What you described is disturbing. \n\nI don't think anything you did at 10 warranted anything from your older sister. \n\nRe story. How she viewed you in her story. Which is valid and doesn't invalidate yours. Just offers more context. She can absolutely be the scapegoat and the monster.", "Yet you answered twice, why? To continue being a jerk?\n\nI mean, sure your prerogative but seriously hope you're able to recognize and change that bad behavior.\n\n**PLUS** if it was about answering **OPs** question, you wouldn't be ALL OVER the responses in this post.\n\nMe, yes cause I responded to you.. but what about the others who didnt? That you hopped onto just to keep victim blaming OP and by extension OPs younger sister?", ">Especially the parents\n\nYou know that how? Stop making assumptions when your only goal is to victim blame me and Chloe.", "Again, I wish you healing. \n\nYou all sound like victims. I hope you all find peace. \u2764\ufe0f", "You are so fake. You blamed OP and now you are wishing her healing", "Guuuuuurl get your sanctimonious self OUTTA here with all that negative energy you are literally OOZING into the comments."]}
