Dan dotes on them and they are super super close. \n\nI like Quinn a lot, and we usually get along pretty well. They're a bit quirky and nerdy, which isn't typically what my friends are like, but they're funny and pretty nice. This I think is important for context. Though Quinn identifies as non binary, they're usually gendered as a woman everywhere we go, since they still have long hear, wear makeup, and are on the bigger side with a pretty big chest and are 5 foot nothing tall. They usually wear men's clothing, but occasionally will wear a dress or a skirt. \n\nToday I was discussing wedding plans with Dan and he mentioned that Quinn was going to be a \"groomsperson\" and stand on his side and wear a suit. I was a little shocked by this. I figured that Quinn would wear a dress, since they do wear dresses sometimes, and be on my side. Quinn doesn't use a binder and I'm afraid they would stick out and would confuse my older family members, who I haven't even really had a talk with about Quinn yet. When I expressed this to my fiancee he was mad. \n\nHe said it was inconsiderate of me, and that it showed that I think of Quinn as a woman. I really don't, and I don't mind Quinn being a part of that side of the wedding party for all the before wedding stuff, besides like stuff pertaining to the clothes and what not. Like I don't mind Quinn going to the bachelor party and not the bachelorette. I just think it will look weird and cause unnecessary stress and confusion on the day.\n\nI even said Quinn could wear a black dress or flowy pants made to look like a dress, to better for with their style, but my fiancee isn't having it. He said he won't even ask Quinn about it, cause it will upset them.

Literally just ask them what they\u2019re more comfortable with, and go with that. It doesn\u2019t matter if your older relatives are \u201cconfused.\u201d Supporting and loving Quinn for who they are, regardless of how they present, ought to be more important to you than petty things like that", "Of course YTA. It's not about what the person is wearing or what they identify as. It's about who your husband wants by their side on their wedding day and screw anyone in the audience and how they may feel about it.", "YTA, a homophobe, a bigot, and a bad liar.  This isn't to not \"upset\" your older relatives. Your language speaks volumes. You do not accept Quinn for how they are. You can claim you are open to them all you want. But your words and actions say otherwise. You don't get to decide who is a groomsman, how your fiance's sibling gets to dress.  But I am glad he saw your true colors before the \"I dos\". So hopefully he can get out of this mess.", "YTA; Quinn is your fianc\u00e9\u2019s sibling. Your fianc\u00e9 wants Quinn standing behind him, wearing what Quinn wants. And the reason you feel entitled to request your fianc\u00e9\u2019s sibling wear different clothing is because some of your family members may be uncomfortable with the way they look? Really? \n\nIt\u2019s like if you wanted to wear a blush-colored wedding dress, and your fianc\u00e9 says you shouldn\u2019t because his Grammy prefers virgin white. Does that sound reasonable to you????", "YTA, grow up.", "What should Quinn wear to \u201clook\u201d non-binary according to you? What Color and cut are non-binary? \nYour gender doesn\u2019t have anything to do with how you look but with who you are and how you feel.\nEasy explanation for your family: Quinn is fiance\u2019s sibling and they are really close. \nTry not to always think in absolute heteronormativity please? YTA.", "YTA. Sorry.", "YTA. If you want them in your side they can wear a suit in be on your side. Also women wear suits too?", "Quinn is not gendered as a woman most of the time or ever. They are nonbinary. Assuming large breasts or makeup or long hair or short stature  means someone is a woman or is woman-like is problematic. Anyone can have those physical characteristics or wear those things. When Quinn looks this way, they are still FIRMLY nonbinary. Some enbys use language like femme-presenting/femme or masc/masc-presenting or andro/androgynous. You could ask Quinn if these words apply to them. But if Quinn says they are NOT femme presenting and wears makeup and dresses, they are still not femme and are still not a woman. Their gender isn't necessarily tied up in what they choose to wear or how they groom themselves. \n\nYour fiance is upset because you DO see Quinn as a woman. I'm assuming they are afab (assigned female at birth)? It's really not fair to them that you observe their clothing choices and the body they live in and you immediately slot them into being \"gendered as a woman everywhere we go.\" The assumption that they would wear a dress and be on the bride side since they sometimes do wear dresses is also you seeing them as a woman. \n\nWhen you talk about them sticking out because of their breasts and the fact they don't wear a binder, it sounds like you are more worried about making Quinn conform to gender standards which don't fit them than treating Quinn with love and acceptance. I think you need to try for a mental shift here. Quinn is not judging anyone or asking anyone to change their life or gender identify. They just want to exist and be a part of the family. Other family members who might disapprove of Quinn probably do think Quinn should change. You by trying to disallow Quinn as a groomsperson in a suit also think Quinn should change. Instead of forcing Quinn to change in order to accommodate your biases and those of family members who aren't very accepting, instead provide space for Quinn to participate as they are. The changes that need to happen are that you and other family members need to grow your capacity for accepting people who are not the same as you. Quinn does not need to make a change. \n\nIf you force this, things with Quinn are going to get messed up. They will not feel as comfortable around you. It sounds like your fiance is very close to them. Forcing this may also cause some resentment within your marriage. It may cause your fiance to be concerned about the kind of values you hold. I doubt you want these things to happen. \n\nI'm assuming you are probably the kind of person who wants to respect others and show compassion and acceptance towards those who are different. I'm also assuming based on how you speak that either Quinn is the first enby person you have personally known, or else is one of few. If that's the case, then you of course lack a schema to make sense of how to behave towards people who are not a part of the gender binary (man/woman is the gender binary). You're not a shitty person for lacking that. But you absolutely 100% will be TA if you allow that lack of experience to translate into inappropriate actions (forcing someone to dress a certain way and be a part of the women who are bridesmaids in order to accommodate you and others feeling more comfortable). \n\nInstead try having an open and vulnerable conversation with fiance, Quinn, and/or both where you share that you have identified some ingrained biases you hold about Quinn's gender. Explain that you understand now that these biases can lead to treating people poorly, which is what forcing Quinn to be a bridesmaid is. Explain your concern over other family members being weird. Ask them for suggestions on what to do. I mean suggestions on the best choices to make but also suggestions on how to reframe your understanding of gender inside your mind, and suggestions for the right language to use, etc. Quinn might not want to participate in this conversation, and that's cool. Ask your fiance about it before trying to include Quinn in the conversation. But if you want to not be the asshole, find people around whom you can be vulnerable and open up to about this stuff. Identifying that you are being an asshole and engaging in harmful prejudice is hard and it's normal to look for support to work through that and change behavior. Let this be a learning and growth opportunity rather than a moment when you allow ingrained biases to cause you to treat others inappropriately and a moment in which you cause potentially longterm familial conflicts. Quinn is your family now, so please take the time to do some personal growth so you can be an excellent sister in law to them.", "YTA. You absolutely cannot dictate what gender of clothing Quinn wears and their appearance is not an acceptable reason to say they can\u2019t be a groomsman.", "YTA all the way. You need to accept Quinn as they are, and the sibling relationship as more important than your image of \"girls on the left, boys on the right\" or whatnot. Who said that only one gender is allowed to stand up on anyone's \"side\" at a wedding? And why would you ever value the imagined potential momentary \"confusion\" of your older family members over your spouse's feelings? If I were Quinn's brother, I would hesitate to have the wedding at all now.", "YTA, your an adult stop worrying about how things look and what others think, get over yourself...in a few years no one will remember your wedding anyway.", "YTA. For the first, easy thing, Quinn is Dan\u2019s sibling, not yours. I don\u2019t see why there would be any implicit expectation that Quinn would be on your \u201cside,\u201d when they are Dan\u2019s sibling (and super close, you say). Along with that, I hope you know it is extremely normal in 2022 for people to have groomspeople and bridespeople (?) of all genders, and to not have simply men for a groom and women for a bride. If people are \u201cconfused,\u201d a) explaining \u201cThat\u2019s Quinn, they\u2019re Dan\u2019s sibling and non-binary\u201d is quite easy, you can also end the conversation quickly after that (it\u2019s your wedding, after all) and b) Quinn is, as I mentioned before, Dan\u2019s sibling, so there\u2019s nothing abnormal about them being there in support of Dan. \n\nSo yes, you\u2019re not being supportive of Quinn (you even say they don\u2019t regularly wear skirts). Let Dan (and Quinn) make the decisions on this.", "YTA. If Quinn is in the wedding party regardless, who cares what side they\u2019re on? If their gender presentation could go either way, ASK if what they want to wear rather than just assume.", "YTA. It shouldn\u2019t matter what Quinn is wearing or where they stand, they are your fianc\u00e9\u2019s sibling - so it\u2019s really not up to you. It sounds like you\u2019re just as judgemental as your older family members.", "YTA. Your fianc\u00e9 wants Quinn standing next to him when he gets married. What they wear is up to them. Is the outfit really that important? You need to reconsider your wedding priorities if it is.", "YTA\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t make Quinn conform to gender norms just to be less confusing or make your older and less open minded family members feel more comfortable. You\u2019re creating more drama than necessary.", ">Quinn's parents are alright with it, but don't really understand.\n\nWhy have you decided they don't really understand? Because if they did, they wouldn't be okay with it? \n\nYTA. What you need to realize is that literally *no one* except yourself gives one flying fuck about your wedding, least of all who is in your wedding party. Get your head out of your white, lace and satin covered ass, and just realize that the only thing that matters in life is the relationships you have with others. \n\nI can't stress enough that NO ONE IN THE ENTIRE PLANET cares about who is in your wedding other than you. You will damage relationships if you decide to die on this hill.\n\nGod, the shit that future bride's care about when 50% of marriages end in divorce anyway.", "You. Are. The. Asshole. \nYou are also transphobic and acting fucking rediculous. Get over yourself. \n\nOnce more- Get Over Yourself\n\nIf you want you loved ones at your wedding let them come as they are or... Don't have your loved ones at your wedding. Have no one there. Shit. Maybe your fiancee will see you for who you truly are and call off the wedding.", "YTA - Quinn is his sibling and wants Quinn to represent him. Whether Quinn wears a suit or a dress has nothing to do where Quinn stands. Dan is standing up for his sibling.", "This and a lot of women who identify and present as women wear suits as groomsmen all the time..its not even weird or unheard-of..and I doubt anyone would be confused\n\nNice well made suits look lovely on everyone.\n\nYTA."]}
