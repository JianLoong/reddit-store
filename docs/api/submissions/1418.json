It's about who your husband wants by their side on their wedding day and screw anyone in the audience and how they may feel about it.", "YTA, a homophobe, a bigot, and a bad liar.  This isn't to not \"upset\" your older relatives. Your language speaks volumes. You do not accept Quinn for how they are. You can claim you are open to them all you want. But your words and actions say otherwise. You don't get to decide who is a groomsman, how your fiance's sibling gets to dress.  But I am glad he saw your true colors before the \"I dos\". So hopefully he can get out of this mess.", "YTA; Quinn is your fianc\u00e9\u2019s sibling. Your fianc\u00e9 wants Quinn standing behind him, wearing what Quinn wants. And the reason you feel entitled to request your fianc\u00e9\u2019s sibling wear different clothing is because some of your family members may be uncomfortable with the way they look? Really? \n\nIt\u2019s like if you wanted to wear a blush-colored wedding dress, and your fianc\u00e9 says you shouldn\u2019t because his Grammy prefers virgin white. Does that sound reasonable to you????", "YTA, grow up.", "What should Quinn wear to \u201clook\u201d non-binary according to you? What Color and cut are non-binary? \nYour gender doesn\u2019t have anything to do with how you look but with who you are and how you feel.\nEasy explanation for your family: Quinn is fiance\u2019s sibling and they are really close. \nTry not to always think in absolute heteronormativity please? YTA.", "YTA. Sorry.", "YTA. If you want them in your side they can wear a suit in be on your side. Also women wear suits too?", "Quinn is not gendered as a woman most of the time or ever. They are nonbinary. Assuming large breasts or makeup or long hair or short stature  means someone is a woman or is woman-like is problematic. Anyone can have those physical characteristics or wear those things. When Quinn looks this way, they are still FIRMLY nonbinary. Some enbys use language like femme-presenting/femme or masc/masc-presenting or andro/androgynous. You could ask Quinn if these words apply to them. But if Quinn says they are NOT femme presenting and wears makeup and dresses, they are still not femme and are still not a woman. Their gender isn't necessarily tied up in what they choose to wear or how they groom themselves. \n\nYour fiance is upset because you DO see Quinn as a woman. I'm assuming they are afab (assigned female at birth)? It's really not fair to them that you observe their clothing choices and the body they live in and you immediately slot them into being \"gendered as a woman everywhere we go.\" The assumption that they would wear a dress and be on the bride side since they sometimes do wear dresses is also you seeing them as a woman. \n\nWhen you talk about them sticking out because of their breasts and the fact they don't wear a binder, it sounds like you are more worried about making Quinn conform to gender standards which don't fit them than treating Quinn with love and acceptance. I think you need to try for a mental shift here. Quinn is not judging anyone or asking anyone to change their life or gender identify. They just want to exist and be a part of the family. Other family members who might disapprove of Quinn probably do think Quinn should change. You by trying to disallow Quinn as a groomsperson in a suit also think Quinn should change. Instead of forcing Quinn to change in order to accommodate your biases and those of family members who aren't very accepting, instead provide space for Quinn to participate as they are. The changes that need to happen are that you and other family members need to grow your capacity for accepting people who are not the same as you. Quinn does not need to make a change. \n\nIf you force this, things with Quinn are going to get messed up. They will not feel as comfortable around you. It sounds like your fiance is very close to them. Forcing this may also cause some resentment within your marriage. It may cause your fiance to be concerned about the kind of values you hold. I doubt you want these things to happen. \n\nI'm assuming you are probably the kind of person who wants to respect others and show compassion and acceptance towards those who are different. I'm also assuming based on how you speak that either Quinn is the first enby person you have personally known, or else is one of few. If that's the case, then you of course lack a schema to make sense of how to behave towards people who are not a part of the gender binary (man/woman is the gender binary). You're not a shitty person for lacking that. But you absolutely 100% will be TA if you allow that lack of experience to translate into inappropriate actions (forcing someone to dress a certain way and be a part of the women who are bridesmaids in order to accommodate you and others feeling more comfortable). \n\nInstead try having an open and vulnerable conversation with fiance, Quinn, and/or both where you share that you have identified some ingrained biases you hold about Quinn's gender. Explain that you understand now that these biases can lead to treating people poorly, which is what forcing Quinn to be a bridesmaid is. Explain your concern over other family members being weird. Ask them for suggestions on what to do. I mean suggestions on the best choices to make but also suggestions on how to reframe your understanding of gender inside your mind, and suggestions for the right language to use, etc. Quinn might not want to participate in this conversation, and that's cool. Ask your fiance about it before trying to include Quinn in the conversation. But if you want to not be the asshole, find people around whom you can be vulnerable and open up to about this stuff. Identifying that you are being an asshole and engaging in harmful prejudice is hard and it's normal to look for support to work through that and change behavior. Let this be a learning and growth opportunity rather than a moment when you allow ingrained biases to cause you to treat others inappropriately and a moment in which you cause potentially longterm familial conflicts. Quinn is your family now, so please take the time to do some personal growth so you can be an excellent sister in law to them.\n\n-- Sincerely a non-binary afab redditor who is often femme presenting but is definitely not a woman and would refuse to wear a dress.", "YTA. You absolutely cannot dictate what gender of clothing Quinn wears and their appearance is not an acceptable reason to say they can\u2019t be a groomsman.", "YTA all the way. You need to accept Quinn as they are, and the sibling relationship as more important than your image of \"girls on the left, boys on the right\" or whatnot. Who said that only one gender is allowed to stand up on anyone's \"side\" at a wedding?

Along with that, I hope you know it is extremely normal in 2022 for people to have groomspeople and bridespeople (?) of all genders, and to not have simply men for a groom and women for a bride. If people are \u201cconfused,\u201d a) explaining \u201cThat\u2019s Quinn, they\u2019re Dan\u2019s sibling and non-binary\u201d is quite easy, you can also end the conversation quickly after that (it\u2019s your wedding, after all) and b) Quinn is, as I mentioned before, Dan\u2019s sibling, so there\u2019s nothing abnormal about them being there in support of Dan. \n\nSo yes, you\u2019re not being supportive of Quinn (you even say they don\u2019t regularly wear skirts).
