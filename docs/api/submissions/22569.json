That seems so odd to me. \n\nIf OP decides she dislikes that he didn't want to spend time with her, or that this is a bad sign for their relationship, so be it.

I'm pretty sure he wasn't using you for shelter but wanted to spend the night with you even though you were both independently at the same event. I think if your communication (both of you) was clearer prior to the event then your expectations of how the event would unfold would have been different. You basically threw away the relationship on a miscommunication. It's not written but you didn't say I want you to meet my friends we are here. Just that you were at x spot and then expected him to show up. All the while he didn't agree to meet you there. Festivals are usually a mess so I doubt he thought you were going to be there all day. It's obvious you care about him at least a little otherwise you wouldn't be upset that you didn't meet up.", "YTA. The guy asked to stay with you as a favour and you agreed to it.

Why is he only initiating that when it's dark and the festival is over?", "yeah I can correct you. As a woman, I'm the one to say \"hey wanna hang out? can I stay here? you wanna kiss? wanna hump?\" and it's great. Guys either feel threatened or encouraged, but it's never going to come from a place of confusion, because I'll be clear about my intentions.", "She definitely should NOT do that.", "you sound like a real treat.\n\nhope your next partner is a mind reader.", "Stew melt over sensitive? What the fuck??", "I agree with this, but it\u2019s the not responding to a single text in 7 hours that does it for me. Not even a \u201cCool! Maybe we\u2019ll run into ya\u201d or something?", "I don\u2019t have terms and conditions of agreements in deciding who I spend the night with, lol. If I feel disrespected I\u2019m gonna bounce.", "Honestly, I'd have the same expectation with almost anyone regardless of the relationship.\n\nIf someone says \"*I'm here*\" and someone responds \"*Cool! I'm by the XYZ*\", the implication is that you're gonna meet up. If you're not planning to meet up, you should say as much.\n\nIf it's an especially casual relationship, you might not really care whether they show up. But it's still the expectation and a \"*What happened? You never showed up?*\" question wouldn't be out of place.", "Do you need every interaction to be laid out with bullet points and fine print? I mean yeah it\u2019s a short time of dating but still if I am dating some one for a month or so and they wanted to come up to the festival I am at to stay with me I would expect to meet up at one point. It\u2019s the least they could do.", "Plus OP calling him \"guy\"", "He expected to stay at her place that night though...", "Right? Why play games?", "I'm engaged and my partner isn't a moron, luckily.", "You don\u2019t eat frozen stew on a stick? And then get mad when it melts all over you? Some analysts people are pretty sheltered\u2026", "yeah if I asked the person I'm dating for a stay overnight and they told me yes, then no because I didn't follow the plan they didn't tell me about... I'd feel disrespected too YTA", "And the person who bounced wasn\u2019t told of your expectations. \n\nAnd, no, giving your location isn\u2019t the same thing as saying, \u201cCome over and hang out.\u201d", "This is it. He\u2019s also too old for this bullshit.", "I'm sorry but it just sounds like you're being petty because he hung out with his friends instead of you. Kind of childish tbh.", "But renegging on our promise to put someone up because you got in your feelings about something that was never part of the plan is incredibly rude. YTA", "If you are changing your plans about someone's ride or where they are spending the night you need to give them as much h lead tome as possible to make other arrangements, not spring it on them last minute.", "Hanging out wasn't part of the agreement y'all had, though.\n\nYTA", "I\u2019m with you a 100 percent, but as a guy, we\u2019re clueless. Sometimes, we really NEED it spelled out. I cringe so hard looking back at my early days of dating where I had to have friends tell me a girl was interested in me because I was too oblivious to see it and figured she was just being friendly.", "\u201cDating\u201d is such a vague term these days. Are they boyfriend and girlfriend? are they exclusive? Are they casually seeing each other and still keeping options open?\n\nfor me this is a much different scenario depending on the \u201cdefinition of the relationship\u201d and it seems like they haven\u2019t really defined it, leading to two different sets of expectations, leading to this post", "they aren't dating, they've been \"seeing each other\"- which just isn't the same. they probably aren't exclusive or committed in any way.", "Yes. Actual communication solves a wide variety of problems.", "If a girl I was dating for 6 weeks made plans to go to a music festival without me and later i made separate plans to go to the same festival I would assume she didn't want me to meet her friends yet unless she specifically asked me to come over and meet up with her.", "It literally is the same thing. Who do you tell ur location to without trying to meet?", "the whole \u201cI\u2019m gonna spend the day with my friends but also have plans to meet up with a boy/girl at night\u201d move is honestly pretty common on the festival scene", "She can change her mind about sleeping with someone! This is nuts. If you find out someone isn\u2019t that into you, and is using you, you can call it quits.", "Well, he was expecting her to take him back to her place for the night. He could have at least met her friends and bought her a drink. This guy absolutely expected a lot for nothing in return.", "Dude, you are 33 fucking years old. Communicate like a damn adult. Stop vaguely and passively aggressive telling people your expectations and just say them.\n\nThis guy said he wanted a place to stay, not see you during the concert. It's pretty clear he planned to see you that night. If you had an issue with that, you should have said so before agreeing to *let him stay the night with you*.", "Unless she explicitly tells him to come over he might think she's not ready for him meet her friends."]}
