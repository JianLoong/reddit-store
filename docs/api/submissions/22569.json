He wanted to use you for a place to crash and that's it.", "INFO... Was he ever aware of the plan to meet your friends? Or was this just wishful thinking on your part?", "I'm going to be unpopular and go with a soft YTA. Nowhere in your post did you indicate he got a last minute ticket so he could hang out with you and your friends at the festival. He said he got a last minute ticket with a group of his friends. He asked if he could stay at your place after the festival and you said yes. He went to the festival with his friends, you went with yours. He must've assumed you'd be meeting up at the end of it so that he could go back to your place (which you agreed ahead of time he could do). Then you bail on him because he didn't bother to come look for you in a crowd of 50,000 people that day. No wonder he was confused...", "I can\u2019t tell if he was dragging ass when you wanted leave or if this was just you being petty at feeling ditched? Otherwise maybe ESH?\u2026 I can understand maybe the two of you weren\u2019t very clear and had different ideas of what the plans were. But if he was taking too long to get to you and you had to leave then NTA. If you just left bc you were mad YTA.", "YTA. It seems like his original request - which you agreed to - was for him to stay overnight. I'm unsure why you decided that if he didn't join you for the concert you would reneg on that agreement. He didn't change his story, did he? He didn't say he planned to meet up earlier, or planned to meet your friends. It was not fair for you to back out on what you'd agreed to based on his behavior.", "NTA. Sounds like he is just using you.", "NTA. You made mutual plans and he bails, then expects you to be ok with it. All I see are red flags, run!", "NTA. \n\nHe was just trying to use you for a free ride, free accommodations, and maybe a little....you know... If he had good intentions, and was a good person, he would have tried meeting up with you over the course of several hours. Someone who is over 30 should be able to do better. \n\nRad flags here - run.", "NTA- lmao \ud83e\udd23 that\u2019s what he gets", "NTA- had the same thing happen and wished I left him in hindsight tbh", "NTA\n\nHe didn't want to be with you until he needed a place to stay.  He wasn't there to BE with you, he was there to CRASH with you after the concerts.", "Ya, no. NTA. He's not into your friendship enough to hang out or meet your friends, he's just looking for a hookup and a place to crash. I'd block him and move on. Bro can uber home and reflect on how to smooth out his game next time.", "NTA sounds like he was just planning on using you for the night", "NTA, you were a free taxi and lodgings when it suited him as you point out, dump him, you deserve better.", "YTA\u2026 you should have told him you wanted him to meet your friends. He asked if he could crash with you, you said yes. If you wanted to spend the festival together, you should have said that. Instead you got mad over something he wasn\u2019t aware of and left him stranded.", "NTA\n\nI would have assumed that you would've met up with them at some point you are dating after all. Only saving grace in his book would be if he didn't have any good signal because that can sometimes happen at festivals.", "Seems you viewed it as a relationship while he viewed you as a resource.  I get the sense you made an assumption that \u201cstay with you\u201d meant spend time at the concert with you and meet your friends when it likely did not; it just meant stay the night with you just like the guy said.  You\u2019re in your 30s, so my expectations for clearer communication are higher than 20-somethings.  The relationship seems problematic concert aside.  Still, borderline YTA because it seems guy literally asked for exactly what he wanted, you agreed but assumed something else, and you cancelled because your assumption was wrong.", "NTA. Title had me ready to go the other way but sounds like he kinda ditched you?", "Mild YtA for not letting him stay with you; you agreed to his request without telling him that it was conditional upon meeting your friends. You have the *right* to keep him out of your home for any reason, but unless he did something that made you feel unsafe or new circumstances made it unfeasible, it was unfair to turn him out on such short notice.\n\nHowever, it's not like you left him stranded in the wilderness.

I would expect someone I\u2019m dating to actually spend time with me at the same festival we\u2019re attending, especially if we\u2019re going to stay with each other for the night. It\u2019s rude to just blow off your significant other and use them for housing", "YTA unless you specifically agreed to hang out together. Your post says that you were going with friends, he was going with friends, and he was staying at yours afterwards. That seems a pretty clear cut situation to me. I guess it might\u2019ve been fun to meet up at some point but it seems unfair to decide that your prior agreement hinges on that happening, without doing anything except dropping a few hints.", "People in their early 30s going to a music festival and fighting lmfaoooo this belongs on the teenagers sub", "It seems like YTA. Did you ever express to him that you'd like for him to meet your friends? It seems like it was clearly expressed that you would be spending the day with your friends and he would be spending the day with his. A simple \"Hey, let's meet up so you can meet my friends\" would have done it. Instead, he's confused because he has no idea what he did wrong. Perhaps just speak up and don't assume.", "YTA\n\nHe ASKED if he could stay with you after the concert. You agreed.\n\nYou ASSUMED that he would meet you and your friends there. You DIDN'T communicate that to him. You sent him your location at a big concert, but didn't communicate that meeting him is important to you.\n\nThen you were angry he didn't do the things YOU wanted in your HEAD but didn't COMMUNICATE. Because of this, you broke the agreement for him to stay with you.\n\nThe guy dodged a bullet.", "This is what I was wondering as well.  Maybe he didn't realize that it was important to OP and figured they were just having friends separately with their friends that day. I'm also wondering what their correspondence was like during the festival.  Were they texting back and forth?", "Yes he know me and my friends were all staying together, so he didn\u2019t have a problem with meeting them (just didn\u2019t want to hang out at the concert, apparently).", "Yes I was definitely mad (feeling used for place to stay only). Is that not a good excuse to be mad? If so, reasonable behavior on my part?", "Is it not reasonable to assume somebody you\u2019re dating would want to hang out with you at a music festival?", "Why? What did he do wrong?", "Yeah, this. Surprised at all the N T A comments tbh.", "Signals were fine, I considered that too but other texts went through \u2639\ufe0f", "Great point!", "OP here- yes we were texting occasionally. He told me when he arrived, I told him where we were camped out etc", "Your avoiding the question and we know why. You never told him you wanted him to meet your friend. You just assumed it would happen. \n\nYou also agreed to let him stay with you and in the last minute ditched him. \n\nYTA", "That still doesn't really answer the question. He asked if he could stay with you and then when it was time for that to actually happen, you bailed on him. Sounds like you were expecting him to put in time to earn the accommodation. YTA", "Reasonable? Yes. Punishing them for not living up to your assumption? Absolutely not.", "It's not what you agreed to. You had each planned to attend separately (him last minute) and you knew he was attending with his friends, and his request was to stay with you (I'm perceiving that to mean overnight/afterwards, not during). YOU assumed you would be together for some portion of the concert itself but I see no indication he shared that expectation.", "What was the exact text conversation? I think from that it becomes clear whether or not you two were going to meet up and how soon etc.  \n\n\nThere is also a remote possibility that he actually wanted to give you some space since, as you said, you already arranged this with your friends.  \n\n\nI don't know, let's see the texts.", "Sure, it's reasonable, but it being reasonable doesn't make it any less an *assumption.* You thought one thing, he thought another, neither of you really explicitly communicated what you expected - though he came closer - so it's no wonder that everything fell apart. You're both old enough that you should be able to communicate more effectively.", "No it\u2019s not reasonable. If he had just gotten the ticket and invited himself to your outing with your friends he\u2019d be an AH. Him and some friends got last minute tickets.. you already had your plans. Unless it was specifically agreed that it was ok for him and his friends to join your group why would they? That would be rude. It would have been better if both of you were clear \u2026 did you ever say when are we meeting up?", "Didn\u2019t meet up when the whole point of the day was to meet up meet each others friends. The implication is that he was just using OP for a place to sleep and hookup rather than meaningful connection during the festival", "Lucky, last festival I went to signal was terrible. I had a friend there also and we did plan to potentially meet but when I sent a message at 1PM and it didn't send until 3, and they didn't reply until 4. I just replied telling them what artists I was going to see and left it up to fate to push us together.", "I should feel like I have to hold up my promise of spending the night with him, after realizing he didn\u2019t even want to hang out with me?", "\"Hey I got a last minute ticket to a music festival I know you're going to. Mind if I crash at yours after?\"\n\nI think there is a level of assumption that can be accepted from OP but they are dating.... I would expect people who are dating to **want** to see each other at the event they are both seeing. \n\nAlso why didn't they just ask one of their friends that they spent the entire day with?", "I deleted all texts when I threw in the towel on this guy\u2026\ud83e\udd72\nBut I told him exactly where we were set up so he could find us so I don\u2019t think he felt like he was imposing (and he wasn\u2019t shy about asking for a place to stay so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s his nature to begin with)", "Ya definitely, communication miss on my part", "This exactly^^^^ \nFun-war gets it", "You\u2019re being a stew melt over sensitive. He could also assume that because you went to the concert with friends you didn\u2019t want to hang out a him at home. It was a concert.. you were with friends he was with friends\u2026 everyone enjoys the day and you meet up after.. you should have been clear with each other the whole thing may have been a miss communication\u2026", "Yes. Because you never asked him if he wanted to hang out with your friends, and he never said he was going to hang out with you. If you both made independent plans to go to the same event, and he literally told you he is going with his friends, I wouldn't have assumed he's gonna come hang with you. It was an unreasonable expectation in this specific case. \n\nWhen you agreed to let him stay the night, you never mentioned he was expected to spend the day with you. You made a wrong assumption and then got mad at him that he didn't read your mind. \n\nYou can decide to do whatever you want, including changing your kind past minute about having him stay over. You're just an asshole for it.", "I assume he didn't because of some logistical issue. You think it's ok for OP to back out on an agreement last minute because he didn't do something he never asked or agreed to do? That seems so odd to me. \n\nIf OP decides she dislikes that he didn't want to spend time with her, or that this is a bad sign for their relationship, so be it. But OP decided to go back on what she'd agreed just because he didn't live up to unspoken expectations, for non-existent plans.", "Him not responding for 6-7 hours and then asking for the lift and place to sleep just seems like he is using her. He probably didn't appreciate being shown the floor by his friends so opted to try and get a bed.", "OP here: yes, I backed out of plans when I got more information (that he didn\u2019t want to hang out, he only wanted a place to stay.) I didnt want him to stay (or even see him at this point), and thought he was a big boy who could figure out a ride home.", "If she feels used, then fine. But he was doing exactly what he'd said he was going to do - which was attend the concert with friends and crash with OP. OP deciding she didn't like that plan, last minute, and bailing, is what makes her TA."]}
