You're just an asshole for it.\n\nTBH You mentioned its 6 weeks and tumultuous. Honestly you 2 don't seem to be a good fit and it's probably best not to keep dating.", "I assume he didn't because of some logistical issue.

That seems so odd to me. \n\nIf OP decides she dislikes that he didn't want to spend time with her, or that this is a bad sign for their relationship, so be it.

I'm pretty sure he wasn't using you for shelter but wanted to spend the night with you even though you were both independently at the same event. I think if your communication (both of you) was clearer prior to the event then your expectations of how the event would unfold would have been different. You basically threw away the relationship on a miscommunication. It's not written but you didn't say I want you to meet my friends we are here. Just that you were at x spot and then expected him to show up. All the while he didn't agree to meet you there. Festivals are usually a mess so I doubt he thought you were going to be there all day. It's obvious you care about him at least a little otherwise you wouldn't be upset that you didn't meet up.", "YTA. The guy asked to stay with you as a favour and you agreed to it.
