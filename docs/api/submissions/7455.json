Maybe you need to give him an ultimatum either be a dad and husband or he can share 50/50 custody.", "The working out is irrelevant. It sounds like your husband doesn't help enough with your daughter or the house, so he is the AH.

At this point it doesn't make a difference since you are pretty much a single parent already.\n\nAnd to his question, yes, you definitely want him to work out less or stop. It's not healthy for the relationship.", "He is avoiding his marriage my working out.", "When do you get to work out? You don\u2019t, do you? I\u2019d see how he reacts if you propose to alternate days. On his days, he gets the kid ready for school and makes dinner and cleans up after, while you do whatever you want, including working out if that\u2019s what you decide. Your days you do what you\u2019ve already been doing. Laundry will be split by weeks or months - every other one swaps. Does he think that\u2019s not fair? Why? Why is his time and his health more valuable than yours? Another option would be to plan a trip and get out of town for a week. He has to do it all, which shouldn\u2019t be hard since you do it, right?\n\nI hope he gets it together, but to be perfectly honest your life would be easier if you split. Half the laundry, free time to have your own hobbies and life, work out if you want to, clean up only your own mess and your child\u2019s.

The answer to \"so you want me to stop working out\" is yes.  He's clearly doing it at the expense of his relationship with his child and shirking any responsibility around the home.  Working out is fine, but only if it doesn't interfere with the other two. \n\nFor me, I'd say let the lunch workout stay since once kiddo is in kinder, he can't keep popping by there, maybe switch out mornings so you get a break on that end, and pick a few evenings to work out together as a family.", "\u201cSo you want me to stop working out?\u201d\n\n\u201cYES BITCH\u201d \n\nNTA", "NTA life is all about balancing the time we spend to ourselves and with our family, at work, etc. Talk about it with him in a non accusatory way and if that doesn't work, marriage/family counseling.", "Marriage therapy now.

I honestly wonder if he\u2019s actually getting some of his \u201cworkouts\u201d with a side piece. I could be way off base but something about this raises red flags.

I think the following are reasonable points: asking him to make time in his schedule to be a participating family member by contributing with chores, QT with your daughter, and helping parent his children. They\u2019re reasonable because you\u2019ve attempted to have conversations with him about this. \n\nWhether or not it needs to eat into his workout time can be something he figures out in his own schedule and with you for the family schedule. There has to be other times or ways he can show up and do something to be part of the family. \n\nHe\u2019s an AH for not caring to participate in the family or even have dialogue with you about this like an adult. This seems like an unsustainable way to go about having a family. It\u2019s pretty selfish tbh. \n\nSorry you have an absent partner/coparent/sex life.", "NTA  While your husband should take care of himself, there is a limit. It is negatively impacting your marriage and family life. You need to have a serious talk with him. If things don\u2019t change, I would leave him.

Do your fair share of chores. Participate in this family. If you don't the next time this comes up will be when I'm handing you divorce papers.

You're NTA for wanting to spend time with your husband and have him pull his weight in the relationship. But I think you have a communication problem going on because when you say \"I want to spend more time with you. I need your help around the house. And I want you to spend more time with our kid\" he's hearing \"I want you to work out less\". That's either a major communication issue, in which case I would suggest marriage counseling to resolve your inability to communicate with each other, or he's intentionally gaslighting you to put you on the defensive.

I would have addressed this problem a year and a half ago. \nSounds like you're already a single parent.", "I literally separated with my husband over not participating in the family. I don\u2019t care what the reason is, if I could do it, he can do it. That means chores, taking care of the kid, and spending quality time. What you\u2019re asking for is not unreasonable and he needs to figure out a way to fit it all in if he\u2019s unwilling to sacrifice. And to answer his question - yes he should stop working out if it means he cannot be a father and husband. On the list of priorities if you and your child aren\u2019t even above the gym, then why the F be a family?

No doubt you also have interests that have been put on the shelf since becoming a parent. He hasn't adjusted his old lifestyle to accommodate parenthood as you have. He needs a reality check.", "NTA. I had to cut back on my hobbies when I became a dad. And that's what your husband's workouts are. They're far beyond what someone needs to stay healthy. He's avoiding his family and neglecting them.\n\nNow, maybe he has something going on mentally that needs counseling. Men can have body image issues. Men with body dismorphia often obsessively work out spending hours at the gym.", "NTA\n\nThere\u2019s a huge difference between keeping fit and scheduling activities and sleep for every would-be waking hour you would otherwise spend with the actual members of your family or pulling your weight around your own goshdarn house.\n\nForget the working out. The issue that needs addressing is why he thinks the morning childcare and housework defaults to you, and when you get a) a break and b) time together.", "NTA. Also, when does he give you time to workout? If he understands how important fitness is, then he would want his wife, the mother of his child, and the person he claims to love, to work out too, right?\n\nAlso, what's stopping him from buying a jogging stroller and taking your toddler with him?", "NTA.  Curious did the behavior start b4 baby or after?  If it was a routine prior to baby you need to have some communication on his time management because it needs to be rearranged to account for daddy time and then hubby time.

Was his fitness something that attracted you to him initially?
