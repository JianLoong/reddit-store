It's not bad now, but strained at times. My MIL is vocal that she doesn't agree with our parenting decisions and has been harsh about it. There's also a cultural aspect that I think has led to some hard feelings. My husband's culture is one where grandparents are extremely involved in day to day care of kids in the family, and my MIL has seemed offended that we are more independent. We make an effort for them to spend time with our kids, but it's never enough. We live 20 minutes away and see them a few times per month, sometimes more. \n\nMy in laws have 4 other grandkids, all from my SIL and all between 5-15 years old. My SIL's family has annual passes to Disney so they go often. This year they've been 4 or so times, and it's great that they are making memories with their kids. \n\nThe family knows that our kids are getting really into Disney lately. My husband and I have been talking about when is a good time for the kids' first Disney experience and thought maybe a Disney cruise would be good since they are too little for a lot of the rides at DW but can still meet the characters/ experience the magic.\n\nToday my husband's other sister let us know my in laws are taking her (single/no kids), other SIL/husband, and their 4 kids on a Disney cruise for Thanksgiving this year. She wanted us to know because the whole family will be gone for the holiday and she said she feels bad that we will feel left out. \n\nI am disappointed that my in laws could take 4 of their 6 grandkids on a big family vacation and not even invite the 2 youngest who are coming into prime Disney age. It's not about the money - my in laws are financially sound, as are we. We would not want or expect them to pay for our family to go (though they are paying for my SIL's family of 6), but to not be invited on a family vacation is hurtful. My 3 year old would be ecstatic about a Disney trip. \n\nI hurt for my kids, that they are left out. I hurt for my husband, who is wondering what he did wrong. And I am angry that they didn't feel bothered tell us themselves that they'll all be off together for Thanksgiving without us.\n\nNow the holidays feel awkward, and tbh I don't feel like making the effort for Christmas. I know we're not entitled to be included in someone else's vacation, but I can't help feel upset at the extreme favoritism. I'm thankful my kids are too young to see the pictures on SM, but it doesn't mean they won't hear about the trip from their cousins (to be fair, I'm really only referring to my 3yo, but he would be sad).\n\nWe've been talking about taking our kids on a Disney cruise anyways, so WIBTA if we said screw it, we're taking them for Christmas?", "created_utc": 1698554643, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ivh7u/aita_for_taking_my_kids_on_vacation_for_christmas/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How mature of your in-laws to take out their beef with you on to your kids. Gee they sure showed you that you were missing out on not seeing them more enough. \\*eye roll.", "Play by your own rules.

I\u2019ve done Disney Cruise Line frequently and am under the impression these times fill up quickly.  In fact I\u2019d be curious how long your in-laws have been planning the Thanksgiving cruise.  I\u2019d guess close to a year, which makes the silence about it even more curious.  Even if there was no way you would have joined in, as you customarily spend Thanksgiving with them they should have told you they have alternate plans this year.\n\nAlso, by the way, a Disney Cruise is a great way for little ones to experience the magic while too young for park enjoyment.  Be aware you must be toilet trained to use the pools and drop kids at the kids\u2019 clubs.  There are some ships with water feature splash pads for small toddlers play.  And you can book the nursery.  \n\nHope you have a magical holiday whatever you do!", "Nta that looks like favoritism. No one needs to spend a ton of time with their in laws", "NTA.

I come from experience. You\u2019ll come to a point where you can function with your inlaws as required (whatever that means for your family) but mama bear instincts take over much more quickly moving forward. Soon your children will realize the difference in treatment. \n\nLET THEM. It\u2019s a fact of life and it\u2019s not a bad thing to learn though we certainly don\u2019t wish it upon anyone. Be careful to be matter of fact about the situation and don\u2019t show any disrespect, disgust, or anger in front of the children. In front of them, it simply is what it is. This way it just isn\u2019t upsetting to them. \n\nAnd that\u2019s how you simultaneously help your kids grow through a nasty situation and enact revenge on your inlaws\u2026not traumatizing for the littles as they take what they can get and constant irritation for the bigs because they will wonder why they don\u2019t matter. \n\nSigned, a petty daughter-in-law who has never gloated about this before \ud83d\ude1d", "NTA.\n\nIs MIL trying to prove a point that cos she doesn't see your kids daily or isn't overly involved with them as she'd like to be, then they'll miss out?

MIL isn't even thinking about quality time spent with the kids, just the quantity of it imo. \n\nBook your trip. Being an involved grandparent is a privilege, not a right, and you don't need to change your parenting just because she doesn't agree.", "I\u2019d go for it. If your kids would love it and you have time off, do it. You only live once.", "NTA, go & book the holiday & screw them. Your husband needs to talk to his parents, though, to find out why your family was not even invited on the holiday, even if you covered the costs yourself.", "NTA. Do it. I cannot understand how they could be so rude, and if I were your SIL, I would refuse to go.\n\nOur traditional annual vacation with my entire family is 3 days at a European amusement parc. My parents, my sisters and their husbands and kids, and I also with husband and kids. My parents would never exclude one of us.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's odd that they didn't mention it.

You would not be the asshole for doing so.", "I\u2019d spend Xmas Eve with your mom and Xmas day with your dad and Easter on a cruise.", "Defo do Christmas and any other holidays without considering the others. Don\u2019t have to be nasty about it but do your own thing. As they did.", "NTA. I don't know why you would feel that you should spend time with those people. Let your husband deal with those people. Since they don't seem to care for you or your children, you need to make your own holiday plans, and a Disney cruise sounds like it could be fun. Live your lives and don't go out of your way for those people.", "While you are not wrong, your youngest won\u2019t remember a Disney cruise.  The three year old will have fun in the moment, but probably won\u2019t remember much of it either.   Yes, your husband should have a conversation with his parents, not to throw words, but to simply ask why you were excluded,  then the two of you can digest what they said and decide if it is a valid explanation or not.\n\nDon\u2019t let this ruin your thanksgiving.  (Because then they win).   Plan a small celebration, plan nothing, go do something fun with the kids for the day, even if it is a nice day at the play park.  Invite one or both of your parents and their significant other.   Invite a few friends who are alone for the holiday to join you.   It may be too late to plan a trip away for a few days.   \n\nthen decide how you want to go forward.    I refused to over exhaust the kids or myself, so one thanksgiving we spent with in-laws, the next with my family.   The same for christmas.   Yes, we got some pushback in the beginning, but we held firm and everyone adjusted.   \n\nYou live so close to your in-laws why only see them a few times a month?   Whose choice is that?  I totally understand the conflict of different parenting style, but those can be overlooked in an effort to stay close to each other.  Sometimes you have to agree to disagree.   I also understand overbearing parents and the need to limit exposure.   Does everyone else have a conflict with grandma and the way mom raises her kids?    Have you thought about setting a dinner date with grandma every week?   Suggest they come over for Sunday dinner at 5 every week?    I use to have a standing date with my grandson on Wednesdays, I\u2019d pick him up, we would go to the library and then have dinner.  He has so much fun, mom wanted to be included, and I said fine.   When the next baby came along, I asked grandson if he wanted his brother to be included in our Wednesday nights or would he like me to have library time with his baby brother on a different day?   He wanted us to all do it together.   Date night for 10 years so far.\n\nDo you want things to work, or are you happy with the separation?   If you are happy with the separation, you need to understand that your children will have a different relationship with their grand parents than the other grandchildren.   You can\u2019t protect your kids from all the hurts they will experience over the years.  They may have to accept that grandma does fun things with cousins, that they don\u2019t do with them.", "NTA. Take the Disney Christmas cruise with the kids. Invite the inlaws. Don't let the resentment and the exclusion take root. Rise above it right away.", "NTA\nHusband should talk to his parents. It could be as simple as your kids are too young. Personally, I think they would be, but they should have discussed it with you.\n\nIt's hard to be part of a transition generation between parents with different cultural values/expectations. Try to have patience with them while holding onto your values. A key to success will be you and your spouse being on the same page.", "We just found out this information today, so he has not had a chance to talk with them about it. We just saw every person mentioned in this post today, though - we invited all 9 of them over to carve pumpkins and decorate Halloween cookies with us. They all came and we had a really nice time. No one mentioned anything about a trip until everyone left and my single SIL stayed after to tell us. I do feel like if there was an understandable reason why our kids were excluded, she would have made sure to tell us. She seemed apologetic that we were not included.", "That's the part that makes me angry. It's fine if they are closer to their other grandkids, that happens and is understandable. I was closer to one set of grandparents than the other growing up, but it didn't mean I didn't love all of them. What's not ok is playing favorites so outwardly and going out of your way to make really special memories with some and no effort for the others. My kids are small now but if it gets to a place where they realize how differently they are treated and it hurts their feelings, that's unacceptable. \n\nMy parents are divorced but are both local to us as well, and we always see both of them and my ILs every Christmas Eve/Christmas. We have spent the past several Thanksgivings with my husband's family only and celebrated with my parents on alternate dates. Part of wanting to take the trip is to give my kids the experience they missed out on (and we have time off at Christmas, which would be convenient) but also to avoid the hurt feelings and resentment that will be inevitable now at the next holiday. In my mind, if I avoid the awkwardness at Christmas, then it won't ruin our favorite holiday with our little ones and we can save up that resentment for Easter, which feels like less of a loss, lol. I'm kidding but also kind of serious - obviously it should be addressed so we can move past it, I just don't want the difficult conversations to taint such a special time.", "Maybe he should first have a conversation with his sisters.", ">Is MIL trying to prove a point that cos she doesn't see your kids daily or isn't overly involved with them as she'd like to be, then they'll miss out? Cos, that's what it reads like.\n\nThanks for putting it into the words I couldn't find to describe how I'm feeling.", "And to his sisters. Why would they even go if he is not invited?", "Part of the reason why we would consider going at Christmas time is because Thanksgiving and Christmas are when we have time off from work. But you are right that the trip could wait until spring. \n\nI think I just am sad for my kids' sake and know that I will be extra sensitive to the favoritism at Christmas time now. My SILs family will be at Disney again for Christmas, so it will feel like my ILs will expect us to spend even more time there than usual since it'll be a quieter Christmas for them, and my kids shouldn't be the B team to fill in when the grandkids they go out of their way to make memories with are not available.", "Thanks for the thoughtful comment. You are right that we can't protect them from future hurt feelings or disappointment. It just feels wrong for that to come from their grandparents. While I certainly respect and understand that they are closer to their other grandkids, and that's ok, in my opinion showing the favoritism so blatantly is not kind to our kids. \n\nTo answer your question why we 'only' see them a few times a month - this feels pretty often to me. My husband and I both work, as do my ILs, and our kids are little so they go to bed early. We don't often do visits on weeknights (by the time my FIL gets home from work, we could visit for maybe 20 minutes before we'd need to leave to go home for bath time). On weekends, there's only so much time. We alternate between seeing family (my parents, divorced, and lots of other local family), play dates with our own friends and their kids, household chores, and the very occasional date night. I feel like if we can alternate everyone in at least every other weekend, that's balanced and fair. Some months, we see them 2-3 times but most months it's more than that because my husband's side has big family gatherings often. Pretty much all visits are initiated and coordinated by us.", "A few times a month nearly is every week. Grandparents should start counting their blessings. \n\nAlso, I think a family vacation for Christmas is a great idea, but the cruise probably is already booked. Have a plan B. Maybe something less expensive, because the kids won\u2019t remember it anyway lol.", "Would be interesting to see how much time the other families spend with them and if they are the daughters of the mother in law", "NTA . Go.\n\nYou wouldn't be the ah even if they hadn't decided to go with the rest of the family for Thanksgiving and leaving you out.\n\nYou your hubby and kids are a family unit and you decide for themselves.\n \nWhat mil+FIL did just liberated you from any feelings of guilt that you weren't spending the holidays with them\n\nThey are ah s and cowards for not having the cojones to tell you to your face. This cruise wasn't booked just now and they hid it", "NTA. Book the Christmas cruise and enjoy yourselves. If they bring it up or give you a hard time, just tell them that your kids heard about the other's trip (you see each other fairly frequently so I'm sure they will) and wanted to go themselves, so you decided that would be their Christmas present.\n\nI don't care what reason they come up with for leaving you out of the Thanksgiving trip, it's rude and wrong. As you said, if there was a valid reason, they'd have shared it.", "Its nive that she is apologetic towards you but also messed up she did dare/feel like telling har mum and dad that it is NOT okay to go on this trip with only 2 of their 3 kids invited. What kind of powerplay is MIL and FIL on and why don\u2019t the sisters stand up for their brother as a united front instead of just grabbing and all the goodies and saying sorry as they wave off.   \n\n\nDefinitely go on a cruise. Well hey why don\u2019t you book one here on Halloween now you don\u2019t have plans? Just show up on the same ship and have your own holiday.", "Time to stop going to the in laws. They want to see you let them make the effort - not saying you shouldn't visit occasionally when it's convenient to YOU and ok for them.", "Yeah, I see how hurtful that is. It does seem like a good idea to go over Christmas. It will be magical.", "Yes this. My MILs children spend far more time with their own mum than I spend with their mum. Just like I spend more time with my mum than my husband spends with my mum. \n\nI think the MIL needs to realise that her DIL will never see MIL like a bio-mum and needs to realise that DIL will never have the same close familial relationship with the MIL that MIL has with her own bio-daughters. This isn\u2019t a snub from the DIL, just normal family dynamics. \n\nThe fact that it seems MIL is happy to ostracise two of her own grandchildren because of some conflict she has with her DIL is unfair and incredibly childish. The children should never be any adults emotional punchbag.", "Yeah, exactly. They probably booked their cruise a good 6+ months ago."]}
