{"id": 29882, "submission_id": "17ivh7u", "title": "AITA for taking my kids on vacation for Christmas?", "selftext": "My husband and I (mid-30s) have been married for over a decade and have 2 kids (3 & 1.5). \n\nWe had a great relationship with his parents all throughout the time we were dating and married until we had our children. It's not bad now, but strained at times. My MIL is vocal that she doesn't agree with our parenting decisions and has been harsh about it. There's also a cultural aspect that I think has led to some hard feelings. My husband's culture is one where grandparents are extremely involved in day to day care of kids in the family, and my MIL has seemed offended that we are more independent. We make an effort for them to spend time with our kids, but it's never enough. We live 20 minutes away and see them a few times per month, sometimes more. \n\nMy in laws have 4 other grandkids, all from my SIL and all between 5-15 years old. My SIL's family has annual passes to Disney so they go often. This year they've been 4 or so times, and it's great that they are making memories with their kids. \n\nThe family knows that our kids are getting really into Disney lately. My husband and I have been talking about when is a good time for the kids' first Disney experience and thought maybe a Disney cruise would be good since they are too little for a lot of the rides at DW but can still meet the characters/ experience the magic.\n\nToday my husband's other sister let us know my in laws are taking her (single/no kids), other SIL/husband, and their 4 kids on a Disney cruise for Thanksgiving this year. She wanted us to know because the whole family will be gone for the holiday and she said she feels bad that we will feel left out. \n\nI am disappointed that my in laws could take 4 of their 6 grandkids on a big family vacation and not even invite the 2 youngest who are coming into prime Disney age. It's not about the money - my in laws are financially sound, as are we. We would not want or expect them to pay for our family to go (though they are paying for my SIL's family of 6), but to not be invited on a family vacation is hurtful. My 3 year old would be ecstatic about a Disney trip. \n\nI hurt for my kids, that they are left out. I hurt for my husband, who is wondering what he did wrong. And I am angry that they didn't feel bothered tell us themselves that they'll all be off together for Thanksgiving without us.\n\nNow the holidays feel awkward, and tbh I don't feel like making the effort for Christmas. I know we're not entitled to be included in someone else's vacation, but I can't help feel upset at the extreme favoritism. I'm thankful my kids are too young to see the pictures on SM, but it doesn't mean they won't hear about the trip from their cousins (to be fair, I'm really only referring to my 3yo, but he would be sad).\n\nWe've been talking about taking our kids on a Disney cruise anyways, so WIBTA if we said screw it, we're taking them for Christmas?", "created_utc": 1698554643, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ivh7u/aita_for_taking_my_kids_on_vacation_for_christmas/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This answer may clear up a bunch of confusion and resolve the issue.", "NTA\n\nFirst and foremost because nobody is entitled to you time on the holidays. With a young family it\u2019s worth trying out new traditions and seeing what works for you guys. That sounds like an awesome way to spend the holidays, and it doesn\u2019t have to be and insult to your in laws, you all can still celebrate together on a different day. \n\nAnd second because that\u2019s incredibly shitty of them to treat you and your kids like that. Just to skip inviting you all together is definitely saying something and I don\u2019t know how much time I would want to spend with people like that anyway. \n\nGo get your Disney cruise for Christmas and have a great time!", "NTA, but a conversation between your husband and his parents is warranted. Your kids are young and you don't want to set them up for a lifetime of exclusion. Try to nip this in the bud.", "NTA. You can plan trips for when you want, as the rest of the family has demonstrated.", "NTA-they make their decisions and y\u2019all make yours. If that means going on a cruise during Christmas, do what works for your family.", "NTA and nothing wrong with going on the Disney cruise over Christmas. But you might be depriving your kids the opportunity to participate in the extended families Christmas traditions out of spite.
