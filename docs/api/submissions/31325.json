I don\u2019t know the first thing about this digital influencer culture, but I like that she\u2019s happy creating her content. We went through a family tragedy when my first wife passed away 3 years ago, and I believe the dedication to her channels had a major positive impact on my daughter in a difficult time in her life.\r\n\nAnyway, whenever a company approaches her, I help the best way I can, going over the terms and conditions of contracts and so on. One thing that surprised me, though, is that some of those offers involve SERIOUS money, so I told my daughter from day 1 that I will put it all away for her so she can access her money when she turns 18. My view is that, for as long as she\u2019s a minor and unable to make more informed financial decisions, she should get by on her allowance, just as my other 2 children do.\n\nShe was fine with this at first, but lately she started asking me for more of her money. She pointed out that I allow my other daughter to keep and spend the earnings from her babysitting gigs. It\u2019s a ridiculous comparison because a teen having some pocket money from babysitting as a complement to their allowance doesn\u2019t even begin to compare to the kind of money my other daughter is making now. \r\n\nBut it\u2019s a fair point, and I gave her that. So I told her that we can use this as a reference: we could take an average of what her sister was earning with babysitting, or what her brother was earning flipping burgers in the fast food industry, or what most teenagers would realistically be expected to earn in this phase of life. I said I\u2019d agree to take a similar amount from her earnings every month so she could complement her allowance, but the bulk of it would still be put away until she turns 18. She thought I wasn\u2019t taking her seriously to propose something like that.

Otherwise, you\u2019re preserving her wealth as a parent should. Get her with you and go to an advisor and make a savings, investment, and spending plan where the plan \u2014 not your arbitrary limits \u2014 is the deciding factor of how much she can spend at any given time. That would seem the sensible approach.", ">I help the best way I can, going over the terms and conditions of contracts and so on.\n\nINFO: Are you a lawyer, in particular, one who has expertise in these kind of contracts?", "Im leaning YTA but not cause of money management. Your daughter makes a fair point, she earns more and it stands to reason she should have access to more. However, I completely see your point that giving a 15yo access to that kind of money isn't wise for her future. \n\nOn the other hand it seems like you're treating her with a double standard. You are letting her make adult decisions by being on social media and gaining a following/doing brand deals. Just like she is too young to be expected to manage a large sum of money, many would argue that she's too young to understand the implications of being an influencer on her future. A brand deal with the wrong company, saying the wrong thing once, could have a major impact on her future. So it seems weird to say \"I think my daughter's mature enough to make adult decisions about her social media presence that could impact her future but I don't think she's mature enough to manage money.\" If she's mature enough for one she's mature enough for both. If she's not mature enough for one is she really mature enough for the other?", "NAH. \n\nBut I think something more like a three-way split on her earnings would be more equitable. She makes more money and should therefore have more available to her. 33% is hers to spend, 33% for a college fund and 33% in a trust fund that she has access to at 18. You could even set payouts for the trust fund portion so it doesn't all come at 18, but increases her available to spend category.", "NAH. I don't think anyone is really the A here; that said, by tying the amount of money your daughter gets to her siblings' earnings you will be causing some tension between them that doesn't need to exist. You don't want her to be looking at brother Bob thinking if he only flipped more burgers I would have more spending money.\n\nI understand you not wanting her to have full access to her earnings as she'd likely learn bad spending habits, blow too much of the money, and so on. As she is earning the money though, I think she should get some of the reward from her success. I wouldn't tie it to her siblings at all, but perhaps try to work out what would be a bit more generous, but healthy amount for her to have access to each month and help her budget it out. You can still emphasize with her that the whole purpose here is to protect her money for her to have when she is an adult, to have her learn the value of money, and to teach her to make good financial decisions.", "NTA so far, but you have to keep talking. She does deserve to have some of that money now. And a 15 year old does need help managing large amounts of money, so you're not wrong. I think you need to let her propose how she wants it to work. If she's saying she wants all of it right now, then stick to your plan. But maybe she wants extra money for things that would help her make better content? What other teenagers make isn't the only reasonable measure of how much of her money she should have access to.", "I think she deserves more than what\u2019s based on the other children\u2019s babysitting jobs, etc. To have her feel rewarded for her hard work than feeling punished. It doesn\u2019t need to be a family discussion. It\u2019s best that she doesn\u2019t blow all she earns. But she should be able to splurge a bit. Maybe sit down with her. Show her the bank statements, whatever. Actually showing her what she\u2019s worth. And from there both of you come to a figure you can agree on. Maybe figure out what 10% at the time is and spread it out in 12 months of allowance. After a year figure out 10% again. This can teach her how to save and maybe even budget.", "Ehhh, I think you were way to strict with it to start and probably still are\n\nYou should have had a more open conversation/buy in than you leading.  \n\nJust controlling it until 18 then getting it all sounds like great way for it to poof spent on bday", "NAH. Handing over control of a massive wad of cash to your daughter on her eighteenth birthday is a disaster waiting to happen. Especially if she has 3+ years of resentment built up. You have to fix the relationship to ensure she doesn't self destruct. \n\nMaybe you can all take financial literacy courses together. All kids need to understand long term investing and money management. Your daughter is on her way to being a successful business person. Help launch her. \n\nYour other kids need the same info too.", "It's fine to limit her spending, but don't use her siblings as a metric.", ">So I told her that we can use this as a reference: we could take an average of what her sister was earning with babysitting, or what her brother was earning flipping burgers in the fast food industry, or what most teenagers would realistically be expected to earn in this phase of life.\n\nBut she's not sitting, or flipping burgers, or earning what an average teen does.\n\nI agree that she shouldn't be getting all of it at once, but you can't really teach her how to manage that money if she doesn't actually get to experience it.", "I understand where your worry is coming from but I want to point out exactly why what your daughter said is important.  I want you for the sake of my post to ignore how much she is making for 5 minutes. \n\nYour other two children have jobs. You don\u2019t control or access their money. You don\u2019t tell them they can only use a percentage of it. They are allowed full access to their paycheck.  Your 15 year old however does not have that same respect.  Yes the difference is that she earns more money than them.  \n\nHer job is not the old school typical teenage job.  Your other kids have those kinds of jobs.  So by allowing them full access to their fun money from their jobs but limiting your daughters it can come across as unfair and unsupportive.  Yes you help her navigate the bank stuff but you have access to the account. Is her account set up where you are automatically not authorized access once she turns 18.  \n\nThink of how many former child actors come out and talk about how their parents stole their money.  It originally started as it was too much for a kid to access so they said to save it.  However the parent had access to it and took money from the kid to pay for every thing the parent wants.  Managing money for kids with high amounts is a slippery slope.  Look into having a third party not a family member be trusted to give her access.", "I don\u2019t have any direct evidence but I\u2019m getting this premonition that you don\u2019t want her to squander her money because you\u2019re going to take it the first time you encounter a financial hiccup.  YTA", "YTA\n\nYour daughter is going to go no contact with you at 18.\nYou are also setting up your kids to have alot of tension between them by tying what she has access to of HER OWN EARNINGS based on what her siblings earn.\nYou are setting up massive family issues in the future", "I\u2019m split on this, so I\u2019d say you\u2019re kind of TA. She\u2019s the one making the money and putting forth all the work, so she should have access to some of it. If she\u2019s making a lot of money though, it does stand to reason that some should be put away for the future. If I had made big money at 15 I would have blown it all on stupid stuff and wished I\u2019d had some left when I got out on my own. I see your point in creating a nest egg for her future, but I think she deserves more than allowance/babysitting money if she\u2019s making considerably more. Maybe you can agree on a percentage she gets access to from each contract or paycheck, or a credit card with a low monthly limit and when that limit is reached she doesn\u2019t get any more until the next month. It could help teach her how to budget money. I\u2019d also suggest getting her to take a class or meet with someone who can teach her about managing money now and when she\u2019s out in the real world. That\u2019s something I desperately wish I\u2019d had before I was out on my own. I had to learn the hard way lol!", "YTA - It\u2019s her money. It\u2019d be one thing to teach her to budget, but there\u2019s a lot of you controlling her money, and *telling* her what she\u2019s doing. You should\u2019ve talked with your daughter from the beginning to make a financial plan; a set amount of savings and spending money.\n\n\u201cShe started asking me for more of her money\u201d is such a ridiculous statement to me. In no other scenario would it be right to withhold the money that someone has earned\u2026so it doesn\u2019t make it okay just because you\u2019re a dad and she\u2019s your daughter. That is ultimately her money, and while teaching her how to use it responsibly would be the best course of action, what she does with her money is ultimately her decision. Give her all the tools to make sound financial decisions *for herself* now, so she won\u2019t immediately blow her savings the day she turns 18.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be based on what her siblings make. It should be percentages based on what she has. Maybe it\u2019s save 60% and keep 40% for spending. Whatever the breakdown, it\u2019s something she definitely deserves a chance to set for herself.", "YTA. It's her money. If this were a regular paycheck, would you take her money and put it in an account to \"keep safe\"? If she doesn't want you accessing the money and putting it aside for her, then you have no right to do so.\n\nEdit to add: I strongly suggest you get a lawyer who can look over these contracts, which your daughter can pay for if these companies are truly giving her a lot of money for these brand promotions.", "NTA yet. She makes more and deserves more. Plus, what do the contracts entail? She may have business expenses that the other kids don't. They are never going to make the same amount of money as adults or even now, so the disparity in earnings shouldn't be an issue. She works for more and deserves more but the how much more should be decided jointly including her in the decision making process. Figuring a budget, etc. Good luck.", "NAH. I get where you\u2019re coming from but at the same time I would have been apocalyptic if my parents tried to control the money I made as a teenager.\n\nDo you feel she would be irresponsible with the money? Is it a massive life changing amount? For me I squandered maybe $10k traveling and in college just supplementing living expenses, but I also learned how to manage and be responsible for my own spending. Maybe she just needs guidance. I wonder if you butt in too much.. you say you don\u2019t know anything about what she does and you\u2019re not a lawyer so I wonder how helpful she feels you\u2019re really being in all of this. Are you knowledgeable about personal finances? Do you know how to invest in the stock market, do you manage your own accounts, etc.", "YTA.\n\nYou are withholding her money over something she has no control over which is how much her sister earns. What if her sister stops working? Is your other daughter supposed to not get any of the money she earned because of her sister's actions.\n\nIf you withhold money, do it because it benefits her...the person who earned that money. If she earns a certain amount, a percentage of that goes to savings/retirement fund. Then another percentage to cover costs of her operation. Then the rest is hers to do what she likes.", "YTA. \n\nShe's earning more than most teenagers by way of her knowledge of social media and ability to utilize those platforms. That's worth more than burger-flipping. This isn't devaluing minimum wage jobs, just acknowledging your daughter's acumen for the current economy. \n\nNow, yes, your daughter couldn't sign these contracts on her own. That doesn't mean that she isn't earning the money on her own-- just that you're allowing her to do it. \n\nI understand wanting to put some money away for savings, but I think the negotiation ought to start at a certain percentage of her profits, not what a minimum wage job would pay her. If 30% is well above minimum wage, she might settle for that. If not, 50% should still let you put away a fair amount for her future while letting her capitalize on her earnings as she makes them.", "YTA. It's her money, you should not be inhibiting her access to it.", "YTA. I didn\u2019t make serious money until I was 30 to learn important money skills. Your daughter has done that at 15 and if she has the ability and skills to MAKE it, you should\u2019ve trusted her ability to also learn how to manage it. Otherwise you\u2019re penalizing her for being successful and withholding the results of her work from her. I understand you want to teach her money skills but you can do that without cutting her incentives off. Don\u2019t take the easy shortcut out.", "Assuming your heart is in the right place- wanting to set your daughter up financially for the future - NTA. But, it should not be based on her siblings' earnings. I would advise hiring a financial manager for your daughter. Find someone who will help her think about her long-term finances and goals. A good one will also be able to help determine what purchases are tax deductible as part of being an influencer etc. She also needs to hire an attorney to look over her contracts.", "YTA I think some restrictions are reasonable to prevent a kid from blowing larger sums of money that they will later appreciate having for school or as an investment. But I think you are going about it the wrong way. Have you considered applying to all of your children a set of percentages? Such as a percentage for savings, a percentage for spending, a percentage for charity and so on? If she starts investing young, that could give her a wonderful advantage in life. Making it about the percentages teaches the principles of being responsible and limits the amount she can \u201cwaste\u201d but doesn\u2019t disincentivize her work or greatly limit your other kids\u2019 extra money either.", "NTA\n\nBut I guess you should try to talk to her again and find an amount of money to give to her, you both are comfortable with. In the end, it\u2019s not her fault, she earns more then her siblings.", "NTA. But I would suggest you to fund other luxuries for her(like expensive gadgets for her to function as an influencer and clothes) apart from her allowance from her fund. \nYou are doing a good job by keeping it aside for her as she is a minor but please don\u2019t ignore her basic rights as someone who is earning that money", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Who is paying their rent?  Who is buying their food?  Who is paying for electricity, internet?   Who is paying for their car and insurance? The only reason a teen is able to earn this money is because their parents are covering all of their other costs to support them.   \n\nI think it's natural for a teen to think they should be able to spend money they earn, and it's also natural for a parent to control it and make sure the money is not squandered.   So NAH", "NAH - but I think there's a lot you do need to consider. Using the money to make purchases for her business as an example, maybe you are already doing that. There really should be a business account too -not just taking it all as income is tax advantageous and if it's in your name instead of hers more of it is really going to taxes than necessary.\n\nShe should be able to see some rewards of her efforts now, so if she wants money to spend I would allow her access to more than what her siblings make, but would still have it within the range of teenage-job.

Your intentions are good. But the better thing to do would be to let her have all of her money and encourage her to use it wisely. She needs practice making wise financial decisions before she turns 18. Otherwise when she turns 18 and gets a ton of money all at once she is going to not know how to use it wisely. She's 15 not 5. She's likely mature enough to be able to make good decisions most of the time. Just ask her to run big purchases by you and if you disagree with her choice you can nudge her in the right direction but ultimately she's the one who earned the money and she has the right to waste it and learn from it now rather than later.", "YTA.

Here's my issue with this: the logic of saving X% and spending Y% is important for one's financial education, but it's twisted when it comes to teenagers . Because she's a minor. I support her, like I do my other children. I buy her clothes, I pay for food, I pay for electricity, I pay the mortgage. She doesn't have any basic spendings that would fall under \"spend\" percentage in such financial plans, so everything that falls under \"spending\" would be for superfluous reasons. It could create a habit where \"spending\" on a fancy dress is preferable to spending on rent. It takes basic needs out of the equation when you think about spending.", "That's my hang up. Yes teens can't always manage money well. But there have been many horror stories of parents dipping into their kids savings to be cautious.", "I\u2019ll take this comment as a chance to provide some additional information:\n\nAs a minor, she can\u2019t legally enter into a contract, so I have to be involved. If the money  is way above what I consider reasonable for a teenager to manage, I could simply shut it down before the contract is even signed. But I don\u2019t want her to miss these opportunities, and neither does she. So that\u2019s why we made this arrangement in the first place. The money comes directly into my account, and I keep records of every single transfer I instantly make to the account that was set in place for her. I also include her in any discussions with the financial advisor.\n\nSo yes, it's her money, and I never took a single penny out of it for my personal use, or to use towards our family. And the decision to put it away came not only as a measure to keep it safe, but also to keep her level-headed and grounded. I read that Emma Watson\u2019s parents gave her the same allowance they gave her brother, despite the fact she was earning millions while shooting the Potter movies. To make it clear, my daughter is FAR from earning Harry Potter money, but I see this case as a positive example: I don\u2019t believe a teenager should be allowed to access millions, or even tens of thousands of dollars; doing so would be giving too much autonomy to someone that still has some learning to do, and it could lead to unhealthy financial habits in the future. That's my opinion, at least.", ">She may have business expenses that the other kids don't.\n\nEverything that she ever needed for her career, such as better equipment and so on, was granted to her.

Your daughter is right it's not fair. If your going to let your other children keep the money they earn which is probably different from each other. And not let your daughter keep any of hers yes it would be unfair. Especially since you have decided it should go into your bank account and not a separate account for your daughter. Opening a savings account where MOST of her money goes and a bank account (if she doesn't already have one) where a percentage of the money goes makes more sense.", "The main issue is that its still her money that she is earning through her work. It might contractually be different than a regular job, but for all intents and purposes its still her money same as it would be if she was working with her brother flipping burgers. If you wouldn't set aside his money from his job, I don't see why its fair to do so for her. Yes it is substantially more money, but its still her earnings. Yes she could make stupid decisions with that money, but she can also still make those stupid decisions when she's 18 or 21 or 45. I think rather than arbitrarily restricting her based on her siblings incomes, you should sit down and talk with her about sound financial decisions - and trust that your daughter isn't going to go wild and spend all her money in a big rush. Put it in a savings account that she can access, which you can monitor, and let her do what she wants with it. If she wants to spend it all, well, its her money. \n\nI understand that you don't want her developing bad financial habits, that's totally fair. But you're also preventing her from developing good financial habits when the stakes are low. My mom did something similar to this with my sister, and I can tell you that the moment she turned 18 and gained access to her money she spent it all in a matter of weeks. She learned nothing from having it sit in an account with a tiny bit given to her every so often. It did nothing to teach her impulse control or health spending habits or anything related to that, because having a few hundred dollars put in her account every two weeks is not the same as having that big lump sum sitting there that you have to be smart and manage. \n\nHonestly I think the best thing you can do is ask her what she wants to do, while explaining that you're trying to figure out a way to teach her healthy spending. Trust that your daughter is a smart enough kid that she doesn't want to blow through a mountain of money and understands that it is important to save and budget. She's 15, not 5, and she should have a say in what is happening to her money especially when she has explicitly expressed the desire to do so.", ">Do your other children not use their income for the same superfluous reasons? I am assuming they do, they just have less to spend. This daughter has more to spend.\n\nIt depends. My son is saving up to buy a car; if he ends up buying an expensive pair of sneakers and that impacts on his goal, this will serve as a valuable lesson (IMO) to his financial decisions. I could think buying the sneakers was superfluous, I could even say something about it to teach him about discipline.\n\nBut if my daughter could buy a car with her 'spending' budget, the lesson here is that money will always be available and that saving up is irrelevant. That's why I believe context is everything, and giving too much financial power to teenagers (in a stage were today's cash flow aren't guaranteed in the future) is potentially dangerous.", ">OK why is it going into YOUR ACCOUNT? why not a savings account?\n\nIt's not my decision. Since my name is on those contracts, the companies demanded that the payments were made into an account that belonged to the signatory. Yet we have a somewhat amateurish operation because we weren't prepared for these kinds of offers, moving forward I'll look into other options for the money to be send to her account.", "It sucks for her that you have this leverage over her. Like what is stopping you from keeping the money? She has to worry about getting your approval that she is responsible enough at 18? What about capital gains and interest? I saw you hint in another comment how she doesn\u2019t pay rent etc and just wonder what types of doors you can open for yourself with that thinking.. eg im gonna take $5k to chip in to her college fund while my other kids didn\u2019t have to put any in.", "Do you transfer it into an account that is seperate from yours once you receive it? One that gives accountability and traceability for yourself and your daughter.", "I thought teen stars could have a proper trust that companies pay into. Something fishy here", "Open an account that is *just* for HER money that earns interest & also has *her* name on it. Having it in your account is opening it up to a lot of trouble.", ">Like what is stopping you from keeping the money? \n\nIf I was acting in bad faith, nothing. But as I said, we're looking into possibilities for the money never having to go through my account.\n\n>I saw you hint in another comment how she doesn\u2019t pay rent etc and just wonder what types of doors you can open for yourself with that thinking.. \n\nThere's no way you got that from my comment unless you're inclined to believe I'm acting in bad faith. I was referring about the balance between spending and saving up, and how it doesn't apply to a minor whose basic spendings are covered by their parents, as it should be.", "You need to contact a agency that handles influencers and set things up RIGHT. She should have a business and her own financial management, not just \u201cdad putting it into savings from his account.\u201d", "I\u2019m inclined to think from all angles because I don\u2019t know you. Your daughter doesn\u2019t really know you either, as a young adult and in a business context. My issue reading this is that you are just figuring this all out yourself but are also the Grand Arbiter of all that is and should be. And that is naturally going to cause conflict with someone who may arrive at good faith disagreements with you. You haven\u2019t really explained or displayed knowledge in law or finances to justify your position, and your remaining ignorant about digital influencers is not a good sign that you are putting in the time to understand what she does for all the control you want over it.\n\nYou need to let her take the lead and make your decisions from there imo. If she is coming at you wanting to spend $100k on a sweet 16 then alright pump the brakes. If she is doing anything semi responsible then get out of the way and offer input but let her lead.", "Having a lawyer who does contract law is a better choice than one of those agencies. Agencies take a high percentage & a lot of influencers have had trouble with their agencies stealing from them or causing trouble with other creators. A lawyer is a safer bet in this case imo.", "I think the horror tales of parents that spent their children\u2019s earnings mostly come from situations where the parents were seeing their children as breadwinners and these parents\u2019 entire lives revolved around the child star. That\u2019s not the case because, up until recently, I didn\u2019t even think her social media channels would be profitable, and because I\u2019m perfectly able to support the household, and because I didn\u2019t quit my day job to become her manager. \n\nEstablished influencers have started companies under their names, and they can get hired under their own businesses. There\u2019s a possibility to start a company for my daughter, so the money will go straight to this account, but we didn\u2019t even know this would be a requirement until recently, because we weren\u2019t expecting to get deals from established companies. So there\u2019s an innocent reason for the money being transferred to my account, because she can\u2019t enter into a contract herself as a minor, and I\u2019m the signatory.\n\nIt's still not ideal, but it is what it is so far.", "I guess my main point is that she needs more input into how things work, including your role which she should agree to. It sounds like she agreed you have a role to play, let an agreement about that guide you. Maybe she needs your help identifying who helps with what.. who do we talk to about incorporating, who is a legit financial advisor, and so on. But maybe she doesn\u2019t need you to be the CEO deciding every what happens and when. Akin to something called servant leadership you can read more about"]}
