Every few year they go somewhere else.\n\nI called my youngest last night and she put me on speaker phone, like she usually does. I overheard my ex saying that this year they were not going to Colorado, and needed to decide where to go. (She didn't know I could overhear her, I don't think she even knew I was on the phone.) So her and the kids were just yelling back and forth at each other ideas of where to go. Then my oldest said, can we get 2 hotel rooms this year! We are getting to big to share! So ex yells back yeah, there are 5 of us. it's not like we fit in one room. Plus we are going to have to rent a Van or a bigger car. This yelling back and forth normal for them instead of sitting down and having a normal discussion everyone just talks as loud as possible across the house.\n\nI ask the youngest, who is going with them, since there is just the Ex and 3 kids. she says, Josh, ex's fianc\u00e9. Who else would be going? I just say ok, and continue to talk to my daughter.\n\nShe refuses to let me meet this man and said that when I decide to be a real father and are part of the kids life I can meet him, until then nope. They also don't live together as my ex's house is too small and are waiting until she moves into a new house later this year.\n\nI have not seen the kids in person except 3 times in the past 4 years because, I can't drive and I am disabled. I still have 50/50 legal custody and am supposed to have them 2 overnights a week. She makes all the decisions and basically leaves me out of everything.\n\nI call my ex later and tell her that, I don't agree that her fianc\u00e9 should be going on vacation with the kids and that I find it inappropriate. She again tells me when I can step up and be a real parent, and see the kids, be a real part of their lives other than a phone call to play fortnight, and pay child support. Then I can have an opinion until, I don't get a say. I told her that I would be seeing her in court if she didn't agree not to take him with them. She just laughed and hung up.\n\nI then called the kids and told them, that I didn't want them to go on vacation with mom's boyfriend. They all said he went last year to Colorado and he's a nice guy. My son (16) told me \"Sorry, you suck so much that you can't find anyone\"\n\nI am contacting an attorney today to see about stopping her from taking the fianc\u00e9 with them and possibly stopping him from living with them until they are at least married. This is an expense I really can not afford, but will have to find a way. She on the other hand has an attorney paid by her brother.\n\nI have run this by a few friends and they all say I am the asshole because, I don't deal with the kids in their day to day life and whoever this dude is, is part of their day to day life and from what the kids he's a good guy. \n\nMy family on the other hand thinks that I am doing the right thing, as I should have say in my kids life!", "created_utc": 1674501955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jl0mq/aita_for_trying_to_stop_a_vacation_my_ex_is/", "score": 2234, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But you don't do anything to actually get that 50/50 custody? Sure, you've got it on paper, but not in reality. You've seen your own children only 3 times in the last 4 years. That's insane. You need to step up as their father, because you're not doing a great job right now. I understand that things are harder because of you being disabled and unable to drive.  But there's public transport. Hell, maybe you could even get an attorney to make it so that your ex has to drop the kids off at your place and then pick em back up when they go to her place again. Your priority should be your children, not your ex's boyfriend (who has clearly been in the picture for a while now).\n\nPlease, please, for your children's sake, do better.\n\n\nETA: Just read in the comments that you only live 5 miles away from them. The fact that, even though you live so nearby, you have only seen your children 3 times during the last 4 years is absolutely insane. Makes me agree with your ex even more. And then you DARE complain that's she's bringing her boyfriend of at least a year to this trip. You need to get your priorities straight, or you're just gonna lose your kids. You're absolutely failing them with the way you're doing things now.\n\nETA 2: You're not even payong child support. So: You don't put in any effort for your children, you won't even travel 5 fucking miles to their mom's home, you do not pay child support, and you see them less than once a year. And yet you expect to have a say in your children's lifes AND their mom's life? You're an absent father, you don't even try to be present in your childrens' lifes yet you expect to have any input in things that have absolutely nothing to do with you whatsoever. Man, if you take this to court, I bet you'll lose your 50/50 custody agreement, trading it in for less or likely no custody whatsoever.", "Sorry if I missed it in the post but why do you find it inappropriate? There is a lot of text on how the situation came about but you didn\u2019t really say why its your position? Why can\u2019t your ex have a relationship with her fianc\u00e9? Why are you trying to stop him living with them until they are married?", "YTA.\n\nThese are two completely separate issues, and you are hurting your kids with both.\n\nFirst, you don't explain WHY you haven't had your kids for your 2 overnights per week.  I'm going to guess that it's because you are responsible for  half of transport and your ex doesn't want to deliver them and pick them up.  I understand if you can't drive, but then you should be offering some other solution rather than let it go for years at a time.\n\nSecond, you have absolutely no standing in who your ex goes on trips with, unless your agreement has a \"morality\" clause in it.  This \"Josh\" is a part of your kid's lives on at least a weekly basis, and there's no way a judge will rule that the trip is different than the rest of their lives.\n\nIf you want to spend money on a lawyer, spend it to get your proper visitation enforced, not this side-show about vacation.", "I N F O - how far away do you live from your ex and the kids?\n\nWhy are you trying to control their lives when you\u2019re not even present in them?\n\nHow old are your kids? You mention your son is 16 so even if you decide to go to court he\u2019s able to decide whether he wants to see you or not.\n\nEdit - **YTA**, you live 5 miles away but have only seen your kids 3 times in four *YEARS*. No wonder your ex is mad you haven\u2019t made any effort at all to be a part of your kids lives, and they can see that. Mind ya business and let the kids enjoy their holiday with their soon-to-be step dad and mum.", "YTA \n\n>I have not seen the kids in person except 3 times in the past 4 years because, I can't drive and I am disabled.\n\nThis doesn't actually explain why you haven't seen them. If you have 50/50 custody they should be coming to wherever you live and you don't have to drive for that. Your ex doesn't even need to be the one driving.\n\nYou said they live 10 miles away so there's no reason why you can't take public transportation or the kids can't. Or your family who supposedly agrees with you can't help. \n\n\n>I told her that I would be seeing her in court if she didn't agree not to take him with them.\n\nSo you can't see your kids who are 10 miles away but you can go to court? Sure Jan.", "How can you afford an attorney to disrupt your ex's life but you can't afford to get your kids to you more than once every 16 months or so? It's your job as their parent  to make an effort. But you only seem to do so when you want to be difficult.  You want a say in your kids' lives but where are you in their lives? Nowhere to be seen. YTA.", "Go ahead and try to take it to court. It sounds like you're not paying child support and I don't think the court is going to like knowing that. And throwing out that you're disabled is bullshit because disabled parents are active in kids lives everyday. You want the say of a 50-50 parent agreement without the responsibility. You make no effort to see your children other than playing online video games with them. That's not parenting. YTA", "INFO.  You don't get to control her life. \n\nYou do have a say with your kids due to a court mandated 50/50 split but apparently aren't exercising that right (to see your kids 2x's a week due to your condition).  \n\nAnd you don't pay child support.\n\nWhat part of your situation is actually her fault?", ">I have not seen the kids in person except 3 times in the past 4 years because, I can't drive and I am disabled. I still have 50/50 legal custody and am supposed to have them 2 overnights a week?\n\nYTA. So why haven't you been seeing them? I'm surprised your ex hasn't gone back to court to get full custody.\n\nRegardless, her fianc\u00e9 isn't your affair. Unless you suspect some kind of abuse or dangerous situation with him, then you're wasting time trying to keep him out of their lives.", "YTA, 3 times in 4 years is how much you've seen them? And yet you are SO entitled, just wow. You're disgusting.", "Please contact a lawyer. Go to court. Show up. That way your ex wife and children can see how easy it is for you to show up WHEN YOU WANT TO!  YTA.  It\u2019s embarrassing that you even posted this.", "YTA. There\u2019s no excuse in the world to have only seen your kids 3 times in the past 4 years. Your work is cut out for you OP", "INFO: does this say you are or aren't paying child support?", "YTA\n\nAside from the whole new BF issue, you are ruining your kids vacation because you are mad at your Ex/jealous of her new BF... why should they lose out on the vacation over something that they have no control over?  Especially when all indications are that he is a nice guy and they want to go on the vacation.  \n\nSince you aren't in the position to take them on a vacation yourself, you should be happy that someone is and they are getting to have some fun.", "YTA, as your ex says, if you want to have a say in their lives then step up, get involved and start getting to know your kids, that isn't just sticking your nose in and stopping someone else get close to your children because you're insecure.", "So... you only saw your kids 3 tiles in the last 4 years, even if they only live 5 miles away. This means they have seen your ex wife's new partner way more than they have seen you. He's probably more of a father to them than you are.\n\nYet it wouldn't be appropriate if he went with them on a holiday? \n\nOfcourse YTA. Maybe stop making excuses and start acting like a dad if you want to be able to make any decisions for them.", "YTA.\n\nSo you can't see your kids because you are disabled, but you're somehow going to be able to retain a lawyer and show up at court for this ridiculous battle?\n\nLet's be honest here, OP. You have no want to actually be a father, but now that some other man is around, you feel the need to piss on your ex and kids like a dog marking his territory. Your ex is 1000% correct with what she said. You've chosen not to be a parent. You don't get to dictate who's a part of their lives and who they go on vacation with.", "Seeing your kids 3-4 times is major deadbeat status.\n\nYou said you have a disability. Do you not have family who can help you get your kids  from their moms and over to your house to spend some time together? At least once a week? They live 10 minutes from you for gods sake. \n\nForget your ex and forget her boyfriend. Get your shit together and try to be in your kid\u2019s life because they\u2019ll remember you not being a father. And no amount of lawyers or fortnite is going to give them true quality time with their father. Get your priorities straight my dude.", "YTA. Dude, you don't even pay the child support? Like, seriously, that's the bare minimum. She is right, you do need to take more responsibility for your kids.", "YTA. Take that money you would spend on an attorney and use it on Ubers to spend time with your kids!", "YTA.\n\n1.It sounds like your kids are old enough that they complain if the fiance is mistreating them.  You could gently ask them.\n\n2.  Why don't you see your kids?  Did she move away from your or vice versa?  Maybe too late to complain.   Do you have no one to help you visitation?  A relative of yours?   I know uber is not supposed to take minors, but where I live there are car services that specialize in transporting minors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT -- she lives close, YTA.  Why can't your family help", "YTA - as long as you don't pay or take the kids 50/50, you should suck it up.", "A lawyer will take your money. The judge will then ask, why you have money for  the lawyer but no money for child support.", "Sorry, YTA. Your ex should be following th custody agreement to the kids see you but it is also not her responsibility to bring the kids to you. If you're not finding a way to see them more often that's on you. You don't get to dictate your exes relationships. This isn't some random dude, she's engaged to him and clearly he's been in the picture for a while. If you try to restrict this your kids will likely be resentful towards you. It sounds like they have more of a fatherly relationship with the fianc\u00e9. I would agree about contacting a lawyer to enforce visitations but you have no right to tell your ex who she can vacation with. And if there's no cause for concern for the safety of your kids you don't have the right to say when she can move with or marry this man.", "YTA. That's all I can say. Getting an attorney would be a waste of money. Spend the money on getting to know your kids better.", "YTA. You're an adult and are the one who has to step up and find a way to meet the responsibilities to your kids. You are the one using your disability as a reason to get out of paying what you owe your kids and contributing to their lives. Why would your kids care about your opinion? You also don't get to dictate your ex's relationships. She can choose to move in with who she wants. If there is a legitimate reason to worry about their safety, then you can weigh in, but until then, you're basically an absent parent.", "YTA it seems you are hardly involved in your children\u2019s lives and are making excuses because you don\u2019t drive and are disabled.

Sorry, but you don't get to stop her from including her fianc\u00e9 in the lives of the kids that she has 100% of the time. On paper you have 50/50, but you do nothing to actually spend time with them, that's on you.", "YTA \n\nYes, go to court. You aren't seeing your kids at all, let alone the 50/50 custody you agreed to. You are going to lose all custody. You don't care to be involved in their lives, so you don't get to make decisions for their lives. \n\nThis man is going to be their stepdad. You can't block that. You don't even act like a father.

If u wanna keep in touch with your kids, take a god damn taxi to see them. Ask ppl to drive you/pick them up.

Rented a place, used benefits, and got rid of the depression. \n\nMy ex wouldn't let me see my kid. Found out all the cards I sent never made it him. Took another year of eating Ramen while I used every penny I had and could borrow to go to court to get basic visitation. I won.

If she is preventing you from seeing your children, then that's one thing, but it sounds to me like you aren't seeing them because you aren't making the effort to see them on your end. I'm sorry that you have a challenge with your disability, but you are willingly giving up your visitation with your children, and there is no excuse for that. There is Uber, friends and family help, public transportation, paid drivers, etc. You CAN find a way to have your kids during your visitation time, you just haven't made it a priority in your life.

Figure out how to make it happen.\n\nYour family is right - you SHOULD have a say in your kids life, but you haven't done the right things to make sure that you do. You haven't kept up with your obligations. You are focused on your ex-wife's new BF, but he doesn't seem to be a problem for anyone except you.

I don't know how on earth you managed to get 50/50 custody when you are not physically able to take care of the kids independently, but it shouldn't  have happened, and the courts should be notified of the real custody arrangement. And you should be paying child support. Edit: I should address the issue at hand. I understand that your disability limits your involvement, but there's no reason for a person who isn't involved in the kids day to day lives to make this kind of decision unless there's reason to believe the other parent isn't coming back.

Every few year they go somewhere else.\n\nI called my youngest last night and she put me on speaker phone, like she usually does. I overheard my ex saying that this year they were not going to Colorado, and needed to decide where to go. (She didn't know I could overhear her, I don't think she even knew I was on the phone.) So her and the kids were just yelling back and forth at each other ideas of where to go. Then my oldest said, can we get 2 hotel rooms this year! We are getting to big to share! So ex yells back yeah, there are 5 of us. it's not like we fit in one room. Plus we are going to have to rent a Van or a bigger car. This yelling back and forth normal for them instead of sitting down and having a normal discussion everyone just talks as loud as possible across the house.\n\nI ask the youngest, who is going with them, since there is just the Ex and 3 kids. she says, Josh, ex's fianc\u00e9. Who else would be going? I just say ok, and continue to talk to my daughter.\n\nShe refuses to let me meet this man and said that when I decide to be a real father and are part of the kids life I can meet him, until then nope. They also don't live together as my ex's house is too small and are waiting until she moves into a new house later this year.\n\nI have not seen the kids in person except 3 times in the past 4 years because, I can't drive and I am disabled. I still have 50/50 legal custody and am supposed to have them 2 overnights a week. She makes all the decisions and basically leaves me out of everything.\n\nI call my ex later and tell her that, I don't agree that her fianc\u00e9 should be going on vacation with the kids and that I find it inappropriate. She again tells me when I can step up and be a real parent, and see the kids, be a real part of their lives other than a phone call to play fortnight, and pay child support. Then I can have an opinion until, I don't get a say. I told her that I would be seeing her in court if she didn't agree not to take him with them. She just laughed and hung up.\n\nI then called the kids and told them, that I didn't want them to go on vacation with mom's boyfriend. They all said he went last year to Colorado and he's a nice guy. My son (16) told me \"Sorry, you suck so much that you can't find anyone\"\n\nI am contacting an attorney today to see about stopping her from taking the fianc\u00e9 with them and possibly stopping him from living with them until they are at least married. This is an expense I really can not afford, but will have to find a way. She on the other hand has an attorney paid by her brother.\n\nI have run this by a few friends and they all say I am the asshole because, I don't deal with the kids in their day to day life and whoever this dude is, is part of their day to day life and from what the kids he's a good guy. \n\nMy family on the other hand thinks that I am doing the right thing, as I should have say in my kids life!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They seem to like the fiance, they live with the fiance (whether you know him or not), and spend more time with the fiance than with you. Is this right? Probably not - I actually agree that you should have been introduced to the fiance before your ex brought him into their lives. But you can't undo what has already been done and what is best for your children is not to deprive them of a vacation they want, that they've already been on before with this man, regardless of whether you know him or not.\n\nAs a disabled person, myself, I do sympathize with the difficulty managing things - I don't know what your disability is, but I do everything in my power to see my kids - whom I'm not even biologically related to - as often as possible. I talk to their mothers more than my husband does, I talk to them on the phone every chance I get (without impeding on their time talking to their dad, of course), and I make plans for us to be able to do things outside of court-ordered custody/visitation time, by having a half-decent relationship with their moms.\n\nThat you can't be arsed to do anything to actually see your kids, you apparently don't pay any child support, and you think a lawyer is going to help you, what...stop your ex from moving on? This seems to be a power play to try to control her, because this definitely isn't about the kids, at this point. If it was about the kids, you would be doing everything you could to see them as often as possible, you would be fighting for every minute you get to spend with them, and you would have brought up your concerns about meeting her fiance WELL before it got to the point of him being a fiance.\n\nThere are definitely women and men out there that purposefully hide their SO's from their coparents (I'm dealing with one of those people right now, actually, but this isn't about me and my situation), and I'm not saying your ex didn't do that, but at this point, that time has past. If there are no concerns about abuse - and there don't seem to be - it's time to just bow out and let them have a parent who wants to be around them.\n\nDon't waste money on a lawyer, especially if you're not paying your child support.

He never even gave a viable reason for this new man not to go. Just simply didn\u2019t want to see another man picking up his slack without complaint.", "If you\u2019re going to tell me they are different can you please explain what you mean? In my divorce I had full custody so no one spoke of that. \n\nMy assumption is that if you\u2019re at dads, he pays for all your stuff then and Visa versa splitting other expenses.", "> I *completely* forgot about the fact that he technically still has 50/50 custody.\n\nHe doesn't, he has 50/50 *legal* custody. Mom has primary physical custody, if she's supposed to have them 5 nights a week and he's supposed to have them 2.", "Op says 50/50 legal. At least where I am, in PA, legal custody is not the same as physical. Just means they have joint decision making power about school and such", "Yea if he goes back to court, the oldest two are old enough to decide who they want to live with. The youngest might be too and it sounds like he doesn\u2019t even attempt to have a relationship with any of them. He\u2019d end up with no custody and a lot of child support debt.", "What difference does it make that he has 50/50 custody, he clearly doesn't care to see the kids so why should the wife waste your money going to court to make it legal.\nI'm not even sure what the problem is with the boyfriend/ fiance (except but he exists, makes the ex happy, and makes the kids life easier).\nIt this post even real? How could this guy think he's notthe A-hole?\nYTA, so so much!", "Well, that\u2019s not fair. He does *at least* 0.05%! He saw them a whole three times in the last four years. /s", "Yeah I started this post thinking he was worried cause she was taking them to Mexico or something", "I've never had kids and didn't know that. Interesting.\n\nI'm actually also in Canada.", "Not a lawyer, American, or someone with kids.\n\nProbably.", "Yeah the kids don't seem enthused to spend time with him either, or else they'd be begging their mom to drop them off or get them an uber or something. The oldest is 16, he can travel on his own at this point and chooses not to, just says dad sucks and he likes the soon to be step-dad.", "Where I am 50/50 legal custody means both parents have equal say in decisions - medical, education, etc. If the child, for example, wants to play a sport, both parents have to agree to it. To have 50/50 legal, you don't have to have 50/50 physical custody, which is half-time at each parent's house. \n\nI have primary custody (father has every other weekend) and 50/50 legal custody. OP says he has 50/50 legal but only has partial custody, which he doesn't exercise since he doesn't see his kids. Does that make sense?   \n\n\nAs for child support, I don't really know how that works. I know divorced doctors who have 50/50 legal and physical custody, and the father still pays the mother child support.", "Child support is based on physical custody--who has the kids. If one parent has them more, other parent pays. Legal is about decision-making.", "Canadian here as well. It depends on income and assets. If both parents are working and making about the same, 50/50 will mean no support. If there's a huge income disparity, the higher income parent may be ordered to pay some support to the other parent.", "In 50/50 physical custody, if one parent makes significantly more than the other then that parent has to pay parity CS that would make their income equal.", "Thank you for explaining it to me :) I have read so many different things from people that I had no idea"]}
