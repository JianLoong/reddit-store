I was raised an only child by a single mother, dad was never in the picture as he left my mum and married someone else when she was still pregnant with me. Recently, I did one of those commercial DNA tests out of curiosity and matched with one of my half-brothers. It was a crazy day. We set up a meeting the same day we matched with each other on the site, and I met all 4 of my siblings. We spoke about my dad and how he's \"dying\" to meet me. One of my brothers asked if he could give my dad my number and I said ok even though I was anxious beyond words. My dad reached out to me and we met in person for the first time a few days later.\n\nThat was all a month ago. Truth be told, I am still trying to get used to having a dad and siblings. It's overwhelming. I went my whole life not needing a dad, only having my mum and being absolutely fine with it because she was both parents wrapped up into one and now I suddenly have a dad and it's like I don't know what to do with that. I'm still angry with him for the way he treated my mum, the way he tossed her aside and married someone new. This wouldn't be happening if I hadn't decided to do a dna test on a whim, right? When I asked him about everything - why he left my mum, why he never tried to form a relationship with me until now etc - his answer was along the lines of \u201cI had my reasons.\" No accountability.\n\nNow he seems to be working overtime to \"make up for lost years\" (his wife's words, not mine) He's buying gifts every other day, offered to take my siblings and I on holiday, he's setting up a bedroom for me in their house so that I can stay over any time I want. Through all this, I'm still the same overwhelmed, anxious girl that first met him only a month ago and is still trying to adjust to everything. My mum is ok with it all and is very supportive, but I still feel guilty, as though I'm somehow betraying her when I interact with him.\n\nNow to what has made me feel like an AH - I have a groupchat with my siblings now where I interact fairly regularly, but I don't text my dad often. I also have yet to tell him I love him. It feels like it's too soon, something very significant that I can't say yet. my little sister (9 yrs old) will say \"| love you daddy!\" and he'll look at me and say \"can't wait to hear those words from you, (my name)\" or \"when will I hear that from you, (my name)?\" it makes me feel awkward.\n\nToday I woke up to a text from him: \u201cI feel like if I don't reach out to you first, you won't contact me at all. It feels like I'm putting in effort and am met with radio silence. Please let me know what more I can do.\" His wife also reached out, telling me he's upset and feels like our relationship is one-sided and that since his birthday is coming up I have an opportunity to patch things up.\n\nThis made me feel like shit and I still haven't told anyone about it. I feel like a month isn't long enough for me to forget the past 23 years.

The audacity. NTA and your \"dad\" sounds like a loser for guilt tripping you. He needs to gain some humility and understand he's lucky to have you in his life in any form.", "NTA. You need time to deal with all this and digest the newly created bond with your siblings and father, and it doesn't seem like it's being acknowledged or respected. It seems like he's trying to make you go at the pace he wants to set, the pace he thinks is the right one, not the pace that is actually right for you. Maybe talk to him to actually make this clear, so he knows you're willing to give this a bond a chance to thrive, but that you need time to adapt to it.\n\nAlso, who the hell does this lady thinks she is, telling YOU, the one who got left behind by your father, that YOU have an opportunity to patch things up ? That's a real AH-ish thing to say.", "NTA. This guy is a complete stranger!!! And he\u2019s trying to impose himself on your life.

Sounds to me like your father is guilt tripping you. It is fine if you don't feel love for him straight away or even not at all. At this point in time, your father is no better than a stranger or at most acquaintance for lack of better word. If you ever decide to accept your father, you won't be betraying your mom. Your mom is supportive of you to decide what you want in life. Relationship isn't an instant thing despite him being a biological father. It takes time and trust.", "NTA.\n\nThis guys only just appeared in your life. In real time terms he's barely just got out of \"stranger\" territory.\n\nIt sounds like your father is love bombing you with all the gifts, almost like he's trying to make up for lost time... or worse its just a cynical way to win you over.\n\nIf you're able to have a conversation with him and say how this is difficult for you, you might be able to get him to take a step back and let the relationship develop naturally. At the moment it sounds like he's pushing for developments way too fast.\n\nLove isn't something you can just activate by blasting someone with kindness, no matter how pure the intention.", "NTA - I think you and your dad have different ideas of what's happening here.  You wanted information and possibly closure.  Oh hey, new family members, cool, but you're an adult with your own life.  They are on the periphery of that life.  \n\nYour dad seems to want to play happy family and have you be a DAUGHTER.  I mean, he made a bedroom for you at his house, when you're a 23yo stranger who has only met him a handful of times.  His goals and expectations are pretty unrealistic, especially since he's not giving you the information or closure you wanted.\n\nYou might need to just talk to him and point out that you are moving on your own timeline, and not his.  It's been 23 years that you and your mom have done this without him.  You're happy to know him, but the relationship that you have with him should be on YOUR terms, not his.  He lost all rights to dictate what that relationship should be when he left your mom.\n\nOut of curiosity, how is your mom handling all of this?  Please don't get so wrapped up in your new family that you accidentally neglect her.  This has got to be really difficult for her.", "NTA. No healing can even begin until he accepts responsibility for his actions.", "NTA. He had 24 years to get to love you. You need 24 years from now to decide if you need this shit.

And now this shitty ignorant couple (yes, his wife too) is trying to make you guilty for not loving him instantly. WTF!", "Nta. Wtaf? None of this is on you. He made the relationship one sided and now he's projecting that onto you? I'm sure it makes him feel better but also shows he's the same prick who left you.

You just need time, and your dad need to take his reponsability and understand the situation too.

He's your biological dad, yeah, but he's never been your parent who raised, loved and supported you. You are an adult and can make your own judgements about his character. He can't buy your love with presents and promises and he's going overboard trying. This may be through guilt or whatever or it could also be because he's a manipulative piece of work who abandons a pregnant woman. Time will tell and you have every right to take this in your own time and on your own terms.", "NTA. You've had no relationship with him your entire life, he didn't even reach out to you until you tracked his new family down. He hasn't earned a better relationship and doesn't deserve one if you don't want to give it. He just wants you to tell him he doesn't need to feel guilty for being a shitty deadbeat dad.", "Nta. This jerk ignored the fact he has a child for 23 years and is accusing you of not putting in enough effort? No. Just no. Go at whatever pace makes you comfortable - if you want to talk to him at all. He owes you more of an explanation that he had his reasons.", "NTA.  No one can force feelings of love for another.  It only builds resentment.  Him expecting you to love him after 23 years of NC is ridiculous.  The fact that he refuses to even discuss his abandonment of you is also telling.  He needs to understand that his expectations of you are unhealthy.  Tell him flat out how you feel, and what his pressures on you are effecting you negatively.  You also need to tell him that he needs to answer your questions if he wants to move forward with a relationship with him.  Tell his wife she needs to stay out of it.", "NTA\n\nWhat on earth? You went 23 birthdays without hearing from him.\n\nIf you are still curious, maybe you could reply to them both at once with something like the following\"\n\n*\"I feel like there is a wall between us that will never come down until you can give me some honest answers about why you left my pregnant mother and why you never tried to be in my life for 23 years.

I feel very uncomfortable that you were fine with not knowing me for 23 years, only met me because I did a DNA test, and now you put it on me to \"patch things up\" and \"make an effort\".

Most probably, he didn't want kids with your mom and also didn't want to pay.   At 23 He's escaped that so now can magnanimously accept you.  He's trying to appear loving & generous now, under conditions that you obey and immediately blend in.  NTA.
