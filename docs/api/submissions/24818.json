We'll call him Tim. Despite a 16 year age difference, we'd gotten along well.\n\nUntil we started dated. I quickly learned that Tim's idea of a good time included gaslighting me to the point that I questioned my own sanity, screaming at me an inch from my face while I calmly asked him to stop and then lowering his voice and asking why I was yelling at him when I'd finally react, and ignoring me for days on end after a fight that he single handedly started - just to name a few. I had a one year old at the time from a previous relationship and I was still cordial with her father and his older kids. We tried to do something together as a family in the community one weekend a month, for the sake of the kids, and Tim always had an open invitation but never came. If I dared be anywhere but at Tim's side or sitting on his couch waiting for him to come home, then I was grossly accused of cheating - \"out playing with swinging dicks\", to be exact.\n\nA few years before we began dating, Tim was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. He fought it and ultimately won, but there was discussion of needing an organ transplant at that time. I got tested - I was a match and candidate as a living donor. Ultimately, he wound up not needing a transplant at that time and was in remission throughout our relationship.\n\nI finally broke off communication with him once and for all a little more than a year ago, and it has truly been the best decision I have ever made.\n\nLast week, I was contacted by Tim's brother, who I've kept in contact with (he was always good to me and acknowledged that how his brother acted was not okay) sporadically, telling me that Tim now desperately needs a transplant and asked if I would donate.\n\nI gave it alot of thought, but declined. I was recently diagnosed with PTSD from my pregnancy (kiddo is now 4.5 years old) and that has left me a tremendous amount of anxiety regarding my health/medical procedures. Additionally, I have an autonomic nervous system disorder which is known to frequently worsen after any kind of physical/mental trauma that we've only JUST managed to start getting under control. And, ultimately, it is major surgery. I am the primary caregiver to my daughter, as well as a 5 year old foster child. They need me here and at 100%.\n\nI guess word has gotten out, because I've been contacted by several of our old mutual friends telling me that if they had the option to donate to save his life, they would, and I should, too. They're also telling me what a great guy Tim is - which, honestly, I thought too until I entered into a romantic relationship with him. His brother has also begged me. Their father is long gone and they lost their mom a few years ago - his brother is the only family he has left.\n\nAll these messages are making me question AITAH?\n\nEdit: I don't think that Tim necessarily *asked* his brother to reach out to me. Nevertheless, Tim is in a position of authority where he oversees 500 people at his job and they all adore him - many of those guys were mutual friends. I do know several have gotten tested. They are apparently talking in terms of weeks before a transplant would no longer be a viable option at all. Hearing alot of \"put the past in the past, everyone deserves to live\".", "created_utc": 1692216829, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15t0nzt/aitah_for_refusing_elective_surgery/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He'll have to stay on the list.", "NTA people are very quick to hypothetically give organs but when it comes down to it very hard decision.\n\nFor the people who are criticising you have they got themselves tested to see? Especially his brother who more likely to be a match.", "NTA\n\n\nTim doesn't deserve your kindness. However, if you want to look less like a bad guy say you'll do it. You will be examined by a doctor who says whether you're healthy or not to donate. Tell the doctor your struggles and that you don't feel healthy enough to do this but feel pressured. They can write up a document saying that while you're a match, you're not a suitable donor for your own health. My bro had to do this as he has Crohn's and couldn't donate his liver to our grandfather. Our Grandfather understood but some great aunts pestered my bro until the doc said \"while he is a match, he is not healthy enough to donate\"\n\nEven just not being in a good mental state can deem you unable to donate.

That's why they have people meet with a psych doctor to be sure this is what they really wanna do.", "NTA - *I've been contacted by several of our old mutual friends telling me that if they had the option to donate to save his life, they would*\n\nThen tell them to start the process to see if they are a match.  When they back pedal and say \"but you're already done that\" you can tell them that taking the test to see is you are a match is child's play to actually donating an organ.  That if they aren't even willing to see if they are a match then when they say that they would, you can call BS because they wouldn't even take the test.\n\nAt the end of the day:  Your body, your choice.", "NTA at all. Hang onto your innards and hope that you can stay healthy for your child's sake as well as your own.", "NTA - First and more importantly you have a family you need to protect.  While donating to save another life is notable, you need to evaluate the risk carefully.  You have and decided you can't.  Also, why would you for a complete AH, him?", "NTA\n\nThis is not dropping loose change in a UNICEF box, this is super serious and usually reserved to asks to family or close friends.  He made his bed and now must deal with the consequences.  Do you really think that there would be any appreciation anyway?  You have no obligation and all of these people who say they would do it say so only because they aren't (Did any actually get tested even?)", "NTA. Any of your reasons that you listed for not wanting to do the transplant would be a valid solo reason. Also, Tim seems like an asshole who doesn't deserve a free organ from anyone, but I'm not an ethics professor.", "NTA. None of those people were subjected to the real Tim like you were. As a human, sure it sucks that his health has taken a turn but he\u2019s done nothing to earn yet another piece of you. You have other priorities and you own health concerns to deal with. He is not your problem anymore.", "NTA, 1000 times NTA \n\nI have sympathy for anyone needing a transplant, but from what you have described, i remove that sympathy for Tim \n\norgan needed or not, this man, abused you, gaslit you, made you question your own sanity, and now he wants your organ like he called \"Dibs\" as if he can take power over you once more , and then when that failed her sent his little bitches on you to change your mind. gaslighting and manipulation by proxy, now he had his minions to do it. \n\nNTA, block him, and tell all his minions, you are saving the messages and will have them charged with harassment if they keep after you \n\nstay safe op, and live your best life with your growing family, Tim deserves nothing", "NTA\n\nI see the asshole is still gaslighting you, just through his brother. \n\nYour body, your choice.", "NTA\n\nI'd laugh at the very idea. Let the bastard die.", "NTA - You live your life and be happy.", "NTA\n\nI hear there's some means where people donate an organ, and a close relative donates to someone else with a matching type. So they *can* donate to save his life.", "NTA \n\nYou don't even need a reason but 'abuser' should be enough for anyone.\n\nOn your side if its a kidney? And you might want to have a kid, there are risks there.\n\nAlso there are chain donations, and heck even the rather horrific tourist transplants. So it's not like you are the only option. (If it's kidney, dialysis)\n\nSo, to sum up.\n\nNope", "NTA He did not even ask you himself but sent his brother.\nPeople like him need to face the consequences for treating other people in such an abusive way.\nStay strong, block his brother and/or friends if they continue to contact you.", "Are Tim's friends and family going to step up and help YOU when you are dealing with the after effects of this surgery?  Are they going to help you with your daughter while you recover?\n\nNTA.  You have to take care of yourself, first.  Just because you were a match doesn't make  you a good candidate to be a donor.  Tim is going to have to look elsewhere.", "NTA because living organ donation is always a voluntary choice/gift and you are never obligated to donate. You honestly wouldn\u2019t be allowed to anyway given your own health issues. There\u2019s a long ethical review before allowing someone to donate an organ, and they will not take organs from living donors with any health condition that will be exacerbated by the surgery or loss of the organ.", "NTA. Definitely NTA. You are not morally obliged to give your organs to a jerk that treated you poorly.", "NTA - There are risks to this major procedure. You have a right to say no to this! I understand completely the urgency in this situation. Not to mention, you haven\u2019t talked to him in over a year!", "NTA. True narcissists only show their real colors to their partners and a few select others. To the outside world, they are on their best behavior around friends, will be charming, do favors for others, etc. So now they are ganging up on you on his behalf. I'm glad you got away and cut contact! Block these people.", "NTA.\n\nYour priority is to your child. Tim didn't give a shit about you in the relationship and I doubt he gives a shit about you now, so there's no need to even entertain it. \n\nChange your number while you're at it.", "NTA\n\nBut in order to get these people to leave you alone, tell them that you talked to your doctor and they told you that you were a high risk candidate and no longer an eligible donor. Tell them your autonomic nervous system disorder has gotten worse. Hell, tell them you were recently exposed to rabies and can't donate to anyone until the doctor's are sure you're better. Tell them you're covid positive and can't donate. Tell them you recently had DVT/blood clots and it's too risky. Tell them any number of things that will get them to leave you alone.\n\nThis is the situation that lying was meant for. You can even go to your doctor and have them agree with you that you are no longer an eligible donor, if it gets them to leave you alone.", "NTA\n\nIMO your decision doesn't need to have anything to do with the past but everything with the future. You would be putting your own health at risk for someone you haven't seen in years. And at the same time you're risking the future you're building for your kid and foster kid. \n\nRegardless of all that, you've now been diagnosed with an autonomic nervous system disorder. That can be a big reason for a transplant surgeon to refuse or dismiss you as a living donor. It might be an idea to talk to a doctor about this, if it turns out I'm right in my reasoning you'd have a big proverbial stik to keep everyone at bay.", "NTA. I\u2019d lie and tell them I\u2019m disqualified due to the disorder to get them off my ass, then block.", "NTA First: The audacity of your abuser to ask you to go through major surgery to help them is astounding.  Second: you have your daughter and your health to think of.  If going through a surgery like that could risk your wellbeing or your ability to care for your child, that's more than enough reason not to.  Yes, it's a sad situation, but ultimately, your responsibility is to your child and yourself. Just block the ppl trying to guilt you, they're not worth your time.", "NTA. From what you say, the doctor will refuse you as a donor anyway as it will impact your life and your daughters life", "NTA!   These people are not your friends. Cut them out of your life", "NTA first off, protect your own health, and your kiddos.\n\nSecond, Tim has no one to blame but himself for alienating someone who could have later helped him.", "You are not obliged to become a donor. Especially for your former abuser. Even if you had perfect health, you still would not be obliged to donate your organs. This is simply too much to ask.  People, who are trying to guilt trip you into the surgery, are toxic just like him. Your decision is right, don't let them manipulate you.", "NTA - you have your own health issues, responsibility for two children and not much support. This could leave your seriously ill in the future. \n\nHave all the flying monkeys been tested? If not, then they should be and then they can live their words.", "NTA. We can debate the intricacies of ethics and Kohlberg's Dilemma, but it boils down to the fact that he psychologically abused you. You don't owe him anything, much less one of your organs.", "NTA - Awwww your friends are so sweet for offering to take your place. Assholes.", "NTA - I wouldn't donate to someone who made my life miserable. Anyone who thinks different is welcome to donate whatever Tim needs.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYour primary duty is to your children and part of that entails staying healthy enough to be their mother.   You are under no obligation to donate your body parts.   He was a controlling jerk to you.", "NTA - you have dependent children. Your health is the most important thing here.", "NTA\n\nOf course you shouldn't give an organ to a man who **abused** you. Christ.", "NTA.\n\nThat's all.", "NTA. Remember OP, you do NOT owe your abuser any of your organs. Actually, you don\u2019t owe ANYONE any of your organs.", "Nta. Absolutely not. \ud83d\udcaf no.", "NTA \u2026 even putting aside the fact that he treated you horribly you rightfully decided you shouldn\u2019t put yourself in danger while supporting two children. \n\nThe children come first and that is the right decision for you", "NTA \nUm, it's an entire organ that has to be cut out of your body. It's a lot more than an act of kindness.", "NTA. Not at all. Do not do it.", "NTA.  As a hopeful organ recipient myself, I am disgusted on your behalf.  You don't owe Tim a damned thing.  He abused you and now you're supposed to put your own life at substantial risk to save him?  Nopity nope nope nope.\n\nI had a potential living donor.  She turned out to be bi-polar and off her meds AND a thief who tried to insert herself in our family.  I am sure she would have made the situation transactional no matter what paperwork she signed...\"My car needs a lot of repairs I can't afford and I gave you a kidney...\" Nope.  I'll take my chances on the list.", "NTA\n\nTell them unfortunately you have a medical condo that precludes you from donating", "NTA - You wouldn't be morally obligated in any way shape or form to be a living donor for Tim even if he was the best guy on the face of the earth and you were still in a romantic relationship with him. Being a living donor is not without risk and you have a child whose needs must come first, end of story.", "What are you kids going to do while you recover?\n\nNTA you're not in a position to donate. You have responsibilities and a physical and a mental illness that could potentially crush you if you do. \n\nIf you feel you need to be formally excused, see if there's a way to be labeled as unsuitable for psychological reasons, like bringing an exemption of sort of your psychologist, or medical. Maybe if you take pills to manage your ptsd or disorder, that could be a reason.\n\nBut this, again, is optional. You have children ldren. You have responsibilities. You need to be there and be healthy.\n\nYou owe everything to your children, you brought one into the world and the other in your family.\n\nYou don't owe squat to your ex.", "NTA.\n\nAlso is there any way you could let people know what happened between you and Tim? To let them know what he did to you? Preferably with proofs. They might not be aware of it at all. That might help, you might even find support.", "NTA.\n\nIts kind of fucked up to pressure someone with kids who are still extremely young into donating an organ to somebody who was just a boyfriend.\n\nWhat if in the future your kid needs a transplant? What if something goes wrong and it risks your life?\n\nIgnoring the fact he's an awful person to begin with, these are all legitimate reasons that cant be used against you to shut down any arguments. If anybody keeps arguing past that, it quickly weeds out who actually cares for you as a person.", "NTA, you need to protect yourself. This person is awful and is probably controlling everything behind the scenes. My advice would be to \"exaggerate\" your autoimmune conditions. Tell them your doctor is strongly advising towards giving one of your fudging organs away. Idk just ramp it up and be so so so so so so sorry. Play into the victim scenario.

I lived with a manipulative fuck just like that who managed to charm the pants off friends and coworkers with his shy guy routine then came home and turned into an emotionally abusive asshole. You getting tested doesn't give him a carte Blanche to demand organs forever, far as I can tell his behavior negated that possibility. I no longer carry trauma from my abuse, in fact if I hadn't have been dragged down as far as I had by him I never would have examined the patterns in my history and behavior that were holding me back and that's a huge win for me. I still genuinely hope he's dead because if he isn't some poor girl is going through the same thing right now (he never thought he needed psych help because he was a psych major in college...). \n\nHe treated you like shit, as far as I'm concerned he revoked any right to even ask that kind of favor.", "NTA.
