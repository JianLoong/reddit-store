She would drive me bananas.  Seriously it\u2019s a wedding.", "How do you deal with the blatant narcissism and subtle (but not really discreet) hate?\n\nDon't let your mom near your wedding. Surround yourself with love and support.", "NTA. So she wants to wear a white dress that may look bridal to your wedding? Gross. Yes it is weird.", "NTA, and congratulations. She can wear blue or stay home. What the hell is wrong with her?", "NTA. Get all the other women to wear long white dresses. If they have a wedding dress of their own, to wear that if they want. All the blokes can wear blue shirts. \n\nYou and your groom can then \u201cstand out\u201d in something totally different.", "NTA", "I\u2019m so sorry, but if I were your fianc\u00e9, I\u2019d be rethinking what I was about to take on in the in-laws department..\ud83e\udee3\n\nNTA **of course**!", "It sounds like your mother is a narcissist, and she\u2019s in competition with you. I have a daughter and I would never dream of wearing white to my own daughters wedding. What the hell is she thinking. She got mad because you\u2019re getting married and the attention would not be on her, so she found a way to try and get the attention on her and then she threw a fit because you were upset about it and had something to say about it. Just because she\u2019s your mom doesn\u2019t mean that she needs to be there my husband and I got married in Vegas and we\u2019ve been happily married for 30 years or so. It seems lol I\u2019d rather have done that then be worried that my mother was going to wear a white dress to my wedding gross.", "Nta", "NTA, it\u2019s your wedding, it\u2019s not about her.

I\u2019d strongly recommend getting security at your wedding as she will likely turn up in a white dress anyway.", "I mean, does she want to marry you?? Holy hell.\nNTA!!!", "NTA\n\nYeah, your mom is weird.  Like really weird.\n\nEnlist a friend to stand by with a glass of red wine 'just in case'.   You may even want to pack one of her dresses that isn't white 'just in case'.", "Anyone who is not the bride, groom or been explicitly asked to wear a white outfit by the couple and still wears white to a wedding is an a\\*\\*hole. It is never ok to wear white to someone else's wedding (ok maybe a few edge cases but in general)", "NTA.  Nope, she can't wear that to the wedding.  Make sure she knows you are serious.  Have someone ready to escort her away from the wedding if she's in that dress.  She's definitely being weird.\nYou are not over reacting.  You are not wrong.", "NTA.\n\nAnd this wouldn't work out the way she thinks either. Everybody who saw her would be super uncomfortable. She'd get all sorts of negative attention both then and whenever she showed wedding pictures afterwards. Not that you can expect her to understand this - people who are inclined to wear white to another person's wedding are not the sort of people who really understand other people's point of view enough to realize what a big mistake it would be.", "NTA your mum needs to understand your a grown man now and theres boundaries", "NTA.  People are talking about red wine, but I would suggest liquid chocolate, because your mom is being super shitty.", "Yes. She sees herself as her son's bride.", "I got lucky and my sister found me one at Target for 35 dollars.  My sister and other friend both used Rent the Runway.  I bought my dress because I\u2019m getting married in April so there\u2019s a small chance I might wear it or donate it", "If I wasn\u2019t close with the person I wouldn\u2019t have gone. Plus the wedding was a destination wedding in Santa Barbara and I love SB.   The bride had everyone wear white because she doesn\u2019t like being the center of attention.  She was much harder to spot in a crowd of everyone wearing the same color", "Nothing makes a narcissist parent act crazy like a wedding.

Very red.", "I would not be surprised. I stayed at her house for a night a couple of years ago because that's where bff was staying and she treated my bff like a maid w/o pay.

It\u2019s giving some emotional incest vibes from your mom tbh.

Obviously some emotional incest on OP\u2019s mom\u2019s part here. But what are the motivations in general? Parents being unable to see their offspring as adults?

You just don't.", "NTA your wedding your rules. Your mom is wrong. She can give you the silent treatment that's okay assuming she will not be in attendance.

I don't know that you can overreact to that.  NTA", "NTA. This is just so mean and unnecessary. She was looking for a fight, found one and then turned it on you. What worries me is the dig at the fact that there is no bride. Does your mom actually support your relationship and marriage?", "Uninvite her to the wedding and get security so she can't barge into the wedding and try and ruin it", "I am somewhere in between \"dictating colour isn't cool\" and \"at least OP chose blue - if they don't specify shades, it's not a very hard color'. \n\nA white outfit on the other hand (if the couple would specify that)? I don't own a white pair of trousers or a white skirt, so I'd have to buy that, along with white shoes (and I have difficult feet). \n\nOn topic: NTA . Your mother sounds scary, and it feels like enmeshment/emotional incest is going on. I feel bad for your significant other; I have this inkling your mum is going to be a very difficult mother in law.", "Just wanted to add this, look up \"enmeshed mother\" or \"enmeshment\" and see if it applies to your mother. If you don't already, see a therapist regarding her just to get some perspective on her behaviors from a professional, or ideas on how to deal with her crossing boundaries. If you and future husband plan on having kids, it might be best to figure out how to handle her behaviors before children become part of the equation. Best of luck to you and your partner <3", "That\u2019s the very thought when I see someone who isn\u2019t the bridal couple wearing white against the dress code. \n\nWent to a wedding at a SF vineyard. One of the old uni friends who had flown over wore a knee length, over lace, pure white dress. The side eye people! And the poor bride was in tears - everyone, and I mean everyone sidelined her and it was the main conversation on my friends big day.\n\nFuck you Anita, you big old drama llama narc\n\nNTA - OP, get a 3rd party to ask your mum why she wants to marry her son and does she need the number of a good therapist to help her through this?", "honestly that tracks with some indian moms. they coddle their sons so she possibly views your bff (his WIFE!) as competition for his attention, as well as his new live-in maid.", "I\u2019ve had a few weddings in my extended circle that were costume parties, mostly on Halloween or the nearest weekend.
