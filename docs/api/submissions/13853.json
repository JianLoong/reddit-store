Your bodies, your home, your choices. Nothing indecent or dangerous here except Step-Father\u2019s mindset.", "Not the asshole. He doesn\u2019t get to decide how you interact with your family. If everyone is comfortable, it\u2019s okay and you do you.", "NTA. family cuddles are just that, family cuddles. anyone who implies otherwise is the one with a problem", "OP, You are NTA in this situation. \n\nYour stepdad was told that he was not allowed to parent you unless it was an emergency,  yet he continued to impose his discomfort with your family's physical affection on you & your sisters. \n\nIt's understandable that you would eventually become frustrated & snap at him after repeatedly asking him to drop the issue.\n\nIt's also worth noting that you didn't insult him or attack him personally - you simply told him to stop bringing it up.While it's possible that you could have expressed yourself in a more polite or diplomatic manner, it's also important to recognize that you were likely feeling defensive & annoyed at the moment.\n\nIt might be worth having a conversation with your stepdad (or your mom, if you feel more comfortable) about setting clearer boundaries around this issue to prevent future conflicts.", "Nta at all he overstepped and it\u2019s definitely a him problem if he finds it weird. I don\u2019t think it was needlessly rude or blunt, he\u2019s made these comments before and been told to stop but he didn\u2019t", "NTA. I think he may have trauma and is projecting it onto your family.", "NTA. Honestly, I think this sub often encourages too much disrespect, but I don\u2019t feel that you were disrespectful at all. He\u2019s making something normal, sweet and caring into something weird. That\u2019s 100% his problem.", "NTA. Needlessly rude and blunt? No. I'd argue that this is a case of quite the opposite.\n\nHe was told upfront by your parents that this was a matter that his opinion was not wanted. Despite that, he has persisted for 3 years in expressing his opinion. And has been told to knock it off repeatedly.\n\nAt some point with matters like this, you need to start getting \"rude and blunt\" because less firm communication isn't working. He is not listening and still thinks his opinion matters. Firm direct communication may be what is necessary for him to here the message.\n\nAnd I hate to say it, but your mom is part of the problem here. She is probably trying to \"stay out of the middle\" to avoid an argument. But, by not confronting him when he does this, she's giving him tacit approval.\n\nAt one level, this is understandable, because she is the one in a relationship with him. At the same time, by failing to back up what she was a part of communicating to him originally, she is potentially undermining the future of her relationship with you and your sisters.\n\nWhen all y'all move away from home, if stepdad's attitude continues, how inclined will y'all be to visit regularly? Individually, much less together?", "NTA he\u2019s the one being gross and sexualizing it. If he or your mom gives you trouble ask why he\u2019s so insistent on sexualizing his wife\u2019s children.", "You could have phrased it more respectfully but overall you're NTA", "\"she backed us up, she thinks I was needlessly rude and blunt to him.\"\n\nThis.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
