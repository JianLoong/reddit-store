The only grandfather that I met growing up was my dad\u2019s stepfather because the fathers for both of my parents died when they were kid, and my paternal grandmother was the only one who remarried.  People in my family really didn\u2019t divorce and remarry, so I didn\u2019t really learn of the concept of step-grandfather or grand-stepfather into my teens, and even then I did  really care for that term because he was the only grandfather I got to spend time with.  NTA", "I think the big question is what your Dad (and your Husband's Dad if that applies) thinks.  Is your Dad not as involved by choice, or because he doesn't live nearby?  I would be a little gutted hearing my Ex's new partner being called Grandma or it's equivalent by my Grandchild.  A Step-Grand would be entitled to some title as Grandma or Grandpa's life partner, but I personally think it should be something different if the actual Grandparents are still alive and not estranged.  Many Grandparents probably dream of having special relationships with their Grandchildren and a place in their hearts that is shared by only their counterpart on the child's other side of the family.  It's only a step removed from a parent having to hear their child call someone else Mom or Dad.  Is this actually about you not being that close with your Dad?  If it is, your Husband might not feel the same way about his.\n\nThis is probably a sensitive issue for many, with the number of remarriages occurring in the decades since no-fault divorce came into play, and something which each family to which it applies has to iron out on it's own.", "He's been her grandpa for 2 years, why does your husband want to cut that relationship?\n\nNTA\n\nStand your ground.", "NTA - I've got 3 pairs of grandparents myself and there's no first or second class grandparents in my book.", "NTA.
