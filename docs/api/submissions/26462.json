I would\u2019ve been super excited as well, but it just wasn\u2019t your place to share this with everyone. You should have given it to your grandmother and talked to her first (assuming she\u2019s his widow).", "YTA but not with ill intent. You just should have talked to grandma before acting on your idea. It\u2019s a journal, which typically isn\u2019t something a person intends to share, so in a sense, it was a violation of trust that, in the absence of grandpa, extends to grandma who now has to provide answers that she wasn\u2019t prepared to share. Sometimes we need to check our impulses and make sure we aren\u2019t doing harm in our attempt to do good.", ">I thought I was doing something really special that would be well received. \n\nYTA. If that (or this story) is even true, you would have mentioned finding it to someone before completing this entire project: \"Hey Grandma, I found one of Grandpa's journals.  It might be cool to scan and save it for the family, no?\"\n\nThe right thing to have done after you read Page 1 and knew what you had, was to hand it over to your Grandmother. Not eagerly devour the private details of someone's diary and then publicize it to family.", "YTA. Seriously, dude. That was her husband's journal. If they were both dead that would be one thing, but the fact you went and made copies of the journal *before the thought of ever even going to her* is insane. \n\nI mean, you didn't even consider that his wife would get first dibs on his journal. Apologize to your grandmother.", "It wasn't your place to share his journal, or even read it. You should have handed it over to your grandmother immediately instead of treating it like celebrity gossip.  YTA", "YTA. You scanned someone's personal diary and sent it around like it was just a takeout menu. Why did you think you had the right to do that?", "YTA - you are not the owner of that journal or information, as his wife, your grandmother is. You mean to tell me at no point did you stop to think how this might have affected her? You went through someone else\u2019s stuff, read their diary, scanned it, disseminated the information to multiple people, and then put their widow in the awkward position of having to explain things she clearly wasnt comfortable with and not once thought how she might feel about it? \n\nSome grandson. \n\nYou owe your grandmother an apology. Give her back her husband\u2019s things, and learn to mind your own business.", "YTA. Dude. It's a journal. They're always incredibly private. Startlingly naive actions to do this.", "YTA. You stirred the pot with \"unspoken family sagas\" and are suddenly \\*surprised pikachu face\\* when people are upset?", "YTA for not discussing with Grandma first. It was her husband and she should have the final day while she is still alive.", "YTA, you scanned and made copies of someone's diary to share with everyone, do you realize that you're coming off as a mean girl villain in a teen movie?", "YTA he had a living spouse! You had no right to take her private property - and yes, that journal is hers now that he is gone - and decide to publish it for everyone to read. For you to not even mention it to her or ask? Yes, you are a selfish asshole.", "YTA - this journal is your grandmother\u2019s story too and she\u2019s still alive. You should have gone to your grandmother first and asked her if it was okay to share.", "YTA. You should not have done that. It was your Grandmother\u2019s right to keep that journal private or tell family what was in it. What you did was an invasion of privacy and you owe her a massive apology for being so insensitive.", "Honestly, this should have been discussed with your grandmother well before sharing with anyone. YTA. She should have first veto power over anyone else seeing the journal. Especially since you indicated you are storing the boxes and were not gifted the contents.", "I want to read it, but sadly YTA albeit unintentionally. It wasn\u2019t yours to share. Your grandmother is owed an apology. The car is out of the bag, but remember that this was private and never meant to be shared.", "I'm honestly shocked anyone would do this. What on earth were you thinking? That's a private diary, you absolutely should've asked his surviving spouse before sharing it. That was her husband. Good lord, this was so insensitive. \nYTA", "YTA\n\nWhy would you do that without checking with your grandma.\n\nIf she said yes then you need to ask people if they want to read it not just surprise them.\n\nYou sure you're 28?", "Yes,YTA, though maybe not intentionally. It's one thing to share the thoughts of an ancestor from several generations ago, but this is your own grandfather and your grandmother is still living! These were private thoughts and observations that you made public without even running it by her first. I don't blame her for feeling betrayed and violated. You owe her an enormous apology.", "YTA. As his spouse, there will have been a lot of *her* business in there, and the journal is her property. Why didn\u2019t you give her the journal? Or even ask her for her permission? And all the time you spent scanning it, it never once crossed your mind how she might feel?", "Have to go with YTA. Your intentions were good, but you shared somehing that wasn\u2019t your\u2019s to share, not without the consent of people that may have been discussed in the journal that are still living, mainly your grandmother. There may have been reasons why the untold family were untold.", "YTA You shared something intensely personal and private without even asking your grandmother, or telling her you found it. How would you feel if you'd kept a private diary, and someone shared it with your entire family? IT was NOT your place to share.", "Yta. \nWhat gave you the right to publish his journal to the entire family without asking your grandmother. Definitely a breech of trust. This wasn't a journal from two centuries ago and you're old enough to know better.", "YTA\n\nConsidering he has a living spouse, she gets to make that decision.  It was her property.  You legitimately just lifted, scanned and distributed her husband's personal and private thoughts. \n\nRidiculous.", "YTA. \n\nFirst you went through someone else's belongings without asking first. Then you read without asking, then scanned without asking, and distributed without asking. \n\nWhat made you think you were entitled to do any of those things with boxes that AREN'T YOURS TO TOUCH?\n\nIn what universe are you not an asshole in this scenario? If your Grandparents wanted this stuff known, they would have long before you decided to air it out to everyone. \n\nI hope you learned a valuable lesson about mind your business and stay out of others.", "YTA and I think everyone is being too soft on you. \n\nYou exposed a man's private fucking diary after he died and couldn't explain or defend himself dude what the fuck. \n\nUnless you were exposing heinous behavior all you did was violate both your grandparents life. \nYou posted stories of your grandfather's ROMANCES that weren't your grandmother all over for everyone to read and she didn't even know you did that!!! \n\nDid your grandmother ever read these journals? Or did she have to find out all your grandfather's hot juicy gossip the same way everyone else in your family did?", "YTA. Jeez, you're clearly desperate for attention. You didn't even talk to your grandmother first. Journals are private but you violated their privacy so you could show it off to your family. Shame on you for being so selfish. He was her husband and it should have been her choice. Instead you stole that choice away from her because you wanted to look good. And now you've hurt your grandmother as a result.", "YTA yikes poor grandma. Why wouldn't you talk with her before basically stealing something from her attic and distributing it.", "YTA. Well-intentioned, but that was your grandmother's to share, not yours. And if she never wanted to share it, so be it.", "YTA.  It's dumbfounding to me that you didn't discuss this with your grandmother first.", "NAH.  You are young, so you probably don't understand why this would have caused problems.  You should have talked about this with your Grandmother before sharing it with everyone.  Just chalk it up to a lesson learned.", "NTA because you meant well but, \n\nyou probably should have run it by your grandmother because she was still living and would likely have opinions over what she wanted shared since the journal is basically a diary and could contain very private information.", "NTA, but perhaps a bit naive. IMHO, dead people don't get the privilege of keeping secrets. But, Grandma also has the right to be upset. I think it was fine to do, but you also have to live with the consequences of hurt feelings of the living.", "To me, NTA but only because you had good intentions. More life experience would have told you the story told too much about living relatives for you to release the story unabridged.", "NTA.  What happened, happened people getting upset by the something so rare and special are ridiculous.", "NTA. There's all this gatekeeping of information in the older generations, followed with an almost immediate distain at why you don't understand what they understand.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A diary is pretty personal and he was her husband. There are things they may not have wanted anyone to know.", "I am the family historian and amateur genealogists, so understand the impulse to share amazing family stories. I re-read this a couple times trying to find where you ever had your grandmother's permission to open her boxes in the first place, let alone nose around inside her private belongings, read the contents of what is obviously a private journal, remove it, scan it, and pass it around like a supermarket flyer. Your grandmother simply asked you to help her move and to store some boxes. That did not give you the right to open her life to scrutiny. You massively violated her privacy, not just with regard to the journal but she has to assume with also everything else that was in those boxes. YTA. This was not just some careless oopsie, it was a series of successive boundary violations. You need to reflect upon and sincerely apologize for your actions. You will also need to accept that your relationship with her may be permanently undermined. She will never really know what other aspects of her privacy you violated while snooping through the boxes, or what else you know about her that she would never have freely choosen to share with her grandchild. You have also potentially harmed her relationships with other family members thanks to revelations from the journal.\n\nHad you handled things differently, this might have become a fascinating family history artifact *someday*. But instead you steamrolled right over grandma, grandpa, and frankly every family member he might have ever written an unvarnished thought about. Would you want your whole family to hear recordings of decades of your therapy sesssions? Of course not. Because it's where we go to freely process our most private thoughts without judgement and without worrying about who might be hurt or offended by our words.  A journal is no different. A journal is meant to be private, and should be respected as such unless and until either the author or their heir chooses to share it. Even if you had seen the journal in plain sight instead of digging it out of grandma's boxes (omg I still can't believe you did that), the moment you realized what it was you should have slammed it closed and handed it to grandma. It was never yours to read, let alone share.", "Gentle YTA. Your grandma is right. It was a part of her/their past to keep and tell if she wanted to. When you found it, you should have talked to her about it and what she wanted to do with it instead of sending it out to everyone. Personally, I love finding out stories of how cool my grandparents were in their youth (like my Pawpaw being a pretty successful pool shark or hitchhiking his way across 3 states to meet my grandma in person for the first time). But these are things they chose to share with me or others. You took the choice away from your grandma and it sounds like there may have been more than one sensitive topic she didn't want people knowing.", "NTA. Only person whose feelings you need to worry about are your Grandfather and since he isn't here to complain, fuck em.", "Yta. Do meant wel. But journals are secrets. I wouldn't want my family to read mine. I know someone who has lost her daughter. She threw her diary out because secrets must be secret.", "YTA\n\nThis was your grandma\u2019s property. You were kind to store it for her, but that didn\u2019t give you permission to snoop. \n\nAfter you invaded her privacy by snooping, you made a bigger asshole of yourself by sharing it with everyone. \n\nYou should have gone to your grandma first to ask permission.", "YTA.  That was your grandmother\u2019s possession that you handed out without permission.  You owe her a huge apology.", "YTA  I think you owe your grandmother an apology for invading her privacy.  You know that was her shared history too.  You shouldn't have read the journal in the first place.", "YTA!!!!\n\nOmg wth were you thinking?  If Grandma had passed and you talked to your parents first, maybe be ok to share.  But Grandma was still alive?\n\nTalk about a violation", "Well-intentioned, but YTA. You should have consulted your grandmother before even reading it, much less spreading it around.", "Why do dead people loose all rights to privacy? Like obviously they\u2019re not around to get mad but I feel like reading a living persons journal is a huge breach of privacy, just because they\u2019re dead doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t deserve basic respect. I can even understand wanting to read a journal after someone has passed, to feel connected but it still feels a little invasive to me.", "I love reading old journals and diaries.  My family found a  journal of my Great-great grandfather who served in the civil war.  It is simply amazing.  He wrote from the time just before he got married till his death in 1906.

As you wrote, if he just just meantioned it to someone first he could have been warned.\n\nIt seems like he just started sending out scanned pages. His relatives wasn\u2019t emotionally prepared and didn\u2019t get to decide fot themselves if they wanted to learn knew things about a departed relative.

Which makes me feel like you are simply shortsighted and made a mistake. But another part is that you didn\u2019t consider other people could have different perspectives and feelings than you. Which is lacking in empathy.\n\nYou seem to want to learn from this situation, and something to therefor examine more closely is how you  so completly misjudged the reactions of several people close to you. You made an assumption that everyone would feel like you. Why did you assume your feelings were universal? Why did your grandmas consent seem lika given to you? Understanding that better might be helpful in repairing the relationships thats been damaged by this.", "Mmm a quick browse of his reddit suggests he probably shouldn't share it with gf", "I didn't even see that."]}
