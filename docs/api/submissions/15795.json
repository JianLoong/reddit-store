That if I add my family's name, our son won't be a true Jr. \n\nThough I understand this is obviously a cultural difference, I don't see why a compromise can't be made here, since \"Star\" will likely get lost in official paperwork, and our son will more commonly be referred to as Spongebob Squarpants, Jr. \n\nI also feel like our son gets my husband's entire name, and I would like for my family's legacy to be included. \n\nTo add to this, both of our daughter's names follow the \"(first name) Star Squarepants\" pattern, and my son would be the only sibling without it. \n\nI understand a father and son having a special connection, but I feel like I shouldn't be dismissed just cause I'm not the same sex of my child. \n\nAITA\n\n\nedit: When I say \"finally having a boy\" it's because we had two girls.

Do the daughters feel lesser because Daddy seemingly had SO much more investment in the son's name than in theirs?\n\nAt the end of the day, your son is already getting ALL of his father's name. I think it's petty and disrespectful of your husband to want to exclude even the smallest piece of yours.", "NTA.

Your compromise is extremily valid and than ALL the kids names would be matching which should be important to all parents.\n\nAlso, this junior-stuff, who wants it? It's just complicated, papers get sent to the wrong person, it's just unnecessairy complicated. It might be a cultural thing but I truelly don't get it.

We're the proud parents of two daughters!", "NTA. I was leaning towards N-A-H before you said that both of your other children have their names as \u201cStar SquarePants\u201d. This seems like a weird ego flex by your partner. It\u2019s not typical to include Jr on the birth certificate (not where I live anyway), it\u2019s an informal way of referring to the son instead of the father. If your son ended up naming his son the same name, then your son would be Sr and his son Jr - it updates with each generation, which is why it\u2019s not typically included in the legal name. \n\nAlso, fathers and sons don\u2019t automatically have a \u201cspecial bond\u201d; these are achieved by having a good supportive relationship with your child, and do not come about just because you share a gender.", "NTA for wanting your name and culture to be part of your sons name.\n\nBit concerned about your husband being furious about it, though, seems a bit of an overreaction to me.", "NTA, those absolutely same names are headache in future.

I hated that my parents were projecting their desire for us to be their clones through their naming of us. I changed my name as an adult, and it took YEARS for my family to startstart respecting that change.

Conclusion: he should have both of your names like the other children.", "NTA it's weird as hell to use a different naming convention for some of your children!  Also the whole junior thing is narcissism personified.  Let your child be their own person, not just a clone onto which you thrust some imagined family legacy!

He should be grateful you're allowing him to give your son his first name.", "It is SO difficult later on when you have people with the same name.

I used to be in the title industry and it came up A LOT. \n\nDon\u2019t give your kid the same name plus Jr. It gives a kid an unfair legacy to have to live up to and it also means the kid doesn\u2019t even get a name of their very own.

We landed on the name specifically because every person not only religiously has used their number on documents (lessening the chance of a mix/switch up), and because they all went by a diminutive, nickname, or a name based on their number order.
