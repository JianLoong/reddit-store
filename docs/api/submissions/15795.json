That if I add my family's name, our son won't be a true Jr. \n\nThough I understand this is obviously a cultural difference, I don't see why a compromise can't be made here, since \"Star\" will likely get lost in official paperwork, and our son will more commonly be referred to as Spongebob Squarpants, Jr. \n\nI also feel like our son gets my husband's entire name, and I would like for my family's legacy to be included. \n\nTo add to this, both of our daughter's names follow the \"(first name) Star Squarepants\" pattern, and my son would be the only sibling without it. \n\nI understand a father and son having a special connection, but I feel like I shouldn't be dismissed just cause I'm not the same sex of my child. \n\nAITA\n\n\nedit: When I say \"finally having a boy\" it's because we had two girls.

There is no previous instance of this, he would be the first.\n\nedit 3: Just because it's been asked a few times. My daughters' names were actually his ideas that I ended up loving. There was no compromise from either side. It was an easy, open conversation that stretched over the months of pregnancy, which is sort of why this rigidness for his Jr has caught me by surprise.\n\nedit 4: I didn't expect this much traction, thank you for all these different perspectives. I had no idea so many Jrs were so unhappy. Everyone's culture is different, though as we see.

Please. \n\nI think you are also right on the money to consider the effects of the children having different names. Does the son feel alienated from mom because he's the only one without her name? Do the daughters feel lesser because Daddy seemingly had SO much more investment in the son's name than in theirs?\n\nAt the end of the day, your son is already getting ALL of his father's name. I think it's petty and disrespectful of your husband to want to exclude even the smallest piece of yours.", "NTA.

Your compromise is extremily valid and than ALL the kids names would be matching which should be important to all parents.\n\nAlso, this junior-stuff, who wants it? It's just complicated, papers get sent to the wrong person, it's just unnecessairy complicated. It might be a cultural thing but I truelly don't get it.

It\u2019s not typical to include Jr on the birth certificate (not where I live anyway), it\u2019s an informal way of referring to the son instead of the father. If your son ended up naming his son the same name, then your son would be Sr and his son Jr - it updates with each generation, which is why it\u2019s not typically included in the legal name. \n\nAlso, fathers and sons don\u2019t automatically have a \u201cspecial bond\u201d; these are achieved by having a good supportive relationship with your child, and do not come about just because you share a gender.", "NTA for wanting your name and culture to be part of your sons name.\n\nBit concerned about your husband being furious about it, though, seems a bit of an overreaction to me.", "NTA, those absolutely same names are headache in future.

I hated that my parents were projecting their desire for us to be their clones through their naming of us.

Conclusion: he should have both of your names like the other children.", "NTA it's weird as hell to use a different naming convention for some of your children!  Also the whole junior thing is narcissism personified.  Let your child be their own person, not just a clone onto which you thrust some imagined family legacy!

We landed on the name specifically because every person not only religiously has used their number on documents (lessening the chance of a mix/switch up), and because they all went by a diminutive, nickname, or a name based on their number order.

Why does she?", "I honestly am so concerned that there are systems that are mixing so many people up.\n\nLike are not checking your date of birth?? Whenever I have any healthcare appointment they check my name, address and date of birth against the paperwork before anything else. \n\nThis comes in handy when 1) you have family traditions re. names OR 2) you live somewhere where I swear EVERYONE knows at least 1 instance they know of where they knew 2 unrelated people with the same name\n\nIn my class at school there was Christina Lauren James, and in the class above us there was a Christina Lauren James. Both parents chose one of the most girls names in the countries minority language, and the most common middle name for girls born in that like 3-4 span of time, they also had the most common surname in my country. Girls went to the same primary and high school. Maybe different doctors but same catchment areas for the hospitals etc. Schools never mixed up their paperwork etc. yet apparently some systems out there are issuing marriage certificates to the wrong people. How???\n\nPeople on reddit the other day were saying sharing first initials with family was bad enough and causing mix ups at school/work and I'm like??? I share first initials with my brother and my father and its never been a problem, even when we all lived at the same address \n\nMaybe everyone I know has just been lucky", "That\u2019s not how it works in our tradition, or any other people that I know that do this. (Not to say it doesn\u2019t happen ever). My father and grandfather both had older sisters that didn\u2019t get the name. \n\nAlso, gender incongruent names might work with some names, Kyle or Francis or something. It be pretty weird to say, \u201clet me introduce you to my daughter Hank Jr\u201d", ">Medical mixups are also a common thing especially in smaller towns or where they go to the same doctor.\n\nThis is so true as it have happened to my Mom (we live in a major city).  My Mom's (fictional) name is Janett Brown and there was another patient at my Mom's doctor's office who was named Janet T Brown.  Her doctor and the office staff didn't pay attention that my Mom have an extra t in her name because the other patient's middle name started with a T.  Mom's doctor told her she had stage 4 kidney disease, until Mom had to ask her if she had the right patient and mentioned her birthday, yep, wrong patient.  Her doctor would often call in prescriptions that my Mom had no knowledge of and would have me go pick it up.  I would ask her what the medication was for and she would say she didn't know, the doctor just called it in.  I would refused to let her take any unknown medication without talking to her doctor about it first.  Turns out it was for the other Janet T Brown and Mom couldn't return the medication because it went against the pharmacy's policy.  I kept begging Mom to leave her doctor because that doctor is going to end up causing her great harm.  But Mom is soooooo dedicated to her doctors/people/places that she dragged her feet until I made an appointment for her at a new primary physician.  He was EXTREMELY thorough and talks to her and **not at** her, that she commented that she wished she'd listened to me in the first place.  But since she's been his patient, there are no more mistakes.", ">\u201clet me introduce you to my daughter Hank Jr\u201d\n\nlol yeah, but isn't the idea of treating your female children differently than your male children (or vice versa) just because of their genitals a bit archaic? I mean I think it's probably for the best we do away with all of this name non-sense (though I certainly considered gender congruent names for my own children so am throwing stones from a half-glass house).", "I think giving a kid a gender appropriate name is a pretty far cry from treating them differently. I like to think I\u2019m not raising my daughter any differently than I\u2019d raise a son, but since I don\u2019t have a son, I can\u2019t say 100% that I am. \n\nBut there are certain things I suppose I might feel differently about. One example is I always thought it\u2019d be cool to eventually ride motorcycles with my \u201cson\u201d, as I did with my dad. I\n\nI won\u2019t stop her if she has an interest when she\u2019s old enough, but don\u2019t really want my daughter anywhere near them because of how dangerous they are. Sometimes I wonder if I\u2019d have the same feeling if I had a son, or if that aversion would be there based on the simple fact that it\u2019s my child, regardless of gender. \n\nI\u2019ll likely never truly know the answer.", "Why is there always a comment on this sub like \u201cthis is a red flag, you should split, he/she sounds horrible\u201d ect.
