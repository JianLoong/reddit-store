I set up decor and a bowl of candy outside my front door since we were gonna be out with our toddler. While my kid was having dinner I heard some commotion outside our front door and went to check it out through the peep hole. I saw a couple teens run off with all the candy and some of the decoration pieces I put out. I followed them down the stairs and confronted them about basically stealing my things. They tried lying to me about it but I told them I saw everything. Eventually they gave me my decor back. I cussed them out because I was just so upset. I didn\u2019t care about the candy or the decor that much even it\u2019s just the fact that they did it. Am I the asshole in this situation? It\u2019s just been eating away at me for the way that I reacted. I feel so stupid but I think I had the right to be upset.", "created_utc": 1667272522, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yix9b8/aita_teens_stealing_on_halloween/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kids can be really really stupid, they needed to be reminded that their shitty actions like that directly affect other people. It's not just their world and they can forget that", "NTA because you were just trying to be nice and considerate which you didn\u2019t have to do", "NTA. You put the decorations and you set the bowl for everyone to partake in the holiday, not for a couple of miscreants to take it away because they thought it would be funny. Stealing is stealing, no matter how you put it, and it damages the trust between neighbours and the general good vibes and ambience in a neighbourhood. It could lead to next year nobody wanting to put up decorations, since there will always be the chance of having stupid teenagers stealing the things that were set up for all the neighbours to enjoy. It is easy for a handful of idiots to ruin everything for the kids and the adults who happen to delight in these things.", "NTA. \"Kids\" like these spoil the holiday fun and spirit for everyone.  That is never okay!  I would have been upset, too.  You set things up so that kids coming to your home, while you are out, get a treat and enjoy the decorations.  To have badly behaved teens come and try to wreck for others stinks!\n\nI have never minded teens that come around, along with the little ones, as I just love seeing people have fun.  We've been lucky that even the older kids have been well mannered, every year.  I certainly expected my own kids to be respectful and mind their manners.  Sadly, not all kids are as well supervised.\n\nHope you managed to have fun with your own child, even with the stress you experienced!", "You probably shouldn\u2019t have cussed them out but NTA for letting them know what they did was wrong and not allowing them to lie or get away with it.", "NTA", "NTA! Good for you! These teens are a different breed. Probably never been spoken to harshly by an adult \ud83d\ude05", "NTA. Refrain from cussing at them next time though ;)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
