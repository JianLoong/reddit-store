We have been divorced for 3 years and the co-parenting relationship has been very difficult. We ended on bad terms and we still do not see eye to eye on parenting styles. I try to be the best dad I can, but this situation was the final straw. \n\nThe reason me and Chloe divorced was primarily finances. We both worked full time whenever we started dating. Whenever our daughter was born Chloe stopped. Then back to work till our divorce when our daughter was 11. During that time I was pretty much an ATM. My ex wife paid for literally nothing. I paid for everything including dinners, groceries, entertainment. My ex wife paid half the mortgage and that was her only financial contribution. I would bring up constantly about how I felt used. Her response was that I was the man of the family. She claimed to want a traditional marriage where the man provides. I said then I expect a traditional wife. Clean the house regularly, have a meal on the table when I get home, etc. She said she worked full time so shouldn\u2019t be expected to do all that. I said then you aren\u2019t a traditional wife but expect a financially good situation for yourself. This along with some of her \u201cfriends\u201d that I disliked, was enough for me to file for divorce. \n\nThe trip is for my daughters dance team I didn\u2019t want her to join in the first place as she wasn\u2019t even interested in dance. Just the social aspect of being on this team. I told my ex I\u2019m not paying for it so she did. The trip is to go to Florida to compete in competitions. It\u2019s like $1K and she\u2019s gotta have a chaperone. Total cost with a parent will be 1,500. Chloe asked if I would pay for half of the trip. I said absolutely not. She should have plenty saved up from the divorce and her private accounts she never touched. \n\nSince it\u2019s her weekend, I don\u2019t feel like bankrolling her vacation either. She said it\u2019s not a vacation and I said absolutely it is. If I pay half then it\u2019s making her trip cheaper. I said she should have money saved up and if not that\u2019s her problem. My daughter is pissed because my ex wife told her they couldn\u2019t go. My daughter asked why and I told her the exact reasons. That her mom is cheap and unwilling to open her accounts and I\u2019m sick of being an ATM. My daughter then asked if it was because I was going on a trip with my GF. I said I was going on a trip that weekend with my GF but that had nothing to do with it. Our trip had been planned for months and it was my money. My daughter asked if she could come on my trip and I said no. It\u2019s her moms week and she has told me countless times she doesn\u2019t like my GF. Even though my GF has been nothing but nice.

I think she could afford to pay for this trip.", "Yeah but he didn't say it that way.  He had to take a stab at his ex.  \n\nMy friend's dad is like this.  It's been years but he still will use any opportunity to make a snide comment to everyone about his ex wife/her mother.  Including to her.   \n\nKids aren't therapist and they shouldn't be used as a vent board for their parents relationship problems.", "Okay let's put it in simple words:\n\nYou're a kid. You go to Dad's house and he says all these horrible things about mom. \n\nAs a kid, what do you think that's gonna do to them? It's gonna make you think mom is the bad person here. \n\nYou go to mom's house, and now she is saying bad things about dad. Well now I think both my parents are bad people. \n\nAs a child, who do I trust? Who do I feel safe with? These are things a child should never have to question.\n\nAdults bringing children into adult conversations and arguments is never okay.", "K well luckily for you I have experience handling child custody issues and you\u2019re wrong \ud83e\ude77", "So you know mom has likely spent a metric ton of money on this, then. While dad holds his purse strings to punish the both of them for what happened during the marriage. Now he gets to freely badmouth the mother in your opinion? Wild.", "could be, I get a feeling that she heard it from her mom", "Isn't the purpose for competitions? As per the post?", "but you said it was for a team activity. People on athletic teams go to tournaments and the like all the time. Stop thinking about getting one over on your former wife and think about your teenage child", "You are a sad sad little man. Your are referring to a sport that greatly benefits your daughter as essentially nothing. I feel for your daughter. Also ypu do realize your being an abuser yourself to your daughter. Grow the fuck up. Damn. You are sad and pathetic.", "You are so tight-fisted it\u2019s unreal. You punish your daughter to spite her mother.", "It is if it's because your butter and pissed at her mother. YTA and honestly a shit dad from the sounds of it. Your daughter has a great opportunity and YOU are holding her back bc you hate her mother. If you were a good dad, her mother wouldn't even be a factor.", "You're the abuser, not your ex. You're on here laughing about how much you're hurting your daughter. You're happy to hurt her because you want to get back at your ex. You've dragged your daughter into the fight with your ex and your daughter is the one who is hurting her as a result. And you're laughing about it like the selfish asshole that you are.", "did you offer to go as a chaperone yourself? and have your abuser pay for your discounted trip?\n\nI'm not sure how a teenage dance competition becomes a boujee resort vacation. If you are honestly opposed to the idea of that trip on its own merit - that's a separate story, but you admitted yourself that you are mostly opposed to it because you are butthurt by your ex\n\nalso, help me to understand the financial abuse. So you both work, she pays half of the mortgage, you pay the bills whatever. Who shops for groceries? Were you the only one buying food and unless you paid your wife would let you all starve? What about shopping? If you told your wife that you won't pay for her clothes or hair appointment, she would what? Steal your credit card? What if you go on a trip and you say that you will pay for your daughter but your wife needs to zelle you cash for her own ticket.\n\nI don't see how a grown man can be \"abused\" unless he is actively giving the money. Unless you were agreeing to it at the time and then decided that you didn't get \"your money's worth\" out of that marriage after the fact. Sure it would be a shitstorm every time you refused, but if you thought she is being unreasonable and talking didn't help, what did you do then?\n\nSame for the housework - if she's not being a traditional housewife. OK, don't do the laundry. What happens then? Your wife will just wait you out?", "Ahhh I can see where this post is going...\nRIP OP", "so sad you won't help your daughter with this trip and you're already prioritizing your girlfriend over your daughter", "I'm not so sure; he paid for half the mortgage, dinners, groceries and entertainment but no comment on medical, child care, school activities. Which leads me to believe ex paid those things related to their daughter.\n\nMy parents split their bills proportional to income dad had house, mom had kids, groceries and home improvements.", "My point..... You're making it.\n\n\nThey are *both* the Genesis of this problem.", "Do you think being a parent is a part-time job?\n\n\nWhen you wonder why your daughter is low contact with you later in life, remember how you dismissed her and her interests and weaponized her against her mother.", "Since you refuse to act like a parent, yes", "I get that the divorce left you angry and honestly I understand why you filed, but you\u2019re being wayyyy to petty and transactional towards your daughter when it was her mother that took advantage of you. You\u2019ll forget that $500 one way or the other, but your daughter will never forget that you had the option to send her on a trip like this and chose not to bc of her mother. I\u2019d feel differently if you couldn\u2019t afford it but it\u2019s clear you can. You should want the best for your kid, even if that means compromise with a less than deserving ex.", "A dear friend of mine has an ex kind of like yours. The ex was in charge of their daughter's bday party this year. It's her 13th, so mom went all out planning it, but then didn't budget properly for a cake. Daughter had her heart set on a particular cake that she had been asking mom about & mom promised. Oops. \n\nWhat did my friend do? *He paid for the cake*. Didn't take credit. Only grumbled to close friends. Why? Because he's dad 24/7, not just when it's his \"turn\". And because he loves his daughter.\n\nETA: YTA. Your ex being shitty is not an excuse for you to be shitty. If nothing else, the \"why should I make my gf put up with my kid\" sealed the deal on that one.", "I like how you find the 1 comment agreeing with you ignore all the rest.\n\nYou are a shit father who is letting his hatred for his ex wife ruin his relationship with his daughter.\n\nYOU might not think it's important but it's important to your daughter. And if you weren't such a self-absorbed ass, you might see that.", "I feel like you are probably right...but..to seem reasonable I would offer to pay half of your kids cost ($500). Anything for her chaperoning etc is on her. She will either accept it or not.", "Well, you could tell your daughter that you\u2019re happy to pay for her to go, your half, which is $500. There is no reason that her mother needs to go, as you already know.  If the mother refuses to pay the other half or allow her daughter to go without her, then it\u2019s on her and not you.   \n\n\nIt think it\u2019s a waste of money too. However, I also buy my kids Robux.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already spent a small fortune on LPS, JoJo bows and countless other useless other things. It\u2019s just part of the game. I\u2019m just hoping I can cash in some Robux for a wedding venue in the future.", "Okay.  The math we\u2019re totally ignoring is the amount the mother was demanding for herself. For the sake of sanity, we have decided she longer matters and only use the $1000/$500 amounts.   \n\n\nMy basic math skills are enhanced with an advanced level of divorce dynamics and emotional overload equations both basic and advanced levels.", "Whilst I agree with your hypothetical, there isn\u2019t remotely enough evidence from OP to apply that to this situation; you\u2019re just making guess work of one situation and applying.", "So much provable experience congrats. \ud83d\ude02", "I think it's also important to know whether OP is already paying child support which could be used for towards the trip fees. Everyone on this thread acting like a kid is entitled to a $1500 school trip is fucking wild to me to begin with though. I would have never even asked my parents to pay for anything that expensive as a kid. Let alone be snotty and entitled about it.", "You are completely ignoring the part that the child needs a chaperone, are you? It\u2019s not a vacation for her. If he paid the 500$ for the KID, so HALF, the mom could afford her portion and the kids other half.", "If he pays half the trip he\u2019s paying 500 - doesn\u2019t matter if ex\u2019s portion for the trip is 500 - the money he puts forth is going to his daughter. It\u2019s not hard.", "Lol how is there no evidence? OP said he called his wife cheap to his daughter. \n\nI'm done talking to you since you obviously are too obtuse to see the obvious here.", "I handle it in my professional life \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry if that trumps having no experience but an opinion.", "No kidding! If he can afford it, great, if not, nope.   \n\n\nI paid for my own $1500 trip to Europe by working a year in advance for it. A week\u2019s notice is not sufficient for a $500 trip.", "Well, you are ignoring the fact the mother did not discuss with the father in advance. He and his girlfriend could have been chaperones, right?   \n\n\nMaybe, the dad can chaperone and the mom can pay half of his way?   \n\n\nShe pays for herself or she stays home. There are plenty of chaperones without a need for 1:1 ratio.", "\u2764\ufe0f", "Don\u2019t say things on the internet if you can\u2019t prove maybe?"]}
