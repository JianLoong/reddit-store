We have been divorced for 3 years and the co-parenting relationship has been very difficult. We ended on bad terms and we still do not see eye to eye on parenting styles. I try to be the best dad I can, but this situation was the final straw. \n\nThe reason me and Chloe divorced was primarily finances. We both worked full time whenever we started dating. Whenever our daughter was born Chloe stopped. Then back to work till our divorce when our daughter was 11. During that time I was pretty much an ATM. My ex wife paid for literally nothing. I paid for everything including dinners, groceries, entertainment. My ex wife paid half the mortgage and that was her only financial contribution. I would bring up constantly about how I felt used. Her response was that I was the man of the family. She claimed to want a traditional marriage where the man provides. I said then I expect a traditional wife. Clean the house regularly, have a meal on the table when I get home, etc. She said she worked full time so shouldn\u2019t be expected to do all that. I said then you aren\u2019t a traditional wife but expect a financially good situation for yourself. This along with some of her \u201cfriends\u201d that I disliked, was enough for me to file for divorce. \n\nThe trip is for my daughters dance team I didn\u2019t want her to join in the first place as she wasn\u2019t even interested in dance. Just the social aspect of being on this team. I told my ex I\u2019m not paying for it so she did. The trip is to go to Florida to compete in competitions. It\u2019s like $1K and she\u2019s gotta have a chaperone. Total cost with a parent will be 1,500. Chloe asked if I would pay for half of the trip. I said absolutely not. She should have plenty saved up from the divorce and her private accounts she never touched. \n\nSince it\u2019s her weekend, I don\u2019t feel like bankrolling her vacation either. She said it\u2019s not a vacation and I said absolutely it is. If I pay half then it\u2019s making her trip cheaper. I said she should have money saved up and if not that\u2019s her problem. My daughter is pissed because my ex wife told her they couldn\u2019t go. My daughter asked why and I told her the exact reasons. That her mom is cheap and unwilling to open her accounts and I\u2019m sick of being an ATM. My daughter then asked if it was because I was going on a trip with my GF. I said I was going on a trip that weekend with my GF but that had nothing to do with it. Our trip had been planned for months and it was my money. My daughter asked if she could come on my trip and I said no. It\u2019s her moms week and she has told me countless times she doesn\u2019t like my GF. Even though my GF has been nothing but nice.

How is your child responsible for that?", "Your daughter wants it. Her father should be paying for half of it.", "It is, and I answered. Well done for noticing...", "I agree! They both suck for putting her in the middle.", "Because what else was I supposed to do? Rob my ex wife for money? \ud83d\ude02. Steal her account info and buy myself dinner with it? I vocalized it all the time. I didn\u2019t want money to be the reason I saw my daughter half the time. My ex was taking advantage of me and my wanting to make things work. It\u2019s not \u201cfiguring out a budget\u201d it\u2019s called financial abuse.

I was responding to OP.\n\nFuck a voting system. We expect bots to do so much. I responded for OP, not for some system.", "It\u2019s not punishing her to not go on a boujee resort vacation. That\u2019s spoiled kid talk. We take her on trips all the time. Going on one isn\u2019t punishment \ud83d\ude02. And especially not giving an abuser a discounted trip.", "yeaaah, riot\n\ntake that robots \ud83e\udd16"]}
