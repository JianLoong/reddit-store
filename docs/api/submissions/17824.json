We have been divorced for 3 years and the co-parenting relationship has been very difficult. We ended on bad terms and we still do not see eye to eye on parenting styles. I try to be the best dad I can, but this situation was the final straw. \n\nThe reason me and Chloe divorced was primarily finances. We both worked full time whenever we started dating. Whenever our daughter was born Chloe stopped. Then back to work till our divorce when our daughter was 11. During that time I was pretty much an ATM. My ex wife paid for literally nothing. I paid for everything including dinners, groceries, entertainment. My ex wife paid half the mortgage and that was her only financial contribution. I would bring up constantly about how I felt used. Her response was that I was the man of the family. She claimed to want a traditional marriage where the man provides. I said then I expect a traditional wife. Clean the house regularly, have a meal on the table when I get home, etc. She said she worked full time so shouldn\u2019t be expected to do all that. I said then you aren\u2019t a traditional wife but expect a financially good situation for yourself. This along with some of her \u201cfriends\u201d that I disliked, was enough for me to file for divorce. \n\nThe trip is for my daughters dance team I didn\u2019t want her to join in the first place as she wasn\u2019t even interested in dance. Just the social aspect of being on this team. I told my ex I\u2019m not paying for it so she did. The trip is to go to Florida to compete in competitions. It\u2019s like $1K and she\u2019s gotta have a chaperone. Total cost with a parent will be 1,500. Chloe asked if I would pay for half of the trip. I said absolutely not. She should have plenty saved up from the divorce and her private accounts she never touched. \n\nSince it\u2019s her weekend, I don\u2019t feel like bankrolling her vacation either. She said it\u2019s not a vacation and I said absolutely it is. If I pay half then it\u2019s making her trip cheaper. I said she should have money saved up and if not that\u2019s her problem. My daughter is pissed because my ex wife told her they couldn\u2019t go. My daughter asked why and I told her the exact reasons. That her mom is cheap and unwilling to open her accounts and I\u2019m sick of being an ATM. My daughter then asked if it was because I was going on a trip with my GF. I said I was going on a trip that weekend with my GF but that had nothing to do with it. Our trip had been planned for months and it was my money. My daughter asked if she could come on my trip and I said no. It\u2019s her moms week and she has told me countless times she doesn\u2019t like my GF. Even though my GF has been nothing but nice. Why would I subject my GF to that on her vacation? She deserves a nice trip as well. Well my daughter called me an AH and is still giving me attitude this morning.

If he pays for the other extracurriculars why is he a bad dad to not pay for this one?\n\nAlso it is the mom's week he planned a trip with his gf alone with that in mind. So why should take his kid on his trip? He is allowed to go somewhere without his kid. Also if the kid hates the gf why so gungho to go?\n\nHe is not penalizing the kid. The mom is being cheap.

This kind of childish behavior is maddening and it makes my heart break because I saw firsthand how badly it harms the kid. I never once said anything bad about him to our daughter, but she figured out on her own what kind of a jerk he really is. But that still breaks my heart.

Every time he failed our kid, I got to pickup the broken pieces and try to help her through it - and it was hard to bite my tongue about him at times when you see that. You want to rage against anyone who hurts your kid. But this man is just as petty as my ex. Never put your kid into whatever you feel about an ex. Period. That is their parent.

She should contribute towards half of the expenses that are necessary to ensure her daughter is able to have an experience playing hockey that is not affected by her parents inability to put their feelings aside. \n\nLikewise the fact that he doesn\u2019t think she needs to be doing this extra curricular activity in the first place and since her mother thinks it\u2019s okay it should be her mother who has to cover all of the expenses is like, what would be ideal in happy selfish fairytale land sure, and there\u2019s no rule saying he can\u2019t be like that - but it does make him YTA here.

If you aren\u2019t willing or able to be the chaperone then that would have to be her mother, and if she is unable to go on the trip and will suffer the social consequences and the disappointment of that then she is going to obviously infer that it is because her father is unable to put his feelings aside and think about what would be the kind action to take for the benefit of his daughter. Sometimes what is the kindest or right decision for the kids is going to end up being one that is unfair to you and part of being a good parent is being willing to do that, over and over again.", "I don\u2019t get this comment.

Just like people who don't go 50/50 aren't doormats or leeches.", "It wouldn't be physically impossible for him to take pregnancy, childbirth, and child rearing unto consideration and shut his mouth though.", "OP commented \\~3 hours before you made that comment.  Best practice, click OP, check recent comments, skim a few recent comments in the thread for the left out details.  You were made aware of the pre-existing info in the comments not 5 minutes before you made this comment, and still chose to pretend that OP said it after.  Own your mistake, move on."]}
