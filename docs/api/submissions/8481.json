Bringing narcan was an act of open-eyed love. Your sister obviously understands what you are denying - that substance use disorders are complex and the risks are huge. This isn\u2019t about trust.

Additionally, the wedding is an environment where people would be drinking, and it could have made it much harder for you to stay sober.

It isn\u2019t because I don\u2019t trust my friends to stay clean, it is because I have known people who relapse and go straight back to their ending dose, and it\u2019s deadly. One friend found out I had it and got ticked. One friend found out I had it and asked where I got it so he could get some. The reality is when it comes to substance use I\u2019d much rather be safe than sorry. I\u2019ll never be mad that I have it on hand and don\u2019t use it, but if I didn\u2019t have it and needed it I would be beating myself up. You have a right to be proud of yourself, and had BIL (he\u2019s definitely an a-h) never opened his mouth your sister could have been prepared for the worst and you\u2019d have never known. Understand that loved ones are terrified of relapse, and let\u2019s be brutally honest - it\u2019s with good reason. Statistics aren\u2019t on our side. She loves you, she wants you alive, and it takes years to build back up that trust. 6 months sober is freaking amazing, so to you it feels like a slap in the face, and I get that.

But also think of it this way, what if you do someday relapse and OD when they are around and they don\u2019t have narcan. Would you want them to live with the guilt of not being able to save you because they stopped keeping narcan in hand? The thing to remember about addiction recovery is that it isn\u2019t just about you. Your family also has to recover from the trauma of having a loved one with addiction.

NarCan can literally save the life of someone. It should be readily available.\n\nI am going with ESH except your sister.  You didn\u2019t give your sister a chance to explain her thinking.

But I also understand why she might still be worried about you, and she might carry it just as a coping mechanism for those worries. It is really hard to let down your defenses when you\u2019re on alert for a long time.

His blabbing that around drunk would have pissed me off too.", "NAH (well, husband is a bit for telling you that) but consider this. \n\nBringing Narcan is with the specific intent to **save your life**. There is no benefit to bringing it for them, except out of love for you. \n\nYou are doing great at six months, but family is often very worried and scared relating to addiction, and I don't think six months is enough time to completely let that go. \n\nImo this is not a trust issue.

They'll always be in recovery. And that's okay.\n\nBut you made this bed yourself through your own actions, so deal with it.", "ESH. Carrying narcan is a good idea even if you\u2019re not around.

There was no need to bring your addiction up and imply that they expected you to relapse.", "NAH. Your feelings are justified. Of course it feel like they don't trust you, and that can be painful. You may feel like they aren't taking you being 6 months clean seriously. \n\nOn the other hand, they may have felt like 6 months isn't long enough. If you have OD'd in the past, they may have just been worried there was a very slim possibility that you may OD again. They carried it because they love you. \n\nYou're not TA , because the way the BIL told you was so callous, of course you got upset.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nBIL should have kept that detail to himself. You overreacted. You've got 6 months' sobriety and that's good, but him bringing Narcan is not offensive, it's smart.", "YTA. I always have Narcan on me incase there is a crisis of any sort. You can't get high off it and it can save someone life. Being prepared for anyone..not just you. It's probably just instinct at this point because of her fears in the past.", "YTA.  6 months is very young in the recovery cycle. A wet reception is definitely harms way, and being fully detoxed if you were to relapse the chances you'd need Narcan are a lot higher.  They were trying to keep you involved, but CYA. \n\nRule of thumb given to most sponsees around here is match months. For every month of using, it's that many to fully restore trust with the people you hurt before choosing recovery. Best of luck on the journey!", "INFO: When you were on opiates, did you ever do anything to make them distrust you or fear for your safety? If so, it can take time for trust to be rebuilt and for fears to go away. 6 months is great! Congratulations on getting clean.

Sorry that happened.", "Honestly I think EVERYONE should carry Narcan nowadays especially at places where there\u2019s going to be partying. EVERYTHING is cut with fent now. And like others have said, 6 months is fantastic! That truly is an accomplishment, but it is still very young in recovery. My sponsee was clean off heroin for a year and overdosed out of the blue the day before thanksgiving. It took 4 doses to bring her back and really she only survived because a customer at the gas station she was dumped at had Narcan. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to call you an asshole in this situation.

Relapse is common; very few people get clean and stay clean without stumbling.\n\nYour sister was looking out for you.\n\nYour BIL is an asshole for unnecessarily bringing it up. I could choose to believe that he was trying to praise you for staying clean, but frankly, I don't feel I owe him that courtesy. I go by the rule of 3: is it kind, true, or necessary? If not at least two of three, it need not be said. What BIL said was neither necessary nor kind.\n\nYou're an asshole for taking this out on your sister. You refused to hear her out, stormed out, and seem to believe that you're entitled to her trust, which is not the case. The fact that you had to be brought back from the brink of death at least once in your life probably weighs miserably heavily on your sister, and it's going to take a lot more than a few months of being off the junk for her to forget that terror. You're going to have to earn her trust, man.", "What your BIL said to you was unfortunate.\n\nI'm going to speak honestly. I carry Narcan. Opioid addition is scary. All addiction is scary.

He has been sober for many years. He doesn't remember coding in an ambulance from alcohol poisoning, but I do. There are many things that he doesn't remember that I do. He doesn't know how terrifying it is to love someone with a substance abuse problem. I do. He doesn't know how helpless you feel. How you would do anything. How the fear consumes you, just as the substance consumes the person you love. I do. I was never ashamed of my husband. Never. He has an illness. I understood that.\n\nI am beyond proud of my husband. I don't have words to explain how proud I am. How strong I think he is. How far he has come.\n\nThe truth is, I still get terrified sometimes. It creeps up out of nowhere. It has no rhyme or reason. I don't question his sobriety. I don't question his commitment to his sobriety.

Bars where I live keep it on hand just in case.", "That's all well and good but for the BIL to show him they brought it is absolutely absurd. Calling attention to your suspicions after watching someone succeed for 6 months is just unnecessary, a bit demeaning, and can't be expected to have a good reaction. Even if he felt justified in bringing it, telling OP he brought it was just a terrible decision with an obvious result.", "This YTA", "I wish she would\u2019ve just talked to me first rather than just going behind my back and bringing it.", "I understand her reaction and while 6 months is a huge achievement(op should be very proud of herself!) in the grand scheme it\u2019s not a long time objectively to the family/friends that are hurt by addiction. Saying this as someone who went to rehab for alcoholism, it took people *years* to trust me again and many still don\u2019t, even when I\u2019m taking medication that prevents me from drinking and almost 4 years sober now. She mentions in a comment she\u2019s needed narcan before, if it were a loved one or friend I would carry it just in case-hell I\u2019d carry it in case I ran into anyone ODing. \n\n\n\n\nThey all went about telling her the completely wrong way, but I don\u2019t think they have narcan to embarrass her or shame her/hold her addiction over her head, they probably have it because they love her. Obviously idk the family or their true motives but if it were me, I\u2019d rather piss my sibling off than have them wind up dead. Life is too short to hold onto these resentments and i think once tempers cool down, this issue can be talked about and resolved", "This is the answer.", "Narcan is used for when someone ODs right?", "I mean sure. I basically lived in a crackhouse for two years.", "No, not everyone should carry narcan, there's a whole lot of reasons why, you can search Google and Reddit yourself.", "Yes it really does should have put that in your post.", "It does. Hon, they brought something to save your life if it was in danger. I know 6 months sounds like a lifetime to you, but it is such a short time. Relapse is very common at that stage. They had it because they love you and value your life. YTA, I'm sorry.", "I\u2019ve been off opiates for ten years and my wife still keeps it in the house, and I wouldn\u2019t be upset to learn that any of my relatives do also. Honestly more people should have it with them all the time. It saves lives. And I don\u2019t think your reaction reinforces that. \n\nBut I\u2019m still sort of a NAH because you\u2019re obviously free to be where you want when you want for any reason.\n\nAnd congrats on six months!", "Yes it does. You aren't innocent at all in this matter. There's an insanely high probability you'll end up relapsing at some point if you've needed narcan in the past.\n\nYour sister doesn't trust you for a reason. Maybe you should consider the reasons why and put yourself in her place.", "Info: Where was the wedding and how far away is the nearest hospital?", "Hmmm sorry OP, I think it does. I\u2019m going to say NAH. I understand why you were hurt - it must have felt insulting. I don\u2019t fault you for getting upset and leaving - it wasn\u2019t cool, but sometimes it\u2019s better to just remove yourself. Finding out about it when people are getting a bit sloppy is a bad way to hear the news, so I get why you left. I read another comment where you said you \u201clived in a crack house for two years\u201d. You\u2019re still at the beginning of this journey, and weddings bring up lots of emotions, so I think it\u2019s honestly smart your sister had Narcan on deck. It\u2019s better to have some and not need it than to need it snd not have it. Six months is a long time (and I commend you!!), but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s nearly enough time to undo that image of you in their minds. On the positive side, you\u2019ve cleared a big hurdle and shown them that you can stay sober at a big party. I suggest apologizing to your sister and having a very open discussion about your journey and just clear the air. It\u2019s unfortunate interaction for a wedding, but it doesn\u2019t sound like a ending. Good luck!!!", "I\u2019m sorry, but it does. \n\nYour sister was probably scared shitless either hearing that you had to have that happen or having to do it herself if she did or straight up just knowing you would\u2019ve likely died without it. \n\nIt\u2019s fantastic you\u2019ve been clean for as long as you have, and I\u2019m sure your sister is incredibly proud of you and grateful for that. But I\u2019m also sure she\u2019s going to have the terror of hearing you nearly died stick with her for a long time, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s going to make sure she has that around to try and avoid risking needing it and not having it. \n\nAddiction is a disease, and her caring for your well-being isn\u2019t her distrusting you or not believing in you. She just cares. And she\u2019s probably somewhat traumatised from the idea of nearly losing you. So try to cut her a little slack and see where she is likely coming from? \n\nAlthough what her husband said and how was kinda crappy. \n\nBut yeah, I don\u2019t think this stems from distrust, more just care. I would be glad you have someone that cares as much as she does!", "I understand but when you have been dealing with an addict who lies to get a fix, it takes more than six months to reset the relationship. Something's have to happen on other people's timeline.", "What would you have said, or how would you have texted, if she had?  She likely thought you wouldn't take it well.... but in reality she had a plan to save your life!", "See the thing is you burnt alot of bridges and cannot be trusted yet, people don't forget the past and you don't just get to wipe the slate clean, 6 months is not long for an addict and many relapse.", "It's possible she was worried that your addict brain would use it as an excuse for it to be okay to relapse. You know, \"It's just one, just so I can have a good time. Just to loosen up a bit. If anything goes wrong, sis has narcan, so I should be good, etc., etc...\" I'm not saying it's true at all about what your mental process would be, but I can see how your sister might think that the fear of OD'ing helps you stay straight, and to not want to be the one to remove that barrier between you and drugs.\n\nFrankly if I knew someone I cared about was doing basically any drug, given the prevalence of fentanyl these days, I would probably always have some narcan with me. I know people who carry it every where they go in case literal strangers need it. I would try not to make this about trust or betrayal, when it's more likely about love and care. Easier said than done of course, but all the same. Do your best to assume positive intent, just as you're hoping your family does their best to assume you also have positive intent.", "This is a tough position to be in for everyone. I feel like this is mushed between ESH and NAH. \n\nYour sister cares about you. I also see why you'd be upset. I can understand why she'd be resistant to discussing it with you. BIL is definitely an asshole.", "Even (especially) if you were full-on using you would have told her not to bring it, though. \n\nI get the impression that it hasn't sunk in how much your addiction affects your loved ones.", "Yeah, thank you for adding this. You hit the nail on the head. I agree \ud83d\udcaf", "Yes", "I might cut them some slack then. You never know how a stressful event like that may affect someone. They were just prepared. It wasn't necessary to tell you, though. It seems like they were just relieved at how well everything went. NAH", "NAH. As long as your on any dangerous drug like that its worrying. Things can get laced, its really easy to go back, and addicts can be really good at pretending to be sober. Its gonna take awhile for their worries to dissapate. Especially if theyve already lost others to addiction or theyve seen what can happen. Be careful OP I believe in you! You will stay sober and if you dont, you will be able to get sober again.", "I genuinely tried to google this after reading your comment and didn\u2019t get anywhere\u2026 just a lot of articles saying it\u2019s a good idea if you have a friend/loved one using opiates or come into contact with community members vulnerable to overdose\u2026\n\nWhy is it a bad idea?", "Where did OP say they did anything beyond bieng addicted to a substance. Not every addict steals and lies.", "He also stated he lived in a crack house for two years. And anyone who has dealt with a serious addict knows they will do anything to get a fix.", "Every addict lies. Every one of them.", "Even sugar addicts? Shopping addicts? Caffeine addicts?"]}
