Additionally, the wedding is an environment where people would be drinking, and it could have made it much harder for you to stay sober.

It isn\u2019t because I don\u2019t trust my friends to stay clean, it is because I have known people who relapse and go straight back to their ending dose, and it\u2019s deadly. One friend found out I had it and got ticked. One friend found out I had it and asked where I got it so he could get some. The reality is when it comes to substance use I\u2019d much rather be safe than sorry. I\u2019ll never be mad that I have it on hand and don\u2019t use it, but if I didn\u2019t have it and needed it I would be beating myself up. You have a right to be proud of yourself, and had BIL (he\u2019s definitely an a-h) never opened his mouth your sister could have been prepared for the worst and you\u2019d have never known. Understand that loved ones are terrified of relapse, and let\u2019s be brutally honest - it\u2019s with good reason. Statistics aren\u2019t on our side. She loves you, she wants you alive, and it takes years to build back up that trust. 6 months sober is freaking amazing, so to you it feels like a slap in the face, and I get that.

Would you want them to live with the guilt of not being able to save you because they stopped keeping narcan in hand? The thing to remember about addiction recovery is that it isn\u2019t just about you. Your family also has to recover from the trauma of having a loved one with addiction.

NarCan can literally save the life of someone. It should be readily available.\n\nI am going with ESH except your sister.  You didn\u2019t give your sister a chance to explain her thinking.  She almost certainly acted out of genuine care for you.

But I also understand why she might still be worried about you, and she might carry it just as a coping mechanism for those worries. It is really hard to let down your defenses when you\u2019re on alert for a long time.

His blabbing that around drunk would have pissed me off too.", "NAH (well, husband is a bit for telling you that) but consider this. \n\nBringing Narcan is with the specific intent to **save your life**. There is no benefit to bringing it for them, except out of love for you. \n\nYou are doing great at six months, but family is often very worried and scared relating to addiction, and I don't think six months is enough time to completely let that go. \n\nImo this is not a trust issue.

They'll always be in recovery. And that's okay.\n\nBut you made this bed yourself through your own actions, so deal with it.", "ESH. Carrying narcan is a good idea even if you\u2019re not around.

There was no need to bring your addiction up and imply that they expected you to relapse.", "NAH. Your feelings are justified. Of course it feel like they don't trust you, and that can be painful. You may feel like they aren't taking you being 6 months clean seriously. \n\nOn the other hand, they may have felt like 6 months isn't long enough. If you have OD'd in the past, they may have just been worried there was a very slim possibility that you may OD again. They carried it because they love you. \n\nYou're not TA , because the way the BIL told you was so callous, of course you got upset.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nBIL should have kept that detail to himself. You overreacted. You've got 6 months' sobriety and that's good, but him bringing Narcan is not offensive, it's smart.", "YTA. I always have Narcan on me incase there is a crisis of any sort. You can't get high off it and it can save someone life. Being prepared for anyone..not just you. It's probably just instinct at this point because of her fears in the past.", "YTA.  6 months is very young in the recovery cycle. A wet reception is definitely harms way, and being fully detoxed if you were to relapse the chances you'd need Narcan are a lot higher.  They were trying to keep you involved, but CYA. \n\nRule of thumb given to most sponsees around here is match months. For every month of using, it's that many to fully restore trust with the people you hurt before choosing recovery. Best of luck on the journey!", "INFO: When you were on opiates, did you ever do anything to make them distrust you or fear for your safety? If so, it can take time for trust to be rebuilt and for fears to go away. 6 months is great! Congratulations on getting clean.

Sorry that happened.", "Honestly I think EVERYONE should carry Narcan nowadays especially at places where there\u2019s going to be partying. EVERYTHING is cut with fent now. And like others have said, 6 months is fantastic! That truly is an accomplishment, but it is still very young in recovery. My sponsee was clean off heroin for a year and overdosed out of the blue the day before thanksgiving. It took 4 doses to bring her back and really she only survived because a customer at the gas station she was dumped at had Narcan. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to call you an asshole in this situation.

Relapse is common; very few people get clean and stay clean without stumbling.\n\nYour sister was looking out for you.\n\nYour BIL is an asshole for unnecessarily bringing it up. I could choose to believe that he was trying to praise you for staying clean, but frankly, I don't feel I owe him that courtesy. I go by the rule of 3: is it kind, true, or necessary? If not at least two of three, it need not be said. What BIL said was neither necessary nor kind.\n\nYou're an asshole for taking this out on your sister. You refused to hear her out, stormed out, and seem to believe that you're entitled to her trust, which is not the case. The fact that you had to be brought back from the brink of death at least once in your life probably weighs miserably heavily on your sister, and it's going to take a lot more than a few months of being off the junk for her to forget that terror. You're going to have to earn her trust, man.", "What your BIL said to you was unfortunate.\n\nI'm going to speak honestly. I carry Narcan. Opioid addition is scary. All addiction is scary.

He has been sober for many years. He doesn't remember coding in an ambulance from alcohol poisoning, but I do. There are many things that he doesn't remember that I do. He doesn't know how terrifying it is to love someone with a substance abuse problem. I do. He doesn't know how helpless you feel. How you would do anything. How the fear consumes you, just as the substance consumes the person you love. I do. I was never ashamed of my husband. Never. He has an illness. I understood that.\n\nI am beyond proud of my husband. I don't have words to explain how proud I am. How strong I think he is. How far he has come.\n\nThe truth is, I still get terrified sometimes. It creeps up out of nowhere. It has no rhyme or reason. I don't question his sobriety. I don't question his commitment to his sobriety.

Bars where I live keep it on hand just in case.", "That's all well and good but for the BIL to show him they brought it is absolutely absurd. Calling attention to your suspicions after watching someone succeed for 6 months is just unnecessary, a bit demeaning, and can't be expected to have a good reaction.

Saying this as someone who went to rehab for alcoholism, it took people *years* to trust me again and many still don\u2019t, even when I\u2019m taking medication that prevents me from drinking and almost 4 years sober now. She mentions in a comment she\u2019s needed narcan before, if it were a loved one or friend I would carry it just in case-hell I\u2019d carry it in case I ran into anyone ODing. \n\n\n\n\nThey all went about telling her the completely wrong way, but I don\u2019t think they have narcan to embarrass her or shame her/hold her addiction over her head, they probably have it because they love her. Obviously idk the family or their true motives but if it were me, I\u2019d rather piss my sibling off than have them wind up dead. Life is too short to hold onto these resentments and i think once tempers cool down, this issue can be talked about and resolved", "This is the answer.", "Narcan is used for when someone ODs right?", "I mean sure. I basically lived in a crackhouse for two years.", "No, not everyone should carry narcan, there's a whole lot of reasons why, you can search Google and Reddit yourself.", "Yes it really does should have put that in your post.", "It does. Hon, they brought something to save your life if it was in danger. I know 6 months sounds like a lifetime to you, but it is such a short time. Relapse is very common at that stage. They had it because they love you and value your life. YTA, I'm sorry.", "I\u2019ve been off opiates for ten years and my wife still keeps it in the house, and I wouldn\u2019t be upset to learn that any of my relatives do also.

And I don\u2019t think your reaction reinforces that. \n\nBut I\u2019m still sort of a NAH because you\u2019re obviously free to be where you want when you want for any reason.\n\nAnd congrats on six months!", "Yes it does. You aren't innocent at all in this matter. There's an insanely high probability you'll end up relapsing at some point if you've needed narcan in the past.\n\nYour sister doesn't trust you for a reason. Maybe you should consider the reasons why and put yourself in her place.", "Info: Where was the wedding and how far away is the nearest hospital?", "Hmmm sorry OP, I think it does. I\u2019m going to say NAH. I understand why you were hurt - it must have felt insulting. I don\u2019t fault you for getting upset and leaving - it wasn\u2019t cool, but sometimes it\u2019s better to just remove yourself. Finding out about it when people are getting a bit sloppy is a bad way to hear the news, so I get why you left. You\u2019re still at the beginning of this journey, and weddings bring up lots of emotions, so I think it\u2019s honestly smart your sister had Narcan on deck. It\u2019s better to have some and not need it than to need it snd not have it. I read another comment where you said you \u201clived in a crack house for two years\u201d. Six months is a long time (and I commend you!!), but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s nearly enough time to undo that image of you in their minds. On the positive side, you\u2019ve cleared a big hurdle and shown them that you can stay sober at a big party. I suggest apologizing to your sister and having a very open discussion about your journey and just clear the air. It\u2019s unfortunate interaction for a wedding, but it doesn\u2019t sound like a ending. Good luck!!!", "I\u2019m sorry, but it does. \n\nYour sister was probably scared shitless either hearing that you had to have that happen or having to do it herself if she did or straight up just knowing you would\u2019ve likely died without it. \n\nIt\u2019s fantastic you\u2019ve been clean for as long as you have, and I\u2019m sure your sister is incredibly proud of you and grateful for that. But I\u2019m also sure she\u2019s going to have the terror of hearing you nearly died stick with her for a long time, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s going to make sure she has that around to try and avoid risking needing it and not having it. \n\nAddiction is a disease, and her caring for your well-being isn\u2019t her distrusting you or not believing in you. She just cares. And she\u2019s probably somewhat traumatised from the idea of nearly losing you. So try to cut her a little slack and see where she is likely coming from? \n\nAlthough what her husband said and how was kinda crappy. \n\nBut yeah, I don\u2019t think this stems from distrust, more just care. I would be glad you have someone that cares as much as she does!", "I understand but when you have been dealing with an addict who lies to get a fix, it takes more than six months to reset the relationship.

She likely thought you wouldn't take it well.... but in reality she had a plan to save your life!", "See the thing is you burnt alot of bridges and cannot be trusted yet, people don't forget the past and you don't just get to wipe the slate clean, 6 months is not long for an addict and many relapse.", "It's possible she was worried that your addict brain would use it as an excuse for it to be okay to relapse. You know, \"It's just one, just so I can have a good time. Just to loosen up a bit. If anything goes wrong, sis has narcan, so I should be good, etc., etc...\" I'm not saying it's true at all about what your mental process would be, but I can see how your sister might think that the fear of OD'ing helps you stay straight, and to not want to be the one to remove that barrier between you and drugs.\n\nFrankly if I knew someone I cared about was doing basically any drug, given the prevalence of fentanyl these days, I would probably always have some narcan with me. I know people who carry it every where they go in case literal strangers need it. I would try not to make this about trust or betrayal, when it's more likely about love and care. Easier said than done of course, but all the same. Do your best to assume positive intent, just as you're hoping your family does their best to assume you also have positive intent.", "This is a tough position to be in for everyone.

Actions have consequences. \n\nHowever its a bit more understandable considering BIL tried to turn your addiction and the bringing of the narcan into a bad joke. It was tasteless and obviously he could not read his audience because I can't see anybody who would appreciate being the butt of that joke.

You have to prioritize protecting yourself regardless of the circumstances.  Given that you're in a relatively young stage of your sobriety, it can take some time to figure out how to manage that in normal life. \n* Your BIL is TOTALLY an AH for coming up to you (while drunk, I might add!) to bring up a worst case scenario about your addiction.  It was cruel and unnecessary.

Speaking from my damage from my sibling, I was fully ok with not having them in my life after a couple bad relapses. I'm so proud of them for hitting their one year mark and I've cautiously been allowing them back in. I cried because I got my sibling back. I missed them so much, and the version of them that used was a stranger. \n\nThe NarCan isn't because she doesn't trust her brother, the sober you.

It\u2019s not always a linear process.", "I guess ESH except your sister because EVERY EVENT in EVERY VENUE should have Narcan. Full stop. The opioid epidemic is the reality we live in. BIL was an AH for what he said but not at all an AH for having narcan on hand. Also, 6 months just isn\u2019t very long and a major party is a potential trigger so that\u2019s a valid precaution for your sister to take. She obviously felt it was necessary and just wants to keep you alive. You admitted to have needed narcan and living in a crack house so her fears are warranted. I think you owed it to your sister to stay at her freaking wedding after what you\u2019ve put her and your whole family through. Addiction is a disease but you have to take responsibility for the impacts you\u2019ve had on others.

It's okay to feel offended, but it's not a harmful thing for her to do, if that makes sense. \n\nHowever, BIL's comment was an AH thing to say. You're allowed to be upset about something like that, to try to take space by going to the bathroom and then leaving when you were further upset.

My BIL has a lot of issues right now and during his cycles of abuse he has done a lot of things that make it hard to believe he is sober.  So in the back of my mind I constantly have questions about his recovery.  I also do things that help protect him and myself, not letting him have my debit cards, use my car unsupervised and etc.  I cannot say what experiences you have had with your family OP but addiction is hard on everyone.  Also, they did not check your pockets, they did not question you up to the wedding about not using, the only thing they did ( outside of your brother in laws comment which I will get to ) is bring the thing that can keep you alive if you OD.  This leads me to believe that there were points in your life you may have needed or were in danger of needing Narcan.   \n\n\nI don't think you are TA because you have every right to leave a place that makes you uncomfortable.  You also have done A LOT of work to keep yourself clean and have that being questioned can really hurt.   \n\n\nI don't think your BIL is TA, he might be but its kinda eh and a matter of perspective. He was drunk, at his own wedding.  While his comment was not appropriate he probably thought he was complimenting you.  Saying the wrong thing or a stupid thing does not always make you TA, it makes you wrong and need to apologize.   \n\n\nI don't think you Sis is the TA either, bringing Narcan makes sense.  Addiction is a hard fight and there are bumps, being prepared is common sense. She cared about you enough to know that being in a party atmosphere might be one temptation to many.    \n\n\nOP, great work on your recovery, no matter what else please note you are doing an amazing job.  Also please try to frame this instance for what it is, a loving sister that cares about you living.  If she had you walk her down the Aisle i dare say she cares a lot about you.", "YTA. Your sister brought something to her wedding to save your life, and somehow you turned it around and made it an insult to you. When she remembers her wedding day now, she will remember you walking out of it, all because she was thoughtful. Because you can\u2019t be clear eyed about what you have put your family through. Six months! I have salad dressing in my fridge older than 6 months. I wish you the very best in your recovery. But I would guess you\u2019re going to be seeing a lot less of your sister.", "Gentle YTA. \n\nInstead of shunning you like MANY families do with addicts, they brought something specifically intended to save your life, just in case. \n\nI do think they shouldn't have done it the way they did, they should have just congratulated you on your sobriety. \n\nI know how much shame goes into being an addict, and how important it is for loved ones to be trusting. At the end of the day, they went out of their way to get the very thing that could save your life. They didn't keep you from the wedding, sounds like they gave you full reign to do as you pleased and made a very untactful statement. \n\nIt's reasonable for you to be miffed about their approach, but not many people would have made sure they could save their addict families life in case of an OD. You're very lucky in that regard. Some people think narcan should be banned and let addicts die. These people had good intentions, and a bad approach (while drunk it seems, haven't we all said something all the way wrong while drunk?)\n\nCongratulations on your sobriety. I'm rooting for you. I'm sorry this hurt you.", "ESH. Her husband shouldn\u2019t have mentioned that to you, but it sounds like he was drunk and just blurted it out without thinking. It sounds like he was in a drunken emotional state. You suck here for being mad over the fact that you have people that care about you in the unlikely event something happened. I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re in recovery but it hasn\u2019t even been a year, it\u2019d be insulting if this happened a few years from now. They didn\u2019t do it because they hate you, they care for you and would like you to keep being alive. For perspective, my boyfriend overdosed while claiming to me that he was clean for 5 months. I found his body hours too late when I got home from work, and often think about how if I was home and had narcan he\u2019d still be here. It sucks.", "Yta it\u2019s only been six months, honestly their intentions were good.", "Yikes. YTA. As someone that is dependent on morphine and Percocet due to health issues we have narcan at home and we carry it everywhere. I think everyone should have narcan at home- it should be accessible to everyone. Why? Bc it can save someone\u2019s life. If you had said they brought opioids and started doing lines with them then I\u2019d say. NTA and wtf but your fam looking out for you isn\u2019t a bad thing.", "YTA. They don't trust you because you've demonstrated previously that you can't be trusted. Its going to take longer than 6 months to earn any sort of trust back.", "I\u2019m a little conflicted. Because Um I carry Narcan at all times. I went to training and saw how quickly it can save a life. But I think him telling you like that was a total AH move.  You basically having a tantrum when your sister was an uou sly just very concerned for your well-being was an AH move as well. This was a poorly handled situation. Also 18 months clean is an accomplishment BUT stressful situations (even happy ones like a wedding) can cause relapses.", "First, congratulations on 6 months-that\u2019s AMAZING!!\n\nBut, YTA, the reason they brought Narcan is love. You don\u2019t know what it is like to be the loved one of an addict. Laying awake at night wondering where they are, what they\u2019re doing and if they\u2019re even alive. It\u2019s soul crushing. There\u2019s literally nothing you can do to make them stop using, it\u2019s completely helpless. \n\nBe grateful you have someone who\u2019s still there and go apologize. Immediately.", "6 months clean is not enough time to build trust back.  Especially as you're around alcohol.  You need to respect and understand that. \nYta", "YTA. Narcan is not about distrust, it's about saving lives. My husband carries naloxone everywhere, because we live in a high risk city.", "NTA for you and hopefully your sister.  Your BIL though is totally disrespectful and inappropriate.  \n\nCongratulations on your sobriety.  I understands it's a continuing struggle, and I think it's thoughtful that your sister wanted to try to keep you safe.", "YTA. \n\nYou aren\u2019t entitled to trust after just six months. \n\nYou may not realise this, but addicts cause a lot of pain, steal, tell a lot of lies and basically become incredibly shit people to those who love them. Don\u2019t know your personal history but that\u2019s been my experience of it with family who are addicts. \n\nWhen you\u2019re getting clean you can apologise and be forgiven, but people don\u2019t forget the damage done. \n\nYes you\u2019ve been clean, but they know there\u2019s a real possibility of relapse. They also don\u2019t know you\u2019re clean, because addicts lie and they just can\u2019t be sure. \n\nSo you think they don\u2019t trust you? You\u2019re probably right. Because trust has to be re-earned after addiction.\n\nBil should have kept it to himself though.", "You left because you felt overwhelmed in that moment, right? If you were informed about it as a joke, I can imagine that hurting. So, you're not necessarily an asshole for leaving.\n\nNor are they necessarily assholes. Firstly, if they said it jokingly, could it have been from a place of discomfort? You would have to talk to them about that to understand their perspective. Secondly, I don't think this is an issue of trust, however. Narcan can be life-saving and a logical backup option if there has been use in the past. I see it as a caring thing for someone to have it as a backup, whether they suspect someone of taking certain meds or not.\n\nI think it's worth you guys sitting down and having a chat about how that made you feel and how they feel (as, it sounds like they have previously have been concerned about you. And if they still are, that's okay. Thats very normal). :)", "YTA, sure they brought it for you and I\u2019m sure they do trust you but it just takes one relapse. \n\nI am personally under the belief narcan should be in all first aid kits because it\u2019s so important to save lives, anyone else at the wedding could potentially be an abuser and you just don\u2019t know what anyone does behind closed doors. Even someone on the street having an OD it\u2019s good to have it. I knew a guy who kept it in his car cause he was always around people who dabbled and didn\u2019t want to feel the loss or regret of what if we had it. I get where you\u2019re coming from but at the end of the day they love you and would regret not having it that one time.", "NAH - I can understand why this would hit you the wrong way. but.. \n\nNarcan is first aid. They didn't bring a security guard and handcuffs cause they don't trust you, they brought *life-saving medicine* because if the worst should happen, their primary focus would be to *save your life*. It's cheap, easy to use, and life-saving. If I had a loved one with a history of addiction or overdose, I'd carry it with me at all times. If the worst did happen, and they had no access to narcan because they were worried how you'd feel about them having it, and lost you that night, they'd never be able to forgive themselves.", "YTA. Nobody six-months sober gets to self-righteously whine about not being \u201dtrusted.\u201d", "The BIL shouldn\u2019t have said that, but being an addict didn\u2019t just affect you.  Your family had to live through a lot of crap as well.  Like it or not, you have to re-earn their trust.  It doesn\u2019t mean they think you will fail or aren\u2019t proud of the steps you are taking.  YTA for not seeing thing from her point of view.", "YTA.\n\nI understand where you're coming from, but I don't think this was coming from a place of mistrust. Relapses are incredibly common, and you were approaching a major family event. Recovery can be bumpy, and you're still in a vulnerable state.\n\nYour sister knows your history, she knows what kind of risks are associated with it. She chose to have narcan on hand *just in case* something happened. It's like having an emergency kit in your vehicle, or carrying an epipen. You hope you never need it, but it's a literal lifesaver if you do.\n\nHer husband didn't really need to make that comment though, I'll give ya that.\n\nI truly hope you're successful in your recovery and wish you nothing but the best. Congrats, man. Keep it up.", "YTA. \n\nIf you have any friends who use opiates or if you\u2019re in a program you are aware of how fragile sobriety can be, especially, early sobriety. They were just thinking ahead. Your BIL shouldn\u2019t have said anything but it was for your own good.", "The only fuckin\u2019 asshole here is the BIL. I\u2019m so sorry\ud83d\udc95 So, I can see both your POV and your sisters. Fuck dude. Six months!!!!! That\u2019s HUGE. Your sister loves you and it was simply a preventative, caring gesture. My sister has a history as well and I would do the same. Not because I don\u2019t trust her, but out of protectiveness. I hope everything turns out okay. That being said? I absolutely would be feeling the same way you did and would probably leave as well. \ud83d\udc95please know you\u2019re loved", "How awful, you have people who love you and want you to live. \n\nYTA and also everyone should carry narcan", "NAH: This wasn\u2019t how they should have told you and it might have been a better conversation ahead of time but it was good that they had it.", "Mmm, gentle YTA considering you have had to be revived with Narcan before.\n\nHaving a loved one overdose and be on the brink of death and needing to be brought back with Narcan is quite traumatic, let alone everything else that\u2019s associated with being an addict. There were no malicious intentions with having it, the only reason why it was there was to save you and it\u2019s honestly a good thing to have handy because you just never know. \n\nBIL sucks for how you were told, and you really shouldn\u2019t have been told at all. But I fully understand why they had it on standby.\n\nBest of luck with your continued sobriety.", "YTA they were not distrustful of you they were being prepared. It is no different then if they made sure there was an epi pen if you had allergies to food. It is better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. Had it not been for a drunken slip you would never even have known.  Apologize and thank them for inviting you and thinking of your well-being", "YTA they trusted you enough to not only attend the wedding but to walk her down the aisle, and your mad that they brought something that should you have a relapse, which happens All The Time, 6 months is Nothing when it comes to sobriety groups, and you get pissed about it? For god sake they bought something that would save your life if it came to it.\n\nPeople relapse. It happens. Be glad they included you in their life-no, in their WEDDING- despite your history and are clearly trying to be supportive if cautious", "Kindly and jently YTA. They love you, that's why they were prepared. It may seem as an atac  for you, but they did it out of love for you. BIL shouldn't have told you, that's sure. That was a mistake in his part. \nYou did a good job staying clean so far, and it's okay you reacted, you are still vulnerable. But you should talk to your sister and clear things up. She loves you and wants to protect you, even if she might tried it in the wrong way. I'm sure she is proud of you and she does trust you.", "For the sake of the post, YTA. However, I say that with all the love and understanding I can express. I am 10 yrs sober from opiates. I have been on both sides of your situation. I have been the addict and I have been the Mom of an addict. 6 months is an amazing accomplishment and, by all means, you should be very proud of yourself! Keep going! On the other hand, you need to realize that trust is going to take time. Be honest with yourself, how many times did they hear from you that you are \u201cfine\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m good\u201d. I haven\u2019t met an addict that hasn\u2019t burned bridges that need to be rebuilt. The fact that they brought narcan, in my opinion, shows that they love you and they are not ready to lose you. Again, in my opinion, your sister is supportive of you by having you walk her down the aisle, that is a huge honor and shows respect. Have patience with yourself and others as far as healing. I am very proud of you and you are a strong woman, the best of luck with your sobriety!", "I don't think YTA. Overreacting, yes, a little. I think they got it as a precaution because they care for you. I don't think they did it out of spite.", "Gonna go with NTA because the AH is the BIL. Narcan is a great thing to have at a party, whether you know an addict or not. ANYONE can overdose if they take any party drugs, you never know what stuff is laced with these days. Your sister was not wrong to have the narcan there in order to save a life, whether that is your life or not. \n\nYour reaction wasn\u2019t the best but I can empathize with where you are coming from, being proud of your sobriety but feeling judged and scrutinized by your family. It seems they mean well but your BIL shot below the belt with his comment to you. He singled you out specifically and that was not cool. \n\nBest wishes on your sobriety.", "ESH. I can't say I blame them for wanting to be prepared, but joking about it to you was an AH move. They could have never mentioned it and been happy they never had to use it.\n\nAs a recovering addict, you need to be prepared for and accept that people won't trust you for a long time, and they have good reason not to.", "YTA\n\nBecause it really must have been awesome worrying about you so much that they have had Narcan on hand to save your life for god know how long before this. They seem to have given you a break and not banned you from their lives for the your own addiction causing disruption\u2026 maybe show a little grace. \n\nDrunken BIL could have been less of a ding-ding but I think I your sister didn\u2019t deserve drama at her own wedding either.

My child, an epidemiologist, carries Narcan/naloxone  all the time because of finding someone passed out on a subway platform, and the police did not have any with them, when they responded. And don't be picking up stray pieces of currency, either. There can be enough Fentanyl stuck to a dollar bill to be fatal. Mild YTA for not crediting your in-laws with having higher, humanitarian motivations, but they suck, too, if they don't have that higher concern. Drug overdoses are a critical societal problem that affects us all. Congratulations on getting clean!", "I agree with what everyone else is saying.  \u201cHope for the best but be prepared for the worst.\u201d Your sister had the Narcan out of love.  I am fortunate to not have had to deal with any close relatives or friends with addiction problems.  But when I read about celebrities that have battled addictions, I see how fragile sobriety can be.  Robert Downey, Jr. broke my heart so many times in and out of rehab; I\u2019m so glad he has finally stayed sober and fulfilled his potential.  But then when Phillip Seymour Hoffman died from an OD after over 20+ years of sobriety, I learned how truly powerful an addiction can be over common sense.  So stay strong and do the work and remember that there are people that care.", "NTA. They can bring narcan to make sure everyone is safe but the audacity of your BIL coming up to you to express that he is happy he didn't have to USE IT ON YOU after you have been clean for 6 months (so proud of you by the way) how disrespectful. That's awful. Congrats on being clean, you deserve this life and I hope you take care of yourself.", "That was kind of an AH thing to say to you. Very condescending. Your sister bring it was fine if she was concerned, but there was no reason for your BIL to rub it in your face. I would have been offended as well.\n\nNTA", "That they even thought to bring narcan shows you\u2019ve done enough in the past to damage their trust in you. 6 months of sobriety (congratulations!!!!!) doesn\u2019t just negate those previous actions.

They clearly love you and want you around so stick with it \ud83d\ude3b", "NAH. You had every right to be upset by that and leave. But I also understand why they brought the narcan.

I keep narcan close all the time bc I recognize addiction is extremely difficult. She loves you so she wanted to make sure you would be safe in a space she hosted, no matter where in your recovery journey you are you'd be okay.

I'm sorry you were made to feel belittled by something that should have only been an act of care.", "You've OD'd before, you're six months (good for you!) into recovery after years of addiction (very early in recovery) and making them worry sick about you as you lived in a crack house. It is a party setting. With an addict bringing Narcan to a party like that is like bringing an inhaler for an asthmatic on a hike or Epipen for someone with food allergies to a party. It will take years for trust to be rebuilt. They got it to save your hide. Relapsing is very common. You made their wedding about you and your feelings. Part of recovery is taking responsibility including I screwed up and gave them a reason to not trust me and they need to heal on their time.", "I can't vote. I just celebrated 28 years coke free. I think you should forgive both if them. 6 months is great and congratulations \ud83c\udf8a however you have history. They were put through hell and others because of your addiction. It's going to take years to build a high level of trust again ( brother just started talking me 2 years ago). I think the fact that they love you so much is why they brought narcan. They were afraid yet still wanted you there.   You have to rebuild your relationships with entire family and friends. Day by day for everything but guess what? You got this!!!", "YTA. Congratulations on your progress and being clean for 6 months, I'm incredibly proud of you for that, however, being clean now doesn't erase your past as an addict. Out of interest, have you accidentally OD'd at family events in the past? If so, it makes A LOT of sense why even with you being clean, your sister took precautions. Addicts often relapse, mistakes happen, that's ok and she is allowed to take precautions to ensure her wedding doesn't end early because you accidentally OD at it. Part of the recovery process with addiction is regaining the trust of others, you have only been clean for 6 months (again this is AMAZING) but you were most likely an addict for longer, people need time to move past that, 6 months isn't enough time for most people. I'm guessing you've hurt your sister during your addiction and while I'm sure she is so proud of you for getting clean, she can't just forget what happened in case it happens again. She has to protect herself to some degree. You need to earn people's trust back by remaining clean, by working hard and accepting that you will be treated a bit differently, like people having narcan on hand (to be fair, it's better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it). It sounds like your sister is your biggest supporter in your journey, don't blow that now because you're upset she isn't treating you like you weren't an addict in the first place.", "I think almost everyone should carry Narcan.

But YTA for how you reacted to it; I suspect them having it on hand was more out of a place of love than mistrust.", "Gently, YTA and I would also say that you are clearly still very much in the process of reckoning with the reality of your addiction and how it impacted you and the people around you. The fact that you got so offended about them taking a very reasonable step to potentially save your life shows that you're in denial about some of this. They were out of line for mentioning it to you, that understandably felt unsupportive and hurtful to you, but with addiction you have to earn back trust and it can take awhile. Them not trusting you YET is not a judgment on you as a human being or a sign that they don't love and support you. You've obviously worked really hard to get clean and stay sober for 6 months and I'm glad you were able to be there for your sister. You can and should tell your brother that his words were uncalled for, but flouncing off was out of line.", "[removed]", "NAH. I get why it caused offense in the moment.

My husband relapsed three or four times before he successfully quit smoking, and even now, I worry that when he\u2019s around his family who are chain smokers, he\u2019ll start again and need to go through the entire quitting process all over again. I self harmed daily from ages 14-20, successfully stayed away from cutting for twelve years although I still scratched myself, deliberately hit brick walls and occasionally deliberately burned myself, and all of a sudden life stress ramped up a couple years ago and I was back to regular cutting which has been an absolute bitch to stop. \n\nMy husband doesn\u2019t like me going \u201cso how are you doing with smoking cravings\u201d and I don\u2019t like having my arms and ankles scrutinised for cuts but I realise that we both have the runs on the board to make it completely logical that our families will be concerned about us.

She had Narcan there to protect YOU! If she wanted to protect herself, she could not have invited you at all, but she did invite, and then because she loves you and wanted you there, she took precautions on how to best keep you safe at her wedding; probably thinking 'I have Narcan, I can protect and help my sibling if need me. Better to be safe than sorry'\n\nAnd then you blew up at her, stormed out of her wedding reception.

I think it should be more accessible than first aid kits. There's no reason to not have it, because you never know when it could literally save a life.

I get while you would be offended, but at the same time, your sister loves you enough to think about your safety even on her big day. As a pharmacist, I find it sad that theres so much stigma around Narcan when really what its like, is just a first aid kit. Something handy to have on hand in any scenario. Having that doesnt mean she doesnt trust you, she just wants to make sure you're safe. It's like you walking on a tightrope and her trusting your abilities and knowing you can definitely make it to the other side, but putting a net below just in case. Of course Im not your sister so I dont know her rationale, but I hope that could potentially give you some insight. Congrats on being opiate-free!", "Soft YTA and I encourage you to apologize.\n\nYou're recently sober, you've needed it to be revived before, and most of all *they love you*. It was a considerate act after living in fear for your life when you were using. Good for them for having it on hand to help anyone in need. Hopefully you'll never use again but that fear they have for your safety may never go away. Don't let your pride or hurt get in between your relationships.", "Your sister loves and cares about you, and didn't want you to die (especially at her wedding). I bet she's the type of thoughtful that also packed comfy shoes for her bridesmaids just in case. \nYTA for not appreciating your sister taking care of you", "Sweetheart you're not an asshole. You want through a really hard thing and your family was in a position that they may have needed that Narcan back then, they love you and want you to grow old with them. Trust is a funny thing you can loose it quick as a wink but you need years to acquire it, I honestly expect this was just your sister loving and looking out for you and because you didn't need it you got a big scoop of trust back. 6 months of opioid independence is fantastic and 2 years will be even better and in 5 you will laugh about this, please be patient and know I'm proud of you and I bet they are too but the full trust will require more time. You will get there. \n\nP.S. I'm a paramedic student in NYC, my dad's a retired NYC EMS paramedic and my brother and his partner are ER physicians and Narcan lives in my purse and glove box and we keep it taped to the medicine cabinet at home. They all carry it. It's a rough time and I want those I can help to get it.", "6 months may feel like a long time for OP. And for a recovering addict, it is a big deal. Every single day clean is a huge success and he should be proud of the strides he is making. However, for his family it\u2019s just enough to get their hopes up while still wondering if it\u2019s too good to be true. \n\nMy brother just relapsed and ODed 2 weeks ago after exactly 6 months clean. Honestly, we have lost track of how many times he has relapsed in the course of the last 15 yrs. We keep Narcan on hand in the house for the occasions he comes home. \n\nBut. We don\u2019t rub it in his face. It\u2019s not a judgement hanging over his head for *when* he ODs next. It\u2019s there for \u201cin case\u201d, like an epiPen is for someone with a severe allergy. \n\nNTA, OP. Your BIL is though. There was absolutely no need for him to bring it up and present it like that.", "Yta. What a great sister", "YTA. You of all people should know that after six months you are not addiction free.", "NTA. I completely understand how awful that made you feel. It was mean and inappropriate for BIL to tell you that. You're doing a great job staying sober.", "YTA I carry Narcan and none of my friends have a history with opioids. I would be a lot more conscientious about carrying it if someone close to me did have a history of substance use.\nThey should have kept their mouth shut but they brought something that could save your life", "I\u2019m gonna go NAH. Congratulations on 6 months! You\u2019re doing great on your journey. With that being said, it is ongoing. You have every right to be upset, you are valid. But I think they also had the best intentions. I don\u2019t think it was a dig at your resolve. I think they\u2019re just being prepared for everything and that is smart. All of you need to have a heart to heart, no one is in the wrong", "NAH - you have a right to your feelings. \n\nThey were ready to protect you if necessary which shows how much they love you.

You have no idea, nor appreciation of, the horror you put your family through when you were using. You\u2019ve only been clean 6 months- that\u2019s great, but your sobriety is in its infancy. It sounds like your sister loves you & wants you to live. You owe her an apology for ruining her wedding with your selfishness.", "NAH, except BIL. It makes sense for them to bring narcan and for you to be upset that you feel they don't trust you. BIL just should've kept his mouth shut.", "NTA.   You weren't thinking about your addiction, but BIL shoved it in your face.   You never needed to know that they were prepared.\n\nThat said, only BIL had bad intent.  Your family clearly loves you enough to prepare for any dangerous things at the party.   It  didn't all have to be for you!  Lots of people are addicted to drugs.\n\nDon't distance yourself from your sister because of dumbass asshole BIL.   She loves you enough to hide that backup plan.\n\n\nAND props to you cor not needing it!  Stay clean!", "THEY WANTED TO SAVE YOUR LIFE!! (If need be) it\u2019s a wedding they knew people would be partying and things could possibly get out of hand. The BIL was shitty for telling you in this way but that\u2019s how it went. You\u2019re not an asshole but your sister isn\u2019t either", "YTA, clearly your family was worried about you, especially being in a tempting environment. They had it in case of emergency, and honestly, shouldn't you be happy they had it and didn't need it, instead of needing it and not having it?", "Yta", "YTA.\n\nYou are awesome for your sobriety, but your family just wanted to be prepared in the event that sheer willpower wasn\u2019t enough to beat an addiction that isn\u2019t easy to beat. Granted, you\u2019ve gone 6months, and while that isn\u2019t nothing, it\u2019s also not long enough for them to know it\u2019s long-term yet. You can\u2019t get mad at them for wanting to make sure you would be safe just in the worst case scenario.", "ESH\n\nBIL shouldn\u2019t have told you they had Narcan, but they are 100% right to keep it around when it could save the life of someone they love dearly (you). He\u2019s an asshole for mentioning your addiction at a wedding.\n\nYou are an asshole for thinking you get \u201ctrust\u201dafter 6 months, and for thinking them having Narcan means they don\u2019t trust you rather than it meaning *they don\u2019t want you to die*. Also, 6 months is not very long in the scheme of things, and they are right to keep an eye out for your safety when you haven\u2019t been sober for very long.", "YTA.  SIX months?  You think one & all should forgive and forget after SIX months?  YTA and you\u2019re naive.", "You're not fully an asshole but you're definitely not in the right in this situation...\n\nYou've been clean for 6 months, but how long were you in active addiction? And consider what went on while you were an addict, from their perspective as well?  6 months may seem like forever (and I'm not minimizing that for you, keep it up youre doing amazing!!) but in the span of an addiction, it's not. They have a right to be weary and over-cautious, especially on a stressful day that could potentially trigger you to drink and then snowball into other things (**im making the asumption that youre not drinking as well, solely based on my personal experiences with others).People can relapse after being sober for years and I'm sure it was just something they had on hand to ease one facet of the wedding that was causing them anxiety. As a family member of someone in recovery I will tell you that it has taken me years to not brace myself for the worst with every  phone call. And that's not the addict's fault, per se, it's just a coping mechanism for many of us. Prepare yourself for the worst so that you're not caught off guard.", "Absolutely YTA.  It's great that you're clean but I'm guessing that you've got a long history of not being clean if they thought they might need it.  Them having it demonstrates (a) they want you to survive any stupid mistakes you make and (b) they appreciate how hard recovery can be.  It is ridiculous to be offended by that.  How does it possibly hurt you?  You have to earn trust back when you've hurt or scared people. And this is so low level - it's not like they've refused to invite you because they're worried you'll make a scene, or refused to have you in their home because they're worried you'll steal stuff. That is a trust issue and I can't comment on whether they'd be reasonable trust issues.  But FFS having medication to save your life on hand and you're upset?  That's completely unreasonable.", "YTA. People relapse all the time. You yourself have probably already relapsed many times. That is the nature of getting off drugs.", "I don't wear my seatbelt because I distrust the driver, I don't because it's low cost and could be the difference between scary and completely devastating. Your BIL should not have said that, but after having friends OD I try to have narcan handy at events even tho I'm 99% sure I won't have to use it.\n\n Yta.\n\nThat said, congrats on your sobriety!", "YTA and your sister is a wonderful person for realizing that 6 months of sobriety and possibly having your first big event in that time is risky. 6 months of sobriety is nothing. Look around at the people in your meetings they have YEARS. The relapse rate around 6 months is really high. I would be happy someone cared enough about me.\n\nAlso she doesn\u2019t want you OD\u2019ing and dying in her special day. Would ruin the mood.", "I'm sorry, sweetie \u2764\ufe0f soft YTA. It is FABULOUS that you are clean for 6 months!!!! Buried a good guy 2 years ago who wasn't. Adore him still. \n\nFrom what I've seen, a lot of people who go into rehab and get clean are eyeing that New Start once they clean up. They're ready for the next chapter. Thing is, the previous chapters have already been written and read by the people who love them. Those chapters aren't erased, you just have more opportunities to create MUCH better endings for your book. Addiction does not hurt only the addict. It hurts everyone around them. Causes trauma to everyone nearby. Trust takes lots of time to build, only moments to destroy. It's not a magical \"you can trust me now\" wand. \n\nI totally understand why you feel frustrated and upset. It's perfectly reasonable. I get it. And I'm sorry. It is unreasonable to expect people to just magically trust you at the flip of a switch or even 6 months down the road. The trust will build with time, though. I promise \u2764\ufe0f Hey, they love you enough to plan ahead and have it ready for the worst case scenario. That's not a bad thing.", "Big, huge YTA. God forbid your sister cares and is prepared. She probably has it on her in every situation she\u2019s around you.", "ESH.  \n\nIdk, it is odd to think you would OD at the wedding.  BIL sucks for not keeping his mouth shut.\n\nThat said, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever trust an addict with 6 months.  6 months is fucking amazing for you, but it\u2019s not that much time at all to those of us who have been fucked over by addicts.  Especially off of opiates.  \n\nAnyways, don\u2019t let it get to you and congrats on being clean!!", ">I told her that if she didn\u2019t trust me then I would just leave\n\nYou're the one who's given her reasons to not trust you.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\n6 months clean while impressive on your part is still nowhere near the amount of time that it takes the loved ones of an addict to deal with the trauma and pain that loving an addict causes. You caused that. Then on top of the pain you already caused you turned a day that should have been an incredibly happy occasion for your sister into being all about you. Leaves me wondering how often you have done that to her in the past while you were in active addiction.", "So do you think they brought the Narcan in case you happened to relapse and ruin the image of their perfect wedding, or do you think your sister loves you so much she wants you to be alive...", "You know what? I think them bringing Narcan was an incredibly loving act. It means they recognized how incredibly challenging it is to stop using opioids, they recognized there is a not insignificant chance that you could have relapsed, and they wanted you there anyway. And, perhaps most important, they wanted you safe. Because they love you. \n\nI can understand why it feels like a vote of no confidence, but they were coming from a place of deep love. \n\nAlso, relapse IS incredibly common. I hope it never happens to you. But if it does, I hope you don\u2019t bear yourself up. \n\nNAH", "YTA\n\nIn my opinion everyone should have narcan in their daily life\u2019s with the amount of overdoses that are happening currently you would literally be saving someone\u2019s life\u2019s", "I\u2019m going to say ESH here because your BIL is a total AH for saying that to you the way he did, but as an addict myself, nobody trusted me and my sobriety for a good couple of years. I stayed clean once for 18 months and still relapsed. It happens. Better safe than sorry especially at something triggering like a party or wedding. While you shouldn\u2019t feel entitled to their trust with 6 months (but also congrats on 6 months! Everyday is hard) your BIL should definitely apologize for joking about something so crappy. Your poor sister is married to an idiot.", "About 2 years ago, my stepsister was crying to me on the phone because she was frustrated that nobody believed she was going to stay clean. Said she\u2019d been clean for months and everyone was still cautious about trusting her. I asked how many times in the past had she claimed to be sober & wasn\u2019t? It would take time, so give her loved ones a break. Two days later, she passed from an OD. Based on the evidence, she had relapsed months before, if she\u2019d been sober at all. She was really good at hiding it- until she wasn\u2019t. OP, it\u2019s been months, not years. Be glad they cared enough to think of bringing Narcan, just in case the environment/situation proved too much for you. Apologize and keep at it! Addiction is a seductive beast. It also affects everyone, not just the addict. \nHate to say, but YTA.", "NTA, I\u2019m getting narcan soon just in case, and six months or even six years is not long. relapse happens in recovery often and they wanted to be prepared for the in case scenario", "YTA. If you have a family member with an addiction problem you spend your life loving and worrying about the relative while hating the addiction and what it makes the addict do. Congratulations on six months clean and sober. Your family loves you enough to go out of their way to have you attend the wedding. They ran the real risk of you relapsing before the ceremony so they tried to plan for it. I am very sorry you got your feelings hurt but the addiction monkey is sometimes stronger than we know.", "YTA you traumatized your family by being an addict and you don\u2019t get to force them to trust you again or heal on your time.  Also it\u2019s a good idea for essentially everyone to have and know how to use narcan these days with the prevalence of essentially any and every street drug potentially being laced with fentanyl", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry that your family hurt your feelings, and that you want them to trust you. This will come in time. But ultimately, having narcan *is* supporting you because they want to keep you safe, just in case. Storming out of your sister\u2019s once-in-a-lifetime event was an overreaction and might have ruined her night, all because you didn\u2019t like their plan B.", "First of all - congratulations! It\u2019s a very difficult road, and although you have no clue who I am I\u2019m proud of you. It\u2019s a difficult road to recovery. But I think you do need to keep in mind the impacts of those around you. \n\nSix months is huge and wonderful. Six months feels like a long time and a short time all in one, you know?  Your loved ones aren\u2019t going to forget that you\u2019ve been brought back by Narcan. Your loved ones aren\u2019t going to forget all the fear, terror, and outright pure hell they went through alongside you. I can understand why they brought it - the reassurance just in case something happened. Because even though you\u2019ve been clean, that fear and anxiety isn\u2019t going to vanish quickly. \n\nThat said, I don\u2019t like the way your BIL went about it. But I don\u2019t quite feel right calling him an AH. NAH, I guess, with the note that BIL could have been way more tactful?", "Yta I\u2019ve been almost a year and a half clean and I still have Narcan in my house. I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re in recovery and you\u2019re doing better but they\u2019ve been with you through your addiction so you need to understand that they need to see you for who you are now, and have patience with them.", "YTA\n\nI've been addicted to opiates for 22 years and watched people die right in front of me before narcan was readily available. I've been \"clean\" 3 years but have relapsed multiple times in the past so I don't consider myself no longer an addict.\n\nIt's never an insult to carry Narcan, and you as an ex user should be carrying it out of knowledge of it alone.", "You were a being a bit of an AH.  I don\u2019t think you should have left, and I understand that you were upset that they didn\u2019t trust you, but you are only six months clean, and they were being cautious. Now, your BIL definitely was more of an AH.  He should not have said anything to you, and your sister would\u2019ve been wiser to keep it to herself or to ask another family member to have it on hand just in case.  These days, it\u2019s probably smart for someone in our large group to have Narcan on hand because you just never know with people. So you and your sister need to just talk it out, and you keep doing everything you can to stay clean and to stay healthy.", "YTA its not unreasonable for them to worry about you slipping up at a literal event where everyone around you is getting plastered. Your 6 months mean nothing, people go years sober and relapse so why would 6 months be any better. They love you and don't want to lose you. Be thankful for that and apologize for being a bummer on what's supposed to be the happiest night of her life.", "honestly NTA if you just left after saying that. its your choice you probably felt like a burden to your own sister which is awful.  \n\n\nHowever I think she was NTA too. She clearly cares about you and the only reason to bring that was out of love and concern. six months clean is great but all it takes is one wrong step and you're in the hospital.  \n\n\nthis situation wouldnt have happened had you been informed before hand, sure it might of hurt still but at least then she could explain it herself under better circumstances.  \n\n\nBut what you need to realize here is that there is no reason not to bring something that could save your life. They care about you. They wanted to keep you safe without being overbearing.", "Nah, you're not an asshole.  You had some big and overwhelming feelings and had to go, that's okay.  \nBut they are not assholes either for loving you so much they were prepared to save your life *if necessary*.  It's not about a lack of trust.  It's about being there for you.  BIL even said he was so happy it didn't happen.  People in your life love you and want you in their world.", "NAH\nI carry it wherever I go. I even have a sticker on my car that says I have it in case someone needs it and I\u2019m not around. Having Narcan is purely about love. Hoping you don\u2019t need it but knowing people struggle. If they didn\u2019t care, they wouldn\u2019t have it. If they didn\u2019t trust you, you wouldn\u2019t have even been there. Be proud of yourself right now for how far you\u2019ve come, and be proud to be part of a loving family. Keep up the good work. \u2764\ufe0f", "I\u2019m going against the grain and saying NTA. \n\nPersonally I know many addicts, and I\u2019ve lost a lot of family members to drugs. Yes addiction is selfish towards your family in the sense that it hurts them, but most addicts are deeply hurting individuals that are hurting others unintentionally because of their self destructive actions. It\u2019s not like most addicts want to hurt the people they love so I don\u2019t understand all the comments blaming you for something you probably already feel guilty for. \n\nThey weren\u2019t TAs for having it, but your BIL is most certainly the assholes for SHOWING it to you, during a time that is supposed to be fun and celebratory. That and the fact that you are clean presently, and obviously weren\u2019t doing opiates at the wedding makes your anger justified in my mind. I could never imagine telling a recovering addict I know something like that at a wedding. Even if you had good intentions by having it, what a quick and cruel way to make someone feel guilty/ shameful and hurt for something they are trying to overcome.", "YTA but I dont think it was malicious.  Congrats on being clean for 6 months! I can tell you as the sister of someone who was addicted to opiates, it's always in the back of your mind.  My sister has been clean for over 2 years now but I still worry about her all of the time. My worst nightmare is her overdosing in front of me and not being able to help her.  I think your sister's heart was in the right place, she was just looking out for you, but your BIL was the real AH for having no tact.  I can understand your feeling like she doesn't trust you, but you have to understand that addiction is a disease and relapses happen. I hid my pain pills after a recent surgery and my sister noticed that I didn't have anything for pain sitting out with my other meds and I think it hurt her feelings, but I told her it wasn't that I don't trust her, I just don't want to be the reason she would have a slip.  Try not to be too hard on her, she was trying to look out for you.  Congratulations again on your sobriety,  you should be so proud of yourself!", "Bro, you\u2019re a recovering addict. You want people to give you a chance but you\u2019ve got to realize you\u2019ve got give them a chance to stumble too. Your sister is so scared you might die from drugs that she thought to bring Narcan to her own wedding. She LOVES you. \n\nYTA", "Unfortunately I have to say YTA. Hindsight doesn't show how much your sister went through and honestly she was scared. She trusts you to a certain extent only because she's afraid of something happening. I would have felt hurt but look at jt this way she loved you enough to make sure you would have been safe. Have a heart to heart with her apologies and start fresh you are doing amazing and with her faith in you you will go far. Keep on that path.", "You're only 6 months clean, that's huge for you but not long in the grand scheme of things, and they were just being cautious. They didn't disinvite you and gave you a pretty major role in the wedding so I'd say they trust you but wanted you to be safe if the stress triggered a relapse. I think you're overreacting on a sensitive subject, which is understandable but unjustified. YTA", "Addiction (to anything) is a big problem and, as you doubtless know, it does not go away just because you have been clean for a given period. It is very common for people to get clean for a while then relapse. This is why things like Narcan exist. It\u2019s not a trust issue, it\u2019s a being prepared for the possibilities issue. \n\nThey were not AHs for having Narcan to hand. BIL was an AH for bringing up your addiction even though he thought he was being nice (\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing better\u201d would\u2019ve been more appropriate but still best avoided), and you were TA for your overreaction to an entirely sensible precaution.", "Soft YTA because I agree with the folks who have mentioned it is clearly out of love, but it shouldn\u2019t have been brought up to you. \n\nAddiction is hard for everyone, and so is having empathy for people who have to deal with it on a personal level. Being prepared for ANYONE to need narcan is a respectable thing, period, and I wish more people were willing to be trained and keep it on hand. I think the best thing for you to do is talk to them about why you are upset. \n\nAll that said? Fucking congrats on six months, and here is to many more! \ud83d\udc99", "Very very soft yes, here. BIL should not have told you what they brought, and certainly not in this way, but for them to have it shows their care and concern for you.", "I\u2019m proud of you! Six months is a big deal.\n\nI am going with YTA here, but I think it\u2019s because new you doesn\u2019t understand that old you is still your shadow. Six months is a long time for sobriety. But six months is a drop in the bucket for those who had to deal with it for all those years. Ask yourself. How many times did you let them down? Lie? Steal? Relapse? Hurt them? Be honest. Now add a few to it, because you may not have always remembered every instance, or more likely, justified it into disappearing from your conscience.\n\nIt will take more than a minute for them to trust you. Be patient, and keep giving them reasons to.", "I\u2019d say you\u2019re still wrestling with the control thing. Let that shit go. The less you let actions of others bother you, the more you realize how clean your sidewalk is. \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f", "I don\u2019t want to call you an asshole, but they\u2019re not either.  It\u2019s amazing you\u2019ve been sober!  But I can also understand why they\u2019d have Narcan on hand just in case.  If anything, they\u2019re expressing that they care about you and want to be prepared if something were to happen, but I can understand how upsetting it is to hear that.  BIL shouldn\u2019t have said that, and really shouldn\u2019t have put it in those terms, so if anyone is TA, he is.", "YTA. They brought it because they care about you. And as someone who has close family that was a heroin addict but got clean (for years now!), at 6 months you are still worried and can never know if they are lying about using to you.", "NTA. But your sister isn\u2019t either, she loves you. Your BIL, however, is a raging AH.", "It's really amazing that you're in recovery and it's been 6 months. \nCongrats to your new BIL on getting married. \nI'm not going yo say either of you is an A but you do both owe the bride an apology.", "YTA.they don\u2019t trust you? More like they love you enough to have it.", "I wouldn't go so far as to say YTA, but please understand that not everyone recovers in six months. For many, many people, it takes longer than that, and not everyone can be trusted at that point. Your family just wanted to make sure you were protected in case something went terribly wrong. For them to get the Narcan they probably also got trained in how to use it, and I think it's great that they took the time and effort to make sure that you would be safe. Try to see it from their perspective.", "YTA. I have zero tolerance for junkies .", "I\u2019m leaning NAH. With a slight nod to drunk BIL being a bit of an AH  He should\u2019ve kept his mouth shut. As long as you didn\u2019t make a big scene out of it, I understand leaving. Your fun was ruined.", "Yta. Better safe than sorry. Could he have kept his mouth shut? Sure. But the reality is, as addicts, it takes us a long time to earn trust back. 6 months is great, and you are awesome for getting that! But I'm guessing it's a drop in the bucket compared to how long you were using. \nLook at it from another perspective. At least they care enough to make sure they could help if something went wrong, and they didn't let that fear prevent them from including you in one of the most important days of their lives. You are lucky, not everyone gets the chance to be there for that.", "Unfortunately, you teach people how to treat you. It hasn't been long enough for them not to have concerns", "YTA\n\n6 months is an achievement for you, but for everyone else it\u2019s minutes. Your sobriety is very new and fragile, and you are lucky you still have people who love you enough to want you to be a part of their huge life event knowing that relapse is often part of the recovery process and having a plan in place if they needed to accommodate you relapsing. It\u2019s amazing that you didn\u2019t, well done, but don\u2019t be mad your relatives had to plan for all eventualities. You caused that, not them.", "I'm conflicted by this. I've had close family substance abuse their entire lives, and it's not easy being around them. I can see why your family may have trust issues that you're \"really clean\", but I also think you're completely justified in feeling hurt when you're in fact clean.\n\nRealistically you need to accept that it's going to take time for your family to fully trust that you're clean. Your BIL should've brought Narcan and kept his damn mouth shut if he didn't need it. Idk if I should go with N A H or E S H. Eh, ESH except for your sister.", "You're kind of a super soft YTA.  Congrats on 6 months sober.  That is amazing and you should be proud.  That said, six months is not enough time for the people around you to fully trust your sobriety/decisions, nor should it be.  Super soft YTA for you, normal YTA for your BIL. He should have known better than to tell you.  He could have just said \"well done\" and pulled out the story years from now when hearing it would have made you kind of proud.  \n\nGetting sober is hard.  Dealing with people dealing with user you, really seeing it, and them not fully comfortable that maybe you\u2019re not user you but sober you?  That takes time.  Just keep doing what you\u2019re doing, eventually, they\u2019ll see.", "YTA. Did you even let them explain why they had it? Did they tell you it was for you, specifically?

First off, and most importantly, well done on your 6 months clean. They were honestly looking out for you. It was crappy of them to make an assumption like that but in the end it\u2019s your well-being and the well-being of maybe even others at their wedding that they thought about in advance. The comment made by BIL was very AH in nature though. On a side note, I carry Narcan in my vehicles incase I ever encounter someone who needs it.", "I wish this was first. The only AH is the brother in law. What a horrible, horrible thing to do.\n\nAs an addict, it\u2019s really difficult for me to manage the part where I know that people are monitoring me. I feel like any move I make is judged or scrutinized. I can\u2019t just be. And I feel like I\u2019m just the person everyone sees as having to babysit and watch over instead of being their friend (this is when I\u2019m not drinking). All this is just a side effect of drug/alcohol abuse. I don\u2019t think anyone is wrong for being this way with me. It\u2019s just hard for me to be my (sober) self when I think I being monitored. And I don\u2019t want to be a burden on someone else\u2019s good time.\n\nIf I went months, feeling like people have stopped being so vigilant with monitoring me and i was getting a sense that people were starting to trust me as much as I trust myself and then something like what happened to OP happened, I\u2019d be humiliated and I\u2019d spiral. Thinking rationally, I would completely understand why they did it, but it\u2019s just something I didn\u2019t need to know. That why I say OP is not an AH. I know that if I were in the same situation, I\u2019d be inconsolable, because I knew this was something I caused myself and spiral over the realization that this trust may never be rebuilt. Things may never be the same and it\u2019s all my fault.\n\nOP\u2019s sister was being proactive and precautious. 6months isn\u2019t very long and if something did happen, addicts often overdose after being clean for a while. Having Narcan available at this stage of recovery was a good move. She did it only because she loves OP. I can\u2019t find a way to spin this into her only doing it for herself or to make her wedding go smoothly. It\u2019s Narcan, if the Narcan\u2019s coming out, the wedding will already have been cut short. She knew OP would be around gateways or temptations and was just looking out for him. If there\u2019s a more sinister interpretation someone could give me, I\u2019d be curious to know it. Anyway, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an AH whatsoever.\n\nCould OP\u2019s BIL know the nuanced and delicate psyche of a recovering addict\u2019s re-assimilation with their friends and family? No, but it was a callous comment about a very serious topic and he should have known better. He\u2019s TA.", "This.  The only AH is the brother in law.\n\nOP, please consider the content of this comment.  Your family was worried for you and wanted to make sure this was the first of many more wonderful memories with you.  If they didn't trust you, you would not have been invited.", "After looking up what narcan is, I agree. I think it's great that the sister brought that eventhough she's clean. She's just looking after her.", "This 110%. I bring Narcan with me everywhere I go just in case someone needs it.", "I think you make a great point - this isn\u2019t a trust issue. Loving an addict is traumatizing. \n\nI think their decision to bring Narcan was rooted in love, and influenced by trauma and experience. NAH. But BIL could\u2019ve definitely kept it to himself.", "Yeah, I think I'd go with this. Brother in law is an enormous asshole for bringing it up and basically going 'lols we totally thought that you'd fuck up' in OP's face.", "It wasn't until I was 10 years clean that my mom admitted she had a savings account set aside for if I had to go to rehab again.  She told me at this point because I had a big expense coming up and she said she finally felt comfortable dissolving that account and putting it towards this other medical cost for me.\n\nBecoming a different person, and being seen as that changed person are two separate things.  As an addict, we are lucky enough to not have crystal clear memories of what we did in our addiction - unfortunately, those close to us remember everything.  It will take longer for them to forget and to trust. \n\nThey shouldn't have told you about the narcan, but their intent was good - weddings can be really emotional for all involved, and they had a safety net for you in case you were triggered.  Seems it was done out of love.", "My brother nearly died on my birthday last year. \n\nI\u2019ve carried Narcan & Fentanyl test strips ever since.

But people have weird coping mechanisms, especially when they\u2019re worried about somebody they care about.", "It\u2019s actually kind of awesome that they were prepared to help him out if he had an unplanned medical emergency - kind of like bringing an epipen for someone even though you know they don\u2019t INTEND to eat a peanut and can generally be trusted not to unless something has gone very wrong! BIL shouldn\u2019t have mentioned it, which perhaps can be put down to drunk idiocy.

My sister was clean for 4 years and stole a bunch of my medicine a couple of months ago. I completely see why his sister brought Narcan. OP also needs to realize that gaining the trust of the people in his life is going to take time. A lot longer than 6 months.", "It\u2019s possible that hits not just about you.  People get to get fucked up at weddings. For many, it\u2019s just alcohol but sometimes people mix alcohol and pain meds.

I keep a fire extinguisher in my kitchen, i don't expect anyone to set my kitchen on fire (i hope it never happens), but if they do, I'm glad I have it.\n\nYou are still in really early recovery, and you are still working on building trust, and that happens by showing up sober and making amends (direct and indirect).\n\nShe clearly loves you she wants you to be around. And also she didn't know if anything at that wedding could trigger it, I have been to weddings where people are doing drugs in the bathroom and people getting drunk. It's like insurance on a car, you never want to get in an accident, but you are glad you have the insurance if you do.", "I agree, it would have been a good conversation to have, but it wasn\u2019t an insult so don\u2019t act like it\u2019s one.", "I've got to ask.\n\nWhat would you have said if she had told you before the wedding?\n\nAs much as I sympathize with how you feel, from what I gathered, you've been doing bad for many years and \"came up clean\" less than a year ago. Good on you, but I'd like to tell you that trust may take some more time to be rebuilt. \n\nIt's not clear how BIL brought it up in conversation. You're upset and it's understandable and you're okay to feel that way. But I can't see any malice there, just a sister being prepared if anything like that could happen. \n\nYTA but simply because you jumped right into the worst intents possible.", "??? What was she supposed to discuss with you about? \u201cHey bro just so you know we\u2019ll have narcan in case you wanna overdose again!\u201d ?? No?

She probably does trust you, but I don\u2019t doubt that she\u2019s still terrified of losing you. Your BIL shouldn\u2019t have said anything, and I don\u2019t blame you for being upset and removing yourself from the situation, but I also don\u2019t think your sister did anything wrong. Instead of convincing yourself that your sister doesn\u2019t trust you, consider the complex emotions associated with witnessing a loved one\u2019s suffering, and almost losing them entirely, and knowing that one small item could be the thing that saves them *if* they were to relapse.", "You are NTA for leaving.

Congratulations on your 6 months of sobriety! That\u2019s a massive accomplishment.\n\nI think your history of addiction (the length and the fact you\u2019ve overdosed before), is critical to add context to your post. Your BIL sucks for mentioning they had narcan, but your sister and family love you dearly and would do anything to keep you here with them. \n\nI can see how upsetting it must be to feel like they don\u2019t trust you. You\u2019ve worked extremely hard to get where you are now, and you might feel like your family can\u2019t see it (your evidence- the narcan.)\n\nI think your sister does trust you - you walked her down the aisle and you were with her for such a big life event. I\u2019m certain they\u2019re all so proud of you. While they might not truly understand your experience with addition, at some significant level they can see how hard you\u2019ve worked on staying clean. \n\nIt\u2019s safer, considering how early on you are in your sobriety to have narcan available just in case. As you may know, the risk of overdose is  extremely high if someone relapses after having been clean for a while. They love you. We all want you here. It\u2019s a precaution for any what-if. Your sister and your family almost lost you, twice. I think it\u2019s peace of mind to have the narcan as opposed to a judgement on your ability to stay clean. \n\nI have zero judgements about addiction, and I really believe in harm reduction. We had narcan in my house for years for my dad, just in case. \n\nKeep up your hard work on staying clean. I believe in you!!", "It\u2019s in the post, the new BIL said they specifically brought it for him.", "The BIL is also an AH without a doubt, but the OP isn\u2019t complaining about how she found out about the narcan. She\u2019s upset about the fact that they even had it there in the first place and didn\u2019t \u201ctrust\u201d her. Then she proceeds to make a scene at the wedding. That\u2019s what makes this a YTA situation. I don\u2019t know what this family\u2019s addiction journey has been, but many have a lot of false starts and relapses. So skepticism during early recovery is to be expected as the trust needs to re-earned. The OP is acting as if the trust should be instantaneous. Don\u2019t get me wrong, 6mos sober is an amazing start to her recovery. But she is also going to need to cut her family some slack as they adjust to the newly sober version of her. This is especially true if her recovery journey has included periods of sobriety followed by relapse.", "Ah, then YTA. \n\nAgree, it's absolutely relevant.", "And ruining his sisters night!!", "Congratulations on your ten years!!", "At only 6 months out OP probably isn\u2019t even close to understanding the reasons, unless they\u2019re very surface. This is why he is upset. He doesn\u2019t understand and probably isn\u2019t yet capable of all the insight needed to understand. Because everything was swept aside for the addiction.\n\nSo there\u2019s more work to do. A lifetime worth. Some prior addicts never do get it, they stay in an arrested development state even if clean.\n\nEdit- hopefully doesn\u2019t sound like I disagree with you, I don\u2019t. I fully agree. Just hope OP has professional guidance of some sort to help them with insight since addicts are terrible at this with their narcissistic brains.", "It's not even a faith issue. It's trust. Once it's gone, it's not on the people you've hurt to freely give it back. Of course I have faith that you can do it. Doesn't mean I'm going to leave my debit card or prescriptions in the room with you.\n\nMy mother in law died on Christmas Day of OD 2 years ago, after 2 years sobriety. She had her own place for the first time in years and seemed to be doing really well. I had every bit of faith in her. \n\nBut she bought a Xanax off the wrong person and her grandchildren had to watch paramedics cart her out just a few hours after Santa Claus brought them new toys. I will never, ever forget the look on my niece's face (I think she was 6 at the time) when we got there. I won't go into detail but the  details left on the mattress were traumatic enough for me as an adult. \n\nA year before that, I'd actually posted on AITA from an Alt account because she wanted to live with me, and I was struggling with the decision to let an addict who'd already abused my trust multie times live with me and my kids. I hate feeling this way, but I am glad my own kids didn't have to experience this. \n\n2 years she was supposedly sober, and this guy is upset about 6 months.", "Definitely. You can't control other people's opinions of you -- it's not an achievable goal.  And I still have some resentments towards how long it took to stop being the scapegoat of the family.  \n\nI went through an awful divorce before my fam realized 'maybe she's not gonna relapse'.  That was the moment that pivoted their view of me and my sobriety.  And being a person separate from my addiction. \n\nNot saying it's like, good or admirable.  But I think it IS human nature. This sort of healing takes time, and is not a guarantee.  And for me, it happened long after I stopped trying to change their opinion of me and I had just found peace within myself.", "My pedantic self needs to interject. Actually you can only prove a negative. You can't prove all swans are white (there's no feasible way to sample all the swans in the world), but you only need to find one black swan to prove that not all swans are white.  \nThat's the difficulty here. Trusting that someone is sober is essentially having faith in them while knowing that in the past they've shown they can have an unhealthy relationship with whatever they're addicted to.\n\nEdit to make my point more clear: OP has, in the past, proven he isn't not ok to handle the substance they were addicted to without over using it. It'll now be a matter of OP showing that they can handle triggering situations without falling into addiction. Over time, the trust will build and the hypothesis of OP not suffering from addiction anymore will become a theory (long term unrefuted hypothesis).\n\nAlso adding: OP, you rock. \nKeep up the good work and with time your sister will relax on having narcan around. Congratulations for managing the wedding, even with the disappointment. You're on track. This stranger is proud of you.\n\nNAH in my opinion. OP, you are awesome for being sober for 6 months, but that's not long term sobriety. Your sister loves you. She just wanted to be prepared in a potentially triggering situation. Try not to see it as your sister not trusting you, but as her way of being ready to be there for you no matter what. Better safe than sorry.", "I keep a couple easily available. I live in a neighborhood with high opiate usage. My birth giver od'ed on fentanyl last year. She survived because she had Narcan available.", "I keep one in my car as part of my first aid kit. I don\u2019t use and as far as I know none of my irl friends do either, but I keep it in case of emergency, like I keep my CPR face shield and things like water and emergency blankets. It\u2019s something that I hopefully will never need but the cost of being without it when it *is* needed is far too great for me to risk", "I'm required to have one in my vehicle when I use it for work.", "You have to buy it? I hate that it\u2019s something that needs to be bought. Where I live you just ask at a pharmacy. They don\u2019t check ID, they don\u2019t ask questions, they hand you the kit and you walk out the door, no cost. The kit has a paper with links to training on proper use. \n\nI never thought about about the fact some places make you have to buy it. I have one in my bag always, ever since I walked out the front door of my building and the sidewalk was covered with needles and I realized I could have walked out and found someone in distress who needed help. I went to the pharmacy that day and got it.", "Apologies!", "Yeah. I\u2019m sure the six months feels like forever to OP and in a sense it is. And it\u2019s a huge accomplishment that he should be proud of. Six months is massive. But it\u2019s not long for his family. \n\nAnd you know, if they expected he would use he probably wouldn\u2019t have been invited.

We're proud that you got through it ok\" The way he said it was more like \"we expected you to relapse\"\n\nThey're not wrong for having it and for not trusting OP, but he reacted the way that he did because of how he was communicated with.", "Exactly!

So I went ahead and asked for the supply, and I now have 2 nasal sprays in the cabinet by my front door. If someone OD's on my doorstep, I will do my best to keep them from dying!", "Until this thread I didn't realize narcan was available over the counter.
