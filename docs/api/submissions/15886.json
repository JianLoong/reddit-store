Even if you believe so, installing a measuring tool on your dashboard would very likely show you don't.\n\nTry keeping the recommended distance on a highway and the only thing that will happen is that other drivers continously use the safety distance to switch into your lane.", "Sometimes that pain doesn't show up until the next day.", "Well, calling her dumb is a wrong move, buuuuut...\n\nShe reverse into another car in a parking lot, right ? Like, a parked car... \n\nIt this is the case, then she wouldn't be badly injured, as parking lots are very low speed, and you never gun it in reverse anyway, and hitting a parked car is, for a lack of better words, dumb haha", "So just got to total three cars and risk lives before can become a safe driver then \n\nGot it. /s", "Uhm....that doesn't speak for the quality of your driver's education - if you total cars because you are incapable of judging traffic situations you should still have a trainer next to you. (I have to assume this is what happened, since you said 'she totaled' as in she was the active cause of the accidents) \nI'm really glad we have a lot of required driving hours during all times of a day where I live \ud83d\ude30", "Yes but she is in denial about the issue. She thinks the accident when she was 18 can be excused as she was a new driver, accepts responsibility for the post, for the more recent rear ending says it could have happened to anyone as the driver in front of her rear ended the car in front of him too and the chain started because they stopped suddenly. For the current one she said the other driver was going to fast and she did not notice until he slammed on the brakes and heard the screech.", "In another comment, he says she was backing out of a spot when she hit someone speeding past her.\nShe didn\u2019t see them until they slammed on their brakes and their car screeched.", "What would you have done differently if the cars right in front of you slammed on the brakes and crashed into each other?\n\nCars have momentum. You can only stop them so fast.", "Tbh I think she does have a point about the accident when she was 18. It's not uncommon for new drivers to have minor accidents. Sounds like she does accept responsibility for some of the accidents, so she might be willing to problem solve.", "Sounds like she has a habit of following too close. Also people do speed in car parks and they may well have shot into her lane as she was reversing and they slammed on the brakes just as she closed the distance and hit them.", "Well, it may change things.\n\nI don't trust the narrator, nor his gf, as I don't know them. I see, depending on the truth, two options :\n- if the guy \"speeding past her\" was really not, if she forgot to look around before backing out..., and she's an unreliable narrator, then ESH : OP for saying she's dumb, when she's rather a danger to others than dumb\n- if it really wasn't her fault, then yeah, OP is TA big time."]}
