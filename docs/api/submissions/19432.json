She's dead set in her ways and always thinks she's right, no matter the feelings of anyone else. I was always her quote \"worst child\" because I was \"crazy\" (I was the only one in the house with mental illnesses) and both of my sisters could do no wrong in her eyes. We have our days but overall it's a decent relationship.\n\nIn October of last year, I got married to the love of my life (m27). Since before the wedding, my mom asked if I was gonna get my body in shape for the wedding (I'm a plus sized woman) and I told her no. I've always been self conscious about my weight but said that If my husband liked my body the way it is enough to propose to me, he should still love my body the way it is to marry me. I told her this. She let it go. \n\nFast forward to March of this year, I was diagnosed with lymphoma. I started treatment and I have had a noticeable amount of weight loss over the past couple of weeks. I haven't told anyone except for my husband and we agreed that it would be a private matter unless something happened. \n\nMy family came over to visit and have dinner with us for the first time in a while yesterday. As soon as my mom came in she noted my weight loss and asked if I was getting ready for my \"summer body\". I said no and left it at that. My husband quickly changed the subject. At the table midway into dinner, my older sister asked how im doing being a housewife (I quit my job in January) and if I'm bored yet. My mom blurted out \"well with her losing this weight I bet Devin can't keep his hands off her, can't be bored with a husband that keeps you busy, if you know what I mean.\" I was offended, but I said nothing. Devin said \"I don't care what she weighs, she's still as beautiful as ever to me,\" and grabbed my hand. My mom didn't let up, \"well you must want a partner that takes care of themselves, she's on the right track so far\" I'd had enough, I stood up and told everyone to get out. She looked appalled and put up a fight arguing with my husband that I shouldn't be so sensitive and it's not like she's calling me fat. I told her to never come back and that I'm done with her. \n\nMy husband thinks that we should sit down and talk to her about what she said and come to some sort of resolution but I don't want to because I know the conversation isn't gonna go anywhere. I've been getting texts from my family saying \"that's just how she is\" and \"at least talk to her\" and \"you only get one mother\" and ones from my mom saying \"you're being petty\" and \"is not that serious\" but I'm completely over it. I'm the only one she's like that with. I may be being too sensitive over this, but I want to stand up for myself. I shouldn't have to tell her why I'm losing weight in order to justify anything.
