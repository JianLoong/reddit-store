Because no physician would tie my tubes.  \n\n\"What would my *future* husband think\"!\n\nif you  *DON'T*  want to get pregnant (especially in the US) a vasectomy and having your tubes tied is usually 100%  effective birth control (there have been exceptions).", "Yeah he totally sucks for being raped.", ">  I expect someone this crazy to end up with a restraining order during the next 18 years.\n\nWhich will still suck pretty hard for him. Being manipulated into becoming a single parent is pretty shitty.", ">Do they not teach that any more?\n\n\n\nI and everyone I know was taught that, and I don\u2019t know a single person that uses condoms in a serious relationship. It\u2019s definitely the safe and responsible thing to do, but I feel like most people don\u2019t use more than one type of birth control.", "In the US?  Very little.  In the MAGAts states, then there's even less.  Education in general, is being discouraged.", ">because most don\u2019t like how a condom feels.\n\nIt's absolutely buck wild to me that this is even a consideration. I came up in the kink scene during the AIDS crisis, when the ethos was very much \"use a condom every time so you don't die.\" The fact that the condom didn't feel quite as good as raw dogging it just wasn't a factor. It was drilled into my head from a very early age that you use condoms every single time until you are dead sure that you are in a monogamous long-term relationship.\n\nIf I encountered a partner who didn't want to use condoms, I sent them straight to the curb.", "Yeah it\u2019s pretty crazy. And I\u2019m only 28 so we\u2019ll belong the AIDS crisis. I remember me and one of friends getting clowned one day because we pulled out along with having a condom on."]}
