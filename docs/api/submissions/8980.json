The baby won\u2019t have married parents. HUGE difference.\n\nRelationships are based on trust and love. The way I read this is that the ex fianc\u00e9 just wasn\u2019t ready to get married after 5 months, totally reasonable, so the cousin started to intentionally skip her birth control knowing that would get a proposal. She lied about the BC not even giving him an option to use a condom instead. \n\nI surely wouldn\u2019t want to marry someone that would lie to me in such a huge way and would be grateful someone told me about it. \n\nThe family is mad at the wrong person.\n\nNTA OP, sadly no good deed goes unpunished though.", "How will the baby not have a father?

Your cousin played a stupid game and won a stupid prize so consider that you spared 'John' further future grief to come\n\nYour cousin deliberately skipping the birth control with intentions to baby trap a man is disgusting, wrong and alarming. It is both a form of sexual abuse and violation of another person's reproductive rights. What your cousin did is to take away his body autonomy his right to decide when he can be a father and when can he be a husband at his own timing. \n\nYou keep being the hero you are and warn all her future lovers so that she cannot do it again", "Yeah, it is like stealthing without the increased risk of STIs. I'd feel violated by either. \n\nI'm not trying to pass blame or anything. What the GF did here was awful. I'm just saying that, for me, I feel safer if I bring my own form of bc to the party, no matter what my partner says they're on.", "Actually it's the exact equivalent. Because someone entered a sexual situation with consent that was based under the pretense that protect is used (and in this case it was her saying she was on the pill) and she lied. She stealthed him just like a guy would've done. She claimed she took the birth control /used B.C and lied. Just like a guy would say but with a condom.\n\nI'm glad you told him because what she did IS SA. And he deserved to know. Tell him to lawyer up too, to get his ducks in a row cause he's in for a long as fuck 18yrs.", "It is. Stealthing and what your cousin did are both a form of sexual abuse. \n\nConsent to sex with contraception/protection =/= consent to sex without protection. Your cousin had sex with him on purpose without valid consent from him. Your cousin sexually abused that poor guy. You just revealed her abuse. NTA", "You're correct. My upbringing showed in a way I didn't want to communicate. As for the rest, agree.\n\nIf anything, I'm saying that his family won't take his side. As much as I don't think OP's the A, it's not my opinion he must deal with.", "But do you want to forever live like that?

Is that realistic?", "Yep, they most likely won\u2019t and that\u2019s so wrong but, OP did the right thing.", "I am married.\n\nWhen we decided we were done having kids, we traded the condoms in for a vasectomy. Problem solved.\n\nNo one can 100% rely on bc because no bc is 100% effective. When I was in school they taught us that two forms was more responsible than one and that men should wear condoms and women should use the pill/IUD/sponge at the same time. Do they not teach that any more?", "NTA. I went to high school with a girl who did this to her bf - he got an athletic scholarship to a college 3-4 hours away, so she went off BC without telling him and got pregnant to babytrap him. He broke up with her as soon as he found out (I think she may have confessed out of guilt), and she either miscarried or secretly had an abortion, which quite frankly was the best outcome for both of them.", "NTA NOBODY is entitled to keep a lie about protection from their sexual partner confidential. EVER. Moral particularism, people -- this secret HAD to be told to the victim!", "NTA. I would further advise that dude gets a paternity test before he signs the birth certificate. Your cousin is a liar and she made an important life decision without consent.", "NTA.  John deserved to know.  I don\u2019t think your cousin will ever forgive you, and that\u2019s okay.  Her actions have already shown that she is lacking in some of her thought processes/decision making skills.  I imagine your cousin is going to find out many, many, times over how poor a decision she made, regret it, and hopefully learn from it.  I hope John is in a position where her forcing fatherhood on him is not going to cause him undue hardship, and that he finds great joy in being a father to the child.", "You and your cousin are both AHs. \n\nYTA", "OP is absolutely NTA for sharing information about their cousin's private conversations, because honesty and transparency in relationships is important for trust and communication. If the cousin was joking about forgetting to take birth control and potentially getting pregnant in order to manipulate her partner into getting engaged, this could be seen as unethical and manipulative behavior. By bringing it to the partner's attention, OP helped to prevent a potentially unhealthy and unstable relationship from forming. The partner has the right to know about any information that may impact the future of their relationship, and the person writing the scenario was simply acting as an intermediary of information that was relevant to the situation.", "Baby trapping also doesn\u2019t work most of the time. A couple that I went to school with started dating in 12th grade. A couple of years after finishing high school the relationship started to get rocky and it looked like they\u2019d break up. So she decided to get pregnant because that would fix everything. She secretly stopped using birth control and got pregnant. As soon as he found out that she\u2019d done it deliberately, which was almost immediately, he broke up with her. As far as I know, he\u2019s still active in his daughters life.", "Maybe not. She only got pregnant to trap him. Since it didn't work, maybe she'll give up her parental rights so she can focus on searching for Prince Charming.", "Oh, no, no, no, no, you didn't! \"Men who believe their partner is on birth control and choose not to use a condom have no one to blame but themselves when she lies and gets pregnant\" is NOT how it works!", "You didn't explain why it was wrong to mention the joke.", "Question: Does \"stealthing\" only refer to tampering with the condom against your partner's will/without their knowledge or all methods of tampering with protection/lying about protection against your partner's will/without their knowledge? I'm going to use it as if it refers to all, and if there's a different term, and someone provides it, I will edit.\n\nMoral particularism -- when someone is the victim of stealthing, it is ABSOLUTELY your business to tell them, particularly before they marry their deceitful, selfish, uncaring partner.", "At least he isn't married to her, so the only money he's gonna be spending is on himself and his son.", "Ah, but is he sure about that? Maybe it's not his. Maybe she's not even pregnant, yet.", "yeah I wish stealthing bc was illegal the way stealthing a condom is.  its no different.  removal of the bc is removal of the consent.\n\ni also wish men would stop trusting women claiming they're on the pill and protect themselves.", "Sex to me is more than just dick into a vagina. Sure no condom feels better for the least important part of sex but the closeness, and emotions that go into the experience prior and throughout is what makes it amazing, with or without a condom. Maybe I'm weird though, I also don't like one night stands. If there's no emotional attachment I would rather have a threesome with lefty and righty.", "Sadly growing up in a red state (US), the only form of protection they taught us in school was abstinence\u2026"]}
