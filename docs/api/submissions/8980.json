That's awful!", "NTA what she did is coercive reproduction and is illegal in a lot of places", "NTA \nWhat she did should be considered criminal behavior. You cannot just coerce someone to impregnate you. To keep them around.

Only an idiot has sex without condoms, then pretends to be surprised when pregnancy happens.", "Ugh.

You don't trap people into that. Yuck nta", "NTA. Play stupid games. Win stupid prizes.", "Ish. \n\nWhat your cousin did is not ok.\n\nWhat this guy did is also not ok. You should go into relationships thinking about the future or be open about it being a casual or one time thing. His religion should not play more of a factor than him being emotionally responsible with your cousin.\n\nThat being said, it's not your relationship. Yes, you spoke the truth, and that's great.\n\nBut now you have to face the consequences of your family going against you. The fiance and his family will probably not defend you because they don't have a direct relationship with you.\n\nEverybody seemed content, but now the baby won't have a father. On the other hand, that might be better in the long run. Couples with no love can fuck up a child.", "ESH. \n\nYou are an AH for mentioning the \"joke\", I believe you knew that this would cause problems. \n\nYour cousin is the biggest AH for trying to trap a guy. She is now going to have to deal with being a single mum because of the choices she made. She clearly needs some professional help to deal with her fairy tales ideas.\n\n(Edited changed sister to cousin)", "ESH\nif he didn\u2019t want to have children, he should\u2019ve wrapped it up \n\nyou should not have betrayed her confidence \n\nshe should not have stopped taking her BC without telling him", "ESH it's really not your business, she shouldn't have done that.

He was willing to marry her and whatnot, because he was accepting that the BC must have failed, and he was like \"ok, well, our bad: and move forward.", "Who says the baby won\u2019t have a father? The baby won\u2019t have married parents. HUGE difference.\n\nRelationships are based on trust and love. The way I read this is that the ex fianc\u00e9 just wasn\u2019t ready to get married after 5 months, totally reasonable, so the cousin started to intentionally skip her birth control knowing that would get a proposal. She lied about the BC not even giving him an option to use a condom instead. \n\nI surely wouldn\u2019t want to marry someone that would lie to me in such a huge way and would be grateful someone told me about it. \n\nThe family is mad at the wrong person.\n\nNTA OP, sadly no good deed goes unpunished though.", "How will the baby not have a father? He\u2019s not abandoning the kid he just wants to be away from his ex. 2 happy homes is better than 1 miserable one", "Of course telling him that she lies to try to force him into marriage would cause problems. \n\nAlso. Cousin...", "Even if he wanted kids, it's a betrayal of trust that makes a relationship a bad idea. He can be a dad without being with her.", "OP, you done nothing wrong and you didn't do it on purpose by breaking up two people. You told him the truth and he had the right to know the truth. Your cousin played a stupid game and won a stupid prize so consider that you spared 'John' further future grief to come\n\nYour cousin deliberately skipping the birth control with intentions to baby trap a man is disgusting, wrong and alarming. It is both a form of sexual abuse and violation of another person's reproductive rights. What your cousin did is to take away his body autonomy his right to decide when he can be a father and when can he be a husband at his own timing. \n\nYou keep being the hero you are and warn all her future lovers so that she cannot do it again", "Yeah, it is like stealthing without the increased risk of STIs. I'd feel violated by either. \n\nI'm not trying to pass blame or anything. What the GF did here was awful. I'm just saying that, for me, I feel safer if I bring my own form of bc to the party, no matter what my partner says they're on.", "Actually it's the exact equivalent. Because someone entered a sexual situation with consent that was based under the pretense that protect is used (and in this case it was her saying she was on the pill) and she lied. She stealthed him just like a guy would've done. She claimed she took the birth control /used B.C and lied. Just like a guy would say but with a condom.\n\nI'm glad you told him because what she did IS SA. And he deserved to know. Tell him to lawyer up too, to get his ducks in a row cause he's in for a long as fuck 18yrs.", "It is. Stealthing and what your cousin did are both a form of sexual abuse. \n\nConsent to sex with contraception/protection =/= consent to sex without protection. Your cousin had sex with him on purpose without valid consent from him. Your cousin sexually abused that poor guy. You just revealed her abuse. NTA", "You're correct. My upbringing showed in a way I didn't want to communicate. As for the rest, agree.\n\nIf anything, I'm saying that his family won't take his side. As much as I don't think OP's the A, it's not my opinion he must deal with.", "But do you want to forever live like that? Like, of you are married, do you want to use a condom because you can't 100% rely on bc? Is that realistic?", "Yep, they most likely won\u2019t and that\u2019s so wrong but, OP did the right thing.", "I am married.\n\nWhen we decided we were done having kids, we traded the condoms in for a vasectomy. Problem solved.\n\nNo one can 100% rely on bc because no bc is 100% effective. When I was in school they taught us that two forms was more responsible than one and that men should wear condoms and women should use the pill/IUD/sponge at the same time. Do they not teach that any more?"]}
