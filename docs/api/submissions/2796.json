Shortly after we got married, he began gaining weight at a rapid pace. He\u2019s always been a big guy, but when we met he was around 220-30..

What used to be a maybe once a weekend habit is now a morning, lunch and all night long habit during the week, and on weekends, he just goes on pot benders if there is such a thing. The entire den of our house stinks and I hate to think of how much money he blows on pot.he got his medical card and it just makes things worse. \n\nHe smells horrible; his feet and his armpits and the smoke.  His feet make my eyes water. \n\nI pay over half of our mortgage, his insurance, all utilities, and he eats all of our food. He does pay for groceries but\u2026 he eats it all. \n\nI can\u2019t even sleep in our bed because he takes up all of the room and when he moves, the entire bed shifts. I\u2019m forced to sleep in our guest room on the tiny bed which hurts my back and he acts offended that I don\u2019t sleep in our room with him. \n\nI have told him, in tears, that I\u2019m scared of losing him and he doesn\u2019t act like his weight is an issue. He acts like doctors are jerks for MAKING the weight an issue. I\u2019ve called psychiatrists to make appointments and therapists; he went to 1 appointment each then quit. \n \n\nHis cpap machine has been leaking lately and he has been told he needs to go on a bipap machine. \n\nI\u2019m 40 years old and am resentful because I feel like I\u2019m living in a nursing home; he smells, he can\u2019t walk, he can\u2019t get out of his chairs,I  can\u2019t even sleep in my own bed, I\u2019m paying all of the bills, and I\u2019m worried about him but I feel like such a superficial jerk because I\u2019m falling out of love.

There's only so much you can do. At the end of the day, he's either going to get help and lose the weight or he's not. Unfortunately, there's really not much you can do to change that. I'm not going to suggest \"cutting your losses\" and moving on, but at some point you need to do what's best for you. The stress of all this could very well cause health problems for you. There's risk of stroke, heart attack, anxiety, and depression on your end due to all the worry and stress.... Really crap place to be in mentally.", "NTA \n\nYou married a person you loved and signed up for a certain way of life. He has taken that person and that life away from you.\n\nDoes he not have a sense of smell or a mirror?\n\nIf he won't acknowledge that he is being terribly unfair to you and take steps to change then he is saying that your happiness is not important to him.\n\nIs that a person who you want to spend the rest of your life with?", "NTA. Your husband needs help, but the painful truth is that no-one can help him if he isn't the one to reach out for help. You've tried to be supportive, and it's obvious you aren't breaking up with him because of his weight, but because of his indifference towards his own health. It's extremely painful to stand by and see someone who you (used to) love destroy themselves. You aren't a superficial selfish jerk for getting upset with him. Anyone would, eventually.\n\nIt might be best to take a break from each other or set firm boundaries.", "NTA.\n\nI recommend separate counseling for both of your and couples counseling together. If he refuses any of this, then you need you need to see a counselor (who also has experience with couples) to see if you should stay. After a ten years, things will not magically improve.\n\nDon't be guilted into thinking weight is the issue, its not. The issue is the continued lack of  concern about and failure to prioritize a partner's experience in a relationship.\n\nI know far too many people who have invested decades of their lives bending over backward for a spouse who doesn't accommodate them at all. These people are full of regret, some are angry and some are depressed; and its heartbreaking. Try everything you can in the coming year, but resolve to make a decision some time next year once you have exhausted all possibilities. I'm sorry, OP. Hang in there.", "NTA - I smoke pot morning, noon and night and it helped me lose 100lbs and become fit, it shouldn\u2019t be used as a reason to be lazy and shift accountability. Sounds like the groceries and food kept in the house needs to be changed up, and he needs to speak to a doctor/therapist because there are some deeper issues. That is a huge weight gain and you\u2019re NTA and not superficial for not being attracted to him, he\u2019s gained the mass of another adult male. He sounds as though he has \u201cgiven up\u201d so to speak and isn\u2019t in a rush to make any changes, so he either needs a helping hand or maybe it\u2019s time to move on. You deserve a marriage full of intimacy and passion which sounds impossible in his current state.

My husband is 29 and I noticed him getting into those patterns. He's 6ft 425lbs. Started taking more days off and never wanting to get out of bed. \n\nI started eating outside the house. He started ordering pizza and would complain when he didn't have the money. I told him he can figure it out or I'm moving out. \n\nHe's still stuck to the couch but he buys his own food, goes to work, and doesn't make it my problem.  \n\nI still sleep on the couch because we don't fit in the bed together. If he doesn't lose some weight, idk what I'll do.", "NTA. He sounds like his eating and his pot use might have risen to the level of addiction. If so, that's not something he can help but it's not something you should feel bound to facilitate either. Don't feel bad about being disgusted by him - that's not something you can control and nor should you have to. Addicts can't be saved by other people; they need to find the will themselves. \n\nThe most important thing to do for you is to up your own efforts at self-care. He won't get help, but that doesn't mean you can't. Can you find a therapist to support you? Can you get a better mattress for the bed you sleep on?", "NTA.\n\nYour spouse has a (several?) problems, and that is not your fault. You're not obliged to love and care for someone who is self-destructive and unwilling to get help. It sounds like you've gone above and beyond to help him and his lifestyle is severely impacting your own well being and finances.   \n\n\nIt's not gonna get better if he doesn't think there's a problem. You need to decide for yourself if you want to continue living the way things are or not, since he seems unwilling to change.", "NTA. OP I'm so sorry for what you're going through. I have a morbidly obese, overeating father and watched my mother spend her entire marriage fighting with him, crying, begging him to get healthy, to no avail. She too eventually became disgusted, and I don't blame her.\n\nI also have an alcoholic husband. Tbh I see the two things as very similar. My father clearly also has a strong addiction - to junk food. And just like with my husband, I know I can't make my father get help and get healthy. We've all tried. He has to want to.\n\nYour husband sounds depressed, and as a former pot smoker myself, this habit is not helping him. A lot of people can use pot in a really healthy way, but not everyone. I stopped because it made me stagnant, without motivation.\n\nBut you can't make him do anything. You've tried. It's now affecting your physical and mental health, and your daily and financial life. It's time to remember that really popular analogy floating around the internet - put your own oxygen mask on. Do what you need to do for yourself and your wellbeing.\n\nYour husband is an autonomous adult and you are not responsible for him, he is responsible for himself.\n\nMy father is now in his 70s, still morbidly obese, still eating huge amounts of junk food. He has had a stroke, and now has type 2 diabetes. He showers about once every 2 weeks. He has tantrums when his blood sugar spikes. We've all basically given up trying to talk to him about it.", "NTA and honestly, unless he actually reaches out and asks for help, he's going to do absolutely fuck all about his situation so you should now focus your priorities on your own health and your safety for that matter. \n\nYou've already mentioned that his condition is taking a toll on you mentally and how he gets offended if you don't sleep in the same bed as him. The thing is, with how heavy he is now, he could accidently roll over into you and crush you under his own weight of you sleep in the same bed as him!\n\nMy advice is to quietly get your ducks in a row and put plans in place to get yourself out of you need to but also have an honest discussion with your husband on the situation. Don't let him skirt the issue. Tell him that his condition is taking a toll on your health and he either takes responsibility for his condition and seeks help in losing weight and improves his condition or for your sake of your own health, you'll divorce him. He'll make up all the excuses under the sun to guilt you into staying but you need to stay the course and go if he refuses to seek help.", "Wow.  Similar post on here recently with an obese female as the SO.  OP was buried in y-t-a's.  Where are all the \"how dare yiy fat-shame this person\" commenters now??

It is worth your happiness, maybe by leaving him, it will be a wake up call for him.", "Definitely NTA. And you should set any boundaries you feel are what you need, including leaving.\n\nIf you do want to try one more thing, I would suggest trying to get him into an Overeater\u2019s Anonymous meeting. They are accessible all day long via Zoom. Hearing from people who have also struggled makes it hard to dismiss what they say as judgmental. If he can stick with it and get a sponsor, he might be able to claw his way out of this. Wishing you luck with whatever you decide.", "Nta. My guy almost doubled himself in the 3 years you\u2019ve been married?! What you\u2019re describing sounds really bad and borderline harmful to both of your health.

And you're pleading with him to get help, but there's nothing you can do to make him. You must be in flight or fight mode constantly!\n\n Please please please look into support groups or therapists specializing in addiction. There are resources that are helpful to YOUR health, you have to put yourself first. And you don't have to go through this alone! There are other people in your situation, there's strength in community! (ALAnon was so helpful for me) I wish I could give you a hug, OP!

As a man who at one point was 392 pounds, you need to leave this individual.  When you are stuck in this eating addiction, it's because you are not facing what is actually bothering you.  Your hiding behind all your weight, actively trying to push people away.  When your this heavy, the fat is like a suit of armour you hide behind.  Saddly it's very hard to come out of this mindset.  No one can help you, or force you, it's a personal choice that only your husband can make.  It is an addiction, and no amount of pleading, begging, crying, will make any difference, because he is lost in his own shit right now.  He is drowning and no one can save him but himself.  You don't need to divorce, but you should leave and go live your life.  Life is ment to be fun, and when you live with someone like this, it's only a nightmare.  I hope you can find a resolution that works for you, good luck.", "NTA.  Its time to think of yourself, because he has ceased to care about you or the marriage. You need to tell him you are falling out of love with him, that he is no longer the person you want to be with. That if he is not willing to take responsibility for changing the situation, and you don't see any change, then you will leave him.  If he says he wants to address the situation, give yourself a time frame for seeing change or getting out.", "NTA. Im sure this will get me a lot of crap but I would have to go! Get a small apartment for yourself, get your dream bed, and enjoy the pot-free and BO free air. If you are on the mortgage pay half so you don't have a foreclosure but take your name off the utilities, internet, etc. Maybe he will get a clue or maybe he won't but you have the right to live comfortably.", "I\u2019m in a downward spiral mentally. I\u2019m afraid of him lately and I can\u2019t even explain why.", "He won\u2019t really discuss it. He will tread lightly, saying he \u201cknows\u201d he has to lose weight but that\u2019s as far as he will go. He takes no action. We have had sex once this year. Once. I frankly have no desire despite being fairly young, fit, and we have no children. I have expressed to him multiple times that our void of a sex life just breaks my heart and he has told me he doesn\u2019t feel sexy but does nothing to fix it. The last time he simply said \u201cwe can just be intimate in other ways.\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t even have a desire anymore, given his body odor and that his clothes don\u2019t fit, and sadly, his size makes it difficult. I\u2019m crying as I write this because I feel like I\u2019m supposed to be here for him through everything but I don\u2019t even want to be anymore. I feel like an asshole, but I\u2019m also exhausted.", "Thank you. It\u2019s not a vanity issue of 20 pounds. He has in fact gained an entire person, he coughs chronically, he can\u2019t walk, his clothes don\u2019t fit, he can\u2019t sleep, he has body odor, and I am perpetually scared. He ignores my pleas, I get no help with household expenses, he has a straight up addiction to smoking lot, we do not have sex, and I feel afraid of him for reasons I cannot explain. I don\u2019t know what to do.", "I think you feel afraid of him because he's turned into someone you don't recognise anymore and you just cannot fathom why he'd hurt himself like this.", "You're not an AH at all.\n\n>I\u2019m crying as I write this because I feel like I\u2019m supposed to be here for him through everything but I don\u2019t even want to be anymore.\n\nI think you need to reframe this and think about whether *he's* here for *you*, and the short answer is that he isn't - at all. \n\nYour husband is being extremely selfish. From what you've said, he is totally dependent on you to maintain his unhealthy lifestyle but gives you nothing back in return. You've tried everything to get him to realise that he needs to make serious lifestyle changes and have made it clear that you're burning out trying to care for him. Nobody can be expected to have infinite patience for someone who seems hell-bent on spiralling into an early grave, especially since his behaviour is directly impacting your quality of life in a house that you mostly pay for.\n\nQuite honestly, if my husband became the person your husband is I wouldn't be able to deal with it forever, and I think you'd not be an AH for leaving yours over this.", "I understand the feeling that you are supposed to be there for him. After all, it is in the marriage vows. None of that invalidates your feelings. You can't make yourself attracted to things that repulse you.\n\nMy guess is that he is so depressed that he is not able to motivate himself. I have gone through that myself and I can attest that it is possible to be so stuck that you can know exactly what you need to do but quite literally cannot do it. He needs to discuss this with his doctor and may need medication before he will be able to take the steps he must.\n\nPlease do what you can to encourage him that  there is a solution. I found my solution.\n\nThat said there is nothing hateful about your feelings. You are not a bad person for having them. You can get your marriage back", "Yeah it sounds as though he\u2019s a different person with a different lifestyle completely and don\u2019t let anyone make you feel shallow. You\u2019re probably feeling afraid because you feel like you\u2019re almost living with a stranger. People can change, relationships have their rough patches and people grow apart but unless he\u2019s willing to make a change for himself he won\u2019t. Maybe speak to friends and family about an intervention as a way to help start the process but at the end of the day he has to be the one who is willing to put in the work.", "At this point go stay with a friend or family member for a weekend. Or go stay at a hotel over night. You need to think about this away from him, so your feae of him or for him isnt tainting your thought process. Tell your husband that you need time away to figure out if you are prepared to be in a loveless/sexless marriage for the rest of your time together. That you're willing to help him get healthy again as long as he ACTUALLY gets up to do it, but since he showing zero motivation, your considering separation/divorce. \n Do what's best for you. You're NTA for wanting to be with the person you fell in love with or leaving when that person \"does a 180\" and you don't even recognize them anymore.", "For me, I feel like the \"in sickness and in health\" part at least requires the person who is ill to at least be consenting to get treatment to try and either hold off of the illness or recover from it. Whether that's going to therapy sessions or taking anti-depressants for mental health issues, or taking medication to slow the progress of things like Parkinson's or Alzheimers, or discussing treatment options for cancer with an oncologist.\n\nEngaging with treatment options means that you want to try to get well again. You know that supporting you is hard on your partner, and you want to actively do your best to recover. Obviously that may be a managed decline with neurological conditions or some cancers. But you still need to be putting in effort so that the entire job of supporting you does not crush your other half.\n\nIt sounds like OPs husband feels he doesn't need to put this effort in, and she can't pour from an empty cup. If he's not willing to get the help needed to confront the problem then she needs to start focusing on herself instead. And if that means leaving him - well then do be it, she's done what she can."]}
