All she needs to do is put it there when she takes it off n", "ESH/YTA. I feel like banging both of your heads together. What an unnecessary conflict/drama, over something so small and easy to solve.\n\nShe's an asshole for leaving the collar in inconvenient places. But why complicate it for her (by explicitly having her get up and put the collar back on, the next day)? I don't know, that solution just feels like you're trying to 'educate' a naughty child, to teach them 'consequences'. It does feel patronising - like you're trying to 'punish' her for doing something you don't want her to do (taking the collar off, and unintentionally causing you delays). \n\nBut 'teaching lessons' isn't the way to go in partnerships. And I suspect the patronising tone of your 'solution' (and maybe the fact you were 'fuming'), rubbed her the wrong way - when she actually HAD been open to finding a solution. Often it's not the problem you have, that is unreasonable. It's how you put it across to the other person, that can wind them up. \n\nWhy the frig can't you both just agree that she hangs up the collar on a designated hook in the evening? You could even check yourself before going to bed (if you wanted to), that the collar was on the hook. And nobody has to get up any earlier, to sort out the dog's collar. \nThat way, everyone's happy - you are, because you know where the collar will be. She is, because she's not worrying the dog is uncomfortable. \n\nAnd btw, I find you a bit assholey for complaining 'she puts an idea of the dog's comfort over my need to save time in the mornings'. Dude, the dog's comfort IS important (yes, even over the owners' convenience at times). No matter how soft the collar, it will still be stiff to some extent. Why risk the doggy having any discomfort, when the owners SHOULD be able to resolve such a minor issue between them (hang it on a blinkin' hook, the night before) ?! Sheesh. First world problems.", "Nta if she removes the collar she takes the dog for his walk or cleans up the mess", "Have her designate a spot for the collar, if she fails to keep putting it where it belongs tell her to kindly f off and stop taking it off. Your dog needs It and can't go anywhere without it", "She's being unreasonable and incredibly rude. \nNTA.\nI see how she might forget in the mornings. \n\nJust get a hook. Same spot everytime.", "i love that!! my childhood dogs had their \u201cpretties\u201d, and so help us if we dare try to take their collars off for a bath. they would get so confused, up until someone asked \u201cwhere\u2019s your pretty?\u201d or mentioned their pretty. i swear on my life, they would choose that collar over a treat", "This is what we do for our two!", "Seconding (or, thirding, I guess LOL) this suggestion. That's what I do. Just leave the collar attached to the leash.\n\nIt's especially helpful with mine, so we don't run around playing \"Catch the Pooka\" every morning! \ud83e\udd23"]}
