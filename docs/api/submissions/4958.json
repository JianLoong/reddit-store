He\u2019s got a nice (80$) collar that\u2019s made of leather and has a soft lining on the inside. \n\nMy gf likes to take the collar off of him every night so that he can sleep without the collar. She thinks it\u2019s more comfortable for him, which of course it probably is. \n\nBut what often happens in the morning when I want to take our dog for a walk in the park, his collar is somewhere in a random spot in the house and I have to go search for it. I find it quite annoying to have to search for his collar when I have limited time before work to walk your dog.\n\nSo I ask my girlfriend to stop taking the collar off, because it\u2019s a very nice collar that is well made and not tight on his neck at all. She says no, it\u2019s nice for him. I say okay, will you then put it back on him every morning so I don\u2019t have to search for the collar?\n\nShe says yes, but I can\u2019t expect her to put it back on him every morning because sometimes she could forget. I say okay yes of course.\n\nThen I say; Ok so to confirm, we agree that if you take his collar off, you will put it back on? And of course if you forget you forget and that\u2019s totally fine. Then she says \u201cI am not agreeing to anything right now, this conversation is not going well\u201d.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m absolutely fuming, I say I\u2019m really disappointed and take the dog out for a walk. When I come back I ask if we could chat about earlier and she says no, and that I should have to deal with my emotions around it.\n\nAm I the asshole for requesting this small thing? I\u2019m not crazy right? I feel like my girlfriend puts the idea of the dog\u2019s comfort at night above my need to be able to save time in the morning and not have to search for the collar.
