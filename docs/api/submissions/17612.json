We\u2019ve never excluded her from anything our kids (10,8,6) have done like birthdays, vacations, parties, etc. At my son\u2019s (8) birthday, my brother in law expressed that some of the other kids seemed afraid of his daughter and that some of the other parents gave her \u201cdirty looks.\u201d I wasn\u2019t aware of this and was carrying her around and happy to have her there. The brother in law didn\u2019t know exactly who did these things, but said in a text that his family didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be coming to any more events that we hold because our kids\u2019 friends and their parents seem weird or dismissive of their daughter. Fast forward to my daughter\u2019s 6th birthday party. I didn\u2019t invite them. I felt so awkward and weird and this is a VERY non confrontational family (for instance, I found out about this bc BIL texted my husband but no one ever spoke about it to me except my husband briefly telling me), but I didn\u2019t want to make the issue worse by inviting them when they\u2019d said they weren\u2019t going to come, so I didn\u2019t. They found out about the party thru a mutual friend and were devastated that I didn\u2019t invite them, believing that I didn\u2019t want their daughter around or something. (This is the first birthday in 7 years I haven\u2019t invited them to). I feel TERRIBLE. I love my niece and her family and have defended her to people (no one has ever said mean or rude things about her to me, I\u2019ve just explained her situation and tried to make her feel welcome and a part of things). Also, my husband and I were in the middle of a terrible marriage breakdown, discussing divorce, so there was almost no communication between us at all\u2014I didn\u2019t consult him about the invite, I just did it on my own because we were barely speaking at the time. If I ATA, is this something that can be repaired? I\u2019ve already sent multiple apologies, and asked to meet w them, but haven\u2019t been able to set a meeting bc of busyness.

You cannot control your kids friends parents. What's in the best interest for.your kids social development is having parties and inviting their friends. When kids are young, that means their parents are involved. It super sucks they didnt care enough to hide their feelings. \n\nYour BIL said he would no longer bring his daughter to your kids events which is sad in itself but understandable. So you didn't invite them. If he didn't mean what he said that's on him. You should try and have a discussion when you can but it sounds like you have a lot on your plate do NOT feel bad. This is a miscommunication at worse.", "NTA.  They said they would probably not come, so you made the decision not to invite them., which probably had more to do with your marital issues than it did with your niece.  If you thought you would be divorcing your husband, maybe you didn't want to be socializing with your brother-in-law's family at that time.  \n\nI hope you and your husband have been able to work things out in whatever way is best for you and your family.  As for your brother-in-law and his family, you have apologized, and they have said no hard feelings so take that at face value.  Continue to invite them and let them decide if they are able to attend or not.", "This story went in a different direction than I expected, and that\u2019s a good thing. (Well, not the part about your marriage. Sorry) No, you don\u2019t seem like an asshole. It\u2019s a simple misunderstanding, really. I could see it happening on a sitcom.\n\nMay I make a suggestion? If you\u2019re comfortable with it, could you send them a copy of this post? It explains things well, and your emotion comes through.", "NTA\n\nAnd your brother in law seems like hard work to be around - he\u2019s not coming because of micro aggressions which you never saw but he still wants to be with invited? What, did he want to refuse an invitation and then you would have to beg him to come and then he would grudgingly agree? \n\nSound exhausting.", "OP: \u201cWe love having your family with us for family birthdays. We adore your daughter.\u201d\n\nBIL: \u201cSome of the guests were uncomfortable with our daughter.  It was so awkward, we\u2019ve decided we won\u2019t attend in the future.\u201d\n\nOP: \u201cI understand.\u201d Doesn\u2019t invite niece to next party.\n\nBIL: \u201cHow could you leave us out?  We are so sad.\u201d\n\nThe moral of the story: be careful what you ask for.\n\nNTA", "In this situation, NAH. You had no ill-intention towards your niece or her family. You made the decision not to invite them based on what you understood from your brother-in-law's previous text message. He made it seem like they wouldn't be comfortable attending future events, so it was understandable that you would not want to put them in a situation where they might feel uncomfortable or unwelcome.\n\nHowever, your brother-in-law and his family may have interpreted this as you not wanting them at the party, which could understandably cause hurt feelings. Communication seems to be a key issue here. Perhaps if you had clarified their stance after receiving the text, this misunderstanding could have been avoided.\n\nThe fact that you've sent multiple apologies and have asked to meet with them shows you're willing to make amends. Continuing to express your regret over the misunderstanding and your love for their daughter will hopefully help in repairing the relationship. A face-to-face conversation would likely be best to fully address the issue and clear any misunderstandings.", "NTA. He said they were not going to come. You respected his choice. It sounds like he wanted the opportunity to turn you down.", "NTA. What you don\u2019t mention is how your kids feel about your niece\u2026 that\u2019s important too. \n\nI also want to add a personal anecdote because 1) I\u2019m neurodivergent and that\u2019s how I relate to things and 2) I was incredibly impacted by birthday parties for various reasons growing up. I was diagnosed with Autism (formerly Asperger\u2019s) in my  early 20\u2019s. Struggled with learning disabilities and social interactions through elementary and middle school. I honestly had 3 friends in elementary school, one of which didn\u2019t even go to my school. Middle school was just awkward\u2026 but I spent time in curriculum assistance aka independent special Ed where we\u2019d get extra help/be away from peers taking \u201cnormal\u201d electives. It was rough and something that I didn\u2019t want to be in, but didn\u2019t want to be in other electives either\u2026 regardless I was a decent human being and kind to almost everyone (there was this boy Jordan who liked to be almost explicitly flirtatious with me and he was the exception). There were only two other girls in that class - Gwen and Carly. I ended up being invited to one of their birthday parties, I\u2019m pretty sure it was Gwen because Carly was much less independent and had Down syndrome versus Gwen\u2019s personality disorder/neurodivergence. It was literally just the 3 of us at the party and her mother was near tears that I actually accepted the invitation and came and so excited Gwen had a friend. It was honestly probably the best birthday I\u2019d gone to because I didn\u2019t have to try and fit in they just accepted. The point I\u2019m trying to make is don\u2019t force it. Depending on where on the spectrum of functioning your niece is she might not even enjoy the parties and sometimes pushing for the inclusion makes it worse. \n\nIt also sounds like you and your husband were/are going through a lot. Maybe suggest in the future a separate celebration with them  so that no one is uncomfortable (including your niece)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
