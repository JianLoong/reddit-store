When kids are young, that means their parents are involved. It super sucks they didnt care enough to hide their feelings. \n\nYour BIL said he would no longer bring his daughter to your kids events which is sad in itself but understandable. So you didn't invite them. If he didn't mean what he said that's on him. You should try and have a discussion when you can but it sounds like you have a lot on your plate do NOT feel bad. This is a miscommunication at worse.", "NTA.  They said they would probably not come, so you made the decision not to invite them., which probably had more to do with your marital issues than it did with your niece.  If you thought you would be divorcing your husband, maybe you didn't want to be socializing with your brother-in-law's family at that time.  \n\nI hope you and your husband have been able to work things out in whatever way is best for you and your family.  As for your brother-in-law and his family, you have apologized, and they have said no hard feelings so take that at face value.

It explains things well, and your emotion comes through.", "NTA\n\nAnd your brother in law seems like hard work to be around - he\u2019s not coming because of micro aggressions which you never saw but he still wants to be with invited?

You made the decision not to invite them based on what you understood from your brother-in-law's previous text message. He made it seem like they wouldn't be comfortable attending future events, so it was understandable that you would not want to put them in a situation where they might feel uncomfortable or unwelcome.\n\nHowever, your brother-in-law and his family may have interpreted this as you not wanting them at the party, which could understandably cause hurt feelings. Communication seems to be a key issue here. Perhaps if you had clarified their stance after receiving the text, this misunderstanding could have been avoided.\n\nThe fact that you've sent multiple apologies and have asked to meet with them shows you're willing to make amends. Continuing to express your regret over the misunderstanding and your love for their daughter will hopefully help in repairing the relationship. A face-to-face conversation would likely be best to fully address the issue and clear any misunderstandings.", "NTA. He said they were not going to come. You respected his choice. It sounds like he wanted the opportunity to turn you down.", "NTA. What you don\u2019t mention is how your kids feel about your niece\u2026 that\u2019s important too. \n\nI also want to add a personal anecdote because 1) I\u2019m neurodivergent and that\u2019s how I relate to things and 2) I was incredibly impacted by birthday parties for various reasons growing up. I was diagnosed with Autism (formerly Asperger\u2019s) in my  early 20\u2019s. Struggled with learning disabilities and social interactions through elementary and middle school. I honestly had 3 friends in elementary school, one of which didn\u2019t even go to my school. Middle school was just awkward\u2026 but I spent time in curriculum assistance aka independent special Ed where we\u2019d get extra help/be away from peers taking \u201cnormal\u201d electives. It was rough and something that I didn\u2019t want to be in, but didn\u2019t want to be in other electives either\u2026 regardless I was a decent human being and kind to almost everyone (there was this boy Jordan who liked to be almost explicitly flirtatious with me and he was the exception). There were only two other girls in that class - Gwen and Carly. I ended up being invited to one of their birthday parties, I\u2019m pretty sure it was Gwen because Carly was much less independent and had Down syndrome versus Gwen\u2019s personality disorder/neurodivergence. It was literally just the 3 of us at the party and her mother was near tears that I actually accepted the invitation and came and so excited Gwen had a friend. It was honestly probably the best birthday I\u2019d gone to because I didn\u2019t have to try and fit in they just accepted. The point I\u2019m trying to make is don\u2019t force it. Depending on where on the spectrum of functioning your niece is she might not even enjoy the parties and sometimes pushing for the inclusion makes it worse. \n\nIt also sounds like you and your husband were/are going through a lot. Maybe suggest in the future a separate celebration with them  so that no one is uncomfortable (including your niece)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they were racist and we're giving her dirty looks because she was mixed race I think most people would expect them to drop the racist parents and I think it's the same here.

She cut off contact with her extended family, slowly but surely, because she thought people were judging her. They stopped taking my cousin out and partaking in family events and all that until she was 9.\n\n They're better now, they moved back to a more active city and found a school with the right curriculum. My aunt got help, but they'll never get those years back. \n\nYour niece has them. Your BIL, by letting strangers influence his daughter's opportunities to socialise, is cutting off a big source of development. It's not easy to not pay attention, but he has to. \n\nAnd honestly, fuck those people who look at her weird. Down syndrome isn't such an unseen condition in the wild. Strangers staring, if they really do stare, is ridiculous and the mark of ignorance, plain and simple. \n\nI hope you share this post with your BIL. \n\nYou didn't mean to hurt them, you didn't mean to exclude them.

They said this.out of emotional pain.  And you took them to their word.  It happens.\n\nAt the same time, I can see their point of view.  I have a severely autistic daughter (age 6) who has a global developmental delay.  I know how some kids and parents are.  I do believe their observations because I have seen this myself.  It does suck to go out in society then receive the glares, the rude comments, and one lady tried to film my kid only to get a video of my ass.  Then to go to a party of family where the external social rudeness exists making it feel isolating.\n\nI think the parents need caregiver support.  It is very isolating to have certain members of society look down upon a child with special needs.  I understand their hurt feelings.\n\nYou are not an arse here and neither are they.  There is just a whole bag of hurtful feelings going around.  Apologize and invite them and they need to realize that there is support out there (unfortunately resources vary region to region) and that when they say something like that out of hurt, they need to think that there are people who would hold them to their word.\n\nI do hope the best for them.  I hope they reach out for social support services.  It is not an easy task.  Also, I hope they know that people who act like snobs towards their kid, well that says a lot about those people in a negative way.\n\nYour life due to the issues presented is stressful as well.  I hope the best for you, too.", "Nta they expressed their displeasure and said they may not be at any future parties. Just speak to them direct and remind them of this comment.", "So I come from a family that sounds a lot like yours. I also have an intellectually disabled son, so I get both sides here. \n\nMy GUESS (I don\u2019t know this man) is that he was feeling isolated, conspicuous, tired and he vented. He thought it in the moment that he wouldn\u2019t come again, he hoped someone else would solve it for him, but when it comes right down to it he\u2019d like his family to be included. It can be very isolating and it hurts.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH. I think everyone needs to talk about this and agree on how best to accommodate this family. Assume from here on out that they want to be there or at least want the right of refusal, but he needs to communicate clearly too. He also may need some support on his end that it is okay to advocate for his little girl with other kids and to say, \u201cHi! I see you\u2019ve met Haley. She doesn\u2019t talk much but she loves other kids,\u201d or whatever. If he\u2019s not comfortable with this, maybe another outgoing family member can be his daughter\u2019s friendly advocate at these kinds of events.", "NAH exactly the 'we'd like to have been asked' argument is countered with \"I didn't want to make you uncomfortable since you said you didn't want to come.\"", "Exactly.  OP always included them, they were the ones who opted out.", "I can promise you that eugenics was not the answer to this problem.", "YTA", "INFO did you actually TALK with your BIL when you got the text said they didn't \"think\" they'd be coming to your events going forward?  That was really the time to hash things out and clarify what could be done to solve the issue.  Not sending the invite was a poor way to handle things and using your marital troubles as an excuse (I mean you were able to host a party and send out invites so it wasn't a situation where you were so overwhelmed you couldn't function).  \n\nI feel that YTA here-- and pushing off dealing with it because of \"busyness\" doesn't really fly here either.  Repairing the hurt you caused should be a top priority not something to postpone until it's convenient for you. (Are you perhaps hoping that after enough time passes you can just pretend in didn't happen?)", "NTA. You sound like a warm and kind person who did the best she could in a difficult situation. I would just continue to love your niece the best you can when you do see her. Hugs, hang in there!", "NTA. You based your decision not to invite her on BIL\u2019s statement that they would not be attending any more parties. You made a reasonable decision based on what had been said, though it might have been worth checking whether that was still the case or was just something said in the immediate frustration of the previous treatment of his daughter. Next time you will know better.", "Sounds like he's one of those 'I'm not coming, but I should at least get an invite I can decline ' people..... Which I find maddening", "How do you know that anyone was an elitist? Given that this is all based on her BIL\u2019s interpretation of strangers facial expressions, he could be mad that someone has RBF or that they were annoyed in general and looking at everything with an annoyed expression.", "Why are you so willing to believe the BIL got it wrong? He\u2019s probably seen those looks a lot when he\u2019s with his child.  The world is full of people who down on others who are different, who make them feel uncomfortable just because they exist", "So OP is in the wrong because you made up the \u201cfact\u201d that she has an idea of who it was?", "I didn\u2019t make up anything, what kind of mother doesn\u2019t know the people she\u2019s inviting to her kids party? She could have ask the BIL for a description and most likely figured it out"]}
