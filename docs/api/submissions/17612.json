We\u2019ve never excluded her from anything our kids (10,8,6) have done like birthdays, vacations, parties, etc. At my son\u2019s (8) birthday, my brother in law expressed that some of the other kids seemed afraid of his daughter and that some of the other parents gave her \u201cdirty looks.\u201d I wasn\u2019t aware of this and was carrying her around and happy to have her there. The brother in law didn\u2019t know exactly who did these things, but said in a text that his family didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be coming to any more events that we hold because our kids\u2019 friends and their parents seem weird or dismissive of their daughter. Fast forward to my daughter\u2019s 6th birthday party. I didn\u2019t invite them. I felt so awkward and weird and this is a VERY non confrontational family (for instance, I found out about this bc BIL texted my husband but no one ever spoke about it to me except my husband briefly telling me), but I didn\u2019t want to make the issue worse by inviting them when they\u2019d said they weren\u2019t going to come, so I didn\u2019t. They found out about the party thru a mutual friend and were devastated that I didn\u2019t invite them, believing that I didn\u2019t want their daughter around or something. (This is the first birthday in 7 years I haven\u2019t invited them to). I feel TERRIBLE. I love my niece and her family and have defended her to people (no one has ever said mean or rude things about her to me, I\u2019ve just explained her situation and tried to make her feel welcome and a part of things). Also, my husband and I were in the middle of a terrible marriage breakdown, discussing divorce, so there was almost no communication between us at all\u2014I didn\u2019t consult him about the invite, I just did it on my own because we were barely speaking at the time. If I ATA, is this something that can be repaired? I\u2019ve already sent multiple apologies, and asked to meet w them, but haven\u2019t been able to set a meeting bc of busyness.

You cannot control your kids friends parents. What's in the best interest for.your kids social development is having parties and inviting their friends. When kids are young, that means their parents are involved. It super sucks they didnt care enough to hide their feelings. \n\nYour BIL said he would no longer bring his daughter to your kids events which is sad in itself but understandable. So you didn't invite them. If he didn't mean what he said that's on him. You should try and have a discussion when you can but it sounds like you have a lot on your plate do NOT feel bad. This is a miscommunication at worse.", "NTA.  They said they would probably not come, so you made the decision not to invite them., which probably had more to do with your marital issues than it did with your niece.  If you thought you would be divorcing your husband, maybe you didn't want to be socializing with your brother-in-law's family at that time.  \n\nI hope you and your husband have been able to work things out in whatever way is best for you and your family.  As for your brother-in-law and his family, you have apologized, and they have said no hard feelings so take that at face value.  Continue to invite them and let them decide if they are able to attend or not.", "This story went in a different direction than I expected, and that\u2019s a good thing. (Well, not the part about your marriage. Sorry) No, you don\u2019t seem like an asshole. It\u2019s a simple misunderstanding, really. I could see it happening on a sitcom.\n\nMay I make a suggestion? If you\u2019re comfortable with it, could you send them a copy of this post? It explains things well, and your emotion comes through.", "NTA\n\nAnd your brother in law seems like hard work to be around - he\u2019s not coming because of micro aggressions which you never saw but he still wants to be with invited? What, did he want to refuse an invitation and then you would have to beg him to come and then he would grudgingly agree? \n\nSound exhausting.", "OP: \u201cWe love having your family with us for family birthdays. We adore your daughter.\u201d\n\nBIL: \u201cSome of the guests were uncomfortable with our daughter.  It was so awkward, we\u2019ve decided we won\u2019t attend in the future.\u201d\n\nOP: \u201cI understand.\u201d Doesn\u2019t invite niece to next party.\n\nBIL: \u201cHow could you leave us out?  We are so sad.\u201d\n\nThe moral of the story: be careful what you ask for.\n\nNTA", "In this situation, NAH. You had no ill-intention towards your niece or her family. You made the decision not to invite them based on what you understood from your brother-in-law's previous text message. He made it seem like they wouldn't be comfortable attending future events, so it was understandable that you would not want to put them in a situation where they might feel uncomfortable or unwelcome.\n\nHowever, your brother-in-law and his family may have interpreted this as you not wanting them at the party, which could understandably cause hurt feelings. Communication seems to be a key issue here. Perhaps if you had clarified their stance after receiving the text, this misunderstanding could have been avoided.\n\nThe fact that you've sent multiple apologies and have asked to meet with them shows you're willing to make amends. Continuing to express your regret over the misunderstanding and your love for their daughter will hopefully help in repairing the relationship. A face-to-face conversation would likely be best to fully address the issue and clear any misunderstandings.", "NTA. He said they were not going to come. You respected his choice. It sounds like he wanted the opportunity to turn you down.", "NTA. What you don\u2019t mention is how your kids feel about your niece\u2026 that\u2019s important too. \n\nI also want to add a personal anecdote because 1) I\u2019m neurodivergent and that\u2019s how I relate to things and 2) I was incredibly impacted by birthday parties for various reasons growing up. I was diagnosed with Autism (formerly Asperger\u2019s) in my  early 20\u2019s. Struggled with learning disabilities and social interactions through elementary and middle school. I honestly had 3 friends in elementary school, one of which didn\u2019t even go to my school. Middle school was just awkward\u2026 but I spent time in curriculum assistance aka independent special Ed where we\u2019d get extra help/be away from peers taking \u201cnormal\u201d electives. It was rough and something that I didn\u2019t want to be in, but didn\u2019t want to be in other electives either\u2026 regardless I was a decent human being and kind to almost everyone (there was this boy Jordan who liked to be almost explicitly flirtatious with me and he was the exception). There were only two other girls in that class - Gwen and Carly. I ended up being invited to one of their birthday parties, I\u2019m pretty sure it was Gwen because Carly was much less independent and had Down syndrome versus Gwen\u2019s personality disorder/neurodivergence. It was literally just the 3 of us at the party and her mother was near tears that I actually accepted the invitation and came and so excited Gwen had a friend. It was honestly probably the best birthday I\u2019d gone to because I didn\u2019t have to try and fit in they just accepted. The point I\u2019m trying to make is don\u2019t force it. Depending on where on the spectrum of functioning your niece is she might not even enjoy the parties and sometimes pushing for the inclusion makes it worse. \n\nIt also sounds like you and your husband were/are going through a lot. Maybe suggest in the future a separate celebration with them  so that no one is uncomfortable (including your niece)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they were racist and we're giving her dirty looks because she was mixed race I think most people would expect them to drop the racist parents and I think it's the same here. It's teaching the kids the message that sometimes people will be shitty to their cousin and they should just go along with it and not object, and not put those people out of their lives.", "I think the problem there then becomes do you risk your own child\u2019s social development and ostracise them because some of their friends\u2019 (unidentified) parents are AHs?\n\nAlso, BIL said he couldn\u2019t identify/name specifically who, and OP didn\u2019t notice.  So it also makes it harder to determine who to invite and who not to invite.\n\nWhat\u2019s the solution there?  Send a survey with the invite - check yes if you hate my niece with Downs?  Invite the child again and everyone else so you can watch yourself?

Do you still feel the same\" and YOU could've atleast told them \"btw just letting you know the party will be on such and such date\".\n\nInstead, based on a comment that was made months ago you simply dropped them. When they're the side affected there's a big difference between them CHOOSING to not attend a party and simply being dropped from it.

They can\u2019t have it both ways.. go to their home and talk to them and let them know why you didn\u2019t invite them.. I mean did they want you to invite them to turn it down and not show up or was bro just talking out the side of his mouth (and didn\u2019t mean it) this will teach you a lesson not to assume and will teach him a lesson about saying sh*t that he knows he doesn\u2019t mean.", "NTA.\n\nI'm honestly flabbergasted by your BIL. He should be happy that even if other people are pricks, his daughter is loved and was included in all your events.\n\nHe is the one who took looks to heart. I'm sure his daughter wasn't even paying attention and just enjoying herself with her cousins.\n\nI'm not saying it's easy for him. I have seen how parents change first hand with a special needs child.\n\nMy cousin has Down syndrome, and she lives in a country where the right care to help kids with Down syndrome develop and flourish is almost non existent. \n\nMy aunt, upon her birth, got so scared and paranoid that she moved her whole family to a super remote city where my cousin had literally no access to school and care. She cut off contact with her extended family, slowly but surely, because she thought people were judging her. They stopped taking my cousin out and partaking in family events and all that until she was 9.\n\n They're better now, they moved back to a more active city and found a school with the right curriculum. My aunt got help, but they'll never get those years back. \n\nYour niece has them. Your BIL, by letting strangers influence his daughter's opportunities to socialise, is cutting off a big source of development. It's not easy to not pay attention, but he has to. \n\nAnd honestly, fuck those people who look at her weird. Down syndrome isn't such an unseen condition in the wild. Strangers staring, if they really do stare, is ridiculous and the mark of ignorance, plain and simple. \n\nI hope you share this post with your BIL. \n\nYou didn't mean to hurt them, you didn't mean to exclude them. You were just trying to follow his wishes.", "nta", "You had information that they didn't want to come to parties in the future.\n\nYou didn't invite them to the next party.\n\nThey are now sad.

Just \"someone was giving dirty looks\" is not enough.", "She has no clue who was the individual who behaved that way. What was she supposed to do? Invite no friends?", "I don\u2019t buy that, I\u2019m guessing she has a clue.  And she\u2019s still in the wrong for not at least extended an invitation to BIL and his family. It\u2019s just common courtesy. And a way to show that they are always welcome."]}
