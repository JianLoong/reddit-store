She's a second year teacher. She was a teaching assistant for a year while she got the credits required to teach. Her school opened a second location with one classroom and she currently runs the location from 12-6:30 every day. \n\nWhen she started working at the school, I noticed she was running to the dollar tree or Walmart to grab little things for her classroom like hair ties, stickers, beads, and string. She said she didn't mind because it was all cheap and made her job easier. Then when she got her own classroom, she really started looking on next-door and buy nothing and shopping for her classroom more often. She got 24 outfits to store in her class (3 in each size from 2-5 for boys and girls) in case the parents forget to send new clothes, she has a box of pull ups in case a kid has an accident and doesn't have a spare pair of underwear, she has extra snacks, she has extra jackets and socks, a pack of combs and brushes, extra nap bedding, and bins of what she calls \"stalling activities\" (easy things she can pull out when she needs to stall). She even has halloween costumes in case one of her students doesn't have one and she gives away the blankets and jackets if she thinks a student needs them. \n\nI told her that all of this is excessive and she should leave it up to the owner of the school to get these things. She said the owner says these things aren't necessary but they don't cost much and they make her classroom run smoother. I told her that if the owner says it's unnecessary, don't get these things and let her see how the class runs without them. I told her I don't spend any money on my classroom and that if my principal isn't willing to buy it, the kids don't need it. She says it's different because I work at a $30k+ per year private school and she teaches in a more lower income community but I still told her it's not her responsibility. I also told her that her buying stuff for her classroom makes all of us that don't look bad but she doesn't care.\n\nShe's upset with me for being pushy but I'm just doing what's best for her.

It should bring you nothing but ridicule to say such a thing out loud. Seriously, what an asshole point of view! You should retire. This wasn't the career for you to begin with.", "YTA! You're really NOT doing what's best for her. You're doing what's best for you! She, literally, told you it helps her classroom run smoother, she doesn't mind, and it works for HER! Why do you feel the need to control your daughter, HER career and how she chooses to run it? Why would you choose to be unsupportive? You obviously raised a selfless, kind, generous and upstanding woman and you're literally trying to force your ways onto her to be the opposite. Just why? Because YOU wouldn't do it? Says more about you than her. YTA!", "YTA - she sounds wonderful and giving and kind and is going to truly make a difference in her kids lives.

It's none of your business what she does, and, contrary to what you seem to believe, it doesn't affect you in any way. Someone looking good doesn't automatically make everyone else look bad.

It's absolutely none of your business.", "YTA, big time. You care more about how people see you than about the quality of education that children get, and you have the gall to call yourself a teacher. It's her money, she can do what she wants with it, and what she wants to do with it is help out disadvantaged children.

She is helping children have a better time at school. I agreee the school should help, but that is simply not gonna happen by tomorrow, right?", "YTA, sorry. All the teachers I know do precisely this kind of thing. Friends who are/have been and my kid's teachers. They take so much pride in their classrooms. I always gift them good teacher gifts because I know how much work it is. One of my kid's former teachers is in my BN group, and I always gift her stuff if I have it when she asks if folks have things for an activity. Public school.

Your daughter understands that social and economics backgrounds matter in the development of children. \n\nIt's called diversity and accepting that affects children and their ability to learn. \n\nBitter much", "YTA. So many kids that I taught didn\u2019t get breakfast. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for their free school lunch to be their only hot meal of the day.   Having spare food ensured that they didn\u2019t go an entire morning hungry. It meant they were able to concentrate and do well in school. Some of the kids had developmental delays so having spare clothes, pull ups etc were essential for accidents. Not all kids had the luxury of being able to have a change of clothes at school much less come into school with clean clothes from home. A few of the kids I taught wore clothes too small for them and their shoes were falling apart from being too small. \n\nYour daughter teaches in a low income area. Some of those kids WILL be living below the poverty line or could even be living at a shelter where access to facilities are limited. \n\nAll your daughter is doing is making sure that EVERY CHILD has the same access to basic essentials and not widening the gap further between those that have these things and those that don\u2019t. \n\nYou are very privileged. You teach kids at a private school where very few children (if at all) will know of these kinds of struggles. Shame on you for shaming your daughter. As an educator, you should know better. \n\nHaving spare clothing, underwear, pull-ups, food etc. is essential for early years education. Children have accidents. Not all children are fully potty trained. You\u2019d be alarmed at the number of parents who think it\u2019s the teacher\u2019s job to potty train their 4 & 5 year olds and that having their kids in pull-ups is easier than potty training. This isn\u2019t all parents of course but there are some that think this is way. \n\n\nIf having spares makes your daughter\u2019s classroom run more efficiently then kudos to her. She\u2019s doing a great job at ensuring all of her kids needs are being met and that no one is expected to sit in soiled clothing or go hungry all day. It shows the kids that they matter. That they are loved and cared for. That they are safe. \n\nThis makes her an amazing teacher and you should be proud, not a judgemental AH. Shame on you OP. You are right in that it\u2019s not your daughter\u2019s responsibility. It\u2019s her school\u2019s responsibility so shame on your daughter\u2019s boss for also thinking this way. They should be providing these things so that doesn\u2019t feel like she has to provide basic necessities for some of these kids.", "YTA. \n\nYour daughter should have a harder time running her classroom, and her low income students should get even less because your daughter is making *you* look bad? \n\nWhy are you even teaching? Do you actually care about students or just the paycheck? You should be proud of your daughter and commend her efforts and her going the extra mile. She's one of the teachers who makes a huge difference to students and are remembered for what they do.", "YTA \u201cmakes the rest of us look bad\u201d. No you are making yourself look bad.

I\u2019d hate to have you as a teacher.", "You just opened my eyes up to why teachers are quitting. If the ones that *do love* the kids can't provide for those children, and help them in little ways (a cold kid gets a blankie, a hungry kid gets fed) then why are you even teaching?\n\nAnd it's none of your business how your daughter spends her hard-earned money. Let her enjoy the little she gets to keep!!\n\nPS - YTA", "YTA.  Why are you not proud of your generous, kind hearted daughter?  Sounds like she didn't get those traits from you.", "YTA. If you were concerned about your daughter is putting herself at risk financially, it\u2019s one thing. Your daughter sounds incredible! She is a caring and nurturing individual. She recognized the need in the community she teaches and is willing to go above and beyond to make her students feel welcomed and cared for. She shouldn\u2019t have to buy things for her classroom, but that is the reality for a lot of teachers. I hate she and others have to do it, but I love that we have people like this. My only concerned would be if your daughter gets burnt out overextending herself physically and financially. Otherwise, you should be very proud of her. \n\nI\u2019m not going to say you\u2019re a bad teacher, I\u2019m glad your school has enough funding that everything you need is provided for. Some teachers have to purchase school supplies for their classrooms.

When the kids are happy and well provided for, so am I, and our days together are happier, healthier, and more productive.

It's good to have spare things absolutely for the kids who don't have extra clothing because accidents happen and some parents don't have the money for jackets and shoes.  The owner of the preschool should be made aware of the needs and perhaps there can be a clothing drive for such things.  School supplies should be supplied by the school and not the teacher.

She shouldn't be buying all of that because teachers don't get paid enough and should not have to buy things out of their own pocket for their classrooms. The more teachers who just buck up and buy things out of pocket, the less likely it is were ever going to get properly funded schools.  The people in power will say, \"see, they're making it work! No changes needed!\" while the teachers bending over backwards to make it work are bending and bending and bending until they break. Thus the vicious cycle continues.\n\nIs she doing an amazing thing, providing for the kids in her class this way? Absolutely. Should she have to? Absolutely not.\n\nI honestly wish no teachers would spend out of pocket for an entire school year so the rest of the world can see how absolutely broken the system is.

She's a second year teacher. She was a teaching assistant for a year while she got the credits required to teach. Her school opened a second location with one classroom and she currently runs the location from 12-6:30 every day. \n\nWhen she started working at the school, I noticed she was running to the dollar tree or Walmart to grab little things for her classroom like hair ties, stickers, beads, and string. She said she didn't mind because it was all cheap and made her job easier. Then when she got her own classroom, she really started looking on next-door and buy nothing and shopping for her classroom more often. She got 24 outfits to store in her class (3 in each size from 2-5 for boys and girls) in case the parents forget to send new clothes, she has a box of pull ups in case a kid has an accident and doesn't have a spare pair of underwear, she has extra snacks, she has extra jackets and socks, a pack of combs and brushes, extra nap bedding, and bins of what she calls \"stalling activities\" (easy things she can pull out when she needs to stall). She even has halloween costumes in case one of her students doesn't have one and she gives away the blankets and jackets if she thinks a student needs them. \n\nI told her that all of this is excessive and she should leave it up to the owner of the school to get these things. She said the owner says these things aren't necessary but they don't cost much and they make her classroom run smoother. I told her that if the owner says it's unnecessary, don't get these things and let her see how the class runs without them. I told her I don't spend any money on my classroom and that if my principal isn't willing to buy it, the kids don't need it. She says it's different because I work at a $30k+ per year private school and she teaches in a more lower income community but I still told her it's not her responsibility. I also told her that her buying stuff for her classroom makes all of us that don't look bad but she doesn't care.\n\nShe's upset with me for being pushy but I'm just doing what's best for her. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I remember my favourite teacher in elementary school used to have \u201cfun fridays\u201d and we\u2019d literally just play games all day and we could win prizes and stuff and it was always so fun. The games were educational and about our curriculum so it wasn\u2019t like we were just having a rest day, it was really cool.
