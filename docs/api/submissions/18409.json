You know other people have noticed his smell so you did the right thing.\n\nOne thing that puzzles me, though, is why he complained to other people that you told him about his odor problem. I would think he would just try to fix it without complaining to your other friends. Is he that clueless about his own stink? \n\nThe problem could be his clothes, his body odor or lack of showers, but it could also be the food he eats.  If someone eats a lot of garlic, it stays in their system a long time and the garlic smell comes out of their pores. The other thing is, it could be his house. If his house is old and musty smelling and has old carpets, that would make all his clothes/hair stink. I knew a girl in high school who had that problem.\n\nAnyway, if he\u2019s going to complain about your truth-telling, Maybe you don\u2019t need him as a friend.", "NTA.

NTA.", "NTA  \nAfter reading the text you sent him (which you really should include in your OP), it's obvious you were acting completely sensitive to the situation. There's no way he could have misinterpreted the sensitivity you were showing to him about the situation... except... he likely spoke to his friends, didn't tell them about the whole text, and they started bashing you for saying anything. The friends went on the defensive for him, against you, and in a weird sort of gaslighting (for lack of a better word), made him think that you were attacking him when you were really just looking out for him and offering him help.", "NTA. You were being tactful in keeping the conversation between the two of you.

You probably could have had more tact about it.", "I guess you must have not been good enough friends because i told my friend that he smelled like a litter box that wasn\u2019t changed in a month that someone sprayed cologne on. We both laughed and he said he knew. It made it better when my roommate\u2019s 2 cats literally peed on him later that night. Fast forward to now and my man smells fabulous.

You can\u2019t determine \u201ctone\u201d in a text so you saying it was a nice tone doesn\u2019t mean it was received in a nice tone. The appropriate way to handle this would have been face to face. For all you know, he has a medical condition and you just slapped him in the face for it. He will probably never want to be around you again because it\u2019s embarrassing.

When my closest friend had told me about him talking about it I didn\u2019t figure it would ever happen because of the embarrassment, but later on a girl that\u2019s mad at me told me \u201cit\u2019s really embarrassing for him you should see his face\u201d but he\u2019s the one showing people the text?!?! It\u2019s all so weird", "Well that\u2019s the thing, a screenshot of the text is going around and people are acting so high and mighty about this I don\u2019t understand why. It was an extremely gentle mannered text. I sounded more supportive than I usually do with anything. I really wanted to walk on eggshells but it all exploded", "This is a good possibility but I think they\u2019re honestly just more mad about the fact that I said something period", "We go to a really nice college, he has a nice car, and his stuff is nice yes. his parents have him well off. he talks about it sometimes", "Well the ones mad at me weren\u2019t talking trash, just some other friends that are mutual with him a couple times in study group. I honestly fail to see any angle of this situation where I didn\u2019t have tact. I\u2019m not even this nice to myself", "Were definitely not besties but we\u2019re pretty close, I\u2019d say we\u2019re on the level of knowing about each other\u2019s home struggles and deep dreams but we\u2019re not hanging out everyday", "He doesn\u2019t have a physical medical issue because I\u2019ve witnessed him shower and smell good for a solid two days and then he just doesn\u2019t smell good again for awhile.

Literally the first time we talked about it I offered him one of my little travel deodorants and he said thank you I have my own", "INFO: What was the exact wording from the text?", "Right, because they want to ignore the issue and let someone else deal with it. They are likely thrilled that you said something because he'll likely start paying more attention to it, but they didn't have to be the \"bad guy\" in the scenario. With any luck, he will see them as coddling, and you as a godsend.", "In that case, based on the information provided, NTA. I would advise that you don\u2019t harp on this.  You\u2019ve said your piece, if he\u2019s not going to clean up, you should keep your distance.\n\nAs for your friends, if you\u2019ve made it clear that you didn\u2019t mean any harm by it, and you didn\u2019t harass him, then I would try and put this matter to bed. Make it clear that you aren\u2019t going to bring it up anymore. If they demand an apology, consider giving one, if only to keep the peace in the group.\n\nHygiene can be a very sensitive topic for people, as this situation has shown.", "I would have said it in person. Tone can be misread in a text. Saying it seems like you rarely shower and you make me nauseous, can come across a bit rude.", "You shouldn\u2019t gauge friendships based off of how much time you spend together. I never see my friend more than once or twice a month but we know about each others struggles, insecurities and accomplishments. We have very different political views as well but we both know we don\u2019t have to hide who we are from each other. Neither of us is afraid of being honest with the other. This means if he says something, I can take that as valid criticism or support. That\u2019s valuable in itself. \n\nPull back and look at the situation as objectively as possible. If you tell him: you will feel bad, he will feel bad, and YWBTAH. If you don\u2019t: you won\u2019t feel bad, he won\u2019t get his feelings hurt, he will continue to smell bad, it will be difficult for other people to get close to him, MANY people will dislike him (even if they don\u2019t admit it), he will actually realize that his stank is a big part of his struggles, he will get his feelings hurt, he was surrounded by friends that couldn\u2019t be honest with him to help him out because they didn\u2019t want to feel bad, he realizes all of his friends chose their own momentary comfort over trying to drastically improve his life.", "Don't listen to people telling you that you can't read tone. You absolutely can. I read your text posted above and it's impossible not to see the sensitive tone you chose. Unless he chose to not read the whole thing, or his friends convinced him that you're wrong because they don't want to admit he smells bad and confront him about it, you are fine here. And if he's that easily convinced that you were in the wrong, you might seriously consider just letting that friendship go.", "I'd argue that if someone smells bad enough after 2 days wihtout a shower  that you can't have them in your car, they likely have a medical issue.", "Plus it would be awkward like could you imagine a moment of silence and then me just being like \u201csoooo.. which soaps do y\u2019all use\u201d like what \ud83d\ude2d", "Yeah, indirect approach may be tactful, but isn't guaranteed to have results.\n\nBack in college I gave a girl a nice toiletries set and pretended it was some occasion or other. She was nice but unfortunately we all could smell her and her clothes, so I figured that was the nicest way to do it and would solve a potential money root cause.\n\nVery next day she comes and happily recounts how she gifted the set to someone else. Facepalm.", "Copy and pasted straight from the text:\n\nHey, I know that we\u2019ve become really close and that we\u2019re off to a great friendship. I just wanted to talk to you about something important. Lately I feel like you haven\u2019t been smelling super pleasant, like sometimes I have trouble sitting close to you or hugging you. Remember that time when we were hanging out with [REDACTED] and she sort of made a face to me after hugging you and you asked why and I changed the subject? well I really don\u2019t want to hurt your feelings and I know this is a sensitive issue, but it\u2019s just sometimes people really have a hard time getting close to you because of the smell. I really like you as a person and I don\u2019t want this to end just because of this. I don\u2019t know what might be going on in your life, but I want you to know that I\u2019m here for you if you need anything, anyone to talk to or any help with working through stuff. Love you x\n\nI also want to make it clear that I didn\u2019t make a face back at her or anything, I just smiled and he noticed and asked about it but I started to talk about ordering some drinks", "No no it wasn\u2019t immediately back to smelling bad, sorry I said that in a way that made it seem like that was the case. But no it was around a few days before I actually took notice to the stench again. But if we\u2019re being honest as someone who\u2019s on the go a lot and exercises everyday, a body clean is a must at least once a day. After two days I start to smell not so pleasant", "OMGGG that\u2019s so awkward, the thing is people who struggle with it are so so so sweet and kind most of the time. When I was in middle school I would forget to wear deodorant because I wasn\u2019t used to needing it but trust me I did. so I\u2019ve been in those shoes before. it can be embarrassing but it\u2019s important to take care of yourself", "I think that text was really nice and appropriate.  \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "Thanks for posting it - you may want to edit that into your OP as it helps give more perspective.\n\nHonestly I'm having a hard time with a ruling personally. I do think you genuinely meant well overall and care about this person. It sounds like you put thought into this text too and tried to be sensitive, exemplify your point, etc. I also can understand how a lot can get lost in translation over text, which I realize has been pointed out already in the comments.. But nonverbal cues are huge and this is definitely a conversation that I'd have chosen to have face to face. I think your friend probably genuinely did not interpret it the way you intended.. I'm not sure how your friends that are angry are behaving towards you but I don't think it's something you should be vilified for either though. I hope everything settles down for all of you.", "thank you I\u2019ve had a lot of experience texting people serious mannered things so I thought I did good as well"]}
