If someone eats a lot of garlic, it stays in their system a long time and the garlic smell comes out of their pores. The other thing is, it could be his house. If his house is old and musty smelling and has old carpets, that would make all his clothes/hair stink.

Remember that time when we were hanging out with [REDACTED] and she sort of made a face to me after hugging you and you asked why and I changed the subject? well I really don\u2019t want to hurt your feelings and I know this is a sensitive issue, but it\u2019s just sometimes people really have a hard time getting close to you because of the smell.

I do think you genuinely meant well overall and care about this person. It sounds like you put thought into this text too and tried to be sensitive, exemplify your point, etc. I also can understand how a lot can get lost in translation over text, which I realize has been pointed out already in the comments.. But nonverbal cues are huge and this is definitely a conversation that I'd have chosen to have face to face. I think your friend probably genuinely did not interpret it the way you intended..

I hope everything settles down for all of you.", "thank you I\u2019ve had a lot of experience texting people serious mannered things so I thought I did good as well", "I think you were trying to be helpful, but it was ineffective.  Now it's time for you to go talk with this man's RA who has professionals with whom he can consult and decide if it's appropriate to intervene and if so, how.\n\nAs for you, if you don't want to be in a study room with this guy because of the stench, leave the room.  If you don't want him in your car, don't invite him in. Behavior does have consequences and sadly, this may be one consequence of him not taking steps to reduce the stink.\n\nNTA", "NTA. A real friend would tell him. You seemingly care for him a lot, and reading the text you sent him - you can tell you were trying to be sensitive to the issue but still address it. I wonder if this convo wouldn\u2019t went differently if you were to say it in person and not via text? \n\nAs for your friend\u2019s negative reaction- it could be just that he is insecure and doesn\u2019t like having to face this problem. Maybe a medical problem? Some kind of trauma associated with the showers? Idk..\n\nI think your friends need some time to grow up and see this issue in a different perspective. Freshmen in college mean y\u2019all are still really young. I\u2019m sure down the road they\u2019ll see you\u2019re not being an AH. Maybe you can meet with your friend face to face, one on one and try to resolve the issue.", "NTA.  You are more of a friend than most, because bad hygiene will set him back in life.   Perhaps he needs a product like Tide Hygienic detergent for his clothes\u2026 perhaps his clothes have absorbed a lingering musty smell from sitting in the washer too long. He probably has grown accustomed to the stench.  \nMaybe his deodorant isn\u2019t sufficient and needs to be switched\u2026\n\nI find making people aware is a courtesy.  I would want to know.\n\nI think this is a case of \u201cshooting the messenger\u201d", "NTA. This is a really sensitive, difficult conversation to have with someone, and it sounds like you did it as gently and deliberately as possible. I don\u2019t think you were mean or making fun of him\u2014you told him a painful truth that was important for him to hear.\n\nEspecially as a freshman in college, like\u2026 you\u2019re not wrong. He might be depressed. He might be having a hard time managing his own schedule, if he\u2019s still used to a parent reminding him to get up on time and go shower. He might not know how to do his own laundry, and feel weird and bad about asking anyone (especially given how it sounds like he reacts to any kind of feedback that leaves him feeling embarrassed).\n\nIf you still want to be friends with this guy, I think it\u2019s worth making one more overture. Send a message to the effect that you\u2019re sorry if he was hurt or upset; you\u2019re really not trying to be mean or make him feel bad; you\u2019re just trying to be a caring, honest friend, and protect your friendship. Maybe he\u2019ll bite, maybe not.\n \nIf you don\u2019t\u2014or if you give it a shot, and he\u2019s still mad\u2014I\u2019d really encourage you to talk to his RA, assuming he lives on-campus, or to get in touch with campus mental health services, if not. Universities have established systems for intervening and offering support in situations like this one\u2014it will not be the first time it\u2019s come up. We had someone in my dorm, my freshman year, in a similar position. Turned out she had just\u2026 been home-schooled, had every second of her schedule dictated to her, her entire life, and had a stay-at-home mom who did all the cleaning, tidying, and laundry, without a pause to teach her kid how to do it. She had no idea when to go take a shower, with no one telling her to, and neither knowledge nor quarters for the laundromat. \n\nYour friend also genuinely needs help, whether it\u2019s a mental health problem, a logistical issue, or both\u2014his other freshman-year buddies might be willing to hold their noses and turn a blind eye, but like. Will a prospective date? Or a job interviewer, ffs? He\u2019s already mad about it; he might as well get some help out of the deal.\n\nAs far as your other friends go\u2026 I\u2019m sorry they\u2019re being jerks about this. The least they could do is give you some credit, for doing the difficult thing that they wouldn\u2019t. If it were me, I\u2019d come up with a simple, one-line answer for when they bring it up, and repeat it until they drop it. Something short and sweet like\u2014\u201cI made the best decision I could, in a difficult situation. I\u2019m not going to keep arguing about it with you.\u201d Should do nicely. Or\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll discuss this directly with [friend who smells bad], if he wants to. I\u2019m not willing to talk about it with anyone else.\u201d They\u2019ll get over it and move on, or they\u2019ll get the message that you have, eventually.\n\nGood luck, man. I hope your friends chill tf out. And once again, for the road\u2014NTA.", "NTA- based on the message, you said this as politely as possible. I'd be worried something more serious is going on too. Very rarely do people not shower for the sake of not showering.", "NTA you did the right thing. Good friend in my book.", "NTA I would consider showing your other friends screenshots of what you ACTUALLY said, and let them know that you were genuinely trying to help. They probably got a completely different story, and that sucks, but you had good intentions. Hearing that you smell is a painful thing though (unless he just doesn't care?), so I don't blame him for being upset", "NTA, if it is just the usual gamut of horrifying body odors. People legit need to have personal hygiene to a small degree otherwise it can be highly distracting and offputting.\n\nHowever, if this odor is a weird lingering fishlike stank from hell that persists and legit has you on the verge of vomiting to be near despite they indeed are bathing, then that might be trimethylaminuria (but a rare condition most know of by this point in life if they have it)", "NTA. Ive had a situation where i was the stinky one. I convinced myself its not that bad and i bet others cant smell it. Lol yes they did. One girl told me that i smell and i was embarassed as hell. But guess what, it hit me hard and i never wanted to hear that again. I may not smell like flowers but i never stink, i make sure of that. You did the kid a favor by telling him.", "OMG, don\u2019t do this. Respect the privacy of a 1:1 conversation and don\u2019t contribute to the gossip that has built around this topic. Sharing screenshots of conversations is really immature, regardless of how frequently it happens. And how often do you see it RESOLVE a conflict or gossip versus escalate one?\n\nLook, you were NTA for saying something the first time, but when it became clear that this wasn\u2019t going to change, you should have recognized the limitations of your own influence. \n\nAlso, let be this a lesson in the value of communicating in person, with your voice, and eye contact and body language about something sensitive that someone is liable to feel uncomfortable discussing.", "So he should tell him and not be a fake AH - which is what he did\n\nHe did the right thing to tell him. \n\nNTA Op", "I think op did it the best way because it WASNT face to face. It allowed op to carefully consider wording AND it allowed for op to have proof of what they said. Just like they posted it here. \n\nNowadays almost every communication is safer done in a written manner so no one can lie, twist words, or embellish. It didn\u2019t save op in the friend group, but 9/10 being able to show a screenshot makes a world of difference. \n\nMostly though, it allowed this guy to \u201chear\u201d what op had to say within the privacy of his own mind and not facing this person directly. I\u2019m sure the guy is embarrassed on some level and hearing this to my face= I\u2019d want to die on the spot. \n\nLastly, I think the guy preemptively went to the friend group to establish his side/opinion on OPs text on the hopes people turn on op and emphasize with himself possibly as a diversion tactic. (If group thinks op is bullying me, he\u2019ll stop bringing it up, he\u2019ll be kicked from study group, and people will be outraged on my behalf and stop gossiping)", "NTA. People confuse being uncomfortable with the idea that someone did something wrong \u2014 although it was an unpleasant truth for your friend, it\u2019s better that he knows, and you told him as gently as possible. Also, these other friends just want to be part of drama and are making mountains out of molehills. You were a good friend.", "NTA  You tried to help.   No good deed goes unpunished.  Wait till he's out in the real world and can't hold a job because he's nasty.   No favors ignoring the obvious.", "Maybe AH but maybe he needed this to grow personally. This happened to a guy (J) in my residence in university. The guy grew up very poor , rural and socially isolated. Shared bathroom, I think he was embarrassed to be seen undressed, and thought bathing once a week was ok. His roommate sat him down ( alcohol was involved) and explained that their room stank, he stank. He cried. But there after J showered daily , modernized his clothing and the guys even helped him get a GF ( positive but honest feedback). He came out of his shell afterwards, he became fully accepted as a brother ( it was a \u201cfrat\u201d like situation).", "NTA and I'm having the same issue at work with a colleague. He doesn't wash his work trousers and it reeks of filth. We work in a very dirty setup to make it worse. Like he'd be on shift on Monday and I'll be at work on Tuesday and I KNOW HE'S BEEN AT WORK because how bad the crew room stinks.\nYour friend needs to do better.", "NTA... he needs to know, he may also need to see a doctor.  \n\nWhen letting someone know, always do this in private. Be kind, be matter of fact. \n\n\nI've had to do this with family and friends. One not educated on hygiene by her absent mom.  One depressed.  One older and with bladder leaks and reduced smell. All need a few reminders, but finding themselves socially isolated would not have helped them in the end. \n\nIf he asks you to stop, then that's it. But you dont have to put up with it."]}
