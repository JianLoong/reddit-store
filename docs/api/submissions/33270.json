We've been together since high school, and last year he proposed to me. Since then we've been taking our time planning our wedding, and managed to book a pretty popular venue that we are both really excited for. My best friend since middle school (Abby 22F) has designed and made a custom wedding dress for me, which looks absolutely stunning and I couldn't be happier with it.\n\nNow a few months ago I discovered I was pregnant. It came as a surprise but we're both really happy about it. With the wedding already having been planned however, I'll definitely be showing quite a bit during my wedding. Abby has been working on modifying the dress so I'd still be able to wear it (she's the best honestly!). \n\nLast weekend I had a fitting for the dress and my mom and aunt accompanied me. After I put on the dress, I was so happy because it looked amazing! It doesn't try to hide my pregnancy belly, but it made everything look so elegant. My mom and aunt started laughing though, saying I look ridiculous and that it'd be better to postpone the wedding until after I give birth. \n\nBesides the fact that postponing the wedding means we'll have to wait at least another year because the venue is so popular and pretty much always booked, I thought I looked beautiful so their comments really hurt me. It really hurt Abby as well as she'd been working so hard on the dress.\n\nI told my mom and aunt that they're being incredibly rude and that they're not welcome at my wedding unless they apologize, but they responded by saying I'm overreacting and that I need to learn to take a joke. They're just trying to make sure I have the perfect wedding that I won't regret later, and that my pregnancy hormones are making me make bad decisions.\n\nI sent them away at that point to finish the fitting without them, but now I'm really doubting myself whether I really was overreacting.

Your hormones can fog your brain and make your emotions stronger, but that is not an excuse to hurt you and then blame you for being hurt. Which is exactly what they did.
