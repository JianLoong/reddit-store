We've been together since high school, and last year he proposed to me. Since then we've been taking our time planning our wedding, and managed to book a pretty popular venue that we are both really excited for.

After I put on the dress, I was so happy because it looked amazing! It doesn't try to hide my pregnancy belly, but it made everything look so elegant.

They're just trying to make sure I have the perfect wedding that I won't regret later, and that my pregnancy hormones are making me make bad decisions.\n\nI sent them away at that point to finish the fitting without them, but now I'm really doubting myself whether I really was overreacting.
