It\u2019s a two way thing. Your friends have been in a comfort zone with you visiting and now, rightfully, you\u2019re not going to do that. Good on you. I suspect when their kids were young they didn\u2019t want to travel and you were childless so it worked. Now their kids are older, potentially easier to travel with, and you have a baby and are pregnant and THEY are still EXPECTING you to travel ? As for them being nearby and not visiting. WTF.\n\nHusband needs to get onside here and see reason. Travelling with little ones is NOT easy.\n\nMy situation: my partner\u2019s family all live in France, and we live in UK. They are all French. We have two children, 4.5 (f) and 2.5 (m). Her parents have visited us TWICE in 4.5 years. A flight from France on easyJet is as cheap as \u00a328 or on average about \u00a350. It\u2019s so easy for them to pack a bag and come for a long weekend. But no. To top it all off they go travelling all over the world at least twice a year !! My partner\u2019s brother is the same, him and his gf have visited us ONCE since our daughter was born, they have no children yet. Both parents and brother are significantly more affluent than us. \n\nIn contrast we have visited them 2 or 3 times a year, every year for the last 8 years. \n\nSince we\u2019ve had children it\u2019s a lot harder. 90 min drive to the airport, through the airport stuff, 1hr 20 flight, out the other end then a 1 hr drive. It\u2019s a nightmare with toddlers and takes from 4am to mid afternoon, best part of a day. We\u2019ve invited them for Xmas the last 4 years and none of them have come. All sorts of excuses. Subsequently we have now stopped the frequent visits. Feels like we\u2019re making all the effort and paying the price for it, and they get us handed to them on a plate. I can\u2019t imagine that when my children have their own kids that I simply won\u2019t visit my own grandchildren. But there you are. It got to a point, like you, where we said enough is enough.\n\nIn short, stick to your guns. Do what\u2019s right for you. Your family unit is the most important thing here.", "NTA.

The road goes both ways.", "DEFINITELY NTA! \n\nI can sympathize as I have had similar experiences with my friends.  We have frequently gone to see them, and every year they promise to visit us, and every year there is another reason it falls through. \n\nYou need to take care of yourself and your family. A friendship needs to be nurtured by both parties, you can extend the offers and send them messages. However, they also need to contribute.", "NTA. Your pregnancy is high risk, so traveling isn't even an option here, and even if it wasn't you are well within your rights to be less interested in traveling after not being visited yourself. Now, it should be said that having children is teens or twenties doesn't mean those parents are as available as you were without kids, there still should have been more effort on their part.", "NTA\n\nThese people are not your friends.", "Yeah, the part in the OP where she says the friends have traveled to near where they lived and not visited is telling.

They keep promising to visit; it's just not happening.", "My question as well.", "Sounds like they are fair weather friends.
