WTF.\n\nHusband needs to get onside here and see reason. Travelling with little ones is NOT easy.\n\nMy situation: my partner\u2019s family all live in France, and we live in UK. They are all French. We have two children, 4.5 (f) and 2.5 (m). Her parents have visited us TWICE in 4.5 years. A flight from France on easyJet is as cheap as \u00a328 or on average about \u00a350.

It's like he knows the OP shouldn't be travelling but he wants to blame her for not going himself.", "I'm not saying I'm never traveling again but I am saying I don't want my child who still under the age of two to be away from me for a week. It wouldn't be a two-day trip, because his friends insist they wouldn't have enough time to bond with her.", "I think your paranoia is 100% justified, and completely understandable. NTA.\n\n  \nI like the other poster's suggestion about creating an event for people to come to you. It sounds like they got used to y'all being the traveling couple. I don't want to believe their treatment of you is malicious, just un-thought-out.", "Oh that's easy... You need to travel with her... as you should have done in the last year and 3 months!!", "NTA. People who aren't willing to travel to you but repeatedly pester you to travel to them aren't worth the trip.", "NTA\n\nI had two under the age of two and had family tell me that it was too much for me to expect them to travel 2 hours to come and see me, that they preferred I do the traveling with the children. Grandparents in their early 50's couldn't travel 2 hours to see their only grandchildren. Needless to say, my children would have a hard time picking these individuals out of a line-up if they had to now. Some people do a really good job of showing you how much they value you, believe it when you see it.", "NTA\n\nThe roads work both way.\n\nYou visited for years, it's their turn now.", "NTA. This is when you realize who actually cares for you... I had something like this happen with my sister. When she had her first born she made us God-parents and declared we have to come visit them at least once a year, because her kid is to young to travel. More then 10 years later - she had two by then - I got pregnant. She came for the birth, and later for the wedding. We went down Wen the kid was one year, but found it to difficult, so we told her now it's her turn (and she was his godmother, and saw him maybe two times, he is now 16) . Nope. I saw them once more, they came by while visiting near by, and told me no, they wouldn't come to us. Later I heard that she was regularly close by, even at my birthday, without calling me. I will never call her, that was that for me. We met on some occasions, but I didn't put in any effort, I had put in enough in all those years.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nTell your husband to stop being so desperate for friendship with people that just aren't interested in being your friends enough to make the bare minimum effort to travel to see you occaisionally.", "NTA \n\nI moved away from my friends and family for work, and I visit them way more often than they do me, and I get that it makes more sense for me to travel there and visit all of them, but I stopped making people a priority who never visit me. \n\nYou have a toddler who hates travel AND a high risk pregnancy, they have kids they can leave alone for a couple days - it makes no sense that you should be the one to travel.\n\nThey\u2019re showing you how you important you\u2019re to them - it might be time to cut your losses", "Nope, your response to your hub was perfect. Why should you be making the effort, at risk nonetheless, for people who wouldn't do the same for you. Nta", "INFO you said you are 8 hours from your circle of friends, does that mean that there are multiple people in the same area and you live elsewhere? If you moved away then you are the one who would generally travel back \"home\" to see your friends.\n\nWith your pregnancy and risk of course you shouldn't travel now.\n\nThat does not mean that he can't go and that he can't bring the child. That is where you are being unreasonable.\n\nYou should definitely invite your friends to visit you again and let your husband visit them if he wants.", "NTA. As someone who has ALWAYS had to do the traveling on holidays (with children), it bugs the heck out of me when people expect YOU to do the traveling. They always have some excuse why they don't have to do it, and it sucks. Put your foot down. You are in a high-risk pregnancy AND you have a toddler! Stay put and they need to come visit. Your husband should be staying home with you also.", "Wow, I completely missed that. How unbelievably selfish. Clearly OP is not a priority for these people. Yikes.", "I actually just joined a church group for moms!

Consider an edit.", "While you're NTA for not wanting to travel while pregnant. Your husband is as much of a parent as you are. So why cant he take them to visit his friends? Its equally up to him to take the child places not just you.", "Oh love, I've been here. You are too medically fragile with your pregnancy, as is your child who should not be missing therapy sessions, for a trip to people who couldn't be bothered to stop in when they were in your area. Your husband needs to face facts and grow a damn backbone.  These people aren't your friends. It's going to hurt for him to admit it more than likely but it needs said. Let.them.go. They've shown you who they are. Wishing you a safe pregnancy and recovery.", "NTA. Everything you stated is perfectly reasonable", "NTA. Take care of your babies, be a homebody and enjoy your life. You can travel anytime when they are older and if these are true friends, they will understand.", "NTA. You are high risk pregnant! Listen to your doctor, do not travel.

But you need to stay put.", "NTA  \nSounds like one way friendship, quite literally!  \nI wouldn't bother if I were you! No need to put yourself in a dangerous situation with an uncomfortable toddler as well.  \nGood luck!", "NTA, You go Mama Bear!", "YTA for controlling your husband. The child is his kid too, and if he wants to take a trip with the older child, why on earth would you try to stop him? He has no free will? He has no freedom to be alone with his child? You can't be alone for a few days? Get off your high horse and stop punishing your husband because you're angrier than he is about the lack of visits.", "I like this. \ud83d\udc4d", "[removed]", "Except all those \u201cfriends\u201d that know exactly how difficult it is are still asking her to do it anyway.", "Very bold/stupid to [copy from OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yxoch/aita_for_refusing_to_travel/j807lqs/) herself, bot.", "You\u2019re NTA, because your friends aren\u2019t reciprocating. Totally fine if you\u2019re nervous to travel with a high-risk pregnancy, and that makes you even more NTA. If he wants to, why don\u2019t you let your husband take your toddler. How bad can it be? Plan breaks, bring snacks, load up the iPad with Cocomelon, etc. and break all the rules for one day of travel. Once kiddo figures out that he\u2019s gonna be in the car for a while, he\u2019ll figure it out. You might get a nice break out of your husband and toddler going and a dad/child vacay. \n\nI\u2019m sure you know from experience, but most kids get used to things that you do with them often. If you want to be able to travel with your child, you just have to practice. And kids can get used to just about anything. I found it super easy to travel with my daughter when she was a young infant, because she slept so much. We took her everywhere. She could travel and sleep like a champ. It\u2019s definitely a little trickier with a toddler, but we make it work. \n\nWe have to travel 11 hours by car to visit my parents, 8 hours to my in-laws, and 7 hours in the other direction to my sister\u2019s place. Most of our close friends live in two different towns, 7 and 8 hours away. Flying doesn\u2019t make sense for us, because most of the places we visit would require us to rent a car once we got to the closest airport. We have done those long drives multiple times while pregnant, with a 3/4mo old, a 9mo old, a toddler, and we usually travel with an excitable husky in the car too. My family has had to figure out how to make long car trips work pretty much from the beginning. We live in a vacation destination, so we have had to vacation where people live\u2014as it\u2019s too expensive here for many of our loved ones to visit at holiday times. Seeing the people we love us important to us, so we have figured out how to make long road trips work. \n\nPoint being, you don\u2019t have to travel to visit your friends if you don\u2019t want to, but if you did it\u2019s definitely possible. It just has to be important enough to you.", "NTA these people are not your friends", "I don't understand the husband's frustration here. Wtf doesn't he realize how unfair it is? \nOP is NTA", "NTA if these people wanted to meet your child, they would have done so by now.  They're expecting you to travel pregnant and with a 2 year old to see them, when they haven't bothered to see you, absolutely not.\n\nIt's not unusual for some friendships to fizzle out once people start having kids and get in different phases of life, but that your family has done this too is really sad.", "NTA", "NAH, but do they all live in the same place and you moved away?  Sounds like it\u2019s a group of friends, so if they\u2019re all in one place I get why they\u2019d prefer that you come to them.  It doesn\u2019t sound like they think you\u2019re AHs for not coming, but it\u2019s more an argument  with your husband.  Hopefully you\u2019ll get to a point where at the very least he can visit his friends.", "Not exactly the same situation, but we're a military family. We currently live 6ish hours from my family and 18ish from my husband's. We have literally traveled across the world to visit family, and now that we're within a relatively close visiting distance, not a single person outside our parents have come to visit. I've learned the hardway to not put effort into people who won't return the effort. We miss our families but there's a lot less stress now that we're not dragging our kids around the country. NTA", "ESH, if you are the only ones out of the group to be so far away then it's not all that surprising that your friends expect you to go to them instead of the group come to you.\n\nDecide if these friendships are important to you.\n\nIt's pretty crappy to be upset they didn't visit during your pregnancy or right after birth since the vast majority of people don't actually want a house full of people during those times.", "Info: did covid perhaps have something to do with the fact that they have not been visiting?", "This. I am in this exact situation with my (51M) and my wife's (48F) one year old daughter, and a series of adult friends we each had from our childless years. \n\nFor practical and financial reasons we can't trek hither and yon with a toddler who hates to be in the car for more than 30 minutes a throw. The friends who have gone out of their way to come to us have become precious to us.", "Including her husband? He's not allowed to go on a trip with his own child?", "Ta da!!!  This is wonderful.", "Why do they need to bond with her?? That is your daughter, not theirs", "Did you completely gloss over where she said her 1st born has seizures? I have family that has seizures, they do travel but they started having seizures later in life and are older and know what steps to take to be safe and know and have medicine and treatments that help them.\n\nIt is a whole different ballpark for babies/toddlers/children that young. And in fact, can be dangerous, especially with a parent that isn't as familiar with the condition and is so far away from the child's primary care provider.\n\nAnd the OP has a high-risk pregnancy, I can just picture how stressful HRP on top of having such a young child with a health condition.\n\nIt really does give off the vibes that the husband wants to maybe directly or in-directly lay blame on if he doesn't go to visit, AH move even after OP expressed her blessing for him to visit them.", "NTA\n\nNot over kids, but I've been there before. Always having to be the one to travel is absolutely exhausting. Do not put effort into people who won't do the same for you", "Relationship is two ways, you should make an effort they should make an effort too. It's seemed you the only one making effort here.

It is like you are beggars and are only worth spending time with when there is little to no effort involved on their part. They don't seem to put the same value on the friendship that you have, certainly not the same effort.", "Nah. They don't care. She's pointed out they don't even stop when they are nearby for other ressons.", "Especially now that they don\u2019t have young children anymore. Why on earth would OP put herself at a risk of miscarriage during a high risk pregnancy just so some \u201cfriends\u201d can meet her toddler that doesn\u2019t travel well when those \u201cfriends\u201d have never come to visit them?", "Touche friend touche... your example is irrelevant as your experience does not apply, second she had a high risk pregnancy then gave birth and I even gave her an extra 6 months of no traveling... all while the covid pandemic was happening when she should NOT have been traveling at all... but that still leaves a year at least of an open window for all 3 of them to travel, the husband want to introduce his daughter to his childhood friends that remained friends since kindergarten... no blame to lay at all... and she shut the whole debate down... No need to gloss over anything at all, it's just HAS to be her way..."]}
