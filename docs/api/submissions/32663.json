A ton of people does this, and not only with gay jokes.\n\nI simply cannot come to terms with the world today where everyone and everything is being made malicious when, in reality, in the vast majority of cases the explanation is far more shallow and innocent. I mean \"gays are buying all of my musical tickets\". How can you imagine that sentence and see it as anything else other than an absurd joke? Not your type of funny? Fine. But how do you get it to become insulting?", "A straight guy using gay as an insult and trying to chuckle about \u201chomos\u201d with his straight girlfriend is homophobic, how is NOT :S", "Like I said Im not against this because I myself is gay and I use some of these terms too. \n\nBut OP finds it offensive. \n\nIm just responding to OP\u2019s post that he used these terms in the past and OP also addressed this before about using that word. \n\nSo this should not be news to the bf. \n\nIm purposely not including a YTA or NTA in this thread.", "How is that a freaking insult?! It's a stereotype \"gay people like musicals\". It's a harmless sterotype. \"Gay people have loads on unprotected sex\" is a dangerous stereotype.\n\nA situation when a straight guy is having issues buying musical tickets online and is complaining about homosexuals buying all of their tickets is absurd. It's satirical. It's a cheap joke, sure, but how the hell does it make it insulting?\n\nIf he refused to buy the tickets because \"musicals are gay\", that would be homophobic. But this? \n\nAnd one more thing, I love the fact the word \"straight\" (as in normal, conventional etc.) is widely accepted for heteros. Absurdity in it is that it's ok to call a hetero straight (or normal), which then makes a homo person abnormal. I find this a lot more insulting to gay people than a bloke making silly jokes in his own living room.", "So can you usually tell if someone is using gay jokes as simple stupid jokes because they \"fit\" a situation, or when there is homophobia underneath the surface?\n\nOP said he uses gay as an insult, but to what extent? Is it constant? Is it malicious? Or did he blur out the \"Gaaaaay\" meme twice during their relationship? We have no context here, so I am taking this one joke as the only criteria. If she provided examples of how he behaved in the past, that would be better.  Plus, she took this joke as an insult, so I am inclined to think that she might be overreacting about his use of \"gay insults\".", "OP said her boyfriend uses gay as an insult. \n\nBut sure, nothing wrong with blokes making jokes right? No harm in jokey blokes making blokey jokes", "Like I said Im not against this but personally I don\u2019t necessarily care if someone uses that term; especially jokingly. \n\nIt isn\u2019t too hard to decipher if the term is used maliciously; especially if you are dating someone. \n\nRegardless of what OP has said, she made her joking boundary with that term. And I can absolutely understand and agree that using GAY as a derogatory word is wrong and should be changed in general.", "OP said his stupid joke was offensive and then threw a tantrum. Obviously, I don't agree with that so I am not going to assume he is maliciously homophobic just cause OP says so. I'd like to have an example of him being insulting.\n\nYeah, nothing wrong with jokey blokes making blokey jokes, as long as jokes are jokes. There's usually a clear way to see if someone is homophobic or just made a wrong joke to the wrong audience. The telltale sign is them being homophobic.", "Well I am half judging by myself. I will make jokes like the one OP described. On the other hand, I have voted for gay rights in every referendum my country held, I don't stay quiet when my homophobic friends start saying stupid shit etc. I don't think this gives me the right to say gay jokes - but I don't think I am,homophobic, quite the opposite. And the jokes are just that - jokes!"]}
