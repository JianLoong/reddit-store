{"id": 13980, "submission_id": "12bnviv", "title": "AITA for making my nephew cry on his birthday party over some gifts?", "selftext": "My (f26) sister (f29) has a son Eric, he's eight years old. I don't visit a lot, we live away, but I see them (and most of my family) at birthdays and holidays. When I visit I usually buy Eric a toy or some candy, as he's my only nephew. Tbh I like to spoil him and maybe I am a little bit to blame for what happened too.\n\nIt was Eric's birthday this week. I visited them and I brought him a nice car toy, the car was quite big and had lights and stuff. When I got to the party I wished him a happy birthday and handed him the gift. He opened and he loved it, he said \"so far this is the best one\", which at the time I thought he was just excited but with what happened later I kinda get the idea it was more malicious intended.\n\nLike an hour or so after the party started, when everyone had already arrived, Eric made an announcement to the table in which the adults were sitting. He said that I have won and that I was now the person who he loved the most because my gift was the one he liked the most. I thought it was sweet that he liked it. Then he told to my mom that her gift sucked (she brought him a board game) so he didn't loved her anymore, he also told one of his friends that next year he won't be invited because his gift was poor (he gifted him a set of dinosaurs figures). \n\nI think this whole thing of ranking the gifts people got them was pretty shitty, I expected my sister or her husband to say something, but they didn't, they just laughed. So I told Eric that he's not supposed to say that about his gifts, people get them what they can and he should be grateful with it. He said that he doesn't understand why he has to love people who doesn't buy him nice gifts. I genuinely can't believe my sister is teaching this bullshit to her son. His dad told him \"yeah, they should give you all the best\"\n\nSo I then again told him that a person's worth is not about how expensive or big the gift they got him was, and that if he thought that way then I will not be continuing buying him gifts. Eric started to cry, my sister told me off because I made him cry but most of my family and some of her in laws were on my side and told them it was bad to teach their kid such thing. Our mom was quite affected and I wanted to leave too, so we left after that. My sister texted me later to call me an asshole for leaving before the candles were blow and for telling her child he won't get any more gifts from me, she said I shouldn't make empty threats to a child. I said that it's not empty and it's not a threat, its a promise until they teach their kids some manners. \n\nAm I wrong for discussing this when my nephew was present? Am l being unreasonable to him since he's young? And would I be wrong in the future if I keep my promise and do not buy him a gift the next time we see each other?", "created_utc": 1680624780, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bnviv/aita_for_making_my_nephew_cry_on_his_birthday/", "score": 1103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kid is exceptionally dickish.", "While I agree with your verdict, I disagree with this:\n\n>at 8, he should know *a little better*\n\nHe should know *a lot better* and the fact he\u2019s acting this way is \ud83d\udcaf on his parents for teaching it to him. I would have supported OP if she took her gift back and left. She showed restraint by not punishing him now (when he wasn\u2019t aware of the consequences) but informing him that unless his behavior changes in the future, not to expect any more gifts from her.", "Yeah if the kid was like 3-4 it could be passed off as being a young, ignorant kid not really knowing any better. But by 8? Damn you better know better. Huge parenting fail. Reinforced by laughing at it. I'd have been grounded for this whole thing let alone just telling grandma you don't love her any more.", "They\u2019re not even trying!", "It can be. Some parents would rather be their kids friends than be their parent. I guess his parents have a fear of making their child resent them for teaching them discipline.", "Lol I literally always give my niece and nephew a card and $20 for their bdays\u2026 you make it sound bad! Lol", "If my sister and BIL don't step up he'll be", "I couldn\u2019t decide between Veruca Salt or Dudley Dursley", "the nephew sounds like Eric cartman", "At school kids are taught about manners etc as well in wider society.

Maybe he liked the gift. Maybe he wasn't able to bring anything else, etc. He must have felt so bad when your nephew told him he wasn't invited anymore. But you speaking up went to your nephew but also to his friends. That kid in particular did hear you. NTA. You're setting a great example!", "Is your nephew Eric Cartman from South Park? There was literally an early episode where he kicks people out of his party and denies them cake for bringing bad presents.", "Your sister and her husband are raising a rude, hurtful, entitled bully. It's hard to believe they thought those words and actions were appropriate, whether to adults or children. I'm with you - no gifts in the future, for anyone in the family. You know exactly where he learned the behavior, and your response was perfect.", "You're definitely not the asshole, OP.\n\nIf you wanted to be an asshole you could've used his own logic and asked him what kind of amazing gifts he's been giving you and everyone else at the party to deserve all your love and attention? Can't imagine he's handing out light up cars to all his friends and family on an 8yo's budget.\n\n*That* would've been a dick move to a kid his age.\n\nWhat you said and did was entirely appropriate. His parents are doing him a huge disservice by letting him carry on talking to people like that, especially people who obviously care about him.\n\nI hope he takes what you said to heart.\n\nNTA.", "If sister isn't entirely obtuse, she may have laughed to keep her denial going that her son is in desperate need of therapy. And that there is something terribly wrong. But with that extreme lack of empathy, it may be beyond what therapy can help.\n\nI raised six kids, I have never seen anything close to that behavior with an 8 year old.", "Well, it was your sister the one who raised him so\u2026\nI guess he learned from her parents to behave this way.", "NTA. OP is your nephew Eric Cartman? Because that\u2019s a funny coincidence. Either way, you sister and brother in law, should be teaching him to be thankful for what he has and can\u2019t always get what he wants. If they\u2019re not doing it then at least you are.", "I remember two Christmases, \n\nOne year older brother woke me up at 1am. \nConvinced me to open a present as santa had been. \nBoth ended up opening everything. \nMy brother ate all the chocolate and was sick through dinner. \nThe following year, my brother woke me up, saying that we had nothing, crept downstairs nothing under the tree. Pure disappointment. \nWhen mum woke up, she said that Santa saw what we did the previous year and had left all gifts in mums room so that she could share in the excitement. \n\nNTA , in this OP but maybe skip a year and then following years reconsider the type of gifts you get him going forward! \n\nOP's sister is raising a brat. IMO", "If he keeps down this path give it a couple of years and he won\u2019t even have a friend to come to his parties.", ">Yeah the other kid was 7/8 too because he was one of his classmates.\n\n**whose mother probably bought the gift in the first place, so** ***your nephew not only hurt his classmate's feelings but also his classmate's mom's...***\n\nThat's not really a great look for your sister and BIL.", "I'm afraid he doesn't have any friends left", "And the time will come when every one of his classmates decline to attend his parties because you know this is going to be discussed at school.  Even second graders gossip.", "Yeah...this is cute behavior for a toddler that would need to be corrected. For an 8 year old, this behavior is way out of line, and even doubly for the parents. He should absolutely know better.", "That\u2019s where my brain went! Immediately gave me \u201clast year there were 37\u201d vibes.", "Thought the same. The entire Dursley family", ":( It's bad enough the OP's nephew was an AH to adults, but there's extra painful to me about the fact he shamed some other kid.", "I had similar. I grew up poor and gave a classmate a model painting kit that costed under \u00a310, because he was pretty good at art so I thought it was right up his street, another classmate got this tiny radio control car which apparently was more cool than a regular radio controlled car. When we were next in class I overheard him say to another kid that he wanted to leave my gift behind but didn't because I'd probably notice and get upset. As if I couldn't hear him sitting 10 feet away the other side of the classroom. Ungrateful and stupid pratt. This was when we were 8/9 year olds, and i'm mid 30s now.", "I agree, the kid doesn't deserve it. That way the aunt won't get invited to the next birthday anymore (what a pity).", "Better yet, give it to the kid whose gift he deemed \"poor.\"", "NTA I would be embarrassed, not laughing at my child for saying that he doesn't love grandma because the gift sucked. I love gifting people but if someone told me that I would never gift them anything ever again, especially at how the sister reacted, it seems like they only keep family close because of benefits. Not because they love them.", "If I were the kid's parent every present would be confiscated and given to charity and he'd be writing apology letters to everybody he was rude to. Other privileges would be gone too for the foreseeable future. And no I'm not a keyboard warrior but as a parent it's my job to raise a decent human being, what he did was completely unacceptable and I'd be nipping that in the bud straight off.\n\nThey say manners cost nothing but I'd make it the case that his manners cost him alot on this occasion.", "Same. Kid should\u2019ve be taught better before now. NTA OP.", "Agree. Even my kid with ADHD (who can be very blunt at times) knew enough at 5 to say thank you for gifts even if he didn't like them.", "Def NTA. I hope you remind that kid why he isn\u2019t getting gifts at every occasion, because his parents sure aren\u2019t going to provide a reality check.", "I\u2019m very glad you left with your mom, that must have been a wrenching moment for her.", "Hell, I\u2019m an adult and I\u2019d be thrilled to get a card and $20, that\u2019s a classic", "Not only that but it's good he saw it,  you know if op pulled the mom aside privately no message was ever going to get through to the kid because both parents suck, and actively promote the behavior. Maybe this way, the kid will think about what caused that to happen.", "Pretty sure it will get a lot worse than that. Sounds like the type of behavior that will justify anything.", "My nephew learnt that the hard way. \n\nHe was older than OP\u2019s (and I know his parents aren\u2019t teaching him that but kids will be kids sometimes), he wanted something quite expensive and I said no, he wouldn\u2019t give me more options and at some point said \u201cso don\u2019t get me anything, then\u201d. \n\nAnd I did just that.
