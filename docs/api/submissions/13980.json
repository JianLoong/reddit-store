{"id": 13980, "submission_id": "12bnviv", "title": "AITA for making my nephew cry on his birthday party over some gifts?", "selftext": "My (f26) sister (f29) has a son Eric, he's eight years old. I don't visit a lot, we live away, but I see them (and most of my family) at birthdays and holidays. When I visit I usually buy Eric a toy or some candy, as he's my only nephew. Tbh I like to spoil him and maybe I am a little bit to blame for what happened too.\n\nIt was Eric's birthday this week. I visited them and I brought him a nice car toy, the car was quite big and had lights and stuff. When I got to the party I wished him a happy birthday and handed him the gift. He opened and he loved it, he said \"so far this is the best one\", which at the time I thought he was just excited but with what happened later I kinda get the idea it was more malicious intended.\n\nLike an hour or so after the party started, when everyone had already arrived, Eric made an announcement to the table in which the adults were sitting. He said that I have won and that I was now the person who he loved the most because my gift was the one he liked the most. I thought it was sweet that he liked it. Then he told to my mom that her gift sucked (she brought him a board game) so he didn't loved her anymore, he also told one of his friends that next year he won't be invited because his gift was poor (he gifted him a set of dinosaurs figures). \n\nI think this whole thing of ranking the gifts people got them was pretty shitty, I expected my sister or her husband to say something, but they didn't, they just laughed. So I told Eric that he's not supposed to say that about his gifts, people get them what they can and he should be grateful with it. He said that he doesn't understand why he has to love people who doesn't buy him nice gifts. I genuinely can't believe my sister is teaching this bullshit to her son. His dad told him \"yeah, they should give you all the best\"\n\nSo I then again told him that a person's worth is not about how expensive or big the gift they got him was, and that if he thought that way then I will not be continuing buying him gifts. Eric started to cry, my sister told me off because I made him cry but most of my family and some of her in laws were on my side and told them it was bad to teach their kid such thing. Our mom was quite affected and I wanted to leave too, so we left after that. My sister texted me later to call me an asshole for leaving before the candles were blow and for telling her child he won't get any more gifts from me, she said I shouldn't make empty threats to a child. I said that it's not empty and it's not a threat, its a promise until they teach their kids some manners. \n\nAm I wrong for discussing this when my nephew was present? Am l being unreasonable to him since he's young? And would I be wrong in the future if I keep my promise and do not buy him a gift the next time we see each other?", "created_utc": 1680624780, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bnviv/aita_for_making_my_nephew_cry_on_his_birthday/", "score": 5607, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Our Chinese New Years traditions changed cause one of my cousin\u2019s kids did something similar. You are supposed to give relative\u2019s children \u2018red packets\u2019 with money for the new year. Kids are supposed to receive the packet, say their well wishes to the giver and put the packet away. This kid took the packet (my parents gave him) opened it up in front of everyone, pulled out the cash and counted it. Then complained that it was \u2018too little\u2019 (compared to one he got from his grandparents). I have never seen my cousin go so red, or the rest of my relatives go so silent. We went our separate ways after my cousin apologised profusely. From then on, through mutual agreement, red packet giving was limited to direct relatives (grandparents and parents) for that side of the family.\nKids can be assholes.\nParents carry much of the blame, and so can grandparent if they are spoiling their grandkids too much.", "A packet of underwear", "Yeah mismstched ones", "If I did that as a kid and made an announcement that I didn't love grandma anymore because she gave me a \"dumb\" gift my mom would have hauled me away by my ear because holy shit that was just a cruel thing to say.", "This", "Op is female\u2026", "It really doesn\u2019t matter how spoiled you are. You can be incredibly spoiled, but still be *grateful*.  There are plenty of kids out there who have been spoiled by family and friends who do not act like this. \n\nThis behavior is being enabled by your sister and his dad. They can choose not to correct it, and allow it to continue. But they don\u2019t get to ask you, or anyone else to deal with it.  He insulted everyone at his party, and his parents are basically telling everyone they have to accept it. That\u2019s not how the word works. \n\nActions have consequences. It\u2019s simple really. Teach your kid manners, and to be thankful/grateful for anything he is given - or else he won\u2019t get anything. Putting your foot down now, will be a hell of a lot easier than when he is an adult and demanding that you pay for his college/wedding/apartment/whatever.", "This. OP, I have kids around this age, and I would know I failed as a parent if they acted like this.", "My kid is not 4 years old yet and we\u2019ve already made sure he knows he has to show gratitude for gifts even if he doesn\u2019t really like them. 8 years old is past old enough to know better. Of course it\u2019s not his fault.. this isn\u2019t knowledge you\u2019re born with, these are values his parents should have taught him.", "At 8 he should have an understanding of other peoples feelings and basic gift etiquette.  Sis is failing her kid and someone needed to call him out.  If my son acted like this I would have been ashamed and horrified personally", "This was my first thought!", "Yes, it really is, and what he said to his GRANDMOTHER. He would be not having a party anymore if that were my son; he'd be in another room until he apologized to EVERYONE. Your sister and her husband behaved infathomably to me.", "NTA, but YTA for leaving before they blew the candles out.  It\u2019s just a fucking kid and his birthday.  Get over yourself\u2026", "My sister did something similar when we were growing up. An older nephew bought her a nice stuffed animal. They were not well off. She said she hated it and pouted. Crushed my nephew, my mother was indeed mortified.\n\n\nWe were on vacation and visiting along the way to other destinations. Mom grounded her while on vacation lol. All the tedious road trip travel, none of the fun for a whole week. Why? My sister never apologized directly, very stubborn.", "Fuck that. So sorry this happened. Stuff like this somehow hurts forever \n\nQuick story, not about gifts, but to make another point: my \"best friend\" called me a teacher's pet when we were 8 - I wasn't at all, but I was good at school, as was she, ironically. She said it this one time only. I'm 41 and still vividly remember how I came home in tears, and am also aware how this caused a life-long pattern of downplaying myself and selling myself as less than I am. So we may think \"it's just words\" or \"they're just kids being kids\" or \"a couple of words from some kid won't matter\" - sometimes they do matter.", "I would have asked for it back \ud83d\ude0f.\nI was short fused. Still am but I breathe before I react now", "This is so cute, kid gets to play pretend Christmas and learn about gratitude at the same time. \ud83e\udd70", "Yellow mega man.", ">There are plenty of kids out there who have been spoiled by family and friends who do not act like this.    \n>  \n>This behavior is being enabled by your sister and his dad.\n\nThis.  My kids are very spoiled, to the point that I have had to call them out on some pretty entitled/ungrateful behavior in the past.  If they ever pulled a stunt half this bad, they wouldn't need to worry about anyone bringing \"bad\" birthday presents to their birthday party for at least a year or two.", "I disagree. At 8, he should know a whole lot better. I cannot imagine my 8 year old or any of her 8 year old friends doing this. Hell I couldn\u2019t imagine my 6 year olds or even their rattiest friends doing this.", "I am 29 and still pretend I don\u2019t see money in cards when I open them because my mom would have been mortified if had started counting it out right there. Your nephew is being set up for a lonely future when all he attracts are superficial people with the same attitude if the behavior isn\u2019t corrected. Definitely NTA", "So many parents today say the line \"he's just a kid he doesn't know any better\" as if that's a reason not to teach him to know better. \n\nAs a parent your job is to teach these harder lessons so we don't end up with a bunch of adults that don't know any better.\n\nHe didn't know any better? He does now.", "An 8 year old didn't learn this on his own. She laughed because she's the one who probably taught him to act this way.", "You should probably stop buying that family unit gifts, not just the child.", "I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the school gets wind of it and invites your sister for a sit down. Something like that is bullying and could be something the school might want to nip in the bud before it becomes an issue.", "Really feel bad for the one who gave him the dinosaur figures. That was really hurtful. Nice gift for that age too.", "NTA. And I know this is tricky but your family and inlaws need to get together and give the parents a reality check or else the kid will suffer and it wont really br his fault, that's what he was taught. It is not cute or funny, he isn't 2 and he is being so rude and hurtful and walking towards not being good natured. You van only do your part, like you did, by giving the reality check to the kid, hopefully others will join you. That comment to the other kid going unchecked is unbeliavable. But I really think it starts with those parents. Id be encouraging everyone on your side to stop gift giving until he wakes up."]}
