Note that she was the one who broke up with him and she was also the one who started dating someone new first. \n\nNow on to the sister of the ex. I was friends with his ex\u2019s sister before I had even met him (but not the ex). We weren\u2019t best friends but we were close enough that we would see each other in group settings regularly and catch up one on one occasionally. \n\nBefore me and my husband dated, this friend? never ever once mentioned her sister to me, ever. I only knew she had a sister from another mutual friend who knew her. Now, as soon as I told her me and my husband was dating she started bringing her sister into every small thing even though I did not ask.\n\nExamples:\n\nI showed her my new car and she decided she needed to tell me her sister recently bought a Prius. \n\nWhen I shared with her the financial struggles of the job I was in she responded with \u201cmy sister makes so much money she doesn\u2019t even know what to do with it\u201d. \n\nWhen I invited her into my home and we were talking about house decor, she decided she needed to bring up about how her sister only wants fabulous things in her home. \n\nIt\u2019s just every little thing is brought back to her sister which I find extremely odd because before I told her me and my husband were dating she never once mentioned she even had a sister. \n\nConsidering this friend\u2019s real sus change in behaviour and how horrible her sister has been towards my husband post breakup I did not want her to be at the wedding because I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying behind our back and I don\u2019t want anyone at our wedding that says bad things about my husband or makes him uncomfortable - it\u2019s just not necessary. \n\nSo I confronted her about the change in behaviour I had noticed and also about her sister talking $h*t behind our back. She then started crying, saying how she didn\u2019t even realise she\u2019s been bringing her sister up and felt like this was between me and her sister. But there was a lot of crying and so not a lot was clarified in that conversation.\n\nI struggle believing her in all honesty because there\u2019s just too much \u201ccoincidences\u201d and from what I know about her family it just makes her intentions real sus and I don\u2019t even know if she was ever a real friend from the start. \n\nI left the ball in her court because I\u2019m honestly getting to old for this stuff that if she wants to reach out she can, but if not that is okay too.

I would not invite her.  There's no way she didn't know / only inadvertently brought her sister up after she knew you were dating her ex.  She's only crying because she got called out.", "NTA. It's your wedding. Do what you think will be least likely to cause drama or make it a less fun day for you and your husband. \n\nBut just be prepared if you have the same group of friends that not inviting her could cause a rift in the group and some people might get upset at you about it.", "INFO: Are you already married, you refer to your partner as your husband but you speak about the wedding as if it is coming up.  Does your husband have children with the ex?  If not, why do you care if she is still talking smack about your husband?", "Nta. \n\nShe brought bad vibes. \n\nIts your wedding. If you think someone is going to bring negative energy is your choice to invite and kick out who is able to gl to YOUR wedding.", "NTA for cutting her from the guest list but not so sure why you care so much about them talking about you. It all sounds very 8th grade.", "NTA, and I think you are making a big deal out of something that does not have to be a big deal.\n\nShe seems like more of a casual acquaintance than a good friend, so you can easily put some distance between the two of you going forward, and you don't have to invite her to the wedding. \n\n**If you invite her to the wedding, you can be sure she will be taking photos and video and reporting back to her sister with snarky comments.**", "NTA\n\nShe was being disrespectful and she knew what she was doing. Good for you being a mature person. Congrats on your marriage, and cheers to a long healthy relationship!", "My gut feeling here is ESH. \n\nI'm guessing the sister has been badgering your friend to say nice things about her and that's why she wound up talking about her a lot. \n\nBut I don't think your friend sounds like the type to be manipulative on purpose. You say you knew her before you dated your husband, so why be so paranoid about her motivations in being your friend? Sounds to me like the thing you have in common with your husband's ex is a penchant for making drama. Sorry, calling it like I see it, here. \n\nDefinitely uninvite the ex, though. You don't need any *more* drama llamas at your wedding.", "NTA.  Drop her like a hot potato. Her crying was most likely to mask her surprise at getting found out and called.  Sounds highly likely she wanted to go just to take notes and potentially cause continued drama.  Move on with your lives and leave this person and their sister in the past.", "NTA - this is perfectly reasonable. If you already invited her it's awkward but still probably not the worst solution. Imagine the tin-can telephone story your wedding would end up being to people you don't even know because the ex clearly can't let go of a guy she chose to let go of....", "Too late for vote to count but NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou smell something off about her, don't freaking invite her unless you're falling short of crazy and need to make your quota.", "Doesn\u2019t seem like the ex has anything to do with his situation. Why does it matter that the ex broke up with your husband first and then dated someone new first? If anything, these things, along with him being hurt by her comments, suggest that he\u2019s not over yet.", "YTA. This really sounds like you\u2019re over-sensitive to stuff about her sister, and it sounds like it\u2019s between your partner and her sister. \n\nYou\u2019re right - you\u2019re too old for this drama stuff.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
