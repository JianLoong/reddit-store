I have only met Mary a few times in get togethers, so right off the bat I felt a little uncomfortable since I wanted this to be a close friend\u2019s trip and I\u2019m also a pretty shy and nervous person around new people. Sally insisted on letting Mary come, because \u201cthe more the merrier\u201d and we can use this as an opportunity to \u201cget to know her.\u201d Reluctantly, Tina and I agreed and let her come. \n\nA week later we drove up to the ski place, and we are all amazed by the snow and excited. Except Mary. Mary was full aware this was a ski trip because we told her several times. The rest of the day she kept whining about how cold it was, and how she didn\u2019t even know how to ski.

When I looked, She was shit talking about me to her boyfriend and this entire trip, and how i am a cheap woman and probably used all my life savings for this tacky trip. I was super hurt because I didn\u2019t expect her to say all that. I told Tina and Sally and they were shocked too. So after that I just acted normal around Mary, as if nothing happened. \n\nSo for dinner, I told Tina and Sally that we will be dining out, but i didn\u2019t tell mary. I told my friends that we are eating at a fancy restaurant and i didn\u2019t invite Mary because I was mad at her. Sally and Tina got super mad at me and called me an AH and said i was overreacting. since then, the trip was awkward with everyone  and i haven\u2019t really spoken to anyone since then.

You need better friends. I would've been mad too if a person who basically invited themselves on a trip that I was funding, said that about me. Mary sucks but the bigger question is why aren't Sally and Tina sticking up for you?", "nta. \n\nhonestly you need better friends. mary is a major AH for obvious but so are tina and sally. if they think you\u2019re such an AH a they should also pay for their own trip and fck off. you were not overreacting AT ALL.", "NTA at all\n\nSo you planned a trip with your close friends, Mary who is barely more then a stranger barged into the middle of it, pressure you both directly and through your friend to come. Then despite knowing what type of trip it is whined about it ruining your experience and was simultaneously  insulting you as a person and your wealth. She is snobby, unimaginably narcissistic and incredibly rude. Avoid her at all costs and have a frank conversation with your friends about their behaviour because you in no way overreacted and they shouldn\u2019t have allowed Mary on the trip much less get mad at you.", "NAH - Are you sure Tina and Sally are your friends?? Now, while you shouldn't have looked at Mary's phone, this trip was a powder keg from the start. Considering how Tina and Sally thought you were overreacting when you revealed Mary was talking shit, they were probably talking shit about you too. The thing that I find crazy is that Mary sent you nasty text messages. OK. I get it, you were looking at her phone, but she was also talking shit! Mary sounds absolutely delightful. Anyways...\n\nI hope this was an isolated issue or some bad juju going on because if it isn't, these two women are not your friends.", "NTA. You've gone out of your way to accommodate her (LITERALLY!) and she's done nothing but try and ruin your trip. Sally and Tina are welcome to pay for the rest of Mary's trip if they want her to come along, but you're done. You don't deserve that kind of disrespect.", "ESH\n\nYou already said that you should not have snooped on her phone. that one is on you. But that does not change the fact that Mary is a bad friend and overall bad person to go on a trip anyway. Once you found out you should have talked directly to her about it.", "ESH. Mary was in the wrong for being so negative about a trip she'd begged to go on, but your \"revenge\" was pointless and just made things worse. You should have confronted her directly.\n\nAlso, Mary needs a lock screen on her phone.", "NtA. \n\nTime for new friends. And always split the cost of everything!  Limits the whining people feel entitled to, because they also choose something within their budget.", "ESH\n\nThere's a lot of value in being clear and direct. \n\nYou and your buddies should have found a way to tell Mary that she wasn't invited and wouldn't be coming on the ski trip - it sounds like in the end everybody would have been happier had that happened.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn't want her to go, you were paying, you should have said no. You also shouldn't have gone through her phone, didn't matter how she was being or what she said, wasnt yours to go through.  You can't agree to let people walk all over you then complain that they're doing so...\n\nIf it makes you feel better the rest of them are totally ah too", "NTA\n\nNo, \"Not the more the merrier\" the more the messier!!\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have let this happen to beggin with... I would've taken photos of her messages and canceled her room... less of a hit on my life savings.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOU are the AH. YOu decided to let her come with you, and then behaved like an AH.", "NTA, however, I was with you up until you ditched a person on your trip and sunk to her level.\n\nYou\u2019ve learnt your lesson, go with your gut, don\u2019t invite her again.", "ESH\nStop paying for other people. Learn to say \"no\" when asked to go outside your comfort zone. Taking turns paying travel expenses for a close knit group changes when others, outside of that group, are suddenly introduced. You were willing to pay for the three of you, as your 2 friends have been reciprocating in kind. Why would you let Mary inject herself at your expense?\n\nIt's a shame you aren't comfortable holding boundaries around who you spend time with and hiw you spend your money. I hope this experience motivates you to learn about healthy boundaries in ALL relationships.", "NTA but both Mary and Sally are assholes. Since you're paying for everything she shouldn't have insisted on bringing Mary. She should have paid for her at least.", "NTA\n\nAll of this could have been avoided if you had just said no in the first place. \n\nSo many people are caught up trying to be \u201cnice\u201d that you forget you don\u2019t actually owe anyone anything.", "First, that\u2019s a weird way to do trips. One person pays for everything and the rest only covers expenses sounds like a sure fire way for people to take advantage. Second, you paid for the trip. You have the right to say no to extra people. You don\u2019t owe an explanation but you could easily say it\u2019s paid up and you can\u2019t add an extra person. Third, Mary is not a part of the rotation. So unless she\u2019s planning the next trip and you\u2019re invited, she shouldn\u2019t have gone.

Since you were paying for this trip, you should have said NO.  Sally could invite her on trip that she's paying for.\n\nMary is clearly the A-H for everything, inviting herself on a trip she's not paying for, complaining about the cold for a SKI vacation, complaining about the quality of stay. etc\n\nHowever, Sally is equally responsible, for this fiasco, she insisted that Mary come(and was likely the one who told Mary about it initially).  \n\nI'd present Mary with a bill for her share(don't expect it to be paid).  \n\nI don't know how recoverable the relationship is with Tina and Sally, but I'd refuse to have more of a \"friendship\" with Mary.  She's a user and a nasty one because she can't even show gratitude.", "NTA. \n\nBut I would drop these friends fast, but I'm also petty enough that I would wait until after they next two vacations where they each pay, and then I'd drop them.", "I\u2019m petty enough to go on the next two trips, paid for by the others. Mary gets a free holiday (why?) and complains?", "I wonder if the friends really paid for any of the trips. They seemed too entitled to her money... They already \"found out\" how Mary talked about her and yet called her an Ah because she doesn't want to be a doormat...OP, you need real friends. NTA"]}
