I get along with her well, except for this one point: if you don't keep an eye on her, she will get into the kitchen, and add seasonings to whatever is cooking. She thinks she is fixing stuff, but not all foods need turmeric in it.\n\nThis saturday, I received 40lbs of tomatoes, it took me the whole weekend to turn it into a sauce that I was planning to can. I can it plain, then add whatever seasonings and herbs it needs, depending on the recipe.\n\nThey came to take a bag of spare clothes for one of their kids, and in the 5 minutes it took me to get it, she managed to get into the kitchen, add salt, pepper, turmeric, olive oil, garlic powder and italian herbs to all 5 of the pots that were simmering on the stove.\n\nAnd when I told asked her what she was doing, she had the audacity to say \"this sauce needed some taste, I added it for you\". Like I've never told her to not touch what I was cooking before.\n\nI was so angry that I knew I couldn't be calm talking with her. So I simply walked to my brother, told him to take the clothes and his wife, and that she is no longer welcome in my house.\n\nShe had followed me, was shocked, started apologizing, but I just ignored her. I added that he should come by tomorrow to take the sauce his wife ruined, because otherwise it would be thrown away, and that I expected 40lbs of replacement tomatoes.\n\nThey left, he came back with the tomatoes, an apology letter from her, and an apology carrot cake (my fav). But I told him that I stand by my decision.\n\nNow my parents got involved, since I am the one that usually hosts, and since she is not allowed in my house, I told them to make alternate plans for Memorial day.\n\nMy husband says that I am in the right, but my parents say that my reaction is way overblown. So AITA?\n\nEdit: since there seems to be some confusion, I am not planning to host for memorial day and bot invite her, I said I am not hosting, my parents or my brother should host, and I will attend as a guest.

She's crossing boundaries, poking into something where she doesn't belong. There's all kinds of wrong with messing with someone else's cooking - what if you were making something for someone allergic to turmeric?\n\nGood on your brother for replacing the tomatoes, and on her for apologizing. That said, you're still in the right for banning her from the house, especially if that has happened multiple times *and you have been clear with her that it's not acceptable*.\n\nIf you are thinking about letting her back in, I'd make sure the apology is a real apology first. Not \"I'm sorry if your feelings were hurt\", but something which takes responsibility for her actions. \"I added seasoning to your giant tomato sauce project without asking; this was out of line and I shouldn't have done it. It's my fault, and I'm sorry.

A cake is a nice gesture but by no means is it enough to buy your trust back.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly entitled and selfish to walk into someone else\u2019s kitchen, tamper with their food, and then *insult them and their ability to cook* by claiming to have \u201cmade the food better.\u201d This feels like it\u2019s the first time your SIL has truly faced the consequences of her meddling. Maybe she\u2019ll learn her lesson and stop touching other people\u2019s things.", "As someone who made canned tomato sauce from just 20lbs of tomatoes, it takes forever and is a lot of hard work to get it to the simmer on the stove phase. Maybe you have an electric food mill, but I didn't and it got old and tiring to mill those tomatoes. You should have given her an invoice for your time. NTA\n\nI disagree with her \"learning her lesson.\" She obviously has been asked multiple times to stop doing it, and she just continues to ignore boundaries and exert her control. NOPE.", "NTA  \n\n\nHer complete lack of respect in not respecting your boundaries is only exceeded by her inability to understand why you never so much as touch somebody else's craft or art without their permission, let alone start changing it  \n\n\nIf it was me, she'd never be coming back into my house. I wouldn't care how many apologies I got from her because from my POV I'd figure the only thing she's sorry for is her behaviour causing a scene.

The audacity of SIL.\n\nAs for the suggestions that you let her back in since it sounds like she learned her lesson, that's up to you. But if you choose to let her back, might take it slow, and see how she behaves. Have some low-value stuff on the stove and see what she does with it. If she repeats - she's banned.       Alternatively, she's banned now and has to earn your trust and forgiveness before she's allowed back in.", "NTA. It's your home and you have the right to decide who is and isn't welcome. Your sil has displayed on numerous occasions that she doesn't respect boundaries. This event was just the 40lb straw that broke the camel'a back.\n\nI'm glad they gave you new tomatoes and that she wrote you an apology letter with an apology cake. I also hope she will invite you out to apologize in person. However, I think that you should stick to your guns for memorial day. It's easy for people to write pretty things on paper.

Canning is a pain in the butt and you need to follow a recipe to make it safe for canning. Adding random spices and OIL???  I would have been livid. And if those had been my home grown tomatoes that might be an unforgivable offense.  40lbs of replacement tomatoes doesn't make up for the time blanching, peeling, seeding, and cooking down to a sauce consistency. \n\nI also can plain sauce and then add to it when I open it to make a meal.", "NTA, I\u2019d be absolutely fuming if I had to repeatedly tell someone not to tamper with my food.

While I do agree they seem to have apologized, it doesn\u2019t make up for the past occurrences.", "NTA.  \n\nIf you decide to allow her  back, get baby gates for your kitchen, put signs on the gates with a picture of your SIL in a red circle with a line drawn through her and put them up when she visits.  This is probably too much, but I'd love to see her face when she sees it.\n\nETA \n\nIf you allow her back buy a hidden nanny cam for your kitchen so, when she inevitably can't help herself, you'll have proof to send your family when they berate you for making the ban permanent.\n\nShe's also doing this with no idea if anyone has any allergies or sensitivities to whatever she decides to add.

This isn\u2019t just changing the flavor of a recipe, but making it unsafe to can after hours and hours of labor. It\u2019s disrespectful and wasted your time and money.

SIL is obnoxious.", "My sister's BIL, a chef, would do this all the time.  One big problem was he would always add wine, and we had some recovering Scooba who then wouldn't touch it.   He did this many times even after being asked to stop.  He'd say no problem, the alcohol burns off.  But it wasn't up to him at all. \n\nI'd let your SIL host events for awhile. Let her cook and do the work.  Your parents are wrong and should support you.  \n\n She needs to learn no means no and to keep her nose out of your kitchen.  \n\nI'd be so angry.... particularly b after all the work you did.  \n\nNTA to put it mikdly", "NTA.

At this time, I am not willing to open my home to a person who has consistently abused their guest privileges despite repeated requests, discussions, and warnings to stop. Others can take a turn hosting or we can meet somewhere for family events. My home, and my kitchen, are closed until further notice.\u201d \n\nIf they push back because of the apology, you can let them know it takes time and consistently trustworthy behavior to repair damaged trust. You\u2019re glad she finally understands her behavior was wrong and damaging\u2014it\u2019s unfortunate it took a ban for her to apologize, but that\u2019s something only she can explain. Given that she didn\u2019t even apologize until she faced a serious penalty, it\u2019s reasonable to need time and evidence that she\u2019s changed before you grant her guest privileges again.

She can host now.", "Getting more tomatoes and a carrot cake and an apology is all very nice, but this wasn't a one shot thing and honestly, nobody should have to be told not to mess with someone else's cooking. Ever. Much less repeatedly.   \nShe walked in and saw the amount of labor that 40 lbs of tomatoes took, and decided she could spend 5 minutes and make it \"better\".   \nThat apology? I'm willing to bet it was an \"I'm sorry you're mad at me, can it all be okay now?\" type apology rather than actually acknowledging the harm done and the extra labor OP has to do now.   \nA carrot cake??? Naw. I've made carrot cakes. I've done big canning prep, cooking and canning projects.   \nThe carrot cake is a lot less effort. It's extortion to demand forgiveness from the person harmed. Delicious extortion, but it's not an apology.   \n\n\nAs far as OP's parents go, they need to back off too. OP is not obligated to host anything or anyone in her home and certainly not someone who has disregarded her boundaries that way.   \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Just out of curiosity, did her apology letter indicate that she understands why she was wrong? \n\nHer repeated refusal to let you decide what ingredients to add to your cooking isn't about being eager to help. It's about a fundamental lack of respect for you and your boundaries. She doesn't respect the fact that it's your kitchen, your food, and your decision how to season it. She thinks she knows better and that you should be thankful to her for \"improving\" your cooking. \n\nIf you're going to forgive her and allow her to come back, she needs to prove to you that she fully understands why her actions were so disrespectful. She then needs to prove that she is capable of changing her behavior and treating you with respect going forward. She needs to promise that she will never set foot in your kitchen uninvited again and keep that promise. \n\nCongratulations on not ripping her face off.", "NTA, your parents can't stand her in their house either, eh? Why can't bro and SIL host? Would be fitting. Then you can ruin her cooking instead.", "NTA.

I love my MIL but her cooking is a little lacking in the spice department for MY tastes. Do you know what I do? I keep a bottle of cayenne pepper at her house in case I want to jazz MY plate up a little. Sometimes I even eat the bland (to me) food because it\u2019s polite and just not that big of a deal.

I'm hacked off for you, OP.\n\nNTA.\n\nETA. I'm super pissed that it was to tomato sauce. You don't add turmeric to tomato sauce that you use for pasta. Fucking ew (Italian family member says it would be thrown out). And turmeric acts as a blood thinner (my dad can't eat it at all for this reason).

However,  she seems more clueless than malicious. Your brother got you more tomatoes and you did get a carrot cake and apology letter from your SIL.

I get along with her well, except for this one point: if you don't keep an eye on her, she will get into the kitchen, and add seasonings to whatever is cooking. She thinks she is fixing stuff, but not all foods need turmeric in it.\n\nThis saturday, I received 40lbs of tomatoes, it took me the whole weekend to turn it into a sauce that I was planning to can. I can it plain, then add whatever seasonings and herbs it needs, depending on the recipe.\n\nThey came to take a bag of spare clothes for one of their kids, and in the 5 minutes it took me to get it, she managed to get into the kitchen, add salt, pepper, turmeric, olive oil, garlic powder and italian herbs to all 5 of the pots that were simmering on the stove.\n\nAnd when I told asked her what she was doing, she had the audacity to say \"this sauce needed some taste, I added it for you\". Like I've never told her to not touch what I was cooking before.\n\nI was so angry that I knew I couldn't be calm talking with her. So I simply walked to my brother, told him to take the clothes and his wife, and that she is no longer welcome in my house.\n\nShe had followed me, was shocked, started apologizing, but I just ignored her. I added that he should come by tomorrow to take the sauce his wife ruined, because otherwise it would be thrown away, and that I expected 40lbs of replacement tomatoes.\n\nThey left, he came back with the tomatoes, an apology letter from her, and an apology carrot cake (my fav). But I told him that I stand by my decision.\n\nNow my parents got involved, since I am the one that usually hosts, and since she is not allowed in my house, I told them to make alternate plans for Memorial day.\n\nMy husband says that I am in the right, but my parents say that my reaction is way overblown. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You not only got a (imagine sincere) apology but a hand written apology letter? Hard to say without knowing your relationship with SIL more but are you planning on maintaining this embargo forever? Is this beyond forgiveness? \n\nIt\u2019s possible this was the shock she needed. Also possible she does it again but seems worth a \u201csecond\u201d chance to me in order to keep the peace.", "So NTA.  Who goes into another person's  house and does that to whatever they are making.  She is being extremely rude doing this.  Sounds like it's time for your brother to start hosting. His wife obviously feels like she knows how to cook better than anyone else, so time to put her money where her mouth is.", "NTA. She\u2019d been warned, she ignored. Good you got your 40# of tomatoes back, but how can you trust her again? Excluding her from your house and stopping hosting for the family is the most compassionate way to make sure this never happens again.", "NTA, that is extremely shitty when she already knew you didn\u2019t want that. \n\nTo me she seems contrite though and did replace the wasted goods. I think you have to ruminate on what you want here. If she\u2019s truly sorry and pledges not to do it again are you going to hold a grudge forever?", "NTA and you even changed being the hose because you still want her to be a part of the family just not in your house.

She is completely out of line and shouldn't have *ever* needed to be told not to touch someone else's food.

I can't believe she did that.", "NTA\n\nWhen will people learn to stop messing with other people\u2019s food? At best it\u2019s rude, at worst it\u2019s dangerous.

I might let her back in a year or so.", "NTA.", "My mother and I will sometimes add a seasoning to each others dishes and it has caused small flare ups occasionally. Usually, the result is a good one and appreciated by both of us.

I secretly am sad that the dish could taste better (to me) but at the end of the day, it\u2019s to be shared. If someone says don\u2019t add stuff, you don\u2019t add stuff. It\u2019s that simple. I can always tweak my own plate. NTA. Actions have consequences and boundaries are there for a reason. Also, canning is a lot of work. I would\u2019ve been so upset.", "NTA but maybe put her on a probationary period as in not allowed in your house for say 6 months and than a trial period where she's told that she can come back when appropriate so long as she never tries to intervene in your food again and if she does she's back to being banned for good.

Such things as the temp, time, and pressure would need to be modified; they may also have a shorter shelf-life and be more prone to spoiling. This is why people usually preserve the most simple elements to give the most comprehensive range possible of uses and time VS more complex recipes that may be less diverse or utilitarian.\n\nP.S.

I would declare nuclear war on that hussy.", "Oil changes the properties and can go rancid or make the food spoil faster, and it can be a medium to grow bacteria.\n\nI saw some commenters were confused because it's common to see food preserved in oil or under fat (like potted meat or sun-dried tomatoes); in those cases, the food is kept under a layer of oil/fat which acts as an occlusive that keeps the harmful bacteria from getting in like a lid protecting it from the outside. \n\nIn those cases, it acts more like a pickling liquid; food above the surface will rot and attract mould, and pickling weights are often used to prevent anything from floating while it ferments. \n\nIn canning, the heat and pressure kill the bacteria and the jar/can is the occlusive barrier that creates a seal against the elements. That's why canned goods are fine on the shelf until they're opened; they must be consumed quickly and are best kept in a fridge. \ud83d\udc4c\n\n\ud83c\udf08\u2b50\ufe0f The more ya know! \ud83d\ude02", "I know someone allergic to garlic.
