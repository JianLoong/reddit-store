The other day, I found out that my cousin, Jane (43F), is getting a divorce. She, her parents (M&F, late 60s), and her brother, Dan (35M), also live in my hometown. Since Dan and I basically grew up together, I've always been close to their family.\n\nJane married her soon to be ex-husband, Ben (46M), about 12 years ago. At the time, Ben had a son, Max (now 15M), from a previous marriage. Max's mom is a bit of a disaster. Although Ben and his ex-wife technically share custody of Max, he has spent the majority of the last 12 years living with has dad and Jane. Max's mom has been remarried and divorced several times since she separated from Ben,  leaving Max with two half siblings who take up the majority of her time and attention. \n\nBecause of this, Max is extremely close to our family. Jane basically raised him and loves him like her own. Although Max does not call Jane \"mom,\" he refers to Dan as his \"uncle\" and calls Jane's parents by ethnic terms of endearment meaning \"grandma\" and \"grandpa.\" Jane's parents and Dan likewise adore Max. Dan is not married and Jane has no biological children, making Max their only \"grandchild.\" He even refers to me as \"Cousin Alkibiades\" and does the same thing with my siblings, nieces, and nephews.  \n\nDan called earlier this afternoon, asking me to come over after dinner and \"give advice\" to Jane. Although I am an attorney, I told Dan that I don't practice family law - nor am I licensed in their state. Thus, I wasn't sure how much help I could be. Dan said that didn't matter and insisted that Jane would just want me there for \"emotional support.\" At some point, we all ended up around the kitchen table commiserating with Jane. She said she wasn't interested in Ben's money. The only thing she wanted out of the marriage was to \"keep Max in \\[her\\] life.\"\n\nI must've made a face. Jane immediately turned to me and asked if that would be a problem. I told her best not to worry about it now, but she demanded that I say what I was thinking. I said, \"Max is underage and you have no legal relationship with him. You never adopted him. Both of his biological parents are alive and share custody as per a prior divorce agreement. He can do what he wants when he turns 18, but until then - I don't think you have any basis to demand shared custody or visitation rights.\"\n\nJane teared up and left the room. When she was out of earshot, Dan, my aunt, and my uncle immediately began telling me was a jerk for upsetting her. I said she was the one who insisted that I tell everyone what I was thinking, and advised that they start preparing for this outcome now.

You spoke the truth.", "NTA, she needed to hear it to save her from wasting money trying to get something that she's never going to get.

They all go to the same high school, so it would be weird if they were suddenly forbidden from associating with each other outside of school. \n\nAlso, on a more practical note - my oldest nephew has a car and driver's license and will often drive Max and his brother home from school and sports practice. If Max was suddenly forbidden from seeing anyone in our family, it would be a massive inconvenience for Ben and his ex-wife.", "Sigh ... I'm afraid so. This is why I don't practice family law - money is easy, lives and families are fragile.", "Thank you for saying this - there have been many times over the years when we've all wished that Max was Jane's biological son. \n\nHowever, as my older brother said, \"The problem with Jane's situation is that she has no permanent connection with Max. If Ben died, or if Jane and Ben got divorced, none of us would ever see Max again.\"\n\nI guess we're about to find out.", "I sympathize with this - but what's the \"softer way\" to tell a beloved relative that she has no legal claim to the child she's raised for over a decade? It's an overall terrible situation.", "My knowledge of family law is limited to single course I took in law school - now more than a decade ago. I made that abundantly clear. \n\nI also said that Max, being a teenager, could express his own wishes to the court. Even still, I urged Jane and her family to talk to a family law attorney licensed in their state.", "I would take the angle of (when asked \"will this be a problem\"),  \"Its really going to depend on how contentious this is going to be.  So, bare facts here, There isn't really anything you can do legally\" - which you have explained - \" BUT, you should   talk to Ben and impress upon him that you consider Max is still part of your family, and that you still want to be able to be inviting him to family things, want to show up at his school events, and like that.   You are a better judge than me of how amenable Ben will be for something like that.   Again, this isn't anything that can be a part of a divorce decree, but you can try and have a sort of 'gentlemens agreement'. \"   and then add something like \"Also, its not going to hurt to talk to your attorney about this.  I suspect that they will say the same thing, but you never know.  \" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMAybe that would have had the same result.  But its at least a little softer.", "I'm afraid the divorce will be a contentious affair. Ben isn't in a good place right now and thinks Jane is cheating on him. I know for a fact that Jane isn't cheating - our family is very traditional, and if Jane were cheating she would be disowned and Ben and Max would be welcomed with open arms. \n\nSo, unless Ben can see the light, I'm not sure there's going to be any concessions from him. I have urged Jane to see a family law attorney in this state.", "Info: why does Ben think Jane is cheating on him? Did someone present him with alleged evidence or what?", "No, nothing like that (at least as far as I'm aware). Ben has experienced several traumatic events over the last year, which have affected his mental health. I think the allegations of cheating are based more in his own insecurities rather than actual fact.\n\nOnce again, I'm not saying this just because Jane is my cousin. I and the rest of my family take a very dim view of cheating and would not hesitate to cut Jane loose if theses allegations were credible.", "I see, thanks for clearing that up for me. I didn't want to make it seem as if I don't take your word for it or trust your judgement of Jane's character (I do), but I was curious what led Ben to think his wife was having an affair and whether someone wanted him to believe that."]}
