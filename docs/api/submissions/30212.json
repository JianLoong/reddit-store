If Max was suddenly forbidden from seeing anyone in our family, it would be a massive inconvenience for Ben and his ex-wife.", "Sigh ... I'm afraid so. This is why I don't practice family law - money is easy, lives and families are fragile.", "Thank you for saying this - there have been many times over the years when we've all wished that Max was Jane's biological son. \n\nHowever, as my older brother said, \"The problem with Jane's situation is that she has no permanent connection with Max. If Ben died, or if Jane and Ben got divorced, none of us would ever see Max again.\"\n\nI guess we're about to find out.", "I sympathize with this - but what's the \"softer way\" to tell a beloved relative that she has no legal claim to the child she's raised for over a decade? It's an overall terrible situation.", "My knowledge of family law is limited to single course I took in law school - now more than a decade ago. I made that abundantly clear. \n\nI also said that Max, being a teenager, could express his own wishes to the court. Even still, I urged Jane and her family to talk to a family law attorney licensed in their state.", "I would take the angle of (when asked \"will this be a problem\"),  \"Its really going to depend on how contentious this is going to be.  So, bare facts here, There isn't really anything you can do legally\" - which you have explained - \" BUT, you should   talk to Ben and impress upon him that you consider Max is still part of your family, and that you still want to be able to be inviting him to family things, want to show up at his school events, and like that.   You are a better judge than me of how amenable Ben will be for something like that.   Again, this isn't anything that can be a part of a divorce decree, but you can try and have a sort of 'gentlemens agreement'. \"   and then add something like \"Also, its not going to hurt to talk to your attorney about this.  I suspect that they will say the same thing, but you never know.  \" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMAybe that would have had the same result.  But its at least a little softer.", "I'm afraid the divorce will be a contentious affair. Ben isn't in a good place right now and thinks Jane is cheating on him. I know for a fact that Jane isn't cheating - our family is very traditional, and if Jane were cheating she would be disowned and Ben and Max would be welcomed with open arms. \n\nSo, unless Ben can see the light, I'm not sure there's going to be any concessions from him. I have urged Jane to see a family law attorney in this state.", "Info: why does Ben think Jane is cheating on him? Did someone present him with alleged evidence or what?", "No, nothing like that (at least as far as I'm aware). Ben has experienced several traumatic events over the last year, which have affected his mental health. I think the allegations of cheating are based more in his own insecurities rather than actual fact.\n\nOnce again, I'm not saying this just because Jane is my cousin. I and the rest of my family take a very dim view of cheating and would not hesitate to cut Jane loose if theses allegations were credible.", "I see, thanks for clearing that up for me. I didn't want to make it seem as if I don't take your word for it or trust your judgement of Jane's character (I do), but I was curious what led Ben to think his wife was having an affair and whether someone wanted him to believe that.", "In some places, the law allows a visitation schedule to be set up for significant members of a child's life. She has been in his life for 12 years, so I would say that's a significant person. Also, in some places, once a child reaches a certain age of 12, they get a say in things, and they also may get a lawyer appointed to them so they get their wishes heard. \n\nPersonally, I would get her to ask her soon to be ex if she could possibly draw up a visitation schedule between the two of them if the son would like this. Also, point out that she has a conversation with the son and says that no matter what happens , you are always just a phone call away and so us the whole family.\n\nNo atseholes here.", "Max can have a say as to what he wants, surely? Jane can express her love for him and relay her hopes/wishes to soon to be ex husband (hopefully not an ugly divorce) in a letter, that she is fully there for Max, and wants to keep the relationship going with him. He needs continuity - especially now. She and husband need to discuss this process with him as an equal, and find out what he wants and needs, before they just decide without his input. He is old enough to make choices.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't have any legal right to Max at all.\n\nDoes Jane get on okay with Max's mother?  His mother may be happy to let Jane spend some time with him (and you and your parents) because you are a big part of his life.  She can phrase it as a form of stability in an unstable situation.\n\nThe other thing is that Max may act out a little (from the instability of what's happening) and his mother may appreciate a break with 'family' members who care for Max and are a listening ear.\n\nBen sounds like he's got some other issues going on.  Is he open to seeing a therapist.  He may have an underlying mental health issue that's driving this.\n\nAnd if his behaviour has suddenly changed... I'd be worried about a medical issue and a brain MRI may be a consideration.", "tl;dr as a professional YTA - your brother has the emotional burden and made the request for you to talk to Jane. \n\nThis whole thing reminds me of a story I heard once. Picture this legal eagle, all brains and no heart, just laying down the cold hard facts without considering the emotional toll. Your situation is like that, you know? It\u2019s crucial to be a pro, sure, but it's equally vital to be empathetic and aware of the emotional load folks are carrying. I mean, you can't just drop legal knowledge bombs and leave everyone else to deal with the fallout, right?\n\nThat's what your cousin and her fam needed: not just the legal lowdown but a bit of compassion too. It's a lesson for all of us to recognize that life isn't just about rules and regulations; it's about understanding the human side of things and lending a hand in a way that eases the burden. \n\nLooks like the legal advice might need a second opinion on this one. With the biological dad making this request, the plot legally thickens.", "NAH. I don't think it's necessarily what you said but more so how you said it. You making a face, being reluctant to share your thoughts and then admitting that she has no right to demand custody probably made her feel quite judged. The face you made especially, I think, maybe made her feel like you were atleast thinking she was stupid for thinking she'd get to see Max still.\n\nI think maybe just sit down with her, apologise and just try to explain that you didn't mean to upset her or hurt her feelings, you just didn't want to get her hopes up that she had legal ground to stand on with this, yknow? Best of luck to everyone involved. Sounds like a tough situation.", "NTa\n\n\"If you lie to someone it upsets them. If you tell them a truth they don't like it upsets them. If you sit and stare at them without answering it upsets them. No matter what I said or did she would be upset. So its best to upset with the truth, than lie.\"", "NTA- They wanted advice, and you were honest. It's better she KNOWS than to be unprepared.", "NTA.  Sometimes the truth sucks.  And in cases like this,  if she can keep a civil relationship with her ex, maybe he'll understand that she has a real role in Max's life.  Chances are high that his dad will use Max against her though. That's not your fault,  and your cousin hoping you'd know a miracle law that would give her a chance is not her fault. Lying to her would not have helped anyone in this situation.  \n\nThere's a tiny chance that the judge would take Max's wishes into consideration in this,  as he 15, but they would not be required to.  I wouldn't let your cousin hang onto that as hope.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are all AHs. How would lying to her have helped?", "\u201cWe want legal advice\u201d\n\u201cYour legal advice upset her wahhhhhhhhhh\u201d\n\nLol", "She cannot be upset at the reality and maybe it only dawned on her when the lawyer cousin said it. I highly doubt keeping her in the mindset of she'll get some form of custody would've helped. Sometimes hard truths are just that hard. Give your cousin the space she needs. Nta you did her a massive favor.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nShe wanted free professional advice but can\u2019t handle the truth and yet you have to care about her feelings as extended family? Tough spot.

Yes, you told the factual truth, but you did it in the way most calculated to be upsetting to your cousin. That is not emotionally supportive behavior.\n\nYou could have conveyed the same info in a more supportive way with no extra effort. \"Yes I understand that you love Max. We all care for him and see him as part of the family. It might not be feasible to maintain a close connection during the divorce because he isn't legally your child, but as a family we will support you and welcome him if possible. Worst-case scenario, we should make sure he knows that door is open so when he is 18 he will have broader chances to make his own choices.\"", "Nta. This is why you don't date single mothers. No rights only responsibilities.", "NTA.  I think the biggest thing here is that max is told that you all still love him and consider him your family.  Jane needs to appeal to her ex to allow her to see and have access to max.  \n\nShe does still need to get her full share of their joint assets.  Not just say all I care about is max, because that is just stupid.  This has happened with people I know that the woman says something like, he is the one that put the money in the 401k so it is his.  That is BS.  You both saved as a family for retirement and you deserve a share.  Try to convince her to work for a fair split of assets AND for access to continue to see max.  Likely she will be able to see him some but not a regular custody schedule like she would if she were a bio parent.", "NTA - You offered honest fact-based advice when asked (and pressed), and did so even after trying to protect her feelings. It\u2019s certainly a poor circumstances for them, but they\u2019re best going into things with their eyes open..", "NTA. If you'd sugarcoated or lied and things turned out badly later, they'd be a lot more upset with you for not warning them. Jane is just going through a very difficult time right now, I'm sure she'll come around. Best wishes to you all!", "NTA - You did nothing wrong, you stated the facts after she was adamant you tell her your thoughts. That she doesn't like them is not your problem. \n\nYou were asked a question, if they wanted an answer that just coddled her, they should have said so. \n\nEven if she is the most parental figure the kid has in his life it doesn't change anything legally and wishful thinking isn't helping.", "INFO: why did you tell her she doesn't have a chance when most states actually do have laws giving stepparents the right to sue for custody/visitation if they can prove they acted as a parent and it's in the child's best interests to maintain a relationship with them?\n\nThey can also make an agreement in regards to custody and put it in their divorce decree, why did you not suggest that?\n\n\nWhy did you tell her she is helpless and had no options when that isn't true?", "No, you're not the asshole. However, I have a question... what level of contact was your cousin looking for? If she wanted to deliver him birthday and Christmas presents and maybe occasionally take him out to the cinema or McDonald's, I can't see anyone having a problem with that.\n\nHowever, anything more formal or regular might interfere with his relationship with his parents.\n\nIt might have helped to clarify her hopes and expectations and help her come to an acceptable compromise rather than going down the strict legal route. However, that's not on you. You were involved due to your role as a lawyer.\n\nIf you were brought in as a lawyer, that suggests that previous attempts at a reasonable compromise have failed.\n\nThis suggests the presence of an asshole or two, but they aren't you.", "I don\u2019t know how it is in the US, but in my country (the Netherlands) stepparents have legal obligations towards stepchildren but also some rights. Like a visitation right if they helped raise the child for a certain amount of time. That period of time is not stated in the law. Can be different for every situation. Children in my country also have the right to decide who they want to see when they are 12 years and older. It is not possible to seperate in the Netherlands without a judge when there are children involved. And the judge will look at what is best for a child (and will ask this child what they want). So if a child says \u201cI want my stepparent in my life\u201d the judge will grant this to the child even if the biological/ legal parent does not want to. Especially at 15. But also the other way around. If a child says they don\u2019t want to visit their stepparent, they don\u2019t have to.", "It actually is untrue, most states allow stepparents to sue for visitation/custody if they can prove they had a parental relationship with the child and that it's in the child's best interests to continue have a relationship with them.\n\nThere is no need to have adopted them. Being their stepmother actually is having a legal relationship to them contrary to popular culture based myths", "I think having Jane assure Max that she and the rest of the family will always be there for him is an excellent idea. Hopefully a family law attorney in this state can better advise her as to what her options for visitation are.", "Max can certainly express his wishes, and at his age they will probably be taken into account. However, the point is that Jane has no legal basis to assert custody or visitation rights - and I have no idea how nasty this divorce will be. I've heard it said that you never really know your spouse until you go through a divorce ... and I guess we're about to find out what Ben is really like.", "Jane's relationship with Max's mom is best described as \"rocky.\" Like I said, Max's mom is a little unstable. Her attitude toward Jane and Ben alternates between being happy to have someone to take Max off her hands and attempting to spitefully manipulate Max to get digs in at Jane and her ex-husband. Fortunately, Max is a pretty smart and empathetic kid and usually sees right through her antics. \n\nAs for Ben, I'm not sure an MRI would catch any of his issues ... but a therapist might do the trick. Over the last year and a half, he's lost his mom (breast cancer), dad (stroke), and older brother (drug overdose). He was also passed over for a major promotion at work due to some petty office politics. So, I'm sure he's dealing with a lot. I encouraged Jane to attempt reconciliation and seek professional help with their marital issues.", "Ben was technically a single father ... but yes, the same principle applies. I dated a single mother in my late 20s and fell hard for her and the kid. It was a very painful experience.", "And those are some examples of emotionally supportive things you *could have said* instead of \"don't be stupid, you have no hope of staying in his life.\"", "Family law is not my area of expertise ... but according to my limited research, stepparents in the United States cannot assert visitation or custody rights absent adoption or some type of guardian arrangement with the biological parents. \n\nHowever, courts are generally respectful of the wishes of older children - so if Max says he wants to have Jane in his life, a  judge would probably honor that request. But the difference is that Jane cannot rely on an automatic presumption that she will have access to Max in the event that she and Ben get divorced. \n\nThis is why I advised Jane and her family to seek the services of a family law attorney in their state.", "I am pretty sure Max would want to spend time with his stepfamily either way, even if he doesn't have a legal connection anymore or at all, but the emotional connection and since he sees your family as siblings/cousins/uncles/aunts and everything, why would he stop seeing you guys? Big NTA :) \nYes, the truth does hurt, but better hear it from someone close now than a stranger later on.", "In my country I would not get visitation with my stepkid if I divorced my partner, but if my partner died I would have gotten visitation due to my kids, which are my stepkids siblings.", "In some places like where I am you can draw up visitation papers without lawyers if both parties are civil to each other. This is what my ex and I did. We then just lodged them with the court to make them legal. \n\nAs he is 15 he definitely can have his say here too and in most places it's encouraged. The only thing your sister may not be able to do is speak to schools,drs, and other professionals about him as she no longer has the guardianship she had over him while married to the dad.", "Except that isn't what he said. Didn't imply she was stupid, or that there was no hope. She was asking for his advice, and he gave it. The situation is entirely out of his cousin's hands.

Cause I think that we have both read 2 completely different stories", "Thank you for explaining. That is interesting to know. She really needs to sort things out with Ben and also Max. \n\n And yes, I think it is always wise to seek advice from a family law attorney in their state. I practice law myself (Dutch criminal law with a lot of knowledge about some other European countries\u2019 criminal law).

But Ben's rationale is that Jane went on a work trip with one of her coworkers (a gay man), and that she went on a girls' trip (where she shared a room with three friends). Neither of those instance raise any red flags for me.", "Is there any chance Ben might be the one cheating? Cause that could also explain why he is accusing Jane like that...", "Honestly - I doubt it. I don't know enough about their circumstances to say for sure, but Jane doesn't think so.", "NTA, but, as someone who had a superhero divorce attorney, you aren't entitled to many things in a divorce, doesn't mean you cant get them. If Jane's soon-to-be ex has his son's best interests at heart, he'll want to facilitate the continuation of that relationship and that's a conversation she should have with him. It's in everybody's best interest for her to remain in the son's life. It can then be included in the divorce document.", "NTA. As an attorney I run into this all the time.

I also tell them the reason I don't do family law: no one is ever happy with the result because the courts bend over backwards to be fair to all parties, thus no one gets exactly what they want and it's always the attorney's fault.\n\nOnce things calm down, I would sit down and talk to her apologizing for not putting it in softer terms, but she said she wanted my true opinion. Just because it's my opinion doesn't mean that's what's going to happen. Maybe explain that it's been ingrained in you as an attorney that you don't tell people what they want to hear, you tell them how things look to you.\n\nThere are some good ideas in the responses about how she can keep in touch although not through the court order unless her soon to be ex is a real a\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* and wants to punish her by keeping his son from your family.\n\nBest of luck, I feel your pain.", "NTA\n\nWhile Max is old enough to know what he wants and who he wants to spend time with, he unfortunately isn't old enough for his wishes to outweigh his parents decisions, and she needs to be prepared for that scenario. \n\nShe needs to have the conversation with her soon to be ex and see where he will stand on this going forward. \n\nMy brother went through a similar situation. He got together with his ex when her youngest was a few months old, he is the only dad she's ever known, but he never adopted her and he and his ex never actually married. When they split she was in her teens and he had to practically plead with her to let him still see her daughter. Fortunately she let him, but in the beginning she did use the time he got to spend with her as a bargaining chip, and he was constantly scared he'd lose her altogether.", "NTA.\n\nI'm not an attorney, let alone a family attorney, but I've always assumed that Stepparents are out of luck.  Like you said, she didn't and - considering Mom was a mess but still alive and hadn't waived her parental rights - couldn't adopt him.  That gives her zip, zero, nada rights - even if they both wanted it.\n\nI'm sorry for her, I really am, but I think you did her a favor by planting the seed in her head that she probably isn't going to be able to see him again until he's legal (and longer if her ex is crummy enough to make financial support after college, which most young people need, contingent upon Ben not seeing you).", "This fucking sucks balls. I've been where Jane is, and had to walk away from kids I had raised since small. \n\nNTA. I wish everything of the best to your family (especially Max)", "NTA. Sounds like you just gave her general legal advice that she would get from any lawyer or legal forum given the basic facts of her divorce case. You're a lawyer, not a therapist.", "NTA, this is the exact reason people, men and women, hesitate when getting into a relationship with a single parent.  If the relationship goes south, any bond they make with the child is just that, a bond, there are no legal rights or entitlements.

It might not have been kind, but it was true and it was necessary. NTA.", "YTA. You don't practice family law, and you have no idea what you're talking about.\n\nMy stepfather divorced my mom, and he got visitation rights for me in the process. This is a normal, regular thing that does in fact happen regularly. The courts care about the child more than anything, and at 15 years old they're going to hear from this child as to his opinion. That means that there's a very, very good chance she actually will get visitation.\n\nYou should have simply said \"I don't practice family law, but I know someone I can refer you to\". Instead you gave completely wrong advice that upset your family member.", "I don't get something here.\n\nINFO: If Max had to live somewhere else, why are you saying you'd \"never see him again\"? That sounds like stupid hyperbole to me.  Is a judge going to ban him from visiting his friends? He's not a prisoner, just a minor.  If in the US, he'll have a license to drive soon. Cheap cars are cheap.\n\nI guess i just don't see the panic here. In less than three years he'll be a legal adult. Crucial years, to be sure, but he's gaining autonomy and independence in that time.  Is it really that dire?\n\nEdit: down votes for requesting info?? Fuck this sub.", "YTA. Not for saying things too harshly, but for giving poor legal advice in an area you don't understand and have no experience in. Please encourage your cousin to speak to a real family lawyer, and stress that you have no idea what you're talking about and to disregard what you previously said.", "YTA because you didn't tell her the truth. You don't know what a court will do in that situation. At 15, the court will take his views into consideration as well. And she and ex can agree to a visitation schedule. There's many ways this can go. Please apologize for upsetting her and tell her you shouldn't have said what you did, and you hope things will be worked out for what's best for Max all around.", "YTA because you advised her on something you aren't familiar with. You needed to tell her you didn't know the law in this area well enough to advise her and refer her to an actual family attorney.\n\nShe does have options here. \n\nA friend of mine lived with a woman for about 3 years. Woman has a young daughter who called our friend daddy. He is not the child's father, never married the mother and never adopted the child. \n\nThey broke up. He took her to court for shared custody of this child and won. Court determined that he was such an integral part of this child's life that it would be detrimental to her to not be allowed to see him. \n\nNow he has her every other weekend. \n\nYou need to refer her to an actual family attorney because she does have rights to at least visitation with Max.", "NTA at all.", "NTA, the truth is exactly what you stated. She has no legal right to demand visitation. She can appeal to her soon to be ex husband's better judgement about not separating Max from the family, and Max is of an age where his thoughts and feelings can be asked and taken into account but that's about it. It's better not to sugar coat the truth when it comes to legal battles. The judge and lawyers certainly won't.", "NAH.\n\nWhilst what you said was technically true, I think you could have given some advice about asking to see Max. Whether Ben agrees is another story, but it is possible and could be likely since she isn\u2019t trying to get money out of him.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, you were honest. From a family perspective a little more tact could have been used at this painful time for your cousin.", "I don't think you are the AH for the content of what you said, especially given that Jane insisted you express your opinion, but I think you could have been more tactful in how you delivered that information. Further, did she really want you to give a legal opinion, or did she just want you to give her emotional support? I'd probably say light YTA.\n\nIs the divorce contentious? If it's amicable, I don't know that Jane has anything to worry about, but if it's contentious and they both kind of want to hurt each other, I suppose it's possible that Ben might try to keep Max from seeing anyone even if it's an inconvenience to him.", "NTA. She heard the same thing from you (empathetically) that she would pay to hear from a different lawyer.\n\nShe demanded to hear the truth.", "Since he is 15, I would have your cousin, Jane, let him , Max know she and your family will always be there for him.Her door is always open for him, etc. I would also have her talk to the soon to be ex about the desire to remain in the boys life. At 15, the courts, if it comes to it, will at least hear what the boy has to say but it could be that Max's bio parents won't mind if you continue to be there for him\nAlso, NTA, sharing their legal rights, ie. None is important to hear now so she can prepare.", "NTA.\n\nBad news is best delivered early. She may not like to have heard it, but at least she has some time to prepare her heart before things change. She probably won't say it, but she'll be thankful you ripped the bandaid off quickly, when she comes around.", "NTA. Jane asked for advice, and you gave it. OP said she wasn't licensed.", "NTA.  But Max should be able to see Jane and she him if that is what HE wants, legal issues notwithstanding.  A fifteen year old should be able to demand this and have this respected.", "NTA, someone would have eventually said it to her and she probably would have been upset no matter who told her. It's unfortunate in a lot of ways, but stepparents don't have a standing over step kids once the marriage between the parent and the stepparent is over. You could have not said it given that Dan said Jane was looking for emotional support but it wasn't untrue and it doesn't sound like you said it in an overly mean way either.", "NTA. Speaking from a purely legal perspective, what you stated was fact but I think your cousin was looking for a more subjective opinion about her personal desire to keep a relationship between Max and your family. Of course it will be up to his biological parents, but if the divorce is not acrimonious maybe they can work it out. Maybe it's time to take your lawyer hat off and give advice as a friend. I hope things work out so Max can stay as \"part of the family.\"", "NTA. While you could have been more sensitive to her feelings, nothing you said was untrue. The reality of it is painful and might not have been the best thing to say at that moment, but she insisted you speaking what was on your mind. In the moment it is difficult to think of the 'best' thing to say- though perhaps something like, \"while you have no legal right to visitation since you never adopted him, hopefully your ex will let you see him every now and then,\" would have been easier for her to hear.", "NTA...you were stating facts according to the law. I think a lot would depend on how amicable their divorce becomes. If her husband allows his don to stay in contact, that's great. But she should prepare for the worst. Things can get crazy during a divorce. Maybe if she can ask her soon-to-be ex if they could all sit down with his son and talk about the divorce.", "To be honest, it is something she needed to hear. Either in order to prepare for it, or to fight for it. \n\nHopefully she can talk to her soon-to-be ex and work something out. \n\nNTA", "No", "NTA. Problem here is that you told the truth and gave facts. Everyone else as there to make her feel good.", "NTA, I learned a long time ago when I had a roommate with a child. We worked opposite shifts, the Dad was not involved, so I essentially became a '3rd parent'. Well as an unofficial parent I had no say or involvement after they moved on in their lives. \n\nIt is such a tight rope to walk in these situations. Falling in love with a child and have zero rights is tough. Not everyone can hold back that little part of themselves that shatters in these situations. You did the correct thing in providing everyone a legal answer. Luckily Max is 15, so he can decide his level of contact.", "Nta. You told her the truth. She has no legal rights to him. That doesn't mean she can't see him, but its something she needs to work out with her soon to be ex. If he's a good dad and Max wants a relationship, he will be okay with it", "NTA. She didn't need to have sunshine blown up her butt, she needed the truth. Only armed with the truth can she move forward. Knowing the truth, she has the ability to plan. Maybe talk to Max's parents about wanting to give him continuity during a hugely disruptive time in his life. But without knowing the true situation, she'd be set up to fail.", "NTA - Your cousin asked for your assessment of the situation and you gave it. \n\nHowever, I really don\u2019t understand all these comments describing what OP said as \u201cadvice.\u201d From reading his reply comments, it seems the only piece of advice OP actually offered to Jane and her family is to hire an attorney who specializes in family law. Which is perfectly reasonable.\n\nOP\u2019s comment at the kitchen table seems like just that - a comment. Jane said the only thing she wanted was to keep Max in her life, which she thought would be fine since she is his stepmother. OP indicated the issue might not be that cut and dry for reasons x, y, and z. \n\nOP didn\u2019t recommend a course of action, which is what one typically does when solicited for advice. He only informed Jane that she was probably facing an uphill battle \u2026 which could very well be true depending on how spiteful Ben wants to be.", "NTA. You just told her the legal truth, if her soon to be ex is okay with him continuing a familial relationship, that would be great, but that is the only way it would be possible. I hope everything works out in a way that the kid can continue to have some sense of normalcy in his life, divorce is hard enough as it is.", "Nta. It's true that it most likely won't work out for her that well but in some cases I know depending on how long and how involved a person has been in a child's life she might be able to get visitation. I forgot what is called but she likely could since she did help raise him for over a decade. Still nta but maybe you could look up the laws to in your state for it to help her. And at least at that point you can't say you didn't try to help her. Wish her and you the best.", "NTA", "NTA \u2014 people who want everyone to lie to people to avoid uncomfortable conversations amaze me. You weren\u2019t trying to tell her either.

I\u2019m not a lawyer and I would have told her the same thing, with the caveat that I\u2019m not a lawyer in any state. \n\nAre you \u201ca jerk\u201d for telling her when she insisted instead of letting her be surprised by her divorce lawyer?  Would her divorce lawyer be \u201ca jerk\u201d if they were the ones to break the news to her?  It sounds like you told her in as gentle a way as possible. \n\nIf the divorce isn\u2019t terribly acrimonious then her soon-to-be-ex might be willing to let her maintain a part in Max\u2019s life. If Jane doesn\u2019t ask/offer Ben would probably assume that she doesn\u2019t want to but this could build for a better divorce process. Even though Jane has no legal right to Max, in all likelihood, if Dan, as Max\u2019s father and legal guardian, want to allow Jane to maintain contact with Max then he can do that.", "NAH", "NTA\n\nI don't understand people who get angry when they ask an expert for their advice and then don't like the advice. It's extremely immature.\n\nJane absolutely needed to know the information you told her. Divorces can, of course, be really acrimonious, and the only way she can try to keep a relationship with Max is through Ben's good graces. Distasteful as it might be, she is going to have to play very nice to try to get what she wants here. Your advice was critically important.\n\nI hope it works out.", "Did she really, though? Dan was the one who initially called OP for legal advice-it's unclear whether he did so on Jane's request or if he took the initiative himself. And when OP was there, Jane hadn't asked OP for any legal advice. She asked why OP made a face, yeah, and then OP, despite admitting that he's not in family law, gave an opinion that he knew the family was likely to trust just bc he's a lawyer. And that opinion that lacks actual knowledge on custodial/visitation laws.", "Stepparents aren't completely out of luck - like some other posters have noted, they can petition for visitation rights. \n\nHowever, when speaking to my cousin and her family, I chose my words very carefully. Given the fact that Jane had not adopted or assumed legal guardianship of Max, I said she had no basis to ***demand*** custody and/or visitation rights.\n\nThat means her access to Max in the future will depend on what she can negotiate with Ben and what a court will approve. In short, there are no guarantees, and I wanted to prepare them for that possibility.", "Okay, I can see a few things need to be cleared up.\n\nFirst, I'm not the one who said we would \"never see \\[Max\\] again\" in the event of a death or divorce. That was a comment made by one of my brothers. A little hyperbolic, sure - but it illustrates that many of us have long realized how tenuous Max's connection to our family is. \n\nSecond, Max's mom lives about an hour away, and Ben's job is a lot closer to that town than our town. Ben and Max only moved to our town because Jane had lived there her entire life and wanted to be close to her parents. But with Jane out of the picture, I could see Ben wanting to shorten his commute. An hour drive is certainly not an insurmountable distance, but it would make things more difficult than they are now. \n\nThird, I couldn't imagine a judge banning Max from seeing his friends. But I could see Ben or Max's mom attempting to restrict his time around people that might be sympathetic to Jane. I hope that wouldn't be the case, but people can get nasty in divorces.", "Didn\u2019t read the story or the comments, eh? \n\nIf you had, you would know that he investigated the scenario and did tell them to get a local family law attorney.", "Honeslty, she needs to bring this up with Ben now.

Your family said all the time that above anything she was seeking emotional support, not exactly legal advice. I'm not saying you should sugarcoat the legal part of it, but you could have preceded the complicated part with the softer part where even if not legally recognized as a part of the family it still doesn't mean family members will never see him again.\n\nOf course, there is always \"a better thing one could have said\" and often it's something you can't realize in advance before even saying something else and getting a reaction.", "Why would they be forbidden from seeing each other outside of school?", "> It actually is untrue, most states\n\nThis is where your comment simply falls apart. OP knows the state, and did *some* cursory research and is a proper lawyer, even if they don't practice in this state or area of law, they will know better than you or I how to research the standards and have more resources to do it.\n\nYour state-agnostic claim that it's untrue is pointless. I'll take the informed opinion of a lawyer who admits the limitations of their expertise over an armchair comment that doesn't even know the jurisdiction the situation is occurring in.", "Yup- my step father got visitation of me. OP is a horrible lawyer for giving legal advice in a specialty they know nothing about.", "I disagree. You don't know that OP lacks actual knowledge.

I told Jane that she has no basis to demand custody and/or visitation rights, meaning that her status as Max's stepmom doesn't automatically convey those rights.\n\nRather, her access to Max will depend on any arrangement she can make with Ben and what a court will approve. Sadly, there are no guarantees.", "Or to a friend or a family member. Having a job doesn't take away your ability to be empathetic. Being someone who works in artistic or creative fields doesn't take away your ability to tell a kid their beginner drawing looks amazing. Accepting that a part of your personality is being insensitive towards something because of your profession even though you're literally able to discuss the sensitive part of it (as, you know, OP did on his own comment) is if anything a shell to refuse improvement on how you handle interpersonal relationships.\n\nAnd like, therapists exist for a reason and I can guarantee that reason isn't \"shouldering all of this person's interpersonal needs\".", "Nah, we all have the skills to be kind and empathetic. You don't need a therapist to experience it", "Is what he said the truth?

I'm not said he shouldn't have said what he said, that he's wrong or anything like that.\n\nIn all honesty, it's sorta weird how much is being projected and twisted here from things I already addressed in my initial comment.", "That may not be what he said, but from her reaction that is how she *heard* it.", "But, he did do some research, and while the divorce might end up complicated, this actually isn\u2019t all that complicated at heart, since the kid in question has two living parents who share custody.", "He.

Again, I'm not saying he should have omitted them, but from all we've been told she was asking the opinion of a family member who happens to be a lawyer, not asking him to be some pre-attorney for her.\n\n- yes, he could have said something harsher. I have mentioned, again, that we can think of countless \"could have\" scenarios in our minds. What makes us choose how to act is just how we want to be. I didn't even say he *should have* said something, and this is the key on why I think you guys are somewhat misunderstanding the intention behind my comment. I'm not blaming him for what he said, but if he wants to prevent such an emotional response a next time he now knows a possible course of action that would reduce impact when giving a negative answer towards questions that involve legal matters.
