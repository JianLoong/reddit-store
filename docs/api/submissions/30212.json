They all go to the same high school, so it would be weird if they were suddenly forbidden from associating with each other outside of school. \n\nAlso, on a more practical note - my oldest nephew has a car and driver's license and will often drive Max and his brother home from school and sports practice. If Max was suddenly forbidden from seeing anyone in our family, it would be a massive inconvenience for Ben and his ex-wife.", "Sigh ... I'm afraid so. This is why I don't practice family law - money is easy, lives and families are fragile.", "Thank you for saying this - there have been many times over the years when we've all wished that Max was Jane's biological son. \n\nHowever, as my older brother said, \"The problem with Jane's situation is that she has no permanent connection with Max. If Ben died, or if Jane and Ben got divorced, none of us would ever see Max again.\"\n\nI guess we're about to find out.", "I sympathize with this - but what's the \"softer way\" to tell a beloved relative that she has no legal claim to the child she's raised for over a decade? It's an overall terrible situation.", "My knowledge of family law is limited to single course I took in law school - now more than a decade ago. I made that abundantly clear. \n\nI also said that Max, being a teenager, could express his own wishes to the court. Even still, I urged Jane and her family to talk to a family law attorney licensed in their state.", "I would take the angle of (when asked \"will this be a problem\"),  \"Its really going to depend on how contentious this is going to be.  So, bare facts here, There isn't really anything you can do legally\" - which you have explained - \" BUT, you should   talk to Ben and impress upon him that you consider Max is still part of your family, and that you still want to be able to be inviting him to family things, want to show up at his school events, and like that.   You are a better judge than me of how amenable Ben will be for something like that.   Again, this isn't anything that can be a part of a divorce decree, but you can try and have a sort of 'gentlemens agreement'. \"   and then add something like \"Also, its not going to hurt to talk to your attorney about this.  I suspect that they will say the same thing, but you never know.  \" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMAybe that would have had the same result.  But its at least a little softer.", "I'm afraid the divorce will be a contentious affair. Ben isn't in a good place right now and thinks Jane is cheating on him. I know for a fact that Jane isn't cheating - our family is very traditional, and if Jane were cheating she would be disowned and Ben and Max would be welcomed with open arms. \n\nSo, unless Ben can see the light, I'm not sure there's going to be any concessions from him. I have urged Jane to see a family law attorney in this state.", "Info: why does Ben think Jane is cheating on him? Did someone present him with alleged evidence or what?", "No, nothing like that (at least as far as I'm aware). Ben has experienced several traumatic events over the last year, which have affected his mental health. I think the allegations of cheating are based more in his own insecurities rather than actual fact.\n\nOnce again, I'm not saying this just because Jane is my cousin. I and the rest of my family take a very dim view of cheating and would not hesitate to cut Jane loose if theses allegations were credible.", "I see, thanks for clearing that up for me. I didn't want to make it seem as if I don't take your word for it or trust your judgement of Jane's character (I do), but I was curious what led Ben to think his wife was having an affair and whether someone wanted him to believe that.", "In some places, the law allows a visitation schedule to be set up for significant members of a child's life. She has been in his life for 12 years, so I would say that's a significant person. Also, in some places, once a child reaches a certain age of 12, they get a say in things, and they also may get a lawyer appointed to them so they get their wishes heard. \n\nPersonally, I would get her to ask her soon to be ex if she could possibly draw up a visitation schedule between the two of them if the son would like this. Also, point out that she has a conversation with the son and says that no matter what happens , you are always just a phone call away and so us the whole family.\n\nNo atseholes here.", "Max can have a say as to what he wants, surely? Jane can express her love for him and relay her hopes/wishes to soon to be ex husband (hopefully not an ugly divorce) in a letter, that she is fully there for Max, and wants to keep the relationship going with him. He needs continuity - especially now. She and husband need to discuss this process with him as an equal, and find out what he wants and needs, before they just decide without his input. He is old enough to make choices.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't have any legal right to Max at all.\n\nDoes Jane get on okay with Max's mother?  His mother may be happy to let Jane spend some time with him (and you and your parents) because you are a big part of his life.  She can phrase it as a form of stability in an unstable situation.\n\nThe other thing is that Max may act out a little (from the instability of what's happening) and his mother may appreciate a break with 'family' members who care for Max and are a listening ear.\n\nBen sounds like he's got some other issues going on.  Is he open to seeing a therapist.  He may have an underlying mental health issue that's driving this.\n\nAnd if his behaviour has suddenly changed... I'd be worried about a medical issue and a brain MRI may be a consideration.", "tl;dr as a professional YTA - your brother has the emotional burden and made the request for you to talk to Jane. \n\nThis whole thing reminds me of a story I heard once. Picture this legal eagle, all brains and no heart, just laying down the cold hard facts without considering the emotional toll. Your situation is like that, you know? It\u2019s crucial to be a pro, sure, but it's equally vital to be empathetic and aware of the emotional load folks are carrying. I mean, you can't just drop legal knowledge bombs and leave everyone else to deal with the fallout, right?\n\nThat's what your cousin and her fam needed: not just the legal lowdown but a bit of compassion too. It's a lesson for all of us to recognize that life isn't just about rules and regulations; it's about understanding the human side of things and lending a hand in a way that eases the burden. \n\nLooks like the legal advice might need a second opinion on this one. With the biological dad making this request, the plot legally thickens.", "NAH. I don't think it's necessarily what you said but more so how you said it. You making a face, being reluctant to share your thoughts and then admitting that she has no right to demand custody probably made her feel quite judged. The face you made especially, I think, maybe made her feel like you were atleast thinking she was stupid for thinking she'd get to see Max still.\n\nI think maybe just sit down with her, apologise and just try to explain that you didn't mean to upset her or hurt her feelings, you just didn't want to get her hopes up that she had legal ground to stand on with this, yknow? Best of luck to everyone involved. Sounds like a tough situation.", "NTa\n\n\"If you lie to someone it upsets them. If you tell them a truth they don't like it upsets them. If you sit and stare at them without answering it upsets them. No matter what I said or did she would be upset. So its best to upset with the truth, than lie.\"", "NTA- They wanted advice, and you were honest. It's better she KNOWS than to be unprepared.", "NTA.  Sometimes the truth sucks.  And in cases like this,  if she can keep a civil relationship with her ex, maybe he'll understand that she has a real role in Max's life.  Chances are high that his dad will use Max against her though. That's not your fault,  and your cousin hoping you'd know a miracle law that would give her a chance is not her fault. Lying to her would not have helped anyone in this situation.  \n\nThere's a tiny chance that the judge would take Max's wishes into consideration in this,  as he 15, but they would not be required to.  I wouldn't let your cousin hang onto that as hope.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are all AHs. How would lying to her have helped?", "\u201cWe want legal advice\u201d\n\u201cYour legal advice upset her wahhhhhhhhhh\u201d\n\nLol", "She cannot be upset at the reality and maybe it only dawned on her when the lawyer cousin said it. I highly doubt keeping her in the mindset of she'll get some form of custody would've helped. Sometimes hard truths are just that hard. Give your cousin the space she needs. Nta you did her a massive favor.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nShe wanted free professional advice but can\u2019t handle the truth and yet you have to care about her feelings as extended family? Tough spot. Don\u2019t think you were harsh at all.", "You gave honest legal advice. \n\nNTA", "Another example of people reaping what they sow by pushing for someone to tell them something, being told it then getting upset despite pushing for it in the first place. NTA", "YTA because you were specifically advised that you were there for \"*emotional* support\" not legal advice. Yes, you told the factual truth, but you did it in the way most calculated to be upsetting to your cousin. That is not emotionally supportive behavior.\n\nYou could have conveyed the same info in a more supportive way with no extra effort. \"Yes I understand that you love Max. We all care for him and see him as part of the family. It might not be feasible to maintain a close connection during the divorce because he isn't legally your child, but as a family we will support you and welcome him if possible. Worst-case scenario, we should make sure he knows that door is open so when he is 18 he will have broader chances to make his own choices.\"", "Nta. This is why you don't date single mothers. No rights only responsibilities.", "NTA.  I think the biggest thing here is that max is told that you all still love him and consider him your family.  Jane needs to appeal to her ex to allow her to see and have access to max.  \n\nShe does still need to get her full share of their joint assets.  Not just say all I care about is max, because that is just stupid.  This has happened with people I know that the woman says something like, he is the one that put the money in the 401k so it is his.  That is BS.  You both saved as a family for retirement and you deserve a share.  Try to convince her to work for a fair split of assets AND for access to continue to see max.  Likely she will be able to see him some but not a regular custody schedule like she would if she were a bio parent.", "NTA - You offered honest fact-based advice when asked (and pressed), and did so even after trying to protect her feelings. It\u2019s certainly a poor circumstances for them, but they\u2019re best going into things with their eyes open..", "NTA. If you'd sugarcoated or lied and things turned out badly later, they'd be a lot more upset with you for not warning them. Jane is just going through a very difficult time right now, I'm sure she'll come around. Best wishes to you all!", "NTA - You did nothing wrong, you stated the facts after she was adamant you tell her your thoughts. That she doesn't like them is not your problem. \n\nYou were asked a question, if they wanted an answer that just coddled her, they should have said so. \n\nEven if she is the most parental figure the kid has in his life it doesn't change anything legally and wishful thinking isn't helping.", "INFO: why did you tell her she doesn't have a chance when most states actually do have laws giving stepparents the right to sue for custody/visitation if they can prove they acted as a parent and it's in the child's best interests to maintain a relationship with them?\n\nThey can also make an agreement in regards to custody and put it in their divorce decree, why did you not suggest that?\n\n\nWhy did you tell her she is helpless and had no options when that isn't true?", "No, you're not the asshole. However, I have a question... what level of contact was your cousin looking for? If she wanted to deliver him birthday and Christmas presents and maybe occasionally take him out to the cinema or McDonald's, I can't see anyone having a problem with that.\n\nHowever, anything more formal or regular might interfere with his relationship with his parents.\n\nIt might have helped to clarify her hopes and expectations and help her come to an acceptable compromise rather than going down the strict legal route. However, that's not on you. You were involved due to your role as a lawyer.\n\nIf you were brought in as a lawyer, that suggests that previous attempts at a reasonable compromise have failed.\n\nThis suggests the presence of an asshole or two, but they aren't you.", "I don\u2019t know how it is in the US, but in my country (the Netherlands) stepparents have legal obligations towards stepchildren but also some rights. Like a visitation right if they helped raise the child for a certain amount of time. That period of time is not stated in the law. Can be different for every situation. Children in my country also have the right to decide who they want to see when they are 12 years and older. It is not possible to seperate in the Netherlands without a judge when there are children involved. And the judge will look at what is best for a child (and will ask this child what they want). So if a child says \u201cI want my stepparent in my life\u201d the judge will grant this to the child even if the biological/ legal parent does not want to. Especially at 15. But also the other way around. If a child says they don\u2019t want to visit their stepparent, they don\u2019t have to.", "It actually is untrue, most states allow stepparents to sue for visitation/custody if they can prove they had a parental relationship with the child and that it's in the child's best interests to continue have a relationship with them.\n\nThere is no need to have adopted them. Being their stepmother actually is having a legal relationship to them contrary to popular culture based myths", "I think having Jane assure Max that she and the rest of the family will always be there for him is an excellent idea. Hopefully a family law attorney in this state can better advise her as to what her options for visitation are.", "Max can certainly express his wishes, and at his age they will probably be taken into account. However, the point is that Jane has no legal basis to assert custody or visitation rights - and I have no idea how nasty this divorce will be. I've heard it said that you never really know your spouse until you go through a divorce ... and I guess we're about to find out what Ben is really like.", "Jane's relationship with Max's mom is best described as \"rocky.\" Like I said, Max's mom is a little unstable. Her attitude toward Jane and Ben alternates between being happy to have someone to take Max off her hands and attempting to spitefully manipulate Max to get digs in at Jane and her ex-husband. Fortunately, Max is a pretty smart and empathetic kid and usually sees right through her antics. \n\nAs for Ben, I'm not sure an MRI would catch any of his issues ... but a therapist might do the trick. Over the last year and a half, he's lost his mom (breast cancer), dad (stroke), and older brother (drug overdose). He was also passed over for a major promotion at work due to some petty office politics. So, I'm sure he's dealing with a lot. I encouraged Jane to attempt reconciliation and seek professional help with their marital issues.", "Ben was technically a single father ... but yes, the same principle applies. I dated a single mother in my late 20s and fell hard for her and the kid. It was a very painful experience.", "And those are some examples of emotionally supportive things you *could have said* instead of \"don't be stupid, you have no hope of staying in his life.\"", "Family law is not my area of expertise ... but according to my limited research, stepparents in the United States cannot assert visitation or custody rights absent adoption or some type of guardian arrangement with the biological parents. \n\nHowever, courts are generally respectful of the wishes of older children - so if Max says he wants to have Jane in his life, a  judge would probably honor that request. But the difference is that Jane cannot rely on an automatic presumption that she will have access to Max in the event that she and Ben get divorced. \n\nThis is why I advised Jane and her family to seek the services of a family law attorney in their state.", "I am pretty sure Max would want to spend time with his stepfamily either way, even if he doesn't have a legal connection anymore or at all, but the emotional connection and since he sees your family as siblings/cousins/uncles/aunts and everything, why would he stop seeing you guys? Big NTA :) \nYes, the truth does hurt, but better hear it from someone close now than a stranger later on.", "In my country I would not get visitation with my stepkid if I divorced my partner, but if my partner died I would have gotten visitation due to my kids, which are my stepkids siblings.", "In some places like where I am you can draw up visitation papers without lawyers if both parties are civil to each other. This is what my ex and I did. We then just lodged them with the court to make them legal. \n\nAs he is 15 he definitely can have his say here too and in most places it's encouraged. The only thing your sister may not be able to do is speak to schools,drs, and other professionals about him as she no longer has the guardianship she had over him while married to the dad.", "Except that isn't what he said. Didn't imply she was stupid, or that there was no hope. She was asking for his advice, and he gave it. The situation is entirely out of his cousin's hands. And hindsight is 20/20, but in the moment maybe his explanation of the boy's school/hangout situation didn't immediately come to mind, being as OP doesn't even live in the same town.", "Where did you read that op said that? Cause I think that we have both read 2 completely different stories", "Thank you for explaining. That is interesting to know. She really needs to sort things out with Ben and also Max. \n\n And yes, I think it is always wise to seek advice from a family law attorney in their state. I practice law myself (Dutch criminal law with a lot of knowledge about some other European countries\u2019 criminal law). So I can get by for other kind of laws in general (like family law or private law) to some extend. But if they want real advice they need to ask an attorney.", "I hope Max will still come around - but with his age and lack of independent transportation, I'm not sure he could.", "OP is a \"he\" not a \"she\" btw", "Yeah ... I practice corporate law. Definitely not the person to ask about family law matters.", "They could still keep in contact, facetime and calls :) and then when he's 18, he could move back there if he wants (he seems like he really loves your family)", "Fixed!

It would be a shame if he lost that.", "Your comment made me confused at first so I double checked lmao", "Is there any other time to Reddit?", "Thanks - normally, I wouldn't be inclined to dismiss allegations of cheating. But Ben's rationale is that Jane went on a work trip with one of her coworkers (a gay man), and that she went on a girls' trip (where she shared a room with three friends). Neither of those instance raise any red flags for me.", "Is there any chance Ben might be the one cheating? Cause that could also explain why he is accusing Jane like that...", "Honestly - I doubt it. I don't know enough about their circumstances to say for sure, but Jane doesn't think so."]}
