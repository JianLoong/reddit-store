Sooner or later, you will start quarreling.", "Ha you know its not going to be a few weeks. Once he's moved in he's not going anywhere. Get him an airbnb for a month tell him he has a month to figure out what he's doing NTA", "Also, you know Dad's going to want to be the \"man of the house\" as soon as he steps through the door. OP's life is going to be utter misery if he lets this happen. I'd put my foot down, make it my hill to die on.", "Nope. Doesn\u2019t work that way. He\u2019s a freeloader and an AH not someone that needs to be looked after so there is no.. if we turn him away everyone gets turned away. Everyone isn\u2019t trying to mooch", "If he has money to move abroad and then back, he can find a place to stay for himself.  He's a grown man.\n\nIf he needs a transitional place, you can provide room and board under a signed contract.  The key idea is to incentivize him to be looking for other accommodations asap.\n\nThe first week is $75/day which includes two shared meals.  That is cheaper than a hotel.\n\nHe needs to be making arrangements for a place to stay once he hits the ground.\n\nThe second week is $100/day.  Frankly, he should have a signed lease by this point.\n\nThe third week, this is getting silly.  He should be gone by now.  He ought to find a cheap hotel at this point, because your rate is now $150/day per the signed agreement.\n\nWeek 4: $200/day.  Week 5: $250/day.  Week 6: $300/day.  No option for beyond week 6.  He can seek residence in the shelters or with other patsies.\n\nThe contract needs a fee schedule to curb any behavioral issues.  $100 for yelling, etc.\n\nFrankly, I'd ask for every week to be paid in advance.", "Scrape up the $$ for one month of a week-by-week apartment.  It will be the best $$ you have ever spent as opposed to letting him stay with you for a few weeks.\n\nNTA but do not let him stay with you even a night.\n\nIf you \\*must\\*, then you tell him that the first time he yells at your wife, he is **out**, no takebacks, no apologies, just **out**.  But you'll be better off paying $400-500 for him to have a cheap extended stay place for a month even if you starve yourselves that month.\n\nYou definitely have the right idea by wanting to set terms BEFORE he arrives.", "NTA\n\nDo not let this man move in or even stay for the night, otherwise he will never leave.", "Get off Reddit, OP's father-in-law!  And be nicer to women!", "NTA I think letting him stay at all is a mistake. He will not leave, you and your wife will fight when she refuses to evict him, this will not end well. I suspect you will move out before he does . but if you are going to then there has to be a firm end date. Anything more than a couple of weeks is ridiculous. Your wife needs to agree to a firm end date and that SHE will be the one to enforce it", "NTA\n\nYou not only have to make sure your wife communicates him he can only stay a few weeks, you will also have to make sure he doesn't feel too comfortable in your home fir even this short time. \n\nBut you also have to consider that dad will try to break you up so he has his daughter to take care of him - you need to be on the same page with her to not let this happen.", "This. But, OP, I wouldn't even let him stay for a few weeks. Your wife is already showing she'll side with him over you. You can volunteer to help find him a place to stay, but I wouldn't let him spend one night under your roof BECAUSE he won't have a home to return to in this situation and will absolutely settle in."]}
