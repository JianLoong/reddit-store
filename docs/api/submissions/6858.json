I've remarried Logan (35M) and we have been together for 7 years. Logan has cheated on me in the past, but we worked through it and our marriage has been stronger ever since. My daughter was out with some friends and spotted Logan with a woman who was not me. They followed them around and spotted them together at a restaurant. She took photographs of them, it didn't seem to be anything romantic at all but I still confronted Logan because he gave me very little details about where he was going that night. It turns out, the woman in the photos was his best friend's girlfriend who wanted help to propose to him. I was skeptical. He showed me all of their imessages and his story checked out. There was nothing romantic in the photos at all so I let it slide. Logan was very upset that my daughter and her friends had followed him and told me she should get some kind of consequences for that. I told him that since she had good intentions and was just concerned about me because of Logan's history I didn't see a problem at all. He told me that I was spoiling my daughter and that if she does these things with anyone else she could have gotten herself in serious trouble. He told me I am setting her up for failure in the real world.", "created_utc": 1673217443, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106wmxp/aita_for_not_punishing_my_daughter_for_following/", "score": 174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like he has more work to do on repairing his relationship with Jenn and honestly, he brought this on himself when he stepped out on you.", ">He told me that I was spoiling my daughter and that if she does these things with anyone else she could have gotten herself in serious trouble.\n\nShe wouldn't do these things with anyone else, because no one else cheated on her mother. Logan's problem isn't your daughter following him, it's that he is oblivious to the fact that he needs to earn her trust, as well as yours.\n\nWhy your 17 year old daughter is in the middle of this, says nothing flattering about either you or Logan.\n\nETA- NTA. He's an AH for demanding she be punished for his past history.", "NTA. Logan cheated on you. That's the ultimate betrayal of trust, and he should count himself lucky that you gave him a second chance in the first place.  \n\nPerhaps he needs a reminder of that? \n\nYour daughter did what anyone who gave half a damn about their mother would in her situation \u2014 she tried to protect you.", "NTA\n\nExcuse me, but he's putting this on the child when his own actions in the past made him untrustworthy? \n\nPerhaps a talk needs to happen with your daughter about safety. But punishing her for trying to look out for her mom is a ridiculous suggestion.  As is saying she's spoiled. Does he think your daughter had fun with this? \n\nHe caused this problem in 2 ways. \n\nOne by cheating in the past and two by not saying hey wife, I'm going out with Betty to help her plan her proposal to Mike.", "Why wasn't he forth coming about going out with his friends girlfriend? That's nothing to hide. You could have been invited. Your imput would be helpful.\nI don't know..this sounds odd. I guess you can wait to see if the proposal goes through. I would keep the pics.", "NTA\n\nThis is the real world and your daughter will report the truth back to her mother. Good job baby girl!!", "Why wasn't Logan up front with you about this?", "NTA. You cheat and then you behave in this manner, you get questioned in a situation like this. There\u2019s a communication issue between the two of you if this is a true story. The real question here is why is your husband out helping another woman in this way and you know nothing of the situation?", "NTA\n\nLogan got away with it this time, but he now knows that he's going to have to be even more careful concealing his affairs.", "NTA your daughter was right to be skeptical, especially if she knew about his history. Your daughter didn\u2019t do it out of ill intention and did it because she\u2019s concerned and looking out for her mom. She shouldn\u2019t be punished for that.", "ESH \n\nYou either trust him or you don't at this point and it seems like you don't and why would you? You should have dumped him when he cheated. \n\nYou said you worked through the infidelity and the marriage has been stronger ever since and yet Logan giving you few details of where he goes and being seen with another woman is enough for you to make him go through his phone to prove nothing is going on. Plus, you approved of your daughter spying on him, because of his history.\n\nHe shouldn't have cheated, you shouldn't have stayed with him.", "Nta\n\n\nHe should earn the truth back from anyone involved if he was caught cheating.\n\nYour daughter clearly never forgave him or trust him. That's on HIM.\n\nAnd him being this sus about it tells me something iffy is going on. Don't believe him.", "Nta. And the fact that he thinks she should be punished for not trusting him says nothing good about his character. He may have regained your trust but he hasn't gained hers and punishing her will not earn her trust or respect. She doesn't owe him a thing. And she did nothing wrong.\nShe didn't hack his computer or open his phone. She literally saw him in a public place with another woman and it set off alarm bells. She didn't confront them or cause a scene. She documented it and informed you. She deserves respect  for how she handled it.\nETA. Given his history of cheating he shouldn't be communicating or meeting privately with any other non bloodrelated women ever without discussing it with you FIRST no matter how innocent he thinks it is.", "NTA. Logan's an idiot. If he didn't cheat before, no one would be so suspicious. You daughter was protecting you. Anyone would have done that! \n\nThis has nothing to do with your daughter being spoiled or not ready for the real world. He's trying to divert your attention. \n\nIs he worried that if he does choose to cheat again, he's worried about being caught?", "NTA. I would have done the same thing. Once a cheater, always a cheater.", "NTA.  If I read this correctly, all of this occurred in public places and she didn't widely publish the photos, just showed you.  If she did this to someone truly shady or followed someone onto private property, though, she could put herself in a bad spot.  I don't know that she should be punished, but she does need to understand that this can be risky, depending on the circumstances.", "NTA.  Jenn heard hoofbeats, and expected horses, not zebras.

It's a load of crap. For me, that's the problem with sticking with a cheater, you never trust them again and without trust you don't have a relationship worth having.", "YTA\n\nHow long has it been since he cheated?", "You are either over the infidelity or aren't.

It was a secret to her partner, not to you?", "NTA.\n\nId give her a round of applause if I could. *That* is how you look out for somebody.\n\nShe would have no reason to be suspicious if his past behavior hadn't warranted it in the first place.\n\nEven so...if my mom's hubby was out with a random woman, I would be double checking and verifying just the same.", "NTA when you cheat you lose trust of more then your partner. Your friends and family no longer have reason to trust someone that would cheat on someone they claim to love. \nHe needs to deal with his consequences of  heating and start earning the trust back.", "You set yourself up for failure.  He will cheat again, if he isn\u2019t already.  Once a cheater, always a cheater.", "NTA. That\u2019s what cheaters get, lack of trust.

I'm struggling with all these n t a verdicts. If OP says they worked through the cheating then OP needs to trust him. Or else she's lying about having gotten over it and that their marriage is stronger than ever. Isn't this situation the same as bringing up an 'old' situation during an argument? Which is something that shouldn't happen in a healthy relationship?", "yup, he\u2019s definitely still cheating lol", "Right!?! What about the proposal planning had to be done in person over dinner, that he wasn't fully forthcoming about that couldn't be done via text or phone calls? And why insist on a punishment for the daughter? What did she do wrong here? She took a photo of her Step-dad on a \"date\" with another woman and showed her mom, that's punishment worthy!?!\n\nNone of us trust Logan either!", "Yes! Op, this is ruining her development.", "Indeed, he's really doing his damnedest to villainize the daughter to check her so she won't follow him again.", "Indeed, and given how hard he's pushing for the daughter to be punished so that she won't do it again, it just sounds like he's being shady.", "Communication is a serious problem here."]}
