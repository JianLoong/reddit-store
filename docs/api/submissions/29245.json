No.\n\nBut they don't normally get a reward for listening to me in those situations, whereas they **know** they get to lick the plate after so long as mom and dad are done eating. They're also needy little girls who strongly dislike being actively ignored for an hour or two should they decide to take a bite of something we haven't finished.\n\nHuskies are stubborn, but very intelligent. As long as you reinforce the idea that they'll be bribed for good behavior, and ignored for bad behavior, they're more than capable of learning proper boundaries.\n\nNow huskies escaping is just something that they do. I mean, it's a dog that can normally run over 20 miles *daily* without any real training and *up to 5x that* with training. They're also one of the *most* pack oriented breeds in existence.\n\nThe formula goes:\n\n(Needy, social dog) + (Time alone) + (Insane energy) - (Energy outlet) = Dogs going on adventures or ending up on roofs.\n\nJust take away (Time alone) or add (Energy outlet) and they're wonderful family dogs, who are more than willing to learn tons of tricks and even leave food alone until their owner allows them to go at it.\n\nAs an aside Malamutes are sled dogs like huskies are, but they are **NOT** huskies. That would be like saying a Samoyed is a husky. It's not an unreasonable assumption because they just look like bigger, fluffy all-white huskies, but they are in fact a separate breed. All 3 breeds are sled dogs, but they *are* distinct primarily when looking at size and certain differences in temperament.", "We aren't actually. Malamutes are a different breed than huskies.\n\nAnd the point about where the plate is was never about if the dog could get it, but about training.\n\nFYI, Ive known mals big enough to lick a plate thats still on the table with no trouble. Lol", "At my Thanksgiving dinner there are 2 regular guests who always want to treat the dog because it's a holiday for him too! And he knew (past tense unfortunately) and would sneak under the table and rest his chin on their laps while giving the most piteous \"save me I haven't been fed for a week\" looks.\n\nI've found that making this general announcement did the trick:\n\n1. The dog is getting his own special treat (basically turkey meat and plain yams) on his dinner\n\n2. Anyone who feeds scraps is on dog poop cleanup duty and it will not be pretty\n\n3. You will be expected to pay the vet bill for the pancreatitis attack that ensues if he is given excess rich food", "We do not give our cats people food. Never have. Yet one cat will grab it out of our mouth given the opportunity. She will be stealing from your plate if you turn around for 2 seconds or licking milk out of your cup (again, no milk allowed). We have to lock her out of the room any time we eat or drink ANYTHING. Yet if a piece of fragrant steak or even a piece of her own food falls onto the floor while you are scooping it into her dish (while she is screaming her head off impatiently for her food) she will not touch it. She will not eat even her favourite food off the floor. She may be a glutton, but she has standards!", "It is completely possible to know, but most don't. Unless OPs girlfriend exclusively prepares pet friendly food, she shouldn't be letting the dog lick off her plate either.\n\nBut yes, this is not the topic of the original question.

If you're having puzza every bight, then yeah that might be an issue. For both of you. Lol\n\nThere are also plenty of \"human foods\" that are healthy to give dogs.\n\nOne study showed that adding green veg to your dogs usual food daily reduces the risk of some cancers by up to 90%.\n\n\"Dog food\" wasnt even a thing until the 1900s. All they ate was table scraps and probably some small prey they hunted. Dont get me wrong, im not advocating for that specifically.\n\nBut some \"human food\" or table scraps - appropriately portioned for their body size - is fine. Even daily. Depending on what you're eating.

If people can't respect my reasonable boundaries with my dog, I either manage the situation to prevent those situations or I don't bring my dog into those environments. \n\nI'm more than happy to let other people help me treat toss during the meal or otherwise participate in thanksgiving puppy fun, and I haven't gotten any complaints.

You're giving your pets a couple of teaspoons per week of stuff that could harm or kill them. Unless you never eat garlic, onions, butter, oil, or anything that could harm them, which I doubt is the case. I love my pets too much to give them harmful food in any amount but you do you I guess.

I said most vegetables were fine and even good for dogs. The whole point is that they don't need table scraps if you feed them a balanced diet. I give my dogs squash, carrots, peas, beans and lots of other fresh or cooked vegetables as a treat, but that's not the same as giving them processed or \"human\" foods.

Garlic actually has good health benefits when consumed at a proper dose.  Many, many dogs can consume small amounts of substances that may be poisonous with no issues and no long term health issues.  Lots of dog foods and treats use garlic in them, do you really think these companies would use garlic if every dog that are the products got poisoned or died?  Have you ever worked veterinary?  I have spent nearly 18 years working with animals and pets and have yet to see a dog die from consuming garlic, even what would be considered larger amounts.
