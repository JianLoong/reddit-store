I could tell it was hurting my wife, so I tried to start a conversation to include her but it always went back to my sister and my SIL\u2019s baby. I even tried talking about the gender reveal we are holding soon, but no one seemed to care. My wife got upset and walked out of the room. My sister asked me if everything was okay, and I told her that my wife was upset because she\u2019s feeling left out. My SIL apologized and said that that wasn\u2019t her intention. My mom tried to convince my wife to come back and sit down, but she refused.

My grandma told me that she would be more than happy to discuss both pregnancies, but it was too late. My wife wanted to leave, so that\u2019s what we did. \n\nI\u2019m now being called an asshole by my parents for making a scene with my grandparents there.
