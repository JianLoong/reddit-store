I would feel horrible if we went the whole evening and didn't acknowledge  her or even my other cousin who isn't pregnant but whose little boy turns two soon. \n\nThe point is, your wife is alright to feel a little left out, and you're alright to tell your family when they asked. It didn't sound like you threw a tantrum or anything,  just camly explained how your wife felt and then camly left.", "I\u2019ve always wanted a baby. You realize how upsetting it is every year that goes by and there\u2019s a new pregnancy announced for me? Can only imagine for your sister - she has to pay thousands to get inseminated just to have a chance of having a baby. Can your wife not get upset? It\u2019s actually very rare for a couple to be able to afford IVF and have a successful pregnancy at the same time. Be happy about that for her. If you were my brother, I wouldn\u2019t want to be around you ever again", "This is their first baby and she\u2019s 38 weeks, obviously this is an exciting time. \n\nI\u2019m sure your wife got a lot of attention during her first pregnancy and especially near the end.

It almost sounds like they did it on purpose and I totally understand why you and your wife feel the way that you do. \n\nAfter your family was made aware of both of your feelings, instead of gaslighting you, they should have at least apologized instead of gaslit you both and made themselves out to be the victims. \n\nSurround yourselves with people who love and support you, not a bunch of AH who make you feel small.

YTA! \n\nNot your wife, JUST you. Your wife is valid in feeling a bit left out. I won\u2019t judge a pregnant woman for feeling pushed aside when she\u2019s overlooked during pregnancy conversations. You, however, are acting like your sister is intentionally stealing the spotlight. This is HER first pregnancy. An IVF pregnancy mind you. She deserves the same attention your wife got her first pregnancy. She\u2019s also due at any moment now so of course she is the main focus! You seriously shamed a pregnant woman because her mother and grandmother are excited for her???? Get over yourself. You\u2019re an AH and you owe your sister and her wife an apology for acting like a spoiled child. Do you also get jealous when you don\u2019t get to blow out the candles at other people\u2019s birthday parties? \n\nSide note: I\u2019m currently pregnant w/ baby #2 and folks just aren\u2019t as excited the second time around. Folks also includes me lol. This ain\u2019t our first rodeo so when I found out one of my friends is pregnant with her first, I jumped with joy for her! I see her a couple of times a week because she\u2019s a client where I work and I ask her how she\u2019s doing every time. I let her take center stage when others ask about our pregnancies. I\u2019ve had my moment in the sun with my first pregnancy and thoroughly enjoy seeing her beam from the attention. It\u2019s such a special time the first time around.\n\nEditing this to a softer YTA. Although I still believe OP could have communicated his feelings in a better manner, he\u2019s entitled to his feelings. It\u2019s normal to feel a little left out and pushed aside. I just think his anger was directed towards the wrong person, his sister, and his wife needs to be okay with not being the main focus this time around. Let sister have the attention. It\u2019s her first child and she\u2019s due any moment. If it is really that upsetting, learn to talk with your family about it rather than being rude to your pregnant sister.", "Yeah I was thinking the same.  It's OP's second round with his second baby.  His sister is about to give a birth to her first baby VERY VERY SOON, FFS!\n\nTo OP\n\nYTA....Get over it.  You have long way to get to the end of your wife's pregnancy.  Right now it is just beginning.....even it is second pregnancy as well. Let your sister have her glory time because time is getting closer to the special event.  Yours will come in SEVERAL more. months.  FFS, get over it.  Your wife needs to get over it, too.  Seriously......", "this is a good point, besides there\u2019s not much for other people to talk about at 14 weeks. mostly just the moms symptoms. not to diminish what pregnancy is like in the first trimester at all! \n\neta: and op was only trying to talk about the gender reveal lol, \u201cwere not telling you the gender but let\u2019s have a conversation about what you think it will be\u201d oh wait there\u2019s only two options and that conversation will end before it starts", "As someone who has experienced multiple miscarriages this one hurts to hear.", "Exactly this,and his wife needs to grow up.

The thing that caught my attenention was that they were making a big thing about the sisters baby being the first great granddaughter. I don\u2019t know why that stuck out to me. I have to wonder if there was as much attention thrown on the birth of OPs son? He doesn\u2019t really say how they were when his son was born. I feel like I\u2019m missing something here because the way this reads I don\u2019t blame OPs wife for feeling excluded and hurt and I don\u2019t fault OP for sticking up for his hurt wife. So I kinda feel like ESH since the visit was supposed to be for both OP and his sister, and yet it seems like all the focus was on the sister. I get the sister\u2019s birth is imminent, but if you don\u2019t visit often shouldn\u2019t the visit talk about what\u2019s new with everyone in attendance? People are acting like OP and his wife were trying to steal the sister\u2019s thunder because she\u2019s almost due and had to use IVF to get pregnant (not sure why that matters so much), and I feel like OP and his wife were just trying to be included and share the news of their life too.\n\nEdit: Thank you for explaining why everyone is focusing on the IVF. Even with the explanation it doesn\u2019t take away my opinion that ESH because OP and his wife we effectively being ignored during a visit that was supposed to be so everyone could catch up. Which seemingly doesn\u2019t happen often.", "Thank you for sharing this!!! That attention OP\u2019s sister and SIL are getting is definitely well placed. Their happiness should be celebrated. I\u2019ve watched friends struggle with fertility and other go through IVF. Their pregnancy journeys are starkly different than mine. I will always gladly shower them in the love and attention they deserve when discussing their journey, pregnancies, etc. They deserve to talk about their experience without me trying to cut in and make things about me. \n\n\nCongratulations to you and your wife on your family.  IVF babies truly are miracles \ud83d\udc96", "Exactly! IVF is a long, difficult process. It\u2019s incredible that OP\u2019s sister and SIL seem to have such a loving, supportive relationship with the family. Honestly, I\u2019m thrilled for them that even the grandparents are excited. This might not be the case with SILs family. Plus, 38 weeks? Yeah, that baby could come any time now. So of course they\u2019re more excited.", "i agree with your comment but is it not typical to have a baby shower for a not-first child? maybe it's just my family but we have a baby shower for every child lol. i guess maybe it depends on the intent? cuz in my family baby showers are more for celebrating the upcoming baby then for anything else", "Yes, she saw them at the beginning of her pregnancy when she announced it to all of us. No one knew they were going through the IVF process, so we were all surprised.", "Most likely! Which is probably why it hurts more now that someone else in the family is having their first child and now they\u2019re center stage. Second pregnancies just aren\u2019t as exciting. I know because I\u2019m currently pregnant with my second. However, I would never expect others to fuss over me the same way they would if my sister was pregnant with her first kid. I would also be excitedly gushing over my sister having her first baby because that\u2019s my sister and my nibling!", "Exactly \ud83d\udcaf, way to spoil for his sister.\n\nHis sister will remember that the brother and sil were acting childish when it came to her turn.", "You forget something, they rarely see their grandparents", "Even the mom who popularized the trend of gender reveal parties thinks they're stupid now, lol.", "I am\u2026on the fence about gender reveal parties.\n\nI think it would be cute as heck for parents to use them to celebrate their children who come out as whatever gender whenever they come out (at least initially). But more like a cool birthday party!", "Just pointing out that they are not a thing worldwide. Seems to be mainly a US idea.", "I'm betting the wife won't want the sister at the gender reveal just incase. I hope she goes to the party and goes into labour there. Gender parties are so tacky.", "I think she was just hurt that no one seemed to care about our baby as much as our sister\u2019s.", "Maybe they are tired of apologising to these 2.\n\nOp and his wife sound like they have main character syndrome.   \n\nThey can't bear for anyone else to have the spotlight.", "Grandchild = grandchild. Why shouldn\u2019t it be equal?", "Pregnancy is not an excuse to act like a child.", "Quite frankly, delivering in two weeks, your first, gets more attention than delivering in 26 weeks, even if also your first. One birth is imminent, so it ends up being the focus of conversation. After that baby is born, there will be some focus on the newborn, but then the focus will be on the next imminent birth.", "Completely agree, we shouldn't give passes to every person who has \"feelings\" about being included or excluded or hurt or not recognized or blah blah blah. Causing family drama because you are annoyed is ridiculous. You want to be included, so you throw a tantrum? That's what a 5 year old does.", "You don\u2019t know that this hasn\u2019t happened every single time. Maybe there\u2019s been a long history of OP\u2019s wife being sidelined?", "They apologized after multiple (multiple) attempts by OP to include his wife in the conversation and was ignored and brushed aside for his trouble.  They only cut the shit after his wife walked out of the room and said enough.  No it shouldn\u2019t be all about them, but it would be hurtful to be sitting there listening to an hour or more of \u201cisn\u2019t it so wonderful that this other pregnancy is going on?\u201d While my own was being ignored.", "Why does dismiss mean they did it purposefully?", "No, SIL apologised. Sister doubled down and said \u201cnot everything is about OP\u2019s wife\u201d. I\u2019m getting golden child vibes here.", "I know, the wife is a brat", "The IVF bit matters because it\u2019s a very difficult process (mentally, physically, financially) and OP has said his sister had a lot of difficulty getting pregnant. It adds to the excitement that this was able to happen for them against difficult odds.", "It being IVF matters very very much. Having an accidental baby (even just via \u201cwe aren\u2019t actively trying not to have a baby\u201d) or carefully using family planning is a shit ton easier than having a baby via IVF. And a LOT more cost effective.\n\nThere\u2019s constant monitoring, pills, shots, vaginal suppositories, planning, calling off or taking off work with (hopefully) a two day notice, contacting your IVF clinic and if it\u2019s remote your monitoring clinic, following orders, getting updates and redoing all your medications (which btw are very exacting) every time a new order happens.\n\nOh and the monitoring involves blood work AT LEAST weekly if not more frequently, and vaginal ultrasounds as you go along. And that\u2019s all just after the embryo/s exist. It\u2019s even worse whenever you are growing the eggs to make the embryos and you have zero control over how many or the quality of the embryos you get. And if you get no good ones, you start all over again.\n\nAnd if your embryo fails, you start all over again.\n\nIVF is hard. Making babies the old fashioned way is comparatively easy and OP is TA.", "It could be because the sister's baby is 4th generation of girl (matri-lineal) and so they are more excited. I'm assuming they are maternal GPs.", "Who says they weren\u2019t equally as excited to find out OP was having a boy? I had a boy for my first and most of out family are crossing their fingers and toes that the baby I\u2019m currently carrying is a girl. Not because they don\u2019t want a boy, but it\u2019s exciting to have one of each. This isn\u2019t an uncommon occurrence. Should I end up having a boy they will love him the same as if I had a girl.", "OP and his wife were likely showered with attention and excitement when they had their first child too. This is their second, and they aren\u2019t even close to giving birth yet, unlike sister and SIL. Their unbalanced attention is more than justified. Imagine thinking that at 14 weeks, your pregnancy deserves just as much attention as someone at 38 weeks.", "That crossed my mind too. I was also thinking that being the in-law may have made her more sensitive and/or insecure.", "This. I think this is a bigger factor than what\u2019s been mentioned in the comments. OP\u2019s sister is their biological granddaughter, their once-grand-baby who they presumably held in their arms as a newborn, and is now about to birth her own. Conversely, OP isn\u2019t the one to carry and birth a baby, so they haven\u2019t yet experienced one of their own babies give birth. OP\u2019s wife was never their grand baby. That may be harsh to point out, but there is understandably enormous excitement about the physical pregnancy of one\u2019s own progeny. And like everyone said, doesn\u2019t mean their babies won\u2019t be loved just the same once they\u2019re all born. It\u2019s too bad the wife\u2019s feelings got hurt, and that\u2019s completely understandable. It\u2019s possible to be happy for others even when we\u2019re down. Let them have their moment.", "I don't think it has much to do with being blood or in laws because it is still their grandson/son's baby im fairly sure it's just because she's giving birth soon and it will be a first great granddaughter which is exciting and also because it's their first not second", "Typically you don\u2019t have a baby shower for consecutive babies because you use the gifts from the first one for both.", "I hardly hear of baby showers for second and third children. Only time I\u2019ve seen it happen is when there\u2019s a large age gap (8+ years) between children.", "Here it's not common to have a 2nd baby shower unless there's a huge age gap or it's a different relationship.", "In the current climate. That is, after covid, many many people are having baby showers for their second babies because they couldn\u2019t have one for their first. Because of lockdown we had a drive by shower. So basically people sent gifts, we didn\u2019t get to see anyone. Now we\u2019re having a baby shower with our second, we don\u2019t expect any gifts but we want to celebrate this with our friends and family.", "I was pregnant with my third at the same time my sister was pregnant with her first. I think the only time the pregnancy talk was focused on me was when I announced (before sister was pregnant) and when I have birth. That was fine with me, I was too busy chasing my toddlers at family events anyway, also I was happy for my sister.", "No I didn\u2019t. Wife still has 6-7 months for them to see grandparents, sister is due literally any second. 6-7 months where they can plan just as well as the grandparents for another trip or invite them to the gender reveal/baby shower vs literally giving birth any second. Sister doesn\u2019t have the same time period and it\u2019s her first baby while wife already got loved on, dotted over, and all the first! Sister no this is her first everything is new and she had to go through IVF a very invasive, and expensive procedure to have a baby. The grandparents aren\u2019t saying they\u2019re any less special and even offered to include the wife to smooth things over. Wife and OP refused and walked out on the visit. If it was so important for him to spend time with his grandparents he never gets to see they could have easily talked it over as adults and continued on. \n\nThere\u2019s 100% a way for them to talk about both pregnancies. OP could have simply waited for the conversation about sister to come to a close and bring up the gender reveal bringing the conversation around to his wife, also opening an opportunity for the grandparents to perhaps plan to even be there for said gender reveal. Op said himself his wife hasn\u2019t been shoved to the side by his family or treated badly or even was ignored her first pregnancy it just wasn\u2019t about her at the time. It\u2019s really exciting when you\u2019re that close to giving birth vs again 6-7 months away from giving birth.", "You have to see that she is due any day now with THEIR FIRST baby.\nYou guys already had this fawning over your first and currently are so early in the pregnancy you don't even know the gender.\n\n Is it wrong for your sister and wife to experience what you both did with your first? \nImagine if when you both started the little hissy fit if everyone stopped their initial talk of the soon to arrive baby to say \"Sorry how's the morning sickness? Hope it's not as bad this time around\" there isn't currently much to fawn over at 14 weeks of a 2nd child.", "Because it wasn\u2019t a question of \u201cdo we love OP\u2019s child more than OP\u2019s sister\u2019s child?\u201d That\u2019s grandchild = grandchild. Your wife having her second baby months from now is not the same as your sister, having her first, through IVF which is mentally and physically draining before even getting pregnant, any day now. Pregnant woman with first child through IVF due any day =/= Pregnant woman with second child due months from now. Your wife got to have the spotlight 100% on her with her first pregnancy. Why be a brat about not being the center of attention right now? I can almost guarantee when she gets closer to her due date, the spotlight will be back on her. \n\nY\u2019all have to have bigger problems than this. YTA. Both of you.", "This is your second child. It\u2019s literally just a sprinkle. You\u2019re not the center of attention, and you have to respect that. Once you have your first and keep having kids, it\u2019s not going to be the focal point.", "People will be excited, but when it comes to others for their first, you will always take the backseat. Harsh reality and the honest one.", "Also I know from watching with family, baby showers less and less family will show up after the first. Because they came to the first one and brought stuff. The second/third/fourth/etc, only new people yoj know will bring big stuff, others that have been there will bring diapers, formula (if requested) just small things. Don\u2019t expect the same thing from your first baby shower. From the way this is going from no one fawning over 14 weeks I don\u2019t want you guys to be upset over an outcome or a baby shower", "All I heard while reading OPs post was \u201cMarsha! Marsha! Marsha!\u201d *storms off and slams door.", "OP actually stated that his parents treat his wife like she\u2019s a daughter and they treated her first pregnancy the with the same excitement as they\u2019re now treating his sisters. \n\nI think OP and his wife need to allow his sister and SIL to be showered with the attention that him and his wife already received. I get that it may hurt that the second pregnancy isn\u2019t as over the moon exciting as the first. But why take take that away from his sister? She\u2019s just as deserving of that attention. \n\nI just find it strange that two grown adults feel they should equally be the center of attention in a conversation that isn\u2019t about them at the moment. Sometimes you\u2019re just not the main topic\u2026 get over it. \nThe wife will have her time when she\u2019s about to give birth too.", "Couldn\u2019t his wife also just have included herself in the conversation by contributing excitement for them and engaging? Instead they tried to steer the convo to something completely OP/wife based (their gender reveal) - they werent trying to share the attention, they were trying to take it.", "Again, none of that was active dismissal, and when called out they acknowledged the mistake and tried to fix it. And like everyone's saying, the lady having her first baby that's literally about to pop outta her is just going to get more attention than someone who is having her second months and months from now. Wife's not an AH for being upset but OP and her are for not accepting that in this instance maybe it just wasn't about him and her and maybe they should have been able to muster up some joy for the other couple themselves.", "Or, OP was very bad in trying to shift conversation, or does it all the time, even before the pregnancy.\n\nGM: \"I can't wait to meet my first granddaughter\"\n\n38w: \"Oh that's so sweet, I do hope delivery goes smooth I am a bit anxious.\"\n\nOP: \"So yeah we're going to do this wonderful gender reveal which will be very exciting for you!\" ( Ps: op is also having a girl and he and his wife are pissed they're not getting the first granddaughter excitement)\n\nMom: \"Oh don't worry dear, there will be medical person there to support you!\"", "Yes. I agreed with all that.", "I\u2019m saying that if everything else was equal between my sibling and my pregnancy, and my sibling received more attention than I did because they were carrying the first boy, while I had another girl, I\u2019d be upset.", "Or twins. If an expectant mom suddenly needs two of everything, a shower for the second kids is not out of line.", "Look, on a human level, can I understand being upset that I\u2019m not the center of attention even though I\u2019m pregnant too? Sure can. But that\u2019s why we have thoughts that stay in our heads and don\u2019t always need to be said out loud. You guys actually said out loud \u201cpay equal attention to me\u201d and your family was gracious enough to do so. Your wife just decided to walk out.", "That\u2019s how I feel. Also, why can\u2019t OP get excited and engage in the conversation about his own sister who is about to give birth to his niece? \n\nThe conversation could have naturally shifted over to talking about his wife and her pregnancy if she hadn\u2019t stormed off and locked herself away. Maybe the conversation didn\u2019t shift to his wife because the family wasn\u2019t just done discussing OPs sister yet.", "I'm also wondering why there was no \"we're both pregnant!\" bonding/conversation happening.  Maybe more info is needed.", "Well sure but that\u2019s not the point tho is it? If you were 9000 years old would you be excited more for two boys or a girl after a boy?", "Or rich people.", "Wtf... you didn't even need to come here to find out you are the AH.... You should have already known the answer to your question.... yes you are a MAJOR AH", "YTA and side note why are we still doing gender reveals? Nobody wants to go to those things", "After having read through the comments and seeing you\u2019re having the gender reveal the day after her due date - there\u2019s more going on here and you\u2019re about to alienate your family.

Your sister is near birth; while your wife isn\u2019t.", "YTA. If your wife and you are feeling left out maybe you should direct your ire towards your grandparents, not your sister and SIL who are just about to have their first child. Your words, your wife is at Week 14, you'll get your time in the spotlight. \n\nPlease do correct me if I'm wrong but didn't your family (rightfully) focus on your wife when your was expecting your first?

Because then I'm kinda at a loss for words.", "NTA - i think OP isn\u2019t the asshole he just didn\u2019t correctly handle the situation. \ni think the wife gets a pass because we don\u2019t know her personality and she\u2019s allowed to be upset because she\u2019s pregnant which means her hormones are all over the place. and the comments are saying that the focus should be on the sister cause she had to go through IVF (which is very hard process) and shes about to give birth soon (which are both taxing things) so ofc her getting extra attention makes sense, but shutting them out cause its OP\u2019s second baby and they were lucky enough to be able to have their baby naturally, isn\u2019t kind either. I also understand OP\u2019s wife not wanting to come back to the conversation cause like what\u2019s the point now? when they tried earlier they got shut down so now its just talking to them to keep peace which would personally leave a bad taste in my mouth. i think OP\u2019s wife was just feeling a bit left out and hormonal and since the grandparents were there for everyone, everyone should be included. I think OP should definitely apologize to his sister for being so blunt and understand that ofc his sister is going to get a little extra attention right now but that doesn\u2019t mean the OP and wife are assholes, they were just feeling left out. Also idk why but it always irks me when people give a pregnancy less value just because its not their first one, no pregnancy is the same ?? I understand ppl might not like my opinion and that is okay because I understand why. But for me, its not completely black and white.", "ESH they should have included you wife out of courtesy, but that was a grown woman tantrum she threw and it\u2019s not ok.

They aren\u2019t as likely to include their mothers in law in their close circle, and their husbands rarely try to foster a closer relationship through planning their OWN family events.

Becoming a lesbian or bi moms was a secretive turkey baster and fear of judgement thing.\n\nThe grandparents are of the generation (hell, I\u2019m 44 and from a conservative Western country so so am I) where to see a same sex pregnancy celebrated by being totally normal everyday baby chat seemed unimagineable. I am queer. I grew up believing parenthood was impossible due to that. Some 34 year old friends have an IVF baby as wife and wife arriving this year and it was gruelling mentally but both of them commented \u2018we can do this without fear of judgement and discrimination and we know it wasn\u2019t like that even a decade ago.\u2019\n\nI don\u2019t want kids but a lot of their older LGBTQ+ friends have found it bittersweet. All are thrilled but many have grief that parenthood was not open to them without a LOT AND I MEAN A LOT of money due to the prejudice. It\u2019s still not for marginalised LGBTQ+ people. That community has a lot of pain around this subject.\n\nSo the sister and wife are 38 weeks and could literally break waters mid chat, but they are also a living example of 40 years of gay rights activism and campaigning highlighting social change across the grandparents\u2019 lives. That is in itself a big deal. Marriage and babies are still not a secure or legal right to LGBTQ+ people even in developed countries. My home country legalised same sex marriage in 2020 after collapsing its Parliament for almost 4 years in protest. The land of gay cake\u2026\n\nIt is not special treatment for LGBTQ+ people to have the specifics of their pregnancy or marriage acknowledged when they are still not approved of by so many. It is allyship. It is also appropriate to acknowledge the extra steps and strength of hetero IVF because those are different pregnancy journeys. Same as natural conception but hyperemesis or bedrest hard pregnancies. You acknowledge all facets while they are still pregnant because once the baby arrives, people often don\u2019t want to dwell on the marathon before.

Then I had surgery, where a needle was repeatedly inserted into my nether region to extract eggs 1 at a time.  Then I had to recover from that, wait a bit (I have endometriosis, so needed a month of pseudo menopause), then do the FET cycle, which involved a month of hormone medication and intramuscular injections to get to implant an embryo, at which point I continued injections and hormones until 10 weeks.  \n\nThat's just to get pregnant.
