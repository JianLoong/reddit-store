A developer bought the apartment he was renting and he was supposed to temporarily live with us as he found a new place.\n\nThe thing is that he paid the downpayment on our current place as our wedding gift.  I currently pay the mortgage, and my wife contributes to the bills.  The house is under my name only.\n\nSome of the reasons I want him to move out are that he doesn't respect our space (then plays dumb about it), and he also never cleans up after himself.\n\nFor example, I used to do the laundry at the house, but when my dad moved in, he'd \"borrow\" my work shirts from the laundry without asking.  He'd claim that he didn't know they were mine.  I then started having my laundry sent out.  He'd borrow them from the closet and then still claim that he \"didn't know\".\n\nHe used to open my mail and claim \"he didn't know\" it was my mail.  So, I started going paperless with a lot of stuff and had a PO Box opened so that my stuff could go there.  He got angry about it and said that I just need to trust him.  He claimed that it was just an honest mistake and that I shouldn't have to keep secrets.  Strange, he somehow always remembers to put the junk mail to one side and give it to me, but if I ever have to get a physical check in the mail, he somehow \"doesn't know\".\n\nThen there's the whole thing where he complains about nearly everything I do.  Got new kitchen cabinets but in?  They're so obtrusive.  Want to hang a painting?  He'll take it down the next day because he doesn't want a hole in \"his\" wall.  Have some friends over?  He complained about us speaking a language that he doesn't understand.\n\nMy wife thinks that I should maybe just chill out, or at least do more legwork to get him the apartment.  Truth be told, I tried that, but my dad is so dug in at this point that he refuses to move.  It's also considered somewhat of \"the right thing to do\" in my culture to let your parents stay at your place.\n\nTechnically speaking, *we* could move, and let my dad continue to live there.  I have an investment property in a different part of town, but that would mean losing out on the income that we get from renting it out, and a longer commute for my wife.

Tell him no more \"I  don't know,\" no more stealing your mail, etc. and clean up after himself. Tell him he needs to respect your boundaries or he needs to move out and you won't be paying his rent.\n\nHe gave you a gift of a down-payment. That's great, but doesn't entitle him to mooch off you forever. It was a gift - which means no strings should be attached.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like for your own sake you need to have him move out. You deserve your own privacy and peace in your own home.", "No NTA but why would you have to pay for his rent when he leaves. Does he not work?", "NTA and if you can afford to do it, paying his rent sounds like a small price in exchange for complete control over *your* space. I'd give him a firm deadline verbally and in writing for move out, find him an apartment while reminding him of the deadline as it gets closer, then move him out.", "YWNBTA He sounds annoying as hell. It is normal for a couple to want to live on their own without intrusive relatives.", "Does your dad not work?  How old is he?  Can he get on a list for senior housing?", "NTA. He's being sketchy, opening your mail and then getting weird when you got a PO Box because he opened your mail. You don't owe him a place to stay, even if he gifted you the downpayment (that was a gift, and true gifts should not come with such strings attached). Give him a timeline and offer to help him find another place.", "Yes, OP. Move\u2026 and then *sell the place*.

If he doesn't have the means to financially care for himself, that would help if he's fiscally responsible. It would set you and your wife back, but if you have an investment property then you should be okay.", "NTA. It's understandable that you wouldn't want to live with your father.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are going to have to be more assertive and tell him that the time has come for him to find a place to live, and he needs to be out by such and such date 90 days from now, and you will help him find a place, and in fact have set up some tours this weekend for him to check out. See if you can find an over 55 place so he can make some friends. And whatever you do, do NOT offer to pay for it or put your name on the lease.", "NTA\n\nCulture or not, he\u2019s taking advantage of you.

Dad did something nice for you guys, but unfortunately it seems like at a time of his life where either he couldn't afford it, OR the down payment was just a pretext to get him in the door and he was planning to stay the rest of his life being taken care of by his children in his old age. Sounds like it's kind of expected in your culture. If you want him out(and YWNBTA for that), seems like the cleanest way would be to sell your current apartment and give dad his down payment back to set up his own place. Good luck...", "NTA \nCan you create a separate place within your house that has its own bathroom, kitchenette etc so he\u2019s there but separate?", "This isnt so much a \"Who is the AH?\" situation as a no win situation. You are culturally bound to provide for your father. And he is making the most of it. Kick him out and you are the AH. Let him stay and things will boil over and you will become the AH. Move him into your income property and you will still be the AH but with less money. There is no path forward that does not pan out as a losing situation for you. \n\nThe move with the PO Box was a good one. Its a passive fix so you cant be actively faulted for it, even though Dad is trying to do so. Try to think of similar \"fixes\". Because your choices right now seem to be either kick him out or learn to live with him. Its up to you to decide which will cause you the most grief. Until he does something to disrespect or harm your wife she will not be in favor of a forced move. I would try a serious, heart to heart talk with your house rules laid out and put on paper. If he wants to stay, he follows your rules. If he doesnt want to follow your rules, he has to leave. Very simple. Good luck to you, friend.", "NTA. Would you be able to give him the amount that he paid towards your place? That should clear up his apparent confusion about whose place it is and give him enough to move out and pay his own rent.", "NTA. Start the process of legal eviction. Dad is an adult and can pay for a place on his own. If that means he has to find a roommate, well, therm\u2019s the breaks, now that he\u2019s gotten settled into leeching off you and your wife instead of actually looking for a place.", "NTA", "He's retired.", "He's been retired for over 10 years.  Senior housing isn't really available in my country.  \n\nMost old people live with their families here, and some live alone.", "That doesn't mean he's your problem to pay for.", "NTA. It doesn't matter that he paid the downpayment. You've let him stay with you and now he's abusing it by using your laundry, reading your mail, etc. You should not move. He should. Give him a date he needs to go by, say in 30 days, and then enforce it.", "Nta evict him", "NTA  You are trapped unless you make a plan.  I would sell the place you are living in and give him back his down payment, so he can find his own place.  You may have to temporarily live in your investment property until you put together a down payment or maybe you have enough equity in your house to buy a one bedroom that has no space for him.  \n\nIf he was a reasonable person, then I would say go with your country's traditions.  He is not.  Old traditions are just that.  Don't be bound by them just like you wouldn't consider the tradition of hand washing your clothes in the river rather than using a washing machine.", "NTA. House is in your name. Eviction notice. 30 days and the leech is gone. Don't help him find a new place and certainly don't pay for it for him. If I were you, I'd cut contact once he's out of your door.", "NTA", "Sounds like Dad intended to live with you which is why he gave you the down payment. He feels like it\u2019s his house, not yours. Unless you\u2019re willing to stand up for yourself, you\u2019re stuck with him. I\u2019d sell that place and use some of the money to get him his own place. He\u2019s not going to improve or change as you already know.", "NTA. You don't have to pay his rent, btw. Cut him a check for the downpayment and be done with it. He's making you uncomfortable in your own home and is taking over. Stand up for yourself and kick him out.", "NTA.    Give him an eviction notice and tell him you've paid the sum he gifted for the downpayment by letting him live rent free (assuming it's equitable, if not, set up a payment plan that will pay off the 'balance').", "I think he's going through your mail to find out your income and where and on what it's being spent, coupled with complaints about what you are spending your money on, to me these are tell tale signs that he's planning something, something with your money or identity. He's just in the planning stages right now. Or just a simple old control freak.", "NTA", "NTA if like you say it I part of your culture to house parents then it is time to build a 'granny annex' or whatever they are call d in your country. That way he can be king of the castle in his annex and leave the main house to you guys.", "NTA.  For your own peace of mind you have got to get him out of there before it gets any worse.", "NTA are you sure his last place ended the way he says it did? Sounds like he gave you the money so he could move in and have a claim to it. I\u2019d sit him down and say these are the rules, follow them or leave. I\u2019d also get it in writing as a lease of sorts so it\u2019s easier to evict him if the need arises. If he flat out refuses, give him a move out date. I like what other people are saying about selling, giving him back his \u201cshare\u201d and then buying new without him.", "NTA. \n\ntell him to move out and pay for his own bills. \n\nTell him straightup that its time for him to move out and that you won't be giving him any money. \n\nCan you imagine how hell treat you if you two, decide to have kids. Hell micromanage everything and act as if he's the parent and not you. \n\nYou need to kick him out today and refuse to give him any money. \n\nScrew culture. Hes a grown ads adult and is more than capable of taking care of himself. \n\nIts time for him to move out.", "Just because he\u2019s retired doesn\u2019t mean he gets to gaslight you in your own home. NTA. Give him 30 days notice.", "Would it be possible to sell this place and find a new one that has something like a guest house or tiny home on the same property? I understand if culturally it's the norm to take in elderly parents, but having some physical boundaries while still keeping him nearby might help."]}
