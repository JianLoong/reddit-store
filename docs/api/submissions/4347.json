Now he told me that it'd be nice if we invite her to christmas dinner with us since she has no family and other friends are busy. I refused but he insisted saying it'd mean so much to her especially since this is her first christmas without her husband and we should comfort her. I refused and said that it's supposed to be a family celebration and my family will show up so there's enough amount of guests already but he said she the one who needs this family atmesphere the most. I snapped and firmly told him I will not agree to let him invite her to christmas dinner with us and he needed to drop it cause it made me uncomfortable.\n\nHe argued then started sulking about it saying that I was being cruel for no reason and that he wasn't asking for much. just an extra chair/plate for her.

You skirt around it, but it's clear that the real issue here is that you are uncomfortable that your husband is around her so much and doing things for her. You may not think anything suspicious is going on, and probably nothing is, but it IS making you uncomfortable. Your post screams that.\n\nTry to be honest with yourself. Get those feelings out on the table to look at. Are you uncomfortable because you see him doing chores for her, but not at home? Are there other red flags, like past behavior? Maybe things feel unbalanced and you can't put a finger on it. It's ok to acknowledge that and talk it out.\n\nNow let's address Christmas. It's highly unlikely that he would bring a potential affair partner to a family dinner. And he's not keeping you from her. It might be a really good opportunity to get closer to her, especially if she needs friends right now. \n\nI'm going with NAH (probably), but maybe work on addressing your feelings, even if you don't like them.

Why exactly does she have no one else to turn to other than your husband? She has no other friends or family? Something seems off.\n\n*Edit*\n\nAfter reading all these comments, I want to add that personally, my family would absolutely roast me if they showed up to Christmas and my husband invited another woman unrelated to him. Every single one of my family members would be super suspect of the entire situation. I'm not saying either of them are intentionally planning on eloping behind your back, but two straight members of the opposite sex leaning on each other during a time of shared grief, and spending time together without you, is a huge set up for failure in my opinion.

If this is more of an issue with you being jealous of the time that he is spending with her, then maybe YTA.\n\nPersonally, I would just have her over... thinking people being alone on Xmas is very sad to me personally, and it doesn't seem like a huge deal if it is just one person.", "INFO: What\u2019s your problem with the widow?", "YTA\n\nYour husband is grieving too and trying to honour his friend. \n\nIf she has a better option, she'll take it...\n\nBut imagine if she doesn't?

Erm, you're busy too, but why does that not matter?  Her actual friend's plans are to be respected, but yours, when you and she are not close and when you're family are coming, are to be ignored?  That's weird to me, and this reeks of overstepping boundaries you've said you're not comfortable with.\n\nIf she has no close friends then that's sad, but also, why not?  No-one is anyone else's responsibility like that, and whilst you should of course be kind and helpful, you don't have to accommodate someone if it will make you uncomfortable.  Has she tried to be your friend in the months since her husband passed?  Have you made an effort?  Had you already decided you don't like her?  I think you should reach out and try to be friends, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't have your family Xmas.  And there is definitely a conversation to be had with your husband about boundaries, jealousy, and feelings.", "YTA. You come across as very cold. I agree with your husband that an extra plate/chair won't put you out that much and it's CHRISTMAS. This woman has gone through a traumatic event and your husband wants to extend to her a little kindness, why is that so offputting for you? It will only be awkward if you and your family make it so; is it really so difficiult for you all to be welcoming to another human?\n\nJeez. Be nicer?\n\nOr be honest and admit you're jealous of the attention this woman is getting.\n\nETA: Over the years we've invited plenty of distant family members, friends, coworkers to holiday events so they wouldn't be alone.

For those who oppose me think about all the weekends she has not had with her husband. She doesn\u2019t have time with him but like any person still wants to know that she is his priority In life. Having this family Christmas as would reassure her that he is still there for his family and she is still his priority.", "NTA.  You guys, he's spending ALL of his time off at this woman's house.  Most wives are gunna resent their husband being at another woman's house every time he's off work.  Yes, that's how emotional affairs start.  It's nice he wants to help but the widow is not 100% his responsibility.  Helping out should be contingent on all parties consent.  The guy is obviously shirking his husbandly duties to his wife.  If he continues then he wont have a wife anymore.", "Idk\u2026 you\u2019ve been patient and understanding with him spending EVERY weekend with her. I would be getting annoyed and pissed as well. NTA.", "YTA. Your husband sounds like he is truly a compassionate man, and you could really stand fo learn from him. A man that he considered to be his brother is gone. His spouse is also family by extension. Have you really no compassion for your own grieving husband and his friend's wife?\n\nReading things like this makes me extra grateful to have been surrounded by much better people after my own partner passed.", "Not the asshole but I see her side and the husband's. Widow has her own family and can't rely on your husband as her sole source of support. People bond over grief, you're right to feel awkward with this, cause the foundations are there to potentially grow into something else.\n\nYou could explain why she needs to branch out to her own support during the holidays. Maybe dropping off a gift will ease her pain but that's part of the grieving process and your husband can't do much there", "NTA, What did they do for the holidays before the husband passed? She has no one else?

It sounds like the weekends are really what bothered you and instead of speaking up then, you waited until this horribly chosen moment.

After the holidays, if you feel your husband is spending too much time away and neglecting you.. share your feelings.", "YTA and if your family is \"awkward\" with it then they are TAs too. \nHer husband died. Her best friend. Her life partner. Her spouse. And she has NO ONE. Idk if you've ever lost anybody, but the first holiday season feels like hell even when it's a cousin or something. A spouse?

It's your husband's Christmas too and part of Christmas is about giving.", "I lean to NAH and N T A, and I will say NAH fits best-\n\nI get the Y T A responses but I also feel people are jumping the gun when calling you mean spirited and the grinch. Christmas is a difficult time for many people who loose their loved ones months prior and I can understand from a perspective that your husband points out hes just helping a friend- which obviously is a lovely thing to do!\n\n However, you mentioned he's spent a lot of time with her because of their shared grieving and you seem to come off as jealous when you said his request made you uncomfortable. That to me it seems like he hasnt been reassuring you either on the nature of the relationship he has with her. So I understand not wanting to invite her into your celebration because its gotten to a point where you are speculative. Especially when you are inviting family that she probably doesn't even know outside of your husband. \n\nI say NAH because nobody should spend Christmas alone, however it seems to me that you havent communicated with your husband on how you've felt about this relationship with his friends widow and you clearly need to have an open and healthy discussion about that in particular. I feel if this was written from the other perspective as a man, the judgements would be more neutral because of how quick people are to just say you're jealous and move on. Truth be told I think your issue is your not communicating how you feel and you need to have him be open with you and vice versa.", "YTA\n\nShe's was his best friends wife who was like family to him therefore is family to you.

My late husband best friend and his wife were there for me when I needed them the most. Maybe I missed it but it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s calling him to come over every weekend. Perhaps you could extend an olive branch and get to know her.

The way women are set up to see each other as rivals is fucked. \n\nOP: This sounds like a you problem that could very quickly escalate if you don\u2019t get over your insecurities and show some compassion. I\u2019m not suggesting your husband would do anything - but if I had a partner trying to control me and stop me from supporting a bereaved friend out of jealousy and insecurity it would damage my relationship. \n\nTalk to your husband calmly and rationally about your insecurities, tell him that you know that he\u2019s grieving too, that you trust him and acknowledge it\u2019s something that *you* need to get over, but perhaps he could better balance his time between supporting her and being there for you, perhaps by setting boundaries around his time on weekends - eg. he can spend a few hours helping her or doing odd jobs on a Saturday but Sunday is couple time. Tell him you don\u2019t know widow very well but you\u2019d like to be there for her too, and that she\u2019s welcome to come for Christmas dinner. And then go out of your way to include her for the most difficult time of the year for anyone dealing with loss.", "If you think a healthy marriage involves not being friends with or helping members of the opposite sex, I don\u2019t know what to tell ya", ">In fact, he should be visiting his best friend's \"window with his wife, not alone by himself\n\nThis is literally one of the most insane things I've ever seen on Reddit.

I would not be Ok with that. Next thing we know Op will be posting how she found them in bed together and some excuse how it just happened.", "Agree...EVERY WEEKEND?? why would he need to go over every weekend? and for how long is he there? Did the BF live in a shack and the husband is building her a house, like WTF?? It just seems more shady than helpful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA for OP, who wants to spend a peaceful holiday with family & friends. It would be awkward since she isn't friends with the widow. Widow will also prolly cling to husband if she's at a dinner and knows no one else.  Husband is weird for being so adamant and needs to be called out if there's other motives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn a personal note, I just lost my father this past Aug. and I don't want to celebrate xmas at all this year. Widow might want to be alone and not have to 'fake' happy/cheery in front of others (especially strangers).", "Did he take her back?!", "Thank you!

OP said he\u2019s going over every weekend, but I don\u2019t see where it says how long he stays.", ">spending the entire weekend is weird.\n\nIt would be, but all OP said is that he 'shows up each weekend.' Sounds much more like 'visiting for an hour or two' than 'spending all weekend, every weekend.'", "OP didn't say anything about the entire weekend", "Right? Does the widow not have a support system outside of OPs hubby?", "I must have missed where OP said he's been spending the whole weekend with the widow.", "People seem to forget that he's grieving too. He's spending every weekend at the house of his best friend who just died. Probably swapping stories about him with his widow. He might need this as much as she doe.s I honestly think the wife should step up in comforting and communicating with her grieving husband.", "She said every weekend, not the entire weekend. Did she?", "If you considered your best friend a brother, she would be a SIL. It's not abnormal to rally around a SIL. He wants to do right by his late best friend and help make sure the widow is OK. Nothing wrong with that unless romantic feels ever used to be on the table.", ">He\u2019s spending every weekend with her for the past month?\n\nResponding to this. Either way, the dude lost his best friend. Like... come on.", "I agree but I think they should have her for Christmas dinner, and separately she should discuss her discomfort with how much time her husband is spending away", ">Two non related people grieving over the same thing, together & alone is a recipe for disaster\n\nJesus.\n\nIf your partner is going to cheat, they'll cheat.

Every single holiday (Xmas, Easter, thanksgiving) they have always had their door open to his widow. We are extremely close with her, and she knows that she always has a home with my family. She\u2019s like a second mother to me. So I guess because of this experience that I\u2019m just confused by this.", "My boss does this.  He continues date night with his wife but about once or twice a month, they both include a friend or two that are widows.  He recently opened his date night to also include a recently divorced colleague as well.  It\u2019s really sweet, to not let them get lost in their grief\u2026if even for a night, he tries.", "I'm sure I could wrangle an invitation, but there's no point. I can't bear to be around couples anymore. I got only four years with my husband - and only four months as his wife - being around people who are in their third decade of marriage is just too painful. I'll never have that. \n\nI don't begrudge anyone their happiness, but I can't watch it. I don't really have anything to celebrate anymore anyway - just killing time until time returns the favor. But i genuinely appreciate the thought.", "Now, THAT is a VERY real possibility. You'd be horrified and disgusted by how often married men try to hook up with new widows.

It will be 25 years next year and sometimes she still wishes she had died too.  \n\nOP said this man was like a brother to her husband so firstly why doesn't she know the woman better as she would be like a Sister-in-Law to her husband and second it's not like she's not already inviting people over but it does seem like from her comments it's only her family not his so why can't he invite someone. \n\nOP- YTA, if you have issues with him spending every weekend then you should address them but to not share Christmas with what amounts to your husband's SIL because you are having your family over and forbidding him from inviting someone is an A-hole move.", "This sounds like a regular occurrence so family would expect it. In that case, yes, invite her. But many families have a much tighter, \"family only\" Christmas.

Or it might not. You just don't know.", "Welcome to AITA!", "I'm sorry you had to deal with that. I feel like friends who do this are just awful people, and sadly show their true colours.\n\nPeople need to realize that your spouse is around single people literally all the time, and frankly they don't even need to be around single people to have affairs if they want to. Married people also sleep together all the time. If someone wants to have an affair, they'll have one. You can basically find temptation everywhere. IDK why you'd abandon your friend because they suddenly became single.  \n\nBut I must admit, I think it is strange that he spends every weekend with this woman, and why his wife wouldn't come hang out as well. The whole thing just seems weird, but I also think a lot of info is missing.", "thank you for this!!!

Because it's a man and a woman, it can't be non-sexual. They probably had a friendship already and it comforts them to grieve together.\n\nAnd if she doesn't have any other place to go for Christmas, I doubt she has a big support network around her.\n\nAlso, if they were up to something, he would not invite her to a family dinner.", "My best friend died suddenly and I spent weeks at her husband\u2019s house and in town 250 miles away helping with their baby, funeral arrangements, distracting him, etc and we still invite him to our functions years later.

It\u2019s weird she didn\u2019t have a relationship with her husband\u2019s best friend\u2019s wife in the first place, too.

OP still might feel lonely that her husband isn't spending time with her and their family. OP could also be upset that in her husbands time of need and grief he is turning towards another women instead of her for support. To top this off, now the one time of year that is also about family, and she is asking him to put their family first, he is only think about a different women.", "Sometimes grief turns into something more.

Maybe she should be going with the hubby if she's weirded out by how much time he spends with his friends widow. Maybe have her over as much as he's over there. If she's even 1% concerned there's something maybe going on, she needs to get that out of her head and start engaging with the things that make her uncomfortable. \n\nIf she needs people, why not just be her people?
