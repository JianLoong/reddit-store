I refused but he insisted saying it'd mean so much to her especially since this is her first christmas without her husband and we should comfort her. I refused and said that it's supposed to be a family celebration and my family will show up so there's enough amount of guests already but he said she the one who needs this family atmesphere the most. I snapped and firmly told him I will not agree to let him invite her to christmas dinner with us and he needed to drop it cause it made me uncomfortable.\n\nHe argued then started sulking about it saying that I was being cruel for no reason and that he wasn't asking for much. just an extra chair/plate for her.

You may not think anything suspicious is going on, and probably nothing is, but it IS making you uncomfortable. Your post screams that.\n\nTry to be honest with yourself. Get those feelings out on the table to look at. Are you uncomfortable because you see him doing chores for her, but not at home? Are there other red flags, like past behavior? Maybe things feel unbalanced and you can't put a finger on it. It's ok to acknowledge that and talk it out.\n\nNow let's address Christmas. It's highly unlikely that he would bring a potential affair partner to a family dinner. And he's not keeping you from her. It might be a really good opportunity to get closer to her, especially if she needs friends right now. \n\nI'm going with NAH (probably), but maybe work on addressing your feelings, even if you don't like them.

Something seems off.\n\n*Edit*\n\nAfter reading all these comments, I want to add that personally, my family would absolutely roast me if they showed up to Christmas and my husband invited another woman unrelated to him. Every single one of my family members would be super suspect of the entire situation. I'm not saying either of them are intentionally planning on eloping behind your back, but two straight members of the opposite sex leaning on each other during a time of shared grief, and spending time together without you, is a huge set up for failure in my opinion.

If this is more of an issue with you being jealous of the time that he is spending with her, then maybe YTA.\n\nPersonally, I would just have her over... thinking people being alone on Xmas is very sad to me personally, and it doesn't seem like a huge deal if it is just one person.", "INFO: What\u2019s your problem with the widow?", "YTA\n\nYour husband is grieving too and trying to honour his friend. \n\nIf she has a better option, she'll take it...\n\nBut imagine if she doesn't?

Erm, you're busy too, but why does that not matter?  Her actual friend's plans are to be respected, but yours, when you and she are not close and when you're family are coming, are to be ignored?  That's weird to me, and this reeks of overstepping boundaries you've said you're not comfortable with.\n\nIf she has no close friends then that's sad, but also, why not?  No-one is anyone else's responsibility like that, and whilst you should of course be kind and helpful, you don't have to accommodate someone if it will make you uncomfortable.  Has she tried to be your friend in the months since her husband passed?  Have you made an effort?  Had you already decided you don't like her?  I think you should reach out and try to be friends, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't have your family Xmas.

I agree with your husband that an extra plate/chair won't put you out that much and it's CHRISTMAS.

It will only be awkward if you and your family make it so; is it really so difficiult for you all to be welcoming to another human?\n\nJeez. Be nicer?\n\nOr be honest and admit you're jealous of the attention this woman is getting.\n\nETA: Over the years we've invited plenty of distant family members, friends, coworkers to holiday events so they wouldn't be alone.

For those who oppose me think about all the weekends she has not had with her husband. She doesn\u2019t have time with him but like any person still wants to know that she is his priority In life. Having this family Christmas as would reassure her that he is still there for his family and she is still his priority.", "NTA.  You guys, he's spending ALL of his time off at this woman's house.  Most wives are gunna resent their husband being at another woman's house every time he's off work.  Yes, that's how emotional affairs start.  It's nice he wants to help but the widow is not 100% his responsibility.  Helping out should be contingent on all parties consent.  The guy is obviously shirking his husbandly duties to his wife.  If he continues then he wont have a wife anymore.", "Idk\u2026 you\u2019ve been patient and understanding with him spending EVERY weekend with her. I would be getting annoyed and pissed as well. NTA.", "YTA. Your husband sounds like he is truly a compassionate man, and you could really stand fo learn from him. A man that he considered to be his brother is gone. His spouse is also family by extension.

Widow has her own family and can't rely on your husband as her sole source of support. People bond over grief, you're right to feel awkward with this, cause the foundations are there to potentially grow into something else.\n\nYou could explain why she needs to branch out to her own support during the holidays. Maybe dropping off a gift will ease her pain but that's part of the grieving process and your husband can't do much there", "NTA, What did they do for the holidays before the husband passed?

It sounds like the weekends are really what bothered you and instead of speaking up then, you waited until this horribly chosen moment.

That to me it seems like he hasnt been reassuring you either on the nature of the relationship he has with her. So I understand not wanting to invite her into your celebration because its gotten to a point where you are speculative. Especially when you are inviting family that she probably doesn't even know outside of your husband. \n\nI say NAH because nobody should spend Christmas alone, however it seems to me that you havent communicated with your husband on how you've felt about this relationship with his friends widow and you clearly need to have an open and healthy discussion about that in particular. I feel if this was written from the other perspective as a man, the judgements would be more neutral because of how quick people are to just say you're jealous and move on. Truth be told I think your issue is your not communicating how you feel and you need to have him be open with you and vice versa.", "YTA\n\nShe's was his best friends wife who was like family to him therefore is family to you.

My late husband best friend and his wife were there for me when I needed them the most. Maybe I missed it but it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s calling him to come over every weekend.

His brother's wife, who he has more than likely met and hung out with when visiting his brother. \n\n\nSo he goes to her since she gets it, she's in pain too. The difference is she's going through this pain alone while he has you.

Are you still eating meals together, or is he packing a weekend bag and spending Friday night-through-Sunday night with her, and only coming home for work on the weekdays? There\u2019s a big difference between that and only spending couple hours a day with someone. \n\nIt isn\u2019t unusual for people grieving that deeply to need so much extra support when it\u2019s so fresh. But what\u2019s the context of this weekend time together? Is the widow calling desperately for help and refusing to let him leave her alone at the end of the weekend? Or is he just deciding that she needs his company regardless of how she actually feels? Maybe he\u2019s expressing his own grief through being her caretaker in this time? Or maybe it\u2019s more neutral, is there some sort of schedule between friends and family that people have taken \u201cshifts\u201d in order to support her in a way that works to spread the work between them?

(Personally in my family, no one would be turned away and family members often bring friends or roommates who have nowhere else to go that day. Extending invitations to include grieving friends in activities is natural to show care.) so I think the problem is more likely that you are upset with the balance of time he is spending with the widow and you\u2019re probably feeling more like you\u2019re losing your own husband.

There\u2019s other resources she has access to, and she might need them, like a grief counselor or support group or starting a hobby to distract herself occasionally or make friends. \n- how have you personally dealt with the loss, and how have you dealt with your husband\u2019s loss and his own feelings about it?

All you know is he\u2019s visiting her quite a bit. The answer to your problem is communication.

So no matter how long I may know the person, such as my husband's cousin's wife, whom I've known for years, I won't like. So when your spouse hangs out with that person, they don't do it around you.

It's different than a divorce where someone might be looking for revenge or a distraction.  The kind of thinking you are describing is why so many women pull away from widows who are grieving.

It's all too easy for people to let that fall into emotional affairs and then physical affairs even if they were originally good upstanding spouses and people.

It's not really fair to assume that OP thinks husband is bordering on infidelity because she didn't explicitly say it. It's perfectly natural to be somewhat jealous of your spouse prioritizing their time elsewhere when it doesn't involve you, regardless of their gender.\n\nI also think a lot of responses are overlooking the 'traditional' nature of Christmas family get togethers.

I bet for many that is something that doesn't happen. Would it kill anyone to have that extra plate there? Of course not. Would most people there probably prefer the status quo of the Christmas dinner with family only? Of course. Being a part of the family is usually a requirement for a lot of family gatherings.

Also, while it may seem weird, death does funny things to a family - this woman may have family that's still around like siblings, parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, yadda, yadda, yadda; BUT a lot of the time family members will avoid the widow/widower because the mere sight of them triggers overwhelming emotions of the heavily negative variety. It gets even worse if kids are in the picture, as the death of a parent and how the other parent handles it definitely messes with a kid if something goes wrong.\n\nIt's messed up, but it happens.\n\nAgain, please talk this out with your husband.

This could be a great opportunity to have something good come out of something so devastating, and once you get to know her, maybe you won't feel as uncomfortable  with your husband going to help her out.

I understand that sometimes friends or family may back away while they\u2019re also dealing with the loss. But it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s fair to you.

Hard agree with no winning, people telling OP to talk honestly as if OP has an option of not looking like an AH to their husband.

How many months for one, and how much time every weekend he spends over there.  \n  \nI think OP is definitely jealous, and should have a serious talk with her husband, rather than turn to Reddit to validate her feelings. So she's a bit of an AH for not being honest with him and herself. Which is probably why she's coming off as lacking empathy.  \n  \nAnd I think a lot of people are forgetting that OP's husband is a human being too. Just because he's a man they are forgetting that he's grieving for his very close friend too. And I can imagine since OP didn't mention that either, her jealousy is blinding her to this fact, and without that support at home I can definitely see it driving him to spend more time with his best friend's wife. And no I don't mean sexually.  \n  \nI also think Christmas is a time to be charitable and understanding of others, so I don't see the problem with inviting her for Christmas. But only after OP and her husband sit down and communicate their feelings openly with each other.", "Nah people definitely bring the side girl around family all the time. You greatly underestimate how shitty people can be.", "When one of my classmates passed away his wife met a man and was madly in love with him 6 months later.  He didn\u2019t know her well, but had volunteered to help her and her son.  Luckily he was single.", "I\u2019m lucky in that my husband\u2019s old roommate/best friend\u2019s wife became one of my really close friends in the last several years. We live close and have a lot in common, and get along well. My best friend\u2019s husband and mine get along fine but they don\u2019t have much in common and live a couple hours away. Circumstances and personalities have a lot to do with it.", "I can\u2019t imagine your grief. I hope you have been receiving counseling for what you\u2019ve been through, because that was a lot to process. I\u2019ve been divorced a long time, and don\u2019t have children or grandchildren, but I do have a brother  a couple of hours away, and extended family and  friends. However, there are certain events during the holidays , even at church,  where I feel more alone than included, so I understand your need to avoid social gatherings during the holidays. I wish you all the best.", "I don't want to sound negative but your husband sounds like he wants to be a knight in white shining harmour to his friend's widow. I have heard of this happening before and it often ends up with the husband having an affair.\n\nI would nip this in the bud real quick. He sounds overly eager and this is quite inappropriate. Please tell him exactly  how you feel or get marriage counselling. I am saying this because I have heard of some men wanting to rescue women etc and we all know how that ends up. I know that he is grieving but sometimes people who share a common pain bond over it and it can turn romantic. \n\nNTA for sure. You have every reason to take a stand.", "NAH with the info given\n\nIf she truly has nowhere to go, I understand your husband wanting to invite her. It also seems like maybe this relationship could be crossing a boundary for you and you would just like some time with your husband if he\u2019s spending all of his free time with her. \n\nEvery weekend seems excessive, does she have kids that need help? Does she not have other friends who could help out on occasion? Is he spending time with you anymore? Could you join him on some of these visits?  How did the best friend and his wife usually spend the holidays? If they traveled spent it with someone other that you and your husband, is there a reason she can\u2019t do that now?\n\nI think you need to have a discussion with you husband about everything. Be honest and tell him if their relationship and the time they\u2019re spending together seems to be crossing boundaries. Things like this can easily be how affairs start. Be up front about all of it, because just trying to keep her away for one holiday isn\u2019t going to solve the real issue. \n\nPlease update us when the time comes!", "He needs to put some distance between himself and this woman, not completely cut her off; but not spend so much time with her. Grief can do strange things and it's possible she could end up very attached to him if he keeps it up. What he's doing is seemingly innocent from his perspective, but he's not thinking it through. \n\nYou're right to not invite her, but the issue needs explaining more to him, rather than just turning it back round on him that you've already got enough guests coming and that Christmas is for family. She surely has family herself, its not your responsibility to look after her at this time of year.", "As would I. I\u2019d be in absolute bits if I lost my best friend because she means so much to me. A true best friend is like an extension of yourself.", "Or maybe there's too much pineapple chocolate cake leftover", "Sometimes a couple will move far from family because of work, or one is in the military. \n\nBoth my parents were born and raised in the same general area of a midwestern state; but I was born on the east coast because Dad was in the service. \n\nIf someone in that position lost their spouse, and lives far from family ( for any number of reasons) they may not be able to move back near family as quickly. They may still be working, or have a house they\u2019d need to sell, kids in high school, etc. \u2014any reason NOT to move. \n\nAnd anyone who has spent time on this sub knows that some people cut their parents and/or siblings out of their lives for good reason.  They may not get along with their in-laws. \n\nOr the widow may be an only child whose parents are deceased. \n\nMy spouse\u2019s parents are both deceased and his one sibling lives across the country from us. Not much family there for him to rely on, if I go first. \n\nTLDR:  family as a support is not a luxury all widows/widowers have.", "No, she might have been dependent on her husband that died. \n\nAnd if its OPs husbands best friend, then I'm sure she is husbands friend too.  You talk about her like she's an acquaintance you see twice a year", "I had a friend who married her dead boyfriend\u2019s best friend. So yeah it happens.", "Also a widow. My husband died two days before Christmas 2020. I completely fell apart. His best friend was there for my kids and me, and I am so grateful for everything he did for us. There is something about being able to share my grief with someone else who loved my husband that is very comforting. Many people open their homes to complete strangers at the holidays so they don\u2019t have to be alone. YTA for not opening your home for someone you know.", "As a widower I can say it is the exact same with us. Friends like OPs husband that will look after your spouse after you pass are what make this world worth living.", "She is communicating her boundaries with Christmas and while she didn't feel perfectly fine with her husband visiting his friend's widow she knew that it is the right thing.\nFor me, it is NAH. I do understand  why she doesn't want her over during Christmas (especially when family  is coming over) but I also understand why husband  wants  to invite her. It is a really shitty position to be in and I am not even talking about the widow and the first Christmas without her husband. I don't wish that to anyone.", "The vagueness is a huge red flag. She's trying to make people think that he's probably cheating on her, because at her big age this is where her mind goes when a guy isn't completely sociopathic toward another woman.", "Age has nothing to do with having a suspicious mind. And you're right, OP does come across as possibly leaving out info to make her seem the victim here."]}
