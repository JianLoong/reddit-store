He decided we were going to play checkers in the evenings for entertainment, so we started doing that.  He absolutely destroyed me for several days running and loved it.  In the college library I found a book about checker strategy and devoted the day to reading it.  That night I beat him in 3 straight games and he never wanted to play again.
