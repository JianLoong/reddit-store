Make him think people let him win out of pity.\n\nNTA Your brother sounds selfish and tiresome.", "Ha ha! That is so awesome.  Sounds like everyone watching the match knows how your brother is (must be the best at everything!) and enjoyed seeing him get taken down a peg.   \nI\u2019m sure he felt embarrassed, but that just comes with the territory.\n\nReminds me of playing checkers with my boyfriend in college.  He decided we were going to play checkers in the evenings for entertainment, so we started doing that.  He absolutely destroyed me for several days running and loved it.  In the college library I found a book about checker strategy and devoted the day to reading it.  That night I beat him in 3 straight games and he never wanted to play again.  Gee, turns out there are a few \u201cpower\u201d spots in a checker board, that if you get there first, you have a huge advantage.  \n\nKUDOS to your girlfriend and you are NTA.", "NTA.

And he doesn't see anything wrong with this.\n\nNTA. Next time he wants to challenge you to something stupid, tell him you'll let your girlfriend stand in because she's a decent tennis player but really amazing at (activity).", "You didn't allow him to make a fool of himself, he did that all on his own.  \n\nNTA", "why would you have told him and deprived your family of this gift?\n\nNTA", "NTA.

He wanted to play tennis with her. She obliged. You had nothing to do with it. You are under NO obligation to \"warn him\" that he's about to FAFO. Some lessons are best learned in person.", "Nta I'd have laughed and told him he made a fool out of himself and by now if he doesn't understand no means no he's gonna be in a lot more trouble. She told him no and he pushed so he deserved it. I'd bring it up again and again when he tries to act macho reminding him a girl beat him at sports so stop acting a fool", "NTA, that must have been a joy to watch, did you get any videos?", "NTA - That was well played . He was the ahole who made a fool of himself", "Seriously NTA, your brother was simply attention seeking to gain the favor of extended family in attendance.  He was showing off when he got shown up.  He embarrassed himself with his own behavior, nobody else did that", "NTA that's hilarious. \n\n>After a few games, my brother came after her and started jokingly teasing her about being scared to play.

I hope you talked to your parents about this.", "The fact everyone was cheering instead of being neutral suggests that he annoys many people by doing this whole \u201cI\u2019m sure he best\u201d thing.
