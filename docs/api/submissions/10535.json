He needed some deflation for his extreme ego from the sounds of it.", "Your brother is an asshole. If he wasn\u2019t, he would\u2019ve joked about it and not throw a little toddler tantrum.\n\nI hope he enjoyed that humble pie but I suspect he will carry on being an asshole and an arrogant one at that.", "NTA", "NTA.  He made a fool out of himself.", ">He said I told her she wasn't interested and that he thought I meant she didn't know to play\n\nSounds like a \"him\" problem\n\n>I still don't know what his issue is\n\nThe \"issue\" is that he got a call from his doctor and, simply put, his butt cannot be saved. It's just to hurt", "If you challenge and taunt somebody, you should accept that you might lose. You don't have to win every game. NTA.", "NTA - sometimes when you bully people it doesn\u2019t work out for ya. Not all heroes wear capes, but you should find your gf one.", "NTA. He fished for that pain \ud83d\ude02", " if you told him she was really good he would've taken it as a challenge and would be mad either way. Nta", "NTA, he is the dingus that decided to act like a hot shot. He got his butt deservingly put into its place.", "NTA\n\nRemind him what it means to assume. If he had asked, you would have told him. He didn\u2019t ask, so there was no reason to mention it. Therefore, you aren\u2019t an a-h.\n\nHowever, beating people who aren\u2019t as skilled doesn\u2019t make him a champion. He got what he deserved.", "NTA. My sister did this (to a lesser degree) to my fianc\u00e9, thinking she\u2019d whoop him because he doesn\u2019t like to brag, and she thinks she\u2019s the best at everything. He played varsity tennis in high school, played in college, and has essentially placed out of the intermediate level of our local USTA league. He wiped the floor with her and told me after that she sucked \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. I agree this is funny. He made a fool out of himself. Your girlfriend was gracious about the whole thing. Your brother definitely the AH.", "NTA! And your gf \u2014 and you and the rest of the planet \u2014 shouldn\u2019t have to diminish or dismiss their skills or accomplishments or talents just to cater to the delicate sensibilities of your gossamer-bone, tissue baby, melted cupcake frosting, cheap scotch-taped together feelings\u2019ed brother! It\u2019s not like your GF made a spectacle out of winning and gave your BF a swirly after; which, after swatting the drink out of his hand, I would have totally done. Don\u2019t make yourselves small for him so he can feel big, and if your parents are up your ass about it, tell them it\u2019s their fault and you have nothing to do with his bullshit lol\n\nEdit: grammar", "NTA but hilarious. He can't get good if he plays with chumps. If anything, she was doing him a favor. Get good scrub!", "NTA. This is a great example of \"Play stupid games win stupid prizes.\"", "Nta.  He didn't ask anyone about their skill level. He pressed your gf to play tennis. Not your job to educate him..Always amazes me when someone like your brother acts like a jerk then blames others for not protecting them from their own behavior. He wanted to make your gf look like a loser. Totally his fault.", "\"Oh, I see. So your self-worth is based on beating people at a sport you think they don't know how to play.\"\n\nI guarantee that even if they'd told the brother that she was good at tennis, he wouldn't have believed it, or would have assumed he'd win anyway.", "Exactly. I felt this vibe as well, especially since her brother escalated once she was with her partner. \n\nHomophobic people always have to outdo the LGBTQ people around them because they see LGBTQ people as \u201cless than.\u201d He probably feels insecure that OP is with a woman who is more accomplished than he is. He wants to beat OP\u2019s partner in things to show that he, a certified straight man, is better. He is fragile to the core. I\u2019m sure this shook him completely. Not only that he lost to a woman, which I\u2019m sure he also looks down on in general, but it\u2019s a double whammy to lose to an LGBTQ woman because of his specific distaste for them.", "I loved that story as a kid!!", "Classy with a hit of a burn. I like it. Also, GF was trying to do him a favor. You can't get better if you don't play with the best.", "Your gf is classy! Love it!", "Thank you so much \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA.\n\nAnd what are you feeling guilty about? He literally bullied your GF into a match and he got destroyed in the process. What is he mad about? Losing to a girl? He should know that he shouldn't dish it if he can't take it. Your brother sounds to me like an entitled AH and a very sour loser.", "Maybe next time he will think before doing something", "NTA\n\nHe made a fool out of himself.", "> He said I told her she wasn't interested and that he thought I meant she didn't know to play\n\nIf only every time someone who was uninterested could destroy their opponent. NTA You force someone into playing against you, you don't get to complain that they're better than you.", "A fine example of instant karma. NTA", "Don't feel guilty NTA your brother is a HUGE A H and had this coming.", "nTA", ">He later told me I was an absolute AH for allowing him to make a fool out of himself.\n\nHe's an adult. He's allowed to make a fool of himself without asking anyone's permission.", "NTA I love this story and he deserved it! This is hilarious!", "Your brothers 28 and still acts like this? Lol NTA", "NTA. You told him she wasn\u2019t interested and he still persisted, he deserved to be taught a lesson lol. Not to be too analytical but it\u2019s kinda concerning that a grown man doesn\u2019t understand \u201cshe\u2019s not interested\u201d\u2026. yikes", "NTA - this is the definition of\" fuck around and find out.\"\nAnd find out he did.", "NTA. your brother should get a sense of humor and be able to laugh at himself.  I would be rolling on the ground if that happened to me", "NTA. He\u2019s upset that he finally reaped what he sowed with all of his trash talk.", "NTA   You're brother sounds like he has to be number one in everything and this showed him that he wasn't. His pride and ego was hurt. He'll be okay.", "Nope and NTA\u2026.he acted like a jerk and no apology is warranted", "Pfft. NTA. Your brother wanted to show up your girlfriend, especially after he assumed she didn\u2019t know how to play. Naturally he threw a tantrum when she demolished him on the court. \n\nHe did this to himself. Whatever issue he has with your and/or your girlfriend, he needs to sort it out himself. The only thing *you* need to do is set clear boundaries with him so he doesn\u2019t keep trying to humiliate you to satisfy his ego.", "Your brother is 28 and embarrassed about losing to a girl. Like\u2026\u2026 \ud83d\ude02\u2620\ufe0f", "Maybe he will learn that no is a complete answer..he persisted and it led to him being embarrassed all of which he caused", "NTA", "NTA???? why would you be for not telling him every thing about your girlfriend and she has shown she does not really want to talk about herself that's fine and you are respecting that he's just a sore loser", "Nta right because if he had needless tormented your gf all day and then smoked her at a game she didn't know how to play he would have looked so cool. /s", "\nNah bro your bro is more of the AH", "My bad, I meant the match. It didn't last very long", "\"People who play games...\n\n...think other people play games.\"", "Your gf sounds amazing! Need to find other ways to give golden bro a taste of his own medicine.", "Yes!  He only challenged her because he thought she couldn't play!\n\nThis is the epitome of an asshole."]}
