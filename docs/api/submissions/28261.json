When he died, his widow, \u201cCarla\u201d fell into a deep depression and became an alcoholic. It took over her life, she lost her job, her house, and she wasn\u2019t able to look after their son, \u201cCharlie\u201d, who was 2. Carla didn\u2019t have any family around to help and was looking at a lot of financial problems as a result of her alcoholism. She reached out to my parents and asked if they could take Charlie because she couldn\u2019t manage. My dad was suffering from a lot of health problems and my mother was caring for him so they suggested me, even though I was pregnant at the time. My husband and I said yes immediately. \n\nAfter Charlie came to live with us, Carla made very little effort with him. I gave her a pass on being in contact because she was going through a lot, but even when we would fly her out to visit us she would be very uninterested in Charlie. She would spend little time with him, and had a very short fuse with him. Charlie was a shy kid, he wasn\u2019t affectionate or comfortable with her and she hated that. She would start off wanting to bond with him but the minute he wouldn\u2019t cuddle her or would cry when she picked him up and she would hand him back to me and ignore him for the rest of her trip and treat our home like a resort. After a visit where she yelled at him for not calling her \u201cmum\u201d, none of us brought up visits again. My husband I adopted Charlie when he was 5. \n\nFor 4 years after the adoption we heard almost nothing from Carla, except calls every few months and birthday cards for Charlie. Then, late last year we received papers from her saying she intended to Sue to overturn the adoption. She didn\u2019t want any contact with us, only through lawyers, but it was a stressful time. It went on for a few months until eventually proceedings concluded before ever getting to court. Our lawyer said reading between the lines it seemed like Carla couldn\u2019t afford to keep fighting it and she would never have won. Again, we didn\u2019t hear anything from her. \n\nAbout a week ago, Carla gets in contact directly. We get on a zoom call and I was shocked by the difference in her. She looks a lot healthier, she has a job, and a house (knew this from documents she submitted for the legal case), and a fianc\u00e9. She said she wants Charlie to come to the wedding. She wants visitation with him. I said not until Charlie is 12, at which point he will be welcome to establish a relationship with her on his terms if he so wishes, with our full support. \n\nObviously she thinks I\u2019m the AH. She says 12 is an arbitrary age and it gives him another two years to think she doesn\u2019t care about him. I think that in a couple of years he will more emotionally equipped to process his own feelings and understand the measures we will need to put in place given that Carla has proven to be litigious, if he wants to see her.

You guys owe her nothing. Charlie owes her nothing. If your son wants to see her, support him. If not, support him but let him be part of the choice. And please make sure she is not contacting him directly. The last thing y\u2019all want is for her to try to guilt him even if it is unintentional", "NTA. But you should tell Charlie, that his bio mother contacted you. Try to see, how he feels. Because if you keep this a secret from him and she tells him, when he is 12 that 'you bad people' keept him away from her, it could ffect your relationship with him. Teenage years are difficul and children tend to rebel against their parents. So best don't give Carla this monition. Also I think it could help Charlie to know, that his bio mother got her stuff together and wants to meet him. But this depends on his mental state and how he sees all of this.", "this is allround tough to judge. the only thing here that really matters is charlie. and him alone.", "NTA. In a situation like this, when a party is insistent on forcing contact, it means that the situation is about their wants/needs and they aren\u2019t thinking about what the child want or needs. If she were, she would be willing to be patient or be willing to work with you for some kind of accommodation and be sensitive to how this will affect his life. But she never asked how he was doing or what he wanted - only what she wanted. \n\nYou are Charlie\u2019s guardian - you did good thinking of him first and his needs. It\u2019s a delicate situation.", "This isn\u2019t a Reddit issue. Whatever choice you make needs to be done with the aid of a therapist or other professional.\n\nPersonally, knowing the type of kid I was, if my parents did what you are planning to do - tell him in that his biological mother got sober and fought for him two years after it happened - it would fill me with such distrust and anger. It would have been something that permanently changed how I trusted and felt about you and your husband. \n\nHowever, I have no idea if that\u2019s applicable here. You know your child best. I just think that if you decide to make this choice for him, a choice you can\u2019t take back, you need to be sure it\u2019s actually in his best interest and, once you are sure of that, that you are mentally prepared for the consequences if he doesn\u2019t agree.", "So after all this time she thinks she can just jump back in his life? Nope, after 10 years of neglect asking for 2 more to let him decide what his future will look like is perfectly reasonable.", "tis above Reddits Paygrade - get a professional Advice here asap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the Verdict - NTA - for protecting your Son!", "NTA. The main concern is what is best for Charlie. A single zoom call is certainly not enough to prove that she has left her old ways behind her and cleaned her life up. She has not yet shown to you guys that she is truly in a healthy, stable place and ready/able to be *consistent* in Charlie's life. If it were me, I would want to have routine contact with her for a duration of time to show she is able to keep in touch, has Charlie's best interests in mind, really learn where she is at in her life, more about her fiance, etc. This would be just between the adults with no involvement of Charlie at this point.", "NTA - he is your kid - you get to decide. She already tried to take him from you - don\u2019t give her any ammunition. Block her", "INFO: what does charlie want?", "Where I'm from kids get a say in visitation/ living arrangements after their parents' break up once they turn 14 because that's the assumed minimum age to be able to make such a decision with all the consequences it may or may not have. Until then, the person entitled to their custody decides for them.\n\nYou're making his decision for him in his best interest now and you plan to involve him in the future - NTA.", "NTA, you are trying to protect your son. However, especially with the future in mind, you might want to be a bit more open about contact and visitation. Yes, when he is 12 he might be more emotionally able to grasp the situation but you also open yourself up for criticism like \u201ewhy didn\u2019t you tell me sooner\u201c or \u201ewhy didn\u2019t you include me in the decision\u201c etc. \nI think Carla is in the wrong how she handled it, she could have done this a lot more gentle and civil, instead of going straight to the lawyer without contacting you first. She may think that, now that she got her life back together, you are keeping her from her son despite having changed for the better. Instead of fostering the resentment further, you could try e.g via mediation, to establish contact with her, set firm boundaries about what she can and cannot do (legally) and see where it goes. If she has the best interest of your son in mind, maybe that will be beneficial. Obviously, both you and your or son should seek therapy to sort out your feeling and find the best way to handle it. wish you all the best", "He\u2019s your son now, he\u2019s 9 years old. She doesn\u2019t get to tap back in at this point. She chose not to be his mom when she refused to get her shit together. I certainly have empathy and understanding for her struggling with addiction, and depression. I don\u2019t mean to dismiss that at all and if she was not able to be a good mother to your son, she did the right thing by letting him go to you. But that was a decade ago, if we were talking about a year later I\u2019d have more understanding for her position. You are the only parents that child has ever known, she has not been a stable presence in his life in any capacity. She doesn\u2019t even know him. I\u2019m glad she is doing better, but going to her now is not in the best interest of your child and that\u2019s what is important, not her and what she wants and what will make her feel better about herself. NTA. Lawyer up.", "NTA. I'm sorry things were bad for her but Carla has got to realized that Charlie's needs come first. Not hers.", "NTA\n\nYou were awarded full custody by default.  She knows she can't take him from you.  She had every opportunity in the past to make a relationship and chose to lash out at him.\n\nEvery time a deadbeat parent comes into and out of a child's life, their disappointments erode the confidence and self worth of the child.  Keep her at arms length, and never just fly him to her.  Who knows what BS she might try and pull?", "NTA. Charlie is - in all the ways that matter AND legally - your child. It\u2019s understandable that she regrets her previous actions and behavior, but that\u2019s not Charlie\u2019s issue to fix. Two years gives her time to actually build a relationship with the son she gave up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

For example: only supervised zoom calls for the next year and make it clear to his birth mother what the boundaries are and not to tempt with something else. You risk creating resentment.

I think 12 is reasonable based on her past interactions with him and with you.  It's insane to try and reverse the adoption when she didn't even act loving when she had contact - clearly she wasn't thinking about him.  But prior to 12, I would have some casual convos with him on the topic.  I have bio and non-bio kids.  We have been honest since day one and let our kids feel how they did (but very different circumstances - bio dad/sperm donor is an awesome boundaried guy - zero acting out towards the kids/suing).  You want to start the discussion now and let HIM ask if he wants to see her.  Then, as you already know, go with him on any visit.", "OP, you need to discuss this with him now. Kids of 10 should be informed. He may turn on you later if he finds out you kept this from him. You'll never forgive yourself if he turns from you to her.", "Im confused on the whole 12 thing tbh. Like 12 your still a kid and probably making just as poor of decisions as you are at 10. I do understand the need to be cautious with his bio mom though as she has proven she will try to use law and what not so making sure all that is in shape makes sense.", "I understood that she was trying to sue you- you did say she couldn\u2019t afford it but if you shut her down she will come back angry and maybe the new husband has money. I\u2019d make a plan for that with a lawyer if I was you. I wish you luck!", "I think you're  being reasonable and looking out for the  kids wellbeing here.", "12 is an age where legally courts tend to start listening to kids in custody battles. It\u2019s young, yes, and obviously we\u2019d be there to offer guidance, but we just feel like 12/13 is an age where a kid should have more knowledge of what\u2019s going on in their world.  Obviously don\u2019t for sure know it\u2019s the right age but I\u2019m not sure what the right age would be. 16 for example seems very late to find out your bio mother wanted contact with you, but now, knowing Charlie, it seems young.", "Fair point. We do still have our lawyers from last time so hopefully all good on that front.\nThanks!", "INFO: how old is charlie now?\n\nI think it is good to be cautious. But I also get the vibe that this will stomp out any potential relationship they might have. Also, what happens when carla tells charlie directly?", "Charlie is 10. \n\nIf we end up telling Charlie when he is older, we would tell him upfront that Carla wanted contact with him earlier, and why we said no. \n\nCurrently she can\u2019t contact him on her own.", "Hm. How mature is he? When i think of a ten year old, i have different kind of kids in my head. Some who are still very young, some who are actually kinda mature (maybe more mature than in the early stages of puberty when hormones hit). \n\nIf you think he can think about the situation clearly, he might should get a say. I would also argue when he becomes a teenager, you not telling him might turn into a boomerang. Especially when his mother apparently really changed and got clean (?). However, I would consult a lawyer what visitation implies. And mayve like someone who gas an idea what it leans for your son and his development? \n\n\nConsidering the history of carla (if you change your mind and allow visitation) I would however be clear that visitations need to be supervised. \n\nI wpuld go with NAH, because to me the situation is comlicated and i am not able to get a clear judgement. You wanting to protect your child is also very commendable, even if i am not sure if it is the right call :) (however, it might be the right call. I am not implying you are wrong, you could be very right)\n\nBtw, if carla would have been 100% out after the adoption, i would say ckearly N T A. But she still is kinda involved, so it is not like she does not exist in some capacity to your son. And now the process starts soon where he will find and shape his personality more and more.\n\nEdit: also, if she clearly would stikl be a deadbeat and everything, also clearly N T A. And regardless of what is it going to be, you are hus parent, not her. That is somdthing i would argue you should be 100% ckear about."]}
