I\u2019ve never wanted them, never been good with them, never cared for them.\n\nMy brother and his wife had their first baby, which is my parents first grand baby. My niece is 3 months old.\n\nOnce a week while my SIL is at work, my mom babysits the baby for the entire day, up to 12 hours including her commute to my brother and SIL house. I used to go every week to help. I\u2019d stay for 8 hours and try to work while I\u2019m there (I wfh). Well during the first month or two of me doing this, I found it incredibly hard to focus on work. Even with my mom there helping, I can\u2019t seem to focus. We both feel like we need to keep an eye on the baby every second of the day. (My mom has admitted she feels this too. We would feel terrible if anything happened when we weren\u2019t looking).\n\nSo I recently backed off. I\u2019ve been telling them I can\u2019t show up for babysitting. My parents asked me why and I said work is very busy. I said \u201cwork is busy and there\u2019s a reason why I chose to never have kids.

It's unreasonable to expect a working person to watch an infant. They need to send her to daycare or get a nanny.\n\nBabies aren't for everyone. It is what it is. As long as you don't act like you're filled with disgust when you see her which I'm not getting that impression from you at all- you're fine.\n\nYour brother chose to have a child.  You didnt. It'd be kind of you to offer to babysit once in a while, so they can go on a date. What they're asking though? Hell  no.", "Nta. It DOES take a village. A lot of things do. But you don't draft a village,,   the village volunteers", "Look saying this AS a mom, NTA. At all. In fact I think that\u2019s quite an imposition your brother and SIL are pushing on you and your mom. You are completely allowed to never want to babysit. No one should be guilting or pressuring you into anything! And I\u2019ve personally always leaned towards your opinion on the village. Is it nice to have support? Of course! But I\u2019d never expect it or demand it.", "NTA. That\u2019s a lot of time to give up for free", "NTA, it's not your child, they chose to have her and they need to make sure they can care for her, its not your responsibility. It's nice for you to help out but it's not required. You need to focus on you and your future.", "NTA - not much explaining needed. You seem to have a clear and level headed approach/take on the situation. I am the same way. Some people don\u2019t understand why everyone isn\u2019t baby/family obsessed.", "If you were male they'd be expecting a lot less from you. NTA.", "Nta to me. You have work to do and shouldn't be expected to babysit anyway. It might be nice to do so, but it is their choice to get a kid. Not yours. And they should respect you not wanting to babysit or visit frequently. \n\nAlso, I think it is normal that you aren't as excited as your parents, becoming grandparents is different than becoming an aunt (with no child wish themselves)", "The village has to volunteer to suit up though. You didn't. NTA. I knew before I had babies that I'd have to manage their care and even sometimes outsource that care. It cost me money to do that. But, it makes much more sense to me than drafting my mom back into the lineup. (Besides she wasn't retired then and now that she is retired, she deserves a break. She raised a football team of her own.) \n\nSo, as much as love babies, I'm not looking for one to take care of. I love all the kids in my family. And I've helped to raise all my siblings' children. But, that was my choice - not my job. And I'm glad its behind us all.\n\nNTA. (If the baby is being managed by grandma and grandpa, what do they need you for?)", "NTA babies are a lot and your not obligated to give free babysitting.If you want to nurture your relationships with your family there other ways to do it .", "NTA - I'll never understand this mentality.  Your brother and SIL are the one's who decided to have a baby.  Did they discuss this decision with you? No? Then why is helping raise their baby your responsibility?  Your Mom babysits because your SIL works - hey guess what? So do you.  Your job is every bit as important as SIL's and they are paying you to meet your deliverables which requires your focus.  There is no reason this baby needs 2 babysitters.  Your Mom, SIL and brother need to show some respect for your actual responsibilities (job) and you.", "NTA, what part of working from home do they not understand?  Tell SIL or brother if they do not want to put their child in daycare to get a WFH job.", "NTA\n\nThey were the ones who decided to have a kid, they meed to fork the money for daycare or a nanny. Its not fair to make you and your mom to do it.", "NTA\n\nYou don't need to be there all the time just bc she's your niece\n\nShe isn't interacting yet\n\nWait until she reaches an age you enjoy\n\nI personally like kids most until about 5-7 years but they peak btw 2-4, other people really enjoy the pre teen or teens. (I like all ages but I mean my preference.)", "NTA. You are not under any obligation to babysit.  I'm betting your brother or mother never asked you if you wanted to babysit, they just assumed. \n\nBesides, assuming you have a job based on hours worked, you cannot do any babysitting while you are claiming to be working. This is theft plain and simple. These kinds of shenanigans are why more employers want employees back in the office.\n\nJust tell them you aren't willing to lose your job for their convenience.", "NTA- If I was your boss and found out you were doing less work on the time I was paying you for to provide free childcare for someone who is doing a full day's work and has another babysitter there, I would sack you. You're contracted to spend those hours doing your assigned tasks. Now, your family are actually salty because spending time with their baby didn't instantly change your mind about having kids yourself- in fact it only confirmed your decision. If there's one thing people hate more than you not wanting what they want, it's meeting their precious angel not being a religious experience.", "NTA.   I may be biased because I have absolutely no interest in babies or small children either, but there\u2019s a very big difference between occasional babysitting for a few hours so they can have a date as you offered, and providing regular all day childcare while you are working. \n\nUltimately, you are working on the days your mom expects you to help with the childcare she agreed to provide.    It might be from home but it\u2019s still working.    Everyone says childcare is not easy (especially not for a baby).    It is not possible to look after a baby AND do your day\u2019s work at your job at the same time.   Both are full time, and you shouldn\u2019t be sacrificing your job (or having to work ridiculously late to make up for the lost work) to help her do what she\u2019s agreed to.", "Why does your SIL get to be baby-free when she works, but you are expected to work from home while also watching a baby? That doesn't make any sense. \"It takes a village\" is just another manipulation technique to get women to provide free babysitting. Don't fall for it. Your brother and SIL need to pay for a babysitter.", "NAH\n\nYour brother is struggling to understand that HIS kids are not YOUR world. Lots of parents do the same. No real assholes here.\n\nTry not to lose touch if possible. Life is funny and you never know when you will need family.", "When you have a kid you\u2019re so in love with them and wrapped up that you don\u2019t understand how others don\u2019t feel the same way for your kids (I am a mom x2, my 3rd to be born within 9 days). That\u2019s probably why he\u2019s distant. It does hurt his feelings and he doesn\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t come around or want to be there. But still NTA.", "NTA. They shouldn\u2019t expect you to watch her. You might want to think about your future relationships with your family though. My SIL barely acknowledged my children. They are now young adults and have no relationship with her. Her lack of interest in them lead to us having a lack of interest in her. She purposely had no kids. She has a very unstable marriage. Her parents are now dead. The only person in the world she has is her husband. When something happens to him she will be all alone.", "It is true what your mother is saying - it takes a village. And you are wrong - the choice was made, and the baby is here. That is more important than a principle...\n\nBut you need to work and make money in order to survive.\n\nNTA\n\nIf I were you I'd do what you need to do, and then try to be helpful in another way - by explaining it all rationally. If they don't listen and treat you badly because of your choice to your own circumstances in life - then I would distance myself from them completely...", "NAH\n\nI feel like you and your mother could have found a better solution to your mother's 12 h babysitting stints. Why could you not agree with her on the spot, while you are also there, that you spend certain blocks of those 12 h - your mother's commuting hours on work so your mother is 100% responsible for the baby, and then you take over for certain blocks of time so your mother can get a break, eat in peace, take a little nap, or just have a cup of tea in peace. I feel like there's no point in both spending around 10 h there on the day whilst you both are 100% 'on'.\n\nBut I understand if you can't do your job, you can't help out on those days. But if you genuinely wanted to help, you'd find a way, like my suggestion above, or maybe on that day you can finish work earlier (because you worked a little extra the days before) and help your mother out the last 2-5 hours of her babysitting day.\n\nI get that maybe a weekly commitment is too much. But your mother isn't wrong about the village thing, if you take it to mean that kids need more than just two adults taking care of them, and that in this day and age many couples both work so help is very welcome. But you are not obligated to help out. Could you suggest helping out one day or half a day every other week?", "So, NTA for not wanting to babysit. But yes, your brother is going to be distant from you. You are literally saying you are not interested in seeing his family except birthdays and holidays even though you\u2019re 10 minutes away. If you don\u2019t want to be a part of his village- either to help or just be around- then why should they treat you like part of it?", "OP\u2026\n\n> I don\u2019t like kids and I never have.\n\n\u2026automatically makes you an asshole.  Then I read the rest of your post and lines like\u2026\n\n> My mom is ALL about \u201cit takes a village\u201d and I\u2019m ALL about \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have a baby if I needed a village\u201d\n\n\u2026cement you as the only asshole.  I\u2019ll give you credit for saying you\u2019d feel terrible if anything happened while you weren\u2019t looking.  But your complete indifference towards kids, especially your niece, is appalling to say the least.\n\nYTA and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your brother and sister-in-law cut you out of your niece\u2019s life.  She deserves better than you.", "NTA but I also tend to dislike anyone who avoids kids and dogs. I suppose you think dogs are dirty and also not worth the trouble.

I think them asking for your help once a week is too much, no matter what choice you make.

Seriously, people use these phrases everywhere, wherever they find it convenient to use.
