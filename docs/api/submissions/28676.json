I\u2019ve never wanted them, never been good with them, never cared for them.\n\nMy brother and his wife had their first baby, which is my parents first grand baby. My niece is 3 months old.\n\nOnce a week while my SIL is at work, my mom babysits the baby for the entire day, up to 12 hours including her commute to my brother and SIL house. I used to go every week to help. I\u2019d stay for 8 hours and try to work while I\u2019m there (I wfh). Well during the first month or two of me doing this, I found it incredibly hard to focus on work. Even with my mom there helping, I can\u2019t seem to focus. We both feel like we need to keep an eye on the baby every second of the day. (My mom has admitted she feels this too. We would feel terrible if anything happened when we weren\u2019t looking).\n\nSo I recently backed off. I\u2019ve been telling them I can\u2019t show up for babysitting. My parents asked me why and I said work is very busy. I said \u201cwork is busy and there\u2019s a reason why I chose to never have kids.

It's unreasonable to expect a working person to watch an infant. They need to send her to daycare or get a nanny.\n\nBabies aren't for everyone. It is what it is. As long as you don't act like you're filled with disgust when you see her which I'm not getting that impression from you at all- you're fine.\n\nYour brother chose to have a child.  You didnt. It'd be kind of you to offer to babysit once in a while, so they can go on a date. What they're asking though? Hell  no.", "Nta. It DOES take a village. A lot of things do. But you don't draft a village,,   the village volunteers", "Look saying this AS a mom, NTA. At all. In fact I think that\u2019s quite an imposition your brother and SIL are pushing on you and your mom. You are completely allowed to never want to babysit. No one should be guilting or pressuring you into anything! And I\u2019ve personally always leaned towards your opinion on the village. Is it nice to have support? Of course! But I\u2019d never expect it or demand it.", "NTA. That\u2019s a lot of time to give up for free", "NTA, it's not your child, they chose to have her and they need to make sure they can care for her, its not your responsibility. It's nice for you to help out but it's not required. You need to focus on you and your future.", "NTA - not much explaining needed. You seem to have a clear and level headed approach/take on the situation. I am the same way. Some people don\u2019t understand why everyone isn\u2019t baby/family obsessed.", "If you were male they'd be expecting a lot less from you. NTA.", "Nta to me. You have work to do and shouldn't be expected to babysit anyway. It might be nice to do so, but it is their choice to get a kid. Not yours. And they should respect you not wanting to babysit or visit frequently. \n\nAlso, I think it is normal that you aren't as excited as your parents, becoming grandparents is different than becoming an aunt (with no child wish themselves)", "The village has to volunteer to suit up though. You didn't. NTA. I knew before I had babies that I'd have to manage their care and even sometimes outsource that care. It cost me money to do that. But, it makes much more sense to me than drafting my mom back into the lineup. (Besides she wasn't retired then and now that she is retired, she deserves a break. She raised a football team of her own.) \n\nSo, as much as love babies, I'm not looking for one to take care of. I love all the kids in my family. And I've helped to raise all my siblings' children. But, that was my choice - not my job. And I'm glad its behind us all.\n\nNTA. (If the baby is being managed by grandma and grandpa, what do they need you for?)", "NTA babies are a lot and your not obligated to give free babysitting.If you want to nurture your relationships with your family there other ways to do it .", "NTA - I'll never understand this mentality.  Your brother and SIL are the one's who decided to have a baby.  Did they discuss this decision with you? No? Then why is helping raise their baby your responsibility?  Your Mom babysits because your SIL works - hey guess what? So do you.  Your job is every bit as important as SIL's and they are paying you to meet your deliverables which requires your focus.  There is no reason this baby needs 2 babysitters.  Your Mom, SIL and brother need to show some respect for your actual responsibilities (job) and you.", "NTA, what part of working from home do they not understand?  Tell SIL or brother if they do not want to put their child in daycare to get a WFH job.", "NTA\n\nThey were the ones who decided to have a kid, they meed to fork the money for daycare or a nanny. Its not fair to make you and your mom to do it.", "NTA\n\nYou don't need to be there all the time just bc she's your niece\n\nShe isn't interacting yet\n\nWait until she reaches an age you enjoy\n\nI personally like kids most until about 5-7 years but they peak btw 2-4, other people really enjoy the pre teen or teens. (I like all ages but I mean my preference.)", "NTA. You are not under any obligation to babysit.  I'm betting your brother or mother never asked you if you wanted to babysit, they just assumed. \n\nBesides, assuming you have a job based on hours worked, you cannot do any babysitting while you are claiming to be working. This is theft plain and simple. These kinds of shenanigans are why more employers want employees back in the office.\n\nJust tell them you aren't willing to lose your job for their convenience.", "NTA- If I was your boss and found out you were doing less work on the time I was paying you for to provide free childcare for someone who is doing a full day's work and has another babysitter there, I would sack you. You're contracted to spend those hours doing your assigned tasks. Now, your family are actually salty because spending time with their baby didn't instantly change your mind about having kids yourself- in fact it only confirmed your decision. If there's one thing people hate more than you not wanting what they want, it's meeting their precious angel not being a religious experience.", "NTA.   I may be biased because I have absolutely no interest in babies or small children either, but there\u2019s a very big difference between occasional babysitting for a few hours so they can have a date as you offered, and providing regular all day childcare while you are working. \n\nUltimately, you are working on the days your mom expects you to help with the childcare she agreed to provide.    It might be from home but it\u2019s still working.    Everyone says childcare is not easy (especially not for a baby).    It is not possible to look after a baby AND do your day\u2019s work at your job at the same time.   Both are full time, and you shouldn\u2019t be sacrificing your job (or having to work ridiculously late to make up for the lost work) to help her do what she\u2019s agreed to.", "Why does your SIL get to be baby-free when she works, but you are expected to work from home while also watching a baby? That doesn't make any sense. \"It takes a village\" is just another manipulation technique to get women to provide free babysitting. Don't fall for it. Your brother and SIL need to pay for a babysitter.", "NAH\n\nYour brother is struggling to understand that HIS kids are not YOUR world. Lots of parents do the same. No real assholes here.\n\nTry not to lose touch if possible. Life is funny and you never know when you will need family.", "When you have a kid you\u2019re so in love with them and wrapped up that you don\u2019t understand how others don\u2019t feel the same way for your kids (I am a mom x2, my 3rd to be born within 9 days). That\u2019s probably why he\u2019s distant. It does hurt his feelings and he doesn\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t come around or want to be there. But still NTA.", "NTA. They shouldn\u2019t expect you to watch her. You might want to think about your future relationships with your family though. My SIL barely acknowledged my children. They are now young adults and have no relationship with her. Her lack of interest in them lead to us having a lack of interest in her. She purposely had no kids. She has a very unstable marriage. Her parents are now dead. The only person in the world she has is her husband. When something happens to him she will be all alone.", "It is true what your mother is saying - it takes a village. And you are wrong - the choice was made, and the baby is here. That is more important than a principle...\n\nBut you need to work and make money in order to survive.\n\nNTA\n\nIf I were you I'd do what you need to do, and then try to be helpful in another way - by explaining it all rationally. If they don't listen and treat you badly because of your choice to your own circumstances in life - then I would distance myself from them completely...", "NAH\n\nI feel like you and your mother could have found a better solution to your mother's 12 h babysitting stints. Why could you not agree with her on the spot, while you are also there, that you spend certain blocks of those 12 h - your mother's commuting hours on work so your mother is 100% responsible for the baby, and then you take over for certain blocks of time so your mother can get a break, eat in peace, take a little nap, or just have a cup of tea in peace. I feel like there's no point in both spending around 10 h there on the day whilst you both are 100% 'on'.\n\nBut I understand if you can't do your job, you can't help out on those days. But if you genuinely wanted to help, you'd find a way, like my suggestion above, or maybe on that day you can finish work earlier (because you worked a little extra the days before) and help your mother out the last 2-5 hours of her babysitting day.\n\nI get that maybe a weekly commitment is too much. But your mother isn't wrong about the village thing, if you take it to mean that kids need more than just two adults taking care of them, and that in this day and age many couples both work so help is very welcome. But you are not obligated to help out. Could you suggest helping out one day or half a day every other week?", "So, NTA for not wanting to babysit. But yes, your brother is going to be distant from you. You are literally saying you are not interested in seeing his family except birthdays and holidays even though you\u2019re 10 minutes away. If you don\u2019t want to be a part of his village- either to help or just be around- then why should they treat you like part of it?", "OP\u2026\n\n> I don\u2019t like kids and I never have.\n\n\u2026automatically makes you an asshole.  Then I read the rest of your post and lines like\u2026\n\n> My mom is ALL about \u201cit takes a village\u201d and I\u2019m ALL about \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have a baby if I needed a village\u201d\n\n\u2026cement you as the only asshole.  I\u2019ll give you credit for saying you\u2019d feel terrible if anything happened while you weren\u2019t looking.  But your complete indifference towards kids, especially your niece, is appalling to say the least.\n\nYTA and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your brother and sister-in-law cut you out of your niece\u2019s life.

I think them asking for your help once a week is too much, no matter what choice you make.

Seriously, people use these phrases everywhere, wherever they find it convenient to use.

But you shouldn't be expected to do more.", "NTA, its not your baby and its not like you didnt at least try to help. not everyone is made for having and taking care of kids, esp when they're so small.", "dafaq? she set a baby into the world and than disappears to work everyday for x hours so other ppl can raise the child **unpaid?** you are not enslaved by them.  get the hell away from those mooches. NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI'm childfree by choise. Even before I got pets I made sure that I had people that could and wanted to watch them if needed, and what/when/how long they would be comfortable with, and had backup daycares if none of them couldnt/didnt want to. I created my own willing village that wanted to help because I was clear I would respected their needs and boundaries, and that I would step up in similare ways for them. \n\nA village is fostered and nurtured by mutial care and respect, what you describe sounds more like a wonky monarchy or dictatorship, where they use the idea of village to make the worked bees fall in line for an imaginry community that wont be there for them. To be a bit on the nose, and all that.", "NTA. I have 2 children and my SIL sees them once every few weeks despite living 20 minutes away. I still consider her a great aunt because they love her and she loves them, she just has her own life and isn't overly comfortable around children. It's okay to not want to babysit or see the child often, as long as you're kind when you do.", "NTA. I get parents helping if one or both parents are not literally working a job and have spare time, sure. But asking a working age sibling to take time off work to look after your kid so you can go to work is legit crazy.\n\nhere let me lose say $200 for the day so you can gain $200 for the day and then you don't pay me to look after your kid. Or you could pay someone to look after your kid and I can do my job.\n\nAlso asking someone to go over for 8 or 12 hours so you can do a full shift is ridiculously entitled overall. Asking for a few hours in the evening so you can have a break, go for a meal or just sleep, I'd be absolutely willing to do that, but the stress of looking after a new born for 8+ hours is not something you should expect of anyone except the new parents.", "Nta im the same, but the kids start getting fun around when they get potty trained and they have little personalities. \n\nThe human loaf stage is kinda boring and anxiety inducing", "NTA. Not your kid, not your problem.", "NTA I would however offer to help the village by buying them a gift card at their local pizza place. \n\nWhen the kid is potty trained, maybe you might offer to watch the little kid  for 2-3 hours, one day a month. (Not at your house! Little kids and toddlers are trouble magnets!) But only if you feel comfortable doing that, on the weekend when you are not working & if you want to!", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility.", "Shall I say it again \"WFH is WORKING FROM HOME is WORKING\". You are being paid to work for your company not babysit a child.\n\nYes, it takes a village but it also take PARENTS being responsible for their children's care not assume they can just hand a child off to family because they are at home.", "I agree. Except that the new Ron stage is easier physically than the toddler stage and if \u2018the village\u2019 is suffering now with a baby that can\u2019t move themselves, then they\u2019re screwed when Grandma has a 12 hour day running around after a whirlwind toddler.", "Plus you need to contribute to the village, not just use it when you need it.", "Well, if you do the math, SIL went back to work the same week she gave birth so maybe she is unable to parent at all", "Yup, said this in comment, asking for a few hours so they can go on a date or just sleep for a few hours with less stress is one thing, asking you to basically not work and be a free nanny so they can go to work is ridiculous. If you have family members who aren't or can't work but are able to look after a child that's very different but still a huge thing to ask them to do for long shifts.", "NTA. Are you the parent? Nope? Grandparent? Nope. So, what you\u2019re saying is while you have no kids and want to remain child free? Not responsible for the care of this child? I understand perfectly clear what you\u2019re saying. Say it loud for your mother and brother. I take my grands every Saturday night, so parents can go out.  I CHOSE this because I wanted to create \u201cmemories\u201d, I think you might enjoy a once a month \u201ckid night\u201d as the baby gets older. You get to visit and play and they get a night out. My aunt had no children and we LOVED spending time with her. She was AMAZING! Go live your best life. You aren\u2019t responsible for being anything (except the FUN aunt). You are NTA. \ud83d\ude0a", "It sounds like you need the saying my dad told me when my eldest was born (not that I needed it). \n\nMy dad said \"I am a grandparent NOT a babysitter.\"\n\nThe pretext being he did his job raising me it's his turn to relax and watch me raise my kids. Now of course we have family babysit quite a bit but it usually only happens on their term or emergencies.\n\nMy eldest is 10 amd I have asked my dad to watch my kids 2 and he has volunteered once. The first my eldest was 6mths and the last two times have been in the last year. All three times he was already planning a visit to spend time with the kids and we asked if we could take advantage of it and he knows we don't get to have proper dates anymore so he agrees.\n\nHubby's grandmother used to tell us every school holidays (and at random times before eldest started school) that she was having a sleepover with her grand baby/babies and would tell us when we were dropping off and picking up and we weren't allowed to say anything except \"yes mam\" (well hubby is allowed to reschedule but she sets alternative dates).\n\nWe plan our time away from the kids around everyone else asking for time with our kids. We do not expect people to change their routines to suit us. It sounds like you brother and SIL need to re-evaluate their options because what if something (touch wood) happens to your mother.", "This. This should be higher. If you and me are the village, then do you bring food to my table and fix my house while I'm watching the kids? If not, than its nanny-ing, not village-ing, and I am not a nanny.", "I\u2019m sorry the baby is actually 4 months (may 31st bday). SIL had June and July off. Babysitting started in August and I stopped going about 2 weeks ago. Just clarifying!", "DOG TAX!!"]}
