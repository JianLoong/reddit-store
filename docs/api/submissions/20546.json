The saying no to doing the dishes when you hurt you back is. Possibly more triggering for me as my father died from what was ultimately a bad back initially (in a long convulted way) and have had a slipped disc and fracture myself but this would have me seriously doubting the relationship. If your loved one has a bad back you do whatever you can to help them, as they could injure it further and bad backs are no joke. What reason did she have to not help you? Unless it was a seriously good one I'd say she is selfish and you're probably right that she wouldn't help you out if things were reversed. But also, if you think this of your partner, why would you want to move into a new place with them and continue the relationship? What if you become disabled and can't work anymore?
