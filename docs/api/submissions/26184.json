This is a bottomless pit of petty on sister's part.", "Especially after reading the fact that he physically and mentally abused you during childhood and your sister tells you \"not to change the memories of her childhood,\" when you try to discuss it with her is utterly disgusting and worrisome.  NTA in any capacity", "I guess there is like a general sense of just it being normal to ask \"Was everyone ok??\" in an accident. \n\nI would just apologize and say \"Look, me and him are had an argument and I didn't want to bring him up because of that. I didn't mean to come across as callous. I don't wish any ill will on him and I'm glad everyone is alright.\"", "NTA. Absolutely bizarre the number of people who don't seem to understand that going no contact with someone usually is for a very good reason and goes hand in hand with not really caring about them whatsoever. Frankly it would be weirder if you DID care what happened to someone you intentionally cut out of your life. Also from the sounds your stepfather was driving and likely at fault for the accident, which goes to show how little he cared about the safety of his passengers.", "Debating whether your sister and co. are at fault here, so I'll prod you for 1 piece of **INFO**:\n\nDo they know about your rifts with your stepdad?", "NTA by a long shot", "NTA imo, because you don\u2019t have a relationship with him. Being \u201crelated\u201d doesn\u2019t necessitate feelings/concern, regardless of what her opinion is.  That\u2019d be like if you expected her to disassociate with him because he offended you. Not a reasonable expectation. \nMaybe she\u2019s having some postnatal depression and extra feelings, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll get over it.", "I don't think it's an issue not caring about him. I mean he's not your real father and you guys are no contact so I don't see what the issue is.", "It is a bit callous. I'm no contact with my grandfather (huge AH, though now completely senile) but I would still inquire after him if he had an accident. Cautious NAH.", "Going against the grain and voting ESH here.\n\nYou are an asshole \u2018cause your stepdad is a human being.  A little compassion will go a long way.\n\nYour sister is an asshole for getting angry with you about someone you have a low opinion of.  She needs to stay out of it, period.\n\nBut the biggest asshole is obviously your stepdad for his homophobia.  That he still has a lot of damage cleanup to handle.", "This is a tough one. I would go with NTA. I don't know what was said between you two to make you go no contact and homophobia is awful. But people are deeply flawed and I believe we can be angry at them and even be no contact and still care about their well being. You didn't ask but that actually doesn't necessarily mean deep down you don't care. Idk. I don't think yta but I also feel you could have asked to be polite but depending on what was said or the past relationship idk.", "YTA - You don't have to care if he was hurt because you care about him. You should care if he was hurt because it would be traumatizing to your sister who was in the accident with him.", "It seems that you're concerned about your sister's family and indifferent about your stepfather. Asking about just the people you cared about gives a **NAH**, but it's still not a good look to leave out stepfather, even if only for sake of curiosity.", "YTA - Having a complete lack of empathy over someone's potential near death experience, kind of makes you an asshole. You can't really take the moral high ground whilst thinking he deserves physical harm as a form of Karma.", "YTA. It is one thing being no contact. It is another not caring if they are alive or hurt...", "It's rough because obviously no one should condone or encourage homophobia at all, however with that said it sounds like this crash whilst mild could have been far worse for everyone involved, and it does seem unnecessarily callous to specifically avoid asking about your stepdad, especially if there was never really a big rift besides the homophobic comments and you otherwise had a good relationship, even more so if he actually raised you and treated you well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
