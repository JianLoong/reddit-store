I thought it best to double check that I\u2019d get my full steak so I asked if she was going to try any of mine. She said yes so I called the server and asked for an extra portion. My sister was extremely put off that I ordered another steak just because she wanted to try mine. I explained I wanted my full plate, she could have as much of the extra order as she liked and I\u2019d pack the rest for later. She was not happy with that. It really threw off the vibe of our meal together. We made small talk but it seemed like two annoyed strangers tolerating each other rather than family catching up. Later I learnt my sister was extremely upset and she has brought this up with many family members. She has said I acted like a selfish AH and a few family members have agreed that not sharing with family is an AH move. I\u2019m struggling to understand this. I am sharing because I\u2019m paying for the extra portion. I\u2019m just not sharing my plate but they do get to try everything I\u2019m eating. In the situation with my sister, there was a full extra steak that I paid for and she could have as much as she wanted. How is that selfish?

I think your sister is salty because she feels called out. You know your family likes to graze off other people's plates and accommodated their grabby ways. They know they're being rude and tacky and don't want to get exposed at a fancy restaurant.", "NTA, but - how many people are asking you to share? Is it the same small group? I ask because I have gone out for dinner thousands of times in my life and been asked to share an entree maybe twenty of those, and by my significant other no less.\n\n\"No\" is a complete sentence and if people are not respecting your \"no,\" then stop eating out with them. There is no need to keep buying additional entrees nor is there any expectation in polite company that you should share your food.", "NTA but have you considred saying \"I don't like sharing food?\"", "NTA-you are not obligated to share your food. It is generous for you to pay for food for other people to eat. If they don\u2019t like eating from the share plate, there is something wrong with them, not you. \n\nStop going to dinner with people who don\u2019t respect your boundaries.", "Question,  why not just tell people no that you don't share food?", "INFO So if you don't like people eating off your plate because they touch the food with their fork after it's been in their mouth, how can you buy a second order of food and take it home after they took bites to \"have tasty take-away or leftovers\" later if they've touched it with their saliva covered forks? \n\nSo basically why does it bother you when it happens in a restaurant but you can take the food home and eat it and that doesn't bother you?", "A lot of people aren't going to understand what you are going through op. I get it, although I don't have this problem with food, I feel very strongly about people drinking from my water bottle. I don't know why every single person in my life tries to drink from it, even people who I am not close with by any means. It's especially bothersome with family because I tell them repeatedly not to touch my water bottle (they only touch it cuz they're going to drink it, I don't have a problem with actually touching it) but they ignore my boundary repeatedly. I have bought every single family member the exact same water bottle and they specifically still reach for mine.\n\nYou're doing everything you can to make sure people are not getting offended and they're getting offended because you are not letting them cross your boundary.\n\n\nNTA", "Lol nta...she tried your food just not from your plate and she mad mad....I'd do the same thing if i could afford to....i don't like sharing either except with my niece..but at the same time when i do share i just take off a pice from my plate and pass it to the person with usually an appetizer plate left on the table...that way they don't touch your food.(also its the proper way to share and pass food so others don't actively eat from your plate).", "NTA. You are not being selfish. In fact, I think it's very generous of you to literally order and pay for two of everything so that others can have food that they didn't order. While yes it is a bit odd to do this, it's not hurting anyone (other than your wallet), so you do you. To me it is your meal companions who demand some of your food who are the AHs - if they want something, they should order it. Also your sister and your family are AHs for complaining about this. They should have gratitude that you're offering them a second meal to take from.", "NTA. Short answer: Some people can never be happy unless they can find something to complain or feel like the victim about. This describes your sister to a T, as in \"TA.\" Do what makes YOU feel good.", "Extra info: tf how much are people eating from your plate where you have to order an entire portion again ? My friends and I just take one bite of each other\u2019s food and it\u2019s fine", "Yeah, NTA...\n\nYou're a little obsessively weird about not sharing your food, but you've found a really good solution that solves your pet peeve without making things weirder for others... really over the top solution... it should be enough to simply say \"I really don't like to share my food, it's just a big pet peeve I have...\" and people should respect that... but good on you for what you do...\n\nSo I really can't wrap my head around why your sister or anyone would be upset here...", "NTA. As someone who hates sharing but grew up in a culture that had family-style dinners all the time, I hear ya. What worked for me was being direct and just declaring right off the bat that I'm ordering only for myself, even if that meant I was the only person at the table with their own dish while everyone else shared. Your compromise is pretty generous but clearly these family members are not satisfied. I say ignore them and keep on doing your own thing.", "NTA - as long as you are paying your own way, it doesn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t matter to your dining group what or how you order.", "NTA\u2026 you\u2019re the one paying for it, I don\u2019t think you should also have to pay for their unreasonably hurt feelings too.", "NTA, while it\u2019s not necessarily the \u201cnorm\u201d to order an extra portion because somebody wants to try a bite of your food, the fact that you are paying for yourself I think makes you not the asshole.\n\nIf you became aggressive because someone asked to try your food or insisted on splitting the bill 50/50 I would feel differently. While it\u2019s not wrong for you to say no and not want to share, it is in a way a-hole to refuse to share, and you can be justified in your actions and still be the \u201ca-hole.\u201d\n\nHowever, I\u2019m surprised your sister wasn\u2019t already used to the way that you order and go about sharing. The fact that she acted shocked and then went around complaining to all of your family members is awful no matter which way you slice it, so she is definitely the asshole. \n\nOn a separate note, I completely understand your concern about germs. Have you tried cutting off a piece of your dish that others have wanted to try, and putting it on a plate to avoid anyones cutlery touching yours? That might be a good solution in the event it wasn\u2019t an item you were tracking calorie wise.", "[Hey Joey. NTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCCzzZVVpIA)", "Im sorry but wtf is a cousin sister?", "NTA", "NTA.  In your history with cousin-sister, she likely has an established pattern of demanding your food. You are not comfortable with sharing your food, which is a reasonable boundary. You have made reasonable and generous steps to accommodate her requests which, while they may be regarded as \u201cquirky\u201d, do not inconvenience her or add to her expenses. \n \nHer insisting on eating the specific food from your plate is entitled and demanding.  The support from your extended family likely has to do with family culture of sharing food and other things, which is its own can of worms.  You could ask her what other solution she might propose\u2014given that she can have no part of anything that is on your designated-that-night-dinnerplate.", "It's a little unusual, but definitely NTA.  If you were selfish, you wouldn't pay for a whole extra portion in case someone else wanted any.  So also not selfish.  It's just a little odd socially is all, but don't see why anyone would get upset over it.", "NTA and WTF are they calling you selfish for??? You purchased the entire dinner, AND got extra so she could try it.", "NTA-just stop going out to eat with people who don\u2019t respect your boundaries. It\u2019s crazy that people think they have to right to pick off your plate. Add to that that everyone is talking to each other behind your back instead of directly to you, which makes all of them AHs. Probably should give your family a break from dining with you for a bit since they can\u2019t treat you with basic respect.\n\nWhen this situation presents itself again, know that ordering an extra plate is weird way to solve this issue. Instead, don\u2019t ask what your dining partner plans to do. You can solve this by simply stating that you prefer he/she not eat off your plate because it weirds you out from a hygiene perspective. Say this when your food arrives. That is a much more culturally acceptable compromise, especially post-Covid era.", "You're nicer about it than other people I know. My ex husband still has a scar on his hand from his brother stabbing him with a fork when he tried to take his food.", "NTA for ordering another portion since you are paying for it. But one of your issues was people contaminating the food. If there's any extra from the additional entr\u00e9e, why are you now okay eating it?", "NTA, but how do the issues of saliva contamination and increased difficulty logging your calories, etc. go away when you eat the leftovers later from the portion that other people tried?", "Joey doesn\u2019t share food!\n\nNTA. You pay for it. You\u2019re then willing to share the extra portion.", "NTA. I get it man I don\u2019t like people eating off my plate and I don\u2019t like sharing drinks especially. If you are paying for an extra portion I don\u2019t see how this is problem at all and it\u2019s honestly strange for other people to complain about you buying them free food when they were going to eat part of your portion.", "NTA - quite frankly I think you need to be a bit more TA. Just tell people to not eat your fucking food lol. I am a huge food sharer (I will team order with friends so we can share two dishes), but it's perfectly ok to not want people touching your meal.", "Sister is mad because you\u2019re denying her the intimacy and closeness of sharing from your own plate, even if she\u2019s not aware of that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. Neither that or order an extra portion (which is beyond generous and shouldn\u2019t be required) makes you an asshole. NTA.", "NTA You are actually being very considerate. How can they say you are being selfish when you are buying their meal and providing extra on top of that. If anyone is being selfish it is your family. They are putting their feelings of entitlement to what is on your plate, before your feelings of wanting to eat your food undisturbed.\n\nStop going out to eat with people who don't respect you. You have every right to object to people putting their utensils in your food.\n\nHave you explained to them why you object to them eating off your plate? That would be a good place to start. I would also explain that it is unsanitary, and makes you uncomfortable.\n\nThere is no way you are being selfish. Your family is very rude for expecting to eat off your plate when there is an identical one available, and for calling you selfish, when you expect nothing but their company, and they get a meal paid for and another one to sample.\n\nYou could order exactly what they do, and then get what your really want to go. That would fix their little red wagon.\n\nETA: Ask for extra sets of cutlery, and an extra plate. Then portion out what they want on the extra plate. That way nothing gets contaminated.", "NTA- your mistake with asking if they intended to have any of your food. You should have said \u201csis, order what you would like to eat because I\u2019m going to eat what I ordered and I do not intend to share.\u201d", "I guess NAH but this isn\u2019t typical behavior.", "YTA. Asking her if she wants to try your food and than not giving her something of your food is weird. It puts her in a totally weird spot that you now pay extra because she wanted a tiny bite of yours, that YOU offered to her.\n\nPlus: you do realize that her saliva would be on the extra steak too, right?!", "YTA\n\n> so I asked if she was going to try any of mine.\n\nThis sounds like you were offering to let her try yours, and then took extreme steps when she accepted the offer you made!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I do not want to share food from my plate and as a grown up, I can make that choice.

Why is it okay when the cooties are a day old?", "NTA. I absolutely can't stand people wanting to eat off my plate and I make it very much known that this doesn't happen with me. I don't know how she was so offended by this. It's an AH move to tell someone you'll be eating off their plate and expect them to be okay with it.
