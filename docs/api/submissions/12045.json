If your friends wanted (or needed) the convenience and cost-savings of a car, then they could have also driven. They chose to fly. It\u2019s not their fault that the flight was delayed, and family chauffeurs are unavailable. But it is their problem to solve, not yours. They are free to ask for a ride, but they should be respectful of your answer. If they can\u2019t afford the $50 for an Uber/ taxi, then they shouldn\u2019t have spent the extra money to fly in the first place. Are they giving their unavailable family members a hard time, too? Have they offered you any compensation for the ride? They are acting entitled.", "NTA\n\nYou are not their airport shuttle service. Flights are often delayed, and they need to make other arrangements, even if it costs them $50 each. \n\nMultiple post-midnight, 2-hour round-trip shuttle service trips after two days of driving is a big ask, especially when you chose to drive in order to save money.

You and your friends are tired from that long trip. If they want to get home they should rent a car or they can wait in the airport till morning till they have a ride home. Your nta for not wanting to spend more time on the road.", "NTA - Their own families won\u2019t do it, why should they expect you to?  They can rent a car or Uber, not your problem.", "NTA - They chose to fly, they can make their arrangements to and from the airport. You\u2019ve already driven enough\u2026", "NTA. Travel is unpredictable and you need to be prepared for expenses to pop up.", "YTA be a good friend, you\u2019re all on the trip together.

They did not specify whether they\u2019d reimburse for gas / time", "This isn\u2019t just a favor. It\u2019s a huge inconvenience. Two hours of driving at midnight after having already driven 11 hours that day. I sincerely doubt these friends would do this \u201cfavor\u201d for OP.", "Op never said they would get gas money out of the deal. They also said multiple round trips, due to the amount of people. So that could easily mean 4-6 hours driving for their friends, after an 11 hour day of driving already. If they arrived at 9 pm, and their friends arrive at midnight, that could mean they're still on the roads at 4 or 5 am. Thats ridiculously late and potentially also very unsafe if they're exhausted from a long day of driving. Additionally, that much driving, depending on gas costs of multiple trips, isn't that much cheaper than the Uber would be. Thats a big inconvenience to everyone who drove and could be dangerous because of how tired everyone is.", "Are you kidding? 2 hours round trip at midnight after OP\u2019s already driven 11 hours that day? Nope. They can take an Uber.", "Also he said multiple trips. So at least 4 hours after driving 11. Get an Uber.", "Two hours driving for a friend isn\u2019t that big a deal - or shouldn\u2019t be in normal circumstances. The only thing that tips this is that OP will be exhausted from two long days to get there, and it wouldn\u2019t be safe - and would impact on the next day so it reasonable to say no because of that. \n\nNTA.", "Most favors are huge inconveniences. I didn\u2019t say OP was wrong for not picking up his friends. I\u2019m just saying that OP shouldn\u2019t get selective amnesia if they\u2019re ever in a position to need help from their friends.", "Cool story. I don\u2019t really care.

Will you pick up my mail while I\u2019m out of town? Can you water my plants? I\u2019m sick -can you bring me Gatorade?
