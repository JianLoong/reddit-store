You don't ask someone to make you food if you are not going to eat it.", "INFO: Did she explain why she ordered food while you were cooking for her?", "NTA Your gf is. She's also rude. You go through the trouble of making her dinner and instead of saying thank you she orders in food instead? The next time she's hungry tell her to either cook it herself or order it in since she obviously doesn't appreciate your efforts.", "NAH. Did you ask if she even wanted you to cook for her? She may have just wanted a kebab instead of pasta.", "NTA.  Not only was it wrong, but completely inconsiderate.", "If she ate it with your food, then I guess I don't see the issue? NAH", "INFO: how long were you making pasta for? If she had time to get annoyed from waiting, order and get it delivered before you finished harvesting the grain that's on you.\n\nHangry people do not like to wait for hours.", "She was quite upset from work and was in her words \u2018out of it\u2019 so I don\u2019t think she thought it through.", "It was a kebab, so not really.", "Does it matter? She's still an asshole for not ever telling OP, and letting him find out when the food gets there.", "No she didn\u2019t, but she did offer me half the kebab.", "She said she\u2019d been paying for her last Uber order and decided she wanted a certain food.", "It says in the post she asked him to cook\u2026 do you not read the post before commenting?", "> I went over to hers and we spoke about it for a while and eventually we drove to my place and she asked me to make her food.\n\nI love it when people ask questions that the OP already answered in his post", "She asked me to cook.", "My girl also has those days after a rough day of work. Sometimes she just needs to shut her brain off for a while. So yeah you\u2019re NTA, I would also still be annoyed if she ordered, but I\u2019d cut her some slack because she probably wasn\u2019t thinking and didn\u2019t mean to upset you. Did she still eat the pasta?", "Can't beat a small doner on a bed of penne", "Ok, so yes a little inconsiderate for not just saying, Hey, I'm going to order a kebab, I'm really hungry. But I absolutely am going to eat your meal too and I really appreciate you cooking. Or something along those lines.", "NTA. She ordered herself a kebab and not you one? After asking you to make food. \n\nNot sure that it\u2019s hard to understand, your gf is being unreasonable", "NTA. This is super rude and she's being incredibly dismissive. She had to consciously decide to open the app, search for food, order it, pay for it, and pick up up from the delivery person. But she claims she was so \"out of it\" she could consciously do this all without thinking once about the fact that you're making food for her.\n\nThat's incredibly selfish of her to not order any food for you. And she comes across as having zero empathy if she doesn't realize why you're upset. Ether she's got no empathy, is a literal child, or she's not telling the truth. To me, that's a sign of a huge underlying issue; there's a fundamental lack of awareness, respect, care, and empathy that's blatantly obvious from her actions.\n\nI think this is something you really have to get to the bottom of; if she can't understand why you'd be upset, then you can't be in a relationship with someone that has such a limited ability to understand the consequences of her actions.", "NTA. Unless it was dessert or something that pairs with the pasta you were making, but from other comments it sounds like it was a kebab.\n\nMy MIL will often see me making dinner and then start cooking something completely different and far less healthy for my son. Drives me bonkers. You are NTA.", "Ultimately, I think OP is NTA, but this crossed my mind as well. OP says he's making *pasta*, but GF has food delivered before he is done? Was he baking a lasagna? Is he working with like a single hot plate or something?", "How long did it take for you to make the Pasta?", "Isn't kebab meat? And pasta is carbs? While they might not traditionally go together, it's two different food groups. I'm often exhausted after work and have strong needs for protein and carbs.", "Wow, did she just forget you were there? Insane that she has no idea why you\u2019re upset. No matter which way you look at it it was a jerk move:\n\nShe knew you were cooking, ordered take out anyway - jerk move.\nForgot you were cooking but knew you were there and didn\u2019t get you anything - jerk move.\nForgot you were there entirely - jerk move.\n\nI understand having bad days and not thinking, but then an apology is in order *at minimum*.", "Info:  \u2018making pasta\u2019; like, 15-20mins start to finish tomato/cream sauce slop thing or 4hr lasagne where you made the pasta from flour, blanche tomatoes etc etc etc", "INFO: did she eat the food you made too? if so NAH. The hangry stomach wants what it wants.", "NTA. Who does this?\n\nIf what you were making was time consuming (like\nlasagna or if you made the pasta from scratch), I would understand her ordering food as an appetizer, but even then, it would only be fair to order food for both of you.", "nta", "Still no reply. Replied to others, so I\u2019m going to assume she wanted something to shove into her starving face and he wanted to spend a nice evening constructing a delectable meal.  \n\nPoor communication all around, ESH.", "Can you read?", "She forgot you were cooking dinner, while you were cooking?", "At OP's own house!!!! How the hell do you order food to someone else's house and not ask if they want some?", "I can\u2019t tell if you were joking but this legit sounds banging lmao"]}
