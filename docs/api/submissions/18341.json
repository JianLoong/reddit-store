Two years ago, Lola begged for a dog because she was fourteen and all of her friends had their own pets. I pointed out to Lola that she asked for a betta fish when she was younger but ended up ignoring it, and ask how we knew that wouldn\u2019t happen twice. Lola said it would be different this time because fish are boring and she really wants a dog.\n\nI told Lola that was a terrible reason. Every pet eventually becomes \u201cboring\u201d after you get used to it and the novelty wears off. If you\u2019re going to choose to have a living animal be fully dependent on you, then it being \u201cboring\u201d is no excuse to not take care of it. But my husband Alex said that he had the same thought process when he was Lola\u2019s age, and when he actually got his own dog, it was different and he always took care of it.\n\nAfter Lola promised us that she would completely handle the dog\u2019s care and that me and Alex would not be taking over in any capacity, we let her adopt a dachshund named Nutmeg. Lola took great care of Nutmeg for the first few months but then started to gradually care less and less. In the last year, it was very common for Nutmeg not to have any food or water and for Lola to throw a fit when I reminded her to do it. On multiple different occasions, I swapped out Nutmeg\u2019s bag of food with an unopened one. I made sure Nutmeg was fed in the meantime and asked Lola if she remembered to feed Nutmeg. Lola lied to me multiple times, claiming she fed Lola when the bag in the pantry was not even opened. Lola has completely ignored Nutmeg for the last four months.\n\nMy sister visits us fairly often, along with my niece and nephew, Alise and Jaime. Alise and Jaime love Nutmeg. They constantly came over to play with her and had truly been taking care of her more than Lola had for the past year. Because my talks with Lola about responsibility were going completely ignored, I spoke with my sister and agreed that Nutmeg would live with them and now be Alise and Jaime\u2019s dog.\n\nIt took a week for Lola to even notice Nutmeg was missing. Lola was angry and told me I had no right to give away her dog. I told Lola that Nutmeg wasn\u2019t her dog anymore because she wasn\u2019t taking care of it. Lola promised that me and her father would not have to take over Nutmeg\u2019s care, and she broke our agreement by neglecting Nutmeg. She ignored all the talks I had with her about responsibility. Lola can walk three blocks to her aunt\u2019s house and visit Nutmeg anytime. But Nutmeg is now Alise and Jaime\u2019s dog because they\u2019re taking care of her.\n\nAlex said that he knows Lola can take a minute-long walk and visit Nutmeg anytime. But that Nutmeg was still her dog for two years and I was wrong to just give Nutmeg away without notice. I believe that Lola not realizing Nutmeg was missing for a week shows she didn\u2019t care about the dog. But is my husband right that I was too harsh and should have let Lola have more of a say in the matter of what was done with Nutmeg?", "created_utc": 1685248340, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13treqb/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_the_dog_isnt/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My dog send the night with my parents sometimes and we miss him within the hour and are ready for him to come home. My husband won\u2019t even have been home 5min before asking where he is", "NTA. She does not deserve to have that dog if she's not going to take care of it. Good for you for not enabling abuse.", ">It took a week for Lola to even notice Nutmeg was missing.\n\nThis is the line that lets you 100% off of the AH hook.  NTA", "NTA. She was lying and saying she fed the dog when she didn\u2019t. That\u2019s some horrible animal neglect. Not noticing she was gone for a week is also terrible! I think it\u2019s a good life lesson and I\u2019m happy Nutmeg is in a better home.", "NTA your husband needs to take a hard look at his morals. His precious daughter isn\u2019t entitled to abuse a dog. And that\u2019s exactly what she was doing by not even feeding her! She wouldn\u2019t even admit it when you asked which shows she was willing to let her go hungry to cover her ass. She doesn\u2019t want that dog, she is just angry that she didn\u2019t get her way.", "NTA. You made a deal, she failed to hold up her end. The consequence is that she doesn't get to keep the dog she won't care for.", "NTA-She\u2019s a teenager not a small child. It\u2019s not unreasonable to expect a teenager to care for a pet in every way but financial. The fact that it took her a week to notice the difference is awful.", "NTA\n\nThank you for taking care of Nutmeg when Lola wouldn\u2019t, and acknowledging that Nutmeg will be happier with Lola\u2019s aunt. \n\nI get that it hurts for the child that she wasn\u2019t told and maybe felt like she wasn\u2019t given a second chance, but it should be hurting her more that it took her a week to realise her own dog was missing, she should be upset that she neglected a helpless animal, and she should be grateful that her parents and aunt picked up after her when she wasn\u2019t giving the dog the love it deserves. \n\nHaving a pet is a very serious thing and being a 14/16 year old, I would still expect someone that age to be aware of the pain she would be causing the dog by not giving it enough attention and just basic care. \n\nYou gave Lola a chance, and you did the right thing by Nutmeg when Lola dropped the ball. I hope Nutmeg enjoys their new home.", "NTA. It says a lot that it took her an entire week to realise the dog was missing. You were right to give it away. A shame that your husband is more concerned about molly coddling your daughter instead of teaching her about consequences for her actions.", "You're title scared me but now that I read the story, you did right by the dog and I am glad she can play with kids who love her.  NTA", "NTA\n\nShe didn't notice he was gone for a week! That really says it all. Lola shouldn't have a pet.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t notice for A WEEK.", "Just as everyone else said NTA - If it took her a week to notice, then she shouldn't be looking after an animal. Animals dying due to not receiving enough attention from their owners is a real thing, even if you feed, water, and take them to the Vet regularly. \n\nShe's an irresponsible pet owner and I hope your husband realizes it soon.", "NTA No, and you have a husband problem that is probably related to the Lola problem.", "NTA. She was lying that she fed the dog?? She's not like seven she was a teenager...???? What would happen if you didn't feed the dog? She just wouldn't care that it was hungry ??? \n\nUhhhh.... I feel like you have some bigger problems then worrying about giving the dog away. Giving the dog away was in its best interest so it can actually have an interested owner. But your daughter... Doesn't seem to be caring that the dog would starve...? That really seems like the bigger problem here. Something is wrong with her compassion", "NTA, she lied about feeding the dog for a week-she not neglectful, she was abusive, Starving and animal when there is food in the house is abuse!! Not knowing the dog was gone for an entire week.  God help her if she has a child.", "NTA. Next time she wants a pet, get her a rock because that seems to be where her maturity level and skill set sits. She doesn\u2019t get to abuse and waste a life because she\u2019s trying to be cool and hip.", "INFO: What makes you think your niece and nephew will care for the dog properly?  Or is this just an 'it's their problem now' kind of situation?", "ESH. You and your husband suck because you should never, never get a child a dog and think you\u2019ll never have to take care of it. Dogs are one of the biggest responsibilities of any pet. Obviously Lola was very irresponsible and I agree with re-homing the dog. But you and your husband never should have agreed to this.", "ESH. Your daughter for neglecting the dog. You should have talked to your husband about this too before making the decision. And responsible parenting would be warning Lola the dog was going to go away if Lola wasn't caring for her. Your husband sucks too for sticking up for his asshole daughter. \n\nNutmeg deserves better!", " Info: what did you do *as the parent* to assist your daughter in being a good pet owner? Did you make a daily checklist? Have her learn about dog ownership? Or did you expect a **child** to figure it all out on their own?", "Info how old is your daughter", "I'm going to say YTA for believing your child would take full responsibility for the dog.

If you hadn\u2019t kept checking on Nutmeg the neglect would have been full on animal abuse with the dog thirsty, starving and neglected. And no you did not need to discuss it with your daughter or involve her in the decision making. She renounced all her rights to pet ownership long ago.", "NTA. While it's her dog, the fact that a living animal was being kept alive and cared for by you, and she didn't even realise the dog was gone at first goes to show that she was very much neglecting the dog. In a real-world situation where a parent was not 'saving the day's that dog would have starved and it would be called animal abuse. That's the truth of the matter. \nYou would be a bigger AH if you shielded your daughter from the consequences of her actions.", "NTA in the slightest, poor Nutmeg was not being properly taken care of at all! Not only did your daughter lie about feeding her, but it also took her a week to even notice that the dog was gone! It appears that Lola, like most kids/teens her age, wanted the fun of a dog without any of the responsibility.", "My mum's dog passed 6 months ago and I still feel a big empty hole in my heart every time I go to her house and she's not there to greet me. \n\nNutmeg deserves a home where she fills someone's heart. I think OP did the right thing.", "I notice my dog isn't following me into the other room and panic, because that means she fell asleep behind a closed door and got closed behind me before I noticed\ud83d\ude05 a week?!?! 24hrs is standard like yooo this greeting when I got home didn't happen\ud83e\udd72 poor doggo", "This comment deserves gold!!", "Yup and if you indulged her she'd probably end up like my older sister. Abandoned 2 cats her and her ex got at my mom's for over a year. She felt owed having a larger animal because we couldn't have them growing up (apartment/lease rules) but did nothing to take care of them even before she had to move back in with our mom. No vet visits, flea treatments, and my mom would even go to her place after work to tidy up and clean the litter box.\n\nOnce she got her own place and moved out of our mom's she made a million excuses to not reclaim her cats and they essentially became feral. They teamed up to attack me and the other animals in the house, eventually including a 12wk old puppy and she did absolutely nothing. The final breaking point was my mom finding her posting on local community pages looking for a new kitten; she didn't even admit she never wanted to take them until after I'd fought an uphill battle to surrender them to a shelter.\n\nOP you absolutely did the right thing and I really hope she learns from this that pets are living breathing beings with needs instead background dressing.", "Yeah, if it was more \"has to be reminded to feed/walk the dog but still does it\" or not dealing with dog hair around the house or something like that I'd have a different opinion, but this was straight up abuse. The dog is lucky that OP was paying attention and not believing Lola when she said she'd fed her.", ">What makes you think your niece and nephew will care for the dog properly?\n\nAlise and Jaime have shown more responsibility in taking care of Nutmeg for the past year than Lola has. They volunteered to handle even the non-fun aspects of taking care of Nutmeg. Alise and Jaime have never complained or even needed to be reminded about taking care of Nutmeg.\n\nAdditionally, my sister and her husband have time and are willing to take care of Nutmeg too. It was very clear in our agreement that me and Alex didn't have time to take care of the dog, and Lola promised that she would take care of Nutmeg on her own.", "How do you know if someone\u2019s ready for responsibility without entrusting them with it? Caring for a pet is a frequent test of a child\u2019s responsibility and maturation. The parents just have to ensure they\u2019d be an appropriate back up plan.\n\nOP trusted her daughter but provided a back up safety net in that she checked on and ensured the dog was being cared for when her daughter wasn\u2019t, and then rehomed the dog to a place she trusted where the people love Nutmeg. I don\u2019t think OP was irresponsible at all - sometimes you have to take off the training wheels to see if someone will fall but be prepared to step in when something happens. That\u2019s exactly what she did.", " I agree that OP should have discussed with husband; but Lola was not entitled to a warning.  \n\nShe was horribly neglecting the dog to the point of lying about feeding it, which could have endangered its health.  She didn\u2019t even notice the dog was missing for a week, a WEEK.  Even a day would have been insane.  \n\nLola had two years to demonstrate that she could be a responsible pet owner and has failed miserably. Giving her a warning would have, at best, reset the situation to when she first got the dog; i.e, good behavior for a few months and then back to the status-quo.", ">Did you make a daily checklist? Have her learn about dog ownership?\n\nYes. There is a miniature whiteboard on the kitchen fridge listing all of Lola's weekly responsibilities with checkboxes. Lola erased the parts detailing her care of Nutmeg several different times.\n\nWe spoke to Lola about the responsibilities of owning a dog and had her write a short essay on it before letting her adopt Nutmeg. After the first few months of ownership, all the talks about responsibility went ignored.", "She constantly reminded the kid to feed the dog, and they had multiple conversations about it. The kid is 14. She knows that dogs need to be fed.", ">how old is your daughter\n\nLola is currently sixteen. We allowed her to adopt Nutmeg when she was fourteen.", "Says in the post she was 14 at the time they got Nutmeg, 16 when they finally rehomed the dog.", "This \u201cchild\u201d is 16 years old. Old enough to take full responsibility for the dog.", "FYI - the bot counts that as YTA since you put that first.", "Fair response.  NTA", "Ideally the warning comes long before the point of 'let's pretend the dog is getting neglected to see what our daughter does'. But yeah this kid shouldn't have had the dog in the first place. Parents, it's ok to tell your kids no and mean it.", "No, it's even worse.  Lola was 14 when they got the dog 2 years ago.  This is a 16 year old!", "A verbal reminder can easily be ignored. A parent needs to help create and maintain the routine to care for the pet. I think a warning of losing the pet would have been appropriate too.", "Oh my bad I\u2019ll delete it then haha", "She didn't even notice the dog was missing until a week later.", "No need to delete it, editing it should fix it lol"]}
