We booked the holidays months ago and my girlfriend realized just before we had to pack that she was going to get her period when we were there. She isn\u2019t taking any kind of contraception as we do not need to as lesbians so she couldn\u2019t delay her period. I empathised with her as it is never enjoyable to have cramps and hormones messing you up on holidays but usually, I know how to help her so I was positive it was going to be good anyway. \n\nWell, I was wrong.\n\nSince we arrived my girlfriend has been nothing but annoyed at every little thing I do. If we play a game and she loses, she is sulking. If I don\u2019t cuddle her enough, she is sulking. She also snaps at me out of nowhere. I have tried my best to accommodate to her needs by feeding her food, cuddling her, resting a lot instead of visiting places and telling her it\u2019s okay to feel that way. But we are 4 days in and I am just so fed up with her at this point. She is always negative and annoyed. She needs me all the time and doesn\u2019t understand I also need time to breathe.\n\nFor context, I have depression and anxiety and started a new anti-depressant 12 days ago. This holiday was also a way for me to rest and change scenery as I am constantly exhausted and nauseous. I thought she would understand that.\n\nYesterday night was kinda the final straw. We were cuddling in bed and I tickled her to laugh as she usually loves that but instead, she started sulking in the corner of the bed. I thought it was gonna be temporary but it lasted more than one hour. Normally, I come to her when she is like that but it was like the fourth time she was sulking and I didn\u2019t want to force myself.\n\nAt some point, she told me she wanted me to apologize for annoying her with tickles and that she needed me to cuddle her. Otherwise, she won\u2019t stop sulking. I exploded. I told her I was tired with her sulking, that I had feelings too and that I was getting tired of her attitude. I also said she was ruining the trip. She started crying and told me \u00ab\u00a0it\u2019s not my fault I have my period you could be understanding\u00a0\u00bb. \n\nI feel bad now but at the same time, I do not think I am in the wrong either.

It's your vacation too and you want to enjoy it too, she can use her big girl voice and say \"I don't want to be tickled right now\" and move on.
