{"id": 18048, "submission_id": "13qf4zx", "title": "AITA for getting annoyed at my girlfriend because she has her period on our holidays", "selftext": "I (26F) am on holidays with my girlfriend (26F) for one week on an island. We booked the holidays months ago and my girlfriend realized just before we had to pack that she was going to get her period when we were there. She isn\u2019t taking any kind of contraception as we do not need to as lesbians so she couldn\u2019t delay her period. I empathised with her as it is never enjoyable to have cramps and hormones messing you up on holidays but usually, I know how to help her so I was positive it was going to be good anyway. \n\nWell, I was wrong.\n\nSince we arrived my girlfriend has been nothing but annoyed at every little thing I do. If we play a game and she loses, she is sulking. If I don\u2019t cuddle her enough, she is sulking. She also snaps at me out of nowhere. I have tried my best to accommodate to her needs by feeding her food, cuddling her, resting a lot instead of visiting places and telling her it\u2019s okay to feel that way. But we are 4 days in and I am just so fed up with her at this point. She is always negative and annoyed. She needs me all the time and doesn\u2019t understand I also need time to breathe.\n\nFor context, I have depression and anxiety and started a new anti-depressant 12 days ago. This holiday was also a way for me to rest and change scenery as I am constantly exhausted and nauseous. I thought she would understand that.\n\nYesterday night was kinda the final straw. We were cuddling in bed and I tickled her to laugh as she usually loves that but instead, she started sulking in the corner of the bed. I thought it was gonna be temporary but it lasted more than one hour. Normally, I come to her when she is like that but it was like the fourth time she was sulking and I didn\u2019t want to force myself.\n\nAt some point, she told me she wanted me to apologize for annoying her with tickles and that she needed me to cuddle her. Otherwise, she won\u2019t stop sulking. I exploded. I told her I was tired with her sulking, that I had feelings too and that I was getting tired of her attitude. I also said she was ruining the trip. She started crying and told me \u00ab\u00a0it\u2019s not my fault I have my period you could be understanding\u00a0\u00bb. \n\nI feel bad now but at the same time, I do not think I am in the wrong either.

Seriously, she has her period, she\u2019s not on her deathbed.   \n\n\nHonest to god, she sounds like an extraordinarily exhausting person and a comple pain In the ass. I don\u2019t know you , but I am positive you can do better. \n\nNTA", "Honestly I thought this was going to be entitled BF angry at missing vacation sex, but that is not the case.\n\nDoes your BF always get this moody and unpleasant during her periods? Cause honestly it sounds more like she's starting new meds rather than you.\n\nNo one chooses their periods tines, especially if its irregular,  but most women learn to manage it. What you're describing isn't remotely normal.\n\nNTA", "NTA and I think everyone knows it's not the fact of having her period, it's how she decides to cope with it. If it's always that mood-destroying (and/or painful), there are medications she should be on, no? In any case, it's not your fault or responsibility to manage her.\n\nSounds like she is choosing to sulk and ruin the vacation. In your place I'd probably stop catering to her entirely. That may not be the best advice for a relationship you want to keep, though. I just got so sick of partners that pulled this emotional manipulation garbage, I kind of lost my patience with it years ago.", "NTA, periods are no fun they can be very painful and it can be easier to get annoyed because a plethora of things during a period, that said you are not upset that she had her period you are upset that she seems to think only her feelings are valid and expecting you to do all the emotional support while she gets to throw fits and wallow. It's your vacation too and you want to enjoy it too, she can use her big girl voice and say \"I don't want to be tickled right now\" and move on. Her sulking in the corner does not do anyone any good. Periods are not an excuse to treat others poorly which is what she is doing. Best of luck op hope your vacation turn into something better", "NTA but she sounds exhausting.", "NTA big big time. Having periods isn't an excuse for suddenly behave like a preschooler, it's not her fault but it doesn't sounds like she's making any effort either, hormones hits hard yes, but if you don't even try to reason and use this as a get out of jail free card, that is her fault.\n\n  \n(Also I wonder if this behavior is not just being enabled by years of people accepting to be her doormat whenever she drops the P word)", "NTA, I'm sorry but your gf seems to have the maturity of a toddler.", "INFO: \n\nDoes she know how you are feeling with your new medication? Has she asked? Have you told her unprompted?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like it is all me me me for her at the moment, but I am not clear if she think she is the only one struggling with the way her body is making her feel right now.", "NTA I don't think being on period is excuse for bad behavior, even more so you are a lady yourself and know what she is going through.", "NTA, she sounds extremely selfish and it's not normal behavior while being on your period (I myself am a woman).", "What the Hell?? She needs cuddles or she sulks? Needs to be fed? I would just leave. Screw the money. This is ridiculous bordering on abuse. NTA", "NTA\n\nHow you made it four days dealing with that behaviour is beyond me. Period's suck. Mine are horrific. But I'm also an adult and deal with it like an adult. Tell her to grow up. It's unacceptable to regress into a toddler just because you're on holiday.", "NTA. Is weaponized menstruation a thing? Because that\u2019s what this sounds like if it is.", "NTA if she is more grumpy than usual when she is on her period. However probably she is more stressed because she is mad/sad that she is on her period during the vacation. You need to talk from the bottom of your heart to be able to enjoy the rest of the vacation.\n\nI don't know where are you from but in my country there is a medication (not birt control) that can be used to postpone period for like a week. It's 7 or 10 pills you have to take day by day before your period. I don't remember the details as I used it once 11 years ago but it was safe enough to be used by a 14-year-old teenager. Check it up.", "NTA. She's being completely over the top. When you get back you may want to consider telling her to go to a doctor to see if she has PMDD or PME, because this is going well beyond pms. There's either an underlying issue, or she's being extra for the fuck of it.", "NTA is this her normal period behaviour? If it isn't, I'd be looking to see if something else is up", "NTA. Very immature behaviour. If you have to deal with that on a monthly basis, I'd be tapping out of that shit. Out of curiosity, did your health decline once the honeymoon period of being together was over? I'm wondering if she's playing a larger role in your decline in health than you realise. I mention it because I was unwell in a previous relationship, and improved quite dramatically once it was over.", "At first I was going to say YTA cos obviously we don't chose when our period comes.\nBut her having stripes and acting weird is more then just her period, by say 4 she will be fine. But by the sounds of it she is acting like this for another reason, not her period....", "ESH.\nWhy would you start your new medication right before the trip? That's just bad planning. \n\nYour gf also sucks. She can't help how she feels but she can help how she behaves. I know it's hard, I have PMDD, so it's not always so simple, but it sounds like she's not even trying to apologise.", "You're an asshole for exploding at her and an asshole for expecting her to just not have bodily functions. It seems like you could simply reschedule your holidays (I'm assuming you mean vacations) to be more accommodating of her. However, she's also an asshole for being an asshole.\n\nYou're both assholes. Just a couple of assholes.\n\nYou go apologize to her now for being an asshole, and she should apologize to you, too, but don't expect it and don't let her failure to apologize make you more pissy.\n\nYou're not really assholes. People lose their mental patience all the time and yell at each other, but try to be nicer, okay", "NTA periods suck but it\u2019s a normally bodily function and it\u2019s not an excuse to act like a petulant child. Sometimes you have to pull it together and make the best of a situation when you\u2019re on your period otherwise it\u2019s no fun for anyone. You tried to accommodate her however you could, and instead of communicating with you like an adult she just kept sulking and making things harder than they needed to be. You probably shouldn\u2019t have exploded, it would have been better to explain your frustration a bit more calmly, but I can kind of get it.", "YTA,\n\nyour girlfriend can't actually control times of her period, and you should knows this.", "YTA and now you know what guys have to deal with. Its not like she chose to have her periods at the same time and as a lady you should know better than anyone how it feels.", "YTA - you\u2019re also a woman with periods and understand better than half the population how that can be. Hormonal changes are hard to control sometimes.", "If you want to discuss how someone is poorly handling a situation is one thing...\n\nBut you seem to be a woman complaining about a woman who can't control her monthly cycle.  It's one thing if a clueless man doesn't understand how a woman's period works.  But you don't have that rock to hide behind.\n\nSo because YOU are blaming everything on a woman's natural cycle, I'm giving a YYA.", "ESH I was going to suggest feeding her to improve her mood however I see you did try that. Periods can be rough to deal with but she sucks for sulking. You suck for getting upset about her having her period on holiday although I understand you are frustrated because of her sulking all the time.
