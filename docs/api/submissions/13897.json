It\u2019s not normal to be unable to offer a quick kiss to your partner, let alone to find it annoying \u2026", "NAH - I\u2019m F but I get like this in the morning. I don\u2019t wanna talk or have kisses or cuddles, my brain isn\u2019t working and I wanna get ready and scroll mindlessly through news before leaving for work, it just makes me feel awkward. However I communicated this with my partner and we figured it out. If it\u2019s important to you talk to him, explain how it is and maybe he will be open to even give you a hug hug and forehead kiss before he leaves.", "NAH\n\nSounds like he\u2019s not a morning conversational person. Not an AH for that\n\nYou\u2019re not an AH asking for a kiss, but understand that you guys may be incomparable for these types of morning interactions.", "NTA. If it\u2019s important to you, your partner should be able to recognize this importance and give you what you need. This is such a small thing. Seems like a power move by him maybe? Doesn\u2019t seem healthy, whatever this is.", "Nah - possibly. Is he like this the rest of the time or just in the mornings? Some people simply aren't morning people - and any change to their routine gets them off kilter. You are not wrong to want affection, but him not wanting to give it may have nothing to do with you.", "NTA.\n\nMy husband isn\u2019t a morning person\u2014not in the slightest. When we first started sleeping over and he wouldn\u2019t talk to me before work/while we got ready, I\u2019d assume the worst and that he was giving me the silent treatment because I did something wrong. (The effects of growing up in an abusive, dysfunctional household) \n\nNope, he\u2019s just not a morning person. Trouble waking up, scrolls on his phone for two minutes too long, gets dressed in a hurry, but still comes back to the bedroom in a hurry to kiss me on the temple before he leaves. More often than not, if he forgets for some reason, I\u2019ll usually get a kiss emoji. It really doesn\u2019t take much.", "NAH but that definitely seems weird to me", "Meh, NAH necessarily but you should respect your partner's space. \n\nHe can withdraw consent to physical affection at any point.\n\nI understand your position and how it can be hurtful to you, but when someone doesn't give consent to a kiss or any physical touching in general, it should be respected. Don't pester about it.", "NAH.\n\nI can kind of be weirdly the same: I'm one of the most affectionate people you'll ever meet, but the moment my partner says something like 'I want a kiss every morning when you wake up' or 'when you leave for work' or whatever schedule, well, it's not affection any more, it's a scheduled chore.  It doesn't mean anything other than 'I have to do this or she'll get mad/pout/make my life difficult.'\n\nHe has to learn how to communicate love and affection in a way that you'll hear it, but you also need to learn how to hear his normal ways of communicating love and affection, not tell him 'you're doing it wrong.'\n\nAnd some people aren't morning people.  Some people aren't night owls.  Some people need their morning routine to get psyched up to face work and the day.  Some people wake up raring to go.\n\nHave a damn conversation with the guy, and see if you can come to some sort of compromise or something.", "I don't like physical affection in the morning. It would feel like a chore to me if i had to do it. Can you compromise? Like a verbal \"love you\" when he leaves? Or smthg else he is fine with that shows you his love?", "Honestly I really don\u2019t want to be harsh\u2026but. My husband and I have screamed bloody murdered at each other in the mornings sometimes. Yet we still will say goodbye, kiss, say sorry and will talk when we get home after we\u2019ve cooled down. And we always do. You need to pay attention to this red flag that is waving right in your face. The man doesn\u2019t want to kiss you good bye. You dote on him all everyday he gets home? He\u2019s giving you zero affection. Wake up hon, this isn\u2019t love.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

To make up for lack of income, I keep the house clean and even tend to my bf when he gets home by rubbing his back, feet, etc. I have a very simple job to do while looking for work, and I don\u2019t mind doing it. All I ask in return is affection. Not bombarding affection, just five minutes to cuddle occasionally, occasional intimacy, and a goodbye kiss before he leaves for work. For some reason, my bf claims morning as \u201chis time\u201d and doesn\u2019t even take a second to kiss me goodbye, even when I come to him. He claims he\u2019s in a rush, but he always wakes up early enough to quickly get dressed, brush his teeth, and still have time to scroll on his phone. He considers it such a chore when I come up to him just to kiss him goodbye before he leaves, and claims I\u2019m taking up his personal time with a trivial thing. It hurts my feelings. He has the mindset to not leave the house angry, because if something were to happen, anger shouldn\u2019t be the last thing felt during your last moments together. I have a similar mindset in wanting to feel love when he or I leaves the house, because what if that\u2019s the last kiss we share? I know it\u2019s such a small thing, but it matters to me. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is not my place to comment on the relationship choices of others but please ask yourself if you are truly happy here and what you actually get from this relationship. \n\nI think you should approach an impartial, trustworthy individual and ask their opinion also as they will know the pair of you and would be able to advise and guide with much more clarity than that of internet strangers. \n\nI wish you well.", "Soft YTA. What 'feels right' for you doesn't always feel right to another person. You're dating someone who was honest about how he likes his morning routine, he explained his boundary.  Why is YOUR routine 'right' and his 'wrong'?   He's not saying that he doesn't love you; he's not saying that he won't cuddle you or show you affection; he's just saying that he doesn't want to do the Goodbye Kiss drama scene *in the mornings,* he's not a morning person and he wants his personal space. If this is the hill you want to die on, you may want to get couples counseling, because changing his Mindset on this must come from within - this isn't something you can successfully force.  Otherwise, accept him for who he is or move on.", ">He has the mindset to not leave the house angry, because if something were to happen, anger shouldn\u2019t be the last thing felt during your last moments together.\n\nSimilar to how you say you'd rather not have anger as your last moments of something happened, I'd rather it be the last moment of someone I loved to be knowing I was loved. A simple kiss goodbye isn't taking up more than what, 5-10 seconds of your morning? Yeah it maybe a small annoyance every morning but honestly if it's that annoying just do it and move on with your day is the way he should be looking at it. He should know even if work is taxing and he's tired knowing it's time to go to work, at least he's got someone loving and they are trying their best to make life a little easier. \n\nNTA. He sounds like he just hates having to get up and go to a job I'm going to guess he absolutely hates and he's taking it out on others.", "NTA but are you sure he\u2019s not holding resentment towards you for not working? Seems he\u2019s being quite harsh and drawing boundaries that weren\u2019t there before just because he can. It may also be that he feels uncomfortable with affection if he\u2019s feeling overwhelmed, either by his work, him being the only one working, or maybe you\u2019ve been \u201cneedier\u201d to him during your period of unemployment and he\u2019s unconsciously using this kissing and affection thing to take back his feeling of being an individual. When you mention you\u2019ve been doing housework and then taking care of him when he comes home by massaging him, is this something he asked for or you did out of love? It might be that he\u2019s feeling overwhelmed by all this sudden attention and it can feel like pressure. \nWhatever it is, it seems this kiss and his morning routine isn\u2019t just a kiss to him, you should talk to him to find out why it\u2019s so important for him to keep his space instead of just being hurt by his actions. If it means nothing more than \u201cI don\u2019t want to so I\u2019m not going to\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not bothered\u201d or \u201cmy routine is more important than what you want\u201d then I\u2019d look into breaking up with him, because you deserve a partner who goes out of their way to make you happier and vice versa.", "n.a.h. for having basic human needs. What you described is exactly what it was like in my marriage before I sought help for anger issues (major depression), substance abuse, and insecurity. Please know that it's not your fault for being treated this way. He's giving the best of himself to others. \n\nSo, what do you do so you don't feel like a piece of furniture? Be firm and consistent about your needs and don't give in or make excuses (in your head) for him. Work on your own personal goals/health/image. Also, how about a dog/cat? I love snuggletime with my furry friend.", "NTA but there are two reasons why I can think of for why he is the way he is.\n\n1. He feels like he is spending too much time with you or suffocated. If you are always around him when he is home, then he legitimately might feel like you are too clingy and wants some breather before work.\n2. He may also be frustrated about having to go to work, and wants to stay away so he doesn't take it out on you, and the routine helps him mellow out.\n\nHe could also be a dick, but from the sound of it, the morning thing wouldn't be the main focus if he was.", "Are you sure you are the girlfriend and not the live in maid?", "NTA but he in the other hand is an asshole all the way. It\u2019s indeed a small thing to ask and he should be able to do that for you.", "NTA - but time to go, he's over you :(", "NTA he sounds like a yikes", "Nta", "Unless you go to a dog only vet there really isn't anything you can do.\n\nMaybe try the bath  wipes?", "NTA but hes not into you. If he sees giving you affection a chore and something that is not considered part of his time then hes telling you he isnt into you and doesnt have the balls to just be honest and break up. Staying with someone who doesnt care for you will kill your self esteem so cut the cord yourself.", "NTA. I had to sit my husband down and explain that affection doesn\u2019t have to lead to sex. There are men who believe that kissing is only reserved for sex. I think he got it when he saw my extended family kissing everyone hello and good bye. It\u2019s been 25 years and he always kisses me goodbye and good night. If anything were to happen to either of us, the last thing we have to remember is that goodbye kiss. It\u2019s really just a peck.", "NTA but it's normal to want space and alone time in a relationship. His preferred time for that is in the morning. It's not a bad thing and it's a reasonable boundary. My partner is way more affectionate than me and I often have to tell him to give me space. That doesn't mean I don't want him anymore, I just want to have peace and quiet.", "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What? Does she not deserve anything out of this, whatever it is, can't call it a relationship? NTA for her, big AH vote for him.", "Agreed. Demanding physical affection, however minor, just because you want it, when the other person is clearly not in that headspace, is an asshole move.\nEdit:YTA", "Lol yeah, she's really going to leave, no job, doesn't pay rent, and is fully supported by the bf.", "And unfortunately if the person isn\u2019t willing to learn how you receive love, you can\u2019t make them so yeah NAH unfortunately", "I would normally agree but this situation doesn't sound like a live in maid one. OP is unemployed and lives rent free so taking care of the household should be logical.", "OP isn't being forced to do anything here. I certainly wouldn't call her a live in maid. Sounds like she has it pretty good considering she has a roof over her head, food in her belly, and a partner who provides it for her. I'm sure if OP wanted to get a job instead, she could.", "Wow, chill out. It does sound like op gets the affection they want, just not in the morning. Also sounds like she is living there for free / not paying her full share while looking for jobs. This pretty much sounds like a pretty good relationship. He is supporting her while she has no income and she is doing more chores in return. \n\nBut your pov is obviously, as a woman in a hetero relationship you don't have to contribute anything (money or chores) and you can demand whatever you want and if you don't get it the man is an asshole. Just out of curiosity, if a woman dates another woman, how would they pay for anything and will they just live in filth bc none of them contributes anything?", "Sounds to me like she gets things out of their relationship?\n\n\u201cI get benefits of X, Y, Z,\u201d but the only issue she pointed out was no goodbye kiss, but that suddenly turns it into \u201cHoly crap, what do you get out of this relationship?
