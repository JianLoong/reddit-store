This happened just yesterday and I\u2019m still wondering if I\u2019m TA.\n\nFor a couple weeks now my university of choice has been sending emails and reminders about an event for incoming students and their families. It\u2019s basically a glamorized tour of the campus that has information booths regarding the different departments and programs available. The event was scheduled from 8 AM till 1 PM, and one thing that everyone (especially my parents) know about me is that I HATE not being on schedule. If it\u2019s something out of my control then I don\u2019t really care, but if I have to be somewhere at a certain time then I try my best to stick to a routine that allows me to get there 15-10 minutes early. \n\nLast night me and my parents came back from visiting family and it was already around 10 PM, and I said I was gonna take a shower so I won\u2019t be rushing to get ready in the morning. I told them the plan was to wake up at 6:30 and finish getting ready by 7:30 so we could leave because it\u2019s a 20-30 min drive depending on how the traffic is. \n\nAt around 10:30 I start to settle into bed but my cat gets really whiny at night if I don\u2019t play with her for about 20 mins, so by 11 I\u2019m still awake but I\u2019m really tired and I get into bed to sleep. Here comes my dad who decides that now would be the perfect time to do a little spring cleaning around my room even though I told him we have to wake up early tomorrow. It gets to the point where I yell at him to get out of my room and let me sleep, and he does but he\u2019s still awake and moving around outside of my room. \n\nToday my alarm went off at 6:30 and I went to go wake up my parents but they just brushed me off and even got a little mad at me for trying to wake them up early. I reminded them they told me to wake them up at that time so we could get ready without a rush. I didn\u2019t want them to yell at me so I left them alone and I started getting ready myself. When I was finished I saw it was 7 already and I told them to get up if not we\u2019re gonna be late. My mom got up really fast all panicking and she started getting ready but my dad didn\u2019t get up until around 7:20. At this point I started getting irritated because this was exactly what I didn\u2019t want to happen. \n\nAt around 7:40 I\u2019m already waiting in the car but my parents aren\u2019t coming out the house yet so I call my mom and I tell her that we need to leave right now because there\u2019s a closure on the freeway and we\u2019re already late as it is. They didn\u2019t come out until 7:45 and they tried talking to me about the event and I admit my tone of voice was irritated but I don\u2019t think I was being disrespectful. My parents told me it was fine and to relax but I said \u201cit\u2019s fine for you because you\u2019re not the one going to college\u201d and I guess he thought I was talking back to him and he got mad saying I need to have more respect for him and my mom.

You had as much respect for your parents as they had for being on time for an event that's important to you.", "NTA, people commenting YTA ha e obviously never gone to college. Saying that the event is 8-1 does not mean show up anytime between then, it means show up at 8AM or don't show at all. And for a new college freshman, it's super stressful, so it's understandable that you want to know EVERYTHING about the campus. (I never cared, but that's just me). You could have been a little less snappy at your parents, but if they agreed to wake up, then I would've bugged them till they were up. If you don't want to help, don't say you will.", "NTA. I\u2019d be upset, too. \n\nMaybe to them, the entire event was 8am - 1pm, meaning you could show up any time to get a tour and view the booths?", "NTA - I don't even know what to say about some of these posts trying to slice hairs about how late you were or how your parents are doing you a favor so you need to suck it up.  \n\nThe simple fact is that this event was really important to you and you wanted to get there at a specific time.  Your parents agreed to take you and couldn't even muster up enough interest to support you in the way you hoped for during a big moment in your life.  They suck.", "Info....were you late?", "NTA man I hate it when other people make me late to an event when you\u2019ve already planned it out ahead of time. Your parents should\u2019ve been more invested in getting you to your event on time, since it was important for you and the start of your college career.", "NTA, you should have been there at 7:50 because it starts at 8. Getting there at 8:05 almost ruined it and your dad knew what he was risking for you.", "NTA This would drive me insane. I\u2019m definitely more the AH than you cuz I have full on left without people if they take too long.", "NTA, sweetheart. Late people suck.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Tell him he has it backwards. You need more respect from him. You repeatedly tried to help him not have a bad impact on you-everything from reminders to specific direction to get up now. He blew you off. He blew off your concerns. Then he told you that it was YOU who was wrong. Nothing personal, but what a loser he is.", ">I told them the plan was to wake up at 6:30\n\n>I reminded them they told me to wake them up at that time so we could get ready without a rush.\n\nNo they didn't. You told them that's when YOU were waking up.", "I get it. I like being on a schedule too. But YTA because this wasn't a strict appointment. It was an event that ran 8-1, so there was no set time you \\*needed\\* to be there so they didn't actually make you late for anything. Like I said, I get it. But being this wasn't a set time you \\*had\\* to be there, you could try being a little flexible with your folks who are doing this for you.", "You like to be early, your parents like to arrive in the nick of time. The nick of time is still not late-it's the nick of time. Late would have been 2pm. You've said you managed to cover all the ground necessary.\n\nHere's the thing-when you're a grown ass adult, you can dictate your own time frame, but relying on others means just that-you need to rely on them.\n\nYou sound very controlling, inflexible, and extremely unappreciative. You realize they're doing all of this for you, right?\n\nYTA with a capital A.", "YTA and a control freak. Also, you sure seem to be dictating a lot to your parents. You are the child living in their house and needing their assistance - you are not their boss. You're getting older, but they are still in charge of you, making them the bosses. \n\nYou repeatedly showed disrespectful and controlling behavior toward them. You should REALLY work on fixing that as you get older, because you will find it will be a major source of friction in your life.  You won't recognize that it stems from your behavior and will instead find that everyone else around you can't do anything right. \n\nThe ONLY thing they may have done wrong was where your dad was cleaning your room late at night, but one wonders why YOU weren't actually tasked with that. \n\nEither way, you're definitely the controlling AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If your dad wasn\u2019t ready, your mom & you should have gone without him.", "Ik I feel bad for snapping at my mom a bit because she was trying to get ready fast. And I would\u2019ve bugged them more to wake up but I didn\u2019t wanna be going to the thing in a sad mood because they yelled at me for bothering them while they were asleep", "Nope in one of the emails they sent there was a schedule which included check in at 8, tours from 8:30 to 10 as well as various activities and workshops for other programs and stuff that the college has for students. I really wanted to go to the tour since I\u2019ve never been on the campus and it\u2019s pretty big and I didn\u2019t wanna end up being lost the entire first week", "Kinda yeah. We had to register at a booth that was across campus and then come back to where the tours were and they were already leaving to the first stop by that point but we caught up to them", "Tbh I was debating telling my mom that if my dad didn\u2019t wake up soon to jsut leave without him because even tho we got there a bit after it started it was already so crowded and the lines for everything were really long", "It wasn\u2019t my first day I\u2019m still a senior it was just a day for admitted students to get a tour and meet faculty and see where classes are gonna take place and there were some workshops there too. I guess my parents sometimes show that plans I have aren\u2019t super important on their schedule but I decided already I would move out in my sophomore or junior year and I have savings from birthdays and stuff that could cover a deposit and first month of rent in a cheap place", "We all agreed with the plan to wake up early since they do take a while to get ready my bad for not clarifying", "Depends. College orientation is often an all day event with different things on a strict schedule that has no wiggle and the start time matters GREATLY", "It wasn\u2019t a strict appointment but they\u2019re definitely is a schedule which was my bad on not including it in the post. The tour was the most important part for me and it was super early at like 8:30. The lines for registration were really long as well but we ended up just barely catching up to the group as they were leaving", "Ok a little harsh but I get u. I don\u2019t get how me living w them has to do anything w me respecting them cuz I\u2019m supposed to live w them until I\u2019m 18 at least. \n\nAnd I am tasked w cleaning my room Lol I clean it especially the area where my cats litter box is every 2-3 days cuz the little litter grains are annoying being everywhere.", "Then 100% NTA. Is your mom understanding? I mean, she was in a panic and contributed to the lateness as well. Maybe she can talk to your dad about it with you?", "Ok. So check in STARTED at 8 and lasted 30 minutes. Did you arrive before 825?", "So, not really? I understand it is frustrating (my mom was always late), but people are not ever going to be on your schedule. Many people hate being early anywhere, waiting can be just stressful for them as the thought of being late can be for you. If you were late and missed it, I would understand stand, but this just seems like you were stressed out over starting college soon and overreacted. YTA", "It wasn\u2019t orientation it was like back to school night but for college so the students and the parents could look around campus and get more information on how it\u2019s gonna work", "That's fair. But the OP didn't clarify that until they commented to me. The description made it sound like an open 8-1 event. They clarified that the tour was set to begin at 830, so it's more understandable now.", "So barely catching up is still catching up. You seem very very inflexible.", "Okay, that's more understandable then. They way you initially described it, it sounded like an open 8-1 event. I get it now.", "Your response only reinforces my position that you're the AH. You questioning why you should show your parents respect, especially because you are living with them, demonstrates your AH tendencies.", "You say \"I get u\", then proceed to contradict that statement, and prove why you really don't get it at all.", "Don't fret about it.  Some folks just hate young people, and no matter what you did or said they would say you are an asshole.", "She was kinda understanding like she admitted she woke up later than what we agreed on but she didn\u2019t say anything to my dad", "We got there around 8:10 I think and we had to walk across the campus to register and that took about 15 ish minutes including the time it took to walk back", "Acceptable I was rlly worried about making it on time", "Lol everyone understands the concept of respecting ur parents they\u2019re ur parents I\u2019m just saying them fulfilling their legal responsibility of providing housing for me has nothing to do with my respect towards them cuz they literally signed up for that the minute they decided to keep me. \n\nAnd it\u2019s funny ur making it sound like I regularly disrespect my parents when that\u2019s the furthest thing from the truth LOL this is one incident out of the 17 years they\u2019ve raised me. I respect and admire my parents for their hard work but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t be irritated with them once in a while", "I said that as a response as to how me being irritated that we weren\u2019t on time could\u2019ve been seen as controlling", "Bleh.", "So you were pretty much perfectly on time for the actual first event", "So, for the registration time that was from 8 to 8:30, you were on time, and actually ahead of the 8:30 tour start time.  it sounds like the first tour group started early if you got back there at 8:25 and they had already left.  There would be additional tours going as they could not expect one tour guide to show everyone that showed up for tours in one group.\n\nI'm going with YTA for insisting that they be in the first group that left early instead of a tour group that left on time.\n\nDid you check to see that the first group was the ONLY tour group?  There was probably a much smaller group that left after the first group that would have potentially given you more details being in a smaller group than the first group.  And I am betting that there was a third or fourth group as well.", "I think idk because we probably have two meanings of what on time for that event means but we had to catch up to the group because they were already leaving", "There was other groups but the way it was organized was by the department u applied for. On the schedule they gave us it said 30 min tours starting at 8:30 and a seminar type thing at 9 that was scheduled next", "So the tour guide was also the AH by leaving early, and not waiting until 8:30 like the schedule said.", "If you assume that registration didn't take any time."]}
