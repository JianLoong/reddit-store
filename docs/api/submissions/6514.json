Are you sure you are over the relationship? Isn't that the actual question here? That's a marriage not a date or fancy dinner with just you two, smh.\n\nYour soon-to-be-husband is cool with it, your ex is cool with it, you are the only one trying to create drama... or deep down, you are still not over your past relationship and still try to marry someone else. In both cases big time YTA.\n\nThe only question you have to ask yourself is: Why do I feel uncomfortable inviting Ex to my wedding although everyone else is okay with it? Look past this \"not ready to see him in a romantic setting\"-BS because that is not the real reason. It's also not the reactions of the guest because guest don't care about that and most guests would consider it cool that baby dad and new husband are in an amicable relationship. (And has anyone else wondered why OP is concerned about the guests' reaction about her ex' appearance at the wedding but is cool with the fact that ex bought the engagement ring? That's cognitive dissonance right here.) There is a technique in coaching that's called the \"5 W's\". It is usually used to get to the real motive of a client's request. So ask yourself the 5 Why's and look why you *really* don't want to have him at the wedding.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to explain how the 5 W's actually work. So in this example: \"I don't want to invite my ex to my wedding because I'm not ready to see him in a romantic setting?\" -> Why? (the first why) -> \"Because XYZ\" -> Why? (2nd one) -> \"Because of this ABC\" -> Why (3rd one) ... until you reach the 5th Why and answer that.", "YTA\n\nI'm not sure I understand it all here.

I can't even fathom your new fiance being ok with it.\n\nThe father of your child attending the wedding is perfectly normal, and probably not unusual these day.  If he's a fully involved co-parent, his absence will actually suggest something is weird. \n\nFrankly, you've got it backwards.  Return the ring, or save it for your son to use.  Ask your current fiance to buy a ring for you.  Invite your ex to the wedding, tell him you'll be happy to have him there, but your attention and time will be focused on your new husband.", "YTA and an absolute train wreck", "YTA and I feel horrible for both your ex and the person you're marrying. The fact that you're calling him your \"current boyfriend\" and not your fiance but you're okay with letting your ex pay for your engagement ring to someone new, and you're not comfortable seeing your ex in a \"romantic setting\" are enormous red flags. It also sounds like you're concerned about needing to keep the peace in the co-parenting relationship with your ex, which is another, redder flag.\n\nIf you and your fiance are not in counseling, you'll need it soon, because you can be pretty damn sure he is harboring a lot of resentment that he's afraid to speak up about, because you're apparently manipulative enough to get your ex to make a huge purchase on your behalf as a gesture of romantic faith.\n\nINFO - is there a cuckolding/throuple agreement between your ex and your fiance that you didn't mention?", "YTA.

I think what's really throwing me for a loop is being comfortable with using his money/ring for such an intimate and integral part of a wedding ceremony, but not being comfortable with him being present for the part where you are using it as a symbol of your marriage to someone else. \n\n\nYou are allowed to feel like you don't want him there, but you risk coming across as someone who is willing to use your ex for his money - at best. At worst, you come across as someone who is still incredibly entrenched with their ex and doesn't feel comfortable with him being present at your wedding to someone else because it should have been ex and you can't handle addressing those feelings so you choose to remove the trigger. \n\n\nI'm not saying either of those is TRUE. But it could certainly appear that way, and this whole situation is just begging for drama and gossip. If that's your jam, go for it. If not, you should probably rethink the ring at the bare minimum.

This day is about you and your boyfriend and you and him decide who is invited, everyone not agreeing with that can suck it up. \n\nI can understand that, after a breakup, someone can feel somewhat uncomfortable seeing their ex in a romantic setting a little, but in this case: \nHe isn't just an ex. At this moment, he is primarily a close friend.You forgot to consider what not inviting him will feel like to both him (as a close friend) and your child together. \nI think that is more important than your discomfort. Also because you moved on and are marrying someone else, which should be a clear sign that you are past any romantic feelings for your ex, now close friend. \nSince somehow you think that the romantic setting at your wedding will not only be about you and your fianc\u00e9 but also about you and ex, my vote is YTA.", "YTA.

But still.\n\nI personally think that, regardless of what people say, it is perfectly possible to have a good (and with set boundaries) friendship with an ex **if** all the issues and feelings has been resolved. Usually time, communication and good intentions are keys. It isn't always possible and it isn't a shame if it doesn't apply to everyone. \n\nIf you get there, I just consider him a friend. So it would be weird not to invite him. I have broken up with my ex 3.5 years ago, we went NC for a good while. We had the same group of friends (we were friends before) so sooner or later we had to meet again. With time, both of us started having relationships, both occasionally and eventually very serious and committed. At this point, he is my friend before being my ex, that one is a closed chapter (no regrets but there isn't romantic feelings from no one). \n\nYou two seem close so I don't understand what is stopping you: usually people who have a problem with it, they directly don't stay friends with their ex. But you did and seem close, so I don't understand. For how you are, it is weird and maybe sad for him not to be invited. And from the outside, it doesn't exactly makes sense.

He\u2019s not just your ex, he\u2019s the father of your child and a part of your family since he\u2019s a \u201cvery involved\u201d father.

This wedding is a big deal to your kid, this *marriage* is a big deal to your kid. \n\nAs a kid of divorce (I know y\u2019all weren\u2019t married but you have a kid so effectively what I\u2019m gonna say is the same), I would\u2019ve been so damn over the moon with joy and happiness if my parents had been friendly enough with each other to show this sort of solidarity and support of a union. I would\u2019ve loved to see the three parental/caregiver figures in my life showing me that they care enough about the well-being of our family to be together. \n\nYou and your ex need to be a united front *at least* until your kid is an adult and it\u2019s not inappropriate to demonstrate to your kid that you are. It\u2019s fine that you don\u2019t want to invite him I guess because it\u2019s your prerogative.
