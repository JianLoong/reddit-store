Are you sure you are over the relationship? Isn't that the actual question here? That's a marriage not a date or fancy dinner with just you two, smh.\n\nYour soon-to-be-husband is cool with it, your ex is cool with it, you are the only one trying to create drama... or deep down, you are still not over your past relationship and still try to marry someone else. In both cases big time YTA.\n\nThe only question you have to ask yourself is: Why do I feel uncomfortable inviting Ex to my wedding although everyone else is okay with it? Look past this \"not ready to see him in a romantic setting\"-BS because that is not the real reason. It's also not the reactions of the guest because guest don't care about that and most guests would consider it cool that baby dad and new husband are in an amicable relationship. (And has anyone else wondered why OP is concerned about the guests' reaction about her ex' appearance at the wedding but is cool with the fact that ex bought the engagement ring? That's cognitive dissonance right here.) There is a technique in coaching that's called the \"5 W's\". It is usually used to get to the real motive of a client's request. So ask yourself the 5 Why's and look why you *really* don't want to have him at the wedding.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to explain how the 5 W's actually work. So in this example: \"I don't want to invite my ex to my wedding because I'm not ready to see him in a romantic setting?\" -> Why? (the first why) -> \"Because XYZ\" -> Why? (2nd one) -> \"Because of this ABC\" -> Why (3rd one) ... until you reach the 5th Why and answer that.", "YTA\n\nI'm not sure I understand it all here.

I can't even fathom your new fiance being ok with it.\n\nThe father of your child attending the wedding is perfectly normal, and probably not unusual these day.  If he's a fully involved co-parent, his absence will actually suggest something is weird. \n\nFrankly, you've got it backwards.  Return the ring, or save it for your son to use.  Ask your current fiance to buy a ring for you.  Invite your ex to the wedding, tell him you'll be happy to have him there, but your attention and time will be focused on your new husband.", "YTA and an absolute train wreck", "YTA and I feel horrible for both your ex and the person you're marrying. The fact that you're calling him your \"current boyfriend\" and not your fiance but you're okay with letting your ex pay for your engagement ring to someone new, and you're not comfortable seeing your ex in a \"romantic setting\" are enormous red flags. It also sounds like you're concerned about needing to keep the peace in the co-parenting relationship with your ex, which is another, redder flag.\n\nIf you and your fiance are not in counseling, you'll need it soon, because you can be pretty damn sure he is harboring a lot of resentment that he's afraid to speak up about, because you're apparently manipulative enough to get your ex to make a huge purchase on your behalf as a gesture of romantic faith.\n\nINFO - is there a cuckolding/throuple agreement between your ex and your fiance that you didn't mention?", "YTA.

I think what's really throwing me for a loop is being comfortable with using his money/ring for such an intimate and integral part of a wedding ceremony, but not being comfortable with him being present for the part where you are using it as a symbol of your marriage to someone else. \n\n\nYou are allowed to feel like you don't want him there, but you risk coming across as someone who is willing to use your ex for his money - at best. At worst, you come across as someone who is still incredibly entrenched with their ex and doesn't feel comfortable with him being present at your wedding to someone else because it should have been ex and you can't handle addressing those feelings so you choose to remove the trigger. \n\n\nI'm not saying either of those is TRUE. But it could certainly appear that way, and this whole situation is just begging for drama and gossip. If that's your jam, go for it. If not, you should probably rethink the ring at the bare minimum.

How does your fiance feel about all of this?", "But the question is what kind of guy is okay with this BS?  YTA", "Return the ring then! It\u2019s highly inappropriate that he bought your ring to your current fianc\u00e9. The least you can do is have him at your wedding.", "If you\u2019re not comfortable with him attending the wedding you need to ask yourself why, if you don\u2019t have romantic feelings for him and he supports your new relationship there is no reason he shouldn\u2019t be invited since you\u2019re such close friends", "Then return the ring", "I don't understand how you can not be ready to have your ex attend your wedding but you ARE ready to accept him buying your engagement ring (a large financial gift) for you. That is weird af.", "Nah i think you've hit it. Reminds me of that How I Met Your Mother episode where Stella doesn't want to invite her ex baby daddy to their wedding, Ted pushes it because it's totally fine, and then she leaves Ted at the altar for her ex baby daddy.", "My thoughts exactly.", "Is this an actual real indicator of being self-absorbed? I often find I use \u201cI\u201d statements.", "In that case OP is implementing the lesson Ted taught his kids as a result (never invite an ex to your wedding). There was nothing in that storyline about Stella\u2019s ex paying for the engagement ring though.", "How the hell is this sexist?", "if my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s ex \u201coffered to pay for\u201d the engagement ring as a \u201cgesture of goodwill,\u201d I\u2019d be SO uncomfortable. \n\nAnd we\u2019re both lesbians, lol, so I can confidently say this isn\u2019t about Man taking (control/care) of Woman, you know? \n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cI was in a long relationship with and have a child with Dude A, but we broke up, so Dude A paid for the ring that Dude B proposed to me with - btw we\u2019ve been together for 1/3 of the time Dude A & I were together - but like. Dude A can\u2019t be at my wedding bc my heart couldn\u2019t take it\u201d telenovela-fanfic-nonsense thing. \n\nAlso\u2026 the way OP drops these nuggets that don\u2019t quite seem nefarious out of context but when they\u2019re together it\u2019s Bad\u2026 \n* was with ex for 3y \n* have baby with said ex\n* ex is still OP\u2019s best friend \n* OP\u2019s been with new bf for 1y\n* Op\u2019s getting married to new partner! \n* Ex \u2026 paid for \u2026 the new ring?\n* But ex can\u2019t be at the wedding because OP \u201cisn\u2019t ready\u201d to see him in a romantic setting\u2026? \n\nOof.", "Oh yeah, but I'm agreeing with the above comment saying the reason she doesn't want him there is that she's not over him. Imo him paying for the ring is super weird.", "I agree she is not over him. The engagement ring thing actually feels like it belongs in The Wedding Bride movie in HIMYM. Except Tony would have written the movie so that \u2018Jed\u2019 was too cheap to pay for an engagement ring and forced Stella to get her ex to pay for it.", "Lol right"]}
