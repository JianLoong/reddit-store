Are you sure you are over the relationship? Isn't that the actual question here? That's a marriage not a date or fancy dinner with just you two, smh.\n\nYour soon-to-be-husband is cool with it, your ex is cool with it, you are the only one trying to create drama... or deep down, you are still not over your past relationship and still try to marry someone else. In both cases big time YTA.\n\nThe only question you have to ask yourself is: Why do I feel uncomfortable inviting Ex to my wedding although everyone else is okay with it? Look past this \"not ready to see him in a romantic setting\"-BS because that is not the real reason. It's also not the reactions of the guest because guest don't care about that and most guests would consider it cool that baby dad and new husband are in an amicable relationship. (And has anyone else wondered why OP is concerned about the guests' reaction about her ex' appearance at the wedding but is cool with the fact that ex bought the engagement ring? That's cognitive dissonance right here.) There is a technique in coaching that's called the \"5 W's\". It is usually used to get to the real motive of a client's request. So ask yourself the 5 Why's and look why you *really* don't want to have him at the wedding.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to explain how the 5 W's actually work. So in this example: \"I don't want to invite my ex to my wedding because I'm not ready to see him in a romantic setting?\" -> Why? (the first why) -> \"Because XYZ\" -> Why? (2nd one) -> \"Because of this ABC\" -> Why (3rd one) ... until you reach the 5th Why and answer that.", "YTA\n\nI'm not sure I understand it all here.

I can't even fathom your new fiance being ok with it.\n\nThe father of your child attending the wedding is perfectly normal, and probably not unusual these day.  If he's a fully involved co-parent, his absence will actually suggest something is weird. \n\nFrankly, you've got it backwards.  Return the ring, or save it for your son to use.  Ask your current fiance to buy a ring for you.  Invite your ex to the wedding, tell him you'll be happy to have him there, but your attention and time will be focused on your new husband.", "YTA and an absolute train wreck", "YTA and I feel horrible for both your ex and the person you're marrying. The fact that you're calling him your \"current boyfriend\" and not your fiance but you're okay with letting your ex pay for your engagement ring to someone new, and you're not comfortable seeing your ex in a \"romantic setting\" are enormous red flags. It also sounds like you're concerned about needing to keep the peace in the co-parenting relationship with your ex, which is another, redder flag.\n\nIf you and your fiance are not in counseling, you'll need it soon, because you can be pretty damn sure he is harboring a lot of resentment that he's afraid to speak up about, because you're apparently manipulative enough to get your ex to make a huge purchase on your behalf as a gesture of romantic faith.\n\nINFO - is there a cuckolding/throuple agreement between your ex and your fiance that you didn't mention?", "YTA.

I think what's really throwing me for a loop is being comfortable with using his money/ring for such an intimate and integral part of a wedding ceremony, but not being comfortable with him being present for the part where you are using it as a symbol of your marriage to someone else. \n\n\nYou are allowed to feel like you don't want him there, but you risk coming across as someone who is willing to use your ex for his money - at best. At worst, you come across as someone who is still incredibly entrenched with their ex and doesn't feel comfortable with him being present at your wedding to someone else because it should have been ex and you can't handle addressing those feelings so you choose to remove the trigger. \n\n\nI'm not saying either of those is TRUE. But it could certainly appear that way, and this whole situation is just begging for drama and gossip. If that's your jam, go for it. If not, you should probably rethink the ring at the bare minimum.

Her actions indicate that she is a receiver and not a giver and is fine taking his time and money but makes zero effort on her own. Her ex is mature enough to be an adult, that\u2019s heartwarming. OP has the attitude of a child and in an adult that is just off putting", "Thank you for your kind words. I am glad to hear that you view our situation as heartwarming and healthy. It has definitely been a journey to get to this point, but I am grateful that my ex and I have been able to maintain a positive relationship for the sake of our child. My ex has always been a supportive and involved co-parent, regularly attending school events and extracurricular activities for our child. He has also been understanding and respectful of my current relationship, and has even offered to help with wedding planning and other logistics. I am grateful for his continued support and the positive role he plays in our child's life. I also appreciate the support of my current partner, who has been understanding and accepting of our unique situation. I believe that this positive dynamic will benefit our child and help to minimize any additional stress in their life. Thank you for your understanding and support.", "Yup. She\u2019s not over him.", "Why aren't you uncomfortable with him buying your engagement ring - arguably one of the most romantic purchases a person can make.  You're comfortable taking his money to get engaged, but not comfortable inviting him to the wedding for the same engagement?", "if you don\u2019t want your ex there, you and your fianc\u00e9 need to pay him back *for your engagement ring*. it makes it sound like your ex is good enough for you for paying for your engagement ring, being a good coparent, & being a good friend, but he\u2019s not good enough to be at your wedding.\n\nYTA and tacky af for your fianc\u00e9 being ok to use your ex\u2019s money for your engagement ring but not letting him at the wedding as a \u201cgood friend.\u201d", "The only unfairness here would be marrying your fianc\u00e9 while you are still hung up on your ex. The fact you aren\u2019t ready to see your ex in a romantic setting is quite telling. And that your ex purchased your engagement ring to your fianc\u00e9 is bizarre.\n\nYou aren\u2019t obligated to invite anyone to your wedding. It isn\u2019t selfish or unfair to not invite an ex. Most people don\u2019t. If you don\u2019t want him at the wedding, don\u2019t invite him. It\u2019s unlikely any of the guests would even notice his absence. If your ex is at the wedding, guests will likely think you have a good coparenting relationship and nothing more. This is a decision strictly between you and your fianc\u00e9. Your ex\u2019s \u201cneeds and desires\u201d are (or should be) totally irrelevant when it comes to your wedding to another man.\n\nA great coparenting relationship should have boundaries, especially when it comes to each other\u2019s separate romantic lives. The lines here seem too blurry and it isn\u2019t fair to tangle someone else up in it.", "What sides though?\n\nYour ex wants to come and is supportive, your current boyfriend is fine too. There are no sides. And he\u2019s the involved father of your child, not some random dude you banged. Presumably he\u2019s going to be there with your son too. \n\nIf your ex is fine seeing a ring paid for you by your ex on your finger every day, and a little fusion of you and your ex\u2019s looks watching Peppa Pig in the living room, I think he can cope with the ex in the back of the room. You\u2019ll both be so busy you\u2019ll unlikely get to speak for him more than 10 minutes.\n\nNo, you\u2019re scapegoating the wedding for the real problem: you\u2019re so enmeshed with your ex and have rushed headfirst into another commitment with a new man before you\u2019ve truly disentangled yourself fully emotionally. You went straight from lovers to best friends, and even though you may love this new man, you never gave yourself long enough to move on. *Thats* why it feels weird seeing him in this romantic context. \n\nYou should really consider postponing the wedding and having a nice long engagement. You owe it to all 3 of the main guys in your life to truly sort out your feelings and appropriate boundaries before you sign up your kid to a new stepdad, and your new spouse to a stepkid with a woman who\u2019s not fully disentangled emotionally from the father of her child", "YTA,  You can stop struggling.  You used me, my or I at least 15 times in your short paragraph.  You are fantastically self involved, which is why you are \"struggling to determine\" if you are the asshole in this situation.

Get a grip.", "What balance? You're over him. (Allegedly) He's over you. He asked to come see you off and celebrate your special day and you're saying no. For reasons.\n\nYou keep giving non answers that aren't giving any reasons as to why.\n\nWhy is it uncomfortable to be around your \"best friend\"?\n\nWhy is it uncomfortable to have the father of your child involved in a moment of family blending?\n\nWhy are you comfortable with taking his money to help jumpstart your special and involving him in the process, but uncomfortable with him being there?\n\nWhy are you the only one uncomfortable?", "Why are you rushing this?

It seems inappropriate to outsiders because it is inappropriate. Either lean into the fact that you and your ex have an \"unconventional\" relationship or put distance between you two. You just sound greedy here.", "Sorry, kept digging for more info and now on YTA.\n\nJust to give some other perspective. I had an ex who was my friend and was my friends for many years. He was introdused as my friend and an ex way back in the day. There doesn't seem to be any reason for drama unless you bring the drama. He sounds like a good friend and a supportive ex who is the father of your child. Not many people have a good working relationship that is at a level where people would even entertain the idea of inviting an ex to their wedding. In this case though, I would find it odd if he wasn't invited.", "This additional context does *not* clarify anything. You and your ex were previously engaged, so is your current engagement ring the ring your ex proposed to you with and he just allowed you to repurpose it at an engagement ring from your new partner? Did your ex purpose with one ring and then buy a second one for you current partner to propose with when your relationship with him ended? \n\nWhatever the circumstances are, I don\u2019t think the father of your child attending your wedding is that unusual or inappropriate. And it\u2019s really nothing compared to whatever else is going on with the ring.", "Pay him back then, him going to your wedding is as inappropriate as buying your engagement ring, you can\u2019t think one is ok and the other not.", "So was the ring already purchased before you met the man you are now marrying? Was it purchased with the intention of your ex using it to propose to you, then things went south and you split up but you kept the ring and the guy you\u2019re now marrying never bought one because (if we\u2019re being real here) you already came with one? In that case you\u2019re kind of twisting words here. Your ex didn\u2019t buy you your engagement ring. Your marrying one man and wearing the ring of another.", "then you need to return the ring/money if you\u2019re not going to invite him. it\u2019s shitty to be okay with him giving you a large gift but then specifically exclude him from the event he was trying to support. you\u2019ll destroy your relationship with your ex if you do this", "If you don\u2019t want him at your wedding then you need to return the ring and any money he has given you and strictly stick to coparenting.", "If you don\u2019t invite him.

Five uses in first sentence.  This really is your movie.  Enjoy the show at \"my wedding.\"  Are you marrying yourself?", "You sound absolutely ridiculous.
