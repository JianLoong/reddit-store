That \u00a3600 is to pay for gas, electricity, food,council tax, basically everything she needs to live, now what OP needs to do is to tell the other sister to see if they\u2019re entitled to UC. Depending on their wage and childcare costs they maybe entitled to some help, they\u2019ll pay up to 85% of childcare costs. But please don\u2019t think because the first sister gets the \u201cfree\u201d money that she\u2019s rolling in it, the COL has skyrocketed especially gas and electricity."]}
