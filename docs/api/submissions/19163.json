Probably because, rightly so, he doesn\u2019t see it as a \u201cjob\u201d but more as just a part of being in a family.

This is not wanting to concede any control.", "If the kids are with you, then that's also not a neutral party..", "Wait, what conflict of interest? This isn't politics. It is co-parenting. \n\nIt sounds like you dint want your son to have extra time w family members that aren't you.", "It\u2019s baby sitting not renegotiating The Hague convention.

Can you actually verbalize it? That's a pretty vague assertion.", "YTA. Lol, your jealousy and resentment is showing. You\u2019re being absolutely ridiculous.", "It's actually the opposite. He wants to stay in good standing with your ex so he's going to treat your kids great. You want them treated well, and so does he. That's a matching of interests, not a conflict.\n\nNow if the conflict of interest is about you not wanting your kids to like your ex and Chris, you have some serious soul searching to do.", "What is the \u201cconflict of interest\u201d? This isn\u2019t a business deal. It\u2019s coparenting.

All he\u2019s doing is keeping the kids safe when you or your ex aren\u2019t with them.\n\nHe also is, like it or not, in some ways a bonus parent to your kids now.

He\u2019d just\u2026live with them longer\u2026and parent them\u2026which mostly consists of feeding them and breaking up fights at that age.

If a parent made significantly less or didn\u2019t work and now had to find a 2+ bedroom apartment or home it can be extremely difficult to get more custody as well. And at the end of the day there may be something to letting kids keep the normalcy of their home staying the same if that\u2019s a workable option.\n\nJust don\u2019t want us to assume any parent without full custody must have done something wrong.", "I don't think that's necessarily fair. In any case, I think it weakens his argument since he's only talking about less than a week per month.", "I agree. I want to know why she has such little custody time, because depending on the reason that could make a huge difference. The fact that the Stepdad has been around a minimum of 5 years and is not on the school pick up list is also a red flag for me.", "I'm actually getting major abuser vibes from OP- maybe not physical but definitely emotional. Everything he's written reeks of a need for power and control. In my experience, guys like that can be pretty convincing to judges. But once the kids are old enough to have a say in court, look out, because another messy custody battle will be coming. I work with higschoolers and I see them go through this all the time, the toll on them is really rough. I hope I'm wrong though.", "It's often that the parent who was the primary care taker before the divorce gets more custody - i.e., the one who was around more/worked less. It doesn't necessarily mean there's something sinister going on.", "This actually sounds like a standard possession order, it\u2019s generally 1st 3rd and 5th weekend and one day a week to the noncustodial parent.

I wasn\u2019t being entertained by my parents at 7, they were busy after school either finishing off their work, cooking dinner or a multitude of other things. I just played with my toys or watched tv. It\u2019s not that hard, it\u2019s a part of parenting. Kids don\u2019t (generally) need your undivided attention 100% of the time. They need to learn to entertain themselves.", "What if they need rides to activities or friend's houses? Are they not allowed that because StepDad is working?", "I worked from home and watched my child, from 2 months on. This is entirely feasible and no, a 7 year old doesn\u2019t need 24/7 attention. Care? Yes.", "What, have you ever actually been around a 7 year old? You know they are in school by that time.

Pay for the sitter yourself.", "Just because it's a two yes situation doesn't mean he isn't an asshole for refusing the offer and also refusing to financially support his decision.", "That\u2019s because it is.

Thank god my ex and current husband never made me deal with this. Prime example of not behaving in a way that is best for the kids.", "... geez, that sounds hard... adding him to the pickup list... deal killer there I guess... must be near impossible.", "Yeah, one of his comments was that Chris had a ton of problems with his son, but that OP's 13yo is worse than him? Kinda seems like Chris might parent better than OP and hes jealous. \n\n\nAlso he made a weird comment about how Chris sent his son to a sleepaway camp when he was 13, like it was a bad thing which gives off controlling vibes imo. Like he cant handle the kid being gone in a situation where he didnt have control.", "Did you miss the part where OP said he would rather WFH and watch his own kids instead of Chris doing it? \n\nSame scenario. \n\nWhat makes it different?", "Ah yes, I forgot that part in OPs post about that happening. /s", "In my experience, that's not what a baby sitter does, that's a nanny.  \n\nVast majority of Baby sitters I've seen make sure you do your homework, eat dinner, put on a movie, and don't harm yourself lol.", "My babysitter never drove us around either\u2026she didn\u2019t have a license anyway, nor enough room for all of us when she did. Parents can plan the kid\u2019s activities for outside work hours and kids can wait to visit friends, they\u2019ll be fine, they can at least FaceTime until then if they\u2019re that desperate.", "Most daycares don't do that anyway. You get there and stay there until parents pick you up.", "Work from home doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t drive to activities. My husband takes our kids to plenty of after school appointments or activities or even mid day ones. He just takes his laptop with him and works from wherever he is. He also has headphones so he can take phone calls or attend meetings. We have no idea how flexible this guys schedule is. He may be willing to take time out in the middle of the day and catch up in the evening when mom gets home from work. He may not actually need to put in a full 40 hours per week as long as he gets his work done. He may be self employed. He might start his day at 6 and work straight through without a lunch break so he can be done by the time the kids are off school.", "How many kids do you know who get any of that done by babysitters?   When I was a kid, both of my parents worked - not at home - and they were still the ones taking us to friends and activities and stuff. \n\nNow that I\u2019m a stay-at-home grownup with kids that young, here is how it works with literally every family I know:\n\nFriends are for weekends.   This facilitates parental work schedules.   \n\nActivities work alone a school bus schedule, or else there are car pools. \n\nAnd that\u2019s it.   The more flexible schedules come when kids are teens, and more able to move themselves around without close supervision.\n\nThese kids would probably have more opportunity for friends and activities with stepdad, not fewer.  Babysitters charge per child, so there are absolutely no extra kids over when they\u2019re on shift.", "If they are at home they gotta be watched.  I have raised them and now a grandmother.  Kids at school behave one way and completely different at home.", "I think you have to be old (like pre- internet old) to have used ftr regularly.", "Because as per OP, if I couldn't handle \"babysitting\" my kids full time, then the stepdad surely can't.\n\nOP have you considered that the stepdad maybe has a higher tolerance than you. If you love your kids enough and show it enough you don't have anything to fear from the stepdad taking over babysitting.", "Because sabotage. \n\nBringing up children inevitably has bumps in the road. You can just bet that every single time stepdad is the one in charge of the kids however, that OP is going to pretend that it\u2019s all the fault of the stepparent.", "Honestly\u2026 I\u2019m with you. Obviously there\u2019s so so much that we don\u2019t know about this whole family, but I noticed that OP didn\u2019t shit talk his ex at all, but who\u2019s to say Chris won\u2019t? The kids are gonna be there more often, what if they overhear ex and stepdad talking badly about OP? \n\nAnd even the things he said about Chris are very\u2026 reserved. He could\u2019ve gone off and said whatever he wanted about Chris being a bad stepdad/sitter, but instead he presented a couple legitimate concerns. I would definitely consider level of patience as an important factor when choosing a childcare worker.", "Yeah, might involve sending an email or maybe even signing a form. Soook hard."]}
