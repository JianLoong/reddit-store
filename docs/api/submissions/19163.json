They have the chance to be cared for by someone who is actually family, and who seems to actually want the job, so much so that he would do it for free. Probably because, rightly so, he doesn\u2019t see it as a \u201cjob\u201d but more as just a part of being in a family. The only reasons you can come up for him not to do it seem to be because it would give the boys some sort of allegiance to him that you don\u2019t think he or your ex deserve.

Whilst free childcare and bonding with stepfather would be good, being tied to meetings on a laptop for 8hrs/day doesn't equal suitable supervision to fulfill a babysitting requirement.", "Wife only has limited custody from other comments (only 8 days a month!)- if he lets Chris babysit regularly on \u201chis\u201d time, it alters that and she can go to court to demand more custody time/pay less child support. Based on that his legal interest he should absolutely deny them this.", "She probably isn\u2019t.", "What are you talking about? The boyfriend literally lives with the kids so he's already trusted with them. If he had concern that they were in any kind of danger from him he'd be acting on that/calling the police already, before a babysitting idea even came up.", "He wasn't looking to get paid, he was just offering to adapt his job to be work from home so he could be available, he already has a job. Also, given that the current babysitter is staying through end of summer and most work days run a similar timeline to most school days, the kids would be at school while he's doing his work. It would leave him available for drop off/pick up, sick days, doctors appointments, snow days, etc.", "Omg this. This guy is SUCH a whiny AH", "You DO understand that the age of 13 becomes before the age of 18? He's been there.", "Fuck the Raiders r/denverbroncos", "9 and 7 yo don't need attention 24/7", "Except the kids are more than old enough to not need a full on babysitting requirement(barring mental or physical disabilities). And again, if step-dad working from home equals unsuitable, than dad working from home should also equal unsuitable supervision.", "You'd have one sitter, and one stepparent.", "Why should she help pay for childcare when YOU won't allow the care she picked, and she only has them around 8-10  days a month?", "No but he does need to be able to set aside differences to prioritize the children, which he clearly is not doing.", "Given that the current babysitter is staying on through the end of summer, it's safe to assume that the kids would be going back to school by the time this becomes a concern. The average work day has a similar time frame as the average school day, so Chris could have his work done before the kids are even out of classes. The thing that work from home really offers is that the kids will regularly have a parental figure dropping them off/ picking them up from school, being home with them on sick days, snow days, available for emergencies, stuff that you may not get when when your parents have to work. With OP having majority custody, he would be coming to get them after his work day ends so realistically, Chris is really just offering to be on call and handle a couple hours after school until OP gets off work.\n\nHonesty, unless there is something seriously wrong with Chris, OP is just screwing over the kids *and* himself. 1) He saves a bunch of money on childcare *which is fucking bonkers, seriously, might as well be a stay at home parent unless you're making good money*. 2) Instead of trying to force a bond with an entirely new person, the kids get to build up one they already have in their family life. Providing stability and a strong support system is something that is necessary in blended families, and every opportunity to provide that should be taken if the adults are putting the children first before their own egos/hatred/jealousy.", "At 7 they can entertain themselves. If the WFH is the type that can be interrupted any time, then it potentially doable. They need someone to get them drinks and meals. Some snacks they can do themselves. The 9 year old might be able to get the 7 yo drinks. My granddaughter has been making her own sandwiches for a year. Sometimes that\u2019s what she decides for lunch or supper. I keep a few drink boxes as a treat instead of making her have only juice every time she\u2019s thirsty. So a work from home is doable if they can still pay attention to what\u2019s going in around them. The biggest thing with 7 and 9 year olds is keeping them out of stuff they shouldn\u2019t be in and making sure they eat properly not just all junk food.", "They seem to want OP to pay them for the baby sitting. Frankly I would feel the same about paying an ex's new partner to look after my kids. For free, yes, but stuffed if I'm going to pay them.", "The OP doesn't want to be taking care of them when he's WFH. The stepdad does.", "And OP said stepdad misses being a more hands on dad so his job may allow him to give them some attention they need", ">Stepdad will be working so his attention will be split (though that argument holds little water when the OP's solution is he works from home).\n\nI'm not sure why - the actual father is invested in his kids, this guy is someone his ex chose. I'm not sure why all dads are being treated as equal, when one is probably far more prepared to stretch his WFH stuff because it's his own children.", "Yeah I honestly don't get how he feels that he has the right to say that his ex's spouse isn't allowed to walk the kids during her kid time, like the only valid reason I could see an ex having a say in this was if the person watching the kids was genuinely unfit, unsafe, not old enough to watch them. But that isn't the case here, so he really has no place to say the step dad can't watch the kids during Mom's custody time", "If the roles were reversed, the ex would have to accept whoever OP chose as a partner will be doing the babysitting or the ex wouldn't be prioritizing the children?", "I bet OP knows about this camp because his kids were probably complaining they didn't get to do the same thing while Mom was overseas.", "Pro tip: never hire a babysitter based on their experience with serial killers.", "Sorry, I know this is off topic, but I bathe my 7 year old? Doesn\u2019t anyone else? \ud83d\ude33", "Also like obviously don't make the other kid into a parent, but saying to the 13 year old, \"Hey can you play video games in the same room as them for an hour and make sure they don't kill each other?\" isn't a big deal now and then.", "Did OP say that in a comment? Because in the post he\u2019s talking about how because he turned them down, his ex is insisting he bay for the babysitter himself. This implies that before they were splitting daily childcare costs, which is a fairly normal stipulation in custody agreements.", "Jesus turn off dateline. \n\nWe are plenty safe for kids to be independent. You sound like a helicopter parent", "Not really- I grew up in a rough part of nyc and by 7 my bro and I were latchkey kids and on our own while my parents worked. It was awesome. \n\nI don\u2019t know where this helicopter parenting came from but it\u2019s not doing anyone any favors.", ">It's because most places in America are not safe. \n\nThis is B.S.", "What is bathing for you? I just googled it to verify for myself, but in my country children use the sponge at 3-4 years, and are fully idependent at age 7-8. \n\nIf your child is talkative and wants you around to talk; i see no problem.", "Yeah, this. OP hasn't expressed any concerns about the WFH thing. His entire deal is that he's horribly jealous of his ex-wife's new husband- I mean, that he thinks a grown man who's already raised one son to adulthood won't be able to deal with three kids who already live with him some of the time.", "It's entirely likely that the 13 year old is not even present. Not only do middle school students have lots of options for sports and extra curriculars that could keep the older kid at school way later than the younger ones, they might be on different school schedules where the elementary school gets out before the middle school.", "We don\u2019t know the maturity level of the 13 y/o. For all we know he could be physically abusive like my older brother was. He was the second oldest of 5 and he was constantly smacking us for no reason or just being plane mean.", "I don't think they mean it would change the court specified custody time, just that the ex would be getting to spend bonus time with the kids if step dad is watching them during dad's time and having her time as well.", "No it\u2019s not like that in every day life. We aren\u2019t all so paranoid here. The comment you replied to feels so helicoptery. Some independence is good for kids.", "It is exhausting. I hear gunshots every night. In my 5yrs in this neighborhood we've had 2 drunk drivers flip their cars upsidedown on our street. People cut off car parts in the middle of the night. You'd think being next to a school ppl would slow down for the \"school zone\" but they fly our narrow street like it's the interstate.", "Do not listen to this person. It is not like that at all.", "Holy wild assumptions batman.", "I didn\u2019t start using it until the Internet. I am AOL chat room old.  and it goes back to pretty much that era.", "Well I am 41, so yeah lol", "The actual dad is not a babysitter either. Babysitting your own children is called parenting.", "Says who though? If school is 9-3, you could easily go to an extra-curricular from 3-5 and then come home and do a couple extra hours.", "And the kids getting to see their mom a few hours more a week is a bad thing to OP??? Like does he NOT want them to see or have a good relationship with their mother? She literally only gets them for 4 days out of every two weeks according to OP", "I gathered they needed a sitter for the moment they could not parent or needed a break from parenting.", "Bruh same!", "OPs post implies otherwise since he stated he would adjust his work schedule and WFH to \"babysit\", so it sounds like they need childcare during work hours, likely before and after school.", "Thanks for responding \ud83d\ude0a", "Where do you live? Yes I've seen Lovely Bones, but didn't think of it more than a sad fictional story. \n\nIt is very different here, kids can move quite freely everywere", "That is a moment they could not parent\u2026 so I think we gathered the same information."]}
