It's all on you, my man.\n\nAnd FTR: the step dad made a very generous offer.  Might want to process that offer a little bit more.", "YTA. Dude is willing to try and make things work and you just shoot him down. You havent even given him the chance. Seeing he managed to raise an 18y.o can tell me that he is capable of managing a 13y.o\n\nYou're scared the stepdad will brainwash your kid and turn him against you.", "Swear I remember this being posted before \ud83d\ude12", "YTA. I'm kind of surprised they even asked, since it's her husband of a few years. If he works from home, he'd watch the boys during mom's days, and that's kind of that. You can figure out your own arrangements for them when they're on your days with you?", "YTA I would be checking the custody agreement if I were your ex. In my agreement I\u2019m only responsible for child care on my custody days and I\u2019m allowed to decide what that child care is. My ex had his mom babysit for free on his days while I was paying for aftercare on my time. Now that I\u2019m remarried I definitely have my husband help when needed.", "YTA\n\nThis man is their stepdad. You may not like him personally, but it sounds like there's no particular reason you wouldn't trust him with the kids. And since you're sharing custody, he's already a part of their family and their lives. I get wishing you could keep him at arm's length. but that ship sailed when he married your ex. And as long as he's a decent person, your kids are not going to suffer for having another adult who loves and cares about them in their lives.\n\nIf you insist on being this rigid, they yeah, you should foot the bill. But it would be in everyone's best interest to let this blended family actually blend.", "YTA - you should 100% pay for sitter costs on your time. They can figure out a sitter on their time. Even if that means stepdad WFH to watch them.\n\nYou haven\u2019t given any examples of them being a bad person or overstepping boundaries.", "YTA.\n\nYour ex wife doesn't need to pay your babysitting costs because you have some very lightweight concerns over them spending time at their other home with adult supervision.\n\nSeriously, if it was just your 13 yo, you wouldn't even need a sitter at all. I'm glad you're not expecting him to look after the younger boys. but it's not nice for you to refuse to allow them to spend time in their own home, where they are most comfortable, with one of their own parental figures. This is nuts.\n\nYou don't have a leg to stand on here. You literally let them live with this man. he is helping to raise them. He is completely safe. He also clearly likes your kids and cares about them, or he wouldn't want them in the house as his responsibility while he's working. You have good kids. They have a good stepfather. This is a win win.", "Their stepfather should be able to bond with them like their sitter did. Are you sure you\u2019re not just jealous?\n\nIf you\u2019re actually able to change your work schedule and wfh full time, great, do that! If not, the YTA, you should be paying 100% of the babysitting costs.", "YTA you don\u2019t want to use the free sitter because your jealous and not over your ex so you get to pay for a sitter.", "YTA for sure. You have no valid reason for turning down the free option, so if a sitter is required you should be the one to pay 100% for it. It's not their fault you have some issue with him babysitting. If you're actually that worried about him not having the patience, make it a trial run and see how he handles it.", "INFO: is there some evidence of maltreatment  you opted to leave out? It sounds like he\u2019s spent plenty of time with your boys in his care over the years, even with limited visits. And kids do fine with multiple sitters; it\u2019s pretty common.", "Oh, I hope you end up paying 100% of the costs. Because it would be a literal price to pay for your jealousy. \n\nYTA", "YTA. If the free sitter/stepdad isn\u2019t good enough for you, then YOU get to pay for someone you deem appropriate. \n\nAlso you just generally sound like a jerk.", "YTA and you should also be the one paying it. Chris is also a father and lives with the three boys I\u2019m sure in the years they have bonded and he has gotten to know their personalities", "YTA. Their stepfather, who they know well, has offered to take care of them full time. If you don't want him to do that during your custody time, you are free to make and pay for other arrangements. But their mother is absolutely reasonable to have her husband provide childcare during her custody time.", "Yta", "Chris has been living with your kids for a few years so I\u2019m guessing he has done some \u201cbabysitting\u201d & he will continue to be living with your kids. Would Chris be going to your house? \n\nI\u2019m confused what the issue is though.... Why would you need a sitter? You offered to solve the problem & WFH, so end of conversation.... I think.\n\nIn terms of who pays... you both need to agree on a sitter. Because Chris is free doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s the best choice. \n\nNAH or ESH\n\neta \u2014 the biggest question is what do your kids think? Do they like Chris? Do they respect him? I can see a potential \u201cpower\u201d struggle with the adults but y\u2019all need to work it out like adults.", "NTA from the info we have. If you are not comfortable with the setup it shouldn't happen. The best is to find another Chris if possible or as you said, you will do it.", "NTA. He isn't going to really be watching the kids. He'll just be working and keeping an ear out for them. If your ex is required to split the cost of child care she needs to keep on paying because her current husband isn't an option.", "NTA- he\u2019s not a professional, he is their moms support person, and if y\u2019all can\u2019t find a sitter you will WFH \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA nope nope nope, if your not comfortable with it then you and your ex have to decide.
