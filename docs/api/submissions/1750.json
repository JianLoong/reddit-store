First off, since school isnt enough for her to do, why arent you telling us about your own job? Because from the sound of it, youre a SAHM but without the kids, so just a SAHW? Also, it easily sounds like she worked at a toxic workplace, which is especially common at chains where uniforms need to be bought. What do you mean with \"taken the time from my children and used that time for herself\" so shes being social with you guys? And outcompeting a 2 and a 3 year old for attention?

She can't steal time from 'YOUR children from their dad' because she is his daughter.\n\nEdit:   wow, just seen your comments and would like to add that your SD is absolutely right and you are clearly very jeaolous and very bitter and resentful towards her because she 'dares' to want to spend time and talk to her dad. \n\nJust because your children are small, doesn't mean they deserve more time and attention that your SD. \n\nYou're supposedly an adult, act that way. She is a child that also needs her dad.", "YTA\n\nYou most certainly do not treat her as one of your own; if you did, then you wouldn\u2019t have said that to her.\n\nYou also told her she was living in your house; it\u2019s her dads house therefore should be her home too.\n\nYou do sound jealous that she\u2019s there interacting with her father in the evenings.\n\nYou also don\u2019t sound like you are buying her extravagant things,  you sound like you\u2019re providing just the basics.\n\nEverything you\u2019re complaining about is a typical teenager, your children will be the same way.", "Hard YTA here. Telling her that she's lucky you treat her as your own daughter is pretty much the nuclear option and is guaranteed to ruin your relationship with her going forward. This gets worse the longer you have been with your current husband and the longer she's been a part of your family, which should have been at least four years based on your kids ages.\n\nNow, your stepdaughter might also be an asshole, have a poor work ethic, not be helping out enough around the house, or otherwise be a burden, but as described you've gone about this in a terrible way (and given us zero indication of what actually happened re: custody or what your husband's role is in all this).

You don't \"treat her as your own,\" you've made it obvious you see her as an interloper and resent her for taking time from your children with your husband. You need to remember he was her dad first, you're the interloper.", "YTA\n\nYou would be TA only for saying \"you're lucky I treat you as my own\".

But that could just be my \"poor brain\" talking.\n\nHowever, I maintain that the way you see your husband's time and effort as a finite resort only you and your children are entitled to is a huge asshole move. She's his child too. 18 means very little, people don't miraculously become fully capable, mature, fully functioning adults just because they turn 18, especially if their sittuation growing up is fraught.\n\nEdit: typo.", "Who can say? Maybe you're lucky because your husband hasn't asked for a divorce from your trifling self yet.", "YTA. It doesn't sound like you have done anything extraordinary for her. You've bought her clothes, foos, put a roof over her head. Most parents would do all that, big deal. So she's disrupting your routines, too bad. She has a right to speak with her dad and hang out with him as much as her siblings do. \n\nAs for her asking for things,  you all can say no. And if necessary,  Dad can set aside time for her after his younger children have gone to bed.", "If by school you mean shes at college/ university, all full time degrees make up a full work week. Students jeapordise good grades by working a job along side studying, if your family is finanically stable enough to support step daughter through this thats an infinitely more sensible option so as not to risk good grades for this stupid bootstrap work to the bone or you're lazy mentality you seem to be perpetuating here. SD is correct you do sound like most of your issue is jealous you're having to share husbands time attention and finances. Not even gonna get started on the consider yourself lucky comment coz im sure everyone here will tear u a new one enough for that. Just remember, consider yourself lucky you're not destitute or dying of a terminal disease, i hope you find that comforting like your SD :)", "YTA. The mere fact that you told her she's lucky that you treat her as your own shows that you draw a deep divide between her and \"your own.\" \n\nBy all means, stop spending your savings on this girl, but you need to get over the fact that this has upset the strict routine you had in place before she moved in.  Your own kids will grow and other things will happen to upset that routine time and again.  That's just life--and part of the \"adulting\" is learning to deal with it.", "There's one important thing missing here. Your husband's POV.", "YTA. You need serious therapy because she\u2019s right, you ARE jealous that she has a relationship with her father. Like that\u2019s super ick and weird as hell.

Not that I can say for sure, because you clearly aren't a reliable narrator. Your comments about her, and the fact you flat out told her that she's lucky you treat her like one of your kids, makes it clear you are the asshole in this situation.\n\nAlso, you talking about what a burden she is, and your comments about her being 18 and needing to figure out a living plan are concerning. Are you one of those people who believes that a child should be kicked out on their 18th birthday because they're an adult and therefor no longer your problem? Because not only is that what it seems like, but I also feel some \"stepmonster\" vibes here. I'm confident you wouldn't speak about your own children the way you do about your stepdaughter. \n\nWanting her to work part-time while she is in school (don't pretend online classes don't count) to help cover personal costs is perfectly reasonable. But that really does not seem to be what you're getting at.", "YTA, you clearly don't treat her as your own or you wouldn't be upset that her presence infringes on your precious time with her father, who by the way, will always be her father. He may not always be your husband though.", "Your husband and his ex should work together and make a plan for this girl.  She sounds like a lot of teens, but she shouldn't be abandoned to live in a tent.", "You are not necessarily TA for not wanting to keep paying for things for her, or for being upset that she monopolizes your husband's time, but I have to say YTA for what you said to her.  Treating her as your own is what any good step parent should do, and it was cruel of you to throw it in her face like that.  A lot of the problems you describe are fairly normal issues with teenagers, especially with one who has been kicked out of the house by her birth mother.  It is also unfair to say she is being lazy all day long using her computer if she is actually going to school online.  Unless you are monitoring every website she goes to, you don't know how much of her computer use is dedicated to her education.", "YTA. She\u2019s just a kid. You\u2019re coming off as very judgmental and harsh, and the \u2018favors\u2019 you\u2019re doing aren\u2019t from the kindness of your heart.

Shame on you", "YTA. Sounds like you were expecting more of a roommate than a daughter. I get that she's 18 and she sounds like she's trying (online school) but the way you're describing it makes you sound like you've  resented her from the beginning.", "YTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t treating her as your own unless you think your actual children are a burden when they want to spend time with their father.\n\nPlus, you did it without your husband\u2019s consent. Why do you think you can kick her out without so much as a conversation with her actual parent?", "YTA. She is only 18. The only specific wrong that you list is that you bought her work uniform and she quit after 3 months.", "YTA. She's not lucky that you're treating her like your own child.

It\u2019s clear you never meant to accept his other child as part of the family with your blatant attempts to alienate her. He SHOULD be spending time with all 3 of his children, not just your two. She SHOULD be included in all the family aspects. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate your husband married you and had two kids with you. Too bad he didn\u2019t realize how terrible you\u2019d be to his daughter beforehand. Good luck with your divorce.", "Wouldn't have been TA if you hadn't thrown her being your stepchild into the discussion. Either you love her like your own or you don't. Would you tell your own children that they're lucky you support them?

However, her income isn\u2019t such that she can spend money on whatever she wants. Further, since she\u2019s an adult, it is reasonable to expect her to work at least part time and cover some of her own expenses, if for no other reason than she needs to be in the habit of doing it. \n\nYou suck because the first paragraph is the conversation you should\u2019ve had first with your husband, then with your stepdaughter, and instead you went the \u201cI don\u2019t have to be nice to you,\u201d route. Which is bullshit on many levels. First, you say you love her like your own, then throw in her face that she isn\u2019t when you\u2019re annoyed. You\u2019re the whole ass adult here, not just a legal one. Why are you stooping to playground insults (you\u2019re adopted!) rather than actual parenting? If you see her as your own, parent her.

She's in full time education so she's pretty far from lazy.\n\nI get the feeling when you got together with your husband you had this idea in your head that because his child was older he could be 100% focused on yours and you wouldn't really be a stepparent she'd just be a distant older sister away from your nuclear family.
