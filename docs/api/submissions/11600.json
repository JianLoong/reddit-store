You're setting yourself on fire to keep others warm and have communicated your limits; now you need to stick to them. Go or they'll know they can saddle you with anything and you'll take it. NTA", "Nta you have the patience of a Saint.  This is hard but take care of yourself, first", "NTA.  Your mom sounds toxic.  Run.", "NTA You\u2019re 19, it\u2019s a normal age to move out and get your own place. Have you considered that?", "NTA That would be a wise move.", "NTA Your need to move out for your own wellbeing. You are not the parent.", "NTA\nYou were thrust into a parental role where your mom should have developed supports through other adults. You do not have the maturity, skills nor power to fill the role of parent and partner for her, to replace a father in the home. Divorce is a painful and confusing process for the whole family. It's natural to flounder about a bit, trying to live through your day to day while the family structure is in upheaval. I don't fault your mom for initially looking to the eldest child to help ride herd on the rest during that state. I DO fault your mom for settling into leaning so heavily on a single traumatized child to take over parental responsibility, without the resources and autonomy adults have. It could have been a band aid. It shouldn't be a lifestyle.\n\nAny time you feel responsible for supervising, managing and nurturing your siblings, think a moment if it's your parents job to do that for their kids. Is this familiar because you were indoctrinated to believe \n\nIf you don't do it, it won't get done and that hurts a sibling (fear).\n\nIt's your familial duty to step up in these trying times (obligation).\n\nThis is your job. There's no one else to do it. If you walk away from it, you're abandoning your responsibility and hurting your family (guilt).\n\nFOG, the long distance tools of emotional manipulation and abuse. When you feel pulled to do something you also very much don't want to do, that's likely a place you need a boundary to protect your safety, privacy, autonomy and/or comfort. You've probably been taught to ignore your gut responses, \"don't be selfish\" by prioritizing (or even recognizing) your needs, be the bigger person, there's no one else to do it....\n\nPlease learn about healthy boundaries. They can build relationships where your needs are supported and respected. It's revolutionary.", "NTA, But for the puppies sake please rehome it first. It deserves a chance at a good home. And take the old dog"]}
