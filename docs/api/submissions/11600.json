You're setting yourself on fire to keep others warm and have communicated your limits; now you need to stick to them. Go or they'll know they can saddle you with anything and you'll take it. NTA", "Nta you have the patience of a Saint.  This is hard but take care of yourself, first", "NTA.  Your mom sounds toxic.

You are not the parent.", "NTA\nYou were thrust into a parental role where your mom should have developed supports through other adults. You do not have the maturity, skills nor power to fill the role of parent and partner for her, to replace a father in the home. Divorce is a painful and confusing process for the whole family. It's natural to flounder about a bit, trying to live through your day to day while the family structure is in upheaval. I don't fault your mom for initially looking to the eldest child to help ride herd on the rest during that state. I DO fault your mom for settling into leaning so heavily on a single traumatized child to take over parental responsibility, without the resources and autonomy adults have. It could have been a band aid. It shouldn't be a lifestyle.\n\nAny time you feel responsible for supervising, managing and nurturing your siblings, think a moment if it's your parents job to do that for their kids. Is this familiar because you were indoctrinated to believe \n\nIf you don't do it, it won't get done and that hurts a sibling (fear).\n\nIt's your familial duty to step up in these trying times (obligation).\n\nThis is your job. There's no one else to do it. If you walk away from it, you're abandoning your responsibility and hurting your family (guilt).\n\nFOG, the long distance tools of emotional manipulation and abuse. When you feel pulled to do something you also very much don't want to do, that's likely a place you need a boundary to protect your safety, privacy, autonomy and/or comfort. You've probably been taught to ignore your gut responses, \"don't be selfish\" by prioritizing (or even recognizing) your needs, be the bigger person, there's no one else to do it....\n\nPlease learn about healthy boundaries. They can build relationships where your needs are supported and respected. It's revolutionary.", "NTA, But for the puppies sake please rehome it first. It deserves a chance at a good home.

So when she is here she is still completely emotionally absent from everybody and locks herself up in her room so nobody bothers her", "thank you for this. i\u2019m chronically ill so working full time already strains me, i need to move out and finally get some rest and a break", "my mom works a job that makes very very little money (less than i do) and also works less than i do. dad sends child support, mom spends most of that on rent and whatnot and then blows it on stupid things like alcohol and eyelash extensions. if she actually managed money right we would be better off but she just blows through it for men and drinks, while i work to get groceries and pay bills", "my dad is really upset and worried for me, he checks in with me all the time trying his best to support me. he\u2019s torn on what to do because the other two teenagers don\u2019t want to live with him but he can\u2019t stand seeing the neglect", "I feel for you OP.\n\nI made the same choice when my parents split, though the impact was less severe and it worked out okay in the end.\nI think it's fair to let your teenaged siblings experience the effects of their choices, when you're not there to maintain the house, feed the four of them and clean up after the puppy. If they step up, great!\nIf they don't, is there any way to keep in touch with the younger 2, so they're not neglected?\n\nETA: not that potential neglect is on you, nor its prevention!\nI'm just trying to think of your peace of mind: you'll probably have an easier time taking care of yourself if you know there's a plan. When you've had such responsibilities pushed on you, you don't usually manage to put them down in one day, you know? Especially since you're at the point of panic and tears all night!\nHugs if you want them", "Would your dad allow the other children to live with him as well?", "this is the exact situation. he\u2019s paying all child support, but she just uses it for herself. he wants really badly to take us all in but the other two teenagers don\u2019t want a parent that\u2019s actually present so they refuse to. i\u2019ve just stayed out of guilt and fear of what will happen if the one present person they live with leaves", "This is not an appropriate answer from an adult and parent and I hope you understand that. You need to take a step back and wonder why *both* your parents are putting this responsibility on you.", "My dad doesn\u2019t have a relationship with any of his children. There\u2019s no hatred, we just don\u2019t bother with each other.", "yeah NTA. \n\nTake your older dog to your dads and drop the puppy off at a shelter.", "NTA \n\nYou need to look out for yourself as well and the fact that your family thought it was appropriate to give you something else to take care of should tell you that you need a little distance from them.\n\ni n fo - I don't know where you live but why is your mom suddenly poor if you were upper middle class before? Is your father not required to pay alimony or child support?", "OP don't wait even another minute. Get out of there now! You don't owe your egg donor anything.", "NTA. Move out. Let your parents handle raising your siblings. That's their job not yours.", "NTA. Get out of that house ASAP.", "NTA- start packing girl!!", "NTA", "NTA. Gi be free honey.", "NTA. It\u2019s going to be ok. Find someplace else to live, and link it to being overwhelmed and nothing changing. Give them at least a weeks notice. Don\u2019t argue about it. Just go.", "NTA. Move out. Your mom and family are abusing you. You\u2019re 19. Working over 40hrs is a lot. You\u2019re literally being parentified. You need a break. The divorce happened to you too. Go be free", "NTA and it's time to GTFO.  You've got your own life to start building and you're not going to do that while you're trapped doing everything your mother is supposed to be doing as a parent.", "You would not be the AH.  Your decision is based on adult -sound - reasoning.  Go for it.", "NTA Run, don't walk", "Don\u2019t spend even another night at you mom\u2019s house. You deserve to move on with your life. If you don\u2019t, your mom will just add and add to your burdens.", "NTA move out you shouldn't be taking on the financial responsibility nor the babysitting", "you're not in edmonton are you? someone gave someone their puppy outside a walmart here as they were going to be homeless, they didnt want the puppy to freeze, now they are more stable they wanted to try and get the dog back or know it was in a good home. NTA, i'd just move to your dads but check in to make sure the puppy and your siblings are okay.", "Absolutely not. \n\nWhats the saying: \"Not your circus, not your monkeys\". \n\nThey're not your kids to raise, and thats not your puppy to look after.", "Before the divorce your family was upper middle class.  Now, after the divorce, your mother is poor.  clearly your father has weaponized the money.\n\nFor all those years you struggled and now, because your siblings are thoughtless children, you're going to let your fathers strategy win.\n\nLeave but don't move in with the man who beggared his wife and children.\n\nYour father is the AH and no doubt your mother had a very good reason to leave him", "im not in edmonton but i hope they\u2019ll be able to get their dog back!!", "I don't think you need to worry so much. once you move out your mom will get tired of the other kids really quickly and I bet the little ones will be with you and and your dad within a month", "He needs to take her to court and have the custody agreement reevaluated, then.", "Now I see why they are divorced.", "Hopefully he starts putting his money where his mouth is. \n\nI don\u2019t have all the info so we don\u2019t know how he tries or if it\u2019s half hearted, lip service l, or your mom actively sabotages his effort.", "honestly you\u2019re not wrong", "Or if the teenagers are expected to pick up the slack when you move out,  It may not take too long to realised that your Dad's home is a better option!", "yes, if they wanted to he absolutely would. it\u2019s just a matter of if they want to or not, which the other teenagers don\u2019t because they don\u2019t want a present parent", "Wtf are you doing to yourself letting your narcissistic mother parentify you? Fucking move in with your dad, you\u2019re a child yourself even if legally an adult. Take your dog and don\u2019t look back. NTA", "Dad is likely not putting the responsibility on her. Family court is hell.", "So what shitty thing did your mom do to get your dad to leave her finally?", "If they have the option of living with your dad, and your mom has money she's squandering on liquor and men then you can take your dog and leave with impunity.", "YWNBTA - Move.", "Nta- move in with your dad, you will not thrive like this and your mom doesn't care.", "NTA but why isn\u2019t your dad stepping up more here too? Like why are you suddenly in poverty and without childcare to the point that you are raising the kids?", "NTA.\nMove out already! They will guilt you but so what. You can\u2019t live like this and they will absolutely not change", "NTA\n\nDon't discuss it with Mom.  Just move out.  Get out ASAP and put yourself first for a change.", "Well it's not your obligation to raise your siblings, your parents shouldn't be expecting that of you. Take the dog and move in with your dad.", "op=NTA\n\nGo! you are not their parent, Take your dog and get some peace in your life.", "So we don't know why they moved with the mom. We don't know custody situation so him being blamed is irrelevant. It sound like the mom was the default winner of custody in the hearing. \n\nBut nta for irresponsible parent and family wanting something they can't afford", "Suggest Dad ask for custody but allow the teens to choose if they want.    \nThat way at least he'd get the younger ones in a safer situation", "This may be the wake up call the teens need though.\n\nIF you go, Mom will make them take care of the younger ones(and themselves).  They may decide~~d~~ dad is the \"Greener grass\".", "Leave it to redditbto drag the dad despite op telling everyone he's doing everything he can for them. \n\nOp your mom is irresponsible and move out asap.\n\nEta: go live with your dad so you can save up this housing market is rough. If it's healthier with the dad then go and use it as a launch pad for yourself and save up.", "NTA, get out, now. At your age, you should be spreading your wings and becoming an adult, not raising your mother's kids for her. She's clipping those wings by doing this to you.", "Def NTA!", "NTA.  Your mom has put a lot of responsibility on your young shoulders; another dog (a puppy at that) is yet another--the others don't even care for the dog they already have, that was dumped on you as well.  None of this is fair to you, and none of this is your fault.", "Expressing your boundaries and needs and then enforcing them does not make you an asshole. \n\nNTA.", "Girl run!!", "that\u2019s exactly what i think i\u2019ll do. and thank you for this, dad is doing everything he can but there\u2019s a lot of limits because of where we live (moms almost always win). i\u2019ve been saving as much as i can here and i plan to do more when i get out", "thank you :)!", "thank you so much for this, it encourages me a lot. it\u2019s been really hard lately so i appreciate it", "NTA, OP, but I don't think you staying is helping the situation.\n\nYour teenage siblings are getting the best of both worlds right now. You are doing all the parent things like keeping the house clean and food on the table, but you have no authority over them. The utopia must end, otherwise they have no reason to leave and there is no proof that the littles are getting neglected because they are not. You are doing the work.\n\nI would suggest making a record of what the house looks like now so it can be compared to what it will look like once you leave. Then, take your dog and go. The puppy will be very useful in making your mom's place a disgusting hellscape of dog messes no one will clean up, but do try to leave plenty of food for it. \n\nThen sit back, regain your mental health, and wait for things to get bad enough that the teenage sibs chose to leave or your mom can be declared unfit and lose custody. Either way, that is your dad and his lawyers job. Also be careful not to let your sibs vent to you too much. You want them to stew in their situation so they will leave and providing them too much of an outlet will actually encourage them to put up with the situation longer.\n\nGood luck, OP!", "Also with high tension, make sure to keep cool in the mean time. It's already gonna be hard enough but when moving keep inventory of everything and prepare for mom retaliation when you do.", "I am twice your age, trust me when I say, you are being abused.  Get out now.  You owe it to yourself!  A 19 year old should not be taking care of their small siblings.  You should be going out with other 19 year olds, making stupid mistakes and having fun!  I have seen so many people fuck up their lives because they didn't get to do it in their younger years.  You're young, the stakes are still low, do it now.", "I would run away to my dads house.", "that\u2019s honestly a good idea", "thank you for this, i really appreciate it. all this support makes me feel a lot better making this decision, i was so caught up thinking it would be selfish", "she was using emotional blackmail and trying to weaponize the other kids against him, along with a lottttt more. the last few years they were together was hell"]}
