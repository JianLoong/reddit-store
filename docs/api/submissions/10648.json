You not following/siding with her likely kept y'all out of trouble.  But also- you thought something else happened with her not understanding. So regardless you wouldn't be the asshole. \n\nI do want to say though- I grew up assuming PMS was something all women experienced mostly the same and I couldn't understand why people always said it wasn't a good explanation for someone being more irritable (NOT excusing bad behavior but I always felt so crazy and bad and managing all that isn't always easy). \n \nTurns out I have PMDD, which is basically an extreme form of PMS where people can have a multitude of symptoms but feeling out of control and intense emotional reactions are commonly reported. I had never heard of it until I was talking to one of my doctors about my symptoms and time-line of onset. It may be something for her to look into. \n\nRegardless of that- I still am responsible for my interactions with others and it's my job to seek help and treatment so that I'm not out here being an ass to others.", "NTA. Blaming pms is a cop out. She needs to get in therapy or something to handle her behavior and out bursts.

Being rude like that is a choice, whether PMS is involved or not. It sounds like she uses it as an excuse to behave badly. Not supporting her for wanting to break rules doesn't make you an AH. Wanting to break them and calling you names makes her one though.", "NTA!!\n\nThis seems to go way beyond PMS based on what you\u2019ve written (and I say that as a woman who\u2019s dealt with severe PMS for years). What were you supposed to do?? Agree with her and get in trouble with security? Jesus. Even if you wouldn\u2019t have gotten in trouble, her behavior was totally out of line.

She completely overreacted.", "NTA. \n\nA SO isn't just a free partner in crime.", "NTA. Where I live in the US this rule is very common; beer garden @ an event and you can't take the drink outside of it.\n\nYou are not in the wrong. \"Defending\" your wife would be arguing about the rule, and that wasn't going to help because the rule certainly wasn't going to change. She's being silly. Why should you defend her?

I don't give af who you are. If you are being rude, I will tell you and support whoever you're being rude to. Typically when people say this it's because they have the abusive mentality that they don't have to have accountability for their shitty actions to you or others, and you have to side with their abusive actions out of loyalty to help them not take accountability for themselves. Absolutely not. NTA she needs a lesson in she's not the center of the fucking world", "NTA - You were in a foreign country at an event someone planned and put on.  Your participation in the event is conditional on following the rules.  And thinking a rule is stupid doesn't exempt you from following it.  \n  \nYour wife needs to understand that while her PMS may be hard for her, it doesn't entitle her to bad behavior with no consequence.  You can excuse it at the time, but she should still be able to recognize after the fact that she behaved poorly.  And she should recognize that you put up with her behavior, which isn't easy when she's berating you.  \n\nIf she doesn't feel bad, apologize for treating you poorly, and thank you for treating her well despite her behavior, you need to consider how to proceed in the relationship.  Because you don't want to spend the next 30 years being her punching bag.", "NTA. Your wife is though, for using PMS as an excuse not to regulate her emotions. She needs anger management and therapy. You may be willing to tolerate displays of anger like that (does it not raise your heart rate, stress, and anxiety??). But would you tolerate it for your kids?", "NTA.  It\u2019s important to be supportive, protective and considerate of your spouse, regardless of gender.  You were looking out for your wife by making sure she knew what the guard said so she doesn\u2019t get in trouble.  That\u2019s being protective.  She, on the other hand, was actively trying to put you in a bad situation by flouting the rules and apparently expected you to get into it with the guard.  That\u2019s inconsiderate and petulant at best.  Not only that, your wife was being rude to a guy who was only doing his job.  PMS is no excuse for that kind of behavior.", "NTA\n\nYeah you didn't do anything wrong. Your wife is definitely taking a strange stance.", "NTA... not totally sure what she was expecting you to \"defend her\" from... alcohol consumption laws? She doesn't speak the language fluently (how could she tell he was being rude?) and deliberately tried to obey a security guard because she didn't like the rule. I think it's kinda funny that she just expected you to know to disobey the security guard with her. side note, a significant other being short tempered is in no way an excuse to justify them treating workers doing their job that way. You probably need to have a more serious talk with her", "NTA - your wife is a nasty rude person however.", "NTA it\u2019s not my business but I\u2019m going to suggest it because it changed my life - has your wife looked into PMDD? I used to inexplicably be so impatient and angry and lash out but then I\u2019d also feel so low. When time would pass I\u2019d wonder why I was so upset because in hindsight, whatever upset me wasn\u2019t a big deal  even though it seemed like a major problem in the moment. It turned out they weren\u2019t natural feelings, they happened about the same time each month and it was a hormonal imbalance. One pill a day and I\u2019m able to manage my temper and reduce my mental lows around those times.\n\nShe could also just be a jerk, but since you mention the tie to her period and I assume she isn\u2019t always like this, thought I\u2019d bring it up.", "Hard NTA. Millions of women suffer from some really horrible PMS and don't use it as an excuse to behave badly. I know there are varying degrees of PMS but REALLY??? It isn't her job to make everyone suffer because she feels bad. It sounds like you were in a different country and some of those countries take their laws seriously. You did the right thing. I don't know if you have kids but I couldn't imagine the hell you will go through when and if she gets pregnant. Good Luck!!", "Also an out of the context example but suppose the wife of the police officer  injured your wife due to a fight they had, should the police office put your wife in jail, inspite of overwhelming evidence aginst his own wife , just cause he should always side with his wife right\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NTA, been there, it sucks.\nShe isn't likely to change though....", "NTA", "Nta although i see myself in your wife.

You need to see how poorly you were treated (and may be continue to be treated when something else bothers her). This is not healthy, OP.", "NTA.  If your wife's PMS is that bad, she should speak to her doctor because there are things that can help level the hormones and keep her from behaving like this.  I used to get horrible cramps.  That still didn't give me the right to treat other people the way she's treating you.", "Nta. Your wife has an anger problem and needs someone to talk to. Blaming pms is a cop out", "If you reversed the genders, we'd be saying she's abusive", "NTA. I get pretty emotional when I\u2019m PMSing  but I don\u2019t take it out on others. Your reaction was reasonable and what I would have done too. It doesn\u2019t sound like the guard was rude, he was just doing his job. I\u2019d have been annoyed but that\u2019s no reason to be mad at you or to end the trip. I know everyone is different but it seems to me like she needs some help handling her emotions. Even at my worst I recognize the problem and take a breather before reacting.", "This is interesting, I don't believe she talked to her doctor about this.\n\nTo be honest, I've been trying to get her to switch her gynecologist for a while now, I'm not a doctor and I hate judging other people's work, by I don't really like the way he approaches her issues.\n\nHe dismisses her complaints about mood swings and cramps, saying just \"*it's normal you just have to deal with it*\". I mean...yeah it could be normal, but the guy simply shrugs it off, even though she complains about cramp pains a LOT.\n\nI've grown up with 2 older sisters and my mom having PMS at the same time in my house, and none of them complained about pain as much as my wife...she regularly does pap smear and other exams, but the doctor never wanted to investigate further these issues, I feel he's not really a good doctor...", ">Does she normally throw things, slam things, punch walls, hit furniture? Generally express anger and frustration through striking things?  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Does she ever hit you? Even a swat on the arm when you say something she doesn't like?\r  \n\r\r\n\nNo, she never did any of that. She was never violent towards me, or anyone else really, and we've been together for 12 years now.  \n\n\nI'm not sure if I gave this impression, but just clarifying nevertheless: she didn't throw the coffee **at** me or at the security guy, or the ground, she threw in the garbage can before leaving the enclosed area.\n\nSorry, English is not my first language so I apologize if I made it sound like this.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

OP\n\nShe didn't throw it on the ground, she threw it at the garbage can", "Exactly. Having menstrual cramps or PMS does NOT give someone a free pass to abuse or ignore people. You would think having the Irish whiskey would have made her be a little more chill \ud83d\ude05.", "Yeah, she needs a new doctor.  A little bit of pain is one thing - if she's having a lot of pain, and serious mood swings, the above commenter is right, it could absolutely be PMDD, and her doctor should be listening to her and taking her concerns seriously. I got a diagnosis, and medication made a huge difference, I didn't realize how bad it was until I wasn't suffering anymore. But you need a doctor who will actually listen to you.", "I will definitely bring this up with her, I'll also add what I responded to another comment here..\n\nI've been trying to get her to switch her gynecologist for a while now, I'm not a doctor and I hate judging other people's work, by I don't really like the way he approaches her issues.\r  \n\r  \nHe dismisses her complaints about mood swings and cramps, saying just \"*it's normal you just have to deal with it*\".

They keep trying to tell me to take a break because you shouldn\u2019t do it for 6 years straight. I refuse lmao nothing ever helped my hormone levels more and as consistently as the depo.", "I've had an IUD 14 years.  Granted, 12 of those were hormone free.  This current one has hormones and is good for 7, at least.  Also took it as a teen/young adult (pill).  This is the first I'm hearing of a suggested limit.  Interesting..."]}
