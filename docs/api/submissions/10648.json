You not following/siding with her likely kept y'all out of trouble.  But also- you thought something else happened with her not understanding. So regardless you wouldn't be the asshole. \n\nI do want to say though- I grew up assuming PMS was something all women experienced mostly the same and I couldn't understand why people always said it wasn't a good explanation for someone being more irritable (NOT excusing bad behavior but I always felt so crazy and bad and managing all that isn't always easy). \n \nTurns out I have PMDD, which is basically an extreme form of PMS where people can have a multitude of symptoms but feeling out of control and intense emotional reactions are commonly reported. I had never heard of it until I was talking to one of my doctors about my symptoms and time-line of onset. It may be something for her to look into. \n\nRegardless of that- I still am responsible for my interactions with others and it's my job to seek help and treatment so that I'm not out here being an ass to others.", "NTA. Blaming pms is a cop out. She needs to get in therapy or something to handle her behavior and out bursts.

Being rude like that is a choice, whether PMS is involved or not. It sounds like she uses it as an excuse to behave badly. Not supporting her for wanting to break rules doesn't make you an AH. Wanting to break them and calling you names makes her one though.", "NTA!!\n\nThis seems to go way beyond PMS based on what you\u2019ve written (and I say that as a woman who\u2019s dealt with severe PMS for years). What were you supposed to do?? Agree with her and get in trouble with security? Jesus. Even if you wouldn\u2019t have gotten in trouble, her behavior was totally out of line.

She completely overreacted.", "NTA. \n\nA SO isn't just a free partner in crime.", "NTA. Where I live in the US this rule is very common; beer garden @ an event and you can't take the drink outside of it.\n\nYou are not in the wrong. \"Defending\" your wife would be arguing about the rule, and that wasn't going to help because the rule certainly wasn't going to change. She's being silly. Why should you defend her?

I don't give af who you are. If you are being rude, I will tell you and support whoever you're being rude to. Typically when people say this it's because they have the abusive mentality that they don't have to have accountability for their shitty actions to you or others, and you have to side with their abusive actions out of loyalty to help them not take accountability for themselves. Absolutely not. NTA she needs a lesson in she's not the center of the fucking world", "NTA - You were in a foreign country at an event someone planned and put on.  Your participation in the event is conditional on following the rules.  And thinking a rule is stupid doesn't exempt you from following it.  \n  \nYour wife needs to understand that while her PMS may be hard for her, it doesn't entitle her to bad behavior with no consequence.  You can excuse it at the time, but she should still be able to recognize after the fact that she behaved poorly.  And she should recognize that you put up with her behavior, which isn't easy when she's berating you.  \n\nIf she doesn't feel bad, apologize for treating you poorly, and thank you for treating her well despite her behavior, you need to consider how to proceed in the relationship.  Because you don't want to spend the next 30 years being her punching bag.", "NTA. Your wife is though, for using PMS as an excuse not to regulate her emotions. She needs anger management and therapy. You may be willing to tolerate displays of anger like that (does it not raise your heart rate, stress, and anxiety??). But would you tolerate it for your kids?", "NTA.  It\u2019s important to be supportive, protective and considerate of your spouse, regardless of gender.  You were looking out for your wife by making sure she knew what the guard said so she doesn\u2019t get in trouble.  That\u2019s being protective.  She, on the other hand, was actively trying to put you in a bad situation by flouting the rules and apparently expected you to get into it with the guard.  That\u2019s inconsiderate and petulant at best.  Not only that, your wife was being rude to a guy who was only doing his job.  PMS is no excuse for that kind of behavior.", "NTA\n\nYeah you didn't do anything wrong. Your wife is definitely taking a strange stance.", "NTA... not totally sure what she was expecting you to \"defend her\" from... alcohol consumption laws? She doesn't speak the language fluently (how could she tell he was being rude?) and deliberately tried to obey a security guard because she didn't like the rule. I think it's kinda funny that she just expected you to know to disobey the security guard with her. side note, a significant other being short tempered is in no way an excuse to justify them treating workers doing their job that way. You probably need to have a more serious talk with her", "NTA - your wife is a nasty rude person however.", "NTA it\u2019s not my business but I\u2019m going to suggest it because it changed my life - has your wife looked into PMDD? I used to inexplicably be so impatient and angry and lash out but then I\u2019d also feel so low. When time would pass I\u2019d wonder why I was so upset because in hindsight, whatever upset me wasn\u2019t a big deal  even though it seemed like a major problem in the moment. It turned out they weren\u2019t natural feelings, they happened about the same time each month and it was a hormonal imbalance. One pill a day and I\u2019m able to manage my temper and reduce my mental lows around those times.\n\nShe could also just be a jerk, but since you mention the tie to her period and I assume she isn\u2019t always like this, thought I\u2019d bring it up.", "Hard NTA. Millions of women suffer from some really horrible PMS and don't use it as an excuse to behave badly. I know there are varying degrees of PMS but REALLY??? It isn't her job to make everyone suffer because she feels bad. It sounds like you were in a different country and some of those countries take their laws seriously. You did the right thing. I don't know if you have kids but I couldn't imagine the hell you will go through when and if she gets pregnant. Good Luck!!", "Also an out of the context example but suppose the wife of the police officer  injured your wife due to a fight they had, should the police office put your wife in jail, inspite of overwhelming evidence aginst his own wife , just cause he should always side with his wife right\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NTA, been there, it sucks.\nShe isn't likely to change though....", "NTA", "Nta although i see myself in your wife.

You need to see how poorly you were treated (and may be continue to be treated when something else bothers her). This is not healthy, OP.", "NTA.  If your wife's PMS is that bad, she should speak to her doctor because there are things that can help level the hormones and keep her from behaving like this.  I used to get horrible cramps.  That still didn't give me the right to treat other people the way she's treating you.", "Nta. Your wife has an anger problem and needs someone to talk to. Blaming pms is a cop out", "If you reversed the genders, we'd be saying she's abusive", "NTA. I get pretty emotional when I\u2019m PMSing  but I don\u2019t take it out on others. Your reaction was reasonable and what I would have done too. It doesn\u2019t sound like the guard was rude, he was just doing his job. I\u2019d have been annoyed but that\u2019s no reason to be mad at you or to end the trip. I know everyone is different but it seems to me like she needs some help handling her emotions.

A little bit of pain is one thing - if she's having a lot of pain, and serious mood swings, the above commenter is right, it could absolutely be PMDD, and her doctor should be listening to her and taking her concerns seriously.

I couldn\u2019t figure out what it was and my dumb self figured it\u2019s just something I had to deal with (I wasn\u2019t very big on asking for help back then). I happened to skip my period one month and noticed it didn\u2019t happen at all. Talked to my CNM about it, got my pills prescribed continuously, and it\u2019s never happened again.

Turns out, physical pain/bad cramps can also be a symptom of PMDD (not as common as the emotional/anger/fatigue symptoms, but also not rare).\n\nHighly recommend checking out the physician directory on IAPMD - your wife's symptoms sound a lot like mine were before I found the right doctors and medications. Godspeed and good luck!", "I don't think they were asking due to only physical abuse concerns. They're asking because it's not only the outburst that's a sign of abuse, but the contempt for a boundary, orchestration of a conflict with you, and refusal to take accountability for her behavior. Is this behavior always in lock step with her cycle or does it vary? Does she come to you to take real accountability later when her hormones stabilize? It's possible that her cycle is the root cause, but the type of distorted thinking and behavior here is highly unusual and more commonly seen in abusive people.\n\nEmotional and psychological abuse can be very subtle, and that makes it insidious. Is there a pattern of her doing things like this during an event or outing? Especially holidays, your birthday, or events with your side of the family? Is there a pattern of her declaring that rules, guidelines, or boundaries shouldn't apply to her, especially boundaries that you have set? This might not be outright objection, but \"forgetting\" or trying to convince you they're stupid and you should drop them. Does she take accountability without request when she messes up or hurts your feelings? If you ask her to work on something, is she receptive and apologetic or defensive and angry? Does she create these scenarios often, in which she takes an inappropriate position and then accuses you of not having her back? This may also manifest as doling out harsh judgment on a situation that doesn't involve her. Like saying that her sister should divorce her husband because he doesn't make enough money, as an example.", "Thanks for clarifying. Throwing is still throwing. It is very aggressive and not an appropriate response to being upset.", "Has her doctor ever mentioned PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder)? \nIt\u2019s an extension of PMS, only with more severe symptoms such as mood swings, cramping, fluctuating energy, etc. \n\nI will add that it wasn\u2019t my gyno that helped me with that, it was a combination of my Therapist & psychiatrist.", "I posted a stand alone comment too, but please see if you can get her to get a second opinion.

I had to advocate for myself for far too long before I found someone who would listen to me. I\u2019m truly glad you recognize it because you can start to feel crazy when everyone is dismissing you.

I was starting to lose faith all the \"blaming PMS\" comments. I hit puberty on my 8th birthday exactly & got diagnosed at 13.

And then a few minutes later being clear headed again and realizing I shouldn't have been that angry, but nonetheless being unable to control it. It was terrifying not having control over my own emotions and body. This started when I was like 12/13 and I didnt get diagnosed until I was 23. I'm now on a combo of meds thats working for me (Yasmin and Cymbalta) and I have no outbursts or seething anger like this anymore.\n\nOP, there's a great organization called IAPMD (International Association of Pre Menstrual Disorders) that has a ton of resources, self screen tools, as well as a physician directory.
