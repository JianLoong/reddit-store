As I was going to bed (sometime after midnight) I looked out the window as I was closing my curtains and noticed that I could see the hot coals.  Really stupid but what the hell, if he burnt my house down I would sue his ass and re-build.  Assuming I survived, of course.\n\nAnyway, as I was closing the curtains I realized that it was windy so I just stood there for a few minutes and watched the fire.  The wind was coming from the north (thanks, Canada) and every time the wind came through, the hot coals would get really red, and eventually there were some flames.

And firebug like him never contain it as well as they should.", "Yet. Do you know how quickly fire spreads? \n\nA couple weeks ago I worked the radios for a \u201ccontrolled burn\u201d in a residential area that got out of control. It was a headache.", "You\u2019re an idiot.", "Our lawns are brown and dead. The sky is orange and filled with smoke. There is a fire ban for a reason. His fire pit is not lifted or surrounded in rocks, it\u2019s surrounded by dead grass. Just for context.", "A big part of concern right now is additional fires make the air pollution worse. You shouldn't mow your grass either.", "At best you are woefully misinformed - do you have any idea how far embers from a residential fire pit can travel?", ">Your neighbor's fire isn't doing any of that.\n\nyet.", "Fun fact: no wood burning fire is entirely contained! Ever been burned by an ember? I have several metres from a fire! And it wasn\u2019t even windy! Fire bans exist for a reason, and it\u2019s not to ruin people\u2019s summer plans.", "Stupid take", "Dead grass can catch fire, too. Grass fires can be as destructive as forest fires.", "When I was a kid I managed to burn the lawn with several centimeters of snow on it and a fire pit lifted off the ground- as it doesn't sound like the fire was properly contained (raised forepit on bricks or other insulating stuff, throughly watered grass below, etc) this can do way more damage. Grass fires can spread incredibly quickly, and even if OP doesn't care about their neighbor it'll likely spread to their property as well. \n\nAnyone with an \"as long as there's no trees fire can't spread\" attitude should not be around open flames, like, ever.", "If there's a fire ban and there's a fire near his home (intentional or not, contained or not), it 100% IS his business. NTA for sure.", "Thank you! I just replied to another comment but - all of the grass in our area is dead and brown. Anything can go wrong extremely quickly.", "Agreed. The method is questionable, (think you should just have called the cops) you did the right thing. Well done", "I was thinking about calling in a warning. I am on MAT leave currently so I will be the sneaky neighbour keeping an eye lol. I won\u2019t water his campfire again but the fire department will definitely be here for next time.", "Ours is a strict fire ban. None of that is allowed. We\u2019re even urged to not smoke near open fields, outdoor paths, etc unless we have a proper way or water to put the cigarette out.", "Where I'm at fire ban means no fire, regardless of what device is making it. No BBQ, no smoking, no candles, and no open fires. We are in a drought and shit will light a blaze from a tiny spark", "They mentioned watering all the wood in sight, so I imagine they mean open air campfire. Where I am, propane devices (ie BBQ, fire tables, etc) are still allowed, but anything with wood or the like as fuel is not.", "Last time we had a fire ban (in an area not usually prone to fires) smoking in the forests and near open fields as well as open flames anywhere were banned, including stuff like lighters. \n\nFire bans usually habe different stages based on severity of risk.", "Your comparisons are utterly absurd.", "Thank you for that!", "Since the serious fire threat and fire ban that OP is under?", "That\u2019s not exactly what I meant, I just meant it as in, seriously, you have to have a fire right now? While the sky is orange and filled with smoke. Some people will bbq out of necessity if they don\u2019t have a stove or an ac to keep their place cool while using their stove. It is still unacceptable where I am right now. No open fires are permitted whatsoever.", "so OP should\u2019ve called the police on the neighbor for having a fire? which would definitely be wasting resources?", "You're*", "You are seriously confused who is acting holier than thou. Only an idiot would start a fire in an area with a fire ban because the risk of fires and the existing pollution is too high. But I would have called the cops and or fire department on you to see your sanctimonious holier than thou self get taken down a few notches.", "This guy is right. Honestly I would find it hard to not have a controlled fire of this dudes house. \n\nHonestly if I were his neighbor I would be dead set on making this dudes life horrible. Literally would be getting into the first fist fight he has ever had that day.", "So your ego is so fragile that you would  get arrested/fined for violating a fire ban and \"taking someone down a few notches?\"", "What would they do? Fine him for putting out an illegal fire? \ud83e\udd28", "> to see your sanctimonious holier than thou self get taken down a few notches\n\nHuh? Taken down how?\nYou genuinely believe that police would side with the person breaking the law?", "HE ISSSS this person!", "I love your response", "Exactly! I feel like that was the main reason I didn\u2019t call, I felt I would be taking away from an actual emergency. This - I could handle on my own. It\u2019s so sad that people are like this.", "I thought it was funny.", "lol ok so did you put the fire out because you wanted to pick a fight with a neighbor your dislike, or because of your concern for fire?", "Well then just admit you did that out of spite not out of some \u201csafety\u201d bs.", "Sounds like you are the asshole", "I agree with you.  Hence my suggestion to call the fire department.  If there is a burn ban, they should respond and even ticket the guy to hopefully prevent such behavior.  They will enter his property with fire extinguishers and hoses to put out his campfire.  And teach him a better lesson than the neighbor ever could.\n\nI lived next door to a crazy neighbor.  I value coming home to and living in peace/quiet.  Let the fire department take the brunt of the neighbor's ire.", "Exactly, and that guy already said eff the neighborhood let\u2019s keep the poor air quality going with a bonfire", "This is 100% what they\u2019re there for and it has the potential to be a real emergency. They can also make sure it\u2019s 100% out, no hot spots that\u2019ll reignite. People are unpredictable and you never know how they\u2019re gonna respond. Send the guys and gals with firehoses and axes \ud83e\ude93", "Oh thanks!! I\u2019m just the dispatcher tho : )", "I guess it depends on where you are. Most of places i've lived where they've instituted burn bans, it was pretty much strictly because of air quality that was affected by fires 100s of miles away. If you're living somewhere with an imminent fire risk then NTA.", "Yes. Why?", "Snowy regions have summer seasons and fire bans too. There are many fires in Canada right now.", "lol. There are so many places I've lived where burn bans are put in place where there is no imminent fire risk. They're often placed in an extremely wide area and targeting air quality rather than actual fire risk for 99% of the people in the affected area.", "He could have had a gun though, or hurt you really bad. Let the police handle that.", "Are you in NS?", "They literally agreed it was probably the only right way to handle it. Op was an a-hole, but needed to be in this case. Idiots don't always listen to someone being nice.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from. However in this case they most likely would\u2019ve sent out a police officer to ask them to put it out and issue a fine or warning. Just because something is fire related doesn\u2019t mean a firefighter will come out.", "I\u2019m still gonna say YTA.  Call it in and let someone else enforce it.  You risk starting a neighborhood spat.", "Then absolutely NTA. That's not contained at all, but definitely call the authorities next time. He may know it was you who called, but he'll be less likely to do it a third time with the ban in place.", "These AH's don't even realize what they're doing and who they could be harming. \n\nSadly I would say they do know, they just don't care.", "Poor Smokey! He became the cause of the thing he was meant to destroy: https://www.npr.org/2012/08/23/159373691/how-the-smokey-bear-effect-led-to-raging-wildfires", "From souther cali who has been there done that, best wishes for you to remain as safe as you can out there.", "Not anymore!", "Could be too late by the time they get there", "If there is a burning ban call 911 as soon as you see the flames.", "Rather than trespass on their property? Yeah, police would have been better.", "You sound pretty dumb. I bet you are a bit of a wet blanket or that your life never turned out exactly how you thought it would and are somewhat depressed and depressing to be around.", "Oh, no. I agree the neighbor is an asshole. \n\nI know what a burn ban is. I currently live in an area with a burn ban. The neighbor is most definitely also an arrogant asshole.", "We already knew.", "No, none of this was based solely on previous events. Although, I may have not done it to a nicer neighbour, but they wouldn\u2019t be stupid enough to have a fire during a fire ban. I couldn\u2019t read my book outside today because my eyes burned so badly from the smoke. The sky is orange, smoke everywhere. I was outside to water my grass because I am terrified of anything landing on my lawn and starting something. I have 2 kids, 1 on the way and I have a dog. Once anything hits my area/ my lawn, it\u2019s out of my control.", "Mm, no. If you could see our skies right now you would think differently. If he were a nice neighbour, yes, I would have treated him differently. Though, my nice neighbours aren\u2019t idiots and wouldn\u2019t light a fire in the first place.", "Oh, hun. *facepalm*", "Nova Scotia has a $25k fine for burning anything right now because things are so dry and they\u2019re already badly overstretched dealing with existing fires. I\u2019m mostly familiar with burn bans as a \u201cthings are too dry to risk it\u201d measure, and especially right now some places are being *very* harsh having an open flame.", "Having seen bushfires mere km from my house, having been waiting and watching them creep closer and closer... OP is NTA. If shit is on fire, you don't go lighting more fires.", "Well, because by definition of a fire ban, they're not a killjoy, the neighbor was actively breaking the law.\n\nEdit to add: you don't have to be in a forest for a fire to be dangerous", "True, I was just trying to point out that the previous commenter doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.", "The fire bans are put in place for very good reasons. It is usually because fire risk is high, even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it to you. It\u2019s also often because there are so many fires that there are not enough resources to battle more potential fires. Please don\u2019t disregard fire bans.", "Where I live people have died because some idiot threw a cigarette butt out the window.", "Yes. On brink of evacuation", "Fires, especially those surrounded by dead grass and other fuels (twigs, etc) can spread so fast. It sounds like the houses in their neighborhood are pretty close. I don\u2019t want one of his embers flying up into OP\u2019s attic vents and taking his house with it.", "Better a spat than ashes and cinders.", "Neighbor already started a spat when he took the initiative to cut down one of OPs bushes. Although I don't think OP actually did this in retaliation, neighbor absolutely had it coming. OP still should've called the authorities instead of sinking to neighbor's level though.", "Who cares? A spat won't mean anything if the neighborhood is gone because of one jackass not wanting to obey a fireman.  And forest or not, he could have put the entire neighborhood at risk.  I'd rather soak some wood and not talk to a neighbor than risk losing my home because of entitled assholes like this guy", "This is also true! Just so insane to me.", "Yeah, so there was no \u201cbest\u201d way to solve the problem", "Don\u2019t call 911 for that. It is not an emergency unless the flames are out of control.  Save that for an actual emergency.  As someone that took 911 calls I would be extremely pissed at being call for a campfire in a fire pit even during a burn ban.", "Nah you showed your bias. You wanted to get back at this guy, or you have a crush on him. I\u2019m not sure but you need to know that you think you\u2019re being logical but you are in fact being emotional", "You\u2019re just doubling down on my point. You\u2019re saying you would have acted differently if you didn\u2019t already dislike him. That\u2019s what spite is. He\u2019s an asshole 100%, but so are you.  The fact that you don\u2019t like him doesn\u2019t change that. That doesn\u2019t give you a free pass to go do whatever you want in somebody else\u2019s yard.", "oH hUN.. durp", "It's beaurocracy. Jaywalking is also breaking the law. Doesn't mean you should hose someone down for crossing the street illegally.", "I agree with you about that.", "All the better to call the coos on the fire ban instead of making this worse.\n\nBy throwing water in the neighbor\u2019s fire it destroyed the proof, and lets the neighbor claim that op is the aggressor.", "Oop your misogyny is showing", "Lol, if one of my nice neighbours also refused to put out a fire during a fire ban, I would have done the same thing.  We\u2019re advised to pack a bag and have ID\u2019s ready to go to evacuate. Just no one is stupid enough to have a fire as the neighbour I have who is already an AH is.", "The last time there was a fire ban where I live some asshole ignored it and people DIED trying to contain it. It's not just them being a killjoy. Fire bans are to protect people, homes, and wildlife and where I live farmland that our country depends on.", "Not quite the same thing, but nice try.", "Jaywalking doesn't put my home at risk of catching fire, nor does it put my child or pets at risk of smoke inhalation or burning to death.", "Jaywalking doesn't put all your neighbors' homes at risk. Lighting fires during a fire ban does.", "Lol what makes you think I\u2019m not a woman? I will tell you it\u2019s hard to be logical when you are emotional. Are you suggesting that men assume women are emotional? Are you assuming women are emotional?", "You're the one that brought up laws. I'm sure you understand my point.", "Are you suggesting that woman can\u2019t be misogynistic? I know a couple woman that are. Also I wasn\u2019t only talking about the emotional part? I was also talking about you assuming she must have a crush on him and being all logic with no emotion doesn\u2019t make you level headed it makes you hard to tolerate by your peers", "I do understand what you're trying to convey, but you need a better comparison, jaywalking is not even close to having a campfire during a fire ban. There are many different levels of laws (hence the different punishments for breaking each). You're lucky if you live in an area where fire bans aren't actually a necessity. Depending on where OP lives, what the neighbor was doing was extremely dangerous, not to mention selfish. A fire doesn't have to be in a forest to spread and kill people, especially during dry seasons.", "Yup. Your point was a non-point. Because risking your own individual safety by jaywalking is not comparable to risking the safety and lives of those around you by starting a fire during a fire ban. \n\n\nA better comparison would be drunk driving, or something. Because that *actually* endangers others, unlike jaywalking."]}
