Really stupid but what the hell, if he burnt my house down I would sue his ass and re-build.  Assuming I survived, of course.\n\nAnyway, as I was closing the curtains I realized that it was windy so I just stood there for a few minutes and watched the fire.  The wind was coming from the north (thanks, Canada) and every time the wind came through, the hot coals would get really red, and eventually there were some flames.

And yet the next day I was getting into a taxi and overheard my neighbours say let's do that barbeque tonight for Victoria day. And the wife just goes but hunny there is a fire ban and the field yesterday. The husband was like yeah that was on the other side of town. It's fine. I walked away took out my garbage and thought clearly not? They wouldn't like everyone's lawn is brown here and ded. And there is water restrictions on watering your lawnmower they wouldn't be so stupid? And then legit my windows are open and I smell their campfire. I called the police they said they would report it to the fire station. And thanked me.

Sounds like you know it, but just in case someone else might be unsure, the rules are similar to all abuse of emergency service laws. Any scenario in which a reasonable person of sound mind might deem a red flag worth investigating is a good enough reason to call. If you\u2019re not sure, it\u2019s their job, as well as the dispatcher\u2019s, to help determine if there\u2019s an emergency.

Not ok. \n\nCalling the cops because you noticed strange markings behind your house that might have indicated you\u2019re being cased, but then it just turned out to be raccoon tracks on the dumpster? Perfectly cromulent reason to call- you do have a bandit scoping things out. It\u2019s just in animal control\u2019s jurisdiction. Calling them to report a kidnapping because your neighbor conspired to have the neighborhood raccoon you\u2019d been trying to tame for MONTHs now stolen away from you out of sheer spite (she never could get over the fact that you beat her in that casserole competition at the fair 4 years running, and now she\u2019s *clearly* out to make your life miserable)? Not ok. \n\nCalling the fire dept during a burn ban to report a neighbor\u2019s backyard fire? Totally golden. Calling them just to ask how their day was? Or prank calling them?

I feel like all these people are American suburbanites (no offence intended by that statement) who don't actually understand how *bad* fires can get in some countries. Where I live, entire towns burned to the ground a couple years back. We lost *whole towns*.
