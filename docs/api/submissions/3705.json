We were supposed to go to my family Thanksgiving this year since his family lives out of state and we are trying to save money.  But one of my BF's relatives was recently diagnosed with a terminal illness so my BF decided to go to his family Thanksgiving because this will most likely be his relatives last one.  He wanted me to go with him, but I couldn't really afford it.  He couldn't afford to pay for my ticket in addition to his, so I ended up going to my family for the holiday.  My BF said he understood, but I could tell he was disappointed and maybe even a little mad at me.\n\nThe airport is almost an hour from where we live so I did bring him to the airport for his flight, I figured it was the least I could do.  I also told him I would pick him up when he got back, but I wasn't able to do that.  \n\nHe got back this past Sunday but there was an emergency at my job.  I work as a manager in retail and I was working a shift Sunday morning, but was supposed to get off in time to pick my BF up.  We had a situation come up at my job that ended up involving the police.  Since I was the only manager on duty at the time, I had to stay to help provide access to security videos as well as provide a statement.  I tried so hard to get out of there as soon as I could, but the situation was out of my control and I had to stay much later than I was supposed to.  Like 4 hours later.  I was at least able to send my BF a text explaining the situation.  I apologized so many times and told him that he's probably better off just finding another way to get home.  \n\nI had to stay so late at my job that my BF actually beat me home.  He had gotten a friend to come get him.  When I got home, I could tell my BF was not in a good mood.  I tried to talk to him about his trip and told him how happy I was that he was back, but he completely blew me off. No matter how much I apologized or tried to explain, he just told me he didn't want to talk to me.\n\nHe pretty much gave me the cold shoulder for the next 2 days.  He wouldn't even come to bed at the same time as me and stayed up late playing video games. Last night I finally got him to talk to me but he was just being mean.  He told me he feels like I abandoned him twice.  The first time for not making it work to come with him on an emotionally draining trip when he needed my support, and then again when I didn't pick him up at the airport.\n\nI tried to explain how both of those situations were completely out of my control and that I've apologized numerous times for both things.  He said that my explanations just sound like excuses to him and that he feels the way he feels.\n\nI told him that doesn't give him the right to make me feel more sh!tty than I already do and that the least he could do is have some compassion for how bad I feel too.", "created_utc": 1669918273, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9uy06/aita_for_not_going_with_my_bf_to_his_family/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The more i think about this, the more i see abuse by your bf. RUN!", "NTA. You'd have gone if you could, both times. But want to doesn't make money appear, nor keep you from getting fired. Not sure if your BF is normally this unreasonable, or if the shock of the news is impacting his behavior.", "NTA. And this is a good look at your future. He is a grown ass man acting like a child. Both situations were out of your control and he is being a baby.", "NTA...he keeps up the childish attitude and then he can see how he likes being single, no one deserves to be treated like that.", "You had a situation happen at work that was completely beyond your control, and he had to find a ride to take him home. That\u2019s not your fault, and he had other means to get there. Things happen.\n\nYour boyfriend stonewalled you for two days because he was pouting about the fact that you couldn\u2019t afford to accompany him to visit his family, and then he holds it against you that you couldn\u2019t pick him up from the airport because you got held up by the police- which he calls \u201cabandonment\u201d.\n\nMy husband used to be like this early on in the relationship. I gave him an ultimatum. He had to work on his behavior to save the relationship when I was the only one trying to make it work or I was done with it. He chose to work on his behavior, and things drastically improved from there. It can work, but only if your boyfriend wants to change.\n\nStonewalling someone is abusive. Ignoring their attempts to communicate and shutting them out for days is not a way to work your problems out. Making your problems worse by refusing to talk it out is not going to make your relationship last, it\u2019s going to break it up. I would suggest an ultimatum because even though you aren\u2019t me, I\u2019m assuming this is a regular pattern of behavior. If he continues to blame you and get angry with you for things that are not your fault and treats you this way, I would then end the relationship.\n\nYou are a human being with feelings, and you don\u2019t have to tolerate anyone hurting them or using manipulation to make you feel bad for things outside of your control.

You let him know you couldn't pick him up and why. He made it home. You didn't abandon him.\n\nI think you should seriously reconsider this relationship.", "NTA.  Feelings aren't always rational.  He sacrificed to see a relative for what will likely be the last time.  It isn't an excuse for bad behavior, but he needed you and you couldn't be there.  However, not accepting your explanations is self-centered on his part.  I'd be interested to see how long it takes him to cool down.  You might want to re-consider the relationship if he can't let go of it.  Part of relationships is forgiving each other.  If he can't forgive when you couldn't make it work *through no fault of your own*, that is on him.", "Nta. Tell him to put his big boy pants on & grow up. Plans changed & neither of you could afford your ticket - what were you meant to do walk? Then you couldn't collect him because WORK. He sounds ridiculously immature, a bit of a bully & is showing you how he deals with disappointment.", "NTA he is acting like a big baby. Your life doesn\u2019t revolve around him so why does he act like it does? You had a valid reason for not going on the trip - no funds and you were physically unable to go pick him up due to an emergency. Sounds like your BF needs a reality check.", "NTA - Excuse me, you're dealing with cops and having to give statements and this is all part of your job and that's \"just excuses\"? He couldn't afford your ticket to go with him and neither could you--you were supposed to just wave your magic wand for the cash and so your reason for not going is an \"excuse\".  Give yourself a great Christmas present of a new bf; this one is not mature enough to be in a relationship and he's toxic as hell to boot.", "NTA you couldnt' go with him because of finances and he couldn't pay for you either.  You told him you couldn't pick him up as soon as you knew you were going to be late.  You haven't done anything wrong and don't need to apologise.  Does he behave like this a lot?", "NTA. If he wants space, give him all he needs. He has at least one friend where he could\u2019ve gone if he didn\u2019t want to communicate with you. But to stay there in the same space and treat you as invisible after you\u2019ve apologized countless times, for things that we\u2019re out of your control, is not the material that good boyfriends are made from. Frankly, I\u2019d leave and find someone who has more consideration for his mate.", "NTA what the hell?  You had cops at the store you manage, not like you were at the bar with friends getting wasted.  I can't help but feel you walking out of work would have potentially caused you legal issues?  Would probably get you fired if not worse.", "NTA. He may be dealing with an ill family member and some other issues; he could lean on you for those issues by talking to you about it.\n\nHowever, he is being an incredibly shitty partner. No empathy. Blaming you for things that are out of your control. Giving the cold shoulder. Not taking responsibility for his actions (he's right that he has feelings, but this is about *how he is treating you*). He is being unreasonable and taking his feelings out on you, which is immature and actually emotionally abusive. I'm sorry he's showing what a terrible partner he is.", "NTA. You can't just tell the cops \"hold on, I have to pick up my adult boyfriend who is perfectly capable of finding his own way home during this emergency situation.\" You were in a tough spot, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA.   \n\n\nSounds like your boyfriend has some unresolved abandonment issues that he should work on. He seems as if he's in a difficult place but...being unrealistic with the expectations for you. And if he wants your support, he has to communicate, not give you a cold shoulder. It really feels as if he's the asshole but if it was my significant other who started acting this way, I would really try to help the person work on this. He just found out that his family member is going to die, maybe it's worth a try. Just to clarify, I'm not saying that you're the asshole. I think that what you're feeling is absolutely legit.", "NTA. If you didn\u2019t have the money to go what exactly did he expect you to do? If it was that important to your boyfriend to have you go with him then HE should have found a way to buy your plane ticket. And as for picking him up he\u2019s being completely unreasonable; would he have been mad if you missed picking him up because you had a car accident on the way to the airport? Your work situation was just as unavoidable. So he\u2019s disappointed by things that couldn\u2019t be helped and totally blaming and taking it out on you. Some red flags here.", "NTA.  He is may be projecting his anger about his relative's impending death onto you.  You have done nothing wrong.  When you were stuck at work you did text him to let him know.  He's a big boy he can figure out how to get home (and he did).", "NTA. Dude gets to feel how he feels but he doesn't get to punish you for it.", "NTA, life happens.", "I'm going to say NAH.\n\nHe was upset.  It's a human emotion.  We can't always choose when we are upset. \n\nHe needed some time/distance to deal with it.  But you just couldn't let him have it.  You kept pushing at him.\n\nIT really sounds like he just needed some time alone to process it, but you failed to give him that.\n\n>  No matter how much I apologized or tried to explain, he just told me he didn't want to talk to me.\n\nExactly;  next time, give him some space.", "NTA- But you shouldn\u2019t expect compassion from him either because he was in a hard situation where you didn\u2019t comfort him so you can\u2019t expect the same from him. I think your reasons are pretty valid- not having enough money and the whole emergency thing. It\u2019s not like you overslept or were so tired. It\u2019s okay that he\u2019s upset and wants space because his feelings are valid.", ">I also told him I would pick him up when he got back, but I wasn't able to do that.  \n>  \n>The airport is almost an hour from where we live  \n>  \n>told him that he's probably better off just finding another way to get home.\n\nYTA you left him stranded at the airport, its not like he could just call an Uber. You should have called someone else in from work.\n\n>He told me he feels like I abandoned him twice. The first time for not making it work to come with him on an emotionally draining trip when he needed my support, and then again when I didn't pick him up at the airport.\n\nThe first one, I see how he feels that way but if neither of you can afford it then that's just how it is. As for the second one he should be livid. You did abandon him and leave him stranded.\n\n>I told him that doesn't give him the right to make me feel more sh!tty than I already do and that the least he could do is have some compassion for how bad I feel too.\n\nHe gets to be mad and frustrated with you - if that makes you feel shitty then that's on you.", "NAH\n\nAs far as not picking him up at the airport, I'm sure it was a hassle for him, but it's not like you just ditched him for no reason, it was a work emergency, outside of your control, so I don't think you deserve to be blamed for that... it's just shitty timing.  If the problem at your work hadn't happened, you would have been there.  You've apologized, there's not much else you can do.\n\nAs far as going to visit his family for the holiday, it's hard to judge without more information how important it was to him that you go.  You certainly have a sound reason why you chose not to, but if it was really, really important to him, you probably could have scraped the money together and made it happen.\n\nOne other thing to consider is that dealing with family during the holidays, especially with a family member having a terminal illness is pretty stressful and emotionally draining.  Travelling during the holidays is always stressful too (long lines, tons of people, etc.).  So, probably a big part of what is going on is that he was already really stressed out because of the trip, his dying relative, etc., and unfortunately that stress is boiling over onto you (which isn't really fair, but that's life).", "YTA\n\nBring on the downvotes. It\u2019s not your fault that neither of you could afford the trip for you. It\u2019s not your fault something came up at work and you couldn\u2019t pick him up like you said you would. What makes you the AH is he clearly said he didn\u2019t want to talk and you continued to push him. He wanted space and communicated as much. \n\nHe\u2019s in a tough place right now and people want to put all the blame on him. When men don\u2019t show emotion they\u2019re wrong but when they do they\u2019re still wrong. That\u2019s not your fault and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad. He shared his feelings. You want compassion but aren\u2019t giving it. You apologized and wanted to talk and he said he didn\u2019t want to talk to you. You feel bad, but so does he. You wanted to talk right then but he didn\u2019t. Some people want time and space before getting into things. He\u2019s emotionally drained from his trip and you want to push for an emotional discussion about what happened. \n\nHad he just ignored you and not said he didn\u2019t want to talk, I would agree he was being unfair. He told you he didn\u2019t want to talk. This whole thing is about you. You wanted him at your family\u2019s gathering, you wanted to talk, you want compassion. He explained how he feels and you say he\u2019s just been mean because you feel bad. I feel like he\u2019s got a point because of the \u201che decided\u201d to go visit his terminal family member.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It takes two to communicate, and once he abandons communication, that means he\u2019s not wanting to fix the issue because he\u2019s trying to make you feel bad. An ultimatum will let him know that you\u2019re serious and you will leave him if he continues to sulk and ignore you like this.\n\nI\u2019ve been through it many times, and I do believe that they do this to guilt trip you into feeling bad and having you apologize. It\u2019s essentially a way for people like this to control the situation and a power play to make you the one who feels an enormous amount of pain and heartache even when they\u2019re doing wrong. He wants to make you feel small and the more pain you are in is what makes them feel more powerful.\n\nIt sounds twisted, and that\u2019s because it is. This is what abusive people do and some of them don\u2019t even realize they are doing it even if it\u2019s not normal behavior from them. Usually it\u2019s learned behavior, which I\u2019m not going to get into that because it\u2019s an even longer discussion, but basically, you have to show him it\u2019s not bothering you and to call him out on it or he will keep doing it to you because when you give into him to try to get him to talk to you, it\u2019s getting him what he wants.", "But he didn't say that, and it's been 2 days.  Plus he's actively avoiding her.  That's giving someone the silent treatment.", "I stand by what I said: the silent treatment is emotional abuse. Respectfully asking for space and time to process your feelings is something entirely different - and that is not what OP\u2019s boyfriend did.", "A taxi or Uber to our place from the airport would have been almost $100.  He didn't want to spend that after buying his plane ticket, which is why I agreed to pick him up in the first place.  I think he ended up giving his friend like $50 or something.", "Taxi's generally don't do long haul trips such as this, if they do offer long haul services they generally need to be booked in advance.", "At the very least she should have called her boss and/or tried to reach out to a relative or friend in advance to see if they could go to the airport in her place. \n\nOP leaving him stranded wasn't okay.", "She should do that because she needs time to think. Not to teach him a \"very hard lesson\" that's just flat out stupid.", "I'm very much a person who wears my emotions on my sleeve.  Faking it is next to impossible for me.  I hate the idea of an ultimatum because that seems so absolute.  I just wanted him to talk to me so I could explain but he kept telling me to leave him alone and that I was being a nag while he was trying to clear his head and process things.", ">No matter how much I apologized or tried to explain, he just told me he didn't want to talk to me.\n\nHe's allowed to avoid her. OP is totally disregarding that he's said she doesn't want to talk and pestering him nonstop. OP is TA.", "Agree. He's punishing her for something that was out of her control, and he's making a meal out of it.", "Correction: that\u2019s what OP is telling us the boy friend did.\n\n\nIt\u2019s quite possible he\u2019s mad, told her to leave him alone, and she keeps pestering him and trying to apologize (which is what it sounded like to me) because he\u2019s obviously upset and she wants to fix it. That could get someone more upset since they can\u2019t calm down in the first place.", "That's insane.", "Right, but not wanting to pay for a cab is different from not having cabs available. It sucks you weren't able to honor your promise, but you had an emergency, and people take cabs to and from airports all the time.", "Almost an hour away is not that long? I live about 45 min from an airport... I don't have a car. Can't think of anywhere I lived where it wasn't at least a half hour drive to an airport.", "Two days of suffering from the silent treatment is too long for someone to inflict pain like this on someone else, and he knows it\u2019s making you feel bad which he wants. He\u2019s painting you out to be the bad guy for not being able to accompany him and also not being able to pick him up even though all of this was outside your control.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to issue an ultimatum- I only mentioned this if he continues to repeatedly do that after this, but you do need to let him know that this is not something you will tolerate. Sometimes once people start doing this, they will keep doing during arguments when they realize that it works. It makes you suffer a tremendous amount, and gets you to apologize, but no matter how agonizing it is, you should not apologize period because you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. He needs to apologize because he is the one who *is* doing wrong.\n\nYou definitely cannot allow this to keep happening in your relationship. Trust me when I say that I\u2019ve been through extreme mental abuse before. The more this is done to you, it will eat you from the inside out and will ultimately end up destroying you.", "Isn\u2019t she, though? \n- \u201cdidn\u2019t want to talk to me\u201d\n-\u201cblew me off\u201d\n-\u201cgave me the cold shoulder\u201d\nWhy is he allowed to tell her that he feels \u201cabandoned\u201d and not supported but when she tries to explain her side he shuts her down?", "I\u2019d be pissed if I was him. He gets off a plane expecting you there, and you\u2019re not. Annoying. I also get you had no choice. He should be over this in a day or two tops. NTA.", "He is being unreasonable and self centered. You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA  - I hate to break it to you but your BF is emotionally abusive and selfish. Be very careful with this relationship.", "NTA if this was just you not feeling like going or not wanting to pick him up, yeah sure, but BOTH situations are ones you couldn't have helped. If you can't afford a trip you can't afford it. And if my SO was in a situation that involved the police to the degree that it sounds like yours did then I'd be more worried about them than about having to take an Uber home - which wasn't even the case, he still got someone to give him a ride on short notice, he's super lucky.", "INFO: Which family member?  If we are talking about someone he is extremely close to, then that makes a huge difference on whether or not his reaction is understandable.  I don't think you're an AH, because you can't help your financial situation or work issues, but I wouldn't be comfortable calling him an AH too if his mom is dying.", "NTA \n\nUnless you can magic money out of thin air, the last minute trip over a holiday weekend was unaffordable. If you had made it work, then what would you not be paying next month? Rent, car, utilities or not eating? If he couldn't afford to pay for you, then would have he been willing to cover you over things that couldn't be paid due to buying the tickets?\n\nYou didn't ask for the incident to happen. You didn't ask to be the only manager on shift. You didn't ask or want to be kept at work longer than you needed to be, as you had plans and did try to keep them. You apologised and told him he needed to find a way home with as much notice as you could. All of this was unavoidable unless you can predict the future?\n\nThe cold shoulder is a manipulative AH tactic to get you to talk/apologise further to him. Stop. You did nothing wrong. You didn't go on a trip you couldn't afford, regardless of the situation and couldn't, despite your best efforts get out of work. \n\nHe isn't coming across great here tbh. He's expecting you to drop everything for him, including time, money and possibly(certainly if you'd left) your job. I get he has had some bad news, but it isn't your fault. Blaming you and saying you 'abandoned' him is dickish. He wasn't left alone or stranded.", "Giving someone the silent treatment *is* abusive behavior. You are NTA but he certainly is.", "This technique is called stonewalling and is one of the four horsemen of relationships. I highly recommend reading about it through the Gottman institute. He can choose to not talk about it right now and tell you when he would like to discuss it, but refusing to talk about it and telling you to leave it alone and then giving you the cold shoulder that is behavior that is not conducive to a meaningful relationship.", "Sorry, but I was married to someone like this. Abuse can be indirect. It's not always about yelling and hitting. Some abusers punish you prolonged silent treatments, making you beg for mercy and emotional intimacy. They might punish you in small ways like refusing to unlock the passenger door of the car until they're good and settled in. They might abuse you by making you feel that their wants and job are more important than yours. They might subtly imply that other men's girlfriends or wives are better than you. \n\nThese indirect micro-aggressions are very effective at making you eager to please, to  try vainly to be a better a partner when your abuser is never going to to give you credit for that. They want to make you feel humiliated and like a failure. In other words, it's emotional abuse.", "He is abusive. He is giving you the silent treatment.\n\nI bet you money that when he went home he got an earful from his family of you not being there. It is trickling down. But remember, none of this is your fault. (1) You didn\u2019t have the funds (2) no one is going say fuck you to the police and be taken to jail. That\u2019s just stupidity.", "He's behaving like a five-year-old.\n\nAny rational adult would understand hey, shit happens (like emergencies at work) and the fact it was out of your budget to fly to his family for Thanksgiving. I would have said he's the AH just for being grumpy about you not spending money you don't have on a plane ticket but then he went full on tantrum when you weren't able to pick him up from the airport.\n\nrun away from this guy. He's only going to get worse.", "Oooooooh.\n\nHow close was he with this person? If this is out of character for him, seeing the person's mortality in person may be hitting him pretty hard.", "Either way, he\u2019s telling you how *he* feels but not letting you have a voice. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "You stated that so perfectly! Wow. Thank you.", "I hope you're not going through something similar.", "Saying that he's too upset to talk about this right now, but ask her to give him a little time and they will discuss it [in a few hours, or tomorrow, or some other time in the very near future] \u2013 that is reasonable. Stonewalling her for days on end is not. That is AH, abusive behavior.\n\nSee this comment for a clear, brief explanation of why: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9uy06/aita_for_not_going_with_my_bf_to_his_family/iyk8eed?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3"]}
