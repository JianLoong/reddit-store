Really?  \n\n\nFirst of all, many jobs just want -a- degree, because it shows you've broadened your horizons, learned some skills, etc.  (Broadened horizons is why even those with medical degrees are required to take English classes and why those going into English have to take science classes.)  \n\n\nSecond, you have no idea what her degree could lead to.    \n\n\nI am the proud possessor of what you'd consider a useless degree.  I have a degree in History.  Do you know what getting that taught me?  How to research, how to analyze sources, how to expand or summarize data, and much, much more.    \n\n\nAm I a rich doctor?  Nope.  Am I a rich lawyer?  Also, nope.

Do you want her to become a well-paid doctor, even if she's not drawn to that work and may even be miserable studying and working towards something she doesn't like?
