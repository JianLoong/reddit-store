It was obviously an unplanned pregnancy and it resulted in my son's girlfriend getting kicked out of her house by her mom. I never liked this girl, but I obviously couldn't let her on the streets now that she's carrying my grandchild, so I let her live in our house. Now both she and my son gave up on college for the near future and my son is now working a full time job so he can provide for them in the future.\n\nThe problem is that his girlfriend refuses to do anything, but absolutely anything all day, she just locks herself up in my son's room eating snacks and watching videos on (my son's) computer. I need to drag her out to just help me with cooking and to clean up at least the room she's staying, but she's always b\\*tching about how I'm working her like a slave even tho she's already in constant pain cause of her pregnancy and then she'll come crying to my son about my treatment of her. Mind you, she doesn't have a high risk pregnancy (I know that cause me and my husband are the ones fully paying for her medical controls) and I don't put her up to do tasks like cleaning the toilet or anything similar.\n\nHowever she really crossed the line when after I got dressed up she asked me where I was going and when I told her that I'm getting ready for church, her exact response was: \"I didn't know there were churches that were allowing people looking like striptease dancers in\". At that point I absolutely had it with her and I told her straight that I don't care who tf she is, I won't allow her to disrespect me while living in my house and if she can't keep her attitude in check then she can get tf out of my home. She pretty much started crying at that point and immediately called my son, who later on also gave me attitude for treating her girlfriend like garbage when I don't know what she's going through (eye roll). \n\nMy husband also thinks that while she was definitely out of line with that, she was probably only acting out cause of pregnancy hormones and that I could've handled the situation better without straight up threatening to leave her homeless.

Pregnancy hormones is not a excuse to being a shitty person. \n\nIf she was a responsible person she should be extremely grateful that you two gave her a roof and your support and she should be trying to help around the house to do her part. If she flipped a few times, but was respectful most of the time, then yes that could be pregnancy hormones. But doing nothing all day and always an asshole is just her personality.", "NTA. You need to sit with both of them and establish serious bounderies and rules: if they wanna your help, house, food,  money, medical help, etc etc etc they have to respect you and help arround the house. You dont run an hotel, and specially you are not their slave, which they can use and abuse and trash talk.\n\nThe girl was WAY out of line! She would be in a short line for the next few months.

Unless all this has happened in the last week and she's still in shock, which I don't think is the case.\n\nSince she and your son are keeping the baby, they're going to have to grow up fast. Part of growing up is taking responsibility for yourself and being thankful for the people in your life who are helping you. \n\nYou all need to sit down and have an honest, blunt, and kind discussion about the future: finances, responsibilities, expectations, etc. They need to understand that you and your husband are what's between them and a very difficult life they are probably ill-prepared for. They need to step up and start behaving like adults, not children (though kudos to your son for starting employment).\n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nIf she's going to insult you out of the blue like that, she needs to be able to take some shit in return.

Is he going to get an apartment for them both to live in?  Or would he prefer they both be allowed to live with you and act respectfully.  I get it, she's probably terrified, but you're doing her a huge huge favor and there's no reason to be throwing insults at you.", "Pregnancy hormones? How does this equate to an outright insult? Future grandchild. Sit back in your good place and imagine this \u201cfuture\u201d. Letting your heart dictate your everyday is poison to your well being in this case. I will not suggest what to do here, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s choice what they wish to endure. I have been down this road with toxic people and it is not pretty. Save this post, I guarantee your son will turn on you, disown you, say the most vile things you never expected. One day he may realize, for now, you have entered in to a situation that will ruin your happiness through no fault of your own.", "She and (perhaps to some extent) your son are emotionally dysfunctional. Unfortunately, you and your husband will have to do the heavy lifting and have to establish clear boundaries so that you can find peace in your own home. It might be appropriate to talk to them about family counseling and parenting so they start to understand their new SHARED responsibilities, especially his pregnant girlfriend. As you know, once the baby arrives the dynamics in that household will be amplified. Perhaps give them a timeline, say (just as an example) you\u2019re happy to support them until the baby is 1 years old given they respect rules x, y, and z and that you\u2019ll help support them in their journey to independence. It might give them incentive to show more gratitude and take responsibility for their decisions\u2026.

You should all sit down together and set some rules and boundaries with her. Make it clear that if she is not going to get a job, then she needs to be prepared to do regular chores.  Additionally, she needs to be more respectful to her. She was way out of line on Sunday, and continued disrespect will result in her having to move out. Be calm but clear on the requirements for her to be allowed to stay in your home. Pregnancy is NO excuse for laziness or rudeness.", "NTA\n\nand I would tell my son if he wants to have an attitude about it he can go with her.", "NTA. Pregnancy hormones are not a reason to be shitty and your husband was wrong for even suggesting that. If she can\u2019t respect you, she needs to leave.", "NTA.\n\nYou all need to sit down and lay out some ground rules. Your son and his girlfriend also need to make a solid plan in terms of pulling their weight in the household as well as planning for the future. Respect is key here. You didn't have to open your home to her. If she can't respect you in your home, then she needs to find somewhere else to go.", "NTA. Time to sit some actual boundaries and enforce them. Look into shelters for teen moms so you can explain their options.", "NTA. You seriously need to have them find their own place. Her disrespect is far beyond hormones.

Stop babying your son.", "NTA. You\u2019re providing her with a roof and food, not charging her rent AND PAYING FOR AL HER MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS. The least she can do is be respectful. \n\nI\u2019d suggest talking with your husband first about boundaries and then both of you sit down with your son and explain to him the meaning of RESPECT and let him know of your boundaries in YOUR home. Once he understands then invite the gf to sit down and talk to her (I say talk to the son first because that way he\u2019ll get all the yelling and arguments out without the gf chiming in instead of just not listening and blindly defending his gf\u2019s attitude)\n\nYes, she\u2019s pregnant.

This will be her MO going forward.  Your son will be working lots of hours (at maybe lots of jobs) to make her happy.  She will likely even expect you to help her baby financially.  She is a manipulator with her crocodile tears.\n\nGuessing since you have a son that you know what it's like to be pregnant.  And the cry of \"pregnancy hormones\" is ridiculous.  It may be an explanation for her bad behavior but it is NOT an excuse for it.  One is still expected to act like a civilized person while pregnant!", "NTA, but empty threats aren't going to help. Kick them out, or at least tell them that you are going to at the end of the month. THEN, tell them you will change your mind if all of you can agree on some ground rules, like your son paying rent if he doesn't, his gf helping with specific tasks that you all decide on, and rules about common decency and respect.\n\nAnd if you aren't charging him rent and had no intention of doing so, please think about starting. It would benefit him to have to budget for rent, and when he's ready to move out, you can give him whatever he pays you as an instant nest egg.

They can say whatever they want but they best be ready. You wouldn\u2019t dare let someone say that type of shit to me and just let it go. Ain\u2019t no way. Son better fall in line or both need to move out. I\u2019ve been pregnant and had 4 kids. Pregnancy is not an excuse to be an asshole.", "NTA, you need to talk to your son about his responsibility. If he expects you to pay for everything while she sits on her butt and is disrespectful, they may need a life lesson in entitlement and being self sufficient.", "NTA being pregnant doesn't make you rude, disrespectful,  lazy, or a b**ch.  \n\nThis is just who she is and now your son is going to gave to deal with her for at least 18 years", "NTA. Das Boot! It might also teach your son a lesson. You can always let them come back when they agree to your rules, chores list, etc. Just remind them that they are 18, \"adults\", they can act like it or learn it the hard way on their own.\n\nAnd all your dear whiny redditors, you can grow up also, take responsibility for your actions.", "NTA.

If you live in this house (I assume for free) you will either be working (until dr ordered not to) or in school. \n\n2. All members of the household are required to help with chores, set up a chore chart, let people tell you they hate cooking but will do the laundry etc\u2026 But chores for everyone. \n\nThat not complying will result in a 30 day eviction notice. \n\nI\u2019m not surprised that parents who just throw out a pregnant child also didn\u2019t provide the kind of parenting that taught their kids to be a responsible adult, but unless you want this to become a shitshow you guys either need solid roles and boundaries to help them both keep becoming adults or you need to step back and help them some other way.

Always offer your son a chance to come home, but with expectations that his GF will not be unemployed. \n\nYou're better than me, I would push adoption or kick them out at the news. There's a reason her parents did and they know what kind of person she is.", "INFO: how far along is she? Whilst I think you\u2019re NTA for demanding respect in your own home and that her behaviour is out of order; please be mindful of giving her more physical chores during the third trimester. You can be sick and in pain even in a low risk pregnancy, she probably does need to rest. Perhaps your son could take on some more chores on her behalf?", "Being a little more emotional while pregnant is normal.\n\nBeing an AH not.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBUT they both are still learning how to adult.  Choosing to not wear a condom was your son's choice, and she apparently had no form of bc going either.\n\nIt is what it is now, you and your husband opened your doors for them.

It is far easier to tackle this kind of situation if you put emotions to the side and lay things out in black and white. She's not working, fine.

Dunno if ether of them realize that they need to be careful to prevent other future pregnancies so they can at least give themselves the best shot at getting stability for this child.

It was obviously an unplanned pregnancy and it resulted in my son's girlfriend getting kicked out of her house by her mom. I never liked this girl, but I obviously couldn't let her on the streets now that she's carrying my grandchild, so I let her live in our house. Now both she and my son gave up on college for the near future and my son is now working a full time job so he can provide for them in the future.\n\nThe problem is that his girlfriend refuses to do anything, but absolutely anything all day, she just locks herself up in my son's room eating snacks and watching videos on (my son's) computer. I need to drag her out to just help me with cooking and to clean up at least the room she's staying, but she's always b\\*tching about how I'm working her like a slave even tho she's already in constant pain cause of her pregnancy and then she'll come crying to my son about my treatment of her. Mind you, she doesn't have a high risk pregnancy (I know that cause me and my husband are the ones fully paying for her medical controls) and I don't put her up to do tasks like cleaning the toilet or anything similar.\n\nHowever she really crossed the line when after I got dressed up she asked me where I was going and when I told her that I'm getting ready for church, her exact response was: \"I didn't know there were churches that were allowing people looking like striptease dancers in\". At that point I absolutely had it with her and I told her straight that I don't care who tf she is, I won't allow her to disrespect me while living in my house and if she can't keep her attitude in check then she can get tf out of my home. She pretty much started crying at that point and immediately called my son, who later on also gave me attitude for treating her girlfriend like garbage when I don't know what she's going through (eye roll). \n\nMy husband also thinks that while she was definitely out of line with that, she was probably only acting out cause of pregnancy hormones and that I could've handled the situation better without straight up threatening to leave her homeless. AITA ?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This might get him to make her start doing things rather than you looking like the bad guy and having to deal with her.", "My step sister got pregnant unexpectedly and she wasn't quite sure who the father was...this made.my step mom super pissed and even though for the first year of my step nieces life she was allowed to live at my step moms house my step mom made sure she she did everything as if she was a single mother. She had her apply for WIC, she wrote up a lease for her to rent her house (step mom lived with Dad but still owned the house she lived in before their relationship), step sister had to stop working her job in the scantily clad women dancer field and step mom forced her to get a professional hourly job. She drug tested her every week and a bunch more stuff I don't remember. \n\nI never really like my step mom or sister but that was one thing I actually approved of her doing because step sister moved out at 16 and had a lot of issues and now that it's 8 or 9 years later (from the pregnancy not her moving out)  step sis is actually a responsible adult and mother which definitely wouldn't have happened if they just let her lay around jobless and not accepting the consequences of her actions. I know consequences sounds bad when referring to kids but if you're gonna have sex without protection what the hell do you think will happen? A rainbow shooting out of your vagina in 9 months.\n\nIdk, I'm a huge supporter of its 2023 with all the birth control options available now a days how is anyone getting pregnant.
