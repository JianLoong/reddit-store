{"id": 5903, "submission_id": "zxquj7", "title": "AITA for asking my husband to return the gift he bought me?", "selftext": " \n\nHusband and I have been together for 18 years. At the start, he asked me what kind of gifts do I enjoy getting? Before I could even answer, he said I bet you like jewelry. All women like jewelry. I was nice but corrected him, saying that no, not all women like jewelry, especially not me. I told him I very rarely wear it, and when I do I\u2019m quite picky about what I wear. I told him I really hated yellow gold. I asked him not to buy me jewelry.\n\nFirst gift: a bunch of small silver earrings. I thanked him, but reminded him that jewelry wasn\u2019t my thing. 1st anniversary: I got 1 ct diamond studs in yellow gold. We fight. He calls me ungrateful. I say he\u2019s not listening to me. Store wouldn\u2019t allow me to return them, only allowing store credit. I compromised, telling him I would wear them occasionally if I could put the stones in a white gold setting. He agreed. For years, I thought I was probably the AH for not being grateful. Years pass & more jewelry gifts. I return what I can. A ridiculously expensive diamond tennis bracelet. Another argument. Another expensive necklace after I made the mistake of saying it was pretty. I didn\u2019t make a fuss, just thanked him and put it away. I figured out that he gives me jewelry cuz he wants me to wear it. I said I understood this was the reason he did it, but again told him that I won't wear jewelry and asked him to please stop. Xmas morning: There is a jewelry store logo bag on the counter. I ask him if he just bought me more jewelry that he knows I hate. He gives me that smarmy smile that kids put on when they know they\u2019ve done fucked up. I say No! Not funny. Why the fuck would you buy me jewelry again when you know I hate it? First he says he forgot. Then he says cuz it was simple. It\u2019s a yellow gold diamond & emerald necklace. I say several times stop buying me jewelry & I hate jewelry. I give him the bag & say take it back, please. He is pissed.\n\nThe next day I try to talk to him about it, but he says I am ungrateful. He says his aunt hated chocolate, but when she was given chocolates, she was gracious. I said yep cuz the person giving her the chocolates had good intentions and just didn\u2019t know that she didn\u2019t like chocolates. Husband knows very well I don\u2019t like jewelry and continues to insist upon giving it to me cuz it\u2019s what HE wants. I tell him he is disrespecting me cuz he isn\u2019t bothering to get me anything I actually like. He says, nope, I\u2019m disrespecting him by demanding that he return the necklace. I ask what would he do if I continually bought pink shirts for him cuz I want him to wear them? He HATES pink. He says that he would thank me & accept them graciously. He would not wear them, no matter how much I wanted him to. He has always been gracious about whatever he has received. He also told me I am being hurtful. I might be the AH cuz he is right, I'm not being grateful.\n\nTLDR; Husband repeatedly gifts me jewelry despite knowing I hate it.", "created_utc": 1672275377, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxquj7/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_return_the_gift_he/", "score": 418, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would thank him for it, and I would have it out being used in a few days.  \n\nI am sorry he is like this.  He thinks it is funny, but he has told you with every year that you don't matter.  You do matter.  Take care of yourself.", "\"This is my husband.  Here is his photo and full name.

The perfect gift delights because it's something that person truly loves.\n\nYour husband hasn't been giving you gifts. In fact, he's showing how little he cares by repeatedly buying you things you dislike after being asked not to. This jewelry is about him and what he wants, not you\u2014hence, not really gifts.\n\nYou should make it clear to him that his repeated disregard for your preferences\u2014which he should damn well know after 18 years\u2014is disrespectful. Hurtful, even. That there's no excuse for continuing to do this. He needs to confront whatever the real reason for this behavior is, because it isn't trying to make you happy.", "Your husband is soooooooooooo stupid.

Who wastes that much money on stuff that is just going to collect dust? Is he frivolous with money in general? He is wasting so much money to...mess with you? Show you that your feelings don't matter? To wear you down until you give in and start wearing it? Your husband is weird af. NTA OP, start selling it all", "NTA dudes enjoying his weird power trip. this is actually manipulative and due to how long its been going on and the intent behind it, could be classed as emotional abuse. he's buying u expensive beautiful stuff knowing u hate it and knowing you'll come across as the bad guy to anyone he talks about it with cos hes spending lots of money and u dont like it. most ppl wld side w him and say \"he obviously loves you otherwise he wouldn't spend so much money\" but its the opposite. this dude loves upsetting you/winding you up.", "NTA. It sounds like it is time for some petty revenge. Every single gift you give from now on should be something you know he hates. Fake annoyance when he doesn\u2019t like it and tell him he should be gracious and grateful. Nothing like a taste of your own medicine.", "NTA", "NTA. Buy him the pink shirts from now on.", "Nta guess your future gift buying experiences are going to be super simple\u2026 Just thinking, maybe I should open a pink shirt store?", "He does not respect you. \n\nGood luck on your divorce!", "Completely NTA. If he was buying jewelry because he enjoyed seeing you in it, he would of told you this and worked with you on pieces you would be okay wearing for his enjoyment. The fact they are large pieces, and especially in types you have expressly stated you hate, states he is doing this for his ego and he has no care for you. Stop wasting your energy returning them. and honestly stop wasting your energy arguing with him. He knows what you are telling him, he is simply not caring. I would be petty and start doing what he has been saying; accept the gift graciously....then throw it in the bottom corner of a closet, regift it to someone in your life that you know would actually enjoy the piece, sell it. It's a gift, the item is now yours to do with what you want (even if it's just ignore it's very existence).", "NTA. I can\u2019t stand yellow gold either.", "NTA\n\nHe might accept the first one and thank you.\n\n\n But trust me after being gifted a pink shirt he would never wear on his birthday/easter/christmas/whatever for the third time in a row he would be pissed. \n\n\nHe is just saying that so you will stop and shut up and he can continue to buy you gifts you don't want cause it is easy.", "NTA. I had a guy who used to do this to me. I think if made him feel good, like a man, to get me stereotypical gifts that he viewed as what women wanting, regardless of me telling him it\u2019s not me", "NTA. You do realise he doesn\u2019t see you as an individual right? He treats you as nothing more than a false stereotype. He doesn\u2019t care about you, he just wants you to be the stereotype good little submissive wife who gets on her knees and thank him for anything he gives you.\n\nWhy did you marry him? Could you not see this?", "18 years of unwanted jewelry could probably pay for a nice divorce lawyer and maybe a boat.", "Just rewrap your presents and give them back to him. NTA", "Sell the jewelry and buy what you want with it. \n\nAnd don't bother buying him pink stuff. Why waste more money? Just stop buying him anything. Get him a gift card. It's thoughtless and easy and it's basically what he's giving you. NTA.", "NAH but gifts should be accepted with grace. Maybe the jewelry is symbolic of a time when he\u2019s not around and you can use it to pay for the mortgage, bills, food, funeral expenses? I was told this was a reason to buy jewelry.", "No regift the jewellery", "\u2026or a divorce.", "Yup. Never buy him ANYTHING again but  Pink stuff . \n\nEverytime a milestone come ask him what he wants as a gift; then spend time hyping him up saying you have a surprise for him, then have it be a Pink shirt. \n\nCook him pink shirts for dinner. Buy him pink shades when he has a promotion. Covers your bed in Pink sheets. Make him watch the Pink panther all day long. If you ever make a cake dye it Pink. \n\nPut so much Pink in his life that he. throws. it. up.\n\nu/Amenable2Mischief", "No it's NOT too expensive to give to a friend.

Made a list perhaps?", "Lol. This got me almost spit out my coffee", "Yeah, but he's breaking his vows by not honouring or cherishing you.

She hates roses, the look, the smell, everything, and she never hid that fact. But what did he always bring home for her? Roses that she couldn't even stand to be in the same room with.
