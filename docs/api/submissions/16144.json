I had no way to contact him. He was finally sober. My parents allowed us to develop a relationship. We grew very close and while I didn\u2019t call him \u201cdad\u201d I loved him very much. Sadly, a year later, he relapsed and overdosed. It devastated me not just to lose him, but also what we could\u2019ve had if he had remained sober. I eventually got into therapy to help with everything.\n\nNow, I\u2019m married and expecting my first child. My parents have been amazing and supportive, my dad walked me down the aisle at my wedding. They are so excited to be grandparents.\n\nMy husband and I recently found out we\u2019re having a boy. We\u2019ve decided to name him after my biological father, to honor his memory. He wasn\u2019t a bad guy. He was just mentally ill (had ptsd) and struggled a lot in life. He loved me enough to know I deserved better and let my dad adopt me. I had an amazing life because he was selfless and self aware enough. \n\nI told my parents and they did not take it well. My dad was quiet and just obviously sad. My mom asked how I could name my child after the man who abandoned me. She said I don\u2019t have to name my child after my adoptive father, but she\u2019s going to struggle with calling her grandchild by the name of the man who \u201ccouldn\u2019t clean up his act\u201d and then \u201ctraumatized her daughter\u201d (I found him). She and my dad left shortly later. My mom isn\u2019t speaking to me. My dad said it\u2019s ultimately my choice and he\u2019ll respect it, but it does hurt.\n\nEDIT: This name does not work as a middle name. And my bio dad didn\u2019t have a middle name. \n\nI feel so conflicted. I don\u2019t want to dredge up bad memories for my mom or make my dad uncomfortable. But my bio dad means a great deal to me.

Addiction is a mental illness, but it is 100% fair for people who are hurt by addiction to be angry or hurt at the person who hurt them. Your bio dad hurt your mom. He hurt you whether you see it that way or not. Doesn\u2019t mean he was a bad person but it does mean that his legacy is more negative than positive.

There are so many solutions to that, including acknowledging that \u201cflow\u201d is subjective and it\u2019s need arbitrary. \n\nUse the names you want because there is meaning behind them. Use nicknames or variations if you don\u2019t feel comfortable using the name for whatever reason. Use a name that your biological father found important or meaningful. You got to know him sober.

It\u2019s great you moved passed what your dad has done, however I think you see him threw rose colored glasses. I think you have made him into some hero for putting you first. Which yes it was probably the most non selfish thing he has ever done. I also think you might feel differently about bio dad once your little one is in your arms. You may know exactly what your mom means about paying tribute to the man that hurt your child once your little one is here. \n\nBut do you know what real courage is being the father you don\u2019t have to be. Being the father that sits up with a sick kid when they didn\u2019t have to. Being the father that gives a child he doesn\u2019t owe anything to everything.\n\nI am not saying you have to name your child after your adoptive dad. But letting you know that your adoptive dad was the man that showed up. Every single day.\n\nPlus also something else to think about.

By naming your child after your biological father you are honoring a person that deeply wounded your mother.

I can see all the thoughts about the \"what ifs\" and idealisation of him, but you are an adult making a choice that will have life-long repercussions.\n\nYou just have to think about two facts:\n\n1) it will change your relationship with the two parents who WERE there and cared for you and love you in a way that it might never be recovered. You see your bio-father as someone who did his best, although he failed badly. Your mother sees him as someone who hurt his daughter (I bet you asked her where your bio-father was and if he didn't love you enough to be there), and who abandoned you and her while she struggled to raise you. Your dad is hurt by how much you glorify someone who wasn't there, while everything he did was just not good enough. \n\n2) Your child is going to grow up.

They don\u2019t really seem to deserve that hurt, so you\u2019d probably have to accept it and not push those boundaries if they do retract.

There is a whole mother load of sacrifice right there all along, but you can\u2019t see it because you are blinded by the beautiful moments you spent with biological father. I\u2019m not denying that he could have been a wonderful father, but the key word is could have been vs IS. \n\nNobody is the AH here, everyone is processing the situation differently. I\u2019m even sure your mother would talk to you eventually even as you stay firm in naming your child after your late biological father but is it all worth it? I don\u2019t think your biology father would even want this if if he really is the sacrificial man you paint him to be. A birth of a child is a wonderful thing. Why mar the memory of the event? So much rift was unnecessarily created at her birth. What should have a joyful family time is now forever ruined with members of the family not talking to each other. I cannot help but liken this situation to a person who throws his or her\u2019s faithful spouse for a shiny young thing. I know it\u2019s not the same but I feel this is closest I can come to help you understand what you\u2019re doing. But still, you\u2019re NTA. It\u2019s really your choice. You have made a decision based on emotions rather than logic and understanding.\n\nI just feel so so bad for your adoptive father. All the years of sacrifice and bring with his family, this has been his ultimate reward. Maybe blood is thicker than water. I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m really hurting for your adoptive dad. All these feels like misplaced loyalty. If you don\u2019t mind me advising you this, name your child something else. You can call the child with your preferred name when at home. But anyway, congratulations on the birth of your baby and being a mom!", "YTA. \n\nYour mom and stepdad have a negative, loaded relationship with your bio dad.

She treated him different, she started acting differently around us as parents (he was our second child). She kept bringing up all her late husband's faults and telling us to look out for them...we are NC now. \n\nOf course this is just our experience (and my MIL was by no means stable to begin with).

Stop feeling guilty because you love your adoptive dad and you realize your bio-dad couldn't compare.  It's okay to be mad at your bio-dad because he wasn't around.  It's easy to be fun when you did no hard work and just get to reap the rewards of someone else's hard work of parenting which is what he did.  Not saying he didn't have some good points, but it sounds like you just wish he had been different so bad that you're idolizing him too much.  He could have been sober but in many ways, he chose not too.  He chose drugs over you.  At some point an addict hopefully chooses to make that first step to sobriety and hopefully stay that way.  Your dad did not make that choice.  Do you really want to name your child after someone that could hurt so many people that he was supposed to love.  Giving your child his name so he can live the life your bio-dad couldn't is not the legacy worth giving to someone you are supposed to love more than anything.

For me, it's not necessarily meant to honor that person, but more of a way of keeping their memory alive throughout generations. I just wonder if, in your case, this is more a function of unresolved grief - which does not invalidate it by any means! And anyways, is grief ever completely resolved?

Him having one thing from your bio dad doesn\u2019t take away from that imo. \n\nAlso addiction is a horrible disease and the things people are saying about him without knowing anything other than the couple of vague details you gave make me sad.

If you tell him from a young age where his name came from and your mother/father/partner tell him the truth, it\u2019ll mess him up. Really, just make sure you know what you\u2019re doing.

If anything, that brief window of sobriety is the small aspect of him. \n\nBecause while there was undoubtedly more to him than his addiction at one point, that's not the man OP had the chance to ever know.\n\nAnd while on paper, it's easy to say addiction is just like any other disease, the reality is often infinitely more complicated. Children don't grow up thinking \"Daddy loves cancer more than me\" like they do with drugs. And they're not entirely wrong to feel that.\n\nMaybe he was a good or more complicated person inside. But what he was externally mattered too.\nAs much as addiction is a disease, that doesn't erase or excuse the abuse, neglect, or pain addicts cause their loved ones because of it. Addicts do prioritize addiction over relationships and OP's father did too, not only with OP but with her mother who he also abandoned.\n\n While OP's done whatever work they have to try and reconcile the fact their father couldn't be there more than minimally, their mother and the father who was present in her life are absolutely not wrong to not look past that so easily and I can definitely see how naming the child after a hypothetical biological father who never manifested could be a weird kind of slap in the face.", "You are absolutely right that addicts are not just their disease. There\u2019s so much more to them than their demons.

The lies & deception, draining of financial resources, broken trust, and watching them wither away from who they once were is incredibly difficult. Unlike cancer, addiction is a family disease. The vast majority of people who have loved and supported an addict have trauma as a result. That\u2019s just the reality. It\u2019s also why \u201cmaking amends\u201d is a cornerstone of NA and AA. \n\nOP was a child when her father passed and I would assume that because he was such a role model to OP, her mother never told her about the trauma he caused her mother. \n\nI get what you\u2019re saying, but I think in reality it\u2019s a bit naive. There is a 0% this kid wouldn\u2019t realize the way his grandparents or the rest of the family looks at him.

If a loved one had a type of cancer or degenerative illness that led them to lie, cheat, steal, and consistently hurt the people trying to care for them, all while scheming constantly to make themselves sicker, I would understand that using their namesake to honour their struggle would also be a slap in the face for the people who had done that thankless caring.  \n\nUnderstanding addiction as a disease rather than a moral failing is an important aspect of helping people to get effective treatment rather than writing them off. But it's really not the same as other illnesses in terms of how those who are suffering from it make those around them suffer too.", "This.

I\u2019ll also add that I named my daughter  after my father who raised me. \n\nThe reality is you\u2019re romanticizing a very limited time with a person that had great struggles. You had him for 1 year out of the 30 that your actual father had dedicated to you with zero relation. That very limited time you had with him was also during an incredibly vulnerable time as a young girl. \n\nI\u2019m sure he was very good to you during the time you knew him.

I could not even comprehend the level of pain that my father would have been in had I named my daughter after my mother. My mom has had times of being wonderful, but my father spent years being the bad guy to protect me from her addiction.

Also names are incredibly loaded things, giving your child the name of someone who meant so much to you is going to add layers of complication to that relationship you probably don't need. I would gently suggest you chat with your therapist and explore this issue to decide if it's something you really want to do. \n\nAlso try to see this from your mums pov. She *did* get clean. That was almost definitely incredibly hard for her. She likely gave up and went through a lot in order to be better for you. I'm sure like most parents she wouldn't change that for the world, but to honor someone who wouldn't make that choice when she *did* make it, and then spent years dealing with the fallout of his inability too probably feels like a huge slap in the face. Not to mention having seen you be hurt by his actions will also have caused her pain because she loves you and there's nothing worse as a parent than watching your child suffer and not being able to help. \n\nI think there are a multitude of good reasons _not_ to do this, and you obviously think there are lots of good reasons to do it.

There was a whole lot of hurt and bad situations that happened between us while dealing with his addictions. He cleaned up his act around  the time my son was 5, and we co parent well now.\n It would, however, be a lot to deal with still if my child named our grandson after him - someone who I left to give them a better life and who caused me and my child so much pain. I had to pick up the pieces for my child every time he made a mistake or couldn't be around.

She was an addict too, ya know. Do you think it was easy for your mom to give up her life of partying and fun to be a mom before she was apparently ready? I can tell you with certainty that it was not. But she did, for you. She also has a disease. She was also sick. She put in the work. I'm sure it's impossible for you to imagine how hard it must be to beat addiction, have a baby, and also raise that baby alone for the first several months (while battling addiction). \n\nIn those lonely moments, when you wouldn't stop screaming no matter what she did, on 3 hours of sleep, with nobody there to help her, that is probably when she had the most urges to use. Some addict mothers dump their babies in a dumpster. Some leave them at the hospital. Some keep them, but make them live in squalor or sell their bodies for drug money. \n\nYour dad took the easy path. He may have been telling himself at the time \"I am going to stay away from my daughter because I'm no good for her\". But really, that was his addiction justifying his further drug use. Framing himself as the good guy who did the hard but right thing for your sake was a deflection and justification. Your mom went with it because it would have been abusive and wrong to tell you at a young tender age \"your bio dad took the easy road and decided to keep being an addict rather than put in the lifelong effort to get it together to be present in your life\". But that's the reality. It wasn't any easier for your mom to get clean than it would have been for your dad. Your mom prioritized you, he did not. It's that simple. \n\nAnd how convenient for your father to come back into your life when you were a teenager. By then, you didn't need to depend on him to stay alive. He still didn't have to be a full on dad. He didn't have to wipe your butt or cook your dinner. It also seems like he didn't take the time being clean he should have taken before he reached out to you, considering he overdosed only a year later. This might hurt when I say this, but he reached out to you for HIM. It sounds like you were his step 4 in the NA program. He got to the point in his recovery where he needed to make amends. Also, his addiction likely made him selfishly want to make things right with you. Like, he didn't reach out for you. He reached out for him. To console his own guilty conscience. And have you considered that he may not have died on his relapse? It's likely that he was using already when he overdosed. It's likely that he was high when he was with you, and that he was lying to you about being clean, at least for a time.\n\nI think you think you've healed or gotten closure, but I think you've created a fantasy. It's likely been a defense mechanism, and I am not judging you for it, but there's still a lot of reality that you aren't seeing. And man, your mom and adopted dad must love you so much and be so selfless. They know the things I've just told you, but they don't want to tell you. They seem to understand that you, like, need this fantasy of your bio dad. \n\nI think you'd be insulting yourself if you name this child for your bio dad. I'm sure he loved you somewhere deep inside, but it's clear he loved drugs much more, and took the easy road every single time rather than be there for you, even in the end, even when he reached out to you. I'm kinda irritated that he reached out, because he probably knew how risky it was and how likely it was that he would relapse at least a couple of times before he was able to stay clean for any substantial amount of time. His sponsor and people in NA and his support group probably were not encouraging him reaching out to his teenage daughter that he never had a relationship with so soon in his sobriety either. At the end of the day, he got the closure and validation he needed. He got to go out convincing himself that \"he did the right thing by you\" and \"at least he made things right\" and he got validation and love from someone he never deserved it from, at your expense. \n\nEverything he did from the moment you existed was AT YOUR EXPENSE and for HIS BENEFIT.

But keep in mind, you're doing it knowing that it's going to hurt the two people that have always been there for you, loved you unconditionally and put you first.

So, I'm going to say yes, I think YTA. Just because you can do something, doesn't mean it's not a crappy thing to do.", "I would seriously consider telling your mom and dad you're off your rocker due to hormones or something and apologize for even bringing it up.

It was the first time he was ever violent and luckily I was able to get out of the house before he was able to hit me. I left the state. I left all contact open so he couldn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t give him the chance to contact me and ask to see his kid. He just never tried. I even left him multiple texts letting him know what state I was moving to, when my due date was, and telling him that he could feel free to involve the courts if he wanted to see his kid. Because I was determined to strip his rights the right way so I could protect my kid. Now, we are to the point where if he does try, I can get him with child abandonment charges since contact has been open but he hasn\u2019t bothered to reach out. And if my daughter reconnects with him, after she\u2019s old enough to know what he did, and if she named a child after that awful man, I would be beyond livid.

It crushed us all and I ended up naming my son completely after him (I chose a different first name, but used my brothers first and middle name as my sons two middle names and then gave him my brothers last name, though while it sounds weird, he had our moms maiden name). Grief, mixed with already jacked up pregnancy hormones, do not mix well, especially when so close to the due date.\n\nNow that I\u2019m married, my son is for all intents and purposes my husbands son (his birth father dipped early in my pregnancy and my husband came into the picture when he was 1). We plan on changing his last name to ours, as well as my husband adopting him. I think this will help with the guilt I\u2019ve developed over essentially taking away his OWN identity. His uncle was NOT a bad man by any means. When he was clean he was so much fun to be around, literally had everyone always laughing and smiling. We were very close and he was so excited to have another nephew. But what you said terrifies me. I don\u2019t want him to grow up thinking he\u2019ll end up going down the wrong path as my brother or that he has a time limit.", "He abandoned her mother and her....\n\n\nMy mother died of cancer ans begged the doctors to try to keep her alive to see me graduate. She didn't make it.\n\nThe difference is my mom was at every recital every play every tummyache every broken heart. Had I had a daughter I would have given her my moms name as a middle name because my mom showed me unconditional love and made me the mother I am today. That's how it's freaking different.", "Same here. Got my grandmoms whole name.She had a heart attack at 45 and here I am thinking every other day I'm having a damn heart attack.AND to make it even worse I look exactly like my mom. And everyone in my family calls me HER name\ud83d\ude29", "Are you my brother? Lol", "Just because it'd a disease doesn't mean people have to accept being treated like trash for it. Lol what?", "This lol this right here. Albus severus good lord.", "Exactly this. Naming the baby after bio dad looks like a huge FU to the adoptive dad.", "This suddenly made me think of someone I know in a similar situation (didnt realize some of his kids weren't his bio kids for years until he mentioned something about bio dad in passing and we were all surprised). I had a step family that never really blended together (parents were dating when I was 5 and married when I was 8, still don't consider stepmom my mom, etc) but when I put him and his family in this scenario, yeah that'd be a huge slap to his face if any of his non-bio kids did something like that to him. He and his wife try to keep the negative stuff (related to bio dad) away from the kids and speak positively about it, but yeah if they picked the deadbeat dad they've seen a handful of times in their lives over him, ouch.", "I want to upvote this to support you, but also downvote this because what your dad did was wrong. I\u2019m sorry you are dealing with this.", "Maybe \ud83d\udc40", "And the OP is definitely YTA.", "very often there are shadows that we may be not aware of but cause a lot of pain for one or more family members", "Op, I am just going to say this and I am sorry this may hurt. Your dad was not being selfless by letting your step-dad adopt you. Nor did he care enough about you to let you have a better life. Having PTSD is an explanation for why he had addiction problems but addicts are inherently selfish. He wasn't allowing you to have a better life. By letting you Step dad adopt you, he was choosing his addiction above you. Your mom's reaction to naming your baby after your bio dad, tells me that she fought a long and difficult battle for him to choose you above his addiction and she tried to spare you the pain and heartache of feeling abandoned by him.", "By your own admission, you only really knew your bio dad for a year. It sounds like you're more enamored with the idea of him than the man himself. Are you really willing to alienate the people closest to you, and potentially alienate them from your child, for this idea?", "Ok I\u2019m a big believer in it being your choice to name your child, you\u2019re the one that\u2019s carried it for 9 months but in this specific case YTA. It\u2019s a bit of a slap in the face for your adopted Dad and a name that is possibly quite triggering for your Mum. While it\u2019s nice you see your bio Dad the way you do and recognise he wasn\u2019t well, he still made choices that kept him away from you. Your Mum chose to get clean for you, your bio Dad didn\u2019t. Your adopted Dad chose to raise you like his own, your bio Dad didn\u2019t. Maybe you see your bio Dad through rose tinted spectacles and when someone has passed we tend to focus on their good points and forget the flaws. Please reconsider for the people that raised you.", "YTA - Children should not be memorials. They should just be allowed to become their own people. \n\nYou are already giving the kid a poor start in naming him in a way that will mean that his relatives will look at him and remember someone else, and not necessarily remember them in a good way. Remember the relationship you had with your dad was not the same experience others had with him and he may very well have behaved badly towards them, addicts are often not nice people when in the midst of addiction.\n\nGive your child his own identity.", "> You have every right to name your child whatever you want\n\nNo you don't. that's a real, human person you're naming. not a pet and not a rock.", "I cannot believe how people treat those with addiction struggles.\nIt's incredibly nice of the bio father to realise he would be a bad role model & wouldn't be the best father. Rather then putting her through 13yrs or traumatic experiences, he chose to leave. \nThis hits home because as an ex addict I know how hard it is & how it takes over your entire life. I would never want to burden anyone with my previous addiction but I did. I didn't have the foresight to realise what my actions were doing & what  memories I was leaving, now I am only judged based on the person I was... Rather then the person I'm becoming. Which I understand, but it really shows what type of person you are when your the one doing the judging rather than understanding.\nWhen drugs are involved, you are basically dealing with 2 different people and addicts RARELY do what this father did. They normally stick around and ruin almost everything, given the circumstances he did the absolute best thing possible!\nI wish more people realised addiction is a disorder & should be treated as such... Not everyone has money either, to be able to make things easier when quitting. \nOn top of quitting drugs, you still have everything in life to deal with & people just treat you worse because you were an addict, regardless of what you have or haven't done to them personally. Which, to put it in perspective. Would you treat someone like a down syndrome worse because of their condition? Or anyone else with mental disorders, what about anxiety, what about depression? Would you treat them as less than just because of that? \nAddicts choose to start it, but they can never go back in time and not do it so it's irreversible & that's something they have to live with forever.", "Yeah, this sums up my thoughts... Why name your child after someone with a hard legacy with many struggles and little happiness? Why associate your child with that? He deserves his own fresh start with no one's shadow before him.\n\nNAH", "This is also a great point. Like I understand the daddy issues and trauma that this girl was left with, but she's doing so much harm. As the kids like to say, it gives me the ickiest feeling. And my heart breaks for the stepdad.", "My ex wanted to name our child after his dad, who had a similar story to the OP's dad.  I wouldn't allow my child to have that burden. There are other ways to honor the memory of a parent.", "Borderline YTA for me. She's saddling her kid with a name with a huge emotional burden. She's disrespecting her mother's and step dad's feelings. But what tipped me off were her reasons for not even trying for a compromise. She can use her bio dad's name as a middle name or use another name that has a sentimental value to both of them or him. So many ways to go about this. This could be the result of grief and guilt over being the one finding her dad dead.", "Have you lived with an addict?  Love with one than labor it a simple health issue.  Tho isn\u2019t cancer, addiction normally makes the addict treat the family poorly.  OPs dad gave her up for 13 years, he is not a victim.", ">normally\n\nThat one word is doing a hell of a lot of heavy lifting, here.  So you're painting a whole group of people with the same illness all with one brush because of something *some of them* do.\n\n>OPs dad gave her up for 13 years\n\nOP's dad came to an agreement with her mom that it would be best for their daughter if he wasn't a part of her life until he was in recovery.  And it was probably the right decision.  And it was probably a difficult decision.\n\nAnd btw, I never said it was a *simple* health issue.", "My bio father absolutely chose drugs over my sister and I. Younger bro one he tried a little bit, but younger bro 2 he ACTUALLY stopped choosing drugs for. \n\nSure, addiction blah. \n\nBut he actively chose drugs over us, and proved later all it took was having a penis to gain \u201cdaddy\u2019s love and sobriety\u201d. \n\nSome people DO choose drugs over their kids. \n\nMy adoptive dad\u2019s ex wife did the same to my little bro from them. Literally stood in court and said she\u2019d rather have drugs than go to rehab and keep her parental rights.", "I think you have a great answer. People don\u2019t realize or name with malicious intent, or at least I would hope not, but regardless there is always some degree of a shadow left behind, especially if that person wasn\u2019t unanimously well liked. I can see both sides: OP doesn\u2019t view her farther in a bad light, and has an incredible amount of empathy for her bio dad. She also see\u2019s his absence as a blessing; she was able to have a better dad, her adoptive dad. She also got to see him work to get sober, so they could have a relationship. Most people can\u2019t see the selflessness in that. Sometimes people just know they will only hurt those around them. I can also see it from the mothers perspective: how can a father choose drugs over his own daughter, especially when she could. Sometimes people just aren\u2019t that strong. I think a lot of talking, and a compromise of the middle name would be the most reasonable outcome. Just my two cents.", "YTA: you are glorifying your fathers memory and excusing a lot of his behavior. Its clear that your mother has a different take on your fathers life than you do, and she is far more informed.", "Sorry but I don't understand why you'd do this and yes I'm going to say YTA. How do you think your son will feel being named after someone who abandoned you and then died from a drug overdose shortly after reuniting with you? Also you did not have an amazing life because he was selfless, you had an amazing life because of your mum and step-dad. It's a massive slap in the face to them and it's not fair on your son either. I really hope you reconsider.", "I\u2019m an adopted kid who has a great relationship with my birth mother and both my parents who adopted me. I cannot imagine naming my child after my birthmother because I know how much that would hurt my mom. What an awful thing to do to your dad. Sorry but YTA. Maybe I\u2019m just too emotionally invested because I\u2019m adopted, but yeah that\u2019s heartbreaking.", "How are you that ignorant? YTA", "Sorry but YTA. \nMy brother named his firstborn son after our dad. Our dad abused my mother, my sister, and me while growing up. My brother was the youngest and and only boy and was treated very differently by my dad and not subjected to the same abuse. When he told us what he would name his son, it hurt my sister and me tremendously. We begged him not to name his son that. He still did. And it still hurts that he would choose a name over the feelings of his close family members. \n\nYour mother was probably deeply traumatized and mistreated by this man. She was abandoned with a child. Luckily your stepfather stepped in and raised you. Naming your child after someone is the hugest honor you can give and this will probably feel like a huge slap in the face to both of them that will take a long time to get over.", "YTA. There\u2019s probably a lot he did to your mom that she NEVER told you about bc she\u2019s always put you first. My dad also did this to me, but I don\u2019t romanticize him. I lost years of my life grieving him bc of his egomaniacal drug addiction. He was also mentally ill but that\u2019s not an excuse for being a bad person. A bad person abandons their kids, lets an addiction become the only thing they live for, leaves his partner a single mom, which pray that isn\u2019t you bc that\u2019s no cake walk. Your mom has incredible fortitude. Can you imagine the trauma of what she endured with him, overcoming drug addiction, and the grief of a relationship ending even if it was a bad one, all before your first baby is born? Name your son after HER! Idc if her name is Rosemary! Make it work!", "She never once mentioned anything like taking her parents for granted, sad was in a bad situation same as mom, but mom was able to get out, dad wasn\u2019t, after years he tried to get sober and try to form a relationship. Addiction isn\u2019t easy to overcome dude.", "Yeah wtf lol one of my siblings and one of my parents go by their middle names.", "I\u2019ve literally always gone by my middle name", "Exactly. Choosing drugs over her would be him never getting help, and never reaching out to talk to her\n\nIt's shocking how quickly people believe a drug addiction recovery mixed with PTSD takes. Maybe he waited 13 years recovering so he was sure he was in the most ideal spot he could be to start a relationship with her", "My dad named me after his dead mom, he was constantly in and out of my life. Had an abusive step dad (he claimed to have an abusive dad) he did nothing about and he could barely look me in the eyes most of the time... guess I reminded him too much of the mom who left him so he had to leave me. \n\nI was a CNA like her and we enjoyed a lot of similar things according to my aunts because he'd never talk about his mother other than her dying of emphysema when he was young.", "Did you ask your father why they chose to give you grandfathers name if there was so much resentment? Just curious", "My partner and I used my Pa\u2019s middle name for our son\u2019s first name. It takes the stress away and still honours an incredible man."]}
