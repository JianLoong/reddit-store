She got sober and my bio dad tried but struggled. They decided before I was born that it would be best if he weren\u2019t around, at least until he cleaned up his act.\n\nWhen I was 6 months old, my mom met the man she\u2019d later marry and would also adopt me. He\u2019s really the only father figure I\u2019ve ever known. They never hid I was adopted but my adoptive father has treated me the same as my younger siblings. \n\nWhen I was 13, I got into contact with my bio dad. Edit to clarify: he reached out. I had no way to contact him. He was finally sober. My parents allowed us to develop a relationship. We grew very close and while I didn\u2019t call him \u201cdad\u201d I loved him very much. Sadly, a year later, he relapsed and overdosed. It devastated me not just to lose him, but also what we could\u2019ve had if he had remained sober. I eventually got into therapy to help with everything.\n\nNow, I\u2019m married and expecting my first child. My parents have been amazing and supportive, my dad walked me down the aisle at my wedding. They are so excited to be grandparents.\n\nMy husband and I recently found out we\u2019re having a boy. We\u2019ve decided to name him after my biological father, to honor his memory. He wasn\u2019t a bad guy. He was just mentally ill (had ptsd) and struggled a lot in life. He loved me enough to know I deserved better and let my dad adopt me. I had an amazing life because he was selfless and self aware enough. \n\nI told my parents and they did not take it well. My dad was quiet and just obviously sad. My mom asked how I could name my child after the man who abandoned me. She said I don\u2019t have to name my child after my adoptive father, but she\u2019s going to struggle with calling her grandchild by the name of the man who \u201ccouldn\u2019t clean up his act\u201d and then \u201ctraumatized her daughter\u201d (I found him). She and my dad left shortly later. My mom isn\u2019t speaking to me. My dad said it\u2019s ultimately my choice and he\u2019ll respect it, but it does hurt.\n\nEDIT: This name does not work as a middle name. And my bio dad didn\u2019t have a middle name. \n\nI feel so conflicted. I don\u2019t want to dredge up bad memories for my mom or make my dad uncomfortable. But my bio dad means a great deal to me.

There's thousands of names out there, and different ways to honor someone, so how could I do that so no one felt slighted or upset? Obviously if there's no way forward with a different name, hopefully your  mom and dad would come around, but as a parent, its your choice.  \n\nSo, ultimately that's just my opinion and you're free to do what you wish, but I don't see anyone being in the wrong here.", "Can you do middle name to recognize your bio dad and pick something else for the first name.", "\u201cThey decided before I was born that it would be best if he weren\u2019t around.\u201d\nI\u2019m sorry but this sounds like an extremely watered down version of \u201che was a drug addict who left his pregnant gf to get clean and raise a child on her own.\u201d This man was in your life for 1 year and left you with lifelong trauma. Of course you love him, he\u2019s your dad, but *of course* your mom doesn\u2019t have the same loving image of him.

Addiction is a mental illness, but it is 100% fair for people who are hurt by addiction to be angry or hurt at the person who hurt them. Your bio dad hurt your mom. He hurt you whether you see it that way or not. Doesn\u2019t mean he was a bad person but it does mean that his legacy is more negative than positive.

It doesn't matter if it is long, double-barreled, or even from an entirely different culture/naming system. Your insistence that it won't work is frankly odd.", "Info what do you mean it doesn't work as a middle name?

These feelings are understandably vastly different from yours. That doesn\u2019t make either person correct or incorrect. It just means that feelings that are manageable when contained will no longer be contained.\n\nIf you choose to use the name do so knowing it will be very difficult on your mother. Think about if naming your child after your biological father is really doing what you intend it to do - honoring and positively continuing his memory.\n\nI\u2019m bordering on Y T A based on your comments that you can\u2019t use the name as a middle name because it wouldn\u2019t flow. There are so many solutions to that, including acknowledging that \u201cflow\u201d is subjective and it\u2019s need arbitrary. \n\nUse the names you want because there is meaning behind them. Use nicknames or variations if you don\u2019t feel comfortable using the name for whatever reason. Use a name that your biological father found important or meaningful. You got to know him sober.

It\u2019s great you moved passed what your dad has done, however I think you see him threw rose colored glasses. I think you have made him into some hero for putting you first. Which yes it was probably the most non selfish thing he has ever done. I also think you might feel differently about bio dad once your little one is in your arms. You may know exactly what your mom means about paying tribute to the man that hurt your child once your little one is here. \n\nBut do you know what real courage is being the father you don\u2019t have to be. Being the father that sits up with a sick kid when they didn\u2019t have to. Being the father that gives a child he doesn\u2019t owe anything to everything.\n\nI am not saying you have to name your child after your adoptive dad. But letting you know that your adoptive dad was the man that showed up. Every single day.\n\nPlus also something else to think about.

You see your bio-father as someone who did his best, although he failed badly. Your mother sees him as someone who hurt his daughter (I bet you asked her where your bio-father was and if he didn't love you enough to be there), and who abandoned you and her while she struggled to raise you. Your dad is hurt by how much you glorify someone who wasn't there, while everything he did was just not good enough. \n\n2) Your child is going to grow up.

I wonder if he can't help but feel a bit underappreciated.", "NAH. \n\n\nBut in your place I would carefully consider if the relationship that you could have had with your birth father is more important than the relationship you do actually have with your parents. You have all the right in the world to do whatever you want, but they\u2019re also in their right place to have negative feelings about it and, let\u2019s say, decide to distance from you and your family or put up some other boundaries if more constant contact would only cause them hurt. They don\u2019t really seem to deserve that hurt, so you\u2019d probably have to accept it and not push those boundaries if they do retract.

She got sober and my bio dad tried but struggled. They decided before I was born that it would be best if he weren\u2019t around, at least until he cleaned up his act.\n\nWhen I was 6 months old, my mom met the man she\u2019d later marry and would also adopt me. He\u2019s really the only father figure I\u2019ve ever known. They never hid I was adopted but my adoptive father has treated me the same as my younger siblings. \n\nWhen I was 13, I got into contact with my bio dad. He was finally sober. My parents allowed us to develop a relationship. We grew very close and while I didn\u2019t call him \u201cdad\u201d I loved him very much. Sadly, a year later, he relapsed and overdosed. It devastated me not just to lose him, but also what we could\u2019ve had if he had remained sober. I eventually got into therapy to help with everything.\n\nNow, I\u2019m married and expecting my first child. My parents have been amazing and supportive, my dad walked me down the aisle at my wedding. They are so excited to be grandparents.\n\nMy husband and I recently found out we\u2019re having a boy. We\u2019ve decided to name him after my biological father, to honor his memory. He wasn\u2019t a bad guy. He was just mentally ill (had ptsd) and struggled a lot in life. He loved me enough to know I deserved better and let my dad adopt me. I had an amazing life because he was selfless and self aware enough. \n\nI told my parents and they did not take it well. My dad was quiet and just obviously sad. My mom asked how I could name my child after the man who abandoned me. She said I don\u2019t have to name my child after my adoptive father, but she\u2019s going to struggle with calling her grandchild by the name of the man who \u201ccouldn\u2019t clean up his act\u201d and then \u201ctraumatized her daughter\u201d (I found him).
