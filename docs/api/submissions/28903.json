It\u2019s hard to know what advice to give you based on what you described, which is you working during the week and also doing everything having to do with taking care of your small children. I assume you do all/most of the cooking too. It seems you are ok with this arrangement despite it being overtly an unfair distribution of duties.\nIt leaves me wondering: Why is your husband not involved in getting the kids ready? Why were you the only one up all night with the 1 year old? Did you pressure your husband into becoming a father? If not, why are you fine taking on all the childcare duties? You are basically living like a single mom even though you\u2019re married.", "Why do u homeschool ?", "NTA.  The oldest boy, age 6.  Is the gym husband goes to equipped with childcare or any activities (basketball, racquetball etc.) that the boy could 'play' with Dad?  Figure out if Dad could take oldest boy with him on Saturday mornings.", "Is this a case of \"two hours before go time\" means 'he could have gone to the gym, come back and showered, and still had an hour to help' or a case of 'I asked him to help because there would not have been enough time to do both?' Why are you making plans for early morning events without you both being on the same page about it?\n\nHonestly, did you mention you wanted him to skip the gym at any point *before* he was in the process of leaving? Is the gym something that's part of his routine all the time?\n\nThere are two ways I'd look at it. 1) you made plans for the weekend knowing he'd have to skip the gym, or go earlier, didn't mention it until day of, and just expected everyone to drop everything for your lack or planning or 2) he knew this was coming, decided not to help get the kids ready, since the gym was more important, but also refused to go earlier or change his schedule in any way\n\nEven without knowing, I'm going with NTA because \"thanks for ruining another weekend\" seems.... abusive? If this was a one-off, maybe not a huge deal, but if this is treatment you're always receiving, then that's super unhealthy. You should probably have a conversation with him about parenting duties and how those are being split up, but I'd highly recommend sending your kid to actual school. It's clear you're both overwhelmed, your house seems toxic, and if the two of you can't communicate effectively, isolating your children from the world is only going to harm them.", "YTA not for wanting help, but because instead of being straight forward & asking for it you\u2019re being passive aggressive, making snide comments, & expecting him to read your mind.

Talk to him calmly about the division of labor around the house. Write down everything you do beforehand and also any feelings you want to express. You can\u2019t allow this pattern to continue.\n\nIf you know your husband doesn\u2019t help in the mornings and gets up to go to the gym, and you know you want his help in the mornings, talk to him beforehand. Granted, he should realize he needs to help his family in the morning, but clearly he doesn\u2019t. Best of luck.", "ESH.

Are the two of you fighting a lot rather than communicating?\n\nOnly asking because he sounds resentful, and that's a big red flag imo. I am sorry you felt the need to apologize for asking for some help. It leaves me wondering if whether or not you are both so busy during the weeks that you are burned out and therefore taking it out on each other in the weekend, or if he is manipulating you by making you feel bad for \"ruining\" his weekend because he is holding some sort of resentment towards you. From what you've wrote though it sounds more like the second and he  is trying to also drag you down with him in whatever crisis he is having in regards to family life or parenthood. \n\nSo I am going with NTA - but are you able to safely communicate and have a conversation with him about comments like \"ruined yet another weekend\"?
