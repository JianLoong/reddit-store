We both work from home and I also homeschool my oldest. It can definitely feel like we\u2019re living in close quarters at all times. During the week, we\u2019re all extremely busy and look forward to the weekend to finally relax and go have fun. \n\nBut it seems like far too many times I ruin the weekends by \u201ccomplaining\u201d\n\nLast weekend we had a birthday party to go to early Saturday morning. I\u2019m usually getting myself, the boys, the baby bag, snacks, and everyone\u2019s water bottles ready. My husband gets himself ready. He woke up 2 hours before go time and said he\u2019s going to the gym. To that I said, \u201cwell when we need to be somewhere early in the mornings, I thought you would stay home and help get everyone ready.\u201d\n\nAnd it just turned ugly pretty fast. \nIt ended with me profusely apologizing for what I said and insisting he go to the gym. Telling him I\u2019ll take care of things and get everyone ready. \n\nHis response was \u201cyou expect me to go to the gym after you say something like that? Way to ruin yet another weekend.\u201d\n\nI will say, the night before I barely got any sleep. I was up all night with the little one and I guess I woke up and was a little resentful that he was going to go at this time instead of helping me out. \n\nAm I missing something here?\nAITA?\n\nEdited to add:\nMy work is not full time. I choose my own hours so do a few hours before the boys wake up and few hours after they fall asleep. I do not work during their waking hours unless they are meetings or calls that I cannot control. The homeschool is prioritized. My kids are prioritized.\n\nEdit # 2:\nA lot of people are mentioning the blunder of communication on my part. Fair. I wrote it out on the comments. But didn\u2019t put it in the original post because I didn\u2019t want a really long one. I explicitly told my husband about the birthday party well in advance. We\u2019re talking two weeks ago, then a week ago, then a few days beforehand. Told him hey, we need to be out of the house on Saturday by 11. If there\u2019s anything you have to do, please make sure you come back in time - with enough spare time to get yourself ready and help me with the boys. Because in the past this has been an issue. He underestimates how much time he needs and we end up, ready, waiting on him. \nWell, he didn\u2019t wake up as early as he wanted and with 2 hours until go time he says, I\u2019m going to the gym. I knew he would absolutely not have enough time to go to the gym, come home, shave and shower, get dressed, and help with the boys.", "created_utc": 1697291868, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/177q5rz/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_skip_the_gym_in_the/", "score": 740, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems you are ok with this arrangement despite it being overtly an unfair distribution of duties.\nIt leaves me wondering: Why is your husband not involved in getting the kids ready? Why were you the only one up all night with the 1 year old? Did you pressure your husband into becoming a father? If not, why are you fine taking on all the childcare duties?

Why are you making plans for early morning events without you both being on the same page about it?\n\nHonestly, did you mention you wanted him to skip the gym at any point *before* he was in the process of leaving? Is the gym something that's part of his routine all the time?\n\nThere are two ways I'd look at it. 1) you made plans for the weekend knowing he'd have to skip the gym, or go earlier, didn't mention it until day of, and just expected everyone to drop everything for your lack or planning or 2) he knew this was coming, decided not to help get the kids ready, since the gym was more important, but also refused to go earlier or change his schedule in any way\n\nEven without knowing, I'm going with NTA because \"thanks for ruining another weekend\" seems.... abusive? If this was a one-off, maybe not a huge deal, but if this is treatment you're always receiving, then that's super unhealthy. You should probably have a conversation with him about parenting duties and how those are being split up, but I'd highly recommend sending your kid to actual school. It's clear you're both overwhelmed, your house seems toxic, and if the two of you can't communicate effectively, isolating your children from the world is only going to harm them.", "YTA not for wanting help, but because instead of being straight forward & asking for it you\u2019re being passive aggressive, making snide comments, & expecting him to read your mind.

Talk to him calmly about the division of labor around the house. Write down everything you do beforehand and also any feelings you want to express. You can\u2019t allow this pattern to continue.\n\nIf you know your husband doesn\u2019t help in the mornings and gets up to go to the gym, and you know you want his help in the mornings, talk to him beforehand.

Are the two of you fighting a lot rather than communicating?\n\nOnly asking because he sounds resentful, and that's a big red flag imo. I am sorry you felt the need to apologize for asking for some help. It leaves me wondering if whether or not you are both so busy during the weeks that you are burned out and therefore taking it out on each other in the weekend, or if he is manipulating you by making you feel bad for \"ruining\" his weekend because he is holding some sort of resentment towards you. From what you've wrote though it sounds more like the second and he  is trying to also drag you down with him in whatever crisis he is having in regards to family life or parenthood. \n\nSo I am going with NTA - but are you able to safely communicate and have a conversation with him about comments like \"ruined yet another weekend\"?

I want to share my own background to maybe add context to how your son might be feeling. \n\nWhen I was elementary age, I was tiny (super short and no weight on me!) and I was the oldest child. I did not end up homeschooled but every day when I would go to school it would result in full anxiety driven meltdowns. In third grade I pulled all my eye lashes and eyebrows out. I was a ball of constant anxiety, and I didn\u2019t really outgrow it. \n\nJust recently I\u2019ve been given an OCD diagnosis due to how extreme my anxiety is and the presence of my intrusive thoughts. My therapist has been encouraging me to identify the relationship between my anxiety and my childhood. \n\nIn my house as a child, I grew up with one parent who did the work. This parent did the cooking and cleaning and homework and quality time. The other parent was fun, gave me gifts occasionally, but wasn\u2019t present for the hard stuff. This other parent did not wait in the dark at the end of our driveway with me for the bus. And they were unkind to my main parent. My main parent compensated for all of my other parents failings. And my main parent was super devoted to the other parent. And honestly, I had started to internalize my other parents failings long before they decided to abandon our family when I was 8\u2013they didn\u2019t want to be around to help me with my homework? Probably because I was stupid. They didn\u2019t want to spend their after work time with me? Guess I suck to be around. They didnt want to give up any of their personal morning time to get me ready? I must be too difficult. \n\nYour son may not be articulating these things in the exact way I was, but I can guarantee that he sees these things and is processing them in his own way. And if it\u2019s not being addressed, he\u2019s processing them alone. And he certainly sees more than you think, kids are nosy and they\u2019re sneaky. If he\u2019s predisposed to be anxious about things anyway, though, consider his thought process. I\u2019ll give two examples that are rooted in my personal experience, though you know his anxiety best. \n\nOn one hand, when I saw my own parent apologizing for asking for help and being told that she ruined our plans (which happened a lot, trust me there), it caused me to think that being unable to juggle everything and do it alone was bad, it made it difficult to ask for help when I struggled and it was something that I took to adult relationships\u2014I must be totally independent as a partner, and I was unwilling to share the load. \n\nOn another, when my parents would fight like this, I didn\u2019t always hear the full context (not that it makes it any better), what I would hear is that dealing with me is so difficult that my other parent not only won\u2019t do it\u2014being asked to help me is so bad that it will ruin our entire day and it\u2019s my fault. \n\nYou know your family best, but just keep in mind what your husbands behavior can look like from your already-anxious child\u2019s perspective. At the very least, so you can reassure your son that he is worthy of support. And also because therapy\u2019s not cheap when you\u2019re an adult lol. \n\nThese Reddit posts only give us a glimpse of your life, they are never all encompassing and I could be way off base here, but I just wanted you to know what similar looking glimpses into my own childhood resulted in for me.", "Hopefully, when he matures a bit, he might be willing to look at traditional schooling again.

From the info you've given, you don't have a partner, you have another random adult in your home that gives you no help. I think you need to step back and see if you're really getting what you want and need out of your partnership with your husband - because it should be a partnership, these kids belong to BOTH of you, not to mention maintaining the household outside raising your children - have a serious talk with him, and determine if he's going to be the spouse and partner you need.", "NTA. At the end of the day, it\u2019s both parent\u2019s responsibility to handle the children. It\u2019s teamwork and partnership and taking as much off of each others plate as possible. The best thing for to have done was to ask what help you needed before he went to the gym. The gym is extra and comes after family obligations. Even if he hadn\u2019t been to the gym in a while and his schedule was free for that time, he should\u2019ve asked what help you needed. \n\nEven if it was getting the bags ready, getting clothes out, fixing breakfast\u2026 SOMETHING ANYTHING would\u2019ve been helpful and would not have hurt.", "You also shouldn\u2019t have apologized. Complying just to please when he\u2019s obviously in the wrong is not okay and will create a pattern of response that he will expect. Neglecting responsibility is simply not okay on any circumstance. You are not the only person responsible for your two babies. He is as well. Therefore, you should speak up and explain to him that his responsibilities to the house and family come first.", "NTA. It sounds like you are doing 99% of all the responsibilities and are so scared of your husbands UNFAIR reactions that you end up apologizing for the fact he doesn\u2019t contribute or help you at all.", "The division of labor in your family is grossly unequal. From your posts/comments, you manage your child's education (homeschooled, which isn't easy - I work in education), work part time, handle the majority of child care responsibilities, and take care of event planning / the household mental load. Would not be surprised if you also do all the cooking and cleaning.\n\nUltimately, you're overworked and spreading yourself too thin. You don't have a real partner, because each time you ask for support, you get guilted into believing that you are causing your husband discomfort / inconvenience. So you suck it up, make yourself small, hold it all in, until it becomes unmanageable again, and you have to ask for help. The cycle continues - he tells you it's unfair for you to want support, you feel guilty and hold it in / push through on your own. Make no mistake - he is making these comments on purpose. He WANTS you to stop asking. His comments are intentional, and designed to make you feel bad so you stop asking for support from your partner. But if you can't rely on your partner, who can you rely on?\n\nYou're NTA for asking for help from your life partner. But you are being TA to yourself, for condoning the complete and utter abandonment from the one person you should be able to lean on. Stand up for yourself, mama.", "He can do things in the getting ready in the morning like the gym. When changing the kids. Dead lift him a few times. Then put the shirt on him. Lunge around the room then feed the baby oatmeal.", "NTA -- it sounds like your husband (and to some extent your sons) are assuming you will do all the invisible work on the weekend so they can relax the whole time.\n\nExpecting him to share the work is NOT ruining his weekend. Expecting you to do 100% of it is absolutely ruining yours.\n\nYou deserve a break from taking care of your children especially since you home school AND you are the one who gets up when the kids need attention in the night.\n\nYou need to sit your husband down and make a plan. One idea is that each of you have one day of the weekend in which you are the default parent for everything. If you want to do anything for yourself/on your own that day, you need to ASK the other parent, and/or trade time from your own day.\n\nIn other words, he needs to spend one day a week being you.\n\nHe is still living in a magical pre-children world where he imagines the weekend is only for fun times, and is blaming you for having to keep reminding him that it's not the case.", "NTA: sounds as though he is being selfish and inconsiderate. You\u2019re not asking for too much! And I didn\u2019t hear you say you get alone time at all! To go to the gym, do yoga, or nothing.. but he gets to escape the mornings on the weekends?! And although the job you get monetarily paid for isn\u2019t full time, you are still a wife, the prep queen, a first grade teacher (of a 6yo), a childcare worker (of a 1yo), you take meetings and calls in between, and you work while your kids are down! TF!! When do YOU get to catch a break?!", ">But it seems like far too many times I ruin the weekends by \u201ccomplaining\u201d\n\nA lot of posts like this use language like this when there's some abuse/gaslighting going on. Is he telling you you ruin everything? Bc if so, he's a dick. What does he contribute to this relationship besides money? Op is up with the baby, homeschooling, and working? NTA", "NTA. You have been masterfully gaslit into thinking black is white and up is down. OP I felt so sad for you when I read that you had been convinced that it was you who should apologise, when your husband is clearly just piling everything onto you and manipulating you into thinking that voicing your need for his input is wrong.\n\nHas the penny dropped yet?", "NTA but your husband, wow! He needs to read the room. Does he do any parenting? When you're getting ready for an early event he absolutely needs to skip or reschedule the gym. He's definitely TA here. \n\nHe needs to start contributing to child care.", "NTA Your husband is a big baby.", "NTA at all, and I am worried for you. Also, he\u2019s so thoroughly naturalised a scenario where the parenting is \u201cyour job\u201d that you frame it as \u201chelping me out\u201d. Him getting the kids ready to go out should not be seen as helping you out, it should be seen as him honouring his responsibilities towards some humans he brought into this world. He sounds selfish as fuck.", "Kids need socialization. Especially at that age.", "Yeah she is a total asshole to herself and her children.  YOU are in an abusive relationship!  He is more interested in his Bod then his family, is he a narcissist or fucking around or both?\n\nNTA just blind", "You somehow read this and came away thinking *OP* is the manipulator in this scenario? What a bad take.", "Stop blaming abuse victims, Jesus.", "This isn't just a communication issue. It sounds like your husband is cruel, manipulative, and absolutely unwilling to do his share.

As the one who \u201cruined\u201d things by requesting I be treated with basic human decency, fuuuuuck that. We did couples therapy. I did solo therapy. I read self help books. I tried like hell to find better more productive and kind ways to communicate. I still got screamed at, belittled and threatened. \n\nGenerally, I think people should work on things but your comments and post sound so much like my former life it gives me fucking chills.

Many in my state homeschool in coops, with parents teaching younger grades subjects they're competent in, while hiring people to teach classes as the kids are older. But it's considered homeschooling even in a group, which I realize isn't true everywhere.\n\nSome homeschooling groups rent classrooms in parochial school buildings; one I know of rents classrooms in a bldg with a Montessori day care.\n\nOthers do a coop without a formal school environment. Either kind might hire a professor to teach math and science in higher grades.\n\nSome do homeschooling alone with their kids but most kids have activities outside the home. I know a family that homeschooling the older kids through 6th grade but the youngest through 8th grade as the school their older 2 went to for 7th and 8th wasn't s good fit for the youngest \n\nSome colleges have created curricula for school so it's more than just buying a Maguffey Reader.

Nothing in your post suggests you blindly stumbled into homeschooling without making a carefully considered decision.

It ended up costing him his job but he always said he would never change a thing. He couldn\u2019t imagine my mom doing all the work alone, and she never had to ask. He never would have had her do half the stuff your husband just expects from you. It genuinely makes me sad that he\u2019s conditioned you to think this is normal. It\u2019s not. My dad got up with me at night, switched to be working from home so he could have more time with me.

I was a teenager that was bullied from 10th grade to graduation. I spent half of my junior year at home (being homeschooled) for medical reasons. If I could go back in time I would have begged my parents to let me stay home for 10th grade too. For some kids it really is the best option. Now with Op having children that young and working full time, I imagine that she\u2019s exhausted. There\u2019s no reason why her husband can\u2019t go to the gym at a different time.
