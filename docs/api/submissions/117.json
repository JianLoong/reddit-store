The parents should have said so to their child before the ceremony and should have reminded him. That is still not your job as a niece.

Watch the ceremony quietly or get your wiggles out out here?\" \n\nYou shouldn't apologize to someone with autism for them not understanding a social situation and you not behaving inappropriately alongside them. That reinforces too many behaviors that they should not be learning...", "*She said it was because my cousin's feelings were hurt*\n\nNo.  They realized that their *babysitter* was no longer a pushover, and that they might have to watch the kid themselves.\n\nNTA", "I'm gonna be honest, my whole family pressures me to watch him and let him be all over me. They know I don't like it and it worsens my anxiety but don't care. I have maybe one person in my whole family who makes an effort to stand up for me and I only get to see her a few times a year.", "Not to mention the child in question was all of like 5 years old? Pretty much all 5 year olds get excited or overwhelmed at gatherings. His parents should have been more mindful of this.", "Doubly NTA then. Your aunt and uncle are projecting onto you.", "Well there's you truth OP. They want you to babysit your cousins so they can enjoy the wedding. They're the ones who need to apologise for such behaviour. But we all know they won't.", "you're nta but maybe a bit of verbal communication might helped.", "Good for you. Best of luck in school!", "Ah, gotcha. The post kinda made it sound like you gave him the silent treatment... At least you know where he gets it from. :-/", "I strongly disagree that the married couple wouldn\u2019t care about their wedding ceremony being interrupted by a child trying to talk to someone in the wedding party and that person stepping out of line to speak to someone in the audience.\n\nAlso \u201cif you don\u2019t want it, don\u2019t let 5 year olds in\u201d - based on the parents behavior how do you think not inviting their kid would have gone over?  The married couple would have immediately been called ableist at the mere thought.", "Yeah and it's hard to apologize when you've done nothing wrong.  The parents could've asked op to occupy the kid during the ceremony,  but since they didn't they can't expect you to know what they want. People on here suck at communication and parenting and take it out on everyone else.", "This is a perfect script. With this version of \"I am sorry\" you are not apologizing, you are acknowledging his feelings.\n\nYour aunt and uncle are T A and absolutely ridiculous.\n\nNTA", "This feels like a no-win situation for OP. Had they responded to cousin, mom and family would probably be down their neck about that too. And this is just a random guess, but nothing else seems to explain mom siding with cousin\u2019s parents other than \u201cadults are mad at you so I as your designated adult must be mad at you too to show them I am a Good Parent and keep you under control\u201d", "Absolutely unfair expectations for you!", ">I'm gonna be honest, my whole family pressures me to watch him and let him be all over me.\n\nYeah, NTA. Its one thing to ice out your little cousin, but another one to have adults telling you how your relationship should be, and throwing fits when you don't conform to their expectations", "Oh ... that's not right. At all.", "Ah! The \"Parentification\" of an older child for the younger. Don't let them corral you into being the other \"caretaker\". Get real busy in your life. If they assume you will be the babysitter at family gatherings, be busy doing something else. Ask for tasks that DON'T involve watching someone else's kids.", "So his parents were mad that you weren't performing \"your\" babysitting duties.\n\nOP, this is a hill to die on.  Young women seem to get roped into child care at family events, and it is time that antiquity ends.  You may have a hard time, as you are still a teen, but set those boundaries and stick to them.\n\nAs to the apology, don't.  Talk to the kid, but use the opportunity to explain that the wedding was very important to the bride and groom, and it was Quiet Time, and your silence was out of love for your family, not anger at him.  Tell him he will be going to more family events in his life where it will be important to be still and quiet, and it is good to practice.\n\nP.S.  I think your mom dropped the ball by letting you hang here.   She didn't want to stick up for you.  She should not be hanging you out to dry for this.\n\nNTA", "> I 16f\n\nplus \n\n> my whole family pressures me to watch him\n\n= they are mad that you were not acting as their free babysitter.  I think it's time to tell everyone that you are not watching their kids any more until you are both paid and respected, and even then only when you agree in advance.  NTA", "This explains a lot.     \nDon't worry about apologising, they'll get over it when they want you to watch him next   :(", "I actually usually like little kids and babies but I don't like when they're forced upon me like most people.", "I let my cousin's kids into my wedding and was pissed off that one of them yelled out all through my vows. My expectation had been that a sensible mother would have removed her child to the church hall at the back once the kid kicked off.", "I don't think OP was in the wedding party just a guest. Doesn't change much opinion was but I figured clarity is best", "Asking OP to occupy the kid during the ceremony would have been completely inappropriate because she was in the wedding party, and they knew that! That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t say anything at the time.  They knew how rude it would be. But they\u2019re mad at OP for not stepping up to be the rude one and engage their kid.  They\u2019re so hypocritical it\u2019s laughable.", "Don't say 'sorry.'  Acknowledge the feelings without apologizing for them.\n\n\"Hey, kiddo, I bet you were really upset and hurt that I wasn't talking to you during the ceremony.  I was paying attention to the wedding, and didn't want to interrupt what was going on.  Sometimes it's just not OK to have a conversation, even if we really want to, and I know that can be hard.  But I love talking to you when it's conversation time.\"", "Same! I have to be physically and emotionally ready for that kind of attentional and sensory onslaught. And once I am done, I am DONE. \n\nYou are honestly doing everyone a favor by maintaining your boundaries re: being the temporary caregiver for your cousin. The kid needs to learn boundaries, which he's not going to do if he doesn't see his parents modeling good behavior when presented with them. And I'm sure everyone would want someone who 1) wanted to take care of your cousin and 2) wasn't negatively affected by doing so to the degree that it causes harm to that person.  (Deliberately requesting that you do something that you've repeatedly refused and makes you very anxious is doing harm to you.)\n\nI'm proud of you for sticking up for yourself about the whole thing. If I were related to you, I would definitely go to bat for you with the adults that think you're being unreasonable. I'm sorry that you don't have anyone consistently around to help you with that.", "Do you know what that makes you? Like most people.\n\nNTA", "I didn't read her being in the wedding party at all,  but regardless,  that's what I was getting at,  they didn't even ask her to engage the kid how can they be mad she didn't?", "All kids need to be taught social skills, but autistic kids especially need explicit instruction and extra support! The parents are doing their child a massive disservice.", "\"I am sorry you were upset\" is the classic non apology, because you aren't acknowledging you did anything wrong. But I do think what you said is a good way to explain the situation to a child. It is just too bad that his parents aren't taking care of their child's social education.", "In the English language, the word \u201csorry\u201d really has two pretty distinct meanings. One expresses apologies and remorse, the other expresses sympathy and regret.  OPs aunt is in the wrong for expecting the first type of \u2019sorry\u2019, and OP would be just fine sticking to the second type.", "Exactly.  OP shouldn't apologize, because OP isn't in the wrong.  You can acknowledge and validate somebody's feelings without taking responsibility for them.", "Exactly, my niece is 5 and her Mum tells her at big events we all attend how she needs to behave if she doesn't already know (by experiencing it before) or reminding her if she forgets. It's part of being a good parents tbh", "My kid is obsessed with the feeling of music (like the vibrations). Went to a kid friendly wedding recently. Dj was playing music before the bride and groom first dance. I tried to gently get my toddler off the floor when the dance was announced. He refused and I knew he would not come quietly. Picked him up surfboard style, covered his mouth (not nose) to stifle the screaming a little and carted his butt out the dance hall as the bride and groom took the floor. Once we got out the hall and he realized he could still feel the rumble of the music through the floor, he was happy as could be."]}
