We had a wealthy upbringing. I also believe our parents gave us all the tools to succeed in life. \r  \n\r  \nHowever one thing our parents did which was unique to them was the freedom they gave us when we turned 18. They believed that as adults we are responsible for our own actions, so while they would advise us if need be they wouldn\u2019t push us to take any particular decision. \r  \n\r  \nSo basically at 18, we\u2019d each be given $1 million and told to live our lives. They said if we needed advice we could always come to them, but that\u2019s all the financial help we would get until the inheritance comes.  \r  \n\r  \nThis week we had a family reunion for my dad\u2019s 84th birthday. The same thing happened which always happens. Jake, Marie, Olaf and Edward kept throwing passive-aggressive comments at our parents for their failure in life. They keep painting our parents as evil persons who cared only for themselves for not helping them get out of the sh\\*t they put themselves in. \r  \n\r  \nUsually we put up with it, but this time I really wasn\u2019t in the mood and the continuous comments reached my breaking point so I gave them the truth:\r  \n\r  \nI told Jake how he used the 1m to get a mortgage for a house 5x more expensive and was surprised when he lost everything in 2008 when he was living off a museum curator's salary. \r  \n\r  \nI told Marie how our parents advised her to at least get an architecture degree if she likes drawing so much. But instead she wasted all the money given to her to paint huge expensive paintings which no one but dad\u2019s friends would buy. And now she blames him for having to draw children\u2019s books to make ends meet. \r  \n\r  \nI told Olaf how the reason he lost most of his money is because he kept doing absolutely stupid investments in business he had no idea about. And the few times he asked dad for advice he ended up doing the complete opposite. \r  \n\r  \nAnd Edward\u2026 his inability to be faithful to one partner for more than a year has nothing to do with our parents.   \n\r  \nTold them they should shut up because the success of us other siblings is proof our parents were fine. \r  \n\r  \nOur parents told David early on that he isn\u2019t booksmart, so he shouldn\u2019t bother with college and look for a trade. He actually listened to their advice and joined a carpentry apprenticeship. He used the money he got to make his own business and now he is probably the happiest and most successful of all of us. \r  \n\r  \nDad advised me to do law school. I listened and now I have my own law firm. \r  \n\r  \nSarah just enjoys herself, traveling the world, not working. Because, not only was she wise enough to ask our parents for investment advice. But she is frugal enough to not waste $1m instantly.\r  \nNeedless to say they blew up and called me an asshole. But the thing is dad, David and Sarah say I was to harsh on them.

An 18 year old is still basically a kid.  Handing one a million dollars and basically saying \"OK, you're on your own now, good luck\" is very likely to end up going wrong in various ways.  Blaming a teenager for being irresponsible with a million dollars is like blaming a dog for counter surfing.

So if she thinks you're being harsh, I believe it.\n\nI think you're right that your siblings made their own choices, and that it is ultimately their fault. However, their choices were the result of getting that $1M from your parents. Ultimately, I think both Dad and siblings deserve the misery and you should stay out of this.

To young to have a lot of control, and no experience with money, growing up poor.\n\nAt 21 - same, but slower.

Would pace the splurges, but still justify them.\n\nAt 40 - buy a house with 50% down, or pay current house down to half, put some in the bank, use some for common sense purchases (replace old car, appliances, home upgrades).

Would still buy something expensive that I had been wanting.\n\nAt 60 - pay off EVERYTHING, make sensible necessary purchases that will last a long time.  Hoard as much as possible because the body is starting to hurt and want to retire while I can still enjoy it.\n\nVERDICT:  Age 35.

They have been observing their personalities for 18 years, they should have had a reasonable sense of who was ready for that money and who wasn't. Biggest problem in this comment section is the fact that every 18 year old isn't equal.", ">One bought a big house. Basic math. I spend x. I have x. 18 year olds are out living on their own and figures out how to share apartments with roommates, etc. Make budgets. Even 18 year olds who came from rich homes.\n\nActually nothing about the house thing makes any sense. If that brother (Jake) is 51 right now he would've turned 18 in 1992. If he had bought a $5M home in 1992, he would have been 15-16 years into his mortgage before the GFC happened. He would be millions of dollars in the black on that investment even if he got a 15% loan (which would be bad but possible in the 90s) and never refinanced at a lower rate and never once made any prepayment. It would be virtually impossible for him to have lost money on it since even according to OP he made a 20% downpayment. \n\nThe FHFA publishes an [All Transaction HPI](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx#qat), which is an index of how much housing prices have increased over time, based on both refinances and purchases, with Q1 1980 being set as 100. In Q3 of 1992, which is roughly the time he would have bought a house if he just did it immediately, the HPI averaged over the US (since I don't know what state he was in) was 178.82, The HPI didn't really bottomed out until Q2 2012 when it went down to 308.62, but say in Q1 2009 (when the shit had well and truly already hit the fan) the HPI was still at 350.82.\n\nSo using those figures we can estimate in Q1 2009 that a house bought for $5M in 1992 would have been worth $9.8M. At the lowest point it would have still have been worth $8.2M. And he would have been halfway through his mortgage, so he would have a ton of equity in it. Even if he had done a cash-out refi (and he probably should have in the mid 2000's given that his interest rate on a 1992 mortgage would have been high) he should still have a ton of equity in the home. I don't understand how he could have possibly lost ANY money on such an investment. He would have had to take out like a HELOC or something and gone absolutely insane spending with it. Even if he waited until 2000 (when he was 25) the would still be very, very comfortably in the black. In fact, the earliest he could have purchased that house and actually lost money was Q3 2004, after he'd already had a million dollars for 12 years.\n\nWhat was he doing with this money for the prior 13 years? In the 1990's even if he had just parked it in a savings account (not even a CD!) he would have been making [4-5% annually](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/history-of-savings-account-interest-rates/) on it. Compounding monthly (as most banks do) and making no contributions to it, he would have made another 375k by the year 2000 if he averaged 4% APY on it. Savings yields nosedived in the 2000s but if he didn't but until like 2005 I would still expect him to be up 400-500k over his initial income.\n\nMore than that though, I don't see how he could possibly have gotten a $4M mortgage even with a $1M downpayment as an 18-year-old. He wouldn't have the credit or income history. Even if he did it at 25, he couldn't afford the payments as a museum curator. If it was in like 2005 when we were well into sub-prime loan mania then I still don't get it- \n\nThis doesn't add up _at all_. Something else went down with his money. he would have had to have waited 13 years to buy that house before he would've been meaningfully vulnerable to losing a dime, and by that time he should have gotten a lot wealthier on interest alone even if he did nothing.", "What is exactly your argument?
