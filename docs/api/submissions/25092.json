We had a wealthy upbringing.

The same thing happened which always happens. Jake, Marie, Olaf and Edward kept throwing passive-aggressive comments at our parents for their failure in life. They keep painting our parents as evil persons who cared only for themselves for not helping them get out of the sh\\*t they put themselves in. \r  \n\r  \nUsually we put up with it, but this time I really wasn\u2019t in the mood and the continuous comments reached my breaking point so I gave them the truth:\r  \n\r  \nI told Jake how he used the 1m to get a mortgage for a house 5x more expensive and was surprised when he lost everything in 2008 when he was living off a museum curator's salary. \r  \n\r  \nI told Marie how our parents advised her to at least get an architecture degree if she likes drawing so much. But instead she wasted all the money given to her to paint huge expensive paintings which no one but dad\u2019s friends would buy. And now she blames him for having to draw children\u2019s books to make ends meet. \r  \n\r  \nI told Olaf how the reason he lost most of his money is because he kept doing absolutely stupid investments in business he had no idea about. And the few times he asked dad for advice he ended up doing the complete opposite. \r  \n\r  \nAnd Edward\u2026 his inability to be faithful to one partner for more than a year has nothing to do with our parents.   \n\r  \nTold them they should shut up because the success of us other siblings is proof our parents were fine. \r  \n\r  \nOur parents told David early on that he isn\u2019t booksmart, so he shouldn\u2019t bother with college and look for a trade. He actually listened to their advice and joined a carpentry apprenticeship. He used the money he got to make his own business and now he is probably the happiest and most successful of all of us. \r  \n\r  \nDad advised me to do law school. I listened and now I have my own law firm. \r  \n\r  \nSarah just enjoys herself, traveling the world, not working. Because, not only was she wise enough to ask our parents for investment advice. But she is frugal enough to not waste $1m instantly.\r  \nNeedless to say they blew up and called me an asshole. But the thing is dad, David and Sarah say I was to harsh on them.

An 18 year old is still basically a kid.  Handing one a million dollars and basically saying \"OK, you're on your own now, good luck\" is very likely to end up going wrong in various ways.  Blaming a teenager for being irresponsible with a million dollars is like blaming a dog for counter surfing.

So if she thinks you're being harsh, I believe it.\n\nI think you're right that your siblings made their own choices, and that it is ultimately their fault. However, their choices were the result of getting that $1M from your parents. Ultimately, I think both Dad and siblings deserve the misery and you should stay out of this.

I have x. 18 year olds are out living on their own and figures out how to share apartments with roommates, etc. Make budgets. Even 18 year olds who came from rich homes.\n\nActually nothing about the house thing makes any sense. If that brother (Jake) is 51 right now he would've turned 18 in 1992. If he had bought a $5M home in 1992, he would have been 15-16 years into his mortgage before the GFC happened. He would be millions of dollars in the black on that investment even if he got a 15% loan (which would be bad but possible in the 90s) and never refinanced at a lower rate and never once made any prepayment. It would be virtually impossible for him to have lost money on it since even according to OP he made a 20% downpayment. The increase in the home value would almost certainly be greater than the remaining balance on the mortgage.\n\nA long explanation follows but **tl;dr**: it would have been extremely difficult for him to have lost the money just by buying a home before the market collapse. Something else has to have happened. And I don't think it's fair to criticize an average person for not seeing the 2008 financial crisis coming.\n\nThe FHFA publishes an [All Transaction HPI](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx#qat), which is an index of how much housing prices have increased over time, based on both refinances and purchases, with Q1 1980 being set as 100. In Q3 of 1992, which is roughly the time he would have bought a house if he just did it immediately, the HPI averaged over the US (since I don't know what state he was in) was 178.82, The HPI didn't really bottomed out until Q2 2012 when it went down to 308.62, but say in Q1 2009 (when the shit had well and truly already hit the fan) the HPI was still at 350.82.\n\nSo using those figures we can estimate in Q1 2009 that a house bought for $5M in 1992 would have been worth $9.8M. At the lowest point it would have still have been worth $8.2M. And he would have been halfway through his mortgage, so he would have a ton of equity in it. Even if he had done a cash-out refi (and he probably should have in the mid 2000's given that his interest rate on a 1992 mortgage would have been high) he should still have a ton of equity in the home. I don't understand how he could have possibly lost ANY money on such an investment. He would have had to take out like a HELOC or something and gone absolutely insane spending with it. Even if he waited until 2000 (when he was 25) the would still be very, very comfortably in the black. In fact, the earliest he could have purchased that house and actually lost money was Q3 2004, after he'd already had a million dollars for 12 years.\n\nWhat was he doing with this money for the prior 13 years? In the 1990's even if he had just parked it in a savings account (not even a CD!) he would have been making [4-5% annually](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/history-of-savings-account-interest-rates/) on it. Compounding monthly (as most banks do) and making no contributions to it, he would have made another 375k by the year 2000 if he averaged 4% APY on it. Savings yields nosedived in the 2000s but if he didn't but until like 2005 I would still expect him to be up 400-500k over his initial income.\n\nMore than that though, I don't see how he could possibly have gotten a $4M mortgage even with a $1M downpayment as an 18-year-old. He wouldn't have the credit or income history. Even if he did it at 25, he couldn't afford the payments as a museum curator. If it was in like 2007 when we were well into sub-prime loan mania and he bought at the peak of the market he should still be up hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest.\n\nThis doesn't add up _at all_. Something else went down with his money. he would have had to have waited 13 years to buy that house before he would've been meaningfully vulnerable to losing a dime, and by that time he should have gotten a lot wealthier on interest alone even if he did nothing.", "What is exactly your argument?

Trump a gilded life. The reporting makes clear that in every era of Mr. Trump\u2019s life, his finances were deeply intertwined with, and dependent on, his father\u2019s wealth.\"\n\n\"By age 3, Mr. Trump was earning $200,000 a year in today\u2019s dollars from his father\u2019s empire. He was a millionaire by age 8. By the time he was 17, his father had given him part ownership of a 52-unit apartment building. Soon after Mr. Trump graduated from college, he was receiving the equivalent of $1 million a year from his father. The money increased with the years, to more than $5 million annually in his 40s and 50s.\"\n\n\"The manipulation of values to evade taxes was central to one of the most important financial events in Donald Trump\u2019s life. In an episode never before revealed, Mr. Trump and his siblings gained ownership of most of their father\u2019s empire on Nov. 22, 1997, a year and a half before Fred Trump\u2019s death. Critical to the complex transaction was the value put on the real estate. The lower its value, the lower the gift taxes. The Trumps dodged hundreds of millions in gift taxes by submitting tax returns that grossly undervalued the properties, claiming they were worth just $41.4 million.\"\n\n\"Of course, the story of how Donald Trump got rich cannot be reduced to handouts from his father. Before he became president, his singular achievement was building the brand of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire, a brand so potent it generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue through TV shows, books and licensing deals.\"\n\n\"The biggest payday he ever got from his father came long after Fred Trump\u2019s death. It happened quietly, without the usual Trumpian news conference, on May 4, 2004, when Mr. Trump and his siblings sold off the empire their father had spent 70 years assembling with the dream that it would never leave his family.  \nDonald Trump\u2019s cut: $177.3 million, or $236.2 million in today\u2019s dollars.\"", "4 of the kids clearly were not ready for the responsibility, so I\u2019d have to say that the parents were pretty stupid for thinking that this was a good idea.", "That happens to include Germany,  but also:\n\nCriminals under the age of 21 tend to be prosecuted in juvenile courts, because German Courts and forensic psychology don't usually consider them mature enough to be held responsible for their crimes in the way a, let's say, 23-year-old would be."]}
