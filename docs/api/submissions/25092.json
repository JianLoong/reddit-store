We had a wealthy upbringing. I also believe our parents gave us all the tools to succeed in life. \r  \n\r  \nHowever one thing our parents did which was unique to them was the freedom they gave us when we turned 18. They believed that as adults we are responsible for our own actions, so while they would advise us if need be they wouldn\u2019t push us to take any particular decision. \r  \n\r  \nSo basically at 18, we\u2019d each be given $1 million and told to live our lives. They said if we needed advice we could always come to them, but that\u2019s all the financial help we would get until the inheritance comes.  \r  \n\r  \nThis week we had a family reunion for my dad\u2019s 84th birthday. The same thing happened which always happens. Jake, Marie, Olaf and Edward kept throwing passive-aggressive comments at our parents for their failure in life. They keep painting our parents as evil persons who cared only for themselves for not helping them get out of the sh\\*t they put themselves in. \r  \n\r  \nUsually we put up with it, but this time I really wasn\u2019t in the mood and the continuous comments reached my breaking point so I gave them the truth:\r  \n\r  \nI told Jake how he used the 1m to get a mortgage for a house 5x more expensive and was surprised when he lost everything in 2008 when he was living off a museum curator's salary. \r  \n\r  \nI told Marie how our parents advised her to at least get an architecture degree if she likes drawing so much. But instead she wasted all the money given to her to paint huge expensive paintings which no one but dad\u2019s friends would buy. And now she blames him for having to draw children\u2019s books to make ends meet. \r  \n\r  \nI told Olaf how the reason he lost most of his money is because he kept doing absolutely stupid investments in business he had no idea about. And the few times he asked dad for advice he ended up doing the complete opposite. \r  \n\r  \nAnd Edward\u2026 his inability to be faithful to one partner for more than a year has nothing to do with our parents.   \n\r  \nTold them they should shut up because the success of us other siblings is proof our parents were fine. \r  \n\r  \nOur parents told David early on that he isn\u2019t booksmart, so he shouldn\u2019t bother with college and look for a trade. He actually listened to their advice and joined a carpentry apprenticeship. He used the money he got to make his own business and now he is probably the happiest and most successful of all of us. \r  \n\r  \nDad advised me to do law school. I listened and now I have my own law firm. \r  \n\r  \nSarah just enjoys herself, traveling the world, not working. Because, not only was she wise enough to ask our parents for investment advice. But she is frugal enough to not waste $1m instantly.\r  \nNeedless to say they blew up and called me an asshole. But the thing is dad, David and Sarah say I was to harsh on them.

Receiving $1 million upon turning 18 is a HUGE advantage in life that 99.999% of people don't get. People who have far fewer resources and advantages go on to live happy, successful and fulfilling lives, so if someone with $1 million in start-up cash can't make it happen when they're an adult, they need a reality check and a wakeup call. Their failures are on them. The message may have been harsh but it's one they needed to hear.", "NTA. You were truthful not unkind. I can only dream of being given such an advantage at that age and their ingratitude is disgusting.", "This is bad fiction from someone who doesn't know how money works.", "NTA, but your parents are AH, and didn\u2019t do the right thing. Giving 18 year olds that grew up in a privileged environment a million dollars is beyond stupid.", "I don't think your siblings are necessarily completely wrong.  An 18 year old is still basically a kid.  Handing one a million dollars and basically saying \"OK, you're on your own now, good luck\" is very likely to end up going wrong in various ways.  Blaming a teenager for being irresponsible with a million dollars is like blaming a dog for counter surfing.  Your parents could absolutely have done more to insure that you and your siblings ended up in better shape as adults.  That said, your siblings need to own their own mistakes at some point too.  And it's been decades.  Time to let it go.\n\nESH.", "ESH (except Sarah) - Choices were made and now everyone is living with the results.\n\nMathematically speaking, 3 out of 7 kids being successful is usually considered failing. If we were to examine your parents' decision as a social experiment, most people would have a reaction of the results being undesirable. I wonder if your father looks at it this way, which explains why he thinks you're being harsh. \n\nGiving an 18-year-old $1M, especially if they are not prepared for it, is like giving a toddler a stick of dynamite and just saying don't shake this. Sarah, who had the benefit of 15 years of knowing what was coming and seeing how six other siblings handled the situation, has the best insight into the situation. So if she thinks you're being harsh, I believe it.\n\nI think you're right that your siblings made their own choices, and that it is ultimately their fault. However, their choices were the result of getting that $1M from your parents. Ultimately, I think both Dad and siblings deserve the misery and you should stay out of this. Save your energy for the probability that Dad evenly divides his estate which means you will have to fight your unsuccessful siblings when they start complaining that they deserve more.", "I could say N T A but you are not. The most successful siblings were the younger ones, your parents maybe should have been more careful sending the oldest into thei future with just money. The part about being grown up is not correct; people make mistakes at 18. The younger siblings learned from those mistakes (and maybe were favoured by the parents?) The truth is harsh but it doesn't mean you have to 'tell it like it is'. \n\nEven more l think this is all made up.", "NTA - 99% of 18 old do not receive 1M to start-up their lives.\n\nThey had a good start-up position for life, what they do with it, is their responsability.\n\nNot your parents.", "NTA\n\nThey sound ungrateful and entitled.", "Who the hell gives a bunch of 18 year olds a million dollars each and expects them not to blow it. At 18 you aren't fully mature yet, and are prone to making stupid decisions. Your folks set your siblings up for failure and even though you and other siblings didn't make the same mistakes, it doesn't make any of you something special. If you parents had set up trust funds, they would have made your siblings better prepared for the world. Esh here", "I'm going with NTA - you were harsh, but sometimes that is what is needed to get the point across.  If your parents had just washed their hands after handing you the $$$ but they were actively involved in trying to advise and guide you.", "Most people don't make a million in their entire lives.

That would have been too soon for him.", "This totally happened.", "Your siblings were given a million each and can't figure out how to live life? \n\nI thought I was fortunate to get a used car and kick in the ass on my way out. \n\nMost people have to figure out life without a million bucks in the bank to start with. \n\nYour siblings are the AH.", "NTA. But I wouldn't trust teenagers with substantial amounts of money.... That money should have been given to them in their early to mid-20's, maybe after they've struggled a bit in order to be able to truly appreciate it.", "NTA, but you're letting your parents off the hook.

Sometimes, the truth hurts", "NTA\n\nBut I\u2019d say: listen to your father and other siblings.", "Wow", "NTA, your dad gave them 1m to help them out starting their lives, like....how brat and entitled they are, most of us dont even have half of the help to get a degree alone, they were clueless and stupid going off spending their money, that was totally on them, like you said, your dad did the same for all of you, and 3 of you actually listen and were smart about it and ended up doing pretty well. They needed someone to blame because they dont want to believe they were dumb about it, you just gave them a wake up call to their ungrateful asses.", "NTA. They are dumb. \ud83d\ude2d", "Can you dad adopt me what a marvellous man to give you all that chance your so very lucky if they wasted it thats on them", "NTA  Your siblings are harrassing your elderly parents.  I probably would have finally done exactly what you did.  Your parents were so generous with the money they gave each of you and offered to help with ideas to make the money work for you.  Unfortunately, your siblings were reckless and are now unhappy with the results.  Considering their age they should accept that it was their choices and, therefore, their consequences.  In the end it is up to your parents what they do with their money.  I do not agree that you were too harsh.  I don't think you did anything wrong.", "NTA. Harsh love is still love. Children and people who still act as children need to be called out and corrected when wrong. It\u2019s how we learn. And grow up.", "Why is it people with such privilege are the biggest whiners? \n\nGoing silent now to prevent getting banned.", "NTA. Some people just can't handle the truth.", "NTA. Sometimes the truth hurts and sometimes people need to hear from the people to hear from the people closest to them.", "NTA.  And for all the posts here saying 18-year-olds are basically still kids:  you\u2019re right.  *And somehow* we mature by making mistakes and learning from them.  These 4 siblings all made very big mistakes, and even in middle age clearly haven\u2019t learned *anything* from them.  Y\u2019all acting like giving an adult money and freedom is somehow traumatizing.", "NTA. The truth hurts for those who have fucked up their lives. They want to blame anybody but themselves for the choices they made. You shined a spotlight on their failings instead.", "NTA- You had best dad out there!", "NTA - there will always be perpetual victims, ready to shift the blame onto others, when self awareness and accountability become too much.", "NTA.
