I had a come to Jesus talk with my husband because he never knew his limits and any evening out became a babysitting gig for me. I wanted \"my turn\" to get mildly drunk once in a while and get to enjoy it without worrying - but I know my limit and don't really need *babysitting.* I just need to not be tipsy/drunk and trying to babysit a wasted person. I remember once I had to navigate the Uber after a concert and he was trying to piss in a public park like a dumbass and just... embarrassing me nonstop because he was so loud and stupid. I love my husband, but I can't stand drunk husband. \n\n Another time, I had to switch to water early on because he went balls to the wall with the fruit that marinated in fucking moonshine, and I realized I'd have to be the adult. It was fucking exhausting. Nobody wants to always be the one caring. That she yelled \"my turn\" makes me think it's usually not her turn.\n\nBut now we seldom drink and it's great. Also cheaper on evenings out.", "This sounds like it should more be an INFO request, not a finite judgement assuming it's true.", "Lol why are you ranting about Whitney Houston and acting like a hot shower will kill someone?\n\nFirst of all, OP never mentioned the water temperature, and putting someone who has thrown up all over themselves in the shower is a perfectly normal thing to do? How else was he supposed to get her cleaned up? It\u2019s not bothering to get her back out that OP has to answer for \n\nFurther, Whitney Houston drowned in a bath tub due to decades of cocaine abuse and heart disease. She didn\u2019t just come home drunk one night and die because she took a hot shower", "You seem to know some extra details that I don't. Were you also in the shower?", "This is such a Reddit comment. You don\u2019t even know that OP is American \n\nFurther, you should spend some time around English or Chinese tourists if you think that the Americans are bad.

Weirdo", "Dude. You shouldnt be drinking to the point of having to be babysat. That is absolutely worrying behaviour and you should do some thinking about your relationship with alcohol.", "\"We typically communicate whose turn it is to babysit and who can get sloshed in advance.\"\n\nBased on this, I'm going with ESH.  At your ages, it's irresponsible and frankly a bit gross, to get so \"sloshed\" in public to the point of puking.  No one wants to be around that shit. Learn to have fun without being falling down, puking drunk.", ">and acting like a hot shower will kill someone?\n\nIf you blackout intoxicated, it very easily can. Drowning and hypothermia are also on the table.", "true \n\nbut according to reports Whitney died because the water was too hot, which made her pass out. there were burns marks on her feet and ankles which they think caused her to pass out which caused her drowning. \n\nalso having a shower when you're sick is the right thing to do, but when two people are too wanted to function properly, that one does pass out. it's safer just to wait, sure, you'll stink. but it's safer", "If you aren't alcoholics and you were on vacation I think it's fine to get crazy drunk if that's what you want to do.\n\nYou are both assholes for the behavior and making someone else clean up your mess.  I'd be ashamed for sure, but your wife is equally to blame.  She can't just blame you.", "Why are you calling OP an asshole for something he didn't do? His wife was the one who got sloshed in public to the point of puking, not OP.", "Ok wel\ufffcl OP\u2019s wife was not burned by overly hot water, so why are we discussing this?\n\nBro who is putting a vomit-covered adult in their bed with them. Weren\u2019t you just feeling sorry for the hotel staff in your last comment? I\u2019m sure they would be just thrilled to come and clean up puke covered sheets \n\nIt\u2019s like, perfectly fine to jump in the shower while drunk, I think you are being a little dramatic here. OP just shouldn\u2019t have gotten into bed until he knew his wife was out.", "You\u2019d have to be absolutely insane as well to think you can down that many shots at the bar and be ok! I don\u2019t even know why you think that\u2019s a good idea.", "I really don't see how OP is to blame still. He's partially TA for what? Getting his wife and himself back to the hotel safely. Or falling asleep while she wrecks the room?"]}
