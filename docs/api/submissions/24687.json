I drink, love my drink...but im not aiming at black out drunk.  the goal is to have fun.  this is not fun.", "yeah this was weird", "They haven\u2019t yet\u2026 they might reach back out after getting an estimate on damages.", "Yeah, he's tipsy when he realises she's trashed so he must have carried on drinking. Should be aita for carrying on drinking (or drank so much 40% alcohol it hit him in the next 30 mins). Was she supposed to babysit him?", "dImmediately thought the same at \"my turn to get drunk.\" Not excusing the behavior, it's very immature for the wife to do. But seeing your husband get drunk saying \"my turn to get drunk\" and immediately downing TWELVE SHOTS of liquor. C'mon, there's a backstory there.", "This is also like\u2026 amateur hour drunk. 16 year old just discovered fireball drunk. Everyone gets a few bad nights in their life but you should ideally have a good idea of your limits by the time you\u2019re 30, especially if you\u2019re in a foreign city.", "I get the feeling that OP was pissed about his wife being drunk and messy and knowingly left her in the shower because he didn\u2019t want to deal with her. Coming onto Reddit and almost encouraging people to berate his wife is just weird partner behavior.", "You guys have never accidentally overdone it and gotten too drunk? Because that definitely happens", "\"It's my turn to get drunk\" kind of showed there is a lot of context missing. I imagine she babysits him quite a bit which is where this came from.", "Accidentally, yes. Taking 12 shots at once is not an accident.", "I annoyed so many drunk passed out people in college telling them to lay on their sides.", "I found a friend drowning in her vomit when I was 14, a few of us shared about 2/3 of a bottle of vodka, I think she'd had around 3 shots.  The rest of us were downstairs mucking around, being screaming teenage girls, when I noticed she hadn't been around for a while.  Went back to the room upstairs where we'd been drinking, and she was on her back, blue, with a *fountain* of vomit coming out of her mouth.  When we finally got her to the ER we found out she had some undiagnosed kidney issue that caused her to get super drunk super fast, it was her first time really drinking, so she had no idea.  If I waited a few more minutes, I dunno...", "He's the one who said he put her in the shower. He put her into the situation where she could have drowned or slipped or hit her head, not that she wandered off to go take a shower.", ">when it comes to the shower I don\u2019t understand why the drunk excuse flies for her but not him.\n\nNobody's saying it flies for her but not him. They're saying it doesn't fly for either of them, and they're assholes.", "What do you think ESH means?  Literally nobody here is defending her!", "They're MARRIED. God why do redditors have a 24/7 selfish mindset?", "Sorry to hear that", "You're right about that. I had meant before that, but it doesn't seem likely in retrospect.  Thanks."]}
