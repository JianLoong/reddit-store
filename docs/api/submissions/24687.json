I was asleep!\u201d \n\nI\u2019m sure for them they thought they were handling it well, not realizing how everyone around them managed their messes because asking them to do it led nowhere and we all eventually just gave up until our lease was over. \n\nYou may be handling things perfectly well, this is just to say that there certainly are alcoholics who cannot handle themselves but are so deep in denial that they either lie about it or truly believe they don\u2019t have issues.", "This is why we call New Year\u2019s Eve \u2018Amateur Night.\u2019", "Have to confirm this here.

That's not the same thing as alcoholism afaik, though neither is good.", "Honestly, it sounds less to me like she's used to doing that, and more like she is sick of ALWAYS taking care of drink him and was determined to be the drunk one today.  I doubt she's ever taken 12 shots before.", "Those shots wouldn\u2019t have made an alcoholic sick as fuck, tho.", "Binge drinking isnt a singular night of drinking lmao", "You've never met an alcoholic with \"fuck you\" money, then lol.", "Exactly what I was thinking lol", "Lol what?

She could have choked on her own puke. She could have drowned in the puddle she created by blocking the drain. And sure, she is the one who got crazy drunk, so it's definitely her fault too.

How is her getting fucked yo his fault???? My god men are always bad on Reddit.", "I really don't get this point at all.

Puking does not automatically translate to alcohol poisoning, it could just be gastritis or someone getting dizzy and throwing up from that.\n\nYou can also absolutely get drunk enough to need someone to watch you without puking or passing out. It's just good etiquette.", "Your taking that comment as they take turns every time they drink, it could have meant \u2018my turn tonight\u2019 or \u2018my turn on this vacation\u2019 so yeah, it is assumption.", "Yes, but this obviously seems like an anomaly based on the post.\n\nHowever, getting silly wasted and throwing up once a year?

As you say, alcoholism involves addiction. Some people can drink heavily and frequently, and then just\u2026not. My grandfather grew up in an age of heavy alcohol consumption and drank A LOT. Then when day his doctor told him it was bad for him (again, the age where smoking and drinking weren\u2019t really known to be bad). So Gramps just quit.

Most people who don\u2019t drink regularly lose track very quickly.", "I agree, but that's not alcoholism. Sounds more like a binge drinking problem.", "So no imo what? Where she did it doesn't make her more or less of an alcoholic, which is still up in the air based on how routine this is.
