He goes inside of a cafe that is located in the office building. I don't know what the exact problem is, but he has a very severe limp, and it's like he only has one functioning leg. Whenever I see him approaching, I get up out of my chair and walk over to the front, and hold the door open for him to enter, even though I'm not required and no one has ever asked me to. I also hold the door open to the cafe he visits since their door is fairly close to the front door. He always has a small bag that he brings with him. I'm not sure what's inside of it. It could be a laptop or something, but the bag is not heavy, and this guy might be older, but he's not frail at all.\n\nBut lately, he's been asking me to carry his bag out to his car which he parks directly in front of our building, and place it on the ground. He also asked me once to carry the bag and place it in the cafe for him. He recently also asked me to wheel him to the bathroom because he came into the building before the cafe opened and he had to use the bathroom really bad. So I let him sit in my chair and I wheeled him to the bathroom because I was worried he would piss himself or go on the floor.\n\nHe's not mean or anything like that, and we've had basic conversations to get to know one another since he sometimes enters the building before the cafe opens and waits outside their door, but I feel like he's looking at me as a servant and is trying to take advantage of me. None of my other coworkers, even the cafe workers, ever help him with anything, and he never asks them to. At this point I want to stop helping him all together. I don't even want to open the door anymore. I'm just worried about the potential awkwardness of everything if I stop.

The door situation is actually something that could be solved with an assistive device. Your building could get one of those automatic door openers that he could press while walking in/out. \n\nI do not believe that you should be assisting anyone to the bathroom if it makes you feel uncomfortable. You can say \u201cI actually need to stay here at the desk.\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019m sorry- that is too personal of a task for me to help with.\u201d Sounds like he needs a strap for the laptop case and that problem will be solved!", "NTA. \"Sorry, I can't leave my work area.\" End of discussion", "NTA but what you are doing is a nice thing. No, it is not required and that you are doing these things shows you are a better human than those around you. \n\nIf you want to stop, begin to tell him things like \"I cant leave my desk area\".", "NAH \n\nI would continue assisting him with the door. It is a basic courtesy and a very professional thing to do, and it's all within sight of the front desk. But beyond that, you have no obligation to help. You need to be near your workspace, so going out the parking lot or restroom is beyond your duties. Explain next time that you can no longer leave your immediate work area for security reasons.", "NTA You can explain to him that what you have done previously was personal but you are on your job and working outside of your duties. You will not be able to continue.", "NTA.\n\n\"So I let him sit in my chair and I wheeled him to the bathroom because I was worried he would piss himself or go on the floor.\"\n\nYou should refuse to do this sort of thing for sure--if he asks, I'd let him know that your employer has concerns about potential liability. If he fell out of the chair, which isn't made for transporting people, he could be injured and your emplloyer sued.", "Nta you have been kind and now he is taking advantage.  Sound like he likes the attention. You are not required to be his aid. Next time just say sorry I am afraid I can't do that right now and look busy.

Or stop openong the doors, too. By doing more you might be pzutting a liability on your employer.", "NTA. It sounds like he's now taking advantage and it was really nice of you to do those things for him. I would put your foot down gently and establish some bpundaries, because he probably will expect more from you.", "YTA", "Yeah it was awkward but I was worried he was going to piss himself.", "He\u2019s seen me do it before which is why I have a hard time saying that", "My desk area is directly in front of the door, and he sees me walk all around the building because at times I have to.", "Yea I thought of that but it was a spur of the moment thing. I regretted doing it as soon as he went into the bathroom", "Yeah and if someone else holds the door open and I don\u2019t need to, he never even looks in my direction to say hi or anything.", "Yea I\u2019m definitely not supposed to wheel him around in a chair, so I\u2019ll avoid doing that in the future", "I want to stop because it honestly is getting annoying getting up each time, and most recently, he asked me to stop what I was doing with someone else to assist him with taking his bags. In that moment he was interfering with my job because I was dealing with a vendor for the building .", "Because he's expecting more and more. It's gone from opening a door to carry bags to taking the man into the toilet.\n\nThere's even a chance he might be able to do things perfectly well himself and is just taking advantage, to quote the OP:\n\n> this guy might be older, but he's not frail at all.", "Yea that\u2019s what I feel like because today I didn\u2019t get up to open the door, but he still asked me to help him carry his bag to his car, which I did. The car is only around 10 steps from the door", "Absolutely- what you did was very kind, and thoughtful. But if he can\u2019t make it from the car into the cafe, or to the bathroom, without having an incident, he needs to be wearing some sort of brief/adult absorbent diaper. It\u2019s unfair of him to request that of you.", "\u201cSorry.  I\u2019ve been told I need to stay in my work area. I won\u2019t be able to help you anymore.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t do that.  I am unable to accommodate you.  That won\u2019t be possible.  I just can\u2019t.  No thank you.  I am unable to help you further.", "Just start telling him \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t do that right now.\u201d It\u2019s ok for him to be unhappy.", "I think you can bring it back and set some boundaries without making it awkward. I'd continue opening the door for him, but if he makes other requests I would simply say you are not allowed to leave your desk for anything else.", "This is what you need to tell him. Helping him is becoming an issue with your job and you can't help him any further because of that. He'll probably complain about you so be prepared.", "Yea that\u2019s my thing. It\u2019s him expecting more and more", "Yea I just know it\u2019ll be awkward if I just up and stop helping him. We can\u2019t avoid each other in terms of seeing one another", "His car is only a few steps from our door and I can\u2019t really say I\u2019m not allowed to leave my work area because he sees me do it all the time", "In all honesty I wouldn't be surprised if he asks you to fetch/order a coffee/meal for him next.", "Yep, it will be awkward. But you will need to set the boundary. 1) You\u2019re an adult, 2) it\u2019s not your job to do that, 3) you don\u2019t want to do that, 4) you don\u2019t have to do that. It\u2019s that simple. You will not be an asshole for telling someone no.", "First, I sympathize for the \"no good deed goes unpunished\" situation, but please grow a spine. Either tell him you won't be able help anymore or keep doing it. Don't cause your own problem.", "You can absolutely still say all of those things.  His aide duties are literally not part of your job.  Every time you help him, you are effectively taking a break and giving him your personal time.  Is your job okay with you taking tons of 5-10 minute unreported breaks?\n\nI cannot help you anymore.  I need to focus on my duties.  I am not able to do that.  I have to stay here.  I can\u2019t do that sir.  That\u2019s inappropriate.  I am not able to do that.", "That\u2019s why I want to stop helping him with everything. It\u2019s more and more", "Should I even bother saying anything? Or just stop holding the door period?", "I would only say something if he says something first. And just be real about it. \u201cI know I\u2019ve helped you in the past but I need to stay at this desk, it\u2019s part of my job. You understand. I hope you have a wonderful day.\u201d \n\nI once got in trouble (I work in a hospital) for giving someone a ride in an office chair because all other wheelchairs were in use. Liability wise, it\u2019s best not to interfere/aid with devices that are not designed for assistive tasks, just in case something breaks.", "I understand. I just hate confrontation. If he complains about me, no one will care because I\u2019m the only person that ever helped him and I can explain why I\u2019ve stopped\nIt\u2019s just awkward because I\u2019m supposed to greet anyone who walks through the front door. So watching him open the door and him potentially staring at me while he does it will be awkward", "You\u2019re gonna have to confront the discomfort of you want the behaviour to stop. And you\u2019re gonna have to set a boundary. That\u2019s pretty much it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nJust out of curiosity..if no one cares if he complains, why does the confrontation matter so much to you?", "He\u2019s someone I see every time I go to work. I just prefer not to have bad blood with people I can\u2019t avoid."]}
