I noticed it was nearly half gone after two weeks of me buying it (It usually lasts me a month or more) and realized my roommate had been using it both day and night. I didn\u2019t have an issue but I felt a little upset she didn\u2019t ask beforehand knowing it was expensive (she made a comment about it after googling it) and not offering to replace it once it was out. I brought this up and she brushed it off and said she was sorry she didn\u2019t think it was a big deal, that I was being dramatic and that it works for her skin, and has never found something so nice (and continued to use it).

I saw an ad for another brand of skincare and wanted to try it out. I bought the cleanser and toner from this brand.

Her being a cheap wh*re is what caused this.", "LOL, NTA.\n\nRoomie can BUY HER OWN SKINCARE PRODUCTS and not have any issues. She FA&FO. Oh well.\n\nReminds me of my friend's roommate in college. My friend brought several boxes of tampons when she moved up to college - to save room, she put them all in a plastic tub in her closet. After a couple of months, she noticed that her supply was depleting quickly and figured out that her roommate was helping herself to my friend's stash.\n\nFriend was PISSED (tampons are pricey!) and told roomie to stop using the tampons and buy her own. Of course, roomie denied the whole thing. BUT roomie didn't remember that she mentioned to friend that she was \"severely allergic\" to any kind of scented feminine products (remember when they used to sell *scented tampons*?!?!?). \n\nAs I said, friend was PISSED both about the tampon theft and the outright lies. She took her stash of tampons and stored them in another friend's room - she'd just fill her backpack with what she needed when she got her period so roomie couldn't steal t hem. But she REPLACED her stash in the closet with SCENTED tampons, but took them out of their boxes so it wouldn't be obvious that they were scented.\n\nWell, a couple of weeks later roomie was miserable, complaining how she had some kind of infection or rash in her \"private area\" and didn't know what happened. She had to go to the campus health service because she was so very uncomfortable.\n\nMy friend just laughed. She left the scented tampons there for another couple of months and then replaced them with her tampons. No further issues - no one was using her tampons but her for the rest of the year.", "NTA", "Definitely NTA. You don\u2019t purchase your products to cater her needs. Also, based on your description, the original face wash she was stealing sounds like Tata Harper. You are chiller than I am, because I would flip if someone stole even a drop of that from me.", "NTA.

And you do need a new roommate.", "NTA.  Reminds me of when I was in college.  I was a poor college student and didn\u2019t get help from parents.  Every toiletry I had was cheap store brand.  I kept running out of everything, especially hairspray and shampoo.  I kept noticing that I was going through it an an alarming pace.  I asked my roommates and they all said no.  I explained that I didn\u2019t get help and extra expenses were a hardship.  I couldn\u2019t believe I was using as much as was missing.  When the bottles got low, I decided to do a test.  I put some hair lightener in each of them.  One of my roommates hair kept getting lighter.  She started complaining about my shampoo and hairspray.  I asked her what she was talking about and she asked why my hair wasn\u2019t lighter even though she was using the same products.  I had new bottles that I carried back and forth to my room.  She called me the AH when she figured it out.  My point is that if she wasn\u2019t both lying and essentially stealing from me, it wouldn\u2019t have happened and it didn\u2019t happen with the other roommates.  She said I should have realized it was her and just let it go.  Keep in mind I had a car and she didn\u2019t and was very gracious in taking her everywhere and never got gas money either.

She ignored your warnings about getting her own and didn't pay attention to the different cleanser when stealing. What did she expect? That you would announce you changed your own products to her when it wasn't her business what you use on your face? \n\nIncidentally. Drop the cleanser name... \ud83d\ude36.

Roommate is just clearly used to using your stuff for her own.
