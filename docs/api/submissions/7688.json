My roommate F (20) has extremely sensitive skin and if an ingredient is placed on her skin that she is allergic to or causes a reaction, she gets small clusters of breakouts and her skin is usually very inflamed/red for a long period of time. Due to this, she is very cautious of what is placed on her skin and needs to read each label before using a product.\nWe share one bathroom and have different sinks separating each side. It is clear one side is mine and one side is hers. On my side, I have a cleanser I use daily (It is a little pricey but I don\u2019t mind spending a bit more on myself when I like a product) I leave it out on the counter because it\u2019s more convenient for me (on my respective side). I noticed it was nearly half gone after two weeks of me buying it (It usually lasts me a month or more) and realized my roommate had been using it both day and night. I didn\u2019t have an issue but I felt a little upset she didn\u2019t ask beforehand knowing it was expensive (she made a comment about it after googling it) and not offering to replace it once it was out. I brought this up and she brushed it off and said she was sorry she didn\u2019t think it was a big deal, that I was being dramatic and that it works for her skin, and has never found something so nice (and continued to use it). I offered to send her the link to get her her own and she said ok thanks and never did. As I said I like to use different skincare and cycle-through products. I saw an ad for another brand of skincare and wanted to try it out. I bought the cleanser and toner from this brand. I replaced my old cleanser with this one and they had very different packaging (this was in a plastic container my other one was glass and green) and different ingredients.

Her skin has its stages of acne and she was even on medication for it but it was in remission up until this point.

After a couple of months, she noticed that her supply was depleting quickly and figured out that her roommate was helping herself to my friend's stash.\n\nFriend was PISSED (tampons are pricey!) and told roomie to stop using the tampons and buy her own. Of course, roomie denied the whole thing. BUT roomie didn't remember that she mentioned to friend that she was \"severely allergic\" to any kind of scented feminine products (remember when they used to sell *scented tampons*?!?!?). \n\nAs I said, friend was PISSED both about the tampon theft and the outright lies. She took her stash of tampons and stored them in another friend's room - she'd just fill her backpack with what she needed when she got her period so roomie couldn't steal t hem. But she REPLACED her stash in the closet with SCENTED tampons, but took them out of their boxes so it wouldn't be obvious that they were scented.\n\nWell, a couple of weeks later roomie was miserable, complaining how she had some kind of infection or rash in her \"private area\" and didn't know what happened. She had to go to the campus health service because she was so very uncomfortable.\n\nMy friend just laughed.
