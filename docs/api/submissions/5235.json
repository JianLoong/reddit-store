My girlfriend, her sister, her mom, and her dad all went to college. I just got a job making $70k and only will be making more, potentially well over $200k by the age of 30. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be limited because he didn\u2019t go to school\u201d was their response. Mind you, my career doesn\u2019t require a degree. The only reason she told her family this was because of things they said in the past. Things like \u201cany decent job requires at least a bachelors\u201d, \u201che\u2019s unmotivated\u201c, & \u201che has barley anything going for him\u201d\u2026 my girlfriend has pretty much allowed this. So much so that after she told them about my job and salary, she texted me saying that maybe I should just get an associates. \n\nMind you, before me and my girlfriend got together she did drugs, she sold pictures of herself to men for money, she led men to believe they were a couple for money. But I\u2019m the \u201cunmotivated\u201d, \u201climited\u201d guy because I didn\u2019t go to school. \n\nHer dad\u2026 the only person in the house who works has said things like, \u201cyou\u2019ll figure it out\u201d & \u201cI didn\u2019t make the kind of money I did for years into my career\u201d. All her mom complains about is \u201cwe don\u2019t have the money\u201d, yet she refuses to work, they live in an $800k dollar house, drive an $80k car, and her moms life revolves around a dog that no joke, eats a diet that cost roughly $800 or so a month. \n\nI just got some really scary medical news. I asked my girlfriend to come to my house and stay for 2 days before we go up for Christmas so I can process everything and have her to lean on as I don\u2019t really have anyone else. She told me she\u2019d be here today. Well she called me saying her mom said \u201cNo, you\u2019ve only been together 7 months\u201d. Even after telling her mom what\u2019s going on. I really wanted to process everything and not be alone before I have to go and be at her house for 2 weeks pretending I don\u2019t know the things they\u2019ve said and how they feel. \n\nI really want to be with my girlfriend but I am so upset. I really want to tell her mom and sister how I really feel. I just really want my girlfriend to come be with me.", "created_utc": 1671570667, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqzsyp/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_if_she_chooses_to/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sometimes you need to be an adult and pull the bandaid off.  You clearly have issues with her past, and she isn't capable of being there when you need her most.
