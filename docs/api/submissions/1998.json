The bf did the right thing by exiting WITH you.  That should be enough proof for you both to avoid \"family\" gatherings for the very near future, unless YOU host.", "NTA, No means no. In every context. You said no, she persisted, you said no again, and she kept persisting.   \nI just think it's weird in general to want to try someone else's necklace on too...", "NTA that\u2019s so weird, not once in my life has anyone ever asked to try on a piece of my jewellery. \nShe didn\u2019t ask either, she basically demanded and then threw a tantrum like a child when you obviously said no, like any normal person would.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nWhat the heck, why is she asking this?\n\nIts so weird im wondering if she wanted to put some spell on your necklace. its so weird and disrespectful. \n\nHis family inviting her and siding with her, even though she is completely unreasonable, is very telling.", "> His family are doing her absolutely no favors in perpetuating this fantasy and giving in to her.

OP also said in another comment that the ex-friend is a friend of her BF's family and that is probably why she was gossiping with the BF's sister.", "I have never in my life asked anyone if I can try on their jewelry.\n\nI've had a friend hand me their jewelry to try on. At her bachelorette party, we wanted to go into a club and dance but none of us wanted to go into that club badly enough to pay the cover (which was probably only like $5, but we were cheap and just wanted to go in for like 15-30mins, do a shot and dance around and then stumble home-the club was 2blks from the place we were staying). We wanted to see if they'd let in a bachelorette party for free. My friend didnt feel like being a bride-to-be causing a minor scene and for some reason she decided I could pull it off so she put her engagement ring on my finger and a tiara on my head and sort of pushed me towards the bouncer while everyone else went \"woooo!\" around me. I did not pull it off and it did not work.\n\nNTA.", "Nta. Please avoid his family for your mental health. You're under no obligation to let someone wear your clothes or have to stand there while they call you a bitch. If my husband heard that, he'd be extremely pissed at his family.

Or try to keep it/leave with it.", "Context or not - she was free to ask, just as you were free to say no.  \nThe fact she did not accept your no - and tried to guilt trip, manipulate you, and later even use others to try and force it from you pushes all of them into the entitled AH corner.\n\nYou and BF : NTA", "My mom did this but my birthstone has a couple options and I don't blame her for picking the cheaper one but it was extremely disappointing not getting to my birthstone in person.", "Can I try it on?

Its definitly a weird request depending on the friends age. If she is like 11 - 14 i can see why everything shiny would be a temptaition for her, but if she is older, its creepy.", "NTA. I would not let an acquaintance try on expensive jewelry either.", "NTA this is super weird. Does she want to try on your knickers aswell.", "Absolutely NTA.

NTA. Keep your jewelry on you!", "NTA but man those people are weird.", "NTA. That necklace was just as personal between you and your boyfriend as a wedding ring. You don't let someone else wear your engagement or wedding ring, why would you let them wear a necklace that is symbolic of your relationship together?", "NTA. That is a weird and disgusting request. I know that statement is going to be confusing. I'm a germaphobe, and having someone ask to wear a piece of my jewelry for even a minute is just an absolutely disgusting prospect, in my opinion. I even wash jewelry and clothing before wearing them after I bring them home from the store. Your boyfriend is great for sticking up for you, his family is unreasonable for thinking that's a normal request.", "NTA. In Italian we have a saying, \"to ask is permitted, to answer is courtesy\".

And what type of people ask to try on other peoples jewelry?  That is creepy.

Smacks of a conspiracy!", "She overstepped and initiated the situation which led to a scene. Next time his mom says anything ask her to take her engagement and wedding ring off and let the girl try it on. See what she says. You need to go LC. His sister is conspiring against you.", "NTA No is No as simple as that. She insisted only to make you uncomfortable.", "NTA \n\nShe wanted to pretend that she was the GF vs. you, and I doubt that you'd have gotten the necklace back.\n\nAs your BF is on your side, I hope he messages his family to tell them that he has 0 interest in dating HS girl, and he is ashamed of how they treat you. Until they can promise to use the manners they taught him, then he will not be coming around. He is tired of them disrespecting his choice in who to date.", "NTA, There is not a single reason for this person to try on your necklace.", "NTA IMO it's super weird/gross to ask to try on anyone's jewelry, I know not everyone has a problem with it, but the idea of it makes me uncomfortable... earings and rings especially, most people (or at least the people I know) don't clean their jewelry.\n\nThe amount of sweat and bacteria and God knows what residues... my sister's earings smell when she finally takes them out after a couple weeks of wearing a set.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou stood your ground against a person who couldn't take a no. This makes you NTA even with all context stripped away. You having to snap at her wouldn't have needed to happen if she had just stopped asking after the first no, as she should have.\n\nSuch a weird request, at least in my opinion. I personally would never ask someone I am not super mega close with to take off the necklace they are wearing at the moment just so I can try it on.", "NTA\n\nIf you said no at her first request then that's all there is too it. I hate it when people try and make you feel bad about not bending your will. Like sorry I dont want to have someone else wear my necklace. Even if it wasnt sentimental the answer was and still is no.", "They clearly don't like you or want you there.  So why did you subject yourself to unnecessary conflict.   If you decided to go in spite of that and figured you'd just deal with the BS, then that's fine, but why question it when the inevitable happens?", "NTA - its weird behaviour to ask to try on what strangers are wearing !\n\nPerhaps she thought she was trying to bond but she couldn't take a polite 'NO'?  You can admire what somebody is wearing but who does that !?!?!", "I've never looked at someone's jewellery and gone \"I need to try that on right now\". I don't think I've ever even considered it, what a strange thing to ask.", "Can I try it on?", "Might be a family friend", "Spot on", "Or they were all somehow back in third grade for a minute.", "NTA.  Others don\u2019t \u201ctry\u201d on your jewelry.  Sorry but she, his mother and family are out of line.  My guess is they like the girl, not you. \n\nEnsure your boyfriends sticks up for you and next time he says NO and handles his family.", "Meh, NTA but I'm surprised at the intensity of your response and the responses here. Sure, it was a weird request and inappropriate, but it's not like a *magic* necklace, is it? It's not as if, were she to put it on, it would make her more attractive to your partner or give her some power over him or you. It's not like she was going to run off with it. Her request was weird but ultimately harmless.", "NTA - but holy smokes is that girl and your bf\u2019s family. Yikes. It is completely inappropriate to badger someone to try on a piece of their jewelry. The fact that you were wearing it is all the mor reason for this to be such an absurd request.", "NTA. You're more graceful than I am, I would have started asking your boyfriends mom if I could try on her wedding ring. Gush and coo over how much youve always loooved it, and break out the tears when she (rightfully) says no.", "NTA\n\nNO ONE asks for that?! Wth?! Clearly your boyfriend's family don't like you and they probably prefer he was with this ex friend! I'd not go to any more events with them", "A better way to handle it may have been to say something like \u201c I love it and my boyfriend too much to let anyone else wear it\u201d.  That may have shut her down.  NTA to set a boundary and stop second guessing yourself.", "NTA but not smart, either.  These  people cannot be handled by getting mad and being rude.  When you did that, she won.  She got you to look like a mean, selfish AH, and she gets to play the part of innocent victim.  In HIS family.\n\nI'm not good at this, but fortunately I haven't had to have a lot of practice.  But what you've got to do is be sweet as honey, while still holding to your boundaries.\n\n\"Oh yes, it is a lovely necklace, isn't it.  I haven't taken it off since BF gave it to me.  I know you would look lovely in it,  but it means the world to me.  I feel so attached to it already, and I am just not ready to take it off yet.  Oh, I know you don't mean to pressure me, but please stop asking, it's making me so uncomfortable and I know you wouldn't want to make me feel bad.   You're so sweet to admire it.  You should ask my BF where he got it, and put it on your Christmas list.  No, really, I just can't take it off.  You're making me feel so badly, but I just can't.\"  <sob and a tear or two wouldn't hurt.>\n\nThe more she goes on, the more of a bully she looks.  The more distressed you look, while being absolutely kindness itself, is the answer here.", "NTA the gf was really pushing boundaries but various family members supporting her? Doesn't sound like you are going to be in for a good time with his family.", "NTA of course you were right...if you don't want her to try you don't want it full stop.
