He told me I didn\u2019t have to go but I felt a little bad if I let him deal with them alone so I decided to come a long too.\n\nThe get together was fine until his friend well more like ex friend came up to me and started gushing over my necklace. I would have taken it as a normal compliment if I didn\u2019t know how this girl was. She has been in love with my boyfriend since they were teens and apparently she has yet to let it go. \n\nMy boyfriend saw how she was annoying me and took me away to get some more food and when we came back she came right back up to me and begged me to let her try on the necklace. What possessed her to even ask that is beyond me but I politely declined and told her I wasn\u2019t comfortable with her doing that. She kept on pleading and telling me how she just wanted to see how it would look on her. \n\nI snapped at her telling her she was pushing my boundaries and said \u201cfor the love of god please stop asking.\u201d She got upset and looked a bit teary eyed. She went to the other room dragging my boyfriends little sister with her and I could tell they were ranting about me. My boyfriends mom pulled me aside and said I was being unreasonable and if I had a heart in me I would have just let the poor girl try it on.\n\nI walked away from her to go get my boyfriend so we could leave because I was seconds away from losing it and I heard a couple of his family members talking about how much of a bitch I am. \n\nMy boyfriend has been reassuring that I was completely right for how I acted and his ex friend needed to let it go but I still can\u2019t help but feel upset about it. I don\u2019t know if she was necessarily aware of the context of the necklace or that my boyfriend gave it to me but I thought it was pretty obvious.

It\u2019s a super weird request. My grandma has a custom necklace with gemstones for all her grandchildren, and in 27 years not one person has ever asked to try it on. You don\u2019t need to accommodate a weird person you don\u2019t even know", "NTA. She knew who gave it to you. \n1. She was probably going to take it. \n2. Or break it.", "NTA. You told her no once which I'm assuming was nicely. She did not take the hint and she kept on pestering you so she needed to be told in a more firm more vocal way. You did nothing wrong", "NTA, that's just weird. There's absolutely no way that isn't weird.", "NTA.\n\nGuaranteed she would have \"wandered away\" and somehow \"it got lost\".\n\nShe just wanted to pretend like it was HER necklace.\n\nHis family are doing her absolutely no favors in perpetuating this fantasy and giving in to her. They need to back you up. She sounds... unstable. Like Wayne's crazy ex-GF in Wayne's World.", "NTA. No one has the right to demand your possessions. Once you said no, she should have immediately backed off. \n\nI can see why the family aren't people you want to spend time with. It also seems BF doesn't want to spend much time with them, either. Ignore what they say and listen to your BF \u2014 he actually cares for you.", "NTA. It's weird to demand to wear something that someone else is wearing. It's even weirder to continue to ask when you've been told no. It's your necklace and you aren't obliged to let anyone wear it. The ex was completely out of line.", "Nta\n\nShe was intentionally baiting you to be the bad guy.  She wants your boyfriend and wanted to make you feel insecure.  Ignore her and tell your boyfriend he needs to set his family straight when it comes to her and her intentions.  He's the one who is going to have to nip this in the bud.", "NTA\n\nThat necklace a very personal, meaningful gift from an important person. It'd be same as asking to try out someone's engament/wedding ring. And that girl was stirring shit intentionally.\n\nIt's funny how other people's posessions/money is sooooooooo easy to give/borrow to whiners. I bet your bf's mother wouldn't give hers.", "NTA\n\nWhether that girl knew the significance of the necklace or not, it's yours. You said no, she should have been a big girl and let it go. She kept pestering you, the only way for her to stop was for you to be a little tough. She couldn't take it and got a reason to complain about you. Something tells me she wasn't trying to be friendly with you, she just wanted to cause a scene purposely making you uncomfortable. She knows his family doesn't like you and was taking advantage of the situation. Please don't feel like T A, it's very clear she and his family will always be T A.", "NTA. This is right up there on par with *\"I love your dress you need to let me wear it now.\"* The entitlement is incredible. Of course you don't need to let her wear it. BF's mother and other family members are ridiculous for supporting that behavior.", "NTA, she weird", "NTA - your boyfriend\u2019s family has weird boundaries. I\u2019m glad you seem to have healthy ones. That\u2019s an odd request to try on someone\u2019s necklace that you don\u2019t know that well. Even my sister wouldn\u2019t have done that\u2026and we share the same blood.", "Nta, that's hella weird she would even ask to wear something on your body. Even more weird your bfs family is telling you to let her wear it. Me personally, I would never speak to any of them again.", "NTA.\n\nYou told her no but she kept asking.  She is not entitled to try on anybody's jewelry.  And her continuing to push the issue is disrespectful.\n\nGlad your bf had your back.  It would be helpful if he told this person to stop and back off.", "This person is unstable, and BF's family is encouraging her behavior.  If you try to have an actual wedding, be prepared for a lot of BS drama from her and his family.\n\nNTA", "NTA - what?? What a weird situation... i think I would have started laughing at her. Then if IL's started talking some shit, I would have loudly let everyone know that \"Yes, I am the bitch who doesn't allow others to try on my jewelry - go ahead, chat about it. It's fascinating I guess\"    what a odd bunch of people!!!!", "Absolutely NTA!\nAnd she had people cowing her to placate her because you wouldn't let her try on your necklace?!\nSeriously?!\nThat's totally weird.   She may have designs on your man, but does his family want this, or siding with her. \nYour man needs to take a hard stance.   End of.", "NTA\n\nI was spending time with some close friends one of whom recently got married. We were talking about her ring and she took it off to show us how the bands were connected. And then SHE told us we could try it on if we wanted.  But I never would have asked to try it on. \n\nFor this girl to ask not just once...which would have been odd but REPEATEDLY is creepy AF.", "NTA.  Who the fuck asks to try on someone else\u2019s jewelry right then and there.  I could totally see this girl walking off with OP\u2019s necklace and OP getting blamed for causing a scene trying to get it back.  For fucks sake.  \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc", "NTA Please don't put yourself under mental anguish anymore, I wouldn't attend any future family gatherings. Its clear they don't want you there, so why force yourself on them?", "NTA. You're under no obligation to let her wear it and at risk of not getting it back if you did. She's being totally out of order and childish reaction when she didn't get her way. \n\nI can kinda see why your bf didn't return her interest when she acts like this.", "NTA.  Not even a little.", "NTA. I'm not sure what sort of weird fantasy that girl was trying to play out, but you were right to tell her no. BFs mom is probably used to keeping the peace and doesn't realize how weird this is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's the issue here. He should have said  Friend, enough, I gave her that and it's for her and I do not want anyone else wearing it and what difference would it make what it looks like?  \n\nThink there's any chance she would have harmed the necklace if she'd gotten her hands on it?", "NTA. This girls request is just bizarre. You aren\u2019t close with her and she\u2019s asking you at a get together to remove your necklace so she can try it on? How on earth can his family think you are in the wrong \ud83d\ude12", "NTA... You were far more patient with her than I would have been. I would never ask someone if I could try on their necklace. I have asked to try on the ring of a VERY close friend but someone that I do not know well. Trying on anything they have would not be a question I would ask.", "Hopefully you learned for next time to just take the out. NTA", "NTA and what\u2019s up with all these families hating their kids SO\u2019s ?", "NTA.\n\n\"I love your necklace, LET ME WEAR IT\" is not a request that an adult makes to another adult at a public get together.  That's something a spoiled child would do.\n\nShe's definitely trying to get you out of the picture so your bf's family can pressure him into dating her instead.  Luckily, it sounds like he has more spine than that.  Hold your ground!", "NTA\n\nI have a feeling the sister told her who gave that to you and that\u2019s why she was so insistent to wear it", "NTA. It\u2019s a weird request but if she\u2019d simply accepted your answer it\u2019d be N A H.\n\nBut insisting on someone letting you try on a piece of sentimental jewellery? A bespoke piece of sentimental jewellery you\u2019re currently wearing?! NOPE NOPE NOPITY NOPE.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt's so unreasonable to ask you for that but it's telling how much his family doesn't like you by them totally cosigning that request.", "Off topic, but grandma's necklace sounds great, what a cool grandma!", "He did try to but his dad was making him help with the grill for most of the night and I hate the smell of it so I wasn\u2019t around him that much unless he came to me first. He told me he\u2019d text her but I didn\u2019t want to seem overdramatic about it", "now he has to do damage control with his family. I'd suggest telling them that the necklace is sentimental and a token of our relationship and it would be highly inappropriate for a girl who openly wants to be with him to have anything to do with it.  Secondly, he should tell friend that if she ever does anything like this again that he will go NC with her.  then finally, tell family that he won't be coming around if \"friend\" is here because she's harassing us both and they've done nothing but encourage it."]}
