You didn't hide the fact that you wanted to continue getting more.  If he doesn't like it - sucks to be him.\n\nYou know he doesn't like it, yet you still do it so it appears the body art wins this argument.  It's similar to the kids/no kids debate in couples.  If one person really wants to have kids and the other really does NOT want to have kids, you're looking at a couple that is fundamentally incompatible.  Same goes for you and your boyfriend - you are fundamentally incompatible so the best approach is to end this relationship now so you both can move on to people you are compatible with.", "NAH.

To be totally honest I didn\u2019t even need to read this to make my judgment. Any person, in a relationship or otherwise has no say or control over another persons autonomy. Ever. Period.

That's YOUR body. You get to decide how you would like to decorate your own body. You've been gracious to share yourself with him, he needs a reminder that he doesn't own you.

If that impacts your self-esteem, he\u2019s not the guy for you.", "Definitely not the A-hole, but a little inconsiderate. You absolutely have the autonomy to make choices about your own body. However, he also retains the right to end the relationship if he's no longer attracted, and this doesn't inherently make him an A-hole.", "I personally do not see tattoos, piercings, clothes, hairstyles etc as \"expressing\" anything, but hey, why would he get with a tattoo'd girl if he didn't like it? You are not the asshole. He is, though.", "NTA, get a couple ridiculous and just plain awful tattoos that are actually the temporary kind and see how bad of a reaction the Chad has", "Honestly NTA .... even if you haven't discussed tattoo inspo or anything ! \n\n\nIt's your body... you have the right to modify it ... your BF can tell his opinion ... but you should do what makes you happy ... whether getting a tatoo or not is purely your choice ...", "Ask yourself how you would feel if he did something to his body that you didnt like and had asked him not to do ?

You asked.", "NTA at all, but in my experience, regardless of gender, heavy tats and piercings = low IQ / boring people compensating for lack of competence or personality. \n\nI tolerate such people quietly, but don't respect them, and never hire them. I feel the same about them as I do about Andrew Tate guys who spend absurd sums on luxury watches and cars.", "NAH. If I wanted to get an ugly-ass hair cut and my girlfriend didn\u2019t want me to, tough luck it\u2019s my own body. Of course after doing that I would expect the relationship to quickly decline, since simply *not getting an ugly-ass haircut* isn\u2019t that hard for me to do and it would keep her happy and attracted to me, and I\u2019m deciding to say \u201cfuck that I don\u2019t care I\u2019m doing it anyway\u201d.\n\nTo me piercings don\u2019t make somebody less attractive, they can make the person distinctly not-attractive. Some of them are fine, belly button piercings are cute, ear piercings are fine. Nose piercings are bad, eyebrow/etc piercings are a complete and total dealbreaker. If I was with a girl who was completely fine with having me be completely unattracted to her, I would be extremely disappointed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
