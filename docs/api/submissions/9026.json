{"id": 9026, "submission_id": "10slzuv", "title": "AITA for kicking my brother out because he is friends with my ex?", "selftext": "This is a tough one for me. Ask for info. I have 3 children with my ex and after I had our youngest, I left. The relationship was terrible, he was lazy as all fuck and wouldn't work but spent my money, treated me like garbage, etc. So when he left me in the hospital for a week after I had our son and took all my money with him so he could buy weed and cigarettes while staying home playing video games, that was the final straw. Bonus points for him taking my son fresh out of the ICU in the hospital to go meet his mistress (I was unaware about her at that time because they were \"just friends\"). I hate him with every ounce of my being and it's no secret. That hatred spiraled out of control when he stopped taking the kids at all for visitation about a year and a half later, simply because I started dating someone new. He has seen the kids 1-2 times a year since 2017 and only when his mother has them. There's always 6-7 months between seeing them and no contact between us. \n\nNow when I was with my ex, my brother and him got really close. To a point where they would take off for hours on end, every single day, and leave me with the full responsibility of the kids (we had two at that time, a newborn and a 2yo) and everything else. It caused fights always and I would get laughed at for being \"dramatic\". Since him and I split, him and my brother have remained close. Well, back 3 months ago my brother needed a place to stay 2 days a week for work and since his job is 5 minutes from my place he had been staying with me. It got to a point where he brings up my ex almost every single time he is at my house.\n\nThe latest issue however is the fact that my ex has my brother convinced that I am keeping the kids from him. Whenever I say that's not true and say that he doesn't want them or answer my texts, my brother retorts with \"you need to try harder, those kids need both parents\". I'm done being expected to try harder in every aspect of life, so these 'try harder\" comments have started making my blood boil. Especially when he talks about it in front of the kids. I've told him to stop mentioning that man's name in my house at all because I was done with the scolding every single day for a situation that he has no business meddling in and usually he won't stop. So when he came here yesterday and started in about how my ex was so depressed and blah blah because he has no one, I told him again to shut up. I don't care if my ex is depressed, to be quite honest. He should be, considering how much of a dead beat he is. It should eat at him and I'm glad it does. But my brother wouldn't stop bringing it up so I just told him to leave and that he's not welcome back here. He goes on to say \"Are you serious? You're kicking me out over words? Knowing I can't get to work unless I'm here? That's fucked up.\" AITA?", "created_utc": 1675435483, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10slzuv/aita_for_kicking_my_brother_out_because_he_is/", "score": 283, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
