You never want to throw yourself in the deep end with exposure therapy. You want to take it nice and slow. You\u2019ve also done all you can to be accommodating in the past and you\u2019ve gone above and beyond in my opinion! You decided that you didn\u2019t want to be responsible for her anymore and you have every right to decide that!

She might be so early in her disorder that she cannot fathom logically that if she always has an attack at a club, it's likely it would happen this time aswell.\n\nIt's also common for a person with a panic disorder/anxiety disorder to refuse to think about panic attacks, even for long enough to figure out what triggers them. Having a panic attack is scary and feels like a total loss of control, you genuinely feel like you are going to die. And since they are relatively random untill you figure out your triggers, people can try to manage the attacks by avoiding thinking about them as a magical thinking defence mechanism.

Sounds nothing like any panic attack I've ever had not witnessed.\n\nIt's not impossible, but it's vanishingly unlikely, that this, particularly as a repeated behavior, would qualify as a panic attack.\n\nThis person likes to go out, and then likes to be babyed in the smoking area. It's literally the likely goal of the entire adventure.\n\nI've never met someone who has panic attacks. Every time they do a particular thing who is in actively in love with doing that particular thing again and again.\n\nPanic attacks just aren't attractive to the person that has them."]}
