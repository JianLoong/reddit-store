One of my friends, we\u2019ll call her A suggested that we go clubbing. \n(All of us are 21)\n\nI love going clubbing, I love being that environment (I know some people don\u2019t) and I was more than happy to go along with this plan. However, the problem is that whenever I go clubbing with A she tends to have panic attacks within about twenty minutes of being there and I have to sit in the smoking area for most of the night. \n\nI didn\u2019t mind doing this the first couple of times but after awhile it gets to be not much fun at all. And I know she\u2019s not having fun either but it\u2019s her choice to go to the club. \n\nI suggested instead that we could stay in as a group and drink and watch a movie or something instead but A was insistent that we go out. Everyone else was totally fine with not going out as well.  I messaged her privately a couple of days ago to ask if she was sure she wanted to go out and she said yes. I maybe slightly cruelly told her that if she had a panic attack then I wouldn\u2019t help her with it. It was her choice to go out and she needs to deal with it herself. \n\nI should also add that we live quite remotely, it takes about 35 mins to get to the club that we were going to. Within half an hour, A was overwhelmed and asked if I would go outside with her. I reluctantly agreed and sat outside for about twenty minutes. I then asked if she wanted to go back inside and she asked if we could go home. I told her that I could order a taxi to take her home but I wanted to stay. She didn\u2019t want to go home on her own so she came back into the club with me. About ten minutes later she started getting overwhelmed again. She asked me to go outside and I refused. \n\nShe spent the rest of the night in the smoking area, I regularly went and checked on her, texted her throughout the night and offered to get her a taxi home. It\u2019s not a massive club so she knew where we were at all times. Quite a few of our mutual friends were there so there was a lot of people she could\u2019ve gone to if she felt unsafe. She was relatively sober as well. \n\nI know she\u2019s really mad at me now but I just couldn\u2019t handle going home that early or spending the night outside.

You are not her babysitter. She should be responsible enough to come to a bar (edit:club)", "NTA. Your friend needs to learn her limits. Everyone shouldn\u2019t have to accommodate her panic attacks, or be expected to change plans for her.", "NTA, she knows this situation is not one she is comfortable in and continues trying to make it work.

Part of handling mental health issues is finding ways to deal with triggers, and ruining experiences for everyone else with her choices is not an acceptable response.", "NTA. You offered many alternatives and she didn't accept. She is grown. You did fine.", "NTA, I think enough is enough. It is not fair to you. Why are you the only one also? Maybe you guys could take turns babysitting her. But, if she only wants you, then she should have accepted staying in when you and everyone offered that.", "Nta..shes the one who insisted this even though everyone else was ok to stay in, and she did so knowing it triggers panic attacks.  From that point on she is not your problem.  You did more than you had to imo, she's an adult and you're not her parent.", "NTA \n\n\"I know she\u2019s really mad at me now but I just couldn\u2019t handle going home that early or spending the night outside.

If she gives you any grief, tell her that was it.  She doesn't get to go clubbing with you anymore.  Stick to your guns.", "NTA you warned her what would happen.", "How old is she? Because she knows how she reacts to going to the club. She insists on going and then expect you to go home with her after she panicks. That is the behaviour of a child. And she is not a child anymore. So it is time she grows up and takes responsibility for her own decisions and actions. \n\n\n NTA.", "NTA. She knew she would get overwhelmed but wanted to go anyway.

You are not her comfort person and you warned her.", "NTA you did what a friend is should do by trying to prevent the situation, offering a solution (taxi), and making sure she wasn\u2019t abducted (checking on her). But you\u2019re not her keeper and she\u2019s the AH for expecting you to be.", "NTA    as someone who has panic attacks, I know it's my responsibility to keep myself away from situations that will set me off. This means if going to a club sets me off, I either don't go at all, or that I make arrangements to go home if I need too.Your friend needs to get their act together. \n\nWe can't always predict when, or what situation will cause one, but it is our responsibility to try to mitigate these situations. \n\nLet her be mad, you didn't do anything wrong, if she can't figure that out it's her problem.", "NTA at all, all I will say is going forward I would refuse to go out with her unless you\u2019re prepared to leave with her (which again you\u2019re not at all obligated to do), sometimes I overthink but personally I don\u2019t like the idea of somebody actively in mental distress taking a taxi alone 30 minutes away into a remote area.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I suffer from severe panic attacks and I learned early on that if something triggers you, avoid it! Yes exposure therapy can be good for people with anxiety and panic attacks but the exposure needs to be done in a planned out controlled way, you can't just throw yourself into a situation you know is gonna make you panic and hope for the best. \n\nIt's not like you completely abandoned her, you kept an eye out and kept checking up on her. Sometimes that's all you can do. \n\nUltimately she put herself in that situation and she needs to learn her limits, no one can decide her limits for her.", "NTA...She can't handle the environment and still hasn't found a way to cope. You all agreed to do something more relaxing. You' tried other solutions. She will be fine.", "NTA. Your friend needs to learn to be responsible for her own choices. Her wishing the panic attacks away and pushing her own limits too far clearly isn't working (and why would it?), she needs help to deal with the underlying issues that cause them. If she cannot afford to talk to a professional about it, there is a lot of free content on YT that might get her started to figure out what causes this and how to help herself get started on her inner healing process.  \n\n\nI wish you both the best. You sound like a very good friend.", "NTA. She\u2019s absolutely doing all of this intentionally to control and manipulate you. I would take a closer look at this friendship if I were you.", "NTA. I sometimes get panic attacks in crowded places, and because of that, I typically DON\u2019T GO TO CLUBS. You offered alternatives that she may be more comfortable with and she declined.\n\nYou tried to support her as best you could whilst also having your own night out, and that\u2019s fine. You didn\u2019t have to do even that much after you gave her the chances to opt out. \n\nIt\u2019s great if your friends can support you, but you can\u2019t do literally nothing to address your known mental health issues and then complain that nobody\u2019s helping you.", "NTA. She needs to seek professional help with her anxiety, not keep abusing whoever is most willing to put up with it as her support dog.", "NTA - she insisted on going out, and you made it clear that you thought she wasn't upto it due to these attacks, she ignored that and thought you'd crumble and look after her again  -you checked in on her, you did all you could do tbh", "NTA. You're not her emotional support animal.", "^^^THIS^^^!!!!", "21", "NTA \n\nSHE IS TA \n\nAlso she either needs to address her issues or at least acknowledge that you're literally foregoing your night every fucking time for her \n\nThis isn't a once a while thing \n\nAbsolute bs she expects you to do this, she's a grown up who needs to be accountable for her own actions, clearly clubbing isn't for her atm\n\nIf anything if she doesn't apologize to you (and sounds like she was mad at you) I wouldn't even be friends with someone like this", "Nta. Expecting this then getting angry im makes her an ah", "NTA and I\u2019m the one who\u2019s going to throw the plot twist out there - she\u2019s doing it on purpose. Specifically to OP. Only OP is the one she goes to when panic attacks happen? Despite the friend group all knowing about her attacks? She consistently lied about being ok with the venue - even when given options of being a part of the group in a home setting. Something stinks and it\u2019s definitely fishy.", "Nta. She sounds like she's doing this for attention. Especially when alternatives were offered.", "NTA - she's using you as her own personal emotional support animal. That's unfair to you in so many ways. You have every right to enjoy your time without babysitting her in a situation you both knew would end this way.", "NTA\n\nI'm not a bar scene person, either. I also get panic attacks (not frequent anymore, after years of therapy).\n\nBut managing my own anxiety is part of my responsibility. So is A's management of her panic attacks.\n\nYou're also her friend, not her therapist or a support animal. \n\nYou're all young. Perhaps A feels embarrassed to tell others about her panic attacks, or doesn't find others as calming as you. But it is her responsibility to know her triggers and avoid them.\n\nIf you can, suggest she see a therapist and start seeking professional help for her panic attacks.\n\nI understand being young and wanting to \"keep pace\" with party friends. Perhaps reassuring her she doesn't have to force herself to party might help.\n\nYou drew a boundary, enforced it, and still kept making sure A could get home safe.\n\nThat's being as good a friend as you can be while still being true to yourself.\n\nA needs to deal with her feelings like an adult, which you all are. It does get easier with experience, though.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you did everything you could to support her short of just ruining your own evening, too.\n\nI get moments where I'm overwhelmed or exhausted. (Migraine, anxiety, fill in the blank. I love clubs and parties, and sometimes that doesn't go well.)\nI plan ahead.\nI would HATE to ruin someone else's evening over it. (I got a ride home last night so my sweetie didn't have to bail on NYE, or make an extra trip.)", "Intentionally putting herself into unnecessary situations she knows will trigger her is self-harming behavior, too. No one should be supporting that."]}
