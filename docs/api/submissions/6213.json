One of my friends, we\u2019ll call her A suggested that we go clubbing. \n(All of us are 21)\n\nI love going clubbing, I love being that environment (I know some people don\u2019t) and I was more than happy to go along with this plan. However, the problem is that whenever I go clubbing with A she tends to have panic attacks within about twenty minutes of being there and I have to sit in the smoking area for most of the night. \n\nI didn\u2019t mind doing this the first couple of times but after awhile it gets to be not much fun at all. And I know she\u2019s not having fun either but it\u2019s her choice to go to the club. \n\nI suggested instead that we could stay in as a group and drink and watch a movie or something instead but A was insistent that we go out. Everyone else was totally fine with not going out as well.  I messaged her privately a couple of days ago to ask if she was sure she wanted to go out and she said yes. I maybe slightly cruelly told her that if she had a panic attack then I wouldn\u2019t help her with it. It was her choice to go out and she needs to deal with it herself. \n\nI should also add that we live quite remotely, it takes about 35 mins to get to the club that we were going to. Within half an hour, A was overwhelmed and asked if I would go outside with her. I reluctantly agreed and sat outside for about twenty minutes. I then asked if she wanted to go back inside and she asked if we could go home. I told her that I could order a taxi to take her home but I wanted to stay. She didn\u2019t want to go home on her own so she came back into the club with me. About ten minutes later she started getting overwhelmed again. She asked me to go outside and I refused. \n\nShe spent the rest of the night in the smoking area, I regularly went and checked on her, texted her throughout the night and offered to get her a taxi home. It\u2019s not a massive club so she knew where we were at all times. Quite a few of our mutual friends were there so there was a lot of people she could\u2019ve gone to if she felt unsafe. She was relatively sober as well. \n\nI know she\u2019s really mad at me now but I just couldn\u2019t handle going home that early or spending the night outside. AITA?\n\nEdit: a few people have asked why I\u2019m normally the one who stays with her during her panic attacks. As someone who experiences them myself, I know how awful it can be to go through them alone so as fed up as it as I am, I stick with her. But I believe there\u2019s a point where if you\u2019re forcing yourself into a situation which triggers you then your friends have to take a step back.", "created_utc": 1672594006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100oe32/aita_for_not_staying_with_my_friend_during_her/", "score": 2237, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Having a panic attack is scary and feels like a total loss of control, you genuinely feel like you are going to die.

I've tried, unsuccessfully, to put myself into situations to try to overcome it, but it just doesn't work because there is NO WAY for me to turn off my reaction to overstimulation. Sometimes it causes a panic attack. Sometimes it can cause meltdowns. But it is directly linked to my autism and sensory processing issues. \n\nJust a theory because this doesn't sound like typical panic attacks. My panic attacks usually result in long term paranoia surrounding whatever issue caused that particular panic attack, eg my bf caused me to almost fall out of my wheelchair onto a busy parking lot and I refuse to let him wheel me anywhere near that area because I will start hyperventilating and panicking again when nearby even if I'm not actually planning to cross there. Not to say that it's the same for everyone, but I definitely wouldn't keep putting myself in the sensory hellscape that is a nightclub, even for exposure reasons.\n\nEither way, you're NTA. You can't be expected to take care of her and miss out because she INSISTED you go to the nightclub even though everyone was fine with staying in and celebrating/chilling out at home.", "NTA \n\nYou supported her the best you could in that situation. If you have panic attacks, it is important to recognize when and how they occur. It should be clear to her at this point that she cannot go clubbing without panic attacks.

You have done your duty as her friend.", "NTA. for some reason i attract these people. one time i went to a gerard way concert with my friend, and we left just as the meet and greet line started to form. my friend was super anxious so i agreed to go home, just repeatedly reassuring myself that im a very good person", "Regardless of whether your friend is having genuine panic attacks or is simply wanting attention, it is still not your obligation to sit there with her (especially if this is encouraging her not to face the issue). It\u2019s absolutely possible she is in denial and wants to do all the \u201cnormal\u201d things people her age do. But there comes a time when she needs to accept she can\u2019t do everything she wants to and it seems this is the time. She has to address the anxiety she may be feeling (or her need for attention, if that\u2019s the case here) with a professional. And she also needs to own her behaviours and actions. She knows she will very likely have a panic attack at a club and she still chooses to go even though you and the rest of your friends don\u2019t mind doing something else.

She could have gone home.

Again, NTA, and, if you can, I\u2019d limit these kinds of outings with her, or phase out the friendship altogether. Whether she\u2019s an emotional leech or has an unhealthy support attachment to you, it\u2019s going to do harm to you the longer this goes on.", "NTA. Stop inviting her when you go clubbing.

And you checked in on her throughout the night, it\u2019s not like you ditched her. You are an amazing friend and A is TA for not realizing that.", "NTA, there comes a certain point where you need to put yourself first. She shouldn't be going clubbing if she's having these issues", "NTA. You aren\u2019t her prop, you need to live your life too.", "NTA. She k ew this might happen. She needs to learn to deal with them on her own. I have panic attacks. When they first started happening, I though I was dying. I remember one lasting an entire night. When morning came, I was begging people to take me to the hospital because I thought I was having a heart attack. \n\nNow, I get mildly annoyed when one comes on because I know I have to go through my process of dealing with it. It sucks, but I can work through it and come out unscathed after the event. \n\nYou are doing  a sweet thing, but she can't rely on you forever.", "NTA. This may sound harsh but next time don't invite her to the club. It's not in her best interests to be there.", "NTA. I have some issues with anxiety. Sometimes I get them when doing something with the family or friends. Just feels like I'm having a heart attack or like I'm going to break down or pass out from my heart rate rising very high really fast and hyperventilating.\n\nI don't ask them to stop doing what they are doing or stop having fun. I excuse myself from the activity and ask them them if in 15 minutes im not back to please do a quick check on me (in case I do pass out or actually have a heart attack). \n\nThey know the drill at this point that I'm all good and it's just my anxiety.  That I'm doing my ritual to calm myself down. Moving my fingers and toes and stretching just to bring myself back down. Some breathing exercises, etc.\n\nI don't expect them to stop what they are doing because I'm panicking. It's not sensible. \n\nShe can't expect you to stop doing your thing. If she Needs medical help then she should get ig.", "If I know a trigger place, I\u2019m not returning - at least without coping mechanisms or medication. She probably just doesn\u2019t want to feel left out and she might be trying to get through it by exposure? Hard to say. You\u2019re trying to be supportive and she\u2019s trying to face a fear. But she needs professional support through.", "NTA - It seems that it\u2019s a pattern that she keeps getting panic attacks every time she goes to the club, so why would she still agree to going? It\u2019s unfair for everyone else, especially you, because you all should be having fun, not babysitting her.", "NTA. Next time she suggests going to the club with you, decline.", "It\u2019s like someone who hates scary movies but insists that they watch a scary movie. Then 10 minutes in they want to leave the theater and demands everyone leave with them.", "Agreed, she also most likely not keep going.", "I am an HSP (highly sensitive person), it\u2019s not a medical term, but I am so glad that someone put it together so I can talk about how I feel with better words, because for a long time I couldn\u2019t explain how I was feeling or what I was experiencing.\n\nI used to love going to the movies. I would go every week if I could. But then, right around when 3D movies came out, I would start to sweat, feel dizzy, my heart would race, sometimes I would even throw up. If I stepped outside, within 5- 10 minutes I was fine. It was always awkward with whoever I went with.\n\nAdding to the confusion, this never happened at old theaters/art houses.\n\nIt took me so many ruined movies to finally piece together that the newer theaters with bigger, brighter screens and larger sounds were too much for me. I have anxiety/panic attacks too and I have medication, but it doesn\u2019t help or I take a bigger dose and I am ready to doze off. I never go to the movies anymore and have to wait for streaming, even for movies I am very excited about.\n\nIt is possible that she loves to go out and be with friends, but that the club is too much for her. She may not even have connected it yet.\n\nIn any case, roping in a friend for support, once, twice sure. But since it happens so often and her friend is not into it and set a boundary that they would not sit with her, that OP is NTA.", "We've reached the point of gatekeeping subjective experiences. Amazing.", "If she were having actual panic attacks, she would not under any circumstances insist on exposing herself to the very thing that tiggers her panic attacks over and over and over again. \n\nLiterally makes no sense.", "NTA\n\n A needs to realize that her mental health is stopping you from having fun. You went above and beyond because not only did you let her know in advance that she would need to deal with it on her own, you also offered many solutions to the situation. OP you sound Like a great friend and I wish you the best in your future.", "NTA, im not sure why she would continue going to the club when she knows she just gets overwhelmed. You even offered alternatives and she declined.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who has anxiety and panic disorder, if I knowingly put myself in a triggering situation, I do not expect anyone to deal with my issues. Sometimes we do it to see if this time it will be better, but we can\u2019t make that anyone else\u2019s problem  Alternatives were offered before you all went out, she said she wanted to put herself into a situation she knows triggers her. She can\u2019t expect people to put their lives and their fun on hold for her when she did that.  I feel bad she was  overstimulated and panicking, but this is why you don\u2019t ignore your triggers and you get help to decrease their effect on  you", "NTA\n\nWhile it's true panic attacks are absolutely terrible and horrific to go through, you gave her multiple options and did everything you could to make this night out as good as possible for her. \n\nYou offered to stay in, you told her in advance that you wouldn't sit with her, and then you did anyway the first time. You offer to call her a cab. You checked on her multiple times throughout the night. You did your due diligence, and it's up to her to be a responsible adult and either accept one of your solutions, deal with her panic attacks alone,  or not go out at all.", "NTA. You tried multiple times to talk her out of our knowing how she is and you offered multiple times to get her a taxi so she could go home.  Sounds like she just wants more attention rather than actually having anxiety.  I suffer from extreme social anxiety and her behavior just isn't indicative of true anxiety.", "NAH I get the impression she is really trying to overcome it, but you are not solely responsible for her either. You said \u201cI know she\u2019s really mad at me now.\u201d Can you elaborate more on that? Did she act mad or say something? Or are you just feeling guilty?", "NTA and clubbing is overrated af", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure I agree that A is faking panic attacks or the degree to which she is experiencing anxiety or overstimulation like some have commented. But she is an adult and needs to be responsible for her own self care. \n\nOP, you did the right thing, still checking in on her and giving other options for hanging out and providing a reasonable out, the taxi home, from the situation. It sounds like maybe she wants to be a part of the group and do things that her friends like doing, regardless of the impact it has on her. But she needs therapy rather than just forcing herself into it, either to handle situations that cause panic attacks or the root behind what is going on.", "Totally! NTA. She keeps putting herself in the same situation expecting different results. You also tried to convince her to stay in that you would all celebrate with a night in and she was the one who insisted on going out.", "Likely, she specifically wants to get OP alone and taking care of her seems to be the goal.", "Whatever she's up to she needs to stop putting a damper on everyone else's good time. That kind of thing would get real old real fast. I would feel bad for bringing everyone down and just stay home, knowing what was going to happen.", "NTA. When I party, I get nauseated and get sick. My friends use leave with me, I felt awful! Now I make adjustments (don\u2019t drink as much, take an anti nausea pill/only go if I know I will be okay solo). If she wants to keep triggering it, she needs to come prepared and with a plan on dealing with it without impacting the group.", "Nta....don't invite her next time. That may sound harsh and cruel but, you deserve to enjoy your night out and not have to babysit her. She knows she's going to have multiple panic attacks yet chose to go, then wants you to constantly sit with her. That's not fair to you. Especially since you're there with several other people, they could have sat with her too, taken turns so no one is missing too much fun time. But also, this sounds like total manipulation. She KNOWS she's going to vet overwhelmed, but goes anyway, then INSISTS you, just you, spend all your time sitting with her, or leaving early to sit with her. Sounds like she didn't want to stay home because then everyone would be there as well, but if she could go out with you guys, then convince you to leave, it would be just you two. Does she have \"panic attacks\" any other place than the club or when you're out with friends together? Or is it only during those times? Because honestly, I'd be surprised if she has these attacks any other time. I'm betting they only happen when either you're out with friends together or you're out with friends without her and she calls so you'll leave and go sit with her.", "NTA You gave your friend lots of reasonable options for managing her mental health. Your friend has a responsibility to herself first before she makes her mental health other people\u2019s problem.", "I was ready to say you wet AH based on the title but after reading say NTA. She had warning, she knows her triggers. At this point I\u2019d say she\u2019s being manipulative and you need to step back. It isn\u2019t fair for one friend to always be \u201cthe parent\u201d of the group either", "NTA, but you're definitely stupid. Why tf you keep going to the club with her??? Also, and I don't like to judge, but I've got some alarm bells going off at the idea of someone who legitimately deals with anxiety issues continuing to put herself in a situation where she knows she's going to melt down. You sure she's not just dramatic?", "I have anxiety too, and I deal perfectly fine on my own. NTA. Besides, you warned her.", "NTA. I get panic attacks. Best thing to do is go home or somewhere familiar and safe. She refused every optione except you being her human teddy bearlr", "I'm actually not sure about this. When you had a car accident for example and get a panic attack every time after you sit behind the steering wheel, the only way to overcome this panic is to put yourself in exactly that situation that overwhelms you and just act until it becomes a normal situation to you again. The more you go out of that situation after having panic to calm down again, the more fear you'll build up.\n\nFear is a basic feeling. There is one thing all feelings have in common: they abate after some time. First they can increase, then they will stay on the same level for a while but eventually you will feel them much weaker and they'll slowly fade. It's like buying a new album of your favorite band: As soon as you bought it you will be incredibly happy. For the next two days you'll be still pretty happy but not as much as on your first day. After a while you won't care anymore, you have that CD for a few years now and sure you still like many songs on it and maybe it even has sentimental value but you probably won't feel overwhelmed with luck anymore when you think about it.\n\nThe way A handles it is probably not the best but I feel a lot of respect for people who really want and try to overcome their fears.\nAnd yes, I had panic attacks too. I'm hella scared of driving because my grandfather got hit by a car and died in a hospital (I don't want to be responsible for other people's suffering) and before two of my job interviews I had a panic attack at the hotel the nights before but still forced myself to go.", "Okay, so this is the first time I am hearing this from another person.\n\nI also love going to the movies (I don't as much as I want to tho) but it has happened twice. Exactly as you described, sweating, dizziness, I actually threw up in the hallway the first time.\n\nBut I don't have panic attacks and don't think I have anxiety (at least not more than anyone else)\n\nMaby there is another possible trigger/reason?\n\nAnyways I am kinda glad I am not the only one who experiences dizziness etc in cinemas, but used not to", "I think that point was once OP had explicitly stated they wouldn't help with any panic attacks and that help was still expected. Prior to that explicit communication, it's possible the friend had no idea OP didn't enjoy their routine (no matter how obvious others may think it is) but once it was stated clearly, the friend became the AH for making plans on the assumption that OP would give up their night.", "Accommodations: making a house party with chill vibe so she can be comftarble and not have panic attacks. \n\nNot Accomodations: going to the exect situation that casues panic attacks then immediately go home because she had panic attacks. \n\nShe was offered very reasonable accommodation and choose to skip on it. \nI don't know why she's so adamant on going into panic attacks, when all her friends were fine with a house party.\nNTA.", "NTA\nShe should know her limits and work within them. She can't expect to have a crutch all her life and it's not your responsibility. It's your life and time to have fun and she had the opportunity to not go clubbing. Maybe next time bring her a paper bag to breathe into? Does that trick work?", "Long term panic attack sufferer here, you are most definitely NTA.\nIt's ludicrous that she pushed to go clubbing when she knew she'd probably have an attack.\n\nShe's acting incredibly entitled to expect you to give up yet another night for her, when she's taking no ownership of her condition.\n\nDon't set yourself on fire to keep other people warm. x", "NTA you definitely didn\u2019t just ditch her, but it\u2019s kind of unfair that she wanted to bring your night down and have you drop everything to take care of her. She\u2019s an adult so she could have called an Uber to go home and relax.", "NTA. I have panic attacks and react similar to your friend in loud situations. I started having them as a teenager so it was parties that I found having panic attacks within 20 minutes. Once I figured out the trigger, loud noises and lights from the party, I learned to stay away from parties and similar events.  I was a teenager and was able to figure out if something keeps giving you a panic attack, don't go. There's some things I will never go to cause of my history with panic attacks. No college parties, no bars, no concerts. She's 21, she needs to realize that clubbing triggers her panic attacks and the best option is to not go to clubs. Purposely triggering her panic attacks is kinda sad but a bit of a red flag that she might not be a good friend.", "NTA", "Nta. She brought this on herself and then refused to go home.", "Are you talking from experience or medical knowledge?", "Aye, that's true enough!", "I have both, and I agree. \nPanic attack will probably do whatever the friend is suggesting.  Sensory issue will probably be fine and have prefences.", "NTA. Speaking from personal experience. She\u2019s probably just hungry. This happens to so many girls.", "You set up boundaries for your trip\u2026 she broke them . NTA", "NTA I suffer the same anxiety on nights out and I would just say to friends go out and enjoy and we will catch up for a coffee or spa day at another time. She needs to accept her limitations.", "I don't think you're TA. I think your friend is in need of a therapist, though. I have some issues like this, getting overwhelmed in crowds and with lots of different noises bombarding me, and sometimes it causes me to shut down, cry, or just stressed and mad. But it's my responsibility to deal with it, no one else's. My partner and some of my friends are aware and keen to help, and I'm grateful for their help, but I would never expect or demand that of any of them.\n\nYour friend is putting her mental health issues on you, and frankly that sounds like a bad friend imo", "NTA \n\nShe purposely put herself in a situation that she knew would trigger a panic attack. That is on her and you aren't obligated to miss out on fun because of her choices, particularly when she does this regularly.", "Not sure why this was downvoted \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Never underestimate the power of masking. You try your absolute hardest you fit in and internally attack yourself if you don't manage. I'd guess she won't stop trying because she wants to fit in. She probably feels like she's stopping her friends having fun clubbing, etc also."]}
