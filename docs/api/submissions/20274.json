I have kind of integrated into her friend group(five other girls not including us) although I\u2019m not as close with them as they are with each other, which makes sense seeing as how they\u2019ve known each other a bit longer.\n\nI was recently on a first date with a woman that I\u2019ve liked for a bit (27f). We were having coffee at a cafe, and all of a sudden, my friend walks up to us and says hi. Not a big deal, I know she comes here a lot and I introduced them, my friend is super nice to my date. At this point, I hadn\u2019t told my friend this was a date. She knows I\u2019ve dated women in the past, but I wasn\u2019t expecting her to realize this was a date because it could very well have just been a friend. Then she asks if she can join us and starts to pull up a chair. \n\nMy date is visibly thrown off by this, as am I, and so I say \u201coh I\u2019m sorry but (date\u2019s name) and I are on a date right now. I\u2019ll see you later, though!\u201d\n\nMy friend says \u201coh, I don\u2019t mind!\u201d and sits. \n\nI reiterate, more clearly \u201cI\u2019d love to hang out another time but right now I\u2019d like for it to just be (date\u2019s name) and I\u201d\n\nShe says ok and leaves. I thought that was the end of it, not at all a big deal, I don\u2019t expect her to automatically know who I am or am not on a date with. \n\nI get a call from a different girl in the friend group that night, who tells me that my friend called her and was pissed off about earlier, so I immediately call my friend and ask if we can talk. She says it was rude of me to brush her off, it wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal to join us, and her other gay friend lets her hang out with him and his boyfriend all the time (this friend is not a part of the friend group, I have never met him). This gets to me a little because I feel like the two situations are only being compared because her friend and I are both not straight. I tell her that because it was a date, it\u2019s different and that she can\u2019t expect to join me on a first date. She keeps arguing, and finally I get fed up and snap at her \u201cbe fucking honest, if I was on a date with a guy you would have taken no for an answer and not had a problem\u201d and then hang up. \n\nShe has not talked to me since then, but she told the entire friend group and they are now split. I know this bc the friend who first told me that she was pissed off as well as one other girl messaged me individually to let me know what was going on and that they\u2019re sorry about what happened. \n\nThe messages from the people on my friend\u2019s (maybe former friend, idk) side are making me second guess myself, I do get that I snapped at her on the phone and was rude at the end of our conversation.

And it's nothing like hanging with an established couple - you were on a first/early date with a new love interest.", "NTA at all; the way she compared you to her gay friend absolutely says it all.

You handled it perfectly.", "NTA for your response on the phone. \n\nShe was being selfish and didn't seem open to your perspective. And to say her male gay friend is cool with it is ridiculous. So cause you're both on a same sex date the same rules apply to either of you? That's a dumb excuse.", "I'm sorry, no. NTA.\n\nYou handled it maturely, and instead of the situation being over and done with as it should have been, she kept it going by spreading it to other people. \n\nThat's massively immature. I'm bisexual and have dated men AND women, and I would have been very put off by someone thinking they could crash my date after I've made the situation clear that she's not welcome. \n\nNTA. And it's infuriating that your friends are split, she is very clearly in the wrong.", "NTA\n\nYou called your friend out on her bullshit and she couldn't take it like an adult.", "NTA. Even if you hadn't been on a date with the woman at your table, it is still rude to crash someone else's table without being invited to sit with them.  You were gentle but firm and she refused to take no for an answer.", "You were correct IMO in your assessment that the friend wouldn't have crashed your date if you'd been sitting with a man. It was disrespectful of her when you alerted her you were indeed on a date to not remove herself; dismissive and rude of her.\n\nI'm gonna say NTA cuz I get why you lost your temper with her, especially her having someone else play social secretary to complain to you rather than stepping up and speaking to you herself in the first place. \n\nYou've probably lost them as a friend, but that's not necessarily a negative if they're biphobic which it seems to me they are. They're certainly shit at communication.", "NTA. The last comment isn\u2019t what makes you an asshole, it\u2019s something she really needed to separate and clearly couldn\u2019t grasp it wasn\u2019t two girls who are friends catching up and hanging out even when you verbalized it was specifically a date. Because you\u2019re quite correct. You made it crystal clear she was invading on a dating situation and it was socially rude as fuck. The girl you were on a date with had a right to be taken aback because she at this point isn\u2019t sure and is asking herself this is someone you\u2019ve been involved with who\u2019s being messy, or just a friend acquaintance? Why aren\u2019t they getting the hint?\n\nHad you been sitting on a hetero date with a man, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d have even come up and done much besides quickly say hello and leave. And that had she stuck around it would have come off as some of the most literally insane pick-me girl shit to pull and would have definitely weirded out the guy so much it\u2019s not funny. She can\u2019t separate you having coffee with another female as anything besides meeting with a friend the way she would meet with you and the firmness you had to verbalize screams it because literally no one is that socially stupid or would be cool with you doing that to her on a first date.", "NTA - you're right ; and, why would anyone want to be a 3rd wheel??", "NTA. It was a first date. She should have excused herself without needing to be given a hint. You are right to be suspicious about the comparison with a gay couple because there's no other connection. Once people are actually boyfriends/girlfriends, it's normal for them to hang out with others, but even then they'd probably not want someone barging in on an official date.", "Corporate Life Lesson 101.

People get angry when you call them out on their crap and lack of manners and common sense. Regardless of who you were dating, asking someone to leave should have only needed to be done once.", "I don\u2019t think you were being homophobic. It sounds like your friend is actually biphobic if she would\u2019ve likely left you alone with a man but has a weird thing about thinking it\u2019s fine to tag along just because other gay friends let her. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly weird to invite yourself on someone else\u2019s date, and it is next level to not leave after being told once. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.  It sounds as if the friend doesn\u2019t understand the difference between hanging out with an established couple vs. hanging out with two people who are on a first date.  Maybe \u201cfirst date\u201d didn\u2019t penetrate her brain when she heard it.  But I also think that what you said on the phone may have some truth to it.  Had you need out with a guy, I think she would have heard and understood the word \u201cdate\u201d more clearly.  She saw two women sitting together and decided it would be fine have a coffee klatch.", "NTA. You handled this well!", "NTA That was so blatantly rude.", "NTA.   She got really entitled and pushy, didn't she?  No, you're not wrong for thinking she can't invite herself into your date.", "NTA  \n\n\nSimply apologize for hanging up on her but stand your ground on everything else. She was in the wrong to just insert herself regardless if you were on a date.   \n\n\nShe is also clueless when her response was \"oh I dont mind\" when she was told you were on a date....and not just a date...a first date!!", "NTA but bordering on ESH.  You were fine until that last comment.  It was completely unnecessary and rude.  That having been said, it sounds like you lost patience after you tried repeatedly to explain your boundaries and she refused to accept them.", "You summarize by asking if you\u2019re TA for how you snapped at her on the phone. Yes, you are. \nYou were not TA for how you behaved on the date. \n\nSo based on what you are specifically asking to be judged, yes, YTA. \nYou could have handled it different despite being in the right.

Nobody likes being publicly called out and now she is doubling down. \n\nHow good a friend is she of yours? If this is a friendship you value and you want to give her the opportunity to make amends you could send her a text that doesn't condone the behaviour but gives her a way to move on. You did nothing wrong,  but sometimes people need a way out.\n\nIf not being friends with her is going to cause you issues you could write something like this;\n\nHi friend, \nI'm upset that we are at odds with each other. I would like to clear the air. It was not my intention to make you feel embarrassed or excluded and I understand your feelings were hurt. \nHowever, I think if you are really honest with yourself you will realise you would never have tried to insert yourself at the table if I was on a first date with a guy. That would have made you feel like you were imposing and it would have been weird. You didn't feel that way in this circumstance because you are straight, but to me and my date, it would have been weird and imposing to have you there. \n\nI am willing to move past this. I understand that what you did was unintentional and then you got defensive and felt embarrassed. Now that you understand my point of view I'm sure this situation wouldn't happen again. I also snapped at you a little on the phone and could have been calmer. We are all human, we all make mistakes. I think that this issue can be resolved with some understanding for each other. Let me know. \n\nHopefully that would be enough to get your friend to reflect and come back to you with an apology. If not,  then she isn't a friend you need.

Your \u201cfriend was extremely rude. She should have waited to be invited to join you, and if that invite did come, she should have left without being told to. It was a super AH move for her to discuss it with other members of the group and ever worse that someone else called you to express your friends displeasure. Who does that?

There is a difference between hanging out with a gay couple who are already in an established relationship and turning date nights into hang nights, *if* the couple are okay with it, and interrupting a first date because 'my other token gay friend lets me, so you should too'. One thing is not like the other. \n\nEven in straight relationships, an established couple are likely going to be more okay with a friend joining them for dinner (again, if they're both okay with it and like the friend) as opposed to a first date where you're testing the waters and you find the giant red flag of the friend who walks all over boundaries and doesn't understand social niceties. \n\nThis friend is not a friend.

Wtf? An established relationship is so different than the very very early \u201cgetting to know you\u201d dating stage. Yikes!", "NTA. Is your friend into you? It seems like she was hurt and jealous.", "NTA.  Even if you weren't on a date, what she did was rude.  Sometimes friends want one-on-one time and that's ok.  Even if she can't get her head around two women dating (which is stupid, btw, what's so hard about that, why does the gender of either person matter to anyone not on the date),she should be able to understand that.  You should never ask to join a group already seated (unless, maybe, there's no empty tables, or something) and it shouldn't matter why they are there.  Say hello and if they want you to join, they'll ask. Otherwise, walk away.  It's not a slight, they just have a reason to desire a one on one conversation.  The fact that she was told it was a date and she still pressed on being rude makes her ridiculous.  It sounds like jealousy, to me.  Not necessarily of a romantic nature, maybe just the \"you don't get to have other friends\" kind.", "I agree that OP is NTA.

Thank you for the response I appreciate it and everyone\u2019s comments are making me feel a bit more confident in my actions.", "Tbh you put into words what I was struggling to convey so thank you.

I was mostly concerned about the last comment and the general consensus is that it wasn\u2019t too out of bounds given the situation, so I\u2019m feeling a bit better about the situation now.", "How was it unnecessary when the friend kept grossly pushing the fact that she should have been allowed to stay because her other gay friends would have let her ? I would have freaking snapped too", "Why is she the asshole for that? The friend was rude to insist to join in the first place and then gets mad when she is asked politely to leave and THEN talks shit about OP behind her back.\n\nSo on the phone OP is 100% right that the friend would not try to join in on a straight couple - hence the reason she compared it her to other gay (male) friends instead of it just being a generally acceptable action to crash anyone's date. \n\nAfter ARGUING with OP on whether it's acceptable to crash a date, OP states the truth and tells her friend she's stereotyping then hangs up.\n\nWhy does OP need to coddle her through the phone conversation as the friend is clearly standing her ground by arguing? What would you expect her to do?", "I so deeply disagree with this comment. \n\nShe tried to handle it maturely and talk to her like an adult, and the friend kept pushing that she should have been allowed to stay because \"her other gay friends let her stay\" that's childish. OP is not the asshole and I'm gonna be honest, it's just wrong to say otherwise.", "Why is it always the accounts with that red headgear saying the worst takes lately", "She wasn't being friendly. She was being dismissive. She was treating her date as something that wasn't serious, and combined with an other irrelevant comparison to a gay couple, it's reasonable to conclude she's being homophobic and call her out on it.", "Nah, fuck this. Fuck all of this.

Incredibly weird reaction", "It\u2019s the fact you had to tell her twice: beat it, you\u2019re invading on a social-romantic situation. \n\nBut comparing it to hanging out with other gay friends who are partners is also rude and I can see why you didn\u2019t like the comparison because it\u2019s true.. she misses the point completely. That just because she\u2019s hung out with gay couples sometimes socially doesn\u2019t mean you were around for their first date or if they are casually dating others. On a hetero date I can\u2019t think of any guy who wouldn\u2019t be so weirded out for another female to not get a hint and keep crashing it, that he might not even want to continue with a second.", "No one is saying to coddle a person you disagree with, or even a person who is in the wrong. You can, however, be amicable. Snapping at someone, utilizing vulgarity, and hanging up on the person, seemed like an unneeded escalation.", "If you disagree you\u2019re entitled to your opinion on the matter, and may share your verdict in the thread as I have. No one has provided any reasoning to alter my assessment of the events.", "Not reasonable at all, especially that they've been friends for years. It's a triggered reaction, and her friend should not put up with that.\n\nIn any case, whether it's true or not, the friendship should be finished.", "Yes, but as I said, too friendly.", "Why should anyone be amicable to someone who is blatantly stereotyping and then continuing defend it? \n\nNot being friendly towards someone who is stereotyping her, was extremely rude and then talks shit about her behind her back does not make OP an asshole. Being an asshole would've been delving to her level, insulting her, whatever. \n\nBut she's allowed to be pissed. She doesn't have to say \"Well shucks okay agree to disagree, I'm hanging up now bye!\" or else she's an asshole. \n\nBut I doubt I'll convince you so, shucks, agree to disagree!", "If you can't see the logic of someone being pushed into snapping and saying aomething they might regret later then that's on your personality, not mine \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I don't know what mote I can say to put the logic of empathy into your brain or understanding the emotion of frustration and anger. That's not on me to try and change that, that's a deep personality thing", "If they've been friends for years, the friend should've been able to take no as an answer and left it at that. Not push the problem and basically tries invalidating OPs feelings by having another friend call and say her gay male friends would've allowed her to stay. Its common knowledge and common courtesy to let people be on a date alone, unless invited by said dates. I wouldn't want my best friend third wheeling a date with my partner and I. There are boundaries and the friend pushed them. OP is NTA as she tried setting up boundaries and they weren't not being respected. No, she shouldn't have yelled over the phone, but I understand where she's coming from. Her boundaries were being pushed and disrespected, and in turn, she became defensive.", "That's not friendly, that's lacking in self awareness, at best. It's rude to persist when the person explicitly says they're on a date and  beyond entitled to talk smack to mutual friends because someone sets a reasonable boundary that they don't want a third wheel on a date.", "You\u2019re correct, it isn\u2019t on you to do anything, so I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re trying to do so. \nI left a comment to render a verdict on the information presented, not to debate that assessment to someone not involved in it. You made the decision to comment to me, not the other way around. If you disagree, you\u2019re welcomed to. Render your verdict and share it to OP.", "That's not how reddit works. \nI truly don't care if you left a comment to debate or not. I saw something I disagreed with so i commented on it. Thanks so much for explaining to me how you think leaving comments works \ud83d\udc80\nEnjoy being wrong, and not understanding emotions."]}
