I have kind of integrated into her friend group(five other girls not including us) although I\u2019m not as close with them as they are with each other, which makes sense seeing as how they\u2019ve known each other a bit longer.\n\nI was recently on a first date with a woman that I\u2019ve liked for a bit (27f). We were having coffee at a cafe, and all of a sudden, my friend walks up to us and says hi. Not a big deal, I know she comes here a lot and I introduced them, my friend is super nice to my date. At this point, I hadn\u2019t told my friend this was a date. She knows I\u2019ve dated women in the past, but I wasn\u2019t expecting her to realize this was a date because it could very well have just been a friend. Then she asks if she can join us and starts to pull up a chair. \n\nMy date is visibly thrown off by this, as am I, and so I say \u201coh I\u2019m sorry but (date\u2019s name) and I are on a date right now. I\u2019ll see you later, though!\u201d\n\nMy friend says \u201coh, I don\u2019t mind!\u201d and sits. \n\nI reiterate, more clearly \u201cI\u2019d love to hang out another time but right now I\u2019d like for it to just be (date\u2019s name) and I\u201d\n\nShe says ok and leaves. I thought that was the end of it, not at all a big deal, I don\u2019t expect her to automatically know who I am or am not on a date with. \n\nI get a call from a different girl in the friend group that night, who tells me that my friend called her and was pissed off about earlier, so I immediately call my friend and ask if we can talk. She says it was rude of me to brush her off, it wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal to join us, and her other gay friend lets her hang out with him and his boyfriend all the time (this friend is not a part of the friend group, I have never met him). This gets to me a little because I feel like the two situations are only being compared because her friend and I are both not straight. I tell her that because it was a date, it\u2019s different and that she can\u2019t expect to join me on a first date. She keeps arguing, and finally I get fed up and snap at her \u201cbe fucking honest, if I was on a date with a guy you would have taken no for an answer and not had a problem\u201d and then hang up. \n\nShe has not talked to me since then, but she told the entire friend group and they are now split. I know this bc the friend who first told me that she was pissed off as well as one other girl messaged me individually to let me know what was going on and that they\u2019re sorry about what happened. \n\nThe messages from the people on my friend\u2019s (maybe former friend, idk) side are making me second guess myself, I do get that I snapped at her on the phone and was rude at the end of our conversation. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong for not wanting her to join us, but AITA for the way I behaved at the end of our convo?\n\nEdit/update:\n\nOk so the two girls who reached out and sided with me just let me know that I\u2019m the last few hours she\u2019s been saying stuff that pretty heavily implies that I\u2019m not actually bisexual and I\u2019m just straight. So I guess that explains a lot of it. They obviously were not ok with it, as one of the girls is bisexual and has a boyfriend. They both left the group chat and still want to be friends with me, the other people in our group chat have said nothing to me and honestly I don\u2019t need the drama.  It sucks to realize a friend of mine felt this way about me for years but I\u2019m glad I at least know what was up now.", "created_utc": 1687390584, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14fn5oc/aita_for_telling_a_friend_i_did_not_want_her_to/", "score": 3148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You handled it perfectly.", "NTA for your response on the phone. \n\nShe was being selfish and didn't seem open to your perspective. And to say her male gay friend is cool with it is ridiculous. So cause you're both on a same sex date the same rules apply to either of you? That's a dumb excuse.", "I'm sorry, no. NTA.\n\nYou handled it maturely, and instead of the situation being over and done with as it should have been, she kept it going by spreading it to other people. \n\nThat's massively immature. I'm bisexual and have dated men AND women, and I would have been very put off by someone thinking they could crash my date after I've made the situation clear that she's not welcome. \n\nNTA. And it's infuriating that your friends are split, she is very clearly in the wrong.", "NTA\n\nYou called your friend out on her bullshit and she couldn't take it like an adult.", "NTA. Even if you hadn't been on a date with the woman at your table, it is still rude to crash someone else's table without being invited to sit with them.  You were gentle but firm and she refused to take no for an answer.", "You were correct IMO in your assessment that the friend wouldn't have crashed your date if you'd been sitting with a man. It was disrespectful of her when you alerted her you were indeed on a date to not remove herself; dismissive and rude of her.\n\nI'm gonna say NTA cuz I get why you lost your temper with her, especially her having someone else play social secretary to complain to you rather than stepping up and speaking to you herself in the first place. \n\nYou've probably lost them as a friend, but that's not necessarily a negative if they're biphobic which it seems to me they are. They're certainly shit at communication.", "NTA. The last comment isn\u2019t what makes you an asshole, it\u2019s something she really needed to separate and clearly couldn\u2019t grasp it wasn\u2019t two girls who are friends catching up and hanging out even when you verbalized it was specifically a date. Because you\u2019re quite correct. You made it crystal clear she was invading on a dating situation and it was socially rude as fuck. The girl you were on a date with had a right to be taken aback because she at this point isn\u2019t sure and is asking herself this is someone you\u2019ve been involved with who\u2019s being messy, or just a friend acquaintance? Why aren\u2019t they getting the hint?\n\nHad you been sitting on a hetero date with a man, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d have even come up and done much besides quickly say hello and leave. And that had she stuck around it would have come off as some of the most literally insane pick-me girl shit to pull and would have definitely weirded out the guy so much it\u2019s not funny. She can\u2019t separate you having coffee with another female as anything besides meeting with a friend the way she would meet with you and the firmness you had to verbalize screams it because literally no one is that socially stupid or would be cool with you doing that to her on a first date.", "NTA - you're right ; and, why would anyone want to be a 3rd wheel??", "NTA. It was a first date. She should have excused herself without needing to be given a hint. You are right to be suspicious about the comparison with a gay couple because there's no other connection. Once people are actually boyfriends/girlfriends, it's normal for them to hang out with others, but even then they'd probably not want someone barging in on an official date.", "Corporate Life Lesson 101.

People get angry when you call them out on their crap and lack of manners and common sense. Regardless of who you were dating, asking someone to leave should have only needed to be done once.", "I don\u2019t think you were being homophobic. It sounds like your friend is actually biphobic if she would\u2019ve likely left you alone with a man but has a weird thing about thinking it\u2019s fine to tag along just because other gay friends let her. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly weird to invite yourself on someone else\u2019s date, and it is next level to not leave after being told once. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.  It sounds as if the friend doesn\u2019t understand the difference between hanging out with an established couple vs. hanging out with two people who are on a first date.  Maybe \u201cfirst date\u201d didn\u2019t penetrate her brain when she heard it.  But I also think that what you said on the phone may have some truth to it.  Had you need out with a guy, I think she would have heard and understood the word \u201cdate\u201d more clearly.  She saw two women sitting together and decided it would be fine have a coffee klatch.", "NTA. You handled this well!", "NTA That was so blatantly rude.", "NTA.

I would like to clear the air. It was not my intention to make you feel embarrassed or excluded and I understand your feelings were hurt. \nHowever, I think if you are really honest with yourself you will realise you would never have tried to insert yourself at the table if I was on a first date with a guy.

I understand that what you did was unintentional and then you got defensive and felt embarrassed. Now that you understand my point of view I'm sure this situation wouldn't happen again. I also snapped at you a little on the phone and could have been calmer. We are all human, we all make mistakes. I think that this issue can be resolved with some understanding for each other.

Even if she can't get her head around two women dating (which is stupid, btw, what's so hard about that, why does the gender of either person matter to anyone not on the date),she should be able to understand that.  You should never ask to join a group already seated (unless, maybe, there's no empty tables, or something) and it shouldn't matter why they are there.  Say hello and if they want you to join, they'll ask. Otherwise, walk away.  It's not a slight, they just have a reason to desire a one on one conversation.
