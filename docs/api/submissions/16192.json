Really shouldn't have communicated per text for this, though.

It does not matter what your sister thinks or how she means it, no means no.", "I would say N T A, you're absolutely right for defending your husband from these attacks, as it undoubtedly feels to him.\n\nBut.\nThe problem here is not malice. Each of you has the best intentions. The problem here is a lack of knowledge.\n\nFrom what you say, your husband has an aversion to touch. Like, not just pain, or touch that others would find annoying, but he experiences _all_ touch except yours as overwhelming.\n\nTo people who have never experienced this or heard about this, this is unthinkable. Your sister's assumption that your husband is \"shy\", and that your mind must be jumping to sexualisation, is a big indicator of this. She cannot fathom that something as innocent as a hug between family members can be overwhelming and suffocating to some people.\n\nSo, educate her.\nExplain that a lot of people have nervous systems that are prone to overwhelm. For some, the trigger is sound (like me: I can't be around running motorcycles, it makes me want to scream, clutch my ears and kick someone). For others, it's light (they can't bear glaring phone screens) or smell (put on too much perfume and they'll have a migraine for the rest of the day).\n\nFor your husband, it is touch. It took you months to get him used to your touch. He doesn't spend enough time with your sister to get used to hers, nor should he have to.\n\nNAH but if they still want to touch him after you explain about this, then they're the A.", "ESH. Bottom line: Your sister needs to learn that other people's social boundaries are different from hers. \nHowever, I think you could have handled this better OP.\n\nI appreciate you standing up for your husband, given he seems to be suffering silently, but you should have discussed a course of action beforehand; now he feels terrible and there is a strong chance your family think he wanted this. \n\nChanging the dynamic to enforce the boundaries but without jumping straight to an \"extreme\" would have been better. Saying \"... or you can't come to the house anymore\" is obviously going to cause arguments; reiterating the boundaries to your sister and suggesting you go out to eat at a restaurant instead to help your sister remember them would have been a more amenable step (there would be a table between you at all times, less likely to be touchy in public etc). \n\nIt may also have been worth having this conversation in person rather than via text so that you can be clear yet manage the tone. Yes, this is more effort than you should need to put in when your sister is the one at fault, but if you want to maintain the close relationship then it is effort you may need to make.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you tell her that, she\u2019ll be, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be friendly!\u201d Friends do not force their friends Into unwanted, physical touch.

Normal kind, loving people would immediately try to stop doing this around him, not force him to just accept their behavior.  **Her attitude is entitled, not kind or loving.**  There's nothing in her attitude that says she's thinking of him.  It's all thinking of herself.\n\n*Its reached the point where he just sits in our bedroom through the evenings my family are here.* \n\n**One solution to this is to stop inviting them to your house.  Guests should be a Two Yesses, One No Rule.**  Whatever is in your husband's history, he's not telling you with words how devastating this is to him, but **he's protecting himself with his actions, and that is a healthy move for him.**  If he's getting therapy, good.  If he's not, maybe look into making it a goal that you just listen and he talks about what bothers him, so that things don't go this far in the future before you find solutions so he's not feeling so uncomfortable in his own home.  **Home should be a safe place for him,** not a place he can't be part of the group, and not a place he feels disrespected and attacked by the guests.\n\n*Yesterday I sent my sister a text that said she had to realize how uncomfortable she makes my husband every time she visits, and if she couldn't keep her hands to herself, I didn't want her over anymore.* \n\n**She's had four years to learn.

She was trying to make him conform to her expectations for family.  **Helping someone feel like family means listening to them, and respecting their needs and wants, not pushing your own on them** and forcing them to comply.  Forcing someone to comply has another description:  abuse. \n\n*She got upset and hung up on me, and then my mom rings me about how immature we're both being and how we're making a big deal over basic social friendliness.* \n\n**Basic social friendliness is based on respect** for the other person.  What they believe isn't basic.  It's their wants.  I wonder how many other people they know are avoiding them now, because of their lack of respect and insistence on forcing compliance from everyone else.  \n\n**This is typical of manipulators, to blame you, to dismiss the real problem,** and to push aside all responsibility and accountability for the person who has been doing the behavior being objected to.  You are not being immature at all.  **You are insisting that your spouse be respected in your own home.  That's mature and healthy behavior.  You are doing the right thing here, and being belittled for it.**  That's emotionally abusive behavior, when it's a pattern.  THEY are wrong.  \n\n*She even called me dirty minded for saying she was too much. They're so put out about it that I've just stopped responding to them.*\n\n**Good for you, to stop responding to them.  They are attacking now, which is typical of manipulative and abusive people to do** when someone calls them out for their disrespect. \n\nLet them sulk.  **Don't chase them.

They don't care about his needs or his views.  **They tried to force his compliance** to how they want to act, and he's decided to protect himself now, and avoid them.  That's healthy.  You are standing with him in this, and that's how it should be, and also healthy.  They are going to try to convince you to join them, and force his compliance, if they follow typical patterns for people like this.  They are going to try to make you feel guilty for objecting to their behaviors.  Don't apologize.  \n\n**They owe the apologies.**  If they demand apologies from you, and you want to respond, say something like \"When you are ready to apologize for the disrespect and mistreatment of my husband, we will read it.\"  Write out your own statement, and, if you want to respond, send the same thing every time they bring this up.  \n\n *My husband feels terrible and thinks this stupid argument is all his fault, and everyone feels like shit.* \n\n**This is not his fault.**  You two are protecting him from people who knew his needs and ignored and dismissed his feelings, disrespected him repeatedly, and tried to force his compliance with their wants.  **That's emotional abuse.  It's gone on for years.**  It's abusive treatment, from entitled people, when they refuse to accept that not everyone likes their way of doing things, and their way of doing things make others uncomfortable enough to leave the room and need to protect themselves. \n\n**This is their fault.  Husband ought to have been respected from the beginning.**  It's not hard.\n\n*Should I have just left it alone?* \n\n**You did the right thing.  Their treatment of him was wrong.**\n\n*I still think I should have said something, but it feels like I just made everything worse.*\n\n**You didn't make everything worse.** They are making things worse, on purpose, to force you to comply and stop objecting to their wrong behaviors.  They could have reacted differently.  **They are reacting this way, to try to force you two to feel like you are in the wrong, and to turn themselves into victims.  This is a manipulation tactic called DARVO.**  They are manipulating hard, to make you two feel bad about the conflict, and stop objecting.  They expect this to end with your compliance.  Not healthy. \n\n Normal people, kind and loving people, would have said \"Oh, right, I'm sorry I forgot.  I need to work on this and change my behavior around him.  I wonder how many other people don't like this behavior?  Wow.\"  Your relatives are doubling down, trying to make this into a big fuss **so that** you two give in and are overwhelmed in guilt.  If you do give in, they will only get worse and the next time you need to object to them overstepping lines, they will attack in the same ways to force your compliance again.  **This is about them getting their wants, and ignoring your needs and your objections.  This is about their control in your lives.** \n\nWhat you can do, is take this situation and find the good things in it. Instead of doing the next family event at your house,  make plans and put them on your calendars, for you and husband to choose something else that's fun for both of you to do.  And when someone asks, just say \"We have plans\" and do not explain or tell what those plans are. People who cannot respect your spouse do not deserve to know details about your lives.  \"We have plans\" is enough information.  **Invite over friends that actually show respect to your husband**.

Person A *might* choose !Ask - Hug - which she obviously, which is the problem identified in the post. If we assume that saying \"No hug\" is too awkward, as you're arguing here, then we're really down to two possible scenarios from which we can choose: !Ask - !Hug and Ask - Hug.\n\nOP has basically already tried asking sister to !Ask - !Hug. She's not listening to that, maybe because her urge to hug is too strong. Ask - Hug is far, far better than !Ask - Hug for people who don't automatically like hugs.\n\nHubby might still dislike the hugs, but I would bet 9 out of ten people would greatly appreciate the ask and it would mitigate much of the stress involved in the situation.

Saying \"i appreciate you wanting to make me feel like family but im uncomfortable with the physical affection\" is being nice. Whats not nice is actively avoiding setting your boundries for literal years until it becomes an untenable problem and he ends up hiding in his room like a child instead. Refusing to actually set your own boundaries and then getting mad that they get crossed is ridiculous. Yes, sis should have just accepted what op had to say, but also people who are affectionate with family are doing so subconsciously and the only real way to enforce that boundry appropriate is to point it out and address it politely in the moment. Being honest is being nice.", "Unwanted physical contact is not just harassment; it's also assault and battery.", "In the US harassment is typically more general and refers to behavior, where assault requires physical touch which is the case here. Just pointing it out because assault is arguably more severe. \n\nPoint still being, and I think we all agree, if the genders were reversed that\u2019s what this would be called. The OP and her husband are NTA. The sister is crossing a serious line whether she wants to admit it or not. \n\nGiving someone a hug as a greeting when it\u2019s a habit and a familial/cultural norm and you don\u2019t know they are made uncomfortable by physical touch is one thing, and excusable, but repeatedly being told and shown it makes them uncomfortable and still refusing to stop doing it is flat out assault (regardless of the intent is sexual).", "I have to let my fianc\u00e9 handle his family. I would rip them to shreds verbally if I got the chance. Except my sisters-in-law. They\u2019re wonderful. But his parents and brother? I\u2019d rip them to shreds and leave them for the vultures.", ">They always assume you either dislike the person or you are insinuating that there is a sexual motive behind the touching.  \n\n\nYES and that drives me bonkers. The number of times I've had people arguing, \"but I didn't mean anything by it!\" Yes, I understand that, now please stop *doing* it.", "You claimed I was shaming him for staying in his room. I explained my issue is largely with him not communicating the obvious discomfort (that lead him to hide out in his room )with his wife and that having implications for the marriage. You keep putting intention behind my words that isn\u2019t there. Then in a display of great maturity refuse to read my comments.  I\u2019m trying to have an adult conversation with you, but you\u2019re not being reasonable. You\u2019ve also disregarded all of the things I\u2019ve said that explain this would be my reaction if the genders were reversed. \n\nYou were not completely clear about that - your first comment to me was focused ENTIRELY on me \u201cshaming him\u201d for hiding out in his room which isn\u2019t what I was doing. When I explain myself you ignore it and keep going back to \u201cif this was a woman you wouldn\u2019t say that\u201d schtick. You keep adding different intention to my words and insulting me, I explain myself calmly, and then you have the audacity to state you won\u2019t read what I wrote. This is bonkers.", "As a guy, if I say I'm fine, it's because I don't want to cause a problem. It's pretty clear that he's now having to deal with exactly what he didn't want to happen precisely because his wife defended him without his buy-in.\n\nI as an outside observer consider the wife's attitude about the situation the most healthy, but I think she should have had a much better conversation with him before doing this. I also place the years of him having to deal with his sil's touching on him because he insisted he was fine. If you're going to fight someone else's battles, you need their permission.", "Just stop. I\u2019m not wasting any more time with this. You protest too much, and it makes it very obvious that you know my simple point was correct. You said something shitty. Learn from it. We all do it.", "NTA, she needs to respect his autonomy and stop making him uncomfortable", "Oh man. So not the AH in this situation. I'm the same way; hate being touched, hate being hugged, just hate it. It makes me so uncomfortable and I come from a very physically affectionate family as well. I am so happy that your husband has you to advocate for him and make sure his boundaries aren't being crossed.", "You're NTA for standing up for your husband. \n\nMaybe intead of hosting these times with your mom and sister, you could leave husband at home and you go over to visit at their houses?", "NTA. You are sticking up for your husband in a fair and understandable way. You are anything but an asshole", "She set boundaries. Over and over. And sister disregarded them. Over and over.\n  OP is NTA.", "NTA. Everyone has personal boundaries and your husband is not in the wrong for having them. It\u2019s weird your sister can\u2019t respect that and continues to touch someone who visibly jumps out of his skin when she does. If someone did that once after me touching them, I would be considerate and not do it again.", "NTA, outside of a handshake or a MUTUAL hug I absolutely hate being touched by people that aren't my wife or kid. \n\nGood on you, hold your ground. Your family is being inconsiderate and immature.", "NTA. She was banking on it just going away, it didn't, and she didn't like that. That's all, no fault of yours. This sucks terribly for you and your husband, I'm sorry.", "You are so so very much NTA! Your sister is torturing your husband in a display of dominance. He is having trauma responses to her presence. She's not just being friendly, this is the mean girl version of its just a joke bro.\n\nYou  on the other hand are being a good caring loving partner to your good caring loving partner. Woah look at the diamond spine on you!", "Nta. Touch for some is very intimate and some people just dont like to be touched. Its a hard lesson your family needs to learn about boundaries and keeping their fucking hands to themselves.", "NTA - as someone who dislikes sudden physical contact by someone I don't really know, I can understand where your husband is coming from. Your sister is being T A for not listening to the multiple times you have tried to tell her that kind of contact makes him uncomfortable. Not everyone is super touchy feely and respect people's boundaries. If she had done that crap to me she probably would of caught a few elbows to the ribs after the first few times.", "I know how he feels. I hate being touch (except kids/babies) it drive me crazy.  Yet my parents and aunt still touches me even tho they know I don't like it.my siblings basicly same way unless it there terms. I say NTA..but I don't think she will stop tho", "NTA, I\u2019m very much the same as your husband and if someone was constantly touching me I would either cry or scream\u2026it\u2019s his house, he should be able to be comfortable in his house, and your sister not being down with basic consent is gross.", "NTA.   Your sister is not incapable of understanding this.  She is choosing to do it anyway.  She is choosing to deliberately make your husband uncomfortable.   She likes it.  It's fun.", "> Your husband gets so uncomfortable when she comes over he just sits in his room.\n\nHe should also work in thins IMO. If general affection from family members makes you uncomfortable, that's a you issue. Social interactions involve a give and take. It shouldn't be up to you to always accommodate my issue. \n\nIts one thing if she was singling him out, and being flirty or inappropriate, but from what OP described, that wasnt the case.", "No, he just doesn\u2019t like being touched. Sometimes people are just themselves.", "Something like if someone can or cannot touch my body shouldn\u2019t be something someone compromises on for many reasons.", "Thats incredibly short sighted and self-centered. What if a child need to be comforted? *Fuck off! Don't Touch me!!*?\n\nI don't agree with the attitude of, \"I don't need to ever work on my issues\". That's kind of thinking is in line with personality disorders.\n\nNo, he shouldn't be expected to do a complete 180. But he entered the family by choice. He needs to do some work, too. ITs not normal to not want to be touched, ever. Or to not want to give an ounce of affection to family members. He has to hide in his room. Thats not healthy, no matter how you spin it.", "It's a fair point. There's clearly a lot of communication deficits to go around, here.\n\nCounterpoint is that in many relationships it's the \"responsibility\" of each partner to deal with any sticky issues with their own family, so maybe that dynamic is at play? I mean, I would totally be fine having a conversation with either of my husband's two sisters, and he is fine talking to both my sister and brother.", "Also this is referring to a grown woman, who should be able to \u201cgive and take\u201d, but it sounds like you\u2019re just focused on him giving up his autonomy.", "Lol I completely understand where you\u2019re coming from - I\u2019m really not much of a hugger AT ALL and feel suffocated in those situations. Fine when my husband does it but he\u2019s the exception for sure. But I\u2019m also lucky that my family respected that when I said something.", "> but it sounds like you\u2019re just focused on him giving up his autonomy.\n\nIt sounds like your focused on insisting what my point is. \n\n>No, he shouldn't be expected to do a complete 180\n\n>He needs to do *some* work,\n\nthis is what I said. Where in there did I say he just needs to give up his autonomy?\n\nI mentioned in another reply that they need to meet each other halfway. But rather than actually having a conversation with questions, it sounds like you\u2019re just focused on talking at me. \n\nCool.", "Right.  One requires no contact and the other one requires charges pressed.", "I must have forgot to ask questions because of all the ones you were asking instead of talking at me.", "My second sentence to you was a question. I also never insisted you made a point that you didn't. If you don't want to discuss this in good faith, and you just need me to be the bag guy, then I'm done with this conversation."]}
