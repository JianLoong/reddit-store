Really shouldn't have communicated per text for this, though. Talk to your sister in person and explain that you weren't accusing her of anything sexual, but that she needs to respect your husband's boundaries. She probably just doesn't get it, but is still the AH for not taking his feelings seriously.

I'm trying to understand why she would continuously do something that upsets him so much, then get butt hurt when you added a simple boundary?", "YTA. You should have put a stop to this years ago. It does not matter what your sister thinks or how she means it, no means no.", "I would say N T A, you're absolutely right for defending your husband from these attacks, as it undoubtedly feels to him.\n\nBut.\nThe problem here is not malice. Each of you has the best intentions. The problem here is a lack of knowledge.\n\nFrom what you say, your husband has an aversion to touch. Like, not just pain, or touch that others would find annoying, but he experiences _all_ touch except yours as overwhelming.\n\nTo people who have never experienced this or heard about this, this is unthinkable. Your sister's assumption that your husband is \"shy\", and that your mind must be jumping to sexualisation, is a big indicator of this. She cannot fathom that something as innocent as a hug between family members can be overwhelming and suffocating to some people.\n\nSo, educate her.\nExplain that a lot of people have nervous systems that are prone to overwhelm. For some, the trigger is sound (like me: I can't be around running motorcycles, it makes me want to scream, clutch my ears and kick someone). For others, it's light (they can't bear glaring phone screens) or smell (put on too much perfume and they'll have a migraine for the rest of the day).\n\nFor your husband, it is touch. It took you months to get him used to your touch. He doesn't spend enough time with your sister to get used to hers, nor should he have to.\n\nNAH but if they still want to touch him after you explain about this, then they're the A.", "ESH. Bottom line: Your sister needs to learn that other people's social boundaries are different from hers. \nHowever, I think you could have handled this better OP.\n\nI appreciate you standing up for your husband, given he seems to be suffering silently, but you should have discussed a course of action beforehand; now he feels terrible and there is a strong chance your family think he wanted this. \n\nChanging the dynamic to enforce the boundaries but without jumping straight to an \"extreme\" would have been better. Saying \"... or you can't come to the house anymore\" is obviously going to cause arguments; reiterating the boundaries to your sister and suggesting you go out to eat at a restaurant instead to help your sister remember them would have been a more amenable step (there would be a table between you at all times, less likely to be touchy in public etc). \n\nIt may also have been worth having this conversation in person rather than via text so that you can be clear yet manage the tone. Yes, this is more effort than you should need to put in when your sister is the one at fault, but if you want to maintain the close relationship then it is effort you may need to make.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I quickly learned to respect those boundaries and she appreciates it.  But I also grieve the fact that I can\u2019t wrap her up in a big hug, especially if I see her struggling with some feelings.  I also love her for tolerating quick goodbye hugs from my elderly mother when my daughter comes along on a visit a couple times per year.  OP, NTA for trying to help your husband set boundaries.  Your sister and mom are TA for refusing to understand that some people are wired differently and thinking their way is the only natural, normal way and they can convert him if they just keep making him uncomfortable.", "Intent isn\u2019t what matters.

From someone who absolutely loathes being touched by anyone or everyone, I can vouch for it. It's a personal choice just like being touchy is. What's the big deal about it? You and your husband have nothing to feel guilty about.

I used to get berated in friend groups (still do while going out occasionally) all because they would be like your sister, all handsy and touchy feely, and I would politely ask them to stop. A small handful of people were nice about it, the rest not so much.

This is also very closely related to the concept of \"love languages.\" \"Huggy\" people often rank physical touch as a very important love language. OP's husband clearly does not. That's the issue. \n\nIt's not an accusation of inappropriate flirtation or thinking of infidelity, it's literally a question of physical boundaries, and while some people have a \"personal bubble,\" others seem to just have magnets that make them want to hug and touch others all the time. Bubble-people *hate* casual touching with social groups, and that needs to be understood and respected.\n\nIt seems hubby is pretty resilient to all of this and doesn't resent anyone, he is just super uncomfortable being touched so much. OP should sit down with her sister and really hash out this discussion. Usually, unless the person has extremely thin skin or other confidence problems, you can begin to help them understand the issue. It's important not to frame this as how sister is doing things wrong, like she's a bad person. Touching and hugging is fine - when it is wanted or has been consented to - it's just that most of their family has standing, open consent for hugs etc while hubby does not.\n\nI would bet that if sister simply practiced directly asking OP's hubby if she can give him a hug when they greet, and resisted some of the casual arm touches during conversations (again, asking from time to time if the touch is appropriate when sister wants to make a deliberate motion) this problem would dramatically improve. People who don't like physical touch can often tolerate it better when they expect it and it is asked for, as this demonstrates some respect for consent and autonomy.", "I am neurotypical, with no serious mental health issues (afaik!) but I also can't be doing with people touching me, other than my wife. \n\nAnd cats.

My aversion to handshakes is because I'm autistic", "Are you German?", "THIS. Everyone has different comfort levels when it comes to personal space. For me, with the exception of my furchild and a few close friends, I don't want to be touched. Neither does her husband and that's okay. \n\nHer sister feels entitled to other peoples bodies and believes her needs trump other peoples discomfort and they absolutely do not. This was not about him feeling the type of touch was inappropriate, it's that all touch is inappropriate and I could not agree more that she's exaggerating what was said so she can avoid being accountable. If your an adult, someone should have to tell you they don't want to be touched exactly 1 time. It's not a negotiation.", "I was thinking exactly this. If the role reveres and so the genders, how uncomfortable this sounds. As of because he is a guy he should not have any problem being touched unnecessarily.

People should understand this", "Idk sometimes writing stuff like that down so that you can plan & check your wording is the right way to go.

She laughs about how \"shy\" he is, says he'll get over it.\"\n\nOP has tried talking to her sister, several times, nothing was getting through; in fact the sister literally laughed at the boundaries and basically refused to even consider backing off.
