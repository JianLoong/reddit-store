You knew the lease was coming up and just didn't mention at all to your roommate that you were going to not remain there? If you gave no indication that you wanted to move or that you didn't want her around the reasonable thing for her to do when she gets the renewal is to sign so you all aren't held up waiting for her to get back. Imagine if she did that, and you guys became homeless because of it.\n\nDon't worry though,  she won't have to imagine what it would be like if you guys made her homeless!\n\nIt would be a really crummy thing to do tbh. She's away, and she gets back and.. what? Can't get into her home? Has no idea where her things are? Unless you CAN contact her like the adults you are and talk about all of this instead of surprising her when she lands back home. \n\nBetter hope your other roommate doesn't pull this on you a year into your next lease. Oof.", "Wow, that's a toughie alright, shame that for the past month or so you three just never had the opportunity to talk with each other.  If only there was some means of communication where one person could talk to another over long distances via small devices easily carried on one's person, or maybe electronic correspondence between devices or a service that transports physical items like letters from one point to another, you'd have been able to communicate with \"Kim\" and let her know about your intent to move.  \n\n\nYTA, in case the sarcasm didn't make the point plain.", "INFO: Is your current apartment in 1923, where no one has phones?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you really not have a single friend in common, an emergency contact, or even her email?\n\nWhere did you plan on leaving the storage room key?", "So... you have been talking about not renewing your lease for months, but couldn't be arsed to tell Kim because she's \"never around\".  You don't have her PHONE NUMBER??\n\nYTA.  She signed the lease.  You never told her you didn't plan to sign the lease.  I presume you actually do have her phone number and just were too head up your butt to text her and say, \"yeah we're finding some where else to live\". \n\nHOW HAVE YOU NOT TEXTED HER YET??! WHY ARE YOU ON REDDIT TELLING US YOU'RE MOVING AND NOT HER?\n\nWhat's WRONG with you?\n\nYTA", "INFO: you had absolutely no way of communicating with Kim before the end of the lease? This is a conversation that should have definitely already happened.", "YTA because you're communicating this to strangers on the internet and not her.", "Did you text her? Did you call her? Did you phone her? I get she\u2019s not \u201caround\u201d much but given most modern communication technologies being \u2018around\u201d is not the primary source of communication. You \u201ctalked\u201dto your other housemate and apparently failed on all other communication pathways with Kim. YTA", "YTA. You say you and Cath have been talking about it for months. Well, you could have written Kim a quick email in a few minutes during any of those months preceding the end of your lease.", "YTA. You never once, in all the time that she was your flatmate, put up a sticky note saying \"we need to talk about the lease\" or sent her a text saying \"we might move, talk to me asap\" or anything like that? Nothing? You let her leave thinking all was hunky-dory and the lease was going to be renewed and then she comes back and SURPRISE! No home! YTA so very very much. You should have found thirty seconds at some point in the last few MONTHS to text her that you were thinking of moving and not to sign the lease w/out talking to you.", "YTA, normally a lease is assumed to be signed continuing unless otherwise stated, that's the way landlords work, you need to provide 60 days notice if you're not staying to a landlord, so logically you should provide the same notice to a housemate.\n\nKim signing the lease without speaking to you is completely normal, and in fact, responsible, she saw the lease was up, and did her side of the paperwork without you needing to chase her up.\n\nTerminating a lease without apropriate notice to your landlord is illegal, and will cost you money, and it's a dick move to your housemate since you're making her homeless, she may have to move in with her parents, or crash on a friends' couch, or she might not have those options available to her.\n\nDo not cancel your lease, sign on for another year, and then talk to your housemates and plan how you're going to move out since you now know you don't intend to renew. That way everyone has plenty of time to find new accommodation. \n\n\nAs someone who ended up homeless because my housemate decided to break our lease without warning, do not leave your housemate out to dry, don't be an arsehole.", "You have the social skills of a home bound 11 year old. You should have had the decency to text her two months ago and give her a heads up that you wouldn't be renewing. Sure it would have been wise of her to check in with you before re-signing but yours is the bigger conflict avoidance asshole move. YTA", "YTA for not telling her, ending the lease is fine but she deserves to know before hand and not be blind sided when she gets back. Its really not weird to sign the lease without talking to you guys because its just maintaining the status quo, it doesn't change anything for her to sign it especially since you need to sign it as well to have an effect. Not signing it on the other hand very much does have an effect on everyone involved.", "YTA, it's just common freakin' courtesy to tell someone that you're moving out. I mean, jeez.", "YTA it's called email.  Don't tell me you have absolutely no way of contacting her.", "YTA. You literally know where she lives, it wasn't that hard to get her a message.", "Yta and awful people, what is wrong with you?", "YTA.", "Okay so YTA for still not telling her. You can move and live wherever you want, but this is the time you say \u201chey! I know you haven\u2019t been around but X and I will be moving to another city and living together and ending this lease. We are happy to organise your belongings, did you have anywhere to store them or shall I rent you a storage locker? Let me know! I need to know by X date.", "Yeah, that is a total asshole move.", "It sounds like you haven't done anything yet and you're asking if your would be the asshole if you just packed up her stuff.\n\nIf that's the case, **you should contact her and discuss this before you do anything.**\n\nI'd lean towards ESH if you did actually did already pack her stuff up. While she shouldn't have just signed the year extension without talking to you two (I'm noticing a lack of communication), just moving her stuff into storage isn't a particularly great thing to do either. Who will be paying for it? What happens if things get broken/get misplaced? Speaking from experience, having someone pack up my stuff when I wasn't there was an absolute disaster, and royally pissed me off even before I saw how badly they packed valuable items.\n\nAs of right now, I'd say a verdict could go any way if nothing has been done yet.\n\nBut again, **reach out and talk to her!**", "Correct process:\n*3 months ago*: hey Kim, this is op, just to let you know we are planning to move out after our lease. Please make alternative arrangements for after then, either find some new people to move in or find a new place, thanks.\n\nReally couldn't send a text? Also if she's paying rent she can't just be evicted cos the fixed term ends", "YTA \u2018I\u2019ve tried nothing and I\u2019m all out of ideas\u2019 - that\u2019s how dumb you sound", "ESH.  Yes, it is weird that she would try and commit you for another 12 months without a conversation.  It is equally (more?) weird that you would move out, move her stuff into storage, and leave her without housing \u2014 all without a conversation.", "YTA", "NTA maybe.  When the lease renewal was sent to you, this is the time to make a decision on what to do.  Kim didn't discuss with anyone else whether or not they were planning on staying and assumed that they would so just signed the lease.  She's not completely in the right here\n\nTechnically she can stay there.. and find some new housemates to share the rent with.\n\nDo you have a way to communicate with her?  You need to let her know that you aren't going to sign another lease and ask her what she wants to do.\n\nAlso how long is it going to take to find another place to live?  It may take longer than you think and by then Kim might be back and have some new housemates organised.", "NTA - Because you're being considerate enough to deal with Kim's stuff while she's away.  \nYou could have been a d\\*\\*\\* about it and simply walked away leaving the Land Lord to deal with.", "NTA in my mind. You aren\u2019t obligated to stay, that\u2019s the point of a lease and y\u2019all decided not to renew which is well within your rights. \n\nYou\u2019re also doing the decent thing in the circumstances by boxing her stuff and putting it in storage rather than letting the landlord go through it and dump it on the sidewalk then keep the security deposit as a \u2018cleaning fee\u2019.\n\nIs it shitty she\u2019s going to come back and be homeless, yes.
