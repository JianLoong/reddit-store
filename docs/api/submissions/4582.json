You don't have enough room for everyone to actually function in the house for six weeks. I swear people these days just don't know what \"asking\" means.", "NTA. You're not obligated to house them. Tell your aunt to either house them or shut her hole.", "Nta you are keeping both your dog and the kids safe.", "NTA\n\nYou're not making them \"homeless\" at all. If your mum is so worried about it then she can take them in.\n\nThere'll be even more yelling and screaming if your dog bites one of the kids because they ran up to him and tried to pet him", "NTA\n\nI have a 3 year old, and I wouldn't allow him near a dog who's owner said they wouldn't tolerate him. Not for a visit, much less for 6 weeks. That's just stupid and dangerous and asking for an incident. \n\nYou know your dog. If you think it won't work, then it won't work. If your aunt is so worried, then she can pay for them to go to her.", "ESH. You for calling a dog your baby, your cousin for wanting to move in and your aunt for screaming.", "Why isn't his Mom/Auntie or any of the other family pitching in for some short term housing\n\nAdding FIVE people into your house/work space is just impractical.  Unless you have a HUGE house.\n\nAnd their decision that your dog should be temporarily rehomed or simply imprisoned because of their presence is offensive.  Dog's home--not theirs. Dog takes priority.\n\nAuntie can help them rent a house for two months.  That will give them time to ease into new place.\n\nETA OP=NTA", "NTA. I'll be straight up. I am not a pet owner and I never got this, my dog is my fur baby thing that people talk about.  But this is your home, this is the pet that you love, you both work at home and it would be impossible with 3 active kids to get your work done.  It wouldn't be fair to the kids, they are in a strange place, in flux, with a pet that would be scared and upset and you aren't even close with these people.  Six weeks is a looooong time for a hot mess like this.  They should be responsible for finding proper temporary housing, not you. And they shouldn't try and make you feel bad about it.  They asked, and you explained why it probably wouldn't be a good idea and they were jerks in return.  This isn't on you.", "Also, the cousin didn\u2019t even attempt to offer compromises or solutions for keeping his kids away from OP\u2019s dog. He wants free housing and put the onus on OP to keep his kids safe from her dog. If you want free housing, you gotta bring something to the table, offer to curtail your kids\u2019 behaviors. Even if it\u2019s as little as \u201cput the kids in daycare until the parents finish work to make sure the kids are supervised at all times\u201d and \u201ckeeping the kids in their room.\u201d \n\nWhy should the dog be locked up while the kids run wild? Why not keep the kids in their room(s) while the dog continues to enjoy his home?!", "Right?! Like oh yeah now that you've yelled at me over a single no I'm totally convinced this will be great!", "I can't even imagine being as entitled as these people.\n\nInsulting you and telling you what to do, **while asking you for a massive favour?!?!?**\n\nWho are these people?", "Why do they have to stay close by? Or at least all of them? Go stay with Grandma! NTA", "NTA\n\nOh the entitlement.  Don't feel guilty.  You have valid points.  Even if you didn't, no means no.", "NTA. Realistically, most people don't have the space and capacity to host five people for six weeks.", "I totally get it.  I also peed in terror once when a kid ran up to me.\n\nN T A", "NTA - these people have 3 children and housing them is their responsibly\n\nWhen you say they are losing their housing 'through no fault of their own' , I suspect you have not been told the truth and I bet they had involvement in how they ended up in this situation.", "NTA", "YTA, I understand the dog is your baby but people realize human babies are involved. It\u2019s cruel to have your niece/nephews become homeless. And I don\u2019t blame him for calling you an AH cause it\u2019s true.", "NTA.", "The TA is your cousin for dictating to you and your household with regards to her dog. You have outlined good reasons as to why you can not provide temporary accommodation. It is difficult enough to have active children in your personal space, but if they are badly behaved  and have no boundaries it will have an impact on your work, money from which keeps a roof over your head, pays the bills etc. If they cause any damages, will they pay for it? If the children affect your working life negatively, will the compensate you for any potential loss of earnings?  The onus should not be put on you.", "NTA. A simple NO would be fine. You don\u2019t even have to provide any explanation as to why you don\u2019t want to house them. It\u2019s your house and yours and your husband\u2019s decision about who can stay and who can\u2019t. Cousins can stay at a hotel.", "Better yet-how about they just don\u2019t move in. Problems avoided.", "My response to that would have been to tell him to keep his kids penned up in a room for safety.\n\nThe biggest magnet on my refrigerator says: ***\"The cat lives here.  You're just visiting.\"***", "Oh, definitely. I meant that the usually people in the cousin\u2019s position would try to demonstrate some good faith. But when someone doesn\u2019t even try to show good faith, you know that you absolutely do not let that person in.", "NTA.\n\nWhy isn't the mother taking them in? Since she's so upset about them being homeless.", "And his mother can't house them during that time because...don't worry, I'll wait. \nAnd yet they think you're the asshole?  I call BS.  NTA.", "Also you didn't make anyone homeless ' at all. You are at YOUR HOME  WITH YOUR DOG.  NTA in the least and while  I have empathy for them not having  an apartment/house you shouldn't  house them if you work from home. It's  hard if people (adults)are mindful  and they still make noise and interrupt  you  ,the children  won't  be  able to behave  as you need for wfh", "Haha Sorry I probably should have added this now but she lives 6 hours away so my cousin wouldn't be able to get to work.", "Why does close matter? Kids that young aren\u2019t (likely) in school.\n\nIf cousin\u2019s family wants to stay with your aunt \ud83d\udc4d if cousin needs to be close for work - that sounds manageable but a family of 5 with little kids WOW \u2026 and is anyone SURE it will only be 6 weeks?\n\nEdit NTA", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA. They won't be paying rent or utilities during that time so they can stay at an airbnb or extended stay motel. Your dog is family, not a toy.", "NTA it\u2019s the dogs home. Why is your aunt screaming at you instead of getting of her ass and offering her babies a place to stay? Oh could it be she doesn\u2019t want to live with them for six weeks either? Nooooo surely not.", "NTA. Tell your aunt she can take her son and his family in. Location doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s \u201cfor family\u201d right? The dog thing is a little concerning though if you plan on having kids in the future or if you want to have family/friends over that have kids. But that\u2019s neither here nor there.\n\nThe family can go stay in a long term hotel for 6 weeks if they want, or your aunt can take them in, so many other options than disrupting your life for 6 weeks. When I guarantee they ain\u2019t paying you any rent or buying food, cleaning, yardwork, etc", "OP and their husband both work from home so how do you expect them to do their work with unruly children running around terrorizing their dog.  It is an unfortunate situation but OP is not able to help.", "yep, you're right. somehow missed that line. Totally agree, all bets are off once the abuse sets in.", "Nta making them homeless?  Then their mom just also making them homeless since they aren't moving in with her.", "Anybody that\u2019s yelling and screaming can open their wallets. NTA", "It\u2019s a thought situation but NTA", "NTA.  Uh no.  No locking up the dog - he's in HIS home.  Next thing you know they would be demanding you put the dog down when he snapped at one of the kids.  Hell no.", "Yta", "NTA - do NOT let them set foot in your house. At all. They're already acting entitled to YOUR HOME. Once they get in, they'll make your life hell and refuse to leave. It will be expensive, time consuming, draining and possibly, your dog might get 'lost' or sold to some random while you're out. Not to mention putting immense strain in your marriage. Not worth it.", "I think they have a new thing Called Air B &B's.  Short term rentals.   Try them for cousin and family.", "Why doesn't your cousin give them money for a hotel or air bnb?", "Good for you."]}
