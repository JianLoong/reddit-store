So I said that I would have to choose the children. \n\nMy girlfriend first stared at me in disbelief and asked really? \n\nI said that I can't even imagine making such a choice but ultimately yes. \n\nThis made her very upset with me and she said that she can't believe I would say that. We argued back and forth and I tried to say that it's not because I don't love her but she wouldn't hear it. She said that I was supposed to say that of course I would save her and that I could at least lie to her. I don't like lying, especially not to those I love and cherish, but she didn't appreciate it. \n\nShe's currently sitting quiet and the last thing she said was that she isn't sure who she is together with. I haven't changed my mind and it feels like such stupid argument since it would never happen, but I feel terrible and I didn't want to hurt her feelings.
