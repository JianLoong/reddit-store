{"id": 15208, "submission_id": "12s82y8", "title": "AITA for saying I would have to save \"tens of children\" over my girlfriend?", "selftext": "I dont even remember how we got into this discussion but somehow me and my girlfriend started talking about if you would rather save your partner or multiple children from certain death, while sacrificing the other, as a hypothetical scenario. And I love my girlfriend very much, more than anyone in this world. I'm sure I will marry her one day and I'd give my life for her if I had to. \n\nBut also, in such an outrageous scenario, I feel like you have to consider the lives of the children, their loved ones and what an impact that would have as well. So I said that I would have to choose the children. \n\nMy girlfriend first stared at me in disbelief and asked really? \n\nI said that I can't even imagine making such a choice but ultimately yes. \n\nThis made her very upset with me and she said that she can't believe I would say that. We argued back and forth and I tried to say that it's not because I don't love her but she wouldn't hear it. She said that I was supposed to say that of course I would save her and that I could at least lie to her. I don't like lying, especially not to those I love and cherish, but she didn't appreciate it. \n\nShe's currently sitting quiet and the last thing she said was that she isn't sure who she is together with. I haven't changed my mind and it feels like such stupid argument since it would never happen, but I feel terrible and I didn't want to hurt her feelings. \nShould I have handled the situation differently?\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: Things have now been resolved. Luckily it did not take all that long although it involved quite a bit of crying between the both of us.\n\nI need to make one thing clear, it wasn't she who initiated the question or that she \"laid a trap for me\". We got sidelined into it by discussing fictional characters and stories and somehow we ended up asking ourselves the question above.\n\nBut I'll cut the unnecessary details, my girlfriend admitted that her thoughts and actions were rash and that she wasn't fair to me. She knows that it doesn't mean that I love her less or that she isn't important to me. \n\nShe is bipolar and has had outbursts before although she also has been through plenty of therapy and training in dealing with her emotions. I had never experienced anything this extreme with her but it was because this time the topic struck a nerve. She's been in multiple abusive and non-loving relationships before, where she would never feel like she was worth any priority. But she also knows that it was unreasonable to think like she did.\n\nI'm probably somwhere on the autistic spectrum since I frequently have trouble understanding people in depth and what exactly they're thinking and feeling and what I'm supposed to say. As a lot of you said, I shouldn't have engaged in this topic to begin with and I hope I can take that with me and learn from it. But I'm also very glad that me and my partner were able to communicate with and understand each other and I will always be grateful for having that in our relationship.\n\nThanks for your comments.", "created_utc": 1681934196, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s82y8/aita_for_saying_i_would_have_to_save_tens_of/", "score": 222, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
