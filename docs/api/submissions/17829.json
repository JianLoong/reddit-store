They pace around Dr waiting rooms and are constantly letting the front desk know they are still waiting! They are pacing around outside whatever establishment they want or need,  yelling into their phones because they're clearly just so much busier than everyone else there. Their problem seems to be a lack of both patience and foresite.", "Sure, and in retrospect, I should have been clearer.\n\nIt\u2019s not her job to tell him how to take care of himself.\nIt IS her job to tell him when something is bothering her (and vice versa).\n\nThe article points out that she never said it was bothering her, she just moved the glass a few inches. \n\nSo much bullshit could be skipped if people actually talked to each other instead of playing games", "I like how he's not answering.", "He \"helps\" with *almost* all his free time. I wonder what his wife does with her free time while he's solely responsible for their kids. She's just so much better at it!", "It's your surgery. You secured the appointment, you found yourself a ride, and you can find someone to watch your kids. I don't understand why this is a big deal to you. Just make a phone call or two.", "You think your sister, who has FIVE children, wouldn\u2019t be a valuable resource for recommending babysitters? Do you even try to help your wife with any of the kids\u2019 logistics? YTA", "INFO: on the timeline between when you asked your wife to drive you and when she asked you about about a babysitter, when did you first think about the kids and what they\u2019d be doing during your appointment?", "You are wasting your life working so much and you will regret it when you\u2019re older", "So you expect your wife and HER family to take up YOUR job as a parent.", "You seem so incredibly passive about everything and it is so, so childish. \"Welp, I guess I should have just asked my mom then\". No, you should have had a discussion with your wife about this *at the same time as you were asking your wife about picking you up*. THAT would have been the adult thing to do. Functional adults do not just \"assume\" other people are going to take care of all the details regarding their life events. They take the initiative and make sure everything is taken care of. Your wife isn't your personal assistant going around making all the arrangements in your life, and treating her like that is not fair and will lead to her resenting you.\n\nStop acting like a child. If you are old enough to be a parent, you are old enough to communicate with others like an adult should and make arrangements WITH your own spouse. \n\n>Parenting is hard, but that\u2019s what we signed up for\n\nNot when you are leaving the hard parts to your wife, which is pretty clear you've been doing.", "I'm proud of your wife for leaving you.", "Have you called the hospital and asked if children are allowed in the waiting room? That's not allowed in many places, especially if the child isn't the patient.\n\nAnd have you been practising with your children to be sure they can sit still and quietly for multiple hours in new places?", "That\u2019s pretty bold of you to say you signed up for it when its clear you don\u2019t actually understand how much work parenting entails.", "This isn't just about your wife having to watch them. It's also about forcing two very young kids to be bored out of their minds in a place that is very much not a friendly or comfortable environment for anyone, let alone children.", "If the roles were reversed you know damn well she would have arranged for her mom watch the kids so all you had to do was drive. YTA.", "If the roles were reversed I'm telling you right now she would never ever ask you to bring the kids.", "OP I think you guys need some marriage counselling.\n\nFrom a female outside perspective, you said you \"assumed\" your wife would have her family help her take care of the childcare. This is a surgery for you, and she is making all of the arrangements. If she had eye surgery coming and assumed that you would drive her AND take care of the kids AND organize it all for her, how would that work out? Would you feel upset she is putting all of the onus on you? Would you feel like she is taking advantage of you, maybe feel she should have planned this better?\n\nRole reversal and being open minded enough to see someone else's point of view can go a long way. It could save your marriage.", "And you still think you somehow aren\u2019t the asshole? \n\nOh buddy", "I think it is great because in this area there really aren't a lot of transportation options other than cars.  A lot of people getting the surgery are older and may not have another person that can drive them, as I didn't.  They run vans for several hours per surgery day so I imagine that adds up to a lot of patients that they wouldn't otherwise get.  Win for both surgery center and for patients.  One of my drivers was a retired gentleman that loved his job.  He got to meet and talk to a lot of people and pick up extra income.", "I had mine in a hospital a few years ago.  But when the surgery centers specifically doing cataracts first opened in Chicago, they would get you in a limo.  That's what my dad had.(side note: my mom had her cataract surgeries so long ago, she was in the hospital for about 3 days)", "Bot\u00b2", "I can\u2019t even describe how laughable this comment is. Get some perspective dude", "Block me next!", "Wrong, sorry", "Garbage take. Whoever needs the surgery and needs the drive, should be the one to schedule babysitting for the kids. He\u2019s not being slammed for being a man, he\u2019s being slammed for refusing to find babysitting for his kids, not caring that having two toddlers in a waiting for an hour is not a good idea, and not being able to see past his own BS. If the genders were swapped, I would still think whoever is getting the surgery and needs the ride, should be getting their shit in order. If you\u2019re defending his garbage behaviour based on \u201cOh if the genders were reversed\u201d then you\u2019re just as short-sighted as he is. \n\nNot to mention his edits clearly say there\u2019s more going on; this isn\u2019t the first instance where he\u2019s been a dog shit husband, clearly.", "At least you are going off of real personal experience! I haven't had the same experience (I haven't seen a difference between genders) but I'm glad you're not going off whatever fake tiktok drama you've seen", "It seems that it never occurred to him that those things need to be done and they take time, effort, and mental energy. He can't buy a clue and he's doubling down after being told he's the asshole. I wish his wife could see this. She deserves to know about this attitude and what it means for the rest of their marriage.", "He assumed his wife would be watching them and taking care of him.", "This right here. My local children's hospital still specifies that the ONLY children allowed on the premises are patients. Even for office visits, no siblings allowed. I can't imagine most hospitals/surgical centers are any different.\n\nYTA, OP for not communicating about logistics", "He's not a malicious \"manosphere\" type of AH we see a lot of here, more like, oblivious. He can work on his interpersonal skills/mental load and come out a better person for it. I hope he does.", "So laughable you can't come up with a counter argument. get blocked :)", "Nope I'm right, but if you want to stay in denial by my guess. get blocked :)", "It's very telling that he doesn't do child care because otherwise he would know that toddlers in a waiting room for hours was going to be a bad idea.", "Tbf, I wasn't the one suggesting \"swapping the genders\" I just disagreed with how the commenter above me did.\n\nApart from that I'd agree with you for the most part, except ideally, parents should be working together not leaving it to one or the other. And if op isn't pulling his weight, then yeah, he needs to step up.", "Well, she apparently has left him and is staying with her parents, so it seems like she's managed to figure some things out, at least.", "yup.", "Yes I\u2019m aware. I want to know when he first considered his kids (if at all).", "GET BLOCKED oh my god XD", "He was surprised that he had to arrange for the kids last minute. It hadn\u2019t entered his mind until then. So, he does nothing and assumes she\u2019ll take care of them or have them wait in the waiting room.  Re-reading the post, he had to schedule his surgery (all by himself)and didn\u2019t even think to plan for transportation to and from or after care. Wife is at the end of her rope and he\u2019s starting to figure it out.", "Good for her! Maybe that space will give clarity. The sheer amount of emotional and mental labor that two toddlers, a household, and a road cone of a partner causes is tremendous and it only gets worse as the children get older and do things outside the home.", "Probably calls parenting \"babysitting\".", "Or grocery shopping"]}
