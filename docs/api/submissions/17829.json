Obviously, you shouldn't have assumed that y'all would bring the kids along even if the facility allows that.\n\nWe have done all of the above options, including me bringing the kids along while waiting for my spouses vasectomy to be done.

Your wife certainly doesn\u2019t need to wait, just give a ride. The ride is not the problem though my dude. Neither the wait. The problem is that your wife obviously feels overburdened. One toddler on any given day is a lot. Two can be nightmare fuel. You say you tell your wife you\u2019re having bro time. What does she get? I\u2019m betting her days look like 5am-10pm non stop. Cranky dictators, three meals, never ending tiny human dishes. Laundry. Trying to keep a clean house - impossible. Stress. Feeling like you\u2019re not living up to her own ideals. Or sleeping enough. Something lacking. Talk to your wife. For what it\u2019s worth I don\u2019t think you\u2019re intentionally being TA here.

Their play groups and other activities? Have you put work into thinking about where they're going to go to school?", "So two points there. First she asked you to ask your Mom. I assume your Mom isn\u2019t a stranger to your kids AND she is who you asked to drive you? Second if you understand how mentally draining kids are, how do you not see how awful that would be in a waiting room.

You don\u2019t have anything going on?\u201d I guess typically I do leave it to her to organize instances to find a sitter. Mostly, because she has a strong support network: MIL, FIL, and sister. I have my mom who is not as strong a support in my life, my sister who has five kids, but she has to drive to  take to and pick up from school - in other words busy. I don\u2019t have a lot of people", "My mom is already watching my brothers kids that day. I guess I should have just asked her to watch my kids anyway. Having my mom watch 4 toddlers instead of the two seems like a big ask. I know watching 2 kids in a waiting room is tough, but if the roles were reversed that\u2019s honestly what I would have done. Parenting is hard, but that\u2019s what we signed up for.", "that's probably why she's annoyed then, you scheduled an appointment you needed and asked her to take you but its still her responsibility to make sure the kids are cared for. \n\nyou can pay sitters? and that's kinda a crappy excuse even if you needed your inlaws to do it there is nothing stopping you from picking up the phone and asking them for a favor so it's one less thing your wife has to do in terms of childcare", "And how often does she go out with friends?", "What about all the other work to organize things for your kids, planning meals, grocery shopping, making doctors appointments, making sure they have clean clothing, making sure they have clothing and shoes in the right size and that things they have outgrown are taken out of rotation, that there are diapers and wipes in the house and the diaper bag is stocked with everything you need before an outing? Do you take on any of that mental load or is it all your wife\u2019s job?"]}
