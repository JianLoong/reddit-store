You both should have communicated better. A quick discussion of where the kids would be when you discussed getting a ride would have done wonders in this situation. For putting the onus of the kids and what to do with them while you\u2019re in surgery solely on your wife YTA.", "info: what does it look like when you get \"upset\"??? cause your comment about wife fleeing to stay w/ her parents cause you got \"upset\" over this...red flags abound.\n\nyta tho.", "YTA, we may be bunch of strangers, but that\u2019s telling if your wife is staying with her parents. You are obviously not listening!!! Your wife isn\u2019t being heard. She didn\u2019t feel that she is being heard. You may hear her talking, but have you really paid attention what she is saying???  She doesn\u2019t want to take care of kids while tending to you after surgery. Waiting in the wait room for 2-3 hours is stressful enough, but to add toddlers that she has to make sure they are behaving properly would be exhausting.  Are you narrow minded or something? Open your damn eyes.", "just read the comic and the comments below it are absolutely appalling and literally feeding into the problem. good on that recommendation though the comic was very informative", "I don't have kids and I know that, seems pretty obvious", "A new level of cluelessness. Who in their right mind would think it is okay to take two toddlers to a surgery thereby making them hang out in the waiting room??? Even a quick 30-minute surgery is too long for that. Not to mention the stress on the wife who then has to deal with two toddlers AND a spouse recovering from surgery. \n\nI'm surprised OP was competent enough to father two children given how little thought he gives to anything...", "Yup and OP's edit just reinforces that. Still can't recognize the imbalance.", "This is exactly it: YTA. I bet your wife would never do this to you OP", "Not to mention that its a difficult setting to keep kids calmly occupied in. Home is familiar, they have all their things, they have a decent idea what the limits are, and if they get loud so what? Most medical officers have little to nothing for kids to stay occupied, it\u2019s a smaller space, and there\u2019s other people around who don\u2019t want to be disturbed. A hour is a long time to try and manage two toddlers in that setting.", "Thank you, I appreciate this", "Thank you for this", "She came up with a solution. The problem came when it was time to do what he agreed to do and chose to do the exact opposite because it was easier for OP to deal with. He LITERALLY says it's easier to have someone else drive him than to watch h his kids. He completely left out the fact that she's at her parent's house now because of his lack of ability to follow basic instructions, which is affecting her negatively.", "He didn't communicate at all. How hard is it to know that caring for two toddlers and someone who just had surgery isn't something anyone wants to do? Stop weaponizing your incompetence", "As a mother, I am so grateful for my marriage when I hear stories like this. I have a real partner, a parent who is equally involved, who does not think forcing our children to sit in a waiting area, annoying  and stressing out other patients is good enough. Who doesn\u2019t pat themself on the back because they would be willing to subject our kids to that irritation and actually cares about everyone\u2019s happiness, not just who is currently keeping them from putting their fingers in electrical sockets.", "Yes. Mindful to do better next time", "You would be ok corralling two toddlers in a hospital waiting room for a couple hours? Keeping them quiet and well behaved because it a waiting room not a playground?\n\nAnd what if there is some kind of emergency that pushes your appointment back?", "The problem is you don\u2019t think about what\u2019s best for your kids. Sitting in a waiting room for an hour is miserable for them, your wife, and likely any other patients there. If you were willing to do that, it\u2019s just because you were too useless a parent to think \u2018is there a better plan I could make for my kids?\u2019", "But have you taken care of them in a place where they need to be quiet and bored for an hour?", "Wow do you want an award? So you watched them in a waiting room with nothing to do? Also that is bad parenting wanting your young children to be stuck in a waiting room when they could be at home", "So I happen to work in eye surgery, idk what procedure OP had, but we tell people to be ready to wait 2-3 hours. The average surgery is 10 minutes, but it can take time to get the eye to dilate properly, get and IV, answer all the questions, do all the checks, and that\u2019s all without something going unplanned in another case that delays the doctor. It\u2019s usually 1-1 1/2 hours by the time all is said and done, sometimes 45 minutes, but my point is that it\u2019s unpredictable and I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to sit there for the whole time with 2 babies.", "Considering the level of his involvement in child care/rearing, his \u201ccompetence\u201d to father those children probably didn\u2019t take more than 30 seconds\u2026\n\nI feel for the wife. Raising 3 kids by herself.\n\nYTA OP. They\u2019re you\u2019re fucking kids. She\u2019s not your mum. \n\nGrow the fuck up.", "He just wanted people to tell him what he wanted to hear. This isn\u2019t the point of this topic and I hope he takes the comments that don\u2019t align with his views seriously.", "So when asked about who organizes the kids you think changing diapers, food and entertainment is all that consists of?", "Thank you for expanding on this. I drove my ex to his eye surgery and it was over an hour wait time during which people who were noticeably nervous and uncomfortable were entering and exiting the waiting room. Having kids being kids in that waiting room would have been a horribly cruel thing to subject the patients, doctors, and anxious families to.", "Your wife left and is staying with her parents? If so, a LOT is going on beyond this one gaff.", "Take this newfound knowledge, and go profusely apologize to your wife. If you are lucky she might come home. \n\nI am just blown away by the fact that you thought a hospital waiting room was an appropriate place for 2 small children. For that you get YTA, but hopefully you never do something like this again.", "Sure it is. I just have a feeling that his wife is angry that his mom and dad never step up. It does seem very unfair.", "I recently had cataract surgery.  The surgery center covers a large rural area, along with small to large towns/city.  They offered a ride program.  They have vans that go out all day, pick up people for surgery and then take them home.  They will help you in the van and then into your house after surgery because you are definitely loopy from the anaesthesia.  I cannot imagine trying to do that with young children, let alone sitting in the waiting room for two hours trying to keep them entertained.", "\u201cWell, I \u2026 but\u2026 I mean\u2026 I would\u2026 I try to..,. wait, is that one even a real thing?\u201d  -OP, probably", "Yep.", "I think its more that op leaves it to their wife to handle all that stuff. That op wife is tried of that. Plus we don\u2019t know if op mil is burnt out from helping.", "Is your Uber your momma?", "I had the same surgery. I was in recovery for about 3 times as long as the procedure. (Those were some goooooood drugs, LOL.)", "That\u2019s really cool, we primarily do cataract surgery so I\u2019m very familiar lol. I\u2019m in a city, we don\u2019t offer anything like that with the rides, and idk how exactly that would work liability wise (we usually suggest the responsible party stay with them for the afternoon, I\u2019m aware most probably don\u2019t) but I feel like that would be a good thing to offer, we sometimes have to cancel surgery because people don\u2019t always have someone to drive them.", "So, no. \nAs we all already knew. She LITERALLY asked you to do something so that it's easier for you both and you CHOSE to do something that was easier for only you. That's why she's annoyed.  That's why YTA, because you acted selfishly!", "Wow, that's bad. That means this was the last of many things going wrong for her.\n\nI feel for you, but this is a make it or break it moment. If she's willing to give it another shot, make sure you're proactive about changing and working on your partnership and you're listening to her. \n\nHope it works out for you and you come out of this stronger, it seems you're not being malicious but that there's still a lot going wrong.", "If the roles were reversed, your wife would have most likely made all the arrangements so all you had to do was drive\u2026", "Have you ever watched 2 small children in a waiting toom for any length of time?\nEspecially post-Covid, where there's going to be a policy of no toys or books...\nWhat do you think other anxious relatives may think of sharing the space if/when the children get fractious?   \ud83e\udd14", "\u201cParenting is hard\u201d dude you weren\u2019t even willing to try to find a babysitter", "You don't know because you never asked. You agreed to do one thing and did something COMPLETELY different based on YOUR assumptions instead of facts. In turn, you make things harder for your wife by not following through on what you agreed to do.\nThey could've had some nice cousin time. But now she's at her parent's house bc you acted out of selfishness.", "Lol! Our surgeons can do as little as 3-4 minutes, so I totally believe recovery took longer than surgery. I had a different procedure (ICL) and so I was in the OR for about 30 minutes (they do one eye, go to another or and do a different surgery while you\u2019re re draped and prepped, then come back and do the other eye)since I\u2019m an employee they I guess gave me the courtesy of completely snowing me so I don\u2019t remember much. My sister took me to the store after my surgery and I kept reaching for bottles of marinade saying I was thirsty \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "I\u2019m guessing OP is going to say \u201coh plenty of times\u201d which is probably twice a year and he\u2019s calling her every hour asking when she\u2019s coming home", "Or thinks playdates are the same thing as going out with friends without kids", "I would guess the same"]}
