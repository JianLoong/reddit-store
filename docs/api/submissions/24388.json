{"id": 24388, "submission_id": "15o60dq", "title": "AITA for charging my friends rent then keeping the money for myself?", "selftext": "This will be my first year in college. When I got accepted, the 1st person I told was my uncle. We\u2019re very close because he took care of me when I was little because of my parent\u2019s crazy work schedules. Anyway, my grades were good enough to get me in but not enough to get me any scholarships. That means I\u2019ll have to take out loans for tuition and work for my expenses. When my uncle found out, he said I should just concentrate on school instead of working but my dad (his brother) said that money is tight right now so my parents can\u2019t help me out as much as they want to. My uncle has investment properties all over the place so he said it\u2019s not a big deal for him to buy another one near my campus, which he did. Then he had contractors renovate the house so emerging in there is brand new. He even had them install a bay window in the master bedroom just for me and I got to pick out everything else like the carpet and counters. He told me he wants me to concentrate on school and not work. Instead, I can be his landlady and rent out the other 3 bedrooms and keep that money to fund my expenses.\n\nI have a group of friends who are attending the same school so I made a deal with them. Studio apartments are going between $900-1500 (not including utilities) around the campus with the expensive ones being closer. My uncle\u2019s house is one street over from campus so I can literally walk to class everyday. I\u2019m charging my friends $700 per room or if they double up, $350 per person per month and split utilities evenly. They all jumped at the offer and no one asked any questions until recently when one of them asked me how much the overall rent was. I was honest and told them about my uncle and our deal. That blew up in my face because now everyone of my friends are calling me greedy for charging them rent then pocketing the money. We\u2019re all in a huge fight and they all want to either pay nothing or \u201cthrow a couple hundred\u201d in for utilities. \n\nI cried to my uncle but he said now that I\u2019m an adult, I need to make my own adult decision. He\u2019ll stand by my decision. I don\u2019t want to lose my friends but I don\u2019t want to disappoint my family with bad grades either. I thought I was being fair with rent but literally all of my friends are calling me a greedy AH.\n\nUpdate:\n\nThank you for reading my post and giving me advice. I went to my uncle, this time without crying, and told him some of the advice given on here and asked him for his advice. This time he didn\u2019t tell me to make my own adult decisions and told me he was waiting for this conversation. This is what we agreed to do.\n\nI texted all of my friends (former?) and told them because of the arguments and hurt feelings, we can no longer live together. My uncle offered to work out a lease for me in the beginning but I refused because these were my friends. Because no one signed a lease, we didn\u2019t have to break any. I was worried about them suing but my uncle said that the law in our state requires anything to do with real estate be in writing. Unlike other situations, real estate deals cannot be oral so I\u2019m good. This time I took him up on the offer of creating a lease for me to have new tenants sign.\n\nWe spent the morning researching rent prices and making ads. My friends and I made the agreement at the beginning of summer. Now that there\u2019s only a couple of weeks left until school starts, we found almost nothing within 3 miles of campus. There were some options further out but nothing was cheaper than $1,200 for a shared room and that was in an old house with window A/C units and 5 miles from campus. When the house was being renovated, my uncle had central air and heating installed. We came to a rent price of $1,300 and placed ads in several places including FB. Within an hour, I got a dozen messages. It\u2019s 4 pm now and I literally have over 100 messages. Many of them don\u2019t even need to see the house in person. Based off of the pictures and location, they want to submit their application today. Some even offered to send me the deposit and 1 person said her dad will pay me the full semester amount today.\n\nMy uncle gave me some advice that was exactly what you guys said. Never mix money with friends or I might lose both and never tell anybody my business. He told me not to lie, just keep quiet.\n\nThanks again and have a great weekend you wonderful people!", "created_utc": 1691752370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15o60dq/aita_for_charging_my_friends_rent_then_keeping/", "score": 11043, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sure there are plenty of other people who would want those rooms if your friends refuse to pay, and if they're not happy with the price they must leave.

You pay someone for housing, then they keep the money for themselves. The fact you were the landlady instead of somebody else isn't really relevant. And it sound you were giving a great deal - 200$ discount (at least) for a place right across from collage. They should be grateful that their friend is offering them such a good deal, instead of being greedy leeches and upset over nothing. \n\nNTA the slightest, but unfortunately your uncle is right. Part of being a landlady is dealing with leeches who don't want to pay. Maybe try evicting them and getting decent people and make it clear you are the landlady.", "NTA.   \nYour uncle is being incredibly generous to you, because you are his family. Your friends are not.   \nThey could move out\u2026. And you can easily refill those rooms with students from uni, and be more upfront \u201cMy uncle owns this, he has asked me to sublet the rooms out at fair market rate\u201d if it helps. Your friends can choose to move out, or stay, but bitching about you won\u2019t change things.   \n\n\nThey are likely to start skipping rent now I am sorry to say. Justifying it in their minds that you don\u2019t need it.", "NTA your friends are the Greedy ones tell them to kick rocks and find a better deal somewhere else bc they won\u2019t be able to.", "You should inform them that they are indeed right, and that you feel terrible, and take swift action to rectify the situation by serving them all with notices to vacate \n\nNTA. You priced the rent using sound rationale and you\u2019re friends accepted it as fair rent. They should be seeing it as irrelevant who gets the money in the end. They need to grow up. \n\nAnd I guarantee non of them would be willing to give any of you the equivalent amount of \u201cfree stuff\u201d every month because they had access to it. Any of their family own a business? Why aren\u2019t they providing $2100 of product from that business each month? You could all sell it and split the proceeds. Idiots\n\nHOWEVER, it\u2019s totally natural and expected that they would feel resentment in that situation. I would. So I won\u2019t call them the bunch of free loaders that they are. They just need to remember that life\u2019s not fair and nobody owes them anything. They should know this by their ages but sometimes people forget these basic tenets of reality. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think you can avoid the resentment. You\u2019re uncles right. Time to make some choices. It\u2019s unfortunate none of your group is seeing things from your perspective. May be a sign of fundamental disconnect between you and your friends and possibly you should consider if these relationships are best suited for you going forward. \n\nYou\u2019d be better served to rent to people you don\u2019t know.

Yes absolutely they are so NTA however I don\u2019t think their reaction is surprising \n\nI\u2019d probably feel bit uncomfortable if I had a job and was paying for say a meal out with you and feeling like regardless how we split it I was technically paying and OP didn\u2019t actually have to do any work to get money from me \n\nAnd hey I know that\u2019s an entitled feeling and that I\u2019d  be the AH cause landlords have responsibilities etc, I just mean it unsurprisingly creates a bit of a weird dynamic and in this situation I\u2019d either have been completely upfront or probably just avoided renting out to close friends", "NTA. Your friends are trying to freeload. You are very lucky to have a family member providing you such an opportunity. Your good fortune however, is not your friend\u2019s good fortune. If you are in charge of the house, then it is your decision to run the house as you see fit. People often don\u2019t take very good care of houses that they aren\u2019t responsible for. What if you have to put money into the house to fix it up after school?  Charge rent for the rooms. Remind your friends that they are getting rooms below market value.

Be sure you\u2019re saving that money, and be good to your uncle.", "NTA if they\u2019re unhappy they are free to leave and find another home but business is business and friendship is separate from that. They are not entitled to free rent from you or your uncle. Never disclosed your finances to anyone in the future it always backfire, someone gets jealous or expects you to pay for everything.

This is your work and they want it free? If they get it free it defeats the purpose of what your uncle planned for you. You will have to go get a job to pay for them to live with you. No friend would ask that. Have a meeting and let them know if they\u2019re unhappy with the accommodations you\u2019ve provided they can leave by the end of the week. Ask who would like to leave. Whoever is staying rent remains the same, paid in full on time or they\u2019ll be evicted. No mentioning this again and no arguments in the home or eviction.

You're friends are entitled and dumb. They should be thanking you everyday. You're uncle is amazing.

Is it ok to charge your roommates money to live in your uncle's house? Of course yes. That's exactly what your uncle's intention was. \n\n2. What should the rent be? Comparing a studio apartment to a room in a house sounds a bit like apples and oranges. I'd go find out what the market rate for roommates in a house would be. You can adjust up or down from there as desired.\n\nYou guys are young and probably learning/experiencing for the first time what is like to sign leases, pay rent, and do all those adult things. It probably feels weird to have your friend as your landlord.  But aside from giving your landlord a face, it's just the same. Money goes somewhere, which provides someone with income. That's how it works.\n\n I'd talk it through with them. You weren't trying to hide anything. You're not taking advantage of them. They would be paying someone.  If they're not comfortable with the fact that \"someone\" is their friend, then maybe they should move somewhere else. (You'd have to look at whether you want to let someone out of their lease. Can you find someone else to move in to cover that spot?) And going forward, it would be good to have a \"here's the deal\" convo before signing up next year's roommates. \n\nOne more thing. Prepare yourself for the day when a friend says they can't pay the rent for whatever reason.

Tell them that the rent stays the same, but you would understand if they want to leave and find another accomodation.\n\nSee what happens.", "NTA, you gave your friends a good deal which is affordable. If they want to move out and pay double the price they can. \n\nHowever if I was in your situation I would of been upfront with my friends told them the situation that my uncle bought the house and I\u2019ll be responsible for any issues. \nI would probably give them cheaper rent then $700 so it would cover my expenses.  If they don\u2019t cover utilities I would keep it at $700 per room", "NTA", "NTA. Your friends are your tenants and need to pay the rent you set for them OR need to move out ASAP.

When I got accepted, the 1st person I told was my uncle. We\u2019re very close because he took care of me when I was little because of my parent\u2019s crazy work schedules. Anyway, my grades were good enough to get me in but not enough to get me any scholarships. That means I\u2019ll have to take out loans for tuition and work for my expenses. When my uncle found out, he said I should just concentrate on school instead of working but my dad (his brother) said that money is tight right now so my parents can\u2019t help me out as much as they want to. My uncle has investment properties all over the place so he said it\u2019s not a big deal for him to buy another one near my campus, which he did. Then he had contractors renovate the house so emerging in there is brand new. He even had them install a bay window in the master bedroom just for me and I got to pick out everything else like the carpet and counters. He told me he wants me to concentrate on school and not work. Instead, I can be his landlady and rent out the other 3 bedrooms and keep that money to fund my expenses.\n\nI have a group of friends who are attending the same school so I made a deal with them. Studio apartments are going between $900-1500 (not including utilities) around the campus with the expensive ones being closer. My uncle\u2019s house is one street over from campus so I can literally walk to class everyday. I\u2019m charging my friends $700 per room or if they double up, $350 per person per month and split utilities evenly. They all jumped at the offer and no one asked any questions until recently when one of them asked me how much the overall rent was. I was honest and told them about my uncle and our deal. That blew up in my face because now everyone of my friends are calling me greedy for charging them rent then pocketing the money. We\u2019re all in a huge fight and they all want to either pay nothing or \u201cthrow a couple hundred\u201d in for utilities. \n\nI cried to my uncle but he said now that I\u2019m an adult, I need to make my own adult decision. He\u2019ll stand by my decision. I don\u2019t want to lose my friends but I don\u2019t want to disappoint my family with bad grades either. I thought I was being fair with rent but literally all of my friends are calling me a greedy AH.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Light, because you're all young and figuring things out. I agree with other commentors that the friends are being selfish, in part because it's their first time renting and they don't understand the good deal they are getting. They agreed to pay rent and should continue to pay it for as long as they live there.\n\nHowever, I do think you should have been upfront with them that you're the property manager BEFORE they moved in. Not because it changes the cost of rent, but because there's now a power imbalance between you, as the person in charge of the property, and your friends, as the renters. They've only just found out that this power imbalance exists, and it's understandable that they're feeling thrown off by it. Many people prefer not to enter into business contracts with friends and family because of the tension it can cause (much like you're experiencing right now). If I were your friend, I would have wanted to know that you were the property manager so that I could discuss the benefits/risks to our friendship before moving in.  \n\n\nIf you want to try to mend these friendships, you could apologize and say you wish you had communicated your role with them sooner. Mention the market rates and that you were giving them a deal because you were so excited to live with them. But also hold to the rent price that you agreed on! This is your money for food and expenses. If they're not comfortable with the arrangement anymore, they're welcome to rent somewhere else. And moving out doesn't have to be conveyed as an insult--this can just be an option that you're giving them because you value the friendship and want them to be comfortable. (Although do go over the lease with your uncle to make sure that is, in fact, an option you can give them).  \n\n\nIt could be that you continue to live together. It could be that they make a big stink about it and then move out. Your friendships may or may not mend. Either way, give yourself some grace. These are the sorts of lessons you learn when you're on your own as an adult for the first time. It sounds like you have a great family support system to help guide you. \n\nGood luck with this situation and with college!", "YTA\n\n1 - You weren't upfront and honest with your friends about the fact you're using them for pocket money. They thought you were helping them organize a group house living situation, they didnt think that you only invited them to live with you so you could take their money, Of course that's going to breed resentment.\n\n2 - It sounds like you are not even giving your friends a good deal on rent. Studios rent for as low as *$900* in your neighborhood? They *cap out* at $1500? And you are charging $700+utilities for a bedroom in a shared house - likely a child's size room as you have the master and likely with shared bathrooms. By comparison, rent for a studio in my city is $1800-2500, and you can find bedrooms in a shared house in a nice neighborhood *here* for $700. You should do market research on the rental price for a house where you live, and then divide that by number of bedrooms and set the rental rates proportionately by bedroom size, privacy, and amenities.\n\n3 - You could rent the rooms in your home to strangers instead, but you benefit from having your friends there. Most landlords have to spend a long time setting up advertisements, writing contracts, running background checks, vetting tenants for their reliability and cleanliness and their compatibility for living with you. If the tenant doesn't work out, you are kind of screwed. So it's not like you're doing them a one-sided favor. This was much easier and lower risk for you than needing to look for tenants.\n\n4 - You didnt put any work into this house. You didnt put any risk into it. If you needed their rent money to cover the mortgage or unexpected repairs, that would be understandable! But it was gifted to you, completely for free. And of course you are not obligated to extend that kindness to others. Your friends have no claim to the gifts you've received. But you should consider how the kindness of your uncle has been helping you tremendously in life, and then think about how you could be a better person by using your good fortune to help the people that you call your friends, instead of using them just to better yourself.\n\nIf I were you, I would apologize to them about not having been honest from the start. I would research what the actual price for a comparable room rental would be (again, studios aren't comparable). Then, I would offer them a 25%-50% discount from the going rental rate, because you're benefitting from renting to them rather than a stranger, it's good to value your friendships, and it's good to pay it forward. And it's also fair for them to acknowledge when they're getting an actually good deal, which a discounted rate would be. If they're not comfortable with that price, that's ok and they can move on. But it's also possible that there's too much anger and resentment to repair this, and you may have an easier time waiting until they move out and rent to strangers instead.", "YTA - You led them to believe that they were renting with you (which implies a formal rental agreement and various protections under the law) instead of from you. Then when asked, you told them \u201cOh hey, there are no protections in place. I am living here free and you are paying me to live with me\u201d. Yes they are going to be pissed, and they have every right to want a decrease in how much they pay you because they now can be booted at a moments notice and have zero recourse. Or if they decide to, they can claim squatters rights and that could make your life a whole lot more difficult.\n\nYTA for misleading them in the first place, and YTA for getting upset when they didn\u2019t like that you misled them.

You have involved money in your friendships and that can be messy. \n\n Obviously this is speculation, but if your friends are working for that money while also taking classes and then have to hand it over for you to live job free just because you lucked out and have an uncle with a house - that breeds resentment. I hope they all come from families of similar wealth or they have family in state. If they don\u2019t, crossing you may come with the threat of homelessness for them. What if one of your friends can\u2019t afford rent or just refuses to pay? Will you evict them? If they have a college party and damage the house that is going to come between your friendship. Typically, tenants and landlords are not chummy. There\u2019s a degree of separation and it\u2019s a business transaction. Living with someone already complicates a friendship so I cannot imagine the impact being their landlord will have.

You were given an incredible advantage by someone who loves you, your say these are your friends, what would it have cost you to pay it forward and give them the same?

It's your duty that they are aware of this before signing or even moving in. I know you haven't started college yet but this is literally basic informed consent. I hope you aren't going into research because that is a big no. If you haven't given them contracts then they are basically like moving a friend or family to move in with you. There is no obligation. Yes, you can take steps to kick them out but they technically don't owe you rent. Verbal contracts are contracts but deception is fraud which can cancel such contract.  \n\n\nThink about how you want to proceed with this. Would you rather live with friends or with strangers.

For 4 rooms (including himself) hes charging $2800 which i guess is in the ballpark, maybe a bit of a deal since its newly renovated. But as a friend id assume a bit of a discount. Again hard to compare cities. He should look at the market rate and maybe cut back like 20% for friends seems very reasonable to me. If they dont like it he can get tenants at full price. \n\n\nAdding that in these situations you should always tell your friends what the arrangement is.

Light ESH all around.\n\nI can relate to OP, in a way. Growing up, my parents owned a restaurant, so, when my friends and I would drop by for lunch, I'd go into the back to grab something for myself and was never expected to pay my share. My friends paid for their food (and some drinks and snacks sometimes), but my parents would come up to the front to chat and then just take a few bucks from them for what would've been a $10+ meal. \n\nThe key difference is that they were aware of the power dynamic. Yeah, I got a better deal than them, but they got a decent one and knew that they were paying my parents for the food they were providing. Sure, some of that money came back around to me in the form of, you know, my parents feeding and housing me, but it was never direct. I would have been TA if I just pocketed $8 from each of them and paid my parents back the $5 they'd have charged them, thus earning a passive income off the \"great deal\" my friends were getting.\n\nOP's fallen far into that category, just on a much larger scale. They're not TA for being privileged, just for not being open. \n\nThat said, I'm also not super into the friends' heel-turn once they saw where their money was going. They were okay with the deal when the uncle was getting the money (when he could've thrown it into a fund for OP anyway), but are suddenly not okay with it when OP is getting the money? If it was an unfair price, they should've walked away before agreeing to it or negotiated. \n\nI can see how renting 1 room for $200 less than a studio apartment may seem like an unfair deal, but maybe these friends valued the idea of living in a house with friends more than finding the most bang for their buck.

The fact that they know OP doesn't mean they automatically get to exploit that friendship for their own ends without OP getting compensated.   \n\n\nThey're actually the bad friends here.", "As someone who rented a room in an Airbnb for 6 weeks while i looked for an apartment I whole heartedly agree.  My Airbnb landlord was making way more bank than most private landlords.   \n\n\nShe owned like 5 properties, all Airbnb, and lived in a bedroom in one of them.\n\nThis was her only job. I asked why she didn't just rent the normal way and she said she made 3x as much as market rent most months.", "Even worse is that these corporations that own thousands of properties in an area will purposely leave housing vacant to drive up the rent in their occupied properties.", "Corporate investment, private investment and property management companies are all ruining the housing market and going to cause the homeless  epidemic to just get worse", "A lot of kids don't truly understand that, though. I certainly had no idea how much bullshit went into maintaining a house until I bought one - I understood the concept, but the true cost in time and money was pretty shocking.", "I completely agree but just to add nuance. Housing as right does not mean you as a private citizen are required to house people. It means that the government has the duty to provide housing to those who seek it. I still agree that it\u2019s pretty juvenile to expect to live somewhere for free. You were just walking real close to the \u201ccommies are putting homeless people in my house\u201d. That\u2019s just not really the case being presented by anyone"]}
