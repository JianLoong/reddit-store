When I got accepted, the 1st person I told was my uncle. We\u2019re very close because he took care of me when I was little because of my parent\u2019s crazy work schedules. Anyway, my grades were good enough to get me in but not enough to get me any scholarships. That means I\u2019ll have to take out loans for tuition and work for my expenses. When my uncle found out, he said I should just concentrate on school instead of working but my dad (his brother) said that money is tight right now so my parents can\u2019t help me out as much as they want to. My uncle has investment properties all over the place so he said it\u2019s not a big deal for him to buy another one near my campus, which he did. Then he had contractors renovate the house so emerging in there is brand new. He even had them install a bay window in the master bedroom just for me and I got to pick out everything else like the carpet and counters. He told me he wants me to concentrate on school and not work. Instead, I can be his landlady and rent out the other 3 bedrooms and keep that money to fund my expenses.\n\nI have a group of friends who are attending the same school so I made a deal with them. Studio apartments are going between $900-1500 (not including utilities) around the campus with the expensive ones being closer. My uncle\u2019s house is one street over from campus so I can literally walk to class everyday. I\u2019m charging my friends $700 per room or if they double up, $350 per person per month and split utilities evenly. They all jumped at the offer and no one asked any questions until recently when one of them asked me how much the overall rent was. I was honest and told them about my uncle and our deal. That blew up in my face because now everyone of my friends are calling me greedy for charging them rent then pocketing the money. We\u2019re all in a huge fight and they all want to either pay nothing or \u201cthrow a couple hundred\u201d in for utilities. \n\nI cried to my uncle but he said now that I\u2019m an adult, I need to make my own adult decision. He\u2019ll stand by my decision. I don\u2019t want to lose my friends but I don\u2019t want to disappoint my family with bad grades either. I thought I was being fair with rent but literally all of my friends are calling me a greedy AH.", "created_utc": 1691752370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15o60dq/aita_for_charging_my_friends_rent_then_keeping/", "score": 295, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sure there are plenty of other people who would want those rooms if your friends refuse to pay, and if they're not happy with the price they must leave.

You pay someone for housing, then they keep the money for themselves. The fact you were the landlady instead of somebody else isn't really relevant. And it sound you were giving a great deal - 200$ discount (at least) for a place right across from collage. They should be grateful that their friend is offering them such a good deal, instead of being greedy leeches and upset over nothing. \n\nNTA the slightest, but unfortunately your uncle is right. Part of being a landlady is dealing with leeches who don't want to pay. Maybe try evicting them and getting decent people and make it clear you are the landlady.", "NTA.   \nYour uncle is being incredibly generous to you, because you are his family.

And you can easily refill those rooms with students from uni, and be more upfront \u201cMy uncle owns this, he has asked me to sublet the rooms out at fair market rate\u201d if it helps. Your friends can choose to move out, or stay, but bitching about you won\u2019t change things.   \n\n\nThey are likely to start skipping rent now I am sorry to say.

You priced the rent using sound rationale and you\u2019re friends accepted it as fair rent. They should be seeing it as irrelevant who gets the money in the end. They need to grow up. \n\nAnd I guarantee non of them would be willing to give any of you the equivalent amount of \u201cfree stuff\u201d every month because they had access to it. Any of their family own a business? Why aren\u2019t they providing $2100 of product from that business each month? You could all sell it and split the proceeds. Idiots\n\nHOWEVER, it\u2019s totally natural and expected that they would feel resentment in that situation. I would. So I won\u2019t call them the bunch of free loaders that they are. They just need to remember that life\u2019s not fair and nobody owes them anything. They should know this by their ages but sometimes people forget these basic tenets of reality. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think you can avoid the resentment. You\u2019re uncles right. Time to make some choices. It\u2019s unfortunate none of your group is seeing things from your perspective. May be a sign of fundamental disconnect between you and your friends and possibly you should consider if these relationships are best suited for you going forward. \n\nYou\u2019d be better served to rent to people you don\u2019t know.

Yes absolutely they are so NTA however I don\u2019t think their reaction is surprising \n\nI\u2019d probably feel bit uncomfortable if I had a job and was paying for say a meal out with you and feeling like regardless how we split it I was technically paying and OP didn\u2019t actually have to do any work to get money from me \n\nAnd hey I know that\u2019s an entitled feeling and that I\u2019d  be the AH cause landlords have responsibilities etc, I just mean it unsurprisingly creates a bit of a weird dynamic and in this situation I\u2019d either have been completely upfront or probably just avoided renting out to close friends", "NTA. Your friends are trying to freeload. You are very lucky to have a family member providing you such an opportunity. Your good fortune however, is not your friend\u2019s good fortune. If you are in charge of the house, then it is your decision to run the house as you see fit. People often don\u2019t take very good care of houses that they aren\u2019t responsible for. What if you have to put money into the house to fix it up after school?  Charge rent for the rooms. Remind your friends that they are getting rooms below market value.

Be sure you\u2019re saving that money, and be good to your uncle.", "NTA if they\u2019re unhappy they are free to leave and find another home but business is business and friendship is separate from that. They are not entitled to free rent from you or your uncle. Never disclosed your finances to anyone in the future it always backfire, someone gets jealous or expects you to pay for everything. Next college year get different people to live with and don\u2019t tell them your private business.\n\nWhat you were charging us fair and much less then they could find alone and that was already a great favour.

This is your work and they want it free? If they get it free it defeats the purpose of what your uncle planned for you. You will have to go get a job to pay for them to live with you. No friend would ask that. Have a meeting and let them know if they\u2019re unhappy with the accommodations you\u2019ve provided they can leave by the end of the week. Ask who would like to leave.

Is it ok to charge your roommates money to live in your uncle's house? Of course yes. That's exactly what your uncle's intention was. \n\n2. What should the rent be? Comparing a studio apartment to a room in a house sounds a bit like apples and oranges. I'd go find out what the market rate for roommates in a house would be. You can adjust up or down from there as desired.\n\nYou guys are young and probably learning/experiencing for the first time what is like to sign leases, pay rent, and do all those adult things. It probably feels weird to have your friend as your landlord.  But aside from giving your landlord a face, it's just the same. Money goes somewhere, which provides someone with income. That's how it works.\n\n I'd talk it through with them. You weren't trying to hide anything. You're not taking advantage of them. They would be paying someone.  If they're not comfortable with the fact that \"someone\" is their friend, then maybe they should move somewhere else. (You'd have to look at whether you want to let someone out of their lease. Can you find someone else to move in to cover that spot?) And going forward, it would be good to have a \"here's the deal\" convo before signing up next year's roommates. \n\nOne more thing. Prepare yourself for the day when a friend says they can't pay the rent for whatever reason. How are you going to handle that?", "NTA you had your family help you out not your \"friends\" imo but I can understand that it's hard to get multiple friends out of your circle like that", "NTA, but be careful, those aren't your friends (probably).\n\nTry and explain the situation to them, that this was a gift to YOU by your uncle, and that you gave them what you thought was a very god deal. Tell them that the rent stays the same, but you would understand if they want to leave and find another accomodation.\n\nSee what happens.", "NTA, you gave your friends a good deal which is affordable. If they want to move out and pay double the price they can. \n\nHowever if I was in your situation I would of been upfront with my friends told them the situation that my uncle bought the house and I\u2019ll be responsible for any issues. \nI would probably give them cheaper rent then $700 so it would cover my expenses.  If they don\u2019t cover utilities I would keep it at $700 per room", "NTA", "NTA. Your friends are your tenants and need to pay the rent you set for them OR need to move out ASAP.

When I got accepted, the 1st person I told was my uncle. We\u2019re very close because he took care of me when I was little because of my parent\u2019s crazy work schedules. Anyway, my grades were good enough to get me in but not enough to get me any scholarships. That means I\u2019ll have to take out loans for tuition and work for my expenses. When my uncle found out, he said I should just concentrate on school instead of working but my dad (his brother) said that money is tight right now so my parents can\u2019t help me out as much as they want to. My uncle has investment properties all over the place so he said it\u2019s not a big deal for him to buy another one near my campus, which he did. Then he had contractors renovate the house so emerging in there is brand new. He even had them install a bay window in the master bedroom just for me and I got to pick out everything else like the carpet and counters. He told me he wants me to concentrate on school and not work. Instead, I can be his landlady and rent out the other 3 bedrooms and keep that money to fund my expenses.\n\nI have a group of friends who are attending the same school so I made a deal with them. Studio apartments are going between $900-1500 (not including utilities) around the campus with the expensive ones being closer. My uncle\u2019s house is one street over from campus so I can literally walk to class everyday. I\u2019m charging my friends $700 per room or if they double up, $350 per person per month and split utilities evenly. They all jumped at the offer and no one asked any questions until recently when one of them asked me how much the overall rent was. I was honest and told them about my uncle and our deal. That blew up in my face because now everyone of my friends are calling me greedy for charging them rent then pocketing the money. We\u2019re all in a huge fight and they all want to either pay nothing or \u201cthrow a couple hundred\u201d in for utilities. \n\nI cried to my uncle but he said now that I\u2019m an adult, I need to make my own adult decision. He\u2019ll stand by my decision. I don\u2019t want to lose my friends but I don\u2019t want to disappoint my family with bad grades either. I thought I was being fair with rent but literally all of my friends are calling me a greedy AH.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If she\u2019s doing her job, maintaining the house and everything, she\u2019s not freeloading and not being a slumlord.\n\nOP, NTA. Probably could\u2019ve been dealt with better, but hindsight is 20/20.", "She's not a freeloader. She's a landlord. That's how rental properties work. Landlord gets an income from charging rent to people who live in a property.\n\nHave you heard of people during the Great Depression or WWII or whenever who would rent a room in their house to someone. They'd call the renters \"boarders\" but it's basically the same thing. Not a new concept.", "But it's HER uncle tho.", "I am so confused.\n\nThis is a mutual understanding with full consent between 2 parties. If the uncle wants to give her an apartment and make her his landlady, that is his decision. I don't see how this is relevant to the judgement. \n\nShe is a landlady. Period. The deal could be offered to strangers with a more standard (and thus higher rate) and she would still be receiving money from them and keeping them for herself as is her legal right to do so. She merely extended to her friends first with a lowered market rate. \n\nOp, this is why some people don't mix business with friendship and even with family.", "I see why you say that but you\u2019re wrong", "Managing a property is a job. This is quite generous pay, but it\u2019s still a job. And her uncle is not stepping in to solve a problem that is part of the job. OP is very fortunate, but not a freeloader.", "I think the spirit of this is the right direction - but you\u2019re right about the lying part. These things always come out. \n\nI\u2019d explain that given the market rate, rent/utilities is less by x% and say your sorry if they feel this isn\u2019t fair and you\u2019ll understand if they feel they want to move out as a result. They will learn real quick. \n\nBtw - I hope OP has a written rental agreement with them.", "Agreed. And next time, don\u2019t rent to friends. Make sure there\u2019s a contract. The friends don\u2019t seem to understand this is a revenue generating property set up to fund your college education not theirs and you are not obligated to help them out financially at all. You\u2019re already giving them a break and that\u2019s as much as you can do since this **is** your \u201cfull ride scholarship.\u201d", "Or they were just stupid and thought their friend did all the work in finding a place. \nBut a recently renovated college house is pretty hard to come by. My experience is that 75%of the time the floor is always sticky", "The point of the post is the uncle doesn't tet the money, OP does.", "$700 is for a studio apartment. Not the comp of a house with roommates, which would be much cheaper.", "Since when is it acceptable to fleece your friends just because they\u2019re not amazingly savvy? \n\nIf I was selling say \u2026 an old television to a friend and knowingly racked up the price beyond what\u2019s standard, I\u2019d be an asshole whether friend agreed to the price or not. \n\nOP is clearly trying to do their friends a solid by renting it out under market value. But they may (or may not) have overestimated how much market value actually is. They\u2019ve never lived by themselves and assumed the cost of a room is the cost of a room, whether you\u2019re sharing or not. \n\nJust to be clear - If the friends were indeed overpaying, it wasn\u2019t done deliberately, hence the NTA judgement. But considering OP clearly was trying to offer a good deal, it\u2019s worth for OP to double check that the deal was actually as good as they thought it was.", "Money isn't everything. The OP would clearly be in a substantially more powerful position than them. Some people may accept that, some may not. It is their choice.", "She is getting free to stay somewhere for free and also collecting and keeping rent for a property she doesn't own and couldn't afford to buy. She is freeloaders off of her uncle's wealth.", "Considering she already cried to her uncle to, i dunno, force her perspective tenants to pay? Theres a really good chance she wont fix any issues with the property herself, but go straight to uncle, doubt she\u2019ll be willing to use her \u2018hard earned\u2019 money either. It\u2019s all conjecture sure, she might be a grown up here, but doubtful", "People freeload off family all the time", "She said in her post she doesn\u2019t want a job because that means she\u2019ll get bad grades. Its very unlikely she\u2019ll treat this a job. She\u2019ll be crying to uncle to handle everything", "Their friend absolutely hooked them up with a renovated place within walking distance of the campus. If not for his uncle, they'd all be in dorms or sticky-floored, dilapidated housing.\n\nNote that they haven't threatened to find a better deal elsewhere. They've only demanded they stay for free.", "So? Not sure what difference that makes to the person paying. Either it's a good deal for a living space or it's not. If not, they are welcome to find somewhere else.", "Rent isn't based on who gets the money. You pay for housing for a price you think it's fair. Why on earth is it only fair if it goes to the uncle, but not OP? That's not how rent or any kind of business deal works. \n\nThat's why they say you should never do business with friends. They can't handle it. OP is learning a big lesson. I am amazed how many people don't get it.", "I don't know that they are being fleeced though.  That is my point. \n\nIt sounds like a good deal to me, but I'm not in their city, so who knows.  But any research OP can do, the friends can do too.  She didn't MAKE them take the deal.  She offered one.", "Lil jealous there, are we??", "Her uncle told her to do it, dumbass. You're as entitled sounding as the damn friends.", "You aren't freeloading if someone gives you something and it's their damn idea. So her uncle hooked her up because he loves her. Who gives a shit? It's none of your business. It's none of their business. She doesn't owe anyone a damn thing. Y'all are mad at some 18 year old you're jealous of. Fucking pathetic.", "She's in an apprentice program with her uncle, learning real estate management and gets free housing and the rent she sets and collects is her income. There's nothing wrong with that. She charged a very fair rent.", "No, her uncle is basically paying her for her college studies. She studies and learns and he pays the rent for doing so.", "Hm. You have a point.\nWonder if OP would answer this.\nWould their rent go toward repairs and whatnot for the house, as it should, through her being the landlord, or would she get her uncle to do everything again and still be pocketing the cash?\nDoes she have companies lined up for emergency repairs? If the heat goes out? If she\u2019s doing her job, I do stand by what I said. But it does seem like her uncle\u2019s being responsible and pushing her to be as well.\n\nDo they even have a proper contract?", "I\u2019m not in their city (or their country) so I\u2019ve not got a reference point if it\u2019s a good deal or not based on the amount of dollars. *But* I know OP looked at studio prices as their point of reference. I know OP isn\u2019t renting out a studio but a room in a house share. I know that house shares are usually cheaper than studio apartments. It\u2019s reasonable to assume that there *might* be a discrepancy here. \n\nI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re (accidentally) being fleeced either. That\u2019s why I said it\u2019s worth *checking*. And I\u2019ve already explained why I don\u2019t give a scooby that she didn\u2019t *make* them take the deal.", "Accurately calling out a situation is being jealous?\n\nI have no issue working to support myself rather than leeching off of the wealth of relatives.", "Yes. Hence her freeloading off of his wealth.", "So if there is an issue, she calls the maintenance guy and pays him? I doubt it. Five bucks says she calls her uncle. \n\nThe rent isn't hers. It is her uncle's. She doesn't own the property.", "That all sounds like a job, and according to OP, if she has a job and works while in school she\u2019ll get bad grades. She probably hoping nothing will go wrong so she doesn\u2019t have to do anything. \n\nI\u2019m also guessing no proper lease, otherwise her perspective tenets should have known their \u2018landlord\u2019 was living in the house. Tenants have rights that differ when the landlord is on property or off", "So a gift from a family member is free loading? I feel bad for you that you think that and I won't elaborate why.", "The world is stacked up against us. Getting help is not leeching off. I work and support my self as well but I Al\u2019s know that my life would have been a lot less stressful and difficult if I had help. As long as people acknowledge that privilege is not something everyone has access to I don\u2019t see a problem. I just hate people that had a lot of help and act like others are lazy if they haven\u2019t made it.", "That word doesn\u2019t mean what you think it means lol", "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.", "That's just your conjecture and not a part of the question. Her uncle might do the same thing he did when she called about the rent issue: you're an adult, figure it out. You're literally making up a situation to be mad about. Get a grip.", "\"A gift\". \n\nYes getting free rent and about $2k a month for nothing is freeloading. Particularly so she doesn't have to *shudder* work. \n\nThis isn't a birthday present or graduation gift. It is ongoing support.", "She is literally doing it so she doesn't have to work even though she could.\n\nShe has a rich uncle who can pretty much give her thousands of dollars a month without expecting anything in return.

It's his $ and if that's the type of college support he wants to provide-  great. Who tf are you?? I can already tell the type of person I'm dealing with. So I'm not gonna break it down to you how college funds work and how people earn an education with the support of family.", "The brother is picking up the slack the parents can't afford to. Uncle Awesome came in and said \"Hey, I think you should focus on your studies and what you're paying for in terms of schooling, so I got your back on where you're living. You can also rent out the additional spaces and use that for living expenses instead of passing it off to me because again, I want you to focus on school.\"\n\nIf their parents had done the same thing, it wouldn't be freeloading either. It's a familial gift. They are maintaining the property for uncle while they're living there and going to school. They don't get to keep the house when they're done. The house is not a gift. It wouldn't be any different from the house having already been bought/ready for a tenant and uncle offering it.", "You are making up pieces of information. Obviously you're projecting from your own life.. Your arguments are assumptions.", "It\u2019s all about usage. Freeloader is used in situations where the person is expecting handouts. It\u2019s not used in situations where the person is offered something and they accept. If you\u2019re going to go straight dictionary definition, then anytime you accept a gift or let someone buy you dinner you\u2019re freeloading.", "You are right in that, per the technical definition, she is a freeloader. However, that term definitely has negative connotations, and is almost always used in the such a way that they\u2019re taking advantage of someone else. Since that isn\u2019t the case here (the uncle is freely giving OP this house for her use), it still doesn\u2019t fit the situation even if it\u2019s technically the correct term. That\u2019s why you\u2019re getting so much pushback.", "The exchange is that they concentrate on their studies and take care of the place. And it's written in the OP more than once and quite clearly. \n\nConcentrating on ones studies???\n\nGood advice don't you think?", "There is something given to him in exchange, his niece will get an education and his family will grow more prosperous for it. There are more things of value than simple physical objects. \n\nSome invest in objects, some invest in people.", "I never said he couldn't provide the support or that he should stop. I just said she was a freeloader. If it is what is best for her, she can go for it. But she is the freeloader in this situation.", "The problem is the inherent implication that this is meritocracy. She has to earn way less to succeed than her friends, yet her friends are freeloaders because they werent privileged. Using your privilege to increase your wealth at the expense of their friends, and then cutting them a deal on an insanely inflated rent market might not make you a freeloader, but it does make you an asshole. This is how the rich get richer and there are no systems in place to justify or balance it.", "What am I making up? She clearly says working is an option and was planning on it until her uncle let her stay there for free.", "What am I making up? She clearly says working is an option and was planning on it until her uncle let her stay there for free.", "It seems the word doesn't mean what you think it means. Definition doesn't say anything about expecting it. \n\nThe difference for freeloading from simply accepting a gift is relying on the support and it happening on a consistent basis. \n\nGetting help for rent for one month because an unexpected issue came up and drained your finances isn't freeloading. Consistently being unable to pay your rent and needing help is. \n\nShe is accepting free money and board so she doesn't have to work. That is freeloading.", "If she doesn't like the negative connotations, she could get a job and pay the reduced rent.", "That isn't an exchange. An exchange is he gives her something, she gives him something.", "Sure. But it is still freeloading. Is OP going to be paying back her uncle later? I find it unlikely. So she isn't giving something in exchange. \n\nIf OP has an issue with being called what she is, maybe she should just work. Seems like she wants the benefits while being in denial of the freeloading."]}
