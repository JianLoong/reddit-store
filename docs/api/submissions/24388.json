When I got accepted, the 1st person I told was my uncle. We\u2019re very close because he took care of me when I was little because of my parent\u2019s crazy work schedules. Anyway, my grades were good enough to get me in but not enough to get me any scholarships. That means I\u2019ll have to take out loans for tuition and work for my expenses. When my uncle found out, he said I should just concentrate on school instead of working but my dad (his brother) said that money is tight right now so my parents can\u2019t help me out as much as they want to. My uncle has investment properties all over the place so he said it\u2019s not a big deal for him to buy another one near my campus, which he did. Then he had contractors renovate the house so emerging in there is brand new. He even had them install a bay window in the master bedroom just for me and I got to pick out everything else like the carpet and counters. He told me he wants me to concentrate on school and not work. Instead, I can be his landlady and rent out the other 3 bedrooms and keep that money to fund my expenses.\n\nI have a group of friends who are attending the same school so I made a deal with them. Studio apartments are going between $900-1500 (not including utilities) around the campus with the expensive ones being closer. My uncle\u2019s house is one street over from campus so I can literally walk to class everyday. I\u2019m charging my friends $700 per room or if they double up, $350 per person per month and split utilities evenly. They all jumped at the offer and no one asked any questions until recently when one of them asked me how much the overall rent was. I was honest and told them about my uncle and our deal. That blew up in my face because now everyone of my friends are calling me greedy for charging them rent then pocketing the money. We\u2019re all in a huge fight and they all want to either pay nothing or \u201cthrow a couple hundred\u201d in for utilities. \n\nI cried to my uncle but he said now that I\u2019m an adult, I need to make my own adult decision. He\u2019ll stand by my decision. I don\u2019t want to lose my friends but I don\u2019t want to disappoint my family with bad grades either. I thought I was being fair with rent but literally all of my friends are calling me a greedy AH.", "created_utc": 1691752370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15o60dq/aita_for_charging_my_friends_rent_then_keeping/", "score": 2847, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sure there are plenty of other people who would want those rooms if your friends refuse to pay, and if they're not happy with the price they must leave.

You pay someone for housing, then they keep the money for themselves. The fact you were the landlady instead of somebody else isn't really relevant. And it sound you were giving a great deal - 200$ discount (at least) for a place right across from collage. They should be grateful that their friend is offering them such a good deal, instead of being greedy leeches and upset over nothing. \n\nNTA the slightest, but unfortunately your uncle is right. Part of being a landlady is dealing with leeches who don't want to pay. Maybe try evicting them and getting decent people and make it clear you are the landlady.", "NTA.   \nYour uncle is being incredibly generous to you, because you are his family.

And you can easily refill those rooms with students from uni, and be more upfront \u201cMy uncle owns this, he has asked me to sublet the rooms out at fair market rate\u201d if it helps. Your friends can choose to move out, or stay, but bitching about you won\u2019t change things.   \n\n\nThey are likely to start skipping rent now I am sorry to say.

You priced the rent using sound rationale and you\u2019re friends accepted it as fair rent. They should be seeing it as irrelevant who gets the money in the end. They need to grow up. \n\nAnd I guarantee non of them would be willing to give any of you the equivalent amount of \u201cfree stuff\u201d every month because they had access to it. Any of their family own a business? Why aren\u2019t they providing $2100 of product from that business each month? You could all sell it and split the proceeds. Idiots\n\nHOWEVER, it\u2019s totally natural and expected that they would feel resentment in that situation. I would. So I won\u2019t call them the bunch of free loaders that they are. They just need to remember that life\u2019s not fair and nobody owes them anything. They should know this by their ages but sometimes people forget these basic tenets of reality. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think you can avoid the resentment. You\u2019re uncles right. Time to make some choices. It\u2019s unfortunate none of your group is seeing things from your perspective. May be a sign of fundamental disconnect between you and your friends and possibly you should consider if these relationships are best suited for you going forward. \n\nYou\u2019d be better served to rent to people you don\u2019t know.

Yes absolutely they are so NTA however I don\u2019t think their reaction is surprising \n\nI\u2019d probably feel bit uncomfortable if I had a job and was paying for say a meal out with you and feeling like regardless how we split it I was technically paying and OP didn\u2019t actually have to do any work to get money from me \n\nAnd hey I know that\u2019s an entitled feeling and that I\u2019d  be the AH cause landlords have responsibilities etc, I just mean it unsurprisingly creates a bit of a weird dynamic and in this situation I\u2019d either have been completely upfront or probably just avoided renting out to close friends", "NTA. Your friends are trying to freeload. You are very lucky to have a family member providing you such an opportunity. Your good fortune however, is not your friend\u2019s good fortune. If you are in charge of the house, then it is your decision to run the house as you see fit. People often don\u2019t take very good care of houses that they aren\u2019t responsible for. What if you have to put money into the house to fix it up after school?  Charge rent for the rooms. Remind your friends that they are getting rooms below market value.

It\u2019s his home, he bought for this purpose - and they have benefitted. Be sure you\u2019re saving that money, and be good to your uncle.", "NTA if they\u2019re unhappy they are free to leave and find another home but business is business and friendship is separate from that. They are not entitled to free rent from you or your uncle. Never disclosed your finances to anyone in the future it always backfire, someone gets jealous or expects you to pay for everything. Next college year get different people to live with and don\u2019t tell them your private business.\n\nWhat you were charging us fair and much less then they could find alone and that was already a great favour.

This is your work and they want it free? If they get it free it defeats the purpose of what your uncle planned for you. You will have to go get a job to pay for them to live with you. No friend would ask that. Have a meeting and let them know if they\u2019re unhappy with the accommodations you\u2019ve provided they can leave by the end of the week. Ask who would like to leave.

Is it ok to charge your roommates money to live in your uncle's house? Of course yes. That's exactly what your uncle's intention was. \n\n2. What should the rent be? Comparing a studio apartment to a room in a house sounds a bit like apples and oranges. I'd go find out what the market rate for roommates in a house would be. You can adjust up or down from there as desired.\n\nYou guys are young and probably learning/experiencing for the first time what is like to sign leases, pay rent, and do all those adult things. It probably feels weird to have your friend as your landlord.  But aside from giving your landlord a face, it's just the same. Money goes somewhere, which provides someone with income. That's how it works.\n\n I'd talk it through with them. You weren't trying to hide anything. You're not taking advantage of them. They would be paying someone.  If they're not comfortable with the fact that \"someone\" is their friend, then maybe they should move somewhere else. (You'd have to look at whether you want to let someone out of their lease. Can you find someone else to move in to cover that spot?) And going forward, it would be good to have a \"here's the deal\" convo before signing up next year's roommates. \n\nOne more thing. Prepare yourself for the day when a friend says they can't pay the rent for whatever reason. How are you going to handle that?", "NTA you had your family help you out not your \"friends\" imo but I can understand that it's hard to get multiple friends out of your circle like that", "NTA, but be careful, those aren't your friends (probably).\n\nTry and explain the situation to them, that this was a gift to YOU by your uncle, and that you gave them what you thought was a very god deal. Tell them that the rent stays the same, but you would understand if they want to leave and find another accomodation.\n\nSee what happens.", "NTA, you gave your friends a good deal which is affordable. If they want to move out and pay double the price they can. \n\nHowever if I was in your situation I would of been upfront with my friends told them the situation that my uncle bought the house and I\u2019ll be responsible for any issues. \nI would probably give them cheaper rent then $700 so it would cover my expenses.  If they don\u2019t cover utilities I would keep it at $700 per room", "NTA", "NTA. Your friends are your tenants and need to pay the rent you set for them OR need to move out ASAP.

When I got accepted, the 1st person I told was my uncle. We\u2019re very close because he took care of me when I was little because of my parent\u2019s crazy work schedules. Anyway, my grades were good enough to get me in but not enough to get me any scholarships. That means I\u2019ll have to take out loans for tuition and work for my expenses. When my uncle found out, he said I should just concentrate on school instead of working but my dad (his brother) said that money is tight right now so my parents can\u2019t help me out as much as they want to. My uncle has investment properties all over the place so he said it\u2019s not a big deal for him to buy another one near my campus, which he did. Then he had contractors renovate the house so emerging in there is brand new. He even had them install a bay window in the master bedroom just for me and I got to pick out everything else like the carpet and counters. He told me he wants me to concentrate on school and not work. Instead, I can be his landlady and rent out the other 3 bedrooms and keep that money to fund my expenses.\n\nI have a group of friends who are attending the same school so I made a deal with them. Studio apartments are going between $900-1500 (not including utilities) around the campus with the expensive ones being closer. My uncle\u2019s house is one street over from campus so I can literally walk to class everyday. I\u2019m charging my friends $700 per room or if they double up, $350 per person per month and split utilities evenly. They all jumped at the offer and no one asked any questions until recently when one of them asked me how much the overall rent was. I was honest and told them about my uncle and our deal. That blew up in my face because now everyone of my friends are calling me greedy for charging them rent then pocketing the money. We\u2019re all in a huge fight and they all want to either pay nothing or \u201cthrow a couple hundred\u201d in for utilities. \n\nI cried to my uncle but he said now that I\u2019m an adult, I need to make my own adult decision. He\u2019ll stand by my decision. I don\u2019t want to lose my friends but I don\u2019t want to disappoint my family with bad grades either. I thought I was being fair with rent but literally all of my friends are calling me a greedy AH.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
