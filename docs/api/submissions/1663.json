{"id": 1663, "submission_id": "yo80u3", "title": "AITA for refusing to marry my friend to get her and her family the nationality?", "selftext": "I (27M) have recently settled down in a Western European country after receiving my citizenship. This has been considered a dream for many people in my country for ages since our economy is rather shitty and we\u2019re ruled by a communist dictator government (I will not name it because my family are still staying but there\u2019s only a handful of such nations). My friend (27F) has the opposite politic viewpoint and is an enthusiast supporter of the Party. We\u2019ve had our disagreements but since we all hang out in the same group we decided to just overlook them.\n\nA couple of weeks ago she started to act weird towards me, kind of flirty. I felt that something\u2019s wrong since she wasn\u2019t exactly into me ever and we\u2019re just too different. Asking around a bit then I found out her family is having legal troubles with their business. Her father refused to bribe some cops or local politicians something and his company is now under investigation for tax fraud. Most of their money is frozen and the only way her father can avoid jail time up to 10 years is that he has a foreign citizenship within the next year. If this is brought to court they are bound to lose since corruption is a very common thing and most likely evidences will be fabricated. So basically either bribing the court with an amount of money larger than what they have or obtain another citizenship will prevent him from serving time.\n\nI brought this up with my friend and she admitted. She also said if I agree she would pay my family quite an amount of money, around $50.000, which is still less than what they need to buy their way out of jail time from the judge. I straight up refused since this will greatly threaten my current citizenship, I will probably be departed if they found out I\u2019m faking a marriage, and (saying this might have made me the asshole) since her family adore the government so much they should gratefully accept what is given to them, in this case, the sentence, rather than trying to ditch the country and throw away the citizenship she\u2019s born with - her exact word when I told my friends I\u2019m leaving the country and have my old citizenship revoked. The conversation heated up, she slipped while arguing and said she was the one who ratted me out to the cops a year ago (I got into some legal problem then for saying and supporting statements against the government but they weren\u2019t able to do much since I was already overseas). I got mad and told her in that case I\u2019d happily see her old man rot in prison. Few days later my family called and said her family has came over to mine begging for our help, as well as told me to help out a friend in need. I replied that I\u2019m not risking myself, and I don\u2019t believe that people can change, especially not the snitches. AITA?\n\nTL;DR: Got my European citizenship, left my country along with the dictatorship, government - loving friend asked for a fake marriage to get her and family citizenship so that they avoid legal troubles. Said no and stood my ground.

She has already put you at risk of arrest for no reason.  She sounds pretty hateful and manipulative.  And this is the person that you are supposed to welcome into your home and risk your citizenship for?  The citizenship that you have in spite of her sociopathic behavior?  I would not let this nutbar anywhere near my life if I were you.  She will probably try to mess it up the second you give her an opening.", "NTA she is not to trust.

You receive some money, cannot accurately judge if this a decent amount since we don't know the countries involved, but context says it not a particularly large amount. They receive freedom from current legal troubles, plus foreign citizenship and any benefits that gets them. You put yourself at considerable risk while they can only benefit for a tolerable investment. They are asking for a lot while offering little, where I live we call this a scam. Your family is being utterly ridiculous to demand you give in and let yourself be taken advantage of.", "Your friend's situation is sad, but you would be foolish to risk your new citizenship for someone who previously betrayed you and put you in danger when it suited her. \n\nThis is what happens when evil rules and people choose to support it. Evil has no loyalty to anyone but itself. It is happy to use the people it needs, but will quickly turn on them the moment they are are no longer useful. Your friend and her family chose their side. They were content to let others be oppressed by their government and cheerfully supported it because it benefitted them. Now that the government has turned on them, they are experiencing the same fear that they happily let others experience.

They don't seem to have any qualms about breaking the law, so why don't they just pay the bribe?", "Oh hell no. Run. She made her bed now she can lay in it.\n\nNta at all of course.", "NTA.

Also I would be surprised if he could get citizenship through his daughter's marriage that quickly. It's usually a long and complicated process to bring your in-laws into another country. Of course I don't know the citizenship laws where you are. But I am an immigrant from the US to Australia and it wasn't until a few years after I was married that I was eligible for citizenship, and even though I have been a citizen now for 16 years I can't sponsor anyone in my family for citizenship.
