I told her I wasn't okay removing them, they're essential medical equipment and I'm not going to put myself in a position to affect my health just for some photos.\n\nMy sister complained to our mother and some of our friends, and they're all taking her side. They say it's no big deal if I just don't wear them during the wedding, but I don't see why I should.\n\nMom suggested I could move them to my stomach, but I've tried that before and find it incredibly uncomfortable. When I put a new sensor on, I'm stuck with it for 10 days until it expires and I can switch to a new one, and I don't want to be stuck with one on my stomach where it will bother me the entire time.\n\nThey're all complaining that I'm not willing to compromise at all, but I don't think my health should be an area where anyone can ask that I compromise at all.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676334533, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111our6/aita_for_refusing_to_remove_my_medical_equipment/", "score": 1317, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have to think that there is some deep, unexamined terror and possibly guilt about your illness going on there for her to be so cavalier about the devices that have effectively transformed her daughter's diagnosis from a death sentence into a manageable condition, but I don't know.\n\nI am sorry, OP.

The CGM monitors your blood sugar so you don't seize or DKA in the middle of her wedding. \n\n3. The devices are expensive, can only be obtained via prescription through the pharmacy, a medical supply company, or direct from manufacturer (although I think they phased that last one out), and only come with EXACTLY enough in the box for the intended month(s) supply.

Looking back I don\u2019t care if you could have seen my Dexcom because it\u2019s a huge part of who I am. Tell your sister to kick rocks if she cares more about her aesthetically pleasing wedding/photos than your well-being!", "Agreed. Especially when they\u2019re are multiple ways to address it that don\u2019t involve her risking her health. She could wear a long sleeve dress, have a shawl, or ask the photographer to edit them out. NTA, OP.", "You know what would ruin the aesthetics of the photos? A coma. Or a sweaty hypo. NTA", "And cut off these toxic people.", "My glasses stay right there on my face, tyvm. So I can actually see things around me. [This](https://youtu.be/AaYIV59rmDI) is what severe myopia looks like without eyeglasses.  (Actually, my vision was worse than that shown in the video. Without the glasses, I would have been legally blind.) They are assistive devices, just as much as Grandma's walker and Grandpa's oxygen tank.  \n\nOP is TOTALLY NTA.", "Or get some skin colored gauze/ribbon and wrap it around the area. That would be an ok compromise I think assuming OP doesn\u2019t need to constantly check the device", "Mine aren't Dexcom & Omnipod, they're Libre2 & Cequr, but I work in ECSE, with preschoolers who like to \"pick\" at things which aren't \"covered,\" and I've learned that a simple \"Flexible Fabric\"-type bandage/band-aid in the 2\"\u00d74\" size covers my devices well enough that they're not *too* visible, *and* since even the littlest ones understand the concept of bandaids covering \"owie(s)\" they tend to leave them alone.\n\nI know the Deacom is higher/sticks out a bit more than the Libre sensors do--but to make 'em less noticeable/visible, those fabric bandaids *might* just work--especially if it's just for the day.\n\nAnd best of luck to OP, I hope they find a great solution, and they're 100% NTA!!!", "I\u2019ve known people whose pumps stopped for an afternoon and they were incredibly sick, do not risk it and any good photographer can air brush that anyway if she is that ridiculous but I personally would simply bow out!", "is simple. people that dont rely on monitors might thonk others dont need it that badly and might do a day withouth. entitled much. :/ \nop doesnt have to waste the sensor and the pump just for the sister entitlement.", "Right? My niece is a type 1 diabetic and was just in another niece's summer wedding and who even cared if her pump or dexcom showed on her? In my family, we prefer our loved ones alive over photo aesthetics.", "It's pretty astounding. The bride could have asked way beforehand, before assuming. Also, short sleeve dresses and long sleeve dresses exist once you realize \"oh hey, it's a medical necessity.\" I just wouldn't attend the wedding but that's me, it's not everyone's taste.", "It's sooo stupid. Like what will the guests say if OP goes into hypo or hyper and doesn't have the devices so just fucking dies??? That can actually happen when you take insulin away from diabetics", "Who really, besides the bride, likes to look at other people's wedding photos, how many times and do we judge appearance so harshly.", "Thank you! Congrats on your wedding!", "There is a great episode of the new Babysitter\u2019s Club show on Netflix featuring something similar.", "Also a photographer can edit that out in like 2 seconds.", "I actually love the idea of decorating the monitors so they look all fancy but I don\u2019t know how that\u2019d fly with sis- seems kinda fussy and snobbish (otherwise she wouldn\u2019t think aesthetics are more important than her sisters health). \n\nWhy couldn\u2019t you just have a simple cover up with sleeves? They have plenty of formal looking scarfs/shawls/ over shirts, jackets what have you.\n\nFind one that goes with the dress, problem solved.\n\n(Note to sister: this is what is actually called a compromise, something that would work for both of you. Not just \u2018you do what I want\u2019.)\n\nNTA- it\u2019s your health needs vs. your sisters aesthetics. No comparison. If she\u2019s that worked up about it just have them edited out of the photos.\n\n\nUgh someone complaining that a person\u2019s medical devices will ruin their wedding pictures is just so gross and tacky. What would she think of a guest In a wheelchair or with a cast. Heaven forbid if anyone is rude enough to get seriously injured  or have some kind of accident or\nEmergency close to the wedding.\n\nNTA- sis is a bridezilla and anyone telling you you should sacrifice your health and comfort to cater to someone\u2019s aesthetics can take a flying leap.", "There are some nice looking patches meant to be placed over the sensor on Amazon which might work even better.", "It still boggles my mind. I don't tell my brother with asthma not to carry his inhaler because he literally needs it to save his life, not even once this has crossed my mind. I don't use the inhaler yet I don't assume he can do without it for a day. Yet you have a bunch of these people disregarding OP's life for a stupid godamn photo.\n\nI'm just flabbergasted.", "That's  more than  entitlement  it's  stupidity at its  finest.  Nta  op. Get your sister  a dictionary  and tell her to read necessary  medical  equipment", "I mean it's not even that hard to photoshop it out. Photoshopping out the device won't you know, endanger someone's life.", "\"Hey I'm not going to attend the wedding since I want to not die, thanks for asking tho.\"", "\"Compromise\" can also be OP declining to be a bridesmaid at all.", "Before that, black and white pictures!", "Before that, charcoal on cave walls!", "And ask about the closest hospital and how close an ambulance can get to the ceremony/reception just in case you mess up because youe not used to having to do this and will likely be focusing on and distracted by all the wedding activities.", "I think this pretty much every Bridezilla post which concerns pictures. It's like every problem comes straight out of the 90s where photoshop is a distant science fiction.", "That was my first thought too, hasn't OPs sister ever heard of photoshop?", "This is the answer! A 2\u201dx2\u201d item would be very easy to edit out. One click kinda vibe.", "I don't see a need to hide", "Honestly when I first met my boyfrien, I thought his dexcom was a sticker he got stuck on his arm", "and before that, people just solved the problem of not having their medical devices showing by dying of lack of medical care! (Sarcasm)", "I mean, the first known faked photo is from the 40s. The *1840s*.\n\nEditing 2 inches of arm to look like \"just arm\" in a darkroom is more difficult than using Photoshop, sure, but it's really not that hard for a pro photographer - one of my parents was a hobbyist in the 1970s and they could do it.\n\nPeople are just ableist asshats sometimes."]}
