I told her I wasn't okay removing them, they're essential medical equipment and I'm not going to put myself in a position to affect my health just for some photos.\n\nMy sister complained to our mother and some of our friends, and they're all taking her side. They say it's no big deal if I just don't wear them during the wedding, but I don't see why I should.\n\nMom suggested I could move them to my stomach, but I've tried that before and find it incredibly uncomfortable. When I put a new sensor on, I'm stuck with it for 10 days until it expires and I can switch to a new one, and I don't want to be stuck with one on my stomach where it will bother me the entire time.\n\nThey're all complaining that I'm not willing to compromise at all, but I don't think my health should be an area where anyone can ask that I compromise at all.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676334533, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111our6/aita_for_refusing_to_remove_my_medical_equipment/", "score": 202, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have to think that there is some deep, unexamined terror and possibly guilt about your illness going on there for her to be so cavalier about the devices that have effectively transformed her daughter's diagnosis from a death sentence into a manageable condition, but I don't know.\n\nI am sorry, OP.

Did I get that right?\n\nDoes your mother get that these devices are categorically and absolutely necessary to your continued life and health?  \n\nIf your sister was so interested in the \"look\" for her wedding, while still for whatever reason being offended by the sight of your devices, she could have either provided multiple dress options, or just gone with something that covered those oh-so-offensive devices.  \n\nAnd your mother - and you can tell her this from me, another mother - is such a disappointment.  \n\nNo one should hide crutches, or wheelchairs, or helmets (is that the correct term?) for tiny little people who need assistance in forming part of their skeletal systems.  No one should feel that they need to hide artificial limbs, or glasses, or any other thing that lets them survive and thrive.  That includes your devices.  I'm glad you have them, and that they contribute to your life and its quality.\n\nI hope you don't give in to this stupidity.  I have no idea why weddings bring out the worst in people, to include siblings and parents.\n\nYour sister can always, if she for whatever reason feels the need, have your devices shopped out of the wedding photos.  But you should never be made to feel that your devices are something to hide - they keep you alive.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit - spelling", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't just bow out as bridesmaid. I wouldn't attend the wedding at all. People who love you would never make such a request.", "NTA They can be edited out.", "NTA, Your mom should know that it's 10 days, unless you're old enough for tech to have changed since you lived with her.", "NTA. Those two devices are essentially two of YOUR ORGANS. It is incredibly inappropriate of anyone to ask you to remove vital organs, or relocate them in an uncomfortable way, for the sake of aesthetics.", "NTA. Tell your sister the only person who will give a damn about her wedding photos will be her and her husband and they aren't going to be looking at your arms.", "NTA. Sister was OK to ask. She's the AH for pursuing it. And she ran to Mom, oh my. Your friends don't seem to think you collapsing during the middle of the ceremony is a big deal. Your sister sounds like she'd blame you if it happened.", "NTA - I wouldn't put my own medical needs above pictures. If your blood sugar levels aren't regulated right you can go into a diabetic coma and possible die..I wouldn't risk that for photos.\n\nI would tell your sister that she can as the photographer to Photoshop the device out or simple decline the invite to stand in the wedding...personally I would just decline and not go at all if your own sister is more worried about photos then your health.", "NTA.  They're pretty ableist and very rude.  And even if you could tolerate an uncomfortable placement for the duration of the event, those supplies are expensive!  You'd either wear it in the uncomfortable spot for 10 days and be miserable, or take the financial hit hit and waste one on the event.  I feel it's unreasonable to ask anyone to make modifications to their medical equipment for a wedding", "NTA. I have Type 2 with a CGM and pump. It helps me, but for you it\u2019s literally life-saving. Asking you to risk your life is unreasonable. Period.", "NTA  You need your medical devices. That's what photoshop is for if she doesn't want to see them in the wedding photos.", "NTA.  She can get them edited out when she gets the photo's if it's that much of an issue for her.", "NTA\n I can't believe your own sister and mother asked you to do this. Decline to be in the wedding. The nerve of some people. Good luck.", "NTA. Your sister knew about the devices before she decided on dresses. And she chose sleeveless. That\u2019s on her.", "NTA but you can place them in many other areas for 10 days. My grandson wears these also and he always has them under his clothes. Don\u2019t be an inflexible AH.", "So because it's your health, of course everyone is going to say NTA, but you are being very stubborn.  My niece wears these and you could move it somewhere for such a big event.   Power struggle,  jealousy,  attention? It's most likely something else going on.  I'm going with YTA", "ESH. Your sister for being dramatic about it and you for not just sucking it up for ten days so that your sister can have normal photos.", "yta. diabetic here. . let your dicom time out and replace it after wedding. use at test strip and injector for insulin. people have done it for years. you will survive. get over yourself. . or don't go. nothing that you are using is critical for you to live well. Bet you use the colored patches to show off your dicom too..", "My grandma uses the Dexcom and places it on her stomach, under her clothes. The video created by Dexcom to demonstrate how to use it also shows it being placed on the person's stomach. You could easily wear it under your dress with it making no difference in it monitoring your blood sugar. \n\nI can't comment on the pump.", "Photoshop isn't even needed! The sister can go out and buy a shawl for OP if she wants them covered \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd I wonder if she also demanded Gramma leave her oxygen tank at home because the tubes will ruin her precious pictures \ud83d\ude44", "THIS. WTH is wrong with your family that they don\u2019t care about your health?  A wedding is a busy, stressful event when your blood sugar could do abnormal things in response to the stress.", "NTA totally this, I had a photographer friend who could have photoshopped this in an instant.", "Photoshop isn't needed because it's kind of disgusting that the bride would want to hide the things that LET HER SISTER LIVE COMFORTABLY!", "Just gonna say the same thing!", "Yes. It would take just moments to photoshop out.", "The best part of these \"perfect\" pictures is, the couple is divorced in 2 years time", "I completely agree.  I can't understand the thought process of these crazy brides.  They supposedly care enough about someone to want them to involved with the wedding,  but then want them to change themselves if they're not \"perfect\" enough.  All for pictures that'll get looked at less and less as the years go by.", "Most photographers edit their photos too. Would it REALLY be such an endeavor for the bride to request the devices to be 'shopped? I'm so over these over the top bridezillas.\n\nNTA, OP", "This is the way, OP.  This is your compromise.", "I don't even get all this \"good picture\" nonsense. To me, a good picture is a honest picture. I'd like to see my family and friends as they are, because that's why I love them. Why would I want them to fake their health or personality? So that I can look at those pictures and have no stories to tell? I like to be reminded of that quirky aunt who loves to wear red, of that friend who made it although they broke a leg and had a hard time walking, or of the niece who rocked her feeding tube by including it as part of the outfit, etc. That's the stories you'll cherish in the end. Pictures should remind you of your own stories and a good time, not mimic a TV moment some teenage author made up.", "They wouldn't ask a paralyzed guest to be a bridesmaid in the first place, because the wheelchair would look ugly in the pictures.", "And before digital photography we had airbrushing.", "Your sentiment is absolutely right, but you didn't read the situation properly. Both devices are on OP's arms and she will be wearing a sleeveless dress. OP's family isn't worried about bumps under the dress, but actually seeing the devices. \n\nThat being said, the family would still be massive assholes for asking OP not to wear them in either situation.", "Honestly kids are the best, they always tell me my CGM looks super cool. My boyfriend's nephew says it looks like something Iron Man would wear.\n\nIf your son ever feels self conscious tell him his CGM makes him look like a superhero!", "Just wanted to say the first time I saw a CGM I thought, \"I wonder if that is for blood sugar, if it is that would be COOL.\"   I thought this because I've had a few friends who are T1 and many T2 relatives.  I've seen the sh@tshow that is pricks and injections and having a device to monitor is amazing.  \n\nYour son may not notice people with them but there are many out there - and there are many friends who think they have cool robot parts.", "I was going to add something like this.  My aunt used to tell me to take off my eyeglasses for photos.  Which I've worn since I was around 10. No. I'm not.  And it doesn't even compare to a glucose monitor and pump.", "This was my first thought. How's the wedding going to go if OP has a severe hypo or DKA episode?", "You can\u2019t say she\u2019s NTA but then call her an AH. That\u2019s not how this works\u2026 of course she can wear them elsewhere but it\u2019s not comfortable for her. She\u2019s not being inflexible. It\u2019s her body and her medical needs and her comfort. Photographer can photoshoot them out or she can pose in a way that doesn\u2019t show them. \n\nNTA from me, OP.", "It's just really uncomfortable for me to wear anywhere else. My skin gets irritated very easily and I've found my upper arm works best. Also you usually want to place them somewhere with a little bit of fat and avoid sticking them into muscle, and there aren't really many good spots for that on my stomach but it's easy on my arm.", "If she wears them in a different location, they have to stay there for 10 days. The other locations cause her physical discomfort. You really think she should have to be uncomfortable 24 hours a day for a week and a half straight just because her sister wants perfect photos of one day and apparently doesn't understand that photoshop exists?? Seriously?", "\"You're being very stubborn wanting to prioritize your health and comfort for 10 days over your sister's wedding pictures because she doesn't like being reminded you're diabetic.\"\n\nCool.", "Yeah. \n\nI have friends that wear these. They can be moved. Or even removed for a few hours. \n\nI\u2019m not understanding why OP won\u2019t move them to her thighs or remove for a 2 hours of aisle and photos? \n\nI mean they are fabulous. But 2 hours isn\u2019t a massive ask", "asking her to be in constant discomfort for a week and a half is not reasonable", "'Normal' photos? Ewww", "Wow. She should waste her insulin for some weddings photos that can be photoshopped? Lmao", "Oxygen is overrated after all...../s", "This was my thought. \"Compromise\" can be a shawl or wrap, not OP risking her health.\n\nI'd imagine a severe low incident or DKA would ruin the wedding far more than not fitting sister's picture aesthetic perfectly.", "Or just live.", "Sorry, totally my bad, the only diabetics I've met with insulin devices have had stomach pumps. Still, asking someone to remove them for wedding pictures is whack.", "What does your boyfriend think about all of this?", "If they're anything like the devices I'm familiar with, they can't be removed and replaced, and they're expensive.  Once they're placed, they're there for the duration (10 days, not 2 hours).  Placement can affect not only comfort but also accuracy and coverage for replacement if anything goes wrong (also, getting replacements is far from instant if you don't have enough backups).", "You can't just move them or take them off temporarily, you have to keep them in place until they expire.", "If you remove the sensor you have to replace it completely. No reason for OP to have to waste a sensor. \nI don't know about the pump, probably just needs to change the needle. Still an unreasonable request for a frivolous reason. \nNTA. Maybe find a compromise, a slightly different model of dress, or have a shawl over idk.", "I love when people like this say stuff like that. \u201cOh yea my friends have that\u201d YOU don\u2019t use it. Devices like that can\u2019t just be put somewhere for two hours and then replaced. That\u2019s not how it works. And that equipment is expensive. OP takes it off and she cannot use it again and that expensive piece of life saving medical equipment becomes useless and she\u2019d be wasting hundreds of dollars worth of insulin.", "You obviously have no idea about diabetics and insulin. You test your blood sugar and you inject how much you need.  Zero wastage. Same concept as an injector. Been doing it for 25 years.. i also have a dicom..again, it is a device of convenience. . and ALL she is losing is convenience.. and if she has to take off her dicom early, she can pick up a freebie at the drug store so not out of money.. still lyao ?", "No need to apologize. I still 100% agree with you. \n\nOne of my sibling's children is type-1 diabetic. Their insulin pump is in the abdomen, but they usually have the Dexcom sensor on their arm and only switch it to the abdomen during football season since it could more easily get ripped out of their arm.", "Depending on when the wedding is, she might not have that option. If it\u2019s already in, she\u2019ll be wasting it by taking it out for pictures. Why should she have to prick herself and inject herself when the device does it for her? She shouldn\u2019t have to remove anything. And by the way, I am a healthcare worker, most of my patients have had diabetes so I know good and well how it works.", "such a major inconvenience . 1st world problems. give me a break..and you know it if you are in Healthcare. she is the ah", "How does not wanting to put her health on hold make her TA? Please spell it out for me. Honestly. Because you\u2019re argument doesn\u2019t make sense to me. If OP had to have an oxygen tank would she be TA for having it during pictures? Or maybe if she was in a wheelchair, would she be expected to just pretend she could stand? Because those are things no one would want someone to do just for wedding photos. Those are things that are for people\u2019s health and what OP has is for her health. So asking her to put her health on hold, because \u201cthe photos will look ugly\u201d is ridiculous. If anything THE BRIDE should be taking pics on the side that doesn\u2019t have the device on it.", "explain to me HOW SHE IS PUTTING HER HEALTH ON HOLD ? Millions of diabetics do w/o these *convience* devices every day. Please educate yourself on the average life of  a diabetic.  ALL she has to do is test her blood sugar ( she has the equipment because you HAVE to calibrate the dicon) and inject her insulin. She has the gear just in case her  auto unit go south. Just because she is doing it manually, how in the heck is it even remotely equivalent  to your hypotheticsls ??  Just another comment..there are a bunch of other places on your body that you can put the dicon on other than the arm and stomach and she knows that."]}
