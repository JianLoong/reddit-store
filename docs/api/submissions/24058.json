Why wouldn\u2019t your husband feel betrayed his mom just assaulted his wife. Or at least that\u2019s how I see it.", "NTA. I don't care what age an adult is, that's assault. Press charges.", "NTA. In most places, it\u2019s up to the system wether to press charges or not. They changed those laws to protect victims of domestic violence. \nIn any case, if you have the option to press charges, you should. You were injured, yes, but most importantly, your baby could have been injured. What if you dropped him/her? And someone stepped or fell on her/him? That is unacceptable. Shame on your partner for not seeing that. Good luck", "Let me make it more clear and give a little more detail. MIL was giving attitude over something small and me and husband told her to stop being petty. She started screaming super loud saying we think we are grown (we are 25 and parents) and that we are disrespectful. Husband told MIL to stop always talking to me like that and that I was right. FIL randomly got really aggressive jumping toward me like he was going to attack me and multiple people were holding him back. During this while my husband was holding me trying to get me out of the door because of the chaos, MIL took it upon herself to run up and grab my hair. My son was right there in my sister in laws arms and was previously in my arms. He really could have been hurt and also he was crying watching his grandmother attacking his mom. It breaks my heart to put a case on my husbands mom but she needs to learn a lesson. I do t care to press charges against FIL because he didn\u2019t physically touch me although he was trying to.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve known them since I was 15. I have been with their son 10 years and am the mother of their grandson. they have manipulated me for years and now that I don\u2019t accept it and speak up as an adult, they have become jealous and have crossed boundaries.", "NTA, I feel like he should support you for the sake if your child. Filing charges will ensure that she would not be able to see your child unsupervised in future.", "NTA. She assaulted you, why is your fianc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cbroken heart\u201d a more important factor than your physical safety?", "Definitely NTA press charges. She hurt you and could have hurt your baby. Even if she didn\u2019t attack the baby directly she\u2019s lucky her attack on you didn\u2019t cause you to drop the baby. Please never let your child around this woman she has proven she\u2019s dangerous and unsafe. If you don\u2019t press charges now she will think you\u2019re a doormat and will likely hurt you again in the future.", "NTA she attacked you!!!! that's NEVER ok the fact she is 50 just makes this worse.", "Rephrase your story\u2026 seems it\u2019s ur fianc\u00e9 that pulled ur hair the way it\u2019s written.\n\nAnyways, you can press charges or prevent her from behind around you. But that could cause other issues with fiance", "NTA Press charges. You need this documented, in case someday she starts doing it to your daughter. You also need to write in the report, that your fiance didn't want this reported. You will need that too", "NTA - you should absolutely press charges\u2026 then cut her out of your life\u2026", "NTA \n\nAnd get a restraining order as well.", "NTA. Definitely press charges. See if you can get fil charged to, for threatening you. He acted crazy and violent--don't let him off the hook. He meant to hurt you. It's ASSAULT--legally \"assault\" means threat of bodily harm, the person doesn't have to actually touch you physically (that's \"battery\").  \nIf you let this go, you'll be at their mercy anytime they want to attack you (both mil and fil).  \nIf your fiance can't handle it, you may have to distance yourself from him, too. Time will tell. JUST PROTECT YOURSELF AND YOUR CHILD, please!!", "Ooph. NTA.\n\nObviously its not ok that your MIL stratched you and pulled you by the hair. Especially as there was a risk that baby might be hurt, dropped or traumatised.\n\nObviously you shouldn't expose baby to that person.\n\nBut your fiance's feelings do factor in here. Not because you aren't right to press charges. But I am guessing that his relationship with MIL is complicated, that he may have his own experiences of trauma related to the relationship mixed with good experiences. That the thoughts and feelings that can evovle around this are difficult and deep seated. What you don't want to do is deeply damage the relationship you have with your husband by tapping into something that is complicated for him and that he may not have fully dealt with. \n\nYou absolutely must set a boundary that establishes safety for yourself and baby. But you need to carefully weigh your need for justice against your husbands emotional needs in relation to dealing with a potentially deeply difficult history with his Mum. I think the outcome for your relationship if you choose justice is unpredictable and may not ulimately be worth it.", "I wouldn't press charges for the sake of the relationship. Also the baby is not remembering that.\n\nIt's more about your relationship with your fiance, more than anything else.\n\nAnd discuss this OP with them.\n\n\\*I get it's NTA/YTA......but not everything is this or that. And I think this is a situation where that's especially true. I'm not saying she's right, just I don't think it's simple.\n\nAlso the comment section is always going to tell you to do the most obvious thing. Switch the roles OP and then what would you want your fiance to do or not to do? What if your mother assaulted him? And I say that as a thought-processing mechanic, not to \"guilt\" you into your decision. Though I don't see this positively effecting your relationship with your fiance, since he clearly cares about seeing his mother not having charges pressed against her. It's not a \"too bad\" situation. If it was, the answer would be simply what everyone else is saying. \n\n*Also my other reply in this thread is sarcastic, if you see that.*", "ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
