I also decided to cook her her favorite dinner while I was there.\n\nAfter I had made the chicken marsala, mashed potatoes, and garlic bread, I invited her to come to the dining room and serve herself a plate. She was in the middle of watching a movie, so she told me to just serve it for her.\n\nWhen I gave her her plate, she got really upset and asked me why the hell I served her less food than I did for myself. (We both got two equal pieces of chicken breast and garlic bread, I just served myself a few more spoons of mashed potatoes because I had a big appetite.) I asked her if she would like me to go get her more mashed potatoes.\n\nShe yelled at me and said I was missing the point, and threw out her plate of food and called me a jackass. Afterwards, she started crying and told me to leave.\n\nI\u2019ve tried contacting her but she hasn\u2019t responded since then. I feel really bad for hurting her feelings but I don\u2019t know why me serving her a little less food got her so upset, because it was an easily fixable problem. AITA?\n\n\n\nEXTRA CONTEXT- A lot of commenters have asked about these things so: \n\nI gave her around a cup of mashed potatoes, and a 5/4 a cup to myself. All the other foods were equally given.\n\nThis sort of situation has never happened before, because we have only been dating for two months, and this is the first time I\u2019ve cooked and served her a meal.\n\nSo far, she has never mentioned any history of body image issues, eating disorders, growing up in poverty, etc.", "created_utc": 1687520274, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14gw9ve/aita_for_serving_my_girlfriend_a_smaller_portion/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dear god, step away from this mess! In this little snapshot of your dinner, she\u2019s showing that she\u2019s unappreciative, volatile (what the hell kind of reaction was that?!), a bad communicator (throwing a plate of food is toddler-like behavior), and entitled (\u201cserve me my food while I sit on my ass!\u201d)\n\nYeah, no, you\u2019re NTA but she is in a major way. Move on.", "She threw out a plate a food?? Yikes! Well.... that\u2019s not good. Even if you were 100% wrong.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it like an adult there\u2019s not a lot you can do. The simplest answer is .... don\u2019t serve her food anymore.\n\nPersonally, this type of nonsense would be the end of this relationship for me.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You didnt do ANYTHING wrong. You did not \"hurt her feelings\". You served her her favorite dish. This is a gigantic red flag if I've ever heard of one. You even offered to get her more, that whole drama could be over in 15 seconds. She threw away the food and insulted you? Get out dude. Truely, get out. Just be happy she showed you her real side so early in. This is just screams emotional abuse incoming.", "So you went to the trouble of cooking her favorite meal, served her, brought it to her. She threw a tantrum because of 2 or 3 spoons of mashed potatoes, threw her plate and threw you out? It's a very disturbing behaviour on her part. You are only 2 month in that relationship, do you really want someone who treat you like that? NTA", "NTA.  She over-reacted - did she think you were implying she is overweight? Anytime I fix a plate for another person, I limit the portions to avoid wasting food - if they are still hungry, they are welcome to seconds.", "NTA, you cant mindread and if she did not communicate her issues with food its kinda shitty thing to do to you. Give her space and find someone more compatible and less toxic (this silent treatment is soo immature)", "NTA. Sounds like way more was going on with her than just the serving size of mashed potatoes. Without knowing more/her/you, I won\u2019t speculate, but her response was not proportionate or appreciative.", "NTA, it doesn't seem like you served her a small child-sized portion. You just gave yourself a bit more because you were hungry. All she had to do is ask for some more as well, not freak out over it.", "NTA. \n\nPeople are twisting themselves into knots trying to find a reason that your GF isn't the AH. I don't get it. She is a massive AH and she treated you very badly. Calling this an \"overreaction\" is two steps beyond an understatement. The responses where people are wondering aloud if she came from an impoverished background, was abused as a child, or has body dysmorphia are BS. They are searching for a reason to absolve her of responsibility and help explain away her awful behavior.\n\nIf your girlfriend of two months had cooked you your favorite meal and you insisted on being served because you were watching a movie EVERYONE would call you an AH for that alone. There would be exactly 0 NAH judgements and there wouldn't be a single \"Info.\" If you threw out the dinner that she made you not a single person would empathize with you. No one would try to better understand your response. If you then kicked your girlfriend out of the house while yelling and crying everyone would recognize how absolutely bat shit crazy you are. The fact this whole thing was about something as trivial as the serving size of mashed potatoes wouldn't be overlooked.\n\nRun away. She is unstable. She is unhinged. Two months in and she has already let the mask slip. Abuse lies ahead. Don't mess with her.", "She maybe assumed that you thought she should eat less. You probably didn't mean it that way but maybe she has insecurities. I think she definitely over reacted and you did a very nice thing for her. She could have a good reason to feel upset and maybe with time, she can open up and hopefully apologise too. NTA", "NTA - girls got some issues she needs to work thru.", "Did she not think of just asking for more mashed potatoes instead of having a hissy fit over it?  NTA", "Nta your girlfriend is. this is red flag if the gender reveal people will tell you to run away while you can.", "I think you are NTA because given that you guys have been dating for just 2 months it's obvious that both of you have alot to learn about each other. You gave her a certain amount of food because you didn't know how much she would want to eat and you gave yourself a little more because you knew you wanted more of it, so I don't think you were at fault. What if you had given her more and she would have ended up eating less? I think it's better to serve less instead of wasting the food because later she did have a choice to get some more if she wanted to.\n\nBut if she made it a big deal maybe something terrible might have happened that she got reminded of when you did this or maybe she had some insecurities related to this. In my opinion, when you do get in touch with her you should talk about this and ask her why she reacted the way she did on an easily fixable issue. In short I would say you are NTA because you did a pretty normal thing and your intentions weren't bad.", "NTA. You took some extra potatoes when you were dishing it out; it's not like you didn't give her a good portion. Everything about her behavior here is strange. If I had a new boyfriend come over and cook my favorite meal, I'd be thrilled and I wouldn't need to be called to the table; I wouldn't curse him out if he took a little extra food; I wouldn't yell and throw out the food and kick him out over a portion of potatoes. I guess you can consider yourself lucky that she did this after only two months so you can get out without having wasted too much time.", "OMG NTA but she sounds very very unstable. Throwing a plate of food because you got served a slightly smaller amount of potatoes is not normal behavior. Only two months in and she's behaving like a deranged anger monster? It will only get worse from here, friend. Maybe best to get out now before she starts throwing things AT you.", "NTA. Don't invest no more time or energy into the relationship. She's showing you how she deals with conflict. She's showing you how she'll turn anything into a conflict. Believe her! End things. Then run!", "NTA. Do you really need such person in your life? And believe me, this is just the beginning of your trouble. I would run fast", "Nta. This is an over-reaction and a red flag, a sign of immature tantrums to come. Find another girlfriend one who can appreciate the effort, and get a spoon of extra mash without acting like a toddler.", "NTA but has this happened before? seems strange she would be suddenly upset over this", "NTA.  Maybe someone else said something to her about her size/weight recently and it's been bothering her.  And when you gave her a smaller plate of food she saw it as you silently agreeing and she lashed out.\n\nShe shouldn't have but a delayed reaction is very common in some people.", "NTA. You had more potatoes because you were super hungry. No need for her to get so upset about it", "Stay away from the crazy my dude. Plenty of amazing women out there who would love a cooked dinner. Not your job to fix this mess I'd just break up and go no contact no explanation or excuse justifies or makes this better.", "Run don't go back NTA", "NTA\n\nYou made her dinner and she threw it because you didn't serve her extra mash...how old is she 2? Honestly you may better off out of it\n\nYou are not an AH\n\n**Not biologically** \\- Males have a larger NEST daily calorie requirement so need slightly more food\n\n**Not Logically** you say you have a \"big appetite\" so you gave yourself some extra mash....not the good bits just some extra spuds. If you know you eat more than she does why  you think she would want extra potatoes on her plate to just be thrown away. You had no way of knowing how hungry she was compared to you.\n\n**Not in practice** There were more potatoes available she could go back for seconds if she wanted.", "GF is an automatic AH for wasting food. NTA OP think about putting gf in the trash with the chicken marsala", "NTA\n\nThis woman doesn't need a boyfriend. She needs a therapist. \n\nYou need a new GF. \n\nRun. Run as fast as you can. Do not reengage. Do not look back.", "Nta. She is showing you a giant red flag. Please think about if you want to continue in a relationship with her.\n\nYour assumption of you needing more food was reasonable. However let's assume that she had a completely valid reason for being upset that you gave yourself more. Her behavior is still completely out of line. A rational person would have told she is upset and why. Not thrown away food that you made, crying and throwing you out of the apartment. That is not how a rational adult reacts to getting a bit less mashed potatoes.", "She threw a tantrum plus didn\u2019t eat any to punish you. Worse was throwing it out. It was uncalled for. You didn\u2019t pile up your plate like trying to get 2 servings. I do think it\u2019s best to dip out a serving as close as possible. And after all has had a plate, going back for seconds is fine. Some people you should ask if it\u2019s okay, or would others like what\u2019s left and once told no, say you will. A mannerly thing that most say no, you have it. NTA. A few more spoons of mashed potatoes isn\u2019t that much. Plus sounds like there was more mashed potatoes that after she gobbled on her plate all, could get up and get more. I usually hand someone a plate and say there is more on the stove.  Somehow I think your gf would have gotten mad no matter what.", "NTA. That's some Extra.", "NTA! Spare yourself this madness. There's a healthy way and an unhealthy way to communicate needs. Your GF chose the latter. Get away from this toxicity and find another fishy in the sea", "NTA . She has issues of her own that are not your fault. Get out while you can!", "I think you\u2019ve dodged a bullet to be honest.", "Just walk away. It's 2 months and yiu don't need the drama", "NTA. Been there. Bro, RUN. I don't like to generalize but i just got flashbacks to almost the same scenario. It just gets worse, emotional manipulation, picking fights. \n\nIf you want, give her a chance to explain herself but you HAVE to make it clear that you're not going to put up with guessing and trying to figure out what's wrong if she's not going to communicate and that her reaction wasn't fair or right. If she does it again, just end it. She doesn't get to make you feel bad because she feels bad and doesn't know how to express it, that's not her right and trauma isn't an excuse.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong here. If there are issues you are not aware of, she needs to tell you now.", "NTA. Run, OP, run fast. I have a sneaking suspicion it will only get worse.", "NTA, your girlfriend's reaction was excessive to say the least.  Maybe there's an underlying reason for this, I don't know but you need to get to the bottom of this if you want your relationship to go anywhere", "NTA. Find someone who isn't like this.", "Next it'll be because you didn't celebrate her unbirthday. This woman sounds like she has issues. If it's worth working on the  stick around, otherwise, leg it in the opposite direction.", "Info: she threw out her plate means\u2026?\n\nI bet there are some insecurities from her, and she thought you wanna make sure she stays thin or doesn\u2019t eat too much or whatever.", "This is either N T A or N A H depending on the actual amount of food given\u2026hard to say without knowing (or without knowing if she has weight insecurities, or something like that).", "If you went to a restaurant and ordered identical meals, the portions would be the same.\n\nCutting to the point, I would bet money that in HER mind, you implied she was overweight. \n\nI don't believe you would have done this consciously. Perhaps you subconsciously noticed that the women in your family ate smaller portions, idk. \n\nShe assumed your explanation was a lie, so she let her feelings get in the way. She disrespected you. It takes effort to make a nice meal. She tossed it aside, along with your explanation. She's TA and emotionally immature.", "Does your gf come from a family that is poor or abusive?  Or did she live in poverty at any point?\n\nThat kind of overreaction often has trauma behind it.  Not always, but often.  I\u2019ve seen people give reactions like that when they have had someone in their past be very controlling over their food intake or they suffered from food insecurity at a vulnerable age.  It can be a trauma trigger for some folks.  It\u2019s not an excuse for the behavior, but it is an explanation.\n\nNTA.  I think it\u2019d be wise to talk in a couple days, when she\u2019s had a chance to cool down so she can try to talk about it more calmly instead of being all in her feelings.  Just make sure it\u2019s as far from meal times as possible, as that\u2019s likely to increase whatever tension she has around food.", "That would be a dealbreaker for me.  When someone shows you who they are, believe them.  Red flag!", "NAH, leaning towards nta. It seems pretty obvious she has some glaring insecurity issues and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this has happened in the past. However, you took the time to make and *serve* her food when she wouldn\u2019t get up to get it herself. \n\nIt just seems very childish to complain about the amount when you could\u2019ve went to get it yourself, but someone else kindly brought it to you instead. I\u2019d approach this gently with her when she finally does reach out and explain that you didn\u2019t understand why it upset her, but you\u2019d like to better understand it if she\u2019s willing to talk about it.", "INFO: Has she reacted like this before? This feels like strange behavior to happen out of the blue", "This screams ED brain. Nta. be kind when you try and communicate with her About this.", "Normally there is a preconceived notion that girls eat less than guys. And there are girls who does that. But there are also a lot of girls who has a big appetite and loves to eat more. \n\nSo when you give a girl like that, who lives to eat more, less portion of food than you would serve yourself, unknowingly you are feeding to the narrative girls needs/eats less. It hurts the said girls. \n\nCause if they ask for equal or more, they would be judged on that. Providing less quantities can also mean you are asking them to eat less, again indicating they should lose weight or indirectly saying they are eating too much. \n\nIn this case though, I need more info to understand. \n\nInfo: Does your gf normally eat same quantity of food as you do? Does she eat more? Is she on the heavier side? Does she have insecurities regarding food consumption?\n\nThese would be the deciding factors. \n\nNot that yelling at someone is right approach.

Was that a significant relationship milestone for y\u2019all?", "I had to scroll back up to check your ages after reading this.  5 week anniversary? From this and your description she sounds immature and frankly unbalanced. As the saying goes, when people tell you who they are, listen.", "I didn\u2019t vote. Just making you aware.", "...are you okay? Everything going well in your life? Because that's a lot of hostility to bring to a random stranger promoting kindness.", "So first off, I agree with you. This is one of the problems of the AITA format. A bunch of that stuff you mentioned wasn't in the original post. I do not like how the original posts can be edited and then commenters look unreasonable for taking a reasonable position with the information originally given.", "Why not just fill the plates equally and then save what\u2019s left over?", "Man, you get worked up easily. I've never had an issue finishing off portions from my gfs plate. Yeah, they could've easily gotten seconds.", "Her reasoning was that five is her favorite number. I did know it was her favorite number but didn\u2019t realize she expected me to plan something for the five week anniversary.\n\nHer birthday was a few days after that and I had planned a nice surprise for that, so she eventually forgot about the five week fiasco.", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m sorry, but you are dodging a major bullet here. She sounds like she can\u2019t communicate at ALL, and then reacts like a child. Do yourself a major favor and just walk away from this mess.", "Who the hell celebrates 5 weeks anniversary??? I would understand 1 month (if you both were teenagers) or half a year. But 5 weeks? What is that?\n\nAlso a question, if it was such a big deal for her, did she organize something for you? Some dinner or present? Or it was totally on you?\n\nOP seriously it's a situation \"run, Forest, run!\". This two episodes are all covered with red flags. She is going to be hysterical and bossy, I can promise you that. No normal girl of 26 would do that. She is now checking the boundaries but it will get worse, believe me.\n\n NTA but she is.", "Communication is important in any relationship because neither of you is a mind reader. It\u2019s also something that develops over time. She sounds like someone who knows what she wants. You sound like someone who\u2019s caring & considerate. These are great traits to have. If y\u2019all communicate your needs and desires clearly, effectively & with compassion, you could have a successful relationship.", "Understood. Well I know to always listen to a person who calls themselves \"Pimpdaddy69\" when they talk about women.", "Couldn't agree with you more. She sounds awful. 5 week anniversary isn't a thing even if it's her favourite number. Then throwing a plate of food away and yelling at you because she had slightly less mashed potatoes than you, even when you offered her more! \n\nIt doesn't matter if there's a good reason behind it such as previous poverty or body image issues. You don't deserve to be treated like that, and you don't have to be. Chalk this one up to experience and move on away from her.", "This is the worst advice possible. \n\nShe doesn't sound like someone who knows what she wants, unless you mean that she wants chaos and conflict. She sounds like a toxic person with a personality disorder.\n\nShe had a Chernobyl level melt down over the serving size of a side dish. When she wants to heap abuse on her boyfriend she manufactures a reason. She blew up on him for not celebrating a 5 week anniversary. Why should he have ever conceived of such a thing? Oh, because her favorite number is five. Cool, my favorite number is go f#ck yourself.\n\nWhat do you mean when you say that a caring and considerate person should try to use communication and compassion to stop their abusive volatile irrational SO from treating them poorly? What kind of advice is that? He should understand that the abuse is coming from a place of loving insecurity? \n \n\n>She sounds like someone who knows what she wants...These are great traits to have...\n\nHead officially explodes", "You sound stable af \ud83e\udd23"]}
