Which it appears they've failed miserably at.\n\nGet out when you can.  Save your money, open a bank account they cannot touch and get out of that abusive house at the first possible moment.\n\nGood luck in your chosen career path!", "NTA...You don't owe your parents anything for raising you. It doesn't appear they did a stellar job anyway, even though you appear to have a good head on your shoulders.  Plan your own future, and do what you have to do to achieve the goals you have.  Your parents will have to figure their own future out. Stay strong!", "Where on Earth does a nurse earn more than a software engineer?", "NTA- Let them say what they want. Go away to college and never return. Are your parents paying for college? Are they making you stay and pay rent while in college? \n\nYou don\u2019t have to do anything for your parents when you have your own job. You might have to make your life more difficult, but it\u2019s better than being under their thumb.", "NTA. Go to college and never look back! Emancipation is an option but it will be hard to go to high school still and maintain enough work hours to pay for an apartment and utilities. I would save as much as you can and then get out and become the person you want to be. Your parents have a lot of nerve but if I was you I\u2019d play it cool till you go to college. Then go NC with them. They don\u2019t deserve your time or your money.", "They can't lawfully take a minor child's money. The day you turn 18, they can charge you whatever rent/bills they want.\n\nMove out as soon as you turn 18. In the meantime, don't argue with them about it. Just stay as silent as possible and make a plan to go.\n\nAfter you move out, try to maintain a relationship with your brothers, even if it's behind your parents' backs. You'll all probably want that relationship when you're grown, don't let your parents destroy it.\n\nPursue the career path that you want. Pursue the life that you want. Your parents can fend for themselves.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nOpen an account they cannot access and have all your money go there. \n\nIt\u2019s parents\u2019 responsibility to provide for their children. Children don\u2019t owe their parents. That\u2019s such a gross idea. \n\nYour brothers may need help, but you\u2019ll be in a better position once you\u2019re in a stable and independent situation.", "NTA ur parents are entitled as shit and need a wake up call to realise you owe them nothing. So what they raised you? they chose to have a kid that\u2019s like the whole point of having children raising them it\u2019s the bare minimum.", "NTA - but I'm exceedingly curious what job you're doing at 17, in school, and living at home that earns enough for a mortgage and bills. Child film star?  Crypto currency genius?\n\nThis is not popular, but being asked to contribute to the household you live in (be that by babysitting or finances) isn't unreasonable.  Contribute - not cover.", "NTA\n\nLeave when you can. (Are there any friends' families that might take you in for the time being?)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They still insist I pay the bills and the mortgage of the house because I don't and can't live here for free, even though I'm only 17 so I technically have NO choice but to live here.\n\nYou could see what you could do to emancipate yourself. But if you don't do that and they don't provide for you - a minor - call child protective services.", "NTA If you are in the US, you can request emancipation and be on your own. \n\nPaying rent when you hit a certain age is fair, it teaches kids about bills. When my kids got jobs, I had them pay 10% of their net pay or take home pay, unless they were also in school, so summer months and after graduation. This usually amounted to a very small amount like 17.00 every two weeks. I would then take the money and put it away and use it to buy something they said they wanted; new shoes, sweater, etc. \n\nBut I would never expect them to pay my mortgage. Even if they began to see you as a roommate and not a child, that would mean you were only responsible for a portion of it, not all of it. \n\nYour parents are treating you as a slave, not a child.", "NTA. What on earth? No way op, this is abuse. Tour parents are supposed to support you, indeed are legally obliged to support you. This is not a loan, and does not create any financial obligation on you. And you've been a punchbag (abuse) and a babysitter (parentification) so they have destroyed even the usual hope that you will love them. You owe them nothing OP, nothing. Get out, get away. And be free.", "NTA.\n\nAt 17, your parents are legally responsible for providing you with food and shelter. You, OTOG, have no legal obligation to provide them with anything. A small room and board would be reasonable, paying their bills and mortgage is not.", "NTA.\n\nWhen someone chooses to have a child, they accept responsibility for caring for and paying for that child until he/she is an adult.  The responsibility is a DIRECT consequence of their decision.  You did not choose to be conceived or birthed; you are not required to pay for their decisions.  \n\nUntil you are legally an adult. they CANNOT make you pay the mortgage or the basic utilities.  You can report them to your local child protective services agency if they try to take your earnings and use them for the bills, though if you are close to 18 and getting out, it might not be worth it.  But the day you are 18, you can open your own bank account, without their involvement, and have your pay directly deposited to that account.\n\nRight now, I would focus on having a plan in place to get out as soon as possible.  If you have a place to move or store your stuff they can't access, I would probably start slowly and quietly moving as much of your critical stuff out as possible, so that if things go badly, they can't prevent you from taking your own things with you.", "NTA.  They\u2019re being manipulative and awful.  Also- They chose to have a kid and the responsibilities of raising that kid fall on them.  The whole \u201c you owe us\u201d thing from parents is insane IMO.", "NTA - take it from a mum of 3, you don't owe them your money. Respect if they respected you, sure. That's about it. Start planning your escape the day you graduate high school (birth certificate, opening new bank account and closing the old ones...). If you could find a trusting adult around you to live with it would be great too.\n\nGood luck! Anyways they won't be able to keep you stuck your entire life. So go and enjoy your freedom when the time comes.", "As a father to three kids, I could never imagine them paying my bills or requesting they pay rent for living with me.\n\nNTA", "OP here. I've seen that you guys have suggested getting CPS involved, I wish I could but the last time CPS had gotten involved with my family was when my brother's teacher suspected abuse going on in the house because he would always cry that my parents would beat him if he acted out of line. My dad threw a fit and yelled at the teacher for getting CPS on him and even thinking that he would hit his child.\n\nI'll say it honestly here, he has beaten my brother physically from time to time, and I'd overhear him telling my brother to stop crying like a, and I quote, \"stupid little girl.\" Keep in mind he is only 11 years old. \n\nBut CPS just ignored the case and went about their day, so it's no use.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
