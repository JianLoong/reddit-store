Most likely he can have them arrested for being there.", "Is there a way to place a camera that gives a view of the door without him knowing? Make sure it is one you can access from anywhere on your phone. If he does slip them a key, you'll be able to see them. What you do after that depends on how you think your landlord would react. Personally, assuming I could handle rent on my own, I'd call the cops and tell them there are trespassers in the apartment. Landlord may only evict him if you show you are not complicit.", "I don't want to get the police involved or do anything that extreme", "I don't think there is a place\nBut I will probably shut the water off and put a lock on it.\nIf they do happen to come by they wouldn't have water and they probably have to leave\nAlso I don't want to let the landlord know because it could end badly for me", "Definitely don't put yourself at risk.
