As a kid, I worked in factories and machine shops, and there was almost always at least one man with a missing finger.

Only removing it when it's inappropriate means you will eventually forget, or you'll lose it.\n\nYou didn't approach your friend because you had valid concerns.

The second reason is because you assume your way of viewing the world and doing things is the only correct way, and if someone else doesn't conform to that you judge them.\n\nMany other commenters have said that many medical professionals don't wear wedding rings. There are other professions where wearing a wedding ring is either a safety hazard or a hygiene issue. There are even issues with things like cleaning products stripping rodium plating off white gold etc and people take those things into account too. I take all my white gold rings off if I'm scrubbing  the bathroom or kitchen so I don't have to redo the rhodium plating as often. This is super common.\n\nThere are also medical reasons for people not wearing rings or jewellery. I'm an example of this. I have complex trauma and despite two decades of treatment, my autonomic nervous system still gets overwhelmed multiple times a day due to flashbacks or loud noises or whatever else. If I get sensory overwhelm going on, all my clothing etc. starts to feel constricting. I wear lose stretchy clothing at all times to counter this. When I'm super overwhelmed I take off all jewellery, even earrings. Necklaces are the worst for me but rings aren't good either. Everything touching my body feels like it's a weight or a restriction during those times.\n\nDuring really bad times I'll go weeks without wearing any jewellery, including my wedding ring. My husband couldn't give two hoots. If you need a ring on your finger to prove that a marriage is valid and that nobody's up to something nefarious, that says something about your trust issues.  \n\nMy husband has autism. He wasn't sure whether he'd be okay with wearing a ring sensory wise either. He tried it, liked it after a couple of weeks and now is only without it if he's in his workshop or working on one of the cars. Everyone's different mate but you'd better believe there are hundreds of situations andvmedical reasons for not wearing a ring.

Rings don\u2019t make a marriage work.\n\nThe most amazing marriage I know of is my parents\u2019 - they are clearly still enamored with each other as well as deep connection, more than 50 years in. I have never seen a wedding ring on either of their fingers. \n\nIt used to bug an ex of mine that they didn\u2019t wear rings, didn\u2019t make it clear to others that they are taken. I wear mine off and on, my wife doesn\u2019t wear hers. \n\nOP, it\u2019s none of your business and YTA.", "Even before COVID my rings would yellow so much more quickly because of how often I would gel in/out of a patient room, and working in clinical trials I only saw 3-4 patients a day!
