As a kid, I worked in factories and machine shops, and there was almost always at least one man with a missing finger.

Only removing it when it's inappropriate means you will eventually forget, or you'll lose it.\n\nYou didn't approach your friend because you had valid concerns.

The second reason is because you assume your way of viewing the world and doing things is the only correct way, and if someone else doesn't conform to that you judge them.\n\nMany other commenters have said that many medical professionals don't wear wedding rings. There are other professions where wearing a wedding ring is either a safety hazard or a hygiene issue. There are even issues with things like cleaning products stripping rodium plating off white gold etc and people take those things into account too. I take all my white gold rings off if I'm scrubbing  the bathroom or kitchen so I don't have to redo the rhodium plating as often. This is super common.\n\nThere are also medical reasons for people not wearing rings or jewellery. I'm an example of this. I have complex trauma and despite two decades of treatment, my autonomic nervous system still gets overwhelmed multiple times a day due to flashbacks or loud noises or whatever else. If I get sensory overwhelm going on, all my clothing etc. starts to feel constricting. I wear lose stretchy clothing at all times to counter this. When I'm super overwhelmed I take off all jewellery, even earrings. Necklaces are the worst for me but rings aren't good either. Everything touching my body feels like it's a weight or a restriction during those times.\n\nDuring really bad times I'll go weeks without wearing any jewellery, including my wedding ring. My husband couldn't give two hoots. If you need a ring on your finger to prove that a marriage is valid and that nobody's up to something nefarious, that says something about your trust issues.  \n\nMy husband has autism. He wasn't sure whether he'd be okay with wearing a ring sensory wise either. He tried it, liked it after a couple of weeks and now is only without it if he's in his workshop or working on one of the cars. Everyone's different mate but you'd better believe there are hundreds of situations andvmedical reasons for not wearing a ring.

Which could be read as romantic to my mom, but was really just fucking stupid.", "seconding this! Or she may be out at work and not want to get into her relationship status with patients!\n\nThere are so many reasons she may not be wearing a ring, and they are all nobody else\u2019s business", "Oh... yeah, I'm not even sure why OP was *there* then.", "Yeah, I'm a veterinarian and while technically we don't have a policy regarding jewelry where I work, it's obviously a no-go for scrubbing into surgery and for certain other tasks. Even if I wanted to wear it during some \"safer\" parts of the day, the risk of losing it would be too high for me to want to wear it to work.\n\nI have a silicone ring for work and I've lost *that* a couple times because I still have to take it off for surgery and things. No way I would risk my real wedding band.", "Absolutely.", "My husband is a physician and never wears his wedding ring at work because he has to take it off for every procedure. He used to wear it to work and within a few month lost it because it fell out of his scrubs pocket. So it makes way more sense for him to just leave it at home.\n\nI also personally don\u2019t wear mine most of the time because my fingers swell when it\u2019s hot or I forget.\n\nPeople get so weird about wedding rings when it\u2019s just a symbol. I know I\u2019m married and that\u2019s all that matters. If someone asks I\u2019ll just tell them", "PCA here and I haven't worn my rings in god knows how long. I really, *really* don't want them tearing holes in my gloves for obvious reasons.", "I haven't worn a wedding ring in over a decade.  My husband usually does, my official wedding ring doesn't fit me anymore and I can't wear jewelry for my workouts so I just don't wear one.  I would lose it for sure if I had to take it on and off multiple times a week.", "I worked with addicts and didn't use mine because of the risk of someone stealing it. And when the children were young it just didn't make sense to wear them. My husband isn't allowed to wear his to work. Still managed to have a healthy marriage for 20 years and counting.", "Honestly, my partner and I aren't married but he's bought me some jewelry including rings over the years and I don't wear that to work, as an engineer.. the thought of dislocating my finger (or worse) doesn't sound like fun to me \ud83e\udd23", "Wait\u2026 what? He \u201cdoesn\u2019t like to type with it?\u201d", "My engagement ring is \u201csmall\u201d. Partially because it was my grandmothers diamond, and partially because I didn\u2019t want a big ring as a nurse.  I do wear it to work now because I have an office job with no real \u201cpatient\u201d care. But when I was in a nursing home I only wore my band which doesn\u2019t have any stones to it.", "Don't google degloving!!", "My husband works construction, this is exactly why he never wears his to work. Too much of a hazard to get caught on machines he uses.", "Ouch!  I don't wear a ring *ever* at my job (I'm an industrial mechanic) for this exact reason.  Seen enough pictures of that and know one person who it happened to (lost his finger) to never want to risk it.", "My Dad worked in a factory and never wore his ring to work for that very reason.\n\nI would imagine a cardiologist in a hospital might have to use a defibrillator on occasion and a metal ring would be a bad idea.", "Just to dig up some hot scoop on her friend\u2019s marriage I guess !", "To check on Avery's ring situation, obviously!", "OP knows the doctor, that makes her important.", "I never even thought that this would be a thing anyone would notice about another person.", "The best marriage I've ever had the privilege of seeing was my grandparent's. \n\nMy grandfather didn't wear a ring after the 2nd one he melted off his finger.  (Mechanic who arc-ed it across a battery). My grandma wire their hers 3 times and always said she did dishes with them on just so she'd be free. \n\nRings don't make marriages work. Which is a relief", "I'm a massage therapist so I can't wear mine. Sometimes I'll go a week before I remember to put it back on.", "My husband and I didn\u2019t even bother getting wedding bands because we both hate wearing rings lol.", "Degloving is a minor phobia my father accidentally caused when I asked why he didn't wear his wedding ring to work.  Now I only wear my wedding to work, white collar government job.  Yard work, motorcycle riding, anything else, I am ring free.", "\ud83d\ude02 yeah he says it clicks on the key board \ud83e\udd37", "Sadly I don't need to. My dad's ring saved his hand from a vise that collapsed on it, though.", "googled it, thats wild. new injury i didnt know about", "I've met too many old construction workers and tradesmen missing just the ring finger.", "I\u2019ve actually been sitting here since I posted my comment trying to remember the last time I noticed someone wearing a wedding ring. Or have even thought to check. Like it\u2019s so far outside of my realm of concern it\u2019s probably been years. It matters so little to my life.", "Happened to Jimmy Fallon and all he did was slipped in the kitchen. \n\nIf I do wear a ring I wear a silicon ring to prevent that and an accidental arching from welding which hurts like hell.", "woahhhh i wonder if it has to do with tightness of the ring? i wear a ring on each of my middle fingers, but theyre a little bit loose so theyre easy to take off or spin around on my finger"]}
