You don't really have a way of knowing and if you recommend her and she is a poor performer or a difficult coworker, it's going to look bad on you if you recommended her.

So, bad for your company.\n\nPlus, unless you've worked with her, her resume that makes her look like such a great candidate could be all \"puff.\" And, unless she's really changed, she sounds like the type who would bad mouth you to other employees - also not good for your company.\n\nSo, she's reaping what she'd sown AND your company is better off without her.

I get everyone thinks it's deserved, but it's theoretically about 20 years later and you're still holding a grudge against this person? It's petty to be perfectly honest.

It\u2019s a genuine question. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is it might be a good idea to look at the type of treatment this bully gave to the OP to try and decide if it will translate over into the work place. True, some people can change but OP said this person bullied them from middle school until graduation. That\u2019s a long time! Depending on the types of bullying actions that took place, it might be best to pass them over after all. \n\nExample: repetitive and intentional exclusion is a form of bullying.

Did she interview this person?", "At the very least you have to give them a chance right? I've been bullied in high school too, but if that guy showed up now, I wouldn't think much of it. He's basically a complete stranger to me. I'd judge him just like anyone else I don't know. There's a huge difference between a 17 year old or so and a 38 year old. Teenagers are brats half the time. To judge someone who is almost 40 based on their teen years is just strange to me.", "Pretty much what I said", "Yet they also mention the person they chose is great too. It's better for everyone to pick the slightly less \"perfect\" applicant if there's no reason to believe they could cause problems with coworkers l over the \"perfect\" applicant that previously went out of her way to harm others and that no one holds proof of having changed. Who cares how long it's been, there's plenty of shitty adults that still act like bullies well past their 40's.", ">At the very least you have to give them a chance right?\n\nNo you don't. Not when there's another great applicant you don't have any reason to worry about. Plenty of people that bullied people as teens kept the same or similar energy as adults. There are plenty assholes that are over 40. Why take the risk on someone you don't know has grown when you have someone else that's also a great fit that you have no reason to believe may bring a negative attitude to the team? If anything that's not fair to the team the new hire will be working with because if you accept her despite knowing her past and she causes problems they could've been avoided by simply going with the safer option."]}
