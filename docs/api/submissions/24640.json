I let her know that if I\u2019m going to drive 4 hours round trip to an amusement park spending $150+, I\u2019d want to stay for more than a few hours and enjoy myself. \n\nBackstory.. she is obese, doesn\u2019t want to get healthy or lose the weight (which is her choice and I respect her regardless), but every time we do an outdoor activity like the Zoo, Seaworld or Disney she needs to sit down every 5 minutes, wants to eat a giant meal 30 minutes into our time there, and then 2 hours later needs to leave as she\u2019s been on her feet too long. \n\nSo basically I get about an hours worth of fun, it\u2019s a total waste of money and time, as she is incredibly sedentary in her lifestyle and gets winded on short walks, even though she by no means is the largest person I know. She just is extremely lazy and makes a million excuses about why she can\u2019t even do a simple 30 min walk around her condo complex. She joined a gym and 3 days later stopped going because \u201cit\u2019s a waste she could do the same at home and have better results\u201d. Again I support her regardless as IDGAF if someone is 125 lbs or 300, who cares. \n\nWell today she got offended when I suggested we do something that involves sitting vs walking (beach, movies, food, etc.) and kept pushing me on why I was saying that when I was on a sunset hike myself last night\u2026 the difference is I walk daily, watch what I eat, go to the gym and while I\u2019m no where near as fit as I could be, I\u2019m able to be on my feet at Disney for 5-6+ hours (as are most people who go there, even the overweight ones).\n\nSo at this point I\u2019m limiting the types of activities I do with her, especially if they cost money and take a lot of time to get to. She said I\u2019m being cold and not sympathetic enough of her needs. I\u2019m simply saying until you can walk for more than 5 mins at a time let\u2019s do more realistic activities that we can both still enjoy, as if I\u2019m dropping coin on Disney I don\u2019t want to be forced to either leave 2 hours in, or be alone for several more hours (no fun).", "created_utc": 1692032953, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15r0lei/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_disneyland_with_my/", "score": 1881, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's just incompatible. I also live about 3.5 hours away from Disney World and there are plenty of very plus size people there (me included) that are able to keep up with the crowds and be on their feet for the 6+ hours. I would not want to spend all that money driving there, tickets etc just to go on maybe one or two rides before heading home. That's a waste in my opinion.", "Prepare to get roasted but you are NTA. I was obese and it sucks. If this case were about discrimination you wouldn\u2019t suggest other activities. She is just angry with herself for the consequences of her lack of willpower and is projecting that on you.", "NTA - if you\u2019re not going to have fun, you have every right to decline certain activities especially ones like Disney that are expensive, etc.", "\"Not being sympathetic enough to her needs\" was a literal laugh at loud moment. Going to Disney on a day trip is not a need.  NTA.", "NTA - I do agree with you that it's important to consider the value-for-dollar you get when going out. If your company is unable to match with your idea of value-for-dollar then it is not something y'all ought to do together. Your friend is content spending the money only to hang around a couple hours while you are not. Simple as. \n\nI believe you addressed the issue as tactfully as your could without bullshitting anybody and are working thoughtfully to find a nice middle ground between the two of you.", "NTA for not wanting to go, but I would not say all of this to her. This is a situation where you need to hold you ground (and \"No.\" is a full setnence!), but you do need to avoid being hurtful or demeaning.", "NTA\n\nBased on your history of doing activities together, I would take a 4 hour drive and $150 on Disney just to leave in 2 hours.  The best you can do is travel separately and tell her she is free to leave if she's tired.  You're still willing to spend time with her, just not waste money on stuff you'll know she'll tap-out on within 2 hours.  Reasonable reply.", "NTA, OP, your friend lacks the physical tolerance to engage in activities that are not sedentary. Spending time and money to watch her sit is not enjoyable. You are correct redirecting planned activities for the two of you to things you can both participate in.", "NTA - friends should mutually agree on what types of activities they want to do together, and if you don't think you'll get $150+ worth of fun from the trip, you have every right to say \"I don't want to spend $150+\"\n\nINFO: why don't you ask her to pay? Say \"I don't really want to go to Disneyland with you, but if it's super important to you, I'll go if you pay for my ticket\" then at least you can get an hour for fun for a more appropriate cost?", "NTA\n\nDisney is expensive", "NTA, you're paying for a day and not getting it. Hopefully this is the wake up call she needs to get yourself sorted out.", "NTA as you have valid reasons for not wanting to go. I\u2019d maybe come up with a different reason that wouldn\u2019t make her feel humiliated when you tell her you don\u2019t want to go. It wouldn\u2019t make you the AH if you were honest about it, but just for the sake of preserving the friendship", "NTA. Theme parks are a lot of money. They can be a lot of fun, but only if you go with people who make it fun. I know from experience that when you go with the wrong people, it\u2019s pretty miserable. Nothing about going to Disney with this person sounds enjoyable.", "Sigh. NTA because it's a LOT of money and a few hours is indeed a waste unless you are fortunate and have a AP.\n\nYou mention your friend is obese and has a hard time walking. Would she consider using an personal mobility device to help facilitate a longer visit?  When we are at Disney we see lots of people - older, infirm, younger, all ages and sizes, that need and use them. It could be a game changer. Would your friend be willing to rent one as a compromise?", "NTA - Disney is too expensive to just go for a couple hours. Maybe if you brought another friend who could hang out when she decides she\u2019s had enough.", "NTA - it sounds like you're setting reasonable rules about how you're willing to spend your money.  \nFrom what you say, it sounds like you are generally very supportive of her, and value her for who she is. I'm curious about other people with similar limitations and what they would say.  \nFYI - It also might be worth looking into mobility aids if the main reason she needs to leave Disney and similar things after 2 hours is that she can't be on her feet that long. Often there are scooters etc. available.", "NTA and honestly this is a huge societal issue nowadays. Everyone acts like being obese is okay, but in reality it is dangerous for your physical health and weighs down the people around you (sorry, couldn't resist a good pun there)", "NTA. \n\nYour experience with her is that you have two different ideas of what a day of fun is at an amusement park (or similar setting), so she isn't the person to do those things with, period. I don't love roller coasters, I'm not the person to bring IF you want someone to ride all the rides. If you want someone who will happily hold your stuff, do the other rides, all the games, and eat corndogs, I'm your girl!\n\nYou are spending a lot of money to not have fun, so you shouldn't do it. And it sounds like you are sympathetic- and understanding- of her own choices and her body, and are happy to do things that you both enjoy together. Most people don't do everything with one friend- one friend is in to the same sports, one you go out drinking with, one is your vacation friend- and sure, most friends fit multiple interests, but you don't have to do everything she wants in order to be a good friend.", "Tell her only if she rents an electric scooter so you can stay all day.", "NTA\n\nBut it isn't because she's obese, it's because she's not active. I'm obese according to the BMI and perfectly capable of doing opening to closing at a theme park.", "NTA. I've known people like this and they suck the joy out of everyone around them", "NTA. You don't need any excuse to not want to take a particular friend to an activity. For instance, you wouldn't take want to me (if we were friends) because I dislike roller coasters and similar rides, so you'd either be on them alone or skipping them, neither of which is fair to you.", "NTA\n\nDisneyland/Disney World has electric carts for rent. She could rent one to ride around in. But... she wouldn't be able to drive into where people wait in line. Those lines get pretty damn long and there aren't many places to sit. Some of the rides also have weight limits.  A couple that I know who went to Disney for their honeymoon had a hell of a time. Because the wife was too large for some of the rides.", "NTA - You are allowed to not go to a place with someone for any reason. This time you have a great reason. Disney is a huge park so if she doesn't qualify for the mobility assistance then you have to be willing and able to spend a long day on your feet. She isn't willing to do that so idk why she thinks she is entitled to waste your time and money. You were even wanting to hang out and do a different activity that is more suited to her abilities! There is nothing stopping her from going to disney alone if she wants to go so badly.", "NTA maybe this could be a wake up call for her?", "NTA", "NTA, I think 'being able to do the activity' is a reasonable request for a day trip together. A lot of Disney is standing and walking.   \n\n\nHowever, a lot of your explanation focusses on her weight and habits, coming off as criticism despite you also saying you support them/don't care. If you told her any of what you wrote here no wonder she's upset. Weight is a very tricky subject, especially for a female, so that is always going to be a minefield of a conversation.  I think you should clearly state what you expect if you do go out, e.g. at least 6 hours of the park and you don't want to be left to do your own thing. It may be that she really enjoys those two hours she spends there with you, and doesn't realize you either go home annoyed or spend the next four hours at the park bored. There may also be compromises that would work; like set breaks for lunch/snacks, staggering sitting/longer rides with quicker ones or if you brought a larger group of friends she could take breaks and you could still go on rides with other friends.", "NTA\n\nYou've tried outings with her before, and it hasn't been fun. That's a lot of money to drop on something you likely will barely enjoy. She's also pushing you specifically to do more physical activities when trying to pivot is the polite thing to do\n\nBased on your comments, she's kinda pushing you to give more specifics, so that's not going to end well.\n\nIn the future, since she's going to be argumentative, don't give excuses. Just say no or I'm not interested. The pushy aspect is really what's making this not great", "NTA. Blame the Fat Acceptance movement for this. As always, it started as a reasonable movement: my weight is none of your business, and I don't need to look a certain way because fat people offend your sensibilities. But nowadays it's more: include me in anything, and if you don't, you're a fAtpHoBIc monster. No. If she can't reasonably keep up, Disneyland is not for her. That's sad, but it is what it is. \n\nI have a friend who is always, ALWAYS late. I went to see a movie with her, she was late and she'd have beeen really upset if I had gone in alone, so I didn't. I really want to see the whole movie. Second time, I tell her I *will* go in if she's late again. Guess what, she's late again and I had gone in. She was upset. So nowadays, I go out with her for drinks and I bring a book. She's not a movie friend. Your friend is not a Disney friend.", "NTA, that\u2019s a lot of time, effort and money put in to not be able to enjoy the whole day", "NTA. As someone who is ~280 lbs, I work in a state park and walk at least 10,000 steps a day, but usually more like 15,000. I am very capable of walking & hiking, even being overweight, I just tend to eat too large of portions & not always the healthiest, but in terms of walking I am capable. She just sounds lazy. I get the body hurting thing but that\u2019s why she needs to do more walking.", "NTA. I read a comment that you pay for the both of you to go and then after all that money she can't stay for long because of her weight. Can she not ride in the mobility carts? Or does she just not do rides at all? If those are a no, then you should not go. You should also tell her why then.", "\u201cAITA for being considerate of my friends needs?\u201d No. Full stop. NTA.", "Oh no thank you. I'm a big girl but if I'm shelling out that kind of money \ud83e\udd11 I'm staying till closing. I get you though my older sister is really big and really lazy so I would never ever go with her. It would be the most disappointing trip ever.", "NTA but I kind of laughed at the sympathetic to her needs part. She doesn't need to go to Disney and could have taken up the offer to do literally anything else that doesn't involve hundreds of dollars.", "Nta, at all.", "NTA. Every thing is not for everybody. \n\nSomeone who needs to constantly sit down isn't someone who can endure a day at Disney.", "NTA- the whole point of an activity is to enjoy it.  Your reasons are totally valid.", "NTA: Your fixation on her weight for as much as you stress that you don't care about, is odd and comes off assholey.\n\nThat said, I get your friend being upset that you aren't wanting to do more active stuff with her. It may help to consider activities that are still more active but won't cost you an arm and a leg.", "NTA as it relates to not wanting to waste money by having to leave early. Weight is just such a touchy subject.", "NTA but perhaps you can offer a compromise. Like a weekly walk until she can manage a three mile hike on flatish ground without a rest. I think if she built up that level of stamina with you, you wouldn't mind sitting to rest at Disney more than you would if alone, but not so much it would ruin the fun.", "NTA but I suspect you'd have better results if you'd just immediately laughed and said \"You know there is like 15 miles a day of walking at Disney, we wouldn't get past 9am haha\".", "So, I think this is more an issue of you having different vacation styles. Even if she weren\u2019t as heavy, she still might not want to go go go like you do. \n\nI too want my money\u2019s worth and I don\u2019t want to sit around the hotel. My partner wants more downtime. We would get to the park when it opened, walk around together and ride some rides, then split up. On the days the park opened early I would get there at opening and they would sleep in and come a little later. Maybe your friend would be open to something like that. \n\nThere are also some activities that have rest built in, like the Hall of Presidents. When we went, there were fast passes but I think they schedule rides now to avoid standing in line. You can also go during a less busy time of year. We went in September and barely had any lines. NAH", "NTA. You *are* being considerate of her needs by suggesting activities suited to her mobility limitations.", "NTA at all, people saying 'yes' are just upset because you hit a nerve. People need personal accountability,  full stop.", ">Again I support her regardless as IDGAF if someone is 125 lbs or 300, who cares. \n\nIf you are her friend, you absolutely should care. She's slowly killing herself, can't parttake in normal social activities. Not due to illness but due to her choices.\n\nOf course NTA.", "NTA. You don't ridicule her for her weight and accept that she is obese. She needs a reality check that just because someone accepts you for you does not mean it gives you automatic invites for everything. You are accommodating by providing activities that are more suited to her energy level and lifestyle. If she wanted to go to Disneyland, she needed to make serious lifestyle changes or just go on her own to waste her money frivolously.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m fat but even at my largest (5\u20192\u201d 280 lbs.) I could hoof it all day for three days at a theme park while some people not as fat as I couldn\u2019t manage one.  Being fat takes a toll on how much standing/walking one can do but there is a willpower component to it as well.  She doesn\u2019t seem to have the will to push herself to walk for a day.  I think the beach option would be a great compromise.  And fun too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I do not want to speculate as to reasons why, but she needs this to validate her unhealthy life style.  She expects you to cater to her, indulge and accommodate, accept and assist, yet questions your desire to exercise or otherwise not partake of her self destructive habits.

If you are having a hard time politely declining, just tell her you have other plans.\n\nAlso, not all overweight people are lazy. You should put on a weight vest and try to do all the everyday things you normally do and see how it feels.

If she likes the mobility scooter well enough, she may be able to get one for herself.\n\nI understand that using a mobility scooter is not a productive way for her to go about her weight issue, but it'll give her some freedom at least. Then perhaps at some point you can introduce activities to her that don't seem like exercise but will get her to move more.\n\nWhile visiting with her at either your place or hers, put some music on and do a bit of dancing.

Do that for about 15-30 minutes, depending on what kind of music you have on and what she can endure.\n\nYou can also give her help with her household tasks or ask her to help you with yours. Again, put on some music so it doesn't feel like drudgery. Do the dishes, fold the laundry, or straighten the bathroom.

Disney is one of those activities where you have to be there all day to get your moneys worth.

Sometimes people need to hear the hard truth in a nice way, \u201cI\u2019d love to to Disney, but due to the expense, I want to walk around all day with only a few breaks.  I know you are not comfortable doing that, so maybe you can find someone ease to go with that will be okay with less.  I do enjoy doing a lot of other things with you and so I have been suggesting those.\u201d", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility to regulate her. A long time former friend would do this to me. Suggest we go out and do something that required walking or some sort of effort and then either cancel the day of or we were only out for a very short amount of time. I drove across 3 states to go visit her the last time I saw her; it had been 6 years since we had physically seen each other. She got really upset at me (i ended our friendship of 20 years) because I started to just out for walks without her with my dogs. Sorry I want to go out and do the fucking shit and you hold me up EVERY TIME, not sorry. There\u2019s more to the story which contributed to the end of our friendship; it wasn\u2019t just this one incident. This was just the straw that broke the camels back ya know", "Maybe she could rent a scooter? However, not sure if she could comfortably fit in many of the rides. Still NTA.", "NTA. She says you\u2019re not being sympathetic enough of her needs, but what about your needs? She can go with another friend who is happy to \u201caccommodate\u201d her pace, so why is she expecting you to \u201caccommodate\u201d her? I\u2019ve been in your shoes where a friend will invite me along a nature walk, but then stroll at a very slow pace and stop to take pictures (and takes a good 5 minutes to take the photo on their phone). I eventually had to decline those invites because I like a steady walk and I hated the slow pace and the constant stops. It turned something that should be enjoyable into something I hate. Why should you sacrifice your enjoyment for hers when there are other people she would be more compatible with in this regard?\n\nThe only way I\u2019d be able to put aside my displeasure of her pace would be to suggest that she pay for your way also. Unless I have something else planned for that day, I\u2019m usually happy tagging along doing stuff with someone at their pace if it\u2019s on their dime. But if I\u2019m spending my own money, I\u2019m going to do things as I want to do them.", " NTA but you are missing out on a chance to skip all the lines.

I think it's okay to be honest with her as to why you don't want to go to Disney.  I think as friends, it's our duty to say the hard things to the ones we love. You sound very respectful of her and your friendship so I'm sure if you come across the same way to her, she'll understand.  She may be hurt at first, but if so, that'll be on her.", "I mean, NTA, you don't have to go if you don't want to go.\n\nBut there is an awful lot of very specific judgement that sounds a bit resentful here for someone who \"supports her anyway IDGAF\".   You could've just came here and asked if you were an asshole for not going because she doesn't do Disneyland the same way you like to, but you decided to post a laundry lists of faults and poor decisions to internet strangers. \n\nIt's very possible that you actually do have some judgement and resentment here, and that's coming out when you talk to your friend about stuff like this.", "NTA - Don\u2019t enable their terrible life choices.", "NTA - your reasons are valid.

I don't think you're wrong for not wanting to shell out money for experiences like this and I don't think your friend was wrong to ask you.\n\nI think you should really consider that your friend does actually know that her lifestyle is unhealthy and is likely trying to use you as motivation to do at least some kind of exercise. Trying to find things to do where you don't exercise at all is very likely disheartening to her and it's discouraging her from doing something she already doesn't like or feels bad at or whatever. I think that if you value her friendship you should really consider trying to find some kind of middle ground here.", "NTA. Disney prices have SKYROCKETED since COVID - to the point we were supposed to go for our 5 year anniversary in October and opted to spend our whole vacation at Universal instead of splitting the trip. $200+ per day is too much, especially since not only can your friend not manage it, she also won\u2019t be able to go on most of the rides so will guilt you into not doing them either. You are awesome for suggesting alternate options.", "Can she even go on the rides? Last time I went, I was 200 lb and some of the rides were way too tight for me.", "I'm going against the grain here. When you explained that you don't want \"drop coin at Disney\" because your idea of a good time is not \"sitting every 5 minutes and leaving after two hours because her feet hurt...\" I totally get where you're coming from. But, then you get all judgy saying your friend is \"extremely lazy\" and \"doesn't want to get healthy or lose weight\". For that, YTA. Have you thought that maybe, your friend wanting to do more active things with you gives her the confidence to \"excercise\"?", "NTA but if she's your friend you should be talking to her about this and not us...\n\nI'm disabled and can barely walk far without pain. I understand I'm no fun to do a lot of things with but my friends would still invite me, and that was the most important part. None of those things cost much money though. I'd HATE to bring down the fun for people who had spent a load on the day. \n\nIt's sad because your friend probably has nobody else to ask who will agree to it, so it'll be painful for her to hear. Just because someone's feelings are hurt, doesn't mean the thing didn't need to be said. It's why I appreciate my best friend so much - he tells me the truth when I ask for it, even if it hurts. Sometimes we NEED to hear it.", "NTA.", "Yeah I said no and offered alternatives I think that\u2019s what made her peeved as she felt I was suggesting she can\u2019t handle Disney (which is true she can\u2019t and I don\u2019t want to enjoy the park alone, it\u2019s depressing).", "Yeah I said no and offered alternatives I think that\u2019s what made her peeved as she felt I was suggesting she can\u2019t handle Disney (which is true she can\u2019t and I don\u2019t want to enjoy the park alone, it\u2019s depressing).", "Doesn't Disney have those sit down scooters for people who can't walk much? I haven't been but my friend has and she said there's tons of people all over the place in them. I feel like if the friend is going embrace being a big girl she might aswell commit and get a scooter.

Started with a 30 min treadmill plan each time I went to the gym. I told her we can do anything else and she just seemed disappointed but I can\u2019t really justify or afford to waste $200 on a lackluster time and I would rather do something we both can keep up with / enjoy.

I believe the only way you and your friend would both enjoy a trip to Disney is with a larger group which included people of both you and her abilities/interests.\n\nI went to an amusement park with my daughter's scout group once. There were about 16 of us. Some of the group were very active and rushed around doing many things. We took a slower pace due to my daughter's health issues and skipped some things that weren't within her ability. In a big place there is something for everyone (rides, shows, shops, restaurants,  etc.), and no one can do it all.  \n\nWe'd all meet every couple hours to touch base where we were headed next.

Some of us also left for the hotel earlier than the rest. \n\nWhen talking it over later, everyone had experiences to enthuse over and things they regretted missing.

Get her to go on walks with you near the home. It can even be a 5 minute walk around the complex. During the walk, talk about things you would both like to do farther down the road. Short walks are a great start to getting out of a sedentary life style.

It sounds like your friend just refuses to try to keep going, which is also probably why she won't spend time in the gym, it's easier to not change lifestyles and put a bit of a workout in. It's actually a shame, because finding friends that want to do things like that with you, who want to spend time doing fun stuff, is tough to do.

Needless to say we ended up renting a wheelchair within 10 minutes of being there. She barely made it to the front of Cinderella's castle before we had to give up and get a wheelchair.\n\nWe did find out that they have motorized wheelchairs you can rent and I'm assuming Disneyland would have them if Disneyworld has them!
