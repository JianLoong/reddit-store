When she moved back home, we made a deal where she would cook and clean the house as a form of payment for her living here. She agreed to it, and we both thought it was fair.\n\nHowever, recently, she approached me and said that the cooking and cleaning are taking up too much of her time, making it hard for her to study and complete her homework. She asked if I could reduce the number of days she has to cook to give her more time for her studies.\n\nI told her that she should be grateful for the deal I offered her and that it's not that hard to do a few hours of chores compared to what many kids her age are going through. I pointed out that some of her peers are working 9-5 while going to school simultaneously, and I've given her the luxury of just handling some household chores in exchange for free housing.\n\nShe ended up calling her aunt(my sister) behind my back to complain about how I'm treating her, and my sister called me, and kind of went off on me, basically saying I'm being too strict and should listen to my daughter.\n\nHere's where I'm unsure if I'm being an asshole. I want to stick to the agreement we made, but my sister's words have me questioning my stance. AITA for not wanting to change the deal we initially made? I thought it was a fair deal.\n\nEdit: Well I wasn't expecting this post to blow up. Just to address some things. For one I'm my Daughter's Father, not stepmother. Her mother is no longer with us and I'm currently single. So this isn't a Cinderella story. Two, I'm not sexist for making my daughter cook for my son's who are only children. They don't know how to cook, let alone clean themselves. Three, I'm not trying to take advantage of my daughter. As I said in my post, a lot of people her age would die to be in the position she's in right now. I'm paying for her college and all I expect back from her is a homemade meal. I appreciate the feedback, but a lot of bad assumptions were made about me so I had to clear it up.", "created_utc": 1699269542, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17p0hu7/aita_for_expecting_my_daughter_to_stick_to_our/", "score": 4200, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are treating your daughter like a live in maid.  2) the sexist comments are not because you aren't making your boys do the same thing but because it's abundantly obvious that if your daughter *was* a boy you wouldn't be making your oldest into a house elf.  3) your insistence on comparing to *other people* just makes you look like an even bigger AH because there are a lot more *other people* who don't charge their kids rent in terms of money or labor when they are 20 and in school.

Tuition and rent are insanely high making it near impossible for anyone to get through school without parental support or taking on an insane amount of debt.

Look at how long her \"work\" day is. 4 hours of classroom time in higher education regularly requires at least the same amount of time (if not significantly more) for independent study, not to mention how nearing any sort of exams those extracurricular hours explode.

We\u2019ll split it at $20/hr. so that\u2019s $400 a week, around $1700 a month. If she was working that as a job, we can figure approximately 30% for tax, FICA, etc. so she\u2019d bring home roughly $1200 a month.\n\nUnless you live in downtown NYC or San Francisco, renting a bedroom in a house is no where near that. The high rates I\u2019ve seen for room rentals in places I\u2019ve lived had been $7-800. More than likely it would be closer to $5-600. You\u2019re effectively charging her twice the going rate for room and board. \n\nYou need to evaluate how many hours she is putting in, what a fair and reasonable rate for room and board is, and how many hours she should work weekly to meet that. For reference, if you agree on $600 a month, she should be working 10-12 hrs per week.\n\nAre you TA for expecting your daughter to be responsible and contribute in exchange for room and board. No. But you definitely will be TA if you don\u2019t make some serious adjustments to this set up.", "YTA for not letting your 20 year old daughter live with you free.

Others may do work and school as to afford to pay for their tuition.\n\nEither way way your daughter isn't a chef or a maid service to be taken advantage of because she can't afford a place on her own.

It's like you don't want her to succeed. Yes real life is hard but as her parent you should have her best interests at heart and right now to her it looks like you don't.

It is actually important to get to know professors when it comes time for references for scholarship applications, internships and jobs after graduation. Also relationships with other students can bring success in many different ways. There are clubs devoted to majors and possibly speaker series that link to her major that can boost her knowledge and lead to job contacts. If she misses all of this, it will not be to her benefit. \n\nI\u2019m a parent of college-age kids. No one I know personally would set up this kind of arrangement.

I wouldn\u2019t view that as some kind of \u201cfavor,\u201d I\u2019d be happy to have the additional time with them. And my home is their home anytime they need it to be. \n\nSure, I\u2019d expect them to pitch in with household chores equally with everyone else living here and certainly not to create messes for me to clean up. But I\u2019d never view it as him owing me rent money or extra labor in lieu of rent. (Things would be different if we were struggling and there are times that it\u2019s fair for everyone to step up for the good of the group, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue for OP).\n\nAnd where is this parent\u2019s desire to support their child\u2019s success? As a parent of kids this age nothing is more important than their academic success as I want them to begin their professional lives with as many good options as possible. I would never ask my kid to do so much housework that it didn\u2019t leave adequate time for daily studies and any other things they need (including r&r and a social life) to be successful. \n\nI guess some parents just view their kids as nothing more than people they can get stuff out of. It\u2019s really sad.", "Also, isn't there supposed to be love, and wanting to support your child to succeed, factored into the equation?", "Agreed. We started saving when they were babies so that our kids could hopefully go away to college and learn to live independently. If they were to live at home  while going to school, I wouldn\u2019t expect any more of them than I would of a high schooler (keep your room clean, take care of your laundry, unload the dishwasher, walk the dog etc). I\u2019d rather them have a part time job than wait on me hand and foot to earn their right to sleep in their childhood bedroom.", "I think the word you are looking for is slave not maid.

Also agreeing with the \u201ca parent is not a landlord\u201d reply. Finding out she\u2019s being parentified as well is horrible. This poor girl being treated like this is a one-way ticket to resenting her parent, and resentment is one step away from hatred. \n\nMy Mob Spawner treated me like a tenant as a disabled adult and gouged me for rent\u2014 I couldn\u2019t save money or move forward. She was the landlord, and what she did was definitely a form of financial abuse. \n\nI\u2019m now moved out and completely NC with her. Some people genuinely should not be parents, ever. If you do not want to sign up for unconditional love and support toward your children, for the love of god, do not have children. Sometimes they will need support even in adulthood.\n\nSo many people from previous generations are out of touch with reality and how difficult and expensive life is as a whole now.\n\nEDIT: Saw another comment calling these parents and these relationships with their children cold and transactional and I cannot help but agree. Parents, remember YOU brought these children into the world. They did not choose to be here. It is your job and responsibility to care for the humans YOU made the conscious choice to create (barring situations where there was no choice, it unfortunately happens).\n\nYour children do not owe you anything. And you do not get to decide if you were a good parent or not\u2014 they do. And if you treat them poorly, you\u2019ll end up alone and withering away in a nursing home, and your children will not be to blame for that.", ">cook and clean everyday like a maid\n\nIf daughter was doing this for a family that wasn't her own, she would be making far more money than what she's saving in rent & utilities now.", "Seriously this mindset is mind-blowing, but I feel like it's an american thing (again lol) I never once met a person here in France that would think that once the kid is 18 it's no longer their problem or that they have to pay a rent for their own home???

Obviously he doesn't need the rent money if he agreed to a trade off, and it's not like she's living with him while not in school or working at all - so why make her life harder than it needs to be? Yeah, she should clean up after herself and contribute where she can, but effectively turning her into a maid just because she's...what, not a minor?\n\nOP is her parent, not her manager, but apparently the concept of actually putting your kids first to set them up for success is foreign to him.", "I agree with everything you said. The question OP should be asking herself is if she wants her daughter to succeed at school or not. Does OP want to be responsible for her failure? Maybe she wants a full time maid, not a successful daughter.", "I'm also wondering if OP is giving us all of the INFO here.

Just because some people have to work a full time job while going to school doesn't mean they should. They don't have a choice, and often their school work suffers because of it. The fact they're making her \"pay rent\" while in college is kind of crazy. Most parents don't mind their kids staying home for post secondary because it means they don't have to worry about paying for rent and can focus on their studies.

I generally fall on the line of people, including adult children, pulling their weight, but this deal seems excessive. OP is expecting their college student kid to be a live-in maid AND cook. That's a lot.

Son and girlfriend, 20 and 21, moved in to save faster for a house of their own. They wanted to pay us something and we said absolutely not. Just invite us over to your future house from time to time. I am so happy we are in a position to help them, and also see my son every day. My son did chores when he was a minor and now as an adult, he doesn\u2019t have to be asked to keep up his portion of the house, which is all I would feel comfortable asking if him. Although if I asked more of him, I know he would do it. They actually remodeled their bathroom and made some improvements in the few months they\u2019ve been here but again I would have never asked that of them. Fair market value of the space/utilities we provide them is probably around $800 at most. I guarantee you they would both rather work a couple extra shifts per month and pay us that than have to cook and clean for us on the daily. I know I would! I like to think that when they settle into their new house they will remember how much their parents encouraged and supported them rather than how we made them feel like children doing chores or the household employees. \nThat said, I don\u2019t think a few chores is unreasonable at all but I feel like at 20 and in school full time it\u2019s not unreasonable to just support your child and not expect anything extra for yourself in return.", "He thinks is unreasonable because he got a free maid and is not willing to back out of it even if his daughter is expressing she can\u2019t keep up with her studies with this arrangement \n\nYTA", "Yes.  It\u2019s very telling that the chore she brought up is cooking.  No doubt OP expects meals to be served at specific times.  But meal prep is labour intensive.  This may not work with her daughter\u2019s college schedule, especially if OP dictates what foods are to be prepared (which I think is likely as there is no mention of the daughter buying the food or having any say over it).  When I was a student and living on my own for those years, I had to work around bus schedules, classes and other commitments, studying, and just being plain tired.  Having dinner every day at 6 o clock was just not happening.  I also didn\u2019t have time to devote to learning how to make complex dishes.  Some flexibility really is required here.", "Right? Even in my workplace (I understand that many work places don't care about their employees like this, but it's more normal where I am for jobs and managers to care about their workers), when people are feeling overwhelmed we adjust our schedules to accommodate them needing a couple extra days off a week for a few weeks or months or an extended period of time off so they're able to deal with whatever they need to, to be able o not be overwhelmed and burned out. I can't imagine the people I live with, who are supposed to be family, not giving the same, if not better courtesy and support than a place of employment. Employees are people first, workers second.

Well enough to microwave something himself.", "Honestly, I dint know what's worse: her having to do the grocery shopping too, or her having to put together 8 meals a week without having control over what food is available to her to cook with. Really no right answer there.", "When I was 10 I made my own breakfast every day. You don't need an adult to make toast or cereal or a glass of juice. The 10 year old can help the 8 year old.", "8 and 10 is old enough to make your own breakfast AND do a bunch of housework. There's some time savings right there. They're not babies.", "My parents used to work late when I was a kid, so several days a week, I had to cook dinner and have it ready for them when they got home. This started when I was 8 years old, so yes, the sons absolutely can learn how to cook and clean for themselves. I would bet anything that OP is a man who thinks cooking and cleaning is a woman's job, and that's why the daughter is expected to do everything while OP and sons don't do shit.", "THEY'RE 8 AND 10? no no no. I was cooking dinner for my family at that age, not to mention doing all of the laundry. FOH.", "This was me before I went to college. I was expected to clean, including all of the household laundry, shop for groceries, and start meals for the household, because in Caribbean culture the youngest daughter gets to be the mule of the family.\n\nWhen I went AWAY to college, I had to work and took out student loans, but I could focus on my studies and my part time job was my pocket money. Any holidays I went home I wound up cleaning, because the household knew I was coming home and would let things pile up, including laundry.", "Bingo, this right here", "Just because some of OP's peers are suffering doesn't mean it's a good thing. Why doesn't OP want the best for his child, and want her to succeed as much as she can? Being a full-time student is usually equivalent in time to a full-time job; when I worked part-time, I was a server (so more flexible hours) and would study in a back manager's room when the business was slow. Once I could no longer do that, I had to quit. I just didn't have enough time in my week anymore.", "So basically, OP wants a slave for herself and her sons instead of a daughter. Why are the sons not expected to help when they live there as well? Sounds like this mom shouldn't be surprised when daughter goes full no contact after she graduates.", "She's basically been given a large chunk of responsibilities that a stay at home mom does, pretty much everything but the actual child rearing and helping the other kids in the house with schooling. As a stay at home mom, and former full time student and full time employee, I'd be dead beat tired if I also had to cook multiple meals for multiple people and clean an entire house in addition to any studying or working I had to do at school.", "Wait...WAT  \nWTF are the brothers doing in the way of chores and cooking?  \nThis needs more information.   \nIf OP is making his daughter do all of this and nothing for her brothers, then he is massively TA.   \nI hope his daughter moves in with her aunt and cuts him off.", "Agreed! I went to school full-time while working full-time. It was awful. Just because someone else had to do it doesn't make a good thing for everyone else to have to do. It was a massive struggle and I would definitely take on more responsibility to lighten the load for my child.", "This is part of the reason why residential colleges are so expensive- you pay for the room and board so you can focus on your studies.", "I am. Thank you!", "I burnt out at the same time and going to school year round 4 days after graduating high school took a toll on me physically and mentally.", "ya cause they're boys, and boys don't cook and clean as their father has demonstrated /s", "Yeah, the edit is wild and really lends credence to this comment. \n\nThe sons are eight and ten; they should absolutely be able to help clean.", "I\u2019d put money that they don\u2019t clean up after themselves because that\u2019s her job.", "Assuming everything goes to plan the whole evening. The moment something is out of sync that time estimate doesn't leave any room for flex.", "Shoot my mom started cooking when she was like 5 or 6. It's funny to say but people infantilize children (BOYS mainly) too much. The earlier you teach these things the better same as hygiene habits like brushing their teeth after every meal and showering before bed. People act like it's completely impossible to stand there and monitor their kid when they're near a stove as if they wouldn't be by the stove when meals are made anyway. And if anything it'll split the work load a little so the parent doesn't have to do everything themself all the time.\n\nMy stepmom complains about having to do all the cooking and cleaning herself but downright refuses to teach my brother. Like make it make sense. I bet you're glad you know how to cook for yourself though! My parents didn't think to teach me and now I live off canned food and stuff from my job.", "That\u2018s awful! How lazy can people be to not do their own laundry?", "I wouldn\u2019t have gone home. Or if I did, I would act like a guest and do NO chores. If someone complained, I\u2019d tell them the family mule has gone to greener pastures.", "I hate when something is blatantly abusive and it\u2019s hidden under the term \u201cculture\u201d\n\nMy father is an immigrant and he would say oh this is how everyone back home does it and then his family would visit and we would ask certain things about if they really did this or that back home and they would laugh and say nobody\u2019s done that in 30 years.\n\nThe point is culture is fluid and there is absolutely no reason to accept or hold onto something for the sake of it when it\u2019s hurting others.", "I remember when I started working full time, after I was done with grad school.  I had SO much time compared to an engineering undergrad + materials science masters degree + lab work + extracurriculars.  I literally didn't know what to do with myself, because l only had to work from 9am-6pm five days per week.  \n\nDuring school, I was studying so hard and was doing so much to build my resume by taking on campus leadership roles / working in a research lab.  I would have been much less competitive applying to grad school (full scholarship) or entering the workforce if I would have had extra pressure at home.", "Mine had an expectation of one hour of home/study work for every hour in class. \n\nAnd a lot of the stem programs had 30+ hours per week of expected class time. \n\nAdd in job, club and exercise and I was basically only ever home to crash for 7 hours before I got up and did it all again.", "I worked for 3 semesters of my undergrad. One of those semesters, I actually had 2 jobs.\n\nI got by with sleeping 4 hours a night, and then catching naps between classes, in my car before work/during breaks, and maybe an hour after I got off work so I'd be good to drive home.\n\nLooking back on it now, I have no idea what the fuck I was doing, other than killing myself. You'd think I would have gotten the hint after the first time I collapsed from exhaustion, but nah... took two more times to finally call it off.", "I did, burned out in like 2 years. Alot of people do it as they are not independently wealthy", "I did, my senior year.  I was also a double major.  I had to make up the time somewhere, so sleeping and eating didn\u2019t happen much.  Looking back, I don\u2019t know how I did it and I wouldn\u2019t suggest it for anyone else.", "Ikr??? Why does she have to make them all breakfast? The 10 yo can\u2019t pour himself a bowl of cereal?", "Get this\u2026she has to make breakfast and dinner for the two brothers who are 8 & 10 plus the parent. Op claims the 8 & 10 yo boys are too young to help or even make their own breakfast. She also has to do all the house cleaning.", "Cooking every night is just not efficient. I honestly think that meal prepping is better overall. The amount of food made when prepping is the same, but the cleaning can literally be cut down to an eighth if you portion it correctly. Time is a valuable resource, why waste it like that?", "That's about how I do it, though I sometimes bulk a few different meals and freeze them so that I can alternate if I really don't want to eat spaghetti for the fourth night in a row. It's less time consuming and if you do it right, you can mix and match some stuff as well", "Reddit is NOT a free speech platform.", "And you'd have to pay me a lot more than the rent of a single room if you want me to do THAT. \n\nIt feels very much like she being used, like you suggest. Poor girl.", "Divorce has changed my life for the better I swear!", "WITH IRONING.\n\nLike, the youngest Caribbean daughter is seen as an insurance policy ( I am sure this is the case in African American and some Asian subcultures as well) so you get to learn and do all the housework related stuff at a young age, and then starting as  a teenager you are expected to get it done, within a time frame, school or activities be damned. \n\nIt's good to know how to do things, not good to be used as a mule or servant because of historical trauma.", "Oh as soon as graduated, I would go back to NYC to visit...and stay in a hotel. Just enough time to hi and bye and have a great one, then go back to my room in PEACE.", "Yeah, I can\u2019t imagine having to cook full meals every day in addition to my demanding full time job. Ramen, sandwiches, and canned soup are staples in my rotation, and my only friends who really cook full meals frequently during the week and have full time jobs are people for whom that is also a fun and relaxing hobby. For those of us for whom it is just a chore, it\u2019s a lot to spend all day working and also have to meal plan and prep and cook every evening.", "Fellow (late) 40s club checking in.\n\nI work AND take CE classes for my field, and maintain a house & garden. I am POOPED. \n\nI remember working as a housekeeper in college for a resort. I was exhausted, and thank goodness I did not need to then cook meals!", "Full time job, single parenting, and going to school full time plus my kids extracurriculars. I\u2019m lucky to cook a meal 2x a week. And there are definitely areas of my house that are sorely lacking and this is with my kids assistance maintaining the house.", "WORSE:\n\nSAHP make household management THEIR JOB. OP is treating her daughter like a servant.", "Yes, exactly. It wasn\u2019t an option. I needed the money to pay for school even after a scholarship and loans.  I would never let my own children even try it.  It wrecked my body.", "This. I worked full time while getting my degree and the only reason I ate regular meals was because of the hospital cafeteria where I worked. I only slept 2-4 hrs per night for most of 4 years. By the time I graduated I was too burned out to find a job in the field I studied for.", "You are correct. He is a man.", "OP's daughter is the substitute mommy, which is pretty horrid.", "It's been different for sure! But my daughter and I have adjusted pretty well.  We've had to get a new cleaning schedule for the both of us. But overall my anxiety has reduced a crazy amount", "You're a good person. This is so empathetic, reality-based, and wise! Thanks for making the world less awful x", "It kinda sorta sounds like OP is treating her like the wife that is no longer there. Not in a creepy sexual way, but sounds like he wants daughter to have the same attitude toward cleaning and cooking a \"homemade meal\" that a 50s wife would.", "Cinderella is who came to mind. Especially once I seen his edit, where he mentions younger siblings/brothers.", "I dont think I ever really recovered mentally from the full time student + full time employee to afford it. That burnout went deep", "Maybe it\u2019s time to switch the culture of school. Not singling you out, but if us as a society said, \u201cwe\u2019re here to work and make money after our basic education, then whoever hires us, sends us to our school for a specific education to be better at our job\u201d until then it\u2019s just the way it is", "I hope you're doing better now", "Like- breakfast can be cold cereal or microwave oatmeal for pete's sake!", "I did my masters and phd internationally and working on a student visa was a mess. So I just didnt and that honestly is the only reason I recovered. As long as I dont think about my mountain of student loan debt lol", "There are plenty of ways we could reconstruct our education system that would be beneficial to the economy, students, schools, society in general, but getting our corporate overlords to agree to something on a broader scale that costs them money... well seems extremely difficult and unlikely.", "As long as we hit post apocalyptic dystopia where money is no longer money but maybe something like bottle caps ... I think outrunning our loans remains viable"]}
