I've got an embarrassing conflict that I'd rather not present to my friends, so I need the anonymous power of reddit and all you judgement-giving strangers to help me out.\n\nMy sister (28f) got married in late April. I (25m) been hanging out with her father in law, Thomas (mid 40s), ever since. It's not like we're seeing each other on the daily, just every other weekend or so. We grab drinks or just hang out at his home, nothing nefarious. Still, I've never brought it up to my sister because it's never came up.\n\nLast night, we were hanging out like we usually do. I'm typically in charge of playing music for us and cyber sex by Doja Cat came on the playlist I had queued up. Thomas was amused by the lyrics and was asking me where I found the song, it was a funny moment. We moved on, I left after a while.\n\nThis morning when I woke up, I sent him a text along with a link to the song as a joke. Turns out my sister and her husband were visiting at this point and my BIL was in the middle of looking at something on Thomas' phone when the message came through. Apparently it caused a huge stir and resulted in BIL confronting his father about the whole thing.\n\nMy sister called me later and asked why I was sending her father in law \"lewd\" messages, or hanging out with him at all. I tried to explain the situation like I did here, that he and I grab drinks and catch up occasionally after finding things in common during her wedding weekend but it hasn't gone well.\n\nI'm starting to feel guilty about the whole thing because she said I was interfering with her married life.

Are you attracted to him?", "Info- Are you gay OP?", "Are you interested in the FIL? Do you think he might be into you?", "NTA. You guys are adults and can do whatever you want. Just keep in mind if you guys take it somewhere and breakup later and either one gets hurt... It would be very uncomfortable for your sister or BIL to support either one of you.  That could get very messy for everyone involved.", "Nta, whether you're friends or dating, doesn't matter. It's not your sister's business", "I don\u2019t think your an ass for hanging out with him or for texting him what you did. The only thing I think is kinda assish is the not telling your sister that you\u2019ve been hanging out with her FIL regularly. The only reason I say this is because even though yes you have every right to hang out with whoever you wish the only reason you know this man is because of your sister and being at her wedding which is to his son. Not to mention think of how you would feel in her situation. You are at your in laws place and your SO sees a text on their phone from your sister saying something similar. You would probably be a little pissed that your sister didn\u2019t tell you that she had been hangin w around your in law without telling her or ever mentioning it. Plus it could be awkward for the son as his dad is hanging out with someone younger than his wife. \n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong I don\u2019t think having an older friend is wrong I\u2019m friends with people in their 50s and I\u2019m 29. People can get along with many different ages of people. And even if you were both interested in each other romantically I would be a bit apprehensive because of the age gap but at the same time your both adults and allowed to do what you want. \n\nBut I do think you should apologize for keeping it from your sister and don\u2019t say you weren\u2019t it just never came up cause that\u2019s just a lie by omission. You knew she would probably not like it and you didn\u2019t want to deal with that. But I don\u2019t think you should apologize for talking to him or being his friend cause that\u2019s your business. Also the effecting her married life? Makes zero sense unless her new hubby is blaming her and her family aka you of like corrupting his father or if her new hubby is calling you names or something and she\u2019s defending you but since she seems to be pissed at you to I don\u2019t see how this is effecting her married life but maybe I just don\u2019t understand marriage all that well.", "Yes, she does think something is happening between the two of us.\n\nI should've clarified in the OP that I'm openly bisexual. I typed it out without thinking about the fact that strangers wouldn't know that already, lol.\n\nHer FIL is single. She objected to both the text/song lyrics and us hanging out without her knowledge.", "Im friends with my mates dad. He's 20 something years older but ive always just seen him as one of the boys. When we hang out it's just like hanging with anyone else really and all we get out of it is eachothers company. If anything the generational gap just makes our friendship more interesting as we share things the other isn't aware of or hasn't experienced. \n\nI dont think there's anything weird about their friendship. And I think that people who feel the need to be suspicious about it is close minded and cynical.", "Yeah, op mentioned that he would be down for stuff to happen. This is weird\ud83d\ude2d", "[deleted]", "Why is it inappropriate??", "Ignoring this specific situation for a moment because it\u2019s a bit extra. What\u2019s unusual about having friends who are significantly different ages?\nMy best friend is ten years older than me and a very good friend i made through work has been working at our company almost as long as i have been alive.", "The text said \"morninggg. putting this on this a.m. and thinking of you, lol\"", "He\u2019s being so coy for no reason.\n\nWhether they f\u2019d or not he needs to stop pretending like he\u2019s to not trying loll", "I'm not totally against the idea of something happening.

Nothing much is currently going on, tho.", "The FIL is single (OP stated earlier in thread).", " Not girl, bi boy.", "OP is also bi.", "This is a weird take. So the sides of the family should never hang out? That seems really unhealthy.

Different strokes for different folks \ud83d\ude09", "Op literally said he would be down for something. He has a thing for his sisters FIL", "Yeah, but did you originally start hanging out with your mate and his dad together for a while? Or did you suddenly start up the friendship without your mate\u2019s knowledge? Context matters here.", "The weird part isn't the age gap, it's the keeping it quiet because it \"never came up\". How is keeping regular contact with your sisters father in law (ie actively visiting him at home regularly to the point there is a 'normal' routine) something that doesn't come up? That feels like something you have to consciously not talk about for it not to be relevant.  \n\nLike, there was no \"I talked to your wedding weekend. We seem to have a lot in common and he seems great!\"?\n\nMaybe I just talk to my siblings more, but I'd be surprised if any of them got a new close friend and I didn't hear about it, especially if it's somebody I know *because they are my in law*. My brother and brother in law are best friends and talk regularly. After they first met, my brother said \"I didn't know he was cool\".  Do... siblings not share this kind of thing?", "How is the FIL the creep when OP is the one sending unsolicited sexual content?", "Because OP is openly making moves on his sister\u2019s new FIL.\n\nNo shade if OP is into older men or if FIL is into younger guys, but this is going to be awkward regardless of whether it goes well or goes badly, and sister\u2019s going to be stuck in the middle.", "Yes, age-gap friendships are possible, but in this case FIL is literally twice OP\u2019s age. (I suspect OP is downplaying the age difference, since FIL would have had to be in his teens when his son was born to be in his mid-40s now.)\n\nI\u2019m FIL\u2019s age. I assure you I have zero interest in hanging out one-on-one with a 25 year old, no matter how mature they are or how much we have in common.", "Are you trying to get into this dude\u2019s pants?", "I feel like this was an important detail to leave out. So you sent him a sexual song and said \u201cthinking of you\u201d? Also the \u201cmorninggg\u201d like\u2026 idk you guys have a really weird situation going on, I don\u2019t blame your sister for being weirded out", "YTA.\n\nYou're flirting with your sisters FIL and said you'd be down for something to happen.\n\nYou're putting her in a precarious position and also just being straight up tacky.", "Thats flirting.", "I mean I can see how that could be misinterpreted, but only you and her FIL know the dynamics of your relationship at the end of the day. \n\nI\u2019m going with NTA. Your sister doesn\u2019t get to police who is friends with who, and I don\u2019t see how you being friends with the FIL impacts her marriage at all. \n\nFeel free not to answer as it\u2019s a sensitive/personal question, but are you gay OP? Could that be why she felt weird about it?", "Looks like a flirty/suggestive text. Given the situation I'd say yta.", "What is \u201cnothing much\u201d? Has anything happened at all?", "Do you have no concept of boundaries?! This is your sister's life and in law! What is WRONG with you?! There are millions of men out there and you go for her FIL?! Seriously?! You don't think it'll be weird for her if you end up with him? You'd be brother AND FIL! Wth?! Stop hanging out with him, cut him off, and find someone else. Stop screwing up your sister's life. YTA", "Oh. So, it's the sister's marriage that o.p. is damaging?\n\nFil isnt married?\nO.p. isn't married?", "Whoops, misread!", "Because op said he would be down for stuff to happen between hom and the FIL.", "You should add that to the OP.", "I didnt see that bit. I mean, not a great idea and has potential to get real messy. But if OPs got daddy issues and likes older dudes and he wants a young stud it's their perogative if they want to bang it out or not. Nothing illegal is happening and who's to say whos feelings trumps whos.", "I dont feel like i would need to urgently fill him in on everything but if it came up i would be fourthcoming. We ended just chatting us two at a wedding and he invited me to come over if i wanted. But we had hung out me, my mate and his dad on several occaisions before that.", "I have 3 siblings and none of us have any idea whats going on in each other's personal lives. 2 dudes hanging out doesnt seem like anything special or important to me so i can absolutely see how it just wouldnt come up. However, now that ive learnt op would totally bone his sisters FIL, i can see how he would want to avoid speaking about their relationship and it makes it kinda deceitful.", "My friend i made through work is 67 and I\u2019m 36 he literally has a daughter my age. I\u2019m not seeing what the issue is there.", "He hadn\u2019t at the time that either of us made our comments, so this person preemptively decided it was creepy.", "Done. :)", "I didn't say it was illegal, but it definitely puts his sister/her husband in the middle of it and in a uncomfortable situation.", "Basically, it\u2019s the nature of the friendship as the OP originally described it. He met a much older man at an event, started hanging out one-on-one several times a week at the guy\u2019s house doing nothing in particular besides drinking and listening to tunes, and has been texting him \u201cinside jokes\u201d when they\u2019re not together.\n\nSorry, but that kind of instant friendship seems pretty weird. (Or rather, it was weird until it became clear that OP and FIL are either hooking up or headed in that direction, in which case it makes a lot of sense.)", "It still was with the text he sent his sisters FIL.", "He also hadn\u2019t disclosed what the message said when this person commented. I know because I\u2019m the one who asked for that info.", "Okay, still I would say it's weird that he hid it from his sister. Idk, this whole thing is strange and doesn't change the fact that it is creepy.", "If he went out of his way to hide it yeah, but that\u2019s not what he said. Given the new info it is leaning toward inappropriate, but to simply hang out with a new family member I don\u2019t think is creepy. They met, the hit it off, the hung out. That\u2019s how friends happen.", "Except this isn't a friend's situation. This is flirting with his sisters father in law. Say they got together (hypothetically ofc) yeah it wouldn't be illegal or anything, but then he would be his sisters father in law and her brother. Thats weird, others may disagree because yeah they are consenting adults, but some boundaries shouldn't be crossed.", "Yes if they got together it would be weird. But they\u2019re not together, they\u2019re hanging out as friends. You can\u2019t be friends without getting to know each other by talking and hanging out. Saying that he wouldn\u2019t mind if something ever happened is not the same as saying \u201cI am actively pursuing something with my sisters FIL\u201d those are two very different things. And unless FIL is also gay/bi, your point is moot."]}
