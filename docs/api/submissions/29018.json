I was around 4 when my biological mother (22F at the time) went to prison. Since my dad (28M at the time) worked offshore and he was gone for a month at a time, my grandmother (42F at the time) was legally made my \"backup guardian.\" It's not quite joint custody, but she's technically a guardian.\n\nWhen my dad would leave for work he would drop my little brother (a couple months old) and I (4F at the time) at my grandmother's house. When my dad would come back from work, my grandmother refused to allow my dad to see us, saying \"oh we have plans\" or \"they're sleeping.\"\n\nEventually my dad contacted the social worker and told her that he wasn't being granted access to his children, so she made legally required visits every once and a while. \n\nIt's important to know that before my dad went to work, he would throw away all of the food that would expire while he was gone, leaving his pantry and fridge pretty empty. When he got back home and picked us up, he would take is to the store and let us pick out some food that we would eat so he would have food for us while we were there.\n\nMy grandmother used this against him by calling the social worker while my dad was on his way home, saying that he has no food, and therefore she will not be sending us over there.\n\nAfter this going on for about 8 months and my dad ALWAYS explaining the situation, she social worker stopped doing anything when my grandmother called, saying \"call me when there's a real problem.\"\n\nFast-forward a couple of years when I'm around 12-14. I'm constantly getting grounded at this age for a multitude of stupid reasons. I got grounded for not folding the laundry (I asked her if she wanted me to fold it an hour beforehand and she told me no, that she would do it), she grounded me for being otp with my friend on speakerphone, and a various of stupid reasons. She wouldn't allow me to call my dad when I was with her or even eat during the day because I \"needed to lose weight.\"\n\nShe started giving me drugs when I was about 11, calling them \"sleepy time pills.\" Later, I found out that she was giving me pain meds.\n\nWhen I came out to her as gay when I was 16, she sent me to a conversion camp WITHOUT TELLING MY DAD, and he thought I was ignoring his messages. He was LIVID with my grandma, and all she told him was \"there won't be any faggots in my goddamn family\"\n\nThis has been going on for years, and finally I'm 18. When I tell her I want to move out, she yells at me, saying \"what if I die? You're just gonna leave me here? To die? All by myself? You don't love me.\"\n\nThat's when I snapped. I started screaming at her, telling her that she was a \"fucking narcissistic, self centered bitch. Get tf over yourself\" \n\nSo, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1697426313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178wkp4/aita_for_telling_my_grandmother_i_dont_want/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
