It's insanity, so many people have died from eating the wrong mushroom or berry throughout history, I can't even imagine how many have died from eating food that isn't safe to eat. Tarrare is like the perfect example of the 'EAT IT' part of a human being broken, but he's not the only one, pica is wild and makes people eat chalk or nails and stuff. What's up with that?

Plus OP said she's been finding the wrappers which means he hasn't been throwing them away properly, and if he doesn't throw away his cheeto wrappers there's a good chance he doesn't throw away his other trash properly either. And since he doesn't seem to think the cheeto dust in bed isn't a problem, that says to me that he isn't the type of person who washes the bed sheets regularly. \n\nSo while eating cheetos in bed is just 'one thing', it points to a person's general attitude towards cleanliness and respect which is a big thing in a relationship.", "Okay but if he can't handle respecting her wishes on something as small as this, why would it be too bold to assume he also wouldn't listen on a larger issue? It is minor, so why can't he just respect that boundary?", "Ooooo.

I did mention how people have died, like, A BUNCH from eating poisonous mushrooms or berries, usually inadvertently. [This](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18065372) is a very interesting article about fugo (pufferfish) in Japan, and mentions that 23 people have died in Japan after eating it since 2000 and why it requires a specially licensed chef to prepare. There's plenty of risk to be had in trying things, especially if it's just something you found in nature rather than had prepared or made by someone who knows how to do it right. Hell, undercooked chicken can kill you and there's also the whole issue of having an unknown allergy and unanticipated reaction. \n\nI think what I'm mostly confused by is the willingness to take the risk even if it's completely unnecessary/ maybe doesn't seem like a great idea. Why eat the dangerous thing if you have the choice not to? But my perspective is obviously limited by my subjectivity. I wouldn't jump out of a perfectly good airplane but my sister loved skydiving. It's not something I get, but I don't have to.
