OP sounds like a gross and very selfish person", "This is really the best answer. Is it really asshole territory to eat in bed? Not if you\u2019re the only one in it obviously. But OP, this is about more than Cheetos.", "That's literally it. I mean sometimes I forget to shower after the run and go to bed, but I haven't done that in a while, so she can't still be mad about that, right?", "And don\u2019t leave it for HER to clean!", "My mom used to say this all the time\u2026 and in reality, there\u2019s very few people I wouldn\u2019t kick out of bed for eating crackers\u2026", "And even if she cant hear it, I bet in the morning she can see the cheeto dust all over the bed linens and thats just terrible.", "Cheetahs are the fastest land animal. Maybe it\u2019s an optimistic interpretation of \u201cyou are what you eat\u201d", "But the bed is comfy", "Thanks", "Noted, lol. And you're right!", "You're in a relationship, so it's not about what you like anymore, stop being selfish. No one wants food in a bed, it's literally disgusting.", "If you won't change this habit then you need to sleep in separate rooms. She likes not being disturbed and not waking up to find herself surrounded by the remains of your snacking. YTA", "Then you are telling her that she is less important to you  than eating in bed is. That may not be what you meant, but it is what you are saying. She may not become fully awake, but you are disturbing her by getting in and out of bed.", "Your ritual will end up with you single if you continue to ignore her concerns.", "Except she does\u2026 you\u2019re making noise chewing, smacking your lips, probably licking your fingers, and digging the Cheetos out of a bag. How old are you!? Just lay on the couch and eat them, then go to bed. It may take a few days to adjust, but this routine will be better for your relationship. You don\u2019t want to be that guy who gets broken up with because of\u2026 Cheetos.", "Dude, let me assure you that she can hear EVERY SINGLE disgusting Cheeto slurp. Not that that's the point.", "So, your relaxation is more important than hygiene or your girlfriend's sleep? Yeah, YTA .", "I don't disagree, I used to eat peanutbutter toast in bed at night in college when stress was messing with my sleep, but I'm married now and I do that shit in the kitchen. Don't want to bug my husband, don't want him to potentially have to deal with crumbs or other spills. Things change when you're in a relationship!", "It doesn't matter that you like it. It's dirty, and your partner doesn't appreciate it. Grow up.", "Are you 14 years old?", "Hi OP! \nLaying down while eating is actually not very good for your body. It increases your risk of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease. Regardless of your relationship, I suggest eating in a seated position for your health.", "Well maybe your girlfriend likes sleeping in her bed without hearing you eat Cheetos?? Who raised you", "He says in a nasally whine.", "I mean, I get that, I used to like it too when I was a teenager, but I'm not anymore, and neither are you.\n\nIt really comes down to this: If you like it more than you like your gf, time to break up and find someone that this doesn't bother. If you like her more than you like eating cheetos in bed, then there's your answer, stop eating them there.\n\nWhen you like someone, you do things that you maybe wouldn't normally want to do. Not eating in the bed is a very, very common thing that many people have a firm line on, so while you may be able to find someone who doesn't mind, for my money, I would stop. It's actually a gross habit and I'm embarrassed to say I used to do it as a teen. You get in the bed and can literally feel crumbs... it's nasty. Don't do that to your gf, if you want to have one still.", "Can you sit on the couch/in a chair and put your feet up? And throw your wrappers out!", "It's a ritual you do as a single person, not as a person in a relationship with someone that doesn't want cheetoh shit in their bed. DO NOT EAT FOOD IN BED. Maybe you need a new ritual for your OCD ass.", "u sound like a child", "Wow. Grow up dude, seriously. Who the hell eats in their bed anyways? Make concessions, you're in a relationship. Jesus. YTA", "If you want to keep doing this you need to make sure 100% of the time you clean up and leave nothing behind.\n\nThat is if you really aren\u2019t disturbing your girlfriend while she is sleeping.", "\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12", "INFO what are your respective waking up times?", "At the expense of relationships? Go for it. But maybe stop bringing women home, knowing you can't hold one with your \"wants\" being bigger than their well-being...", "You know what, you will have a new ritual in the next year... The anniversary of the day your GF dumped you.. this will be a remarkable day to you.", "What are you? A spoiled 8 yr old? Hope your GF heads straight out the door and leaves you in your nest of crumbs", "In other words, you are a narcissist that does what you want, with no regard for anyone else.\n\nYTA.", "You sound like a child.", "You can\u2019t lay on a couch? YTA", "Even if you never make noise (which I doubt since there is still the wrapper making noise) they're still very messy and there is no way to avoid that. Eat them somewhere else.", ">the special way I eat them,\n\nOP is acheeto savant, y'all. So that makes it all good...", "Bro what the fuck does this even mean? The \"special way\" you eat them? Are you 12 years old?", "Dude, that's even more disgusting. Suck on your Cheetos in another room. \ud83e\udd2e", "This is so fucking neurotic. That, and you're missing the forest for the trees.\n\nNobody cares about how convinced you are that you're doing this quietly.\n\nYour girlfriend cares because you're living like a pig and every morning you drag her into your disgusting coop.\n\nYTA. Big time.", "Please stop.", "Are you a fucking cheeto sommelier? This can't be a real post", "Crumbs just happen. I could eat a freaking sandwhich on a big plate under my chin and still end w some crumbs I can\u2019t see", "I am very careful when I eat cheetos, I rarely get crumbs anywhere, but that orange dust tends to migrate regardless of how fastidious I am about eating carefully. It literally drifts off the chips as they move from bag/bowl to mouth.", "You're acting like you are 12.  \"the bed is comfy\"  \"I suck on the cheetos\"  You're right, you suck!  YTA.", "\"put 100 skill points into the 'eat cheetos' tree is hilariously cringe\"\n\nThis a great sentence! And I agree I want to be satire because I just don't want to believe someone can be this dense.", "Dude, you aren't single, if you don't get rid of single guy habits, you are gonna be single again though.\n\nAlso, it isn't about the chips themselves, eating anything crunch is a bad idea when your so is sleeping next to you. It is rude. Now if you were to go into the kitchen, probably not the same judgements.", "Eating Cheetos in particular in bed is indeed gross. Crunch sound or not Cheetos dust gets on everything unless of course your  licking your fingers the whole time and then you have weird orange spit all over your hands and bed.\n\nWith that said, this seems like disproportionate anger from her and tbh you sound a bit younger to me, which makes me wonder if your missing cues about something else. Is the running cutting into time together? Is the whole process of running, showering, going to the kitchen, eating, playing on your phone actually what\u2019s disturbing her? I\u2019d find it very hard to sleep if that much was going on around me at bed time? Are you doing other things throughout the day that are generally inconsiderate? Because all of that could be building to the Cheetos being the cherry on top of her frustration. \n\nUltimately if you love her, find a different way to unwind and for gods sake have a non defensive conversation with her and really attempt to understand.", "People don\u2019t like people eating in bed. And something like Cheetos is especially gross for bed YTA. Eat your Cheetos in the kitchen.", "OK, troll.", "She probably wants to be comfortable too, sleeping undisturbed.", "Maybe get a new comfy couch.", "You sound like a child. I hope she comes to her senses. You are beyond gross. Do you have any idea the stains you could cause, not to mention the bugs.\n\n\nDisgusting \n\n\nYta and my guess single soon", "Wah, boohoo, too bad so sad, you know what *else* is comfortable? **Not sleeping in the bugs that will inevitably come to eat the crumbs you drop in the bed.**", "That kind of sounds like your problem", "Then it\u2019s obvious your fine being the asshole for your own comfort so delete the post and move on. You got your answer", "Why should anyone care about your comfort when you don\u2019t even care about your gfs?", "You've gotten like 98% replies saying YTA. One person siding with you doesn't vindicate your opinion, and if it does it means you're a shitty partner. Your partner has verbalized that something small you are doing upsets them. Be a fucking adult and change said action.", "Especially when you\u2019re lying on crumbs. Once that happened to me I\u2019m too disgusted to eat in a bed ever since. Plus when you took a shower you just want to fall into clean sheets and pillows", "That\u2019s right it\u2019s not about what op likes it about what ops gf likes", "I mean it's not just about her either. It's not like he went on a Binger. The dude wanted a snack. He should just clean it up after", "And orange powder on his lips and Cheeto breath, I bet. Gross.", "YTA", "And the crinkling wrappers.", "well lucky for you i'm not, I'm 23, otherwise y'all would be shamed for cyberbullying a child, so you're welcome", "It's  secret technique I discovered, If cheetos get wet, they get soft. This eliminates all nose from eating. It also removes all the cheeto dust, puts my tiktoks on mute and beams the sound directly into my head.", "They don't crunch tho", "No, it is about respecting shared space. If OP wants to be unhygienic and sleep in crumbs and have bugs in his bed and cheeto dust on his face in the mornijg, then he shouldn't be sharing a bed w/ someone else b/c that is just gross.", "Kissy kissy! *Puckers in Doritos dust*", "I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re under 25 based on how you\u2019re responding.", "Dude. Chips are crunchy, and what about the bag, crinkling. \n\n\nForget about the sound, what about crumbs, even if we don't think they are there, they could be, and crumbs can lead to ants.", "Yeesh! Lol", "yeah, so?", "And there are Cheetos hands... Because it seems he does not leave the bed to wash them afterwards.", "Because most grown men don\u2019t watch Tik Toks and eat Cheetos in bed next to our partners and if we were to do so, there\u2019d be zero confusion about why they were pissed at us.", "I won't even get into how much of a huge turn off that is. If this guy ever hopes to get any, he needs to ditch the Cheetos in bed.", "Or brush his teeth.", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb"]}
