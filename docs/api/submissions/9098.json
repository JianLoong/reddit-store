They both had walked home from practice in their practice uniforms when it was about 50 degrees outside. I was livid because they were breakup the rules but they also were trying to get away with it since they thought I would be out. \n\nI\u2019ve punished them both by taking away their phones, my daughter has to break up with her boyfriend and obviously basketball season is over. \n\nThey both said they want to go live with their dad (who has been fighting me for custody for 3 years) and called me an asshole\nIn about 20 different ways and said \u201cyou are to give those phones back immediately\u201d I said no and he can be more involved if he cares that much.\n\nTo be fair and objective am I the asshole for having this rule ?", "created_utc": 1675518280, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tgqg9/aita_for_having_a_very_strict_pants_weather_and/", "score": 465, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Being cold doesn't make people automatically sick. Germs do. They walked home in 50 degree weather after getting very warm (presumably) by playing sports. So to punish them for getting cold you decided to remove their social interactions, force a relationship to part (to knowledge) and make them quit sports? \n\nIf they get cold because they are not wearing pants, you can say \"i told you so.\" but at their ages, logical consequences of actions should be more in play than \"mom's arbitrary rule.\" \n\nI know a few grown men who wear shorts until the weather is actually freezing (32/0). It's fun to tell the weather by what you see him wearing. \"Oh it's really cold Mike is in pants today.\"", "YTA: They\u2019re teenagers, not toddlers.

Such a rule made sense when they were young kids (talking toddlers to you elementary school) because you needed to help instill good habits.\n\nBut both of your kids were practicing a sport which would make wearing pants not only uncomfortable at that temperature but also limit their ability to perform. \n\nIn Basketball there is very little down time and during a practice your kids are likely going from drill to drill that is pushing endurance (lots of running and jogging) explosive power (jumps and shoots). The only pants I can see being flexible enough to deal with that would be leggings and I would still be worried about overheating as the practice went on.\n\nYou also state that these shorts were part of practice uniforms, meaning the school or organization requires these to be worn at practice time.\n\nBy grounding your kids, making them quit basketball and making one break up with a significant other you aren't teaching your kids to wear clothes appropriate to the weather, you are teaching them that your rules are the absolutely most important thing and you will ban them from activities, people and life in general if they break them\n\nEdit to add: after reading your comments op I think you need to seek therapy and a science book.

Apologize, seek help and maybe you can salvage this.", "YTA for how you treat your kids. And you're dumber than dirt if you really think wearing shorts in the 50s will cause them to get sick.

Not necessarily, but you're at least using bad information as the reason for enforcing the rule.", "You took away their phones, their extra curricular activities, and made your daughter break up with her boyfriend because they wore shorts. Shorts home from basketball practice, where that is the required uniform. Shorts home from basketball practice when the temperature was 50 degrees. \n\nYes, YTA big time and a very poor, overbearing mother. They're old enough to decide what's comfortable for them and dress themselves. I know people who wear t-shirts and shorts year round, snow or shine.

You are being over controlling.    \n\n\nYour kids sound like they are teenagers, likely in high school.  You allow them to walk home after practice.   It can be difficult to change out of the practice uniform as they are always trying to get the kids out of the school (or other gym) as soon as practice is over.  And because the locker rooms can be crowded, you get pushed around in there, and people spray perfume/cologne.  In other words, it is often much more convenient to change at home.\n\nAdditionally, normal cold weather does not cause illness (unless you have too long of an exposure time, which can cause hypothermia) unless you have certain medical conditions that make you sensitive to cold.    I have walked outside with wet hair in 50 degree weather and never caught a cold.   Viruses and bacteria cause illnesses, not cold weather.  As long as the kids have a jacket and pants  (like jogging pants) available to pull on quickly if they feel cold, then it should be fine.\n\nYour children were likely very warm from their practice.  Thus, putting on pants would have made them feel hot.  Additionally, younger people don't feel as cold as adults do.  I will wear pants when my college age daughter feels comfortable in shorts.  And people experience temperature very differently, as I don't really own a winter jacket, although others do in my community.  I will go out in a light sweater on cold days.  \n\nAdd in that you can have a low temp of 40 degrees but it will be 79 degrees during the day.  Using your rule, even though it was warm outside, it was still mandatory pants weather.\n\nYTA because you went too far.  You should have opened up a discussion as to why they were wearing their practice uniforms home.

Or you may have discovered (if they do have easy to pull on pants) that they were feeling hot and wearing more clothing would have made them miserable.\n\nInstead, you went ballistic.

I think you may be parenting from fear, which again, I get, but you need to pivot or you risk losing the relationship with your kids. \n\nI recommend learning about natural consequences. The natural consequence for wearing too little clothing in the winter is being cold. If they tell you that they aren\u2019t cold, believe them, because hormonal development does crazy things and seems to make teenagers and perimenopausal people impervious to cold. \n\nAgain, cold weather does not cause illness, pathogens do. It\u2019s a hard misconception to let go of, especially when you\u2019re coming from a place of fear, but it is not based in fact. \n\nTaking away their support system (phones/boyfriend/team sports) is not a natural consequence, and it\u2019s really on the cruel side of the spectrum of care.

Again, I think this comes from a place of fear, but that doesn\u2019t excuse it. \n\nApologize to your kids and make it right. Allow them to choose their clothing and teach them to trust their instincts through trial and error. Even if they were to get sick, which again isn\u2019t from being cold, they sound old enough to stay home so you wouldn\u2019t miss work. \n\nIf you can, I think you would benefit I from therapy, but if not, the library has resources on parenting and resolving your own trauma.

Aren't they better judges of their personal comfort than you are?\n\nAlso, even if this rule was logical (which it is not), enforcing because they didn't change after basketball practice makes no sense--that's not deliberately disobeying.  That's just maybe being lazy about changing from basketball uniform to normal clothes before walking home.\n\nAnd even if the rule made sense, and even if it made sense to react to accidentally breaking the rules, your reaction is way over the top and seems like a desire to show you are in charge and have the power rather than a desire to teach your kids to dress correctly for the weather.\n\nThese kids will move out of your life as soon as they can.", "YTA, people don\u2019t get sick for what they wear.

Because the moment these kids can move out and become financially independent, you will never get to see or speak to them again. But that\u2019s ok, because you can be smug in the knowledge that you saved them from the horrors of 63 degree weather in shorts.  \n\nI frequently have to fight with my 6 and 3 year olds to wear seasonally appropriate clothes. By which I mean not wearing shorts and t-shirts in single digit weather. And even that is just because I don\u2019t want to have to deal with the frustration of them being miserably hot or cold and then whining about it. Most of the time when they won\u2019t listen I just tell them to go outside for five minutes dressed as they want and they come back and admit they should change.  \n\nOne of the hardest things about being a parent is knowing your kid is making a mistake when you know better. But most of the time you have to let them make their own mistakes and learn from them. Your kids are old enough to make their own mistakes. If walking home in shorts in 50 degree weather actually did make you sick (it doesn\u2019t, you\u2019re still dead wrong about this) then let them get sick and learn not to do it next time.  \n\nBut instead you refuse to believe you\u2019re wrong, your punishments are MASSIVELY disproportionate even if you were right (you\u2019re not), and you\u2019re just an abusive parent. \n\nYTA.

This is also very easily available information so you can\u2019t even play dumb to it. If you can write a Reddit post, you can do a Dr. Google search.  Although I doubt you actually want to know you\u2019re wrong.  If they\u2019re old enough to be walking home from practice alone, they\u2019re likely old enough to police their own clothing needs.  And if they have a change of clothes with them then they can always just put pants over their shorts if they get cold.  The absolute gaps in logic here are mind boggling.

This isn't actually true though, bacteria and viruses cause illness, not cold. Even though your kids were wearing shorts, they probably weren't even cold since they'd just been sweating playing basketball. Maybe it's just cuz I'm from New England, but 50 degrees is like, walk outside in shorts and a t-shirt with a flannel around my waist type weather.\n\nNot only does your rule seem unreasonable, so does your punishment.

By preventing you kids from playing basketball, they wouldn't be able to see their friends or exercise, both of which are very important for a teenager's social and physical growth. \n\nYou need to ask yourself if this is the hill to die on.
