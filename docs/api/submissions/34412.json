I wasn't able to be adopted right away because I had some health problems, and ended up being placed in a temporary group home until I was three and able to properly be thrown into the system. I've bounced around from one family to another since then. I was almost adopted once, but that fell through and I was moved again. I've been out of the system and on my own for a few years now. I know I'm lucky compared to a lot of foster kids. I got a part time job at 17 and was able to save enough that I didn't end up on the streets when the time came and I aged out. I lived out of a cheap, shitty motel for a while, but this past year I got a better, full time job and finally got my first apartment. It's not amazing, but it's mine. I feel like I'm really starting to get my life together. But then I got a call. \n\nThe call was from a private investigator who was looking for me on behalf of my birth mother. He asked a bunch of questions and everything lined up with my story. In his words, my mother had been looking for me for several years, but since I was moved around so much it was hard to find me. She wanted to meet me. I didn't know what to say. It still doesn't feel real sometimes. But, here's where I might be the asshole. I told him no. I didn't want to see her. I had a lot of emotions going through my mind, not the least of which was anger. I told him I wouldn't meet the woman that abandoned me. That she made a choice and doesn't get to just take it back. He seemed to understand I was upset and gave me a number to contact him if I changed my mind. \n\nSome of my friends I told this to think I'm being too harsh. That if nothing else I should hear her out for my own closure, but I just can't do it. Maybe she did have a reason for why she left me, but I don't think I want to know it. For now, I just want to focus on me. Others agree that I have no obligation to meet her, and shouldn't force myself for someone I don't even know. It's been about a month and a half since that call. I'm still not sure if I made the right choice or not.\n\nShould I have agreed to meet my mother?

She's not a baby in a hospital; you don't need to consider her feelings here. Remove her from the equation and decide what would best support you. In your shoes, I'd probably meet her, but also make sure she did not know too much about where I work, live etc so that I could nope out at any stage. There's no way for you to be the A H here.", "NTA. This is a highly personal decision, your friends have no right to say you are being harsh they have no idea what it feels like and what you\u2019ve been through.\nYou do what you feel is right for you, it\u2019s only been a month and a half which isn\u2019t that long to process it, you still have the number to contact you can always make contact at a later date if you want to.", "NTA, I don\u2019t think you would ever be the AH in this situation.\n\nShe abandoned YOU. It\u2019s not up to your bio mom when to reconnect. That choice is yours & yours alone. \n\nYour friends are right that it would bring you closure but it would also open a new box of emotions. Ask the PI for her contact information and that you would decide when and if the time is right.\n\nI highly recommend seeing a therapist beforehand so you can be at the best place(mentally) if you ever decide to meet her.", "NTA. Your birth mother may have had a very good reason for leaving you, but you\u2019ve had an extremely difficult life because of it. It\u2019s not your responsibility to address her regrets or emotions. I don\u2019t think anything she could say would really give you \u201cclosure\u201d and it could open you up to her continually pursuing you for a relationship.\n\nThink about it and hang onto the PI\u2019s number. Meeting her isn\u2019t your only option; perhaps this woman could send you a letter through the PI or you could arrange a call that lets you block your number. This decision is wholly yours and you should only do what you feel comfortable doing.\n\n(Since you had health problems, depending on what they were/are, it might be worth requesting family heath information from her. That too is a very personal choice, but something to consider.)", " NTA. You\u2019re amazing and you have your shit together and the last thing you need right now is complications.", " Nah.\n\nI\u2019m an adoptee (not former foster youth), and not in reunion. \n\nAre you in any therapy that specializes in adoption? \nReunions can be very difficult to navigate and it can bring up lots of emotions that need to be processed. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to meet her. \n\nIf you feel comfortable, you can ask the PI for his email/phone number so that you have it in case in the future, you do change your mind. \n\nPlease just take care of yourself, your feelings are 100% valid, and you don\u2019t have to meet anyone unless it is your choice to do so. \n\nSending hugs OP!", "NAH.  You and you alone decide if you want to know your origins and meet your biological family.  There is no right or wrong answer; even if you change your mind.  You do what\u2019s right for you.\n\nI would like to point out that you don\u2019t know the story behind your birth.  Perhaps your mother was a 14 yr old incest victim brutalized by her father who made her abandon you to try to hide his crimes.  You don\u2019t know your full story and thus you don\u2019t know why she abandoned you or if she even had a choice in the matter.  For that reason I am not saying N\\_T\\_A as that verdict implies your bio mom is TA.\n\nMy only advice is hold on to the number.  You are already starting to second guessing your decision after 6 weeks and who knows how you\u2019ll feel in a few more weeks or years time.  By all means shut the door if it brings you peace but don\u2019t brick it over permanently eliminating your future self\u2019s choice.  If for no other reason keep the number as you may need your familial medical history at some point.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, you sound like a strong and amazing person.  You\u2019re only 22 and you\u2019ve dealt with and overcome more than most of us do in a lifetime.", "Your biological mother might have had a good reason to abandon you.

What an achievement. \n\nSecondly, this is a highly personal choice. If you don\u2019t want to meet her there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. If you feel peace with that decision that is all that matters!", "NTA. The ones who said you were \"too harsh\" have no business commenting. With that out of the way, it's not a matter of binary do or don't until you sort out want you want. There isn't a wrong answer between them. You'll only feel regret if you don't make it a point to understand what you want and act in line wit that.\n\nIf you have unanswered questions, want perspective, answers or closure, it's not wrong to choose to meet her.\n\nIf you have no interest in that and simply want to move on with your life, it's not wrong to let it lie and do just that.\n\nI would still tell you, you don't have any guarantees the PI won't simply pass that information onto her regardless, so whatever you want, be prepared for the possibility she may approach you at some point, regardless of what you've already told him and he seemingly agreed to.", "NAH.  You don't have to meet your biological mother if you don't want to, that's your choice, so certainly not an asshole at all there.  Your anger is absolutely understandable.\n\nHowever, I would contact that PI and possibly a social worker (I'm not sure how this would work exactly), because it might be worth having a mediator to get some medical history from your biological mother.  She does owe you that at a minimum and it's important to have some idea of any relevant medical history for your own safety and well being.", "NTA - this is totally up to you.  You should hold onto that guys card in case you do decide to change your mind.  You have to do what you think is best for you - it could turn into something really healthy but it could also be the complete opposite of healthy.  I wish you the best of luck in life and that you make the best decision for yourself.", "NTA. This is a very personal decision, so no right or wrong. That said, I would have asked for her contact info in case you reconsider\u2026 it could happen.", "NTA. Absolutely not.  This was a massive, emotional sledgehammer of news to be dumped on you, just as you were beginning to feel that you had created a safe, stable, successful life for yourself. I can\u2019t imagine how it must have made you feel. Ignore your friends, this is your decision, about your life, and only you can make it.  The only reason that you MAY wish to consider is that given you mentioned some health issues at birth, then any medical info you get could be helpful in years to come.\nCongratulations, though, from an internet stranger, on navigating a difficult start in life so successfully. Keep being proud of what you\u2019ve accomplished- you\u2019ve done it by yourself, for yourself.", "NTA\n\nOther people have absolutely no idea what your life was like. I can empathize how rough you had it but I don\u2019t think anyone who hasn\u2019t been through it can give you advice on how you should feel. \n\nDo whatever you feel is best for you.", "NTA at all. Firstly, I'm so sorry that you're going through this. I can only imagine that it's a whirlwind of emotions to process. Processing other's emotions about your decision is the last thing you should have to do.  \n\n\nNow, this was just dumped on your lap! You didn't seek her out - you were just out there living your life and this found its way to you. It's wholly understandable that, if for no other reason, you'd say no just out of pure shock/needing to process it all. But you also are relaying some pretty heavy thoughts and emotions about her/her reaching out. Those feelings are valid simply because you're feeling them. You're protecting yourself.   \n\n\nYou have the right to never meet her, you have the right to change your mind one day if you so choose. In any scenario, you couldn't possibly be the asshole for how you feel or whether you choose contact/no contact. And, again, I'm so sorry you're even having to deal with other's judgement regarding your decision.", "NTA. A life in foster care sucks big ones.  I can't really blame you for saying no.  Think about it for a while.  Take all the time you need.  Your mother made you wait 18 years.  If you decide to meet her,  go for it.  If you decide not to,  that's your decision.  She'll have to live with it.  Good luck.", "NTA - do what feels right for you.  Maybe request her contact info and tell the investigator that you will reach out if and when you feel ready, but that further contact would only reduce that probability.", "NTA. you owe her nothing, the only person who\u2019s feelings your obligated to consider an respect are your own. if it feels right for you, independent of her or anyone else, then it is right, an no one has any right to tell you otherwise. you have the dudes contact info incase you change your mind. an i wanna caution that if you fold to peer pressure on contacting her it could end up so much worse, you talking to her before your truly ready, it can build resentment . go at your own pace, you never have to contact her in your life an that\u2019s okay. or you can change your mind, that\u2019s okay to. it\u2019s your life! just make sure whatever you do your doing it for the right reasons, for you!", "Everyone's story is different - some have good, happy endings, others have ugly, horrible endings -- in regards to meeting birth parents.  I'm adopted and found my birth mother.  Mine was a wonderful happy ending, but I know so many that aren't. Personally, I would say go with what your gut is telling you for now. If you are feeling the need to focus on yourself, then do it, and put off the idea of meeting her. It does not make you an AH to say no, and you are not responsible for her feelings about it either.", "NTA\n\nThis is entirely a personal decision. My daughter is adopted.  Abandoned at the hospital, very little data to go on.

Maybe keep her contact info if you change your mind in the future.", "NTA - you have overcome so much difficulty and adversity in your short life, and you've worked hard to make some stability for yourself.

You don't have to make a decision that's going to last the rest of your life. Right now, the answer is \"no\", and you can revisit it at some point in the future if you choose to.

My parents offered to help me locate her if that is something I wanted but I told them no. You're my parents and I don't have any interest in finding or meeting my birth mother. (I will admit to an idle whimsy once in awhile of a detective tracking me down to inform me I inherited a haunted castle.)\n\n\nYou were abandoned at a hospital and had a much harder go from there than I ever did. You have even more reason to not want to meet your birth mother.\n\n\n*\"It's been about a month and a half since that call. I'm still not sure if I made the right choice or not.\"*\n\nIf this is how you are feeling, you should reexamine your thoughts and feelings. Every passing day increases the chance that you won't be able to meet her. No one's time is limitless if you take my meaning. Morally, there isn't a right or wrong answer here. You need to decide what is best for you. If you're having doubts, explore those feelings. What is a worst case scenario here? What will you feel if you change your mind in a year and she's been run down by a bus or something? \n\n\nI wish I could say with confidence 'Do This' or 'Do That' but this is all on your shoulders. My advice, pick the option that will let you sleep at night.", "NTA\u2026 but you might want to think about the fact that this does not have to be a yes or no question, and it doesn\u2019t have to be on her terms.  You could ask that PI for a family medical history without promising to meet and see what you get.  You could also ask to get a rough explanation of how you came to be abandoned and decide after you read it, or he tells you what you want to do.  You can also say no completely for as long as you want and say something else at any time in the future.  \n\nTwo of my sisters gave newborns to other families for adoption and both were contacted by the adult children later and everyone seems glad to be in contact, but both those adoptees were older than you when they chose to seek out their birth moms.  This is so very much your choice and it honestly sounds like at this time, you are making the right choice for you.", "She made her choices, and chose whatever shee thoughts was best then. Maybe what was best for her, or maybe what was best for you.  Those reasons are hers to live with. \n\nYou owe her nothing. You do not exist to make her feel better about her life choices. \n\nIt sounds like you're in a good position now. Maybe one day you will want to contact her and Confront her. Maybe not. \n\nIt is 100% okay for you to decline  meeting or talking to her. Protect your mental wellbeing first and foremost. \n\nLive your best life for you.", "NTA\n\nYour friends are in the wrong and the are TA's here.  These are your feelings and they are very valid.\n\nYou have no obligation to her.  She had an obligation to you but left you at the hospital.  My curiosity would have me wanting to know but that doesn't mean that it has to be by meeting her.  Perhaps the PI could've told you or she could write you a letter that could be passed onto you (and then you could check to see if it was real).  She may have had a very good reason to leave you there but she also might not have.\n\nYou need to do what's best for you and you've had a very hard life because of her choice (unless she didn't have a choice) and you are now an adult that is free to choose what you want.  There literally is no obligation.", "NTA.\n\nI'm adopted, and I have no idea who my birth parents are.  I'd like to find them, though, to let them know I'm ok and to find it what happened.  But that is what *I* want, and I am not you.\n\nYour feelings are completely legitimate.  And I don't blame you for not wanting to meet her.  Your friends are well-intentioned, but they have not lived your life.\n\nThe only other thing I will say is keep that number.  You might change your mind, or you might just want medical history at some point.  But only call if you want to.\n\nAnd good for you for getting your life on track.  Some of it was luck, but a good amount was YOU.", "NTA You\u2019re under no obligation to consider her feelings in this situation. Hang on to the number in case you ever change your mind. \n\nIf you ever do meet her, game out situations before hand, and don\u2019t give her your direct contact information.  Only meet in a place where you can make a quick safe exit if you need to, like in a diner in a crowded area where you can quickly get to a bus or transit or whatever you need. Be prepared to give a firm no and cut contact if she asks for money or a kidney. Plenty of these stories turn out to be about something like that. On the other hand, she could be wracked with guilt and has been saving money for your college all these years. Who knows.", "NTA whatever gives you peace of mind should be done unapologetically", "Whatever choice you make, you are absolutely NTA.   \nThe issue is deciding what you are comfortable with. If you are still doubting yourself after 6 weeks or so I have to wonder if you would be better of allowing the PI to arrange a meeting. I think that maybe right now you're trying to make a decision with too many unknowns.  \nIt's sad that you were abandoned but it was in a hospital, not a dumpster. That should count for something.   \nBottom line, you have to do what feels right for you.  \nCongratulations for getting your life together and moving forward the way you have.  Good luck, regardless of what you decide to do.", "NTA.  It may be hard for others to understand, but if there is nothing for you to gain from this interaction, then skip it.  You don't owe your birth mother any type of closure.  It sounds like you are in a good place now, it is not worth jeopardizing that.  If you are curious,  cool.  If totally not interested that is also understandable.  You are not being harsh at all.", "Adoptee here and NTA. It's a very personal decision that only you can make. Your friends may have good intentions, but they will never understand your experience. You don't owe anyone a reason. \n\nI do recommend seeing a therapist that helps adoptees/foster care children navigate whatever emotions you may have surrounding your abandonment. \n\nI tentatively recommend reaching out to the PI for your family medical history but again, it's your choice.\n\nBut most of all, dear OP, congratulations on your apartment & a space of your own. That's a huge achievement and I hope you're proud.", "NTA All choices in life have consequences, but you might want to find out why she gave you up before you close that door. I doubt she ever thought you'd end up stuck in the system, not every baby gets adopted. But in the end it's up to you what you're comfortable with and if you don't want to she needs to abide by that decision", "Re: \"closure\" as a reason to meet biomom - it sounds like OP has closure already. \n\nOP has no interest in meeting biomom, sounds like OP has no unfinished emotional business relative to wanting to know an origin story. That being the case, closure, for OP, has already occurred.\n\nYou might want to say something like that to anyone who bugs you about needing closure, OP.", "My younger sister was adopted out of foster care. She was an emergency placement infant. Her contact with her birth family has not been worth all the wondering and waiting. It just hasn't. Its been painful and has resulted in additional rejections that have caused my sister great pain. And I only mention it because I just wish people knew that this doesn't always play out like a fairy tale.", "This is a very good answer.", "Or video call to a new email address that you can delete after if you don\u2019t like what she has to say. Video would give you a better read on body language\u2026\n\nNTA regardless, she did what was best for her and I\u2019m sure she thought it would be best for you but clearly it wasn\u2019t. \n\nIs there a therapist you could  reach out to to talk, even for just a couple sessions?", "There is never a good reason to abandon a baby.   If she did not feel ready to parent for whatever reason, she could have made an adoption plan.", "How was it clearly not what was best for OP? It was very difficult and painful for OP, but what if OP's birth mother was a homeless drug addict who was not in a position to safely care for anyone? Or an unmedicated schizophrenic? I don't think it's that easy to declare that foster care is worse than ANY possible family situation (including all forms of abuse, danger, mistreatment, and harm). Doesn't mean that OP's pain is any less real or legitimate.", "I\u2019m an adoptee.\n\nIt sounds like this may have been a safe surrender situation (leaves a baby at the hospital, a safe haven). \n\nWe don\u2019t know of the circumstances, for we all we know, it wasn\u2019t even her choice to relinquish her baby.", "1) Abuse. Couldn't make an adoption plan without the consent of the biological father so had the baby and left it at the hospital to keep it safe.\n2) Homelessness. No prenatal care, no interaction with social workers. Left baby at hospital where if would be safe \n3) Hidden pregnancy due to a extremely religious environment where her life would be at risk if the pregnancy was revealed  either from abuse, homelessness or forced marriage.\n4) Mental illness. People in the middle of mental health episodes do not make the best choices.\n\nThey may not be the best reason but they are all reasons why a scared mother saw leaving her child in hospital was her only safe option.\n\nOP isn't a AH but I can't call her bio mom one without knowing why. NAH.", "We know nothing.   Her mother might have been 12 years old.   Blanket statements like \"never a good reason \" are generally a bad idea.", "When I say \"good reason to abandon you\", what I mean is that it's possible she was not equipped to raise a baby for whatever the reason (finances, abusive household, etc).  I'm not saying she went about giving the baby up the right way, but at the very least, she got it to the hospital instead of leaving the child for dead.  \n\nUltimately, it doesn't matter.  It's not OP's problem anymore.", "There's absolutely good reasons to abandon a baby. Off the top of my head, having a physically abusive boyfriend and/or family with whom you know the kid will never be safe.", "I am an adoptee and a parent by adoption. There is a difference between abandoned and made an adoption plan.", "I\u2019m an adoptee, just wanted to add that not all places require the consent of the biological father to relinquish for adoption. \n\nAlso, cryptic pregnancies do occur.\n\nMost biological parents relinquish due to lack of resources, finances, or support system. \n\nSafe haven laws exist so that people can safely relinquish their baby.", "If she was 12, or 14, a social worker would have been called into the hospital to meet with her, and would have told her her options regarding placing the baby for adoption.      Maybe I should say abandonment is generally a bad idea?  \n\nThere are ways to decide not to parent a baby you birth that help to ensure that the baby has a good life.  Then there is abandonment.", "It sounds like this could\u2019ve been a safe surrender situation.\nHospitals and fire stations are safe haven locations where babies can be dropped off in a safe manner, if the biological parent does not wish to keep them.", "Semantics.\n\nRelinquish for adoption can also technically be seen as abandonment.\n\nSafe haven laws allow for the safe surrender of babies at locations such as hospitals or fire stations."]}
