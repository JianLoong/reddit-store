My sister is 17f, and she has a 1-year-old son with her ex-boyfriend of 4 years who recently broke up with her.\r  \n\r  \nWhen she got pregnant, our parents suggested that she get an abortion (which is accessible in our state) so that she could continue to live a relatively normal life, and made it clear her life would change a lot if she had to deal with a child as well as school, extracurriculars, friends, whatever. She said she understood that, and wanted to continue the pregnancy.\r  \n\r  \nAfter her son was born, it became clear that she wasn't as ready as she claimed to be. While our parents help out when they can, they're both generally busy, and it falls to her to take care of her son a lot of times. The issue is, while she enjoys the more fun parts like playing with her son and taking cute photos with hi,, she always tries pawning stuff like changing diapers onto me. Additionally, she doesn't like to stay home on weekends to take care of her son, and pushes that onto me too. She does this by making plans, not telling me until the last second, then saying the day of that she needs to go out and if I don't watch her son then he'll be alone and unsafe to force me to say yes.\r  \n\r  \nI told her this last Friday, bluntly, that since she's a mother now, she needs to start acting like it and taking care of her own child instead of pushing it onto others. She said that she deserves to have a normal teenage life and that it would make her sad if she had to stay home and take care of her baby while her friends were out having fun. I told her that if she wanted a normal life, she should've had an abortion. She's a mom now, that isn't what's normal for her age, so she won't have a normal life. She can't be a mother and live like her friends that aren't, that's trying to have it both ways.\r  \n\r  \nShe got angry and said that I was being harsh and 'slut shaming' her. My parents took her side, saying I was being too harsh.

You\u2019re not slut shaming her, you\u2019re calling out her poor parenting skills.", "NTA. It\u2019s unfair for her to want to live a \u201cnormal teenage life\u201d while unloading her responsibilities onto you, a fellow teenager. It\u2019s hypocritical. Unfortunately she\u2019s just not mature enough to be a mother yet, but she\u2019s gonna have to learn quickly. Everything you told her is true.", "I'm confused what part of your comments to her was considered \"slut shaming\". It is harsh to tell someone who already has a baby that they should have got an abortion, but the rest of what you said is just the truth. She can't have a normal life now that she is a teen mom. \n\nGoing with NTA because it's a pattern of manipulative behavior on her part, but with the stipulation that it was a harsh comment.", "NTA.  She needed a reality check and needs to refocus her priorities.  It sucks for her but it was her decision to make.  Set your boundaries clearly not only to her but your parents as well.  Your nephew is not your child and you are not an automatic babysitter.", "NTA\n\nYou were just stating the obvious.  If she thinks that's slut shaming then that says more about how she views herself.\n\nWhere's the father in all this?  Surely he should be looking after his kid if the mother can't, not you.", "NTA. That\u2019s not slut shaming, that\u2019s facts.

Posting only to vote - NTA.", ">She said that she deserves to have a normal teenage life  \n\nNo, she doesn't.    She made a choice to have a baby.   In her ignorance she didn't realize that babies take up your entire day and you can't just walk away from them.  \n\nNTA\n\nIt' not up to you to do her dirty work.   Set  some boundaries on how much you will babysit and specific hours you would be available.   She can form her schedule around that.  \n\nWhere does slut shaming cone into this.    Having a child does not make you a slut.", "NTA. You told her the truth. If she wanted a normal life she should have taken the options available to her. She chose her path and your nephew isn't your responsibility. I suggest moving out when you can. Your parents are just going to keep enabling her.", "NTA. You were not slut shaming her but telling her she needs to grow up and take care of her kid instead of pushing her responsibilities onto others.\n\nIf she leaves her child home alone again you might wanna look into calling the police or getting cps involved.", "Nta. She made her bed and can lie in it.", "NTA.

Next times she say she is living and if you don\u2019t watch him he will be left alone simply respond if you find out she did this you would call the cops on her and cps will step in for abandonment then turn and leave the house. \n\nIt is not your job to watch him. He is not your responsibility. Stop letting her guilt and manipulate him.

She has to live with the consequences of her decisions. \n\nBut because you both are so young that I suspect you are not the right messenger to deliver this kind of talk. If there is an older woman\u2014you mother, an aunt, a respected family friend, etc\u2014who might be able to reach her, perhaps you can bring your concerns to that person and have them pass on the message and mentor your sister.", "NTA That's not slut shaming at all.  You told her the blunt truth that she needed to hear.  Next time she tries to dump the baby on you last minute, tell her that you could and will consider calling child services for an abandoned child.  It might be the reality check she needs.  If just threatening doesn't work, you might have to actually call them.  She can't just force someone else to care for her kid because she wants a \"normal\" life again.

Why is all of this childcare falling to you?  Are they okay with the idea of your sister leaving her infant alone in the house while she parties?  It sounds like you said what needed to be said, but your parents are the ones who should be saying it.", "NTA. Normally I\u2019ll jump on slut shaming. But that\u2019s not what you did - you said that she\u2019s responsible for her choices. She is. She\u2019s a parent to her son, and that\u2019s a big responsibility too. Critically, it\u2019s her responsibility, and her parents\u2019 responsibility (until she\u2019s not a minor anymore), not yours. When she says \u201cI\u2019m going out, watch my son or he\u2019ll be unsafe\u201d, you should refuse.", "> and it falls to her to take care of her son a lot of times.\n\nI can't stop laughing at this. \n\nYou deserve to live like a normal teenager/person who isn't the parent of a literal baby. If she wants to threaten you with leaving her baby uncared for, you can inform her that you'll call CPS for abandonment because it turns out that she's responsible for making sure her child is cared for 100% of the time whether she feels like her friends are having more fun or not. \n\nESH because you're enabling her and your parents to fail that baby.", "Actually she gave up the right to have a normal teenage life when she kept the baby.

Worst case, take him down to a safe surrender location. No questions asked.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nIt might be a little cold to tell her she should of had an abortion, but it's kinda the truth due to how her life is rn.\n\nShe made a dumb decision, as teenagers do, but that doesn't excuse her for being somewhat not 100% in the parent mood.\n\nShe's going through a lot and i get why what u said might have hurt her but you didnt even slut shame her.", "NTA. At all. Didn't slut shame at all. She sounds quite spoiled, selfish, and manipulative. I hope you have a place you can go to and stay for a few days. And I wouldn't tell anyone I was going until I was already gone. That might be easier said than done, but you don't owe her anytime, round the clock childcare. I can't help but wonder why your parents would see this happening to you and not step in. I'm so sorry!", "NTA, but you need to call her bluff. Next time she tells you that if you don\u2019t watch the baby he\u2019ll be alone and unsafe, you need to tell her that she can have all the free time she wants when CPS takes the baby because she left him alone and unsafe.", "She was the one slut shaming herself, basically exaggerating and putting words in your mouth. You said yourself she was with the same guy for four years. Generally a slut is a woman who sleeps around a lot.\n\nNTA. Just because you take precautions doesn't mean you're destined to lead a life as if you had been carefree. Actions (and lack of) have consequences, and this is a life lesson she should have already learned.", "NTA.  I\u2019d tell her if she leaves the baby alone, you\u2019ll call CPS.

Tell her and your parents that if she leaves her child unattended that you will call the police and report it as abandonment.", "NTA. I hope your parents are prepared to raise your sister's baby because I have seen this happen many times, and that is ALWAYS the result.", "It\u2019s not your baby. Your parents and sister are parents are doing parentification on you. Your nephew is not your responsibility. \n\nYou\u2019re NOT slut shaming her. Just pointing the truth. Her baby, her nights at home. She had options. She gave up her teenage years when she decide to be an adult and have a child.\n\nHonestly OP, get out if you can. If not, make plans for every weekend. Get a job. Go work on the weekends. Anything to disabuse them of this notion that you\u2019re responsible for your sister\u2019s child. Because it\u2019s not yours.\n\nNTA. But sister and parents, on the other hand\u2026.", "NTA", "\"She said that she deserves to have a normal teenage life and that it would make her sad if she had to stay home and take care of her baby while her friends were out having fun.\"\n\nAnd you don't deserve to be a teenager? You didn't have this kid. Why is it on you to provide childcare?\n\nNTA.", "ESH\n\n* Theres being honest in your own opinion, then there is YOU, being a dick.\n* She played grown up games and got a grown up prize.\n* Not slut shaming though", "I was originally going to say NTA. Until I read this:\n\n\"...she doesn't like to stay home on weekends to take care of her son, and pushes that onto me too. She does this by making plans, not telling me until the last second, then saying the day of that she needs to go out and if I don't watch her son then he'll be alone and unsafe to force me to say yes.\"\n\nDude, no one is forcing you to say yes. You are doing that. And by doing so, you are the one enabling her behavior.\n\nESH. She obviously is a shitty parent, and that behavior is being enabled by you.", "ESH, so you told her that she should have killed your nephew instead? Stone cold.", "Yep, call CPS if she tries to leave her kid alone. You will come out on top in the long run. This baby doesn't deserve to have a parent that is still focused on being a teenager rather than taking care of the life she brought into this world.", ">I\u2019d refuse to help out at this point completely and if she leaves her child alone, fine, you\u2019ll just call CPS.\n\nHonestly, that's the best solution here.", "If the sister didn't want to have an abortion, she sould have given the child up if she wants to be a childless young adult.", ">It really makes me sad when people choose to become parents, and then decide to live as if they aren't \ud83d\ude14\n\nSame, it's ridiculous", "Exactly, I feel like she's trying to weaponize the term slut shaming to discredit what I think is a valid point.", "The fact she claims he is slutt shaming her kinda seems like sis is out there trying to get pregnant again unless op left some major part out cause I'm not seeing anything to to with shaming her except as a parent", ">but she\u2019s gonna have to learn quickly\n\nHonestly, I'm doubtful that she will", "I came here to say this. OP, you deserve to live a normal teenage life. It\u2019s kind to help her occasionally, because parenting is hard no matter how old someone is, but this is her kid, not yours. She needs to step up. NTA\n\nAlso, where\u2019s the father in this? Does he ever care for his child? Seems like they could trade off weekend days so each of them gets one night out.", "I think she was just trying to call it slut shaming to discredit me rather than it actually being slut shaming.", "Thank you for the advice", "He didn't want to keep the child to begin with and eventually broke up with her over it", "Exactly", "Fair enough lol", ">I suggest moving out when you can\n\nGood idea", ">If she leaves her child home alone again you might wanna look into calling the police or getting cps involved.\n\nYeah that's a good idea", "Exactly", "Apparently she thought her life wouldn't change in any negative way and that she'd just be able to take pictures of the kid for likes on social media.", "That's a good idea, thank you", "Fair enough", "???", "I don't think she's willing to do that", "This. Just because he broke up with her doesnt mean hes off the hook either. If he cant be trusted with an infant he needs to at least pay child support so it covers some child care.", "I'd also like to know how old the dad is. It could have been a very predatory situation and not entirely the sisters fault. It doesn't mean the sister has to do childcare for her but she could be more sympathetic to a literal child", "Honestly curious, why do you think he was being a dick?  It didn\u2019t seem like he said anything that was off base from my perspective.\n\nIt looks like he just pointed out the facts and not even in a rude way but maybe I am missing something.", "Thank you for the advice", "If you\u2019re still living with your parents, I\u2019d also include them in this. Make it very clear she is abandoning her child with you and if it ever happens again you will call CPS\n\nI don\u2019t want them to threaten to kick you out if you go this route.", "She is.  Your comment wasn\u2019t derogatory about her sex life, you pointed out that she decided to become a parent so it\u2019s her responsibility to behave like one. \n\nYour sister is way out of line dropping her kid on anyone at the last minute unless it\u2019s the child\u2019s father.", "Just tell her you\u2019re not calling her a whore you\u2019re saying she is a horrible parent", "Parenting is hard. Really effing hard. \n\nSometimes I miss my old life so much. To be free and go where I want when I want. To go out with my friends with minimal planning and just have fun. \n\nBut I chose to be a parent. As did your sister. \n\nI never shaft my kids off to someone else. It\u2019s been MONTHS since husband and I have been on a date (and the one before that was well over a year ago)  and I can\u2019t remember the last time I managed a girls night. \n\n\nAbsolutely NTA. \n\nYour sister chose to carry a pregnancy to term when there were options available to her. \n\n\nyou could say to her\n- I love my nephew but I\u2019m not his parent. You are. I **AM** going out at x time and if you\u2019re not here I\u2019ll be calling cps\n\n\nAny chance you\u2019re leaving home soon for uni?", "Yeah, it's not slut shaming. It's not the behavior you have a problem with, it's the fact that she's dumping her responsibilities on you to engage in those. \n\nIf she was doing the exact same behavior to go to night classes, or a job, or to volunteer, it would still be a problem.", "Did she take him to court to establish a parenting plan? He's gotta step up or forfeit his rights at the very least.", "What about his parents, or are they sticking their heads in the sand as well?", "Better yet, talk to your friends parents, get a job if you don't already have one, and offer rent until you can get your own place.", "There may come a time when she will be willing to do an open adoption. She can still visit with her child, but the adoptive parents do all the responsibilities.", "Having CPS called on you is a really terrifying thing", "Exactly, yeah", "That's not their kid either.  It's the mom's responsibility, unless she wants to give it up for adoption.", "Thank you for the advice. I'm leaving for college in a few months anyhow so I think that will do the trick", "Open adoption isn't enforceable in most states in the US. Sounds like adoption might be the best option for this situation anyway.", "He still is obligated to pay child support and if hes underage and doesnt have a job then his parents have to pay child support as well. I had a friend like this who got his gf pregnant at 16 and his parents had to pay until he got a job", "Leaving for college is even better because nobody can say you \"abandoned\" her, which you wouldn't be doing anyway, but somebody would certainly say it and that would cause family problems.\n\nJust make sure you actually do leave for college and don't let anyone persuade you to stay home \"for the baby's sake.\" Not you circus, not your monkeys.", "Best of luck to you OP!!", "Nor should they be. Like any parents, adoptive parents have the right to protect their children from unsafe influences. But the benefits of open adoption are well documented. And the OP did not give anyone any reason to think she is a drug addict, violent, has legal problems, etc... Your statement is highly prejudicial and deceptive but is technically correct. I disagree with the way you said it bc you make it sound like they are all scams.", "Which is wrong, imo."]}
