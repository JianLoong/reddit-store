And if there is interest on her student loans it is prudent to pay it off as fast as you can. But again I don't know what your situation is like or how much debt she actually has.

Don't do it.", "NTA, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't.\n\nIt wouldn't be that hard to figure out what paying off the loan now would save you in the long term. If it were me, I'd check into this, pay off her loan if it made sense, but with the stipulation that we build towards buying a car as the next big financial expense, and she can use some of the money she would've been paying against her student loan to fund savings for that, along with yourself.\n\nEnd of the day she is your wife, and your long term goals hopefully match yours.

If you intend to keep the bank accounts  apart for life , other than a joint household account,  then don't help pay her loans.

Marriage is essentially a contract, and when you two chose to have two separate bank accounts and one joint account (presumably for joint expenditures), you two chose to have separate finances.

Plus everyone else in the comment section have a good point about you working hard to pay off your loans. Personally, at whatever point I get married, my plan is to have one joint account we share, and not worry about who has more money since all of the money belongs to both of us. But that is up to me to decide with my future wife, just as you two chose to have mostly separate finances.", "NTA for wanting the car but you do need to also help your wife pay off her loans.

Because when my mother said yes to my dad, she helped him with a ton of loans he had from a divorce. They were a team and the sooner he was debt-free, the sooner they could get a nice house and all of the good stuff. You need to get over your ego, get over yourself and actually start to bahave like a husband and think about your future together.

It may genuinely make better since to spend that money on a car. (I personally would always prioritize getting out of debt but that\u2019s not your question).

It also includes maintenance, insurance, gas, and often parking. And if you don't purchase the car outright, there are regular car loan payments to be made as well. Is it the same where you are?
