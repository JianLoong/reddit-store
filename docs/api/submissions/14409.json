I\u2019ve been in therapy since I  was 11, I worked out a lot of my issues about my dad. My mother remarried when I was 7, I have a stepdad and 2 brothers I love very much. I am applying to colleges, an feel happier then I ever have.\n3 weeks ago I got a call from my dad, he told me he was engaged, he was getting married in the fall, he wanted me to come to a reunion so they can get to know each other\u2019s family, an I can get to know my new siblings. He said she wanted to meet his kids before they got married.\n(My father has 3 kids. Me, my brother and sister. I have a relationship with my sister, but we\u2019re not close bc she lives far away.)\n\nI hung up, I couldn\u2019t deal with it I was emotional, an I bawled my eyes out. The next day I called my dad, I told him I had no interest in meeting his new family, that he was cruel for abandoning an 8 year old, even more cruel for reaching out bc he was forced to do so, I already had a family I was happy an secure with an I had no interest in him being in my life bc he was no longer my dad, and to not contact me.\n\nI called my sister to ask if he reached out to her, he did, an she was going to go. I told her the conversation, she said what I said was appropriate bc it was true but I could\u2019ve been nicer about it. \nI was a bit sad, but my family was there to comfort me. \nMy sister sent me a link to a FB post that my new stepmother had shared, saying she couldn\u2019t believe that \u201cA perfect man could have such terrible children\u201d\nMy sister told me she was not going to go to the reunion bc she agreed she didn\u2019t want to meet this woman after what she said about us. \n\nI thought that would be the end of it an though that post upset me, I tried to let it go, but I started getting calls from my fathers side of the family, even my brother, telling me I was a bitch, an asshole for ruining the reunion by telling my dad he wasn\u2019t my dad. They told me that he canceled the whole thing an he was questioning whether he should get married at all. They told me I could\u2019ve reached out, it wasn\u2019t fair they were being the ones blamed for the falling out.\nI have since blocked them, I did see a post on FB saying my dad postponed his wedding.  But now I can\u2019t stop thinking about what they said. I mean, yes, I could\u2019ve reached out but I feel that\u2019s not fair bc I was 8 I shouldn\u2019t have to be the one that makes amends.\n\nI know that I was harsh an could\u2019ve gone about telling him I didn\u2019t want him in my life a nicer way, but I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong, maybe that\u2019s bc everybody around me is taking my side. I\u2019ve had multiple people tell me I\u2019m an asshole, I feel guilty an I want an outside perspective.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I just want to add some stuff. My sister is 23, my brother is 28. my mother had nothing to do with my family cutting me out. 2 years ago, I called my dad under the advice of my therapist, when he answered, I started crying and he didn\u2019t say anything he just hung up on me, I think that\u2019s when I really moved on from my dad.", "created_utc": 1681082976, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gzpfc/aita_for_telling_my_dad_i_have_no_interest_in/", "score": 555, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is *all* on your father. He abandoned you and you owe him NOTHING.", "NTA. Not even a tiny bit. You told him the truth, if he can\u2019t handle that, it\u2019s not your problem.  Ignore anyone who tries to make you feel bad for telling the truth. And, your \u201cdad\u201d is having a pity party and trying to guilt trip you and your siblings, if he postponed the wedding, it\u2019s either because he\u2019s trying to make you look bad OR his fianc\u00e9 started to see his true colours and dumped him. NONE OF IT IS YOUR FAULT!!!!!", "NTA.\n\nYou are not even legally an adult yet now, let alone when he left. It should never be the burden of the children to reach out.", "NTA, and his side of the family sounds as toxic as he is. Say good riddance and be happy to return to the norm of not dealing with him.", "NTA at all. It was NOT your responsibility to reach out to him, especially as a child that he left behind and couldn't be bothered with. Good for you for standing up for yourself. You have every right to not want to be involved with him and his new family.", ">but I could\u2019ve been nicer about it.\n\nNTA You're not responsible for what your parents do when you're 8 years old and no amount of kindness is necessary to a parent who chose to abandon you. \n\nNiceties be damned. The emotional scarring he caused will follow you your entire life. He doesn't deserve kindness.", "NTA. NTA. NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe abandoned you. He deserves nothing", "NTA You have the right to feel your feelings. He is contacting you not about your needs and wants, but his desire for closure before he officially starts a new family. It is understandable for him to want to inform you before it happens and maybe even want you there, but he also should have been fully prepared that you would decline. \n\nThis is a big moment in his life. He has not made you a part of that. For him to and his girlfriend to expect you to be onboard without reservations is somewhere from naive to completely insensitive. \n\nBest of luck in college.", "NTA, and I hope you can get back into therapy to work through this latest development. \n\nYou're his child. The responsibility to reach out and maintain the relationship was on him, and frankly, it sounds like your whole paternal family is made up of awful people if they ALL abandoned you. Now, nine years later, he wants you to show up and play happy family on command to impress his fiancee? That's insane. And you're not at all wrong that he's not your dad anymore, since he up and abandoned you. \n\nIf your brother is your mom's child, she needs to intervene in that relationship on your behalf. If not, he may need to be blocked like all the rest of these lunatics.", "YOU WERE EIGHT! \n\nThis is not your fault. None of this is your fault. It was never your fault. Your response to your father should have been expected. It was never your responsibility to reach out. Just, no to all of this. \n\nPlease stop beating yourself up over this. Please stop looking for anything related on social media. Block people. Give yourself grace and try to get back to the well adjusted life you had before some asshole created this shitshow. JFC. Not your circus, not your monkeys. NTA", "So so SO NTA! You are still a child and you were a young child when your Dad noped out like a coward. Most families I know keep in touch with their grandkids or niblings if the parent on their side disappears. Most families tend to be embarrassed to have a family member do that. It says a lot about his family that not only did they not keep in contact with you but blame a literal CHILD for not doing what was always their responsibility.\n\nYour response was completely understandable and was the consequence of your father\u2019s actions. Please take care of yourself and focus your attention on the family that supports and deserves you", "NTA - as a parent I can\u2019t imagine not being part of my child\u2019s life. For him and his family to bail on you for such a significant part of your life in inexcusable. Maybe you could of put more gently but then again that burden is not on you.", "NTA. Apart from your siblings, your father\u2019s side of the family sound like AWFUL people. He abandons you and they all cut contact? What the hell? If they were decent people it would be the other way around and they would cut him off and support you.\n\nAs far as stepmother\u2019s \u201cperfect man\u201d, how stupid is she? The fact that his kid wants nothing to do with him should be a major red flag. Instead of blaming you she ought to be asking why you want nothing to do with him.", "NTA! Please don't buy into their bullshit. I am sorry but you don't just have all family cut ties because you left your child. All of your dad's family needs to stay away from you. I am so sorry you are having to deal with this. Please forget everything they said. Even what your sister said about being nicer. Your \"dad\" lost his rights to ask you for anything and so did his family.", "NTA it sounds like your father only reached out because his fiancee asked him to. I would start blocking him and his family,  the fact that the first contact they've had with you in 8 years is to call you names and be mean is insane. They need to be in your rearview. And why is your mother allowing this??", "NTA. Those adults should have reached out to you instead of putting the responsibility on a child. If you are certain that your mom didn't forbid/block the contact, then don't feel bad.\n\nFiance sounds like she's looking for an excuse to call off the wedding. Your dad didn't raise you because he wasn't around. Your dad cancelling the reunion because of just one person makes him (again) immature and irresponsible.\n\nDon't let them put all of this on you. None of it is your fault.", "NTA! \n\nYour father doesn\u2019t know who you are and hasn\u2019t made any effort to form a relationship with you until now. It seems he wants to meet for his own selfish reasons too. It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s remorseful or wants to mend the relationship. He wants you to be at this \u201creunion\u201d for his own selfish needs. \n\nYou have done a lot of work on yourself through therapy and you have your own family that does not include him. It\u2019s good that you put down those boundaries. The fact that he doesn\u2019t respect them, or have any empathy for how you feel towards him confirms that he is only thinking of himself. \n\nKeep focusing on yourself and your real family. Best of luck for college!", "NTA\n\nHe was a perfect man to his wife & his new children but not to yall. His family reaching out now is mind boggling! Your dad & his whole family need to be cut off.", "I'm so sorry this person has thrown you into turmoil. Nta. How can someone blame a kid for not maintaining the relationship. None of the people harassing you know your side of the story. I would not let these people back in your life.", "NTA. Ask the stepmonster where he's been for the last nine years. Him being so perfect and all.", "NTA.  My father abandoned us when I was 2 years old (I'm F54 now).  I would never, ever feel I owe him anything.  I stopped having any familial duty to him the minute he left.  You don't have to be nice to him.  You don't even have to acknowledge his existence.  He left, not you.  You haven't done anything wrong.  The fact that his family is on his side is just disgusting.  \n\nGood luck, sweetie.  You'll be just fine.", "NTA you need to block all these folk harassing you ASAP!

After the wedding, he'd be NC again.\n\nYou would have gotten your hopes up and he would fail every time.  Your poor brother seems very optimisitc, thinking this 'reunion' was going to be great.

After that we never talked again until I was around 12 and he called me to tell me happy birthday, he called me one more time the same year to say merry Christmas, after that, I didn\u2019t hear from him again until three weeks ago when he called me.", "Thank you so much! I also really appreciate your advice, I got similar advice from my Therapist as well.
