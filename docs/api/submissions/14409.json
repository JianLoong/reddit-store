I\u2019ve been in therapy since I  was 11, I worked out a lot of my issues about my dad. My mother remarried when I was 7, I have a stepdad and 2 brothers I love very much. I am applying to colleges, an feel happier then I ever have.\n3 weeks ago I got a call from my dad, he told me he was engaged, he was getting married in the fall, he wanted me to come to a reunion so they can get to know each other\u2019s family, an I can get to know my new siblings. He said she wanted to meet his kids before they got married.\n(My father has 3 kids. Me, my brother and sister. I have a relationship with my sister, but we\u2019re not close bc she lives far away.)\n\nI hung up, I couldn\u2019t deal with it I was emotional, an I bawled my eyes out. The next day I called my dad, I told him I had no interest in meeting his new family, that he was cruel for abandoning an 8 year old, even more cruel for reaching out bc he was forced to do so, I already had a family I was happy an secure with an I had no interest in him being in my life bc he was no longer my dad, and to not contact me.\n\nI called my sister to ask if he reached out to her, he did, an she was going to go. I told her the conversation, she said what I said was appropriate bc it was true but I could\u2019ve been nicer about it. \nI was a bit sad, but my family was there to comfort me. \nMy sister sent me a link to a FB post that my new stepmother had shared, saying she couldn\u2019t believe that \u201cA perfect man could have such terrible children\u201d\nMy sister told me she was not going to go to the reunion bc she agreed she didn\u2019t want to meet this woman after what she said about us. \n\nI thought that would be the end of it an though that post upset me, I tried to let it go, but I started getting calls from my fathers side of the family, even my brother, telling me I was a bitch, an asshole for ruining the reunion by telling my dad he wasn\u2019t my dad. They told me that he canceled the whole thing an he was questioning whether he should get married at all. They told me I could\u2019ve reached out, it wasn\u2019t fair they were being the ones blamed for the falling out.\nI have since blocked them, I did see a post on FB saying my dad postponed his wedding.  But now I can\u2019t stop thinking about what they said. I mean, yes, I could\u2019ve reached out but I feel that\u2019s not fair bc I was 8 I shouldn\u2019t have to be the one that makes amends.\n\nI know that I was harsh an could\u2019ve gone about telling him I didn\u2019t want him in my life a nicer way, but I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong, maybe that\u2019s bc everybody around me is taking my side. I\u2019ve had multiple people tell me I\u2019m an asshole, I feel guilty an I want an outside perspective.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I just want to add some stuff. My sister is 23, my brother is 28. my mother had nothing to do with my family cutting me out. 2 years ago, I called my dad under the advice of my therapist, when he answered, I started crying and he didn\u2019t say anything he just hung up on me, I think that\u2019s when I really moved on from my dad.", "created_utc": 1681082976, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gzpfc/aita_for_telling_my_dad_i_have_no_interest_in/", "score": 992, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NONE OF IT IS YOUR FAULT!!!!!", "NTA.\n\nYou are not even legally an adult yet now, let alone when he left. It should never be the burden of the children to reach out.", "NTA, and his side of the family sounds as toxic as he is. Say good riddance and be happy to return to the norm of not dealing with him.", "NTA at all. It was NOT your responsibility to reach out to him, especially as a child that he left behind and couldn't be bothered with. Good for you for standing up for yourself. You have every right to not want to be involved with him and his new family.", ">but I could\u2019ve been nicer about it.\n\nNTA You're not responsible for what your parents do when you're 8 years old and no amount of kindness is necessary to a parent who chose to abandon you. \n\nNiceties be damned. The emotional scarring he caused will follow you your entire life. He doesn't deserve kindness.", "NTA. NTA. NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe abandoned you. He deserves nothing", "NTA You have the right to feel your feelings. He is contacting you not about your needs and wants, but his desire for closure before he officially starts a new family. It is understandable for him to want to inform you before it happens and maybe even want you there, but he also should have been fully prepared that you would decline. \n\nThis is a big moment in his life. He has not made you a part of that. For him to and his girlfriend to expect you to be onboard without reservations is somewhere from naive to completely insensitive. \n\nBest of luck in college.", "NTA, and I hope you can get back into therapy to work through this latest development. \n\nYou're his child. The responsibility to reach out and maintain the relationship was on him, and frankly, it sounds like your whole paternal family is made up of awful people if they ALL abandoned you. Now, nine years later, he wants you to show up and play happy family on command to impress his fiancee? That's insane. And you're not at all wrong that he's not your dad anymore, since he up and abandoned you. \n\nIf your brother is your mom's child, she needs to intervene in that relationship on your behalf.

Not your circus, not your monkeys. NTA", "So so SO NTA! You are still a child and you were a young child when your Dad noped out like a coward. Most families I know keep in touch with their grandkids or niblings if the parent on their side disappears. Most families tend to be embarrassed to have a family member do that. It says a lot about his family that not only did they not keep in contact with you but blame a literal CHILD for not doing what was always their responsibility.\n\nYour response was completely understandable and was the consequence of your father\u2019s actions. Please take care of yourself and focus your attention on the family that supports and deserves you", "NTA - as a parent I can\u2019t imagine not being part of my child\u2019s life. For him and his family to bail on you for such a significant part of your life in inexcusable. Maybe you could of put more gently but then again that burden is not on you.", "NTA. Apart from your siblings, your father\u2019s side of the family sound like AWFUL people. He abandons you and they all cut contact? What the hell? If they were decent people it would be the other way around and they would cut him off and support you.\n\nAs far as stepmother\u2019s \u201cperfect man\u201d, how stupid is she? The fact that his kid wants nothing to do with him should be a major red flag. Instead of blaming you she ought to be asking why you want nothing to do with him.", "NTA! Please don't buy into their bullshit. I am sorry but you don't just have all family cut ties because you left your child. All of your dad's family needs to stay away from you. I am so sorry you are having to deal with this. Please forget everything they said. Even what your sister said about being nicer. Your \"dad\" lost his rights to ask you for anything and so did his family.", "NTA it sounds like your father only reached out because his fiancee asked him to. I would start blocking him and his family,  the fact that the first contact they've had with you in 8 years is to call you names and be mean is insane. They need to be in your rearview. And why is your mother allowing this??", "NTA. Those adults should have reached out to you instead of putting the responsibility on a child. If you are certain that your mom didn't forbid/block the contact, then don't feel bad.\n\nFiance sounds like she's looking for an excuse to call off the wedding. Your dad didn't raise you because he wasn't around. Your dad cancelling the reunion because of just one person makes him (again) immature and irresponsible.\n\nDon't let them put all of this on you. None of it is your fault.", "NTA! \n\nYour father doesn\u2019t know who you are and hasn\u2019t made any effort to form a relationship with you until now. It seems he wants to meet for his own selfish reasons too. It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s remorseful or wants to mend the relationship. He wants you to be at this \u201creunion\u201d for his own selfish needs. \n\nYou have done a lot of work on yourself through therapy and you have your own family that does not include him. It\u2019s good that you put down those boundaries. The fact that he doesn\u2019t respect them, or have any empathy for how you feel towards him confirms that he is only thinking of himself. \n\nKeep focusing on yourself and your real family. Best of luck for college!", "NTA\n\nHe was a perfect man to his wife & his new children but not to yall. His family reaching out now is mind boggling! Your dad & his whole family need to be cut off.", "I'm so sorry this person has thrown you into turmoil. Nta. How can someone blame a kid for not maintaining the relationship.

Him being so perfect and all.", "NTA.  My father abandoned us when I was 2 years old (I'm F54 now).  I would never, ever feel I owe him anything.  I stopped having any familial duty to him the minute he left.  You don't have to be nice to him.  You don't even have to acknowledge his existence.  He left, not you.  You haven't done anything wrong.  The fact that his family is on his side is just disgusting.  \n\nGood luck, sweetie.  You'll be just fine.", "NTA you need to block all these folk harassing you ASAP!

After the wedding, he'd be NC again.\n\nYou would have gotten your hopes up and he would fail every time.  Your poor brother seems very optimisitc, thinking this 'reunion' was going to be great.

After that we never talked again until I was around 12 and he called me to tell me happy birthday, he called me one more time the same year to say merry Christmas, after that, I didn\u2019t hear from him again until three weeks ago when he called me.", "Thank you so much!

If the father actually cared and wanted to make amends and reunite like he said, he would\u2019ve done it sooner and not because his new fianc\u00e9 told him she wanted to meet them. \n\nThe fact that some family members are still on his side makes me think he told them a different story in which he is the victim. If he left when the OP was 8, he should feel more guilt.", "NTA NTA NTA don\u2019t you dare think you are the asshole in this instance! He and his family abandoned you and you found your new family to give you happiness. It was no way on you to instigate contact, that was his job and you DID try and he hung up on YOU. If that woman thinks he\u2019s \u201cperfect\u201d and actually knows the true story, they deserve each other. Try (easier said then done) to forget about him, he\u2019ll just make you miserable.", "He let you down, and you owe him nothing.\n\nAbsolutely NTA. Stay strong kid.", "NTA at all. If someone will to push again, just tell them you treat him the same way he treated you (hunged up phone call).", "The onus is not on a child to keep and maintain a relationship with the parent. That falls on the person who caused your existence. Pretty bold of his family to come after you when they never had a relationship with you either. You owe none of these trashy people anything. Give your time and love to people who give you their love and their time. \n\nNTA", "Nta and you weren't harsh at all. He's the adult/parent and he should act like it", "Young lady NTA, your dad, his side of the family and the new wife are huge AHs.", "Nta. You don\u2019t need to do anything but move on", "NTA your father sounds like a prize deadbeat. You have done nothing wrong all you have done is refuse to play along with his Web of lies about his kids. As for his family block and forget them they too walked away from an 8 Yr old.\nYou sounds a lovely balanced young lady. Move on forward with the family you have and block all contact with this poor excuse of a father. Good luck", "NTA op. They abandoned you at age 8. Nothing you say or do will be as bad as what they did. They are the assholes, each and everyone of them. The woman he planned to marry sounds like a piece of work too, they deserve each other.", "Lord help me, because super duper petty me would have been on that post so fast I would have received backlash. I will tell that woman, exactly what a perfect man is and I would tag all those \"family and friends\" and tell them exactly where to shove it and to lose my number in the process cause nah....nope", "I'd hardly class it as petty. It's a genuine honest question that I think deserves to be asked in a public forum so people can hear it.", "Exactly this! He abandoned a child (and so did his family) only to give her the responsibility when she is 17 because \u201cshe could have tried to stay in contact\u201d. No she couldn\u2019t have and shouldn\u2019t have because she was and still is a child. \n\nOP they were AHs to you. And now they are gaslighting you. You might post this on her Facebook indeed, because no one should abandon their children like your \u201cdad\u201d did. \n\nI have a partner with a son (now 7). And if he told me he didn\u2019t stay in touch with his child and would take no effort in staying in touch then I would definitely question his character. He might be a perfect man now (I doubt it) but you have met a very different man than she did.", "Right.  And why didn\u2019t his family stay in touch?", "who posts things like that and thinks people will agree", "These people, the hitherto loving aunts and uncles and grandparents and cousins - decided to drop the child because her father did, and now only call her to harass her. \n\nThat\u2019s not \u2018family\u2019 and dad deserves what he gets.", "She won\u2019t last long.", "Wow. I am so sorry.", "Please pay attention to your grammar though. If you join two things in the same sentence it's anD not an. That stuff drives me crazy.", "NTA. Perfect man? That's rich. Your bio \"dad\" abandoned you when you were 8, and it sounds like the rest of his family is as lousy as he is.", "NTA. I hope you read this, because I have an extremely similar father - he left when I was about one year old (he cheated on my mom, got another woman pregnant, and then gave the baby's name a nickname of my mom's first name [that she doesn't go by but still weird so I wanted to bring it up lol]). I dealt with abandonment issues as a kid and had to go to a lot of therapy over the years. My mom got married when I was 8 and I was adopted by my new dad. For all purposes, he's my dad - he picked up the slack and raised me as his own and I am forever grateful for him! I'm providing background so you know that I feel very similar to what you're going through. \n\nWhen my bio dad was having it rough with his wife (same woman from before) he had some sort of wake-up and wanted to reconnect with me (to be fair, I wouldn't have minded knowing his other kids, but his devil wife wouldn't let her precious daughter know about me despite the fact I've met her once when I was 5 and that was the last time I saw any of them lmao). I told him no. He called me bitter and resentful, but honestly I didn't need his shit. I had a better dad who didn't leave and actually cared. He can't come in nearly 20 years later crying about how now he felt bad about leaving me. We haven't talked since then and I'm much better off.\n\nAnyways, all this to say about your situation: he left. He's not your dad. You have a new dad, a new family. His family and your \"brother\" can honestly step off. They're adding to the trauma you've spent the last ten years working through. Just because he feels bad now doesn't mean you owe him ANYTHING. And his fiancee sounds like trash. A perfect man wouldn't abandon his own children. For your sake, cut all of them off, and if your brother continues this, cut HIM off. You do not need to be subjected to the emotional turmoil they're putting you through just so your so-called dad can feel better about the mistakes he's made in his life. I hope you find clarity and can move through this and I'm rooting for you!", "nta you should respond to step mothers post with the reason why you wouldnt attend and point out there is a pretty good chance he will do it again ... his family as just as bad ( please note i said his family since they also abandoned you )", "NTA absolutely not the AH.\n\nIf your dad really wanted a reconciliation he should have asked you to meet up with him and just him.  He should have apologised for ignoring your existance for 9 years. He should have abjectly apologised for putting the phone down on a sobbing 15yo. He should have put the time and effort in to  gradually re-building a relationship that he destroyed.\n\nAsking you to attend a reunion is, at best, crass, inappropriate and, it seems, motivated not by a genuine interest in re-kindling a relationship with you, but in keeping his fianc\u00e9e happy. \n\nI suspect his wedding being delayed is more to do with his fianc\u00e9e starting to question how 'perfect' her husband to be is and having doubts based upon his behaviour, not yours.\n\nFamily isn't always the people whose DNA you carry. You have nothing to feel guilty about, he made the choices not you and it's OK not to want to be involved with him in any way.", "Nopity nope NTA. This falls fully into the responsible adult parent. At the VERY LEAST he should have been reaching out and saying he regrets his choices and wants to get to know you and rebuild ties etc etc not \u201chey I need you to expedite my new marriage\u201d", "NTA\n\nYou've been inconvenient as a child and now he found a woman which seems to want to play the lovely step mother in a perfect patchwork family and he and his family are just too willing to please her. And there you dare not to fit into that image. And as everyone else is so willing to please this fantasy of a perfect patchwork family, regardless of how they have failed a little kid, you are now the bad one and the one and the one that made all THEIR failures. \n\nTell them to leave you alone and if they won't comply you'll get them for harassment.", "NTA. What kind of person abandons his 8 year old, hangs up on her when she\u2019s crying 7 years later, then turns around and wants something from her 2 years after that? Sounds like he painted an interesting sob story to new family and is trying to hide who he really is to them. The fact that the rest of his family shunned you for 9 years is also highly suspect. Doesn\u2019t matter if your mom and dad had something happen, you shouldn\u2019t have been treated like that, as an innocent child. It\u2019s hard to stand up for yourself, especially at your age. I\u2019m so proud of you! You don\u2019t owe them anything, especially after the way you were treated.", "NTA. And I'm so sorry.\n\nYou are the child in this relationship. It was never your responsibility to act as the grownup and have to reach out. Your dad left when you were little, and with no contact for years, lost every right to the title of dad.\n\nI find it funny that he wants you to get to know your siblings, but says nothing about you getting to know him? It would be a horribly awkward event.\n\nHe's realized the hard way that the consequences of his actions from years ago are now biting him in the a$$ and that he has no control over what you do. \n\nYou have done nothing wrong. Nothing. You don't owe him or his family anything. You didn't need to be nicer about what you said to him - you said it perfectly, and he needed to hear every word. Your brother and sister can choose to be involved with him if they want, but neither they nor the rest of your dads family has any right to come down on you.", "NTA. Your dad and his whole family are despicable pieces of trash, and his fiancee isn't too far behind. Though he may have told her that your mother kept him away from being in your life. Still not OK for her to have made that post.  \n\n\nI'd go the petty route and make my own Facebook post telling my side of the story, and send it to everyone then block them; change your number as well.", "NTA - in no way. Reading this made me so mad - you were a child and your \"father\" had seemingly no problem to cut you out of his life. His side of the family as well. They were the adults, they should have done better by you. They didn\u00b4t and they are still not taking responsibility for their unbelievable behaviour by calling YOU out?! That\u00b4 s so wrong and makes me so mad for you. You have done good to move on and please keep trying to make peace with it. It doesn\u00b4t have anything to do with you, some people are just so selfcentered. You might not make them see how wrong it is what they did (and still do!) to you, but you can choose to not engage in this fight. It\u00b4s not worth it and you\u00b4ll just get burned. Life is unfortunately not always fair like that, but you said in your post that you have a great family so try to find comfort in that. Don\u00b4t let them get into your head - it never was and never will be your responsibility what happens in that mans life as he abandoned you when you were 8 - not the other way around.", "NTA.  Wonder why \u201cFather of the Year\u201d postponed the wedding?  Trouble in paradise\u2014I guess.", "NTA. Dude is walking around spreading his seed and has no commitment to the kids he makes. He is not a father, he is not a dad, he is T A\u2026 \n\nDon\u2019t let this guilty eat you up. It\u2019s not in you it\u2019s in him. Block the negativity from your life. They don\u2019t deserve you.", "NTA. You are the child, he is the adult, maintaining a relationship is his responsibility, not yours and you should remind any member of his family that tries to call you out on that of that fact, and also that they abandoned you as well.", "NTA! you were a child and he abandoned you, he can't come back now you're all grown up and try to make you pretend he didn't leave so his new wife and him can play happy family. It was mever your job to make amends, he was the adult, he left, they all cut contact, you didn't do anything wrong. Cut them out of your life and don't give them another thought. \nYou deserve better than this", "Himm wich one should reach first a kid or grown as adults i wonder", "NTA. Your dad and his new wife are the As here. Also your brother. None of this is your fault. They just don\u2019t want to deal with the consequences of their own actions and are projecting everything on you. I\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with this. Maybe reach out to your therapist and talk it over with them.", "NTA, no, you weren't wrong to be harsh. Your dad's family are the awful ones for daring to call you now, after all those years not even caring for your existence.\n\nSorry you had to deal with this nonsense, you're right he only reached out to play \"perfect man\" to his new delusional fianc\u00e9e.", "NTA.  He ran out on you when you were a child.  He doesn\u2019t get to act like nothing happened now.", "NTA. Your father is an absolute loser. You should be grateful that none of his new family will be in your life - though I\u2019m sure they\u2019re victims of his lies.\n\nTry get him out of your head entirely. He sounds like a selfish narcissist.", "NTA, you were a CHILD. What is wrong with those people?!", "NTA at all, but a bit of perspective, if I may? Human nature is a funny thing. Someday, you may have regrets. None of this was your fault and I applaud the work you\u2019ve put in. But\u2026 your dad may have some regrets, too. He\u2019s postponed his wedding after she said that stuff, right? It may be worth just one honest conversation between you and your dad. Not for him. For you. You don\u2019t have to do this, you don\u2019t owe him this. But you may find it cathartic. You sound like a great kid with a good head. Just some food for thought.", "I don't understand why women fall for this kind of dude. \"He has kids he hasn't spoken to in almost a decade. I can definitely rely on this man to love and support me and my family.\"", "Yes - and/or 'i can't believe that there are adult out there who form a devastating opinions of someone they have never met by hearing just one side of the story'", "The petty is strong with you.\n\nBut seriously Op, you did great blocking those jerks, it was wise of you. Your father should still be ashamed of himself and that so called wife should mind her own circus and not start being a ring leader of another.", "It takes a tone of perfection to abandon your kids and cut them of completely from your family and extended family and contact them again when your fiance forces you. That screams total perfection. Also their family is pure perfection for wanting a 9-10 yo contacting grown ass adults and  ask them on their luck of communication. They are a bundle of bubbly and glittery perfection. Also I don't get how \"bad kids from previous wedding\" can postpone a wedding... Only logical explanation is that new fiance was fed lies about those kids and she started to see that there is something fishy with her perfect specimen of a fiance....", "I was thinking the exact same thing. If she wants to talk shit then it should be put out there exactly why OP doesn't want to go.", "What kind of parent would abandon their children like that? He is awful. And OP is NTA", "True and then found out the truth, maybe from big sister or pieced it together from what the other relatives have said. I hope this is the case."]}
