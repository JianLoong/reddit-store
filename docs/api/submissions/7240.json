She just wanted to try to guilt you into giving her the coat.", "NTA- sounds like she wanted to resale it and got mad that you snagged it first!", "NTA. I bet she didn't see it until it was in your hand", "NTA. When you're going to buy something, you don't put it back on the rack, you hang onto it until you're finished looking, then proceed to the counter. And who's to say you weren't getting it for someone who didn't have a warm jacket", "NTA. If she was going to buy it she shouldn't have put it back.", "NTA.  I had to look up Belstaff jackets.  It wouldn\u2019t matter if it was a jacket from from the big blue store, you had it in your possession first. If I\u2019m in a store and I like something I take it, if I see something else and decide to have a look I don\u2019t put the first thing back to check it out.", "'Struggling family' sounds like BS to me. Bet she didn't see it first, she was just trying it on when she saw what you had. NTA", "Nta if she wanted it she should have grabbed it, if it was the only jacket there it could have been a different story but you did nothing wrong", "NTA. If she wanted it then she should have taken it instead of leaving it on the rack. She probably didn't even see it until she saw that you had what she wanted. Please stop calling ignorant people Karen's. How would you like it if someone used your name like a dirty word?", "NTA - Was it the only jacket in the store? If \u201cKaren\u201d needed a jacket so desperately she should have held onto it or found another one.", "She did not have legitimate dibs. You don't leave muffins in the produce!", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I've had people try to start going through my cart while I was standing with it in the checkout line.   I may have used a decidedly outdoor volume on what my husband calls the Voice Of Furry Doom^(TM)  when I told them to back off and go get their own stuff.", "Thrift store etiquette dictates that if you want to buy something, you grab it and hold onto it until you get to the checkout. If it isn't in someone's hands already, it's fair game. Even if she was telling the truth about having seen it first, she lost all claim to it when she walked away from it. I've seen some pretty shameful behavior while thrifting, and my bet would be that she only saw it after OP had it and was trying to shame OP into giving it up. NTA. Enjoy the coat", "NTA.  I suspect she saw it in your hands and liked it, and thought she could manipulate you into giving it up.  Don\u2019t give it a second thought.  If she really needed a jacket to stay warm,  there are plenty of other jackets available.  She is 100% a manipulator.", "NTA you came by it fair and square. She was probably lying about seeing it first, and if not, she lost her claim by putting it back on the rack.", "If she was going to buy it she would have taken it with her to go look at the other thing. Nta, don't feel bad either, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA Sounds like she didn\u2019t see it until she was in line.", "NTA. The jacket was on the rack - in a cart. Not in someone\u2019s basket or fitting room door. \n\nAnd she doesn\u2019t know?? If the jacket is for you? Your kid/brother who needs a warm jacket? You don\u2019t owe her that information. She was trying to play the sympathy card and it didn\u2019t work.", "NTA. You like an item? You carry it around the shop with you. That's shopping 101. Anything on the shelf/hanger is free game.", "NTA. You keep it with you not put it back on the rail.", "Winners rules: put it in your cart, decide later.", "No", "Probably saw the brand and just pulled the story out thier a$$ from next to thier head. As someone who has struggled I would take any coat in wearable condition from a theft store.", "I seriously doubt she put it back to look at something else. When you find certain brands at thrift stores, and it\u2019s a size you\u2019re looking for, you don\u2019t put it down to look at something else. She played every card in her hand: lying, poverty, tantrum.", "I would disagree with you on that, i think its a very practical jacket, it is warm and i don't think they go for looks solely. It is high quality made, its British and I thought it was more a biker brand. That's the only reason I recognised it. \nIt was certainly warm & cosy on this evenings dog walk but I'll definitely give it a full British weather test \ud83d\udc4d", "Don't steal a meal from a Navy seal!", "Oh definitely. I\u2019m so tired of people pulling the \u201cyou have to let me have this, it\u2019s the only option for me\u201d argument when it\u2019s clearly not true. It\u2019s just something they say to try to get what they want.\n\nAs you said, there were many other jackets. She might not even have seen that one until she saw you with it.", "Honestly if I see something at a normal store that is great and the right size I\u2019m keeping hold of that shit until It\u2019s time to pay.", "Totally off topic...I did once \"steal\" someone's grocery cart. Just walked down 2 aisles before I realized nothing in the cart was what I had put there...I was carrying a newborn and sleep deprivation is a thing. The woman I \"stole\" the cart from actually apologized to me when I returned hers and took mine because she couldn't find me.", "Yes! Most of my clothes and some of the stuff in my home are from charity shops. It feels great finding the odd treasure and only paying a small amount from the budget for a good quality item. This has been my best find, it will last me years I bet.", "Definitely", "I've had my Belstaff Roadmaster for 15 years and wear it at least once a week when the weather calls for it.", "Biker?\nMy dad loved his Belstaff gear", "Utter baloney that she saw it first and planned to buy it but put it back to keep browsing.  1000% guaranteed that the first time she saw it was when you were waiting to check out and she thought she could pull a fast one on you.\n\nNTA, and enjoy the heck out of your lovely new jacket!", "Nta If she really wanted it or was even thinking about getting it she shouldn't have put it back.", "I'm so happy redditors were able to help you out of feeling bad about the situation! Any chance we could get a picture of the coveted jacket? Please sooner feel bad if you don't want to upload one! I was just wondering what it looked like lol.", "Exactly what everyone does. If there are several of the items and it's a bit bulky, maybe you leave and come back for it. But if there's only one... who TF would put it back if you knew you wanted it?! No one. As others said, she most likely saw the brand and wanted it for resale."]}
