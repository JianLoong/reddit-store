Picking up a steak to take bites out of it?  That\u2019s caveman eating.", "NTA. That\u2019s pretty atrocious behavior, especially in public. She needed to be called out.", "If this is how it actually went, then NTA. \n\nJust picking up the steak and taking bites is just so odd, but I wouldn't say that it's all that bad, but chewing with her mouth open? There's not a most disgusting sound in the world to me, and I have known some people that can get nauseous by hearing it for long enough. I shivered just imagining the sound.", "Nta and and your sister sounds like an infant, does she sit and eat with friends at lunch in her school, how can she think that is ok?", "NTA, I'd lose my appetite just by hearing the sound. It would be okay for your sister to act that way at least if you were at home, but you are in public. Also, it didn't seem like you were mocking her, and you were being very polite by asking her to please use proper table manners.", "NTA. That sounds disgusting and she should be respectful at the dinner table.", "NTA. It's common courtesy not to eat and sound like an animal while eating in front of others.", "I was prepared to give asshole judgement until you said what the offense was. NTA and that isn\u2019t even manners so much as being a decent person \ud83d\ude2c", "INFO: do you come from a culture that it\u2019s not uncommon to eat with hands? Also, in the post you say you were taught manners, but in a comment you say you never really ate at a table and she wasn\u2019t taught table manners. So just to be clear was your sister taught manners and was choosing not to use them, or was she never taught?", "NTA. That\u2019s truly repulsive. She needs to learn not to do that.

Framing it differently might actually get you want.", "I'm going to take a different approach and say NTA ish because I think you might be boarderline. First off did it ever occur to you that she was doing it just to piss you off? And you took the bait.  Secondly don't parent your younger siblings it leads to resentment from them towards you. The fact your father didn't say anything before until you piped up tells me he was letting her get it out and only wanted to stop the fight when you opened your mouth. Maybe part of some manners you need to learn is letting it go and blocking things out because guess what there are many people in the word who will chew with their mouth open and make noises. You will learn this rough lesson in a staff room at lunch time.  \nStart taking deep breathes when she irritates you and don't rise to the challenge.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
