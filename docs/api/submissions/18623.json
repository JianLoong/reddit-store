My fianc\u00e9e mentioned that she wanted to wait to announce it at her cousin\u2019s wedding which will be taking place on Sunday. Her cousin and her husband has been struggling getting pregnant even with IVF or the tons of others. Recently they just got some news that their insurance has stopped funding IVF and not to mention the heartbreak of a recent miscarriage on Mothers Day. They almost understandably held off on the wedding.   \n\nSo when my fianc\u00e9e brought it up to me, I told her it\u2019s not at all a good idea. This just seemed so wrong, especially it being at their wedding. I asked, if she was gonna at least ask her cousin for permission and she said, no because she wanted it to be a surprise for everyone. I told her it\u2019s not the time nor the place for that and it would take the spotlight off the couple(in her family there hasn\u2019t been a baby in 3 years so we\u2019d be the first in that time).   \n\nFianc\u00e9e feels that\u2019s the perfect time because it\u2019s such a joy and it\u2019s not like she can keep it away forever and their problems shouldn\u2019t keep her from telling something so positive, so it's on them if they turn it negative. I told her that\u2019s not the point, she knows what they\u2019ve been through and she\u2019s being selfish if she actually goes through with that. She cried and claimed I wasn\u2019t being supportive and I shouldn\u2019t be calling my pregnant fiancee selfish. She doesn\u2019t want me to come with her to the wedding anymore either, feeling as if I would \u2018kill the mood\u2019. She hasn\u2019t been talking to me either", "created_utc": 1685544244, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wo6bs/aita_for_calling_my_fianc\u00e9e_selfish_for_wanting/", "score": 323, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She definitely loves herself above everyone else including you.", "NTA and your fianc\u00e9 is massively TA\n\nNot only announcing at someone else\u2019s WEDDING an important day for them, but announcing it at someone\u2019s wedding who was/is struggling to conceive. She\u2019s massively the AH.", "NTA\n\nHer announcement will traumatize the couple that is getting married. It's such a horribly selfish move that I'm having trouble believing this post is real.

Is she always this oblivious?  This is unbelievably cruel.\n\nEdit, spelling and its her cousin. It's been a long day.", "NTA. Give the cousin a call and let them know what's up.

The fact she won\u2019t ask her cousin means she knows what she wants to do is wrong.\n\nHonestly at this point do you have any contact with her cousin/family? Would it be worth reaching out to try to warn them? Or maybe do some sort of preemptive party/announcement?\n\nPersonally I\u2019d view this as a huge red flag that your fianc\u00e9 cant comprehend having another occasion to announce this, and wants to ruin her cousin\u2019s wedding day with this.", "NTA - She *IS* being selfish.  Not a place or time to announce a pregnancy.", "NTA. The bride will hold it against her forever and a day. It's her wedding day, not a public service announcement service.", "NTA.  If she is insistent on being so unbelievably cruel, let her go to the wedding alone and make the announcement on her own and take the heat on her own.  And if people ask why you weren\u2019t there say it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to announce.  If she is going to INSIST on this, then it be all on her. If she\u2019s so right, then she should be fine with that.  \n\nAlso, I\u2019d seriously rethink any relationship with someone who is capable of treating others this way.  It\u2019s appalling and if I were her cousin and family, I would never forgive her.", "NTA. But please stop your girlfriend from doing this. It will absolutly destroy her cousins wedding. And she is more than selfish wanting to anounce that at the wedding! This is the absolute worst and selfish thing she can do, especially knowing her cousins background. \n\nIf your fiancy is not willing to let go of this idea, please tell her cousin about her plan, so the are warned, can uninvite her or throw her out. But they are paying a lot of money and it should be a hapy day for them, to forget all the negative that happened for them in the past. And your girlfriend not only wants to steal the spotlight away from them but hurt them by reminding them of what they don't have and might never will have. Yeah it is a great joy for you two, that you are expecting but you will have this joy for 9 months and longer. So don't ruin the couples big day", "NTA. Why would she EVER think that she's doing the right thing with this? there are literally dozens of feeds on here of people doing something similar and absolutely DESTROYING the bride and groom", "NTA- but your fiancee is. Is this the first time you've witnessed her be this cruel and selfish? I'd be thinking about whether you want to really marry this person. I guess you're stuck with her as a co-parent, but yeah.", "NTA.  Do NOT LET HER DO THIS. Apart from it being bloody rude to do at a wedding ANYWAY if it\u2019s not the bride, these people had a miscarriage how many weeks ago?", "Thank you for being the sane one. Only an asshole hijacks someone else's special day for their own selfish announcement. The cousin has been planning her perfect day for months, the last thing she needs is for some idiot to swoop in unannounced and steal the spotlight.

Do not let fianc\u00e9e follow through on this awful plan.", "What a disgustingly selfish horrible thing to do. It\u2019s not etiquette to announce anything at someone else\u2019s wedding anyway, but to do it at someone\u2019s wedding who have just had a miscarriage and have difficulty in getting pregnant is beyond belief. \n\nPersonally I wouldn\u2019t go with her anyway, it will be an awful day for you knowing the misery she\u2019s going to cause. \n\nBTW OP, she\u2019s showing you the sort of person she truly is, be warned..", "NTA.  And I would tell her that if she does this then you may have to reevaluate having a future with her.  \n\nHer doing this at her cousins wedding is disrespectful and disgusting.  Even a bigger major blow is them going through IVF with difficulties and having someone else try to not only steal their spotlight at their wedding but rub their nose in it also with a baby they cannot have. \n\nShe is very selfish and I would really consider if you want to marry this woman who has no empathy and no respect for anyone.  She is doing this because she is cruel and she knows what it will do.  She obviously has an issue with thr cousin and craves attention for herself and wants it for herself.   \n\nShow this selfish woman this thread!  \n\nTell her to expect NO contact with her family if she does this.", "OP if I were you, I would tell my cousin what she was gonna do \n\nNTA at all", "NTA\nDude, you CANNOT let her do this.

Real gem you found there \u2026", "NTA. The fact that she is, without an ounce of shame, considering basically rubbing her pregnancy in their faces AT THEIR OWN WEDDING is a football field of red flags. \ud83d\udea9If I were her cousin I'd never speak to her again.", "Please warn the cousin now.  This would be an incredibly cruel think for your fiance to do and it could destroy all her happiness in the day.  Also, are you sure you want to marry someone so utterly self involved?", "Holy fuck, NTA. Like, she just found out, right? It's not even a good idea to tell people at all yet.", "NTA. She sounds really selfish. Honestly I would let her cousin know what your fianc\u00e9 plans to do if she refuses to change her mind", "NTA.\n\nIs this is really the person you want to marry? Someone with so little emotional maturity, not to mention *empathy* to see this is a horrible idea?\n\nYou\u2019re already in for a kid\u2026 but yeesh. I\u2019d be having a very hard talk with her about turning someone\u2019s spotlight day into a day about her and why it\u2019s bad- but from the sounds of it you already have and she *still* doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nI\u2019m all for being understanding of pregnancy hormones and brain chemicals being shifted thanks to it, but using it as a reason to guilt you onto her side is shit manipulation. Not cool.", "Honestly I can\u2019t believe she doesn\u2019t see how hurtful it could potentially be or that it IS, in fact, selfish. NTA but she is.", "NTA\nI would give the groom a heads up and discuss ways to mitigate the situation if that happens, like not giving your fiancee the microphone.", "Please show your fiancee these posts to give her perspective that NO ONE thinks her announcement at the wedding is a good idea.\n\nHoly shit, is she oblivious how cruel this would be.  NTA", "NTA and thank you for sticking up for that couple. Simple wedding etiquette is don\u2019t wear white, don\u2019t propose, and don\u2019t announce your pregnancy. It\u2019s the couple\u2019s day- not hers. Her announcing her pregnancy is especially inconsiderate considering its a sensitive subject for the bride and groom. She can make the announcement at any other time! No rational person wouldn\u2019t see all the major issues with her idea. Her reasoning is so off with \u201cwell this is good for me, so I\u2019m going to not only detract from their special day but also choose to lack any empathy for how this may affect them, again, ON THEIR DAY\u201d. \n\nIf she\u2019s actually going to go through with this, and disinvites you from the wedding, I\u2019d reach out to the couple and let them know why you aren\u2019t attending and what she\u2019s intending to do. Lord knows if someone was planning this at my wedding I\u2019d want a heads up so I could say \u201cabsolutely not do not do that at my wedding it\u2019s my day not yours\u201d and also have my maid of honor prepped to remove them should they try.", "Are you close with your future in-laws? If you are i'd suggest telling her mum and telling her mum why you're letting it slip. She's very likely to want to help keep the news private until after her niece's day.

If this is no surprise I'm sorry for you.", "NTA and if you're able, give her family a heads up (her parents, maybe not the bride and groom). Like, yeah you're ruining the surprise of telling her parents but I'd definitely ruin that before she ruins her cousins wedding.", "NTA at all. It\u2019s really selfish and disrespectful to announce your own news at someone\u2019s wedding, it\u2019s even worse that the cousin has been struggling with fertility. If she\u2019s so insistent i would honestly warn the cousin or something and make sure someone has eyes on her and doesn\u2019t allow her to make an announcement.

Sure fianc\u00e9e, go ahead and take this one thing away from your cousin, and you will have the whole family looking at you as the parish you deserve to be, that child will have a horrible legacy to be borne into. \n\nOP think twice about YOUR wedding.

But the problem is not that she is selfish, it\u2019s that she is callous and cruel. People with fertility issues often have traumas, especially with repeated miscarriages.

My fianc\u00e9e mentioned that she wanted to wait to announce it at her cousin\u2019s wedding which will be taking place on Sunday. Her cousin and her husband has been struggling getting pregnant even with IVF or the tons of others. Recently they just got some news that their insurance has stopped funding IVF and not to mention the heartbreak of a recent miscarriage on Mothers Day. They almost understandably held off on the wedding.   \n\nSo when my fianc\u00e9e brought it up to me, I told her it\u2019s not at all a good idea. This just seemed so wrong, especially it being at their wedding. I asked, if she was gonna at least ask her cousin for permission and she said, no because she wanted it to be a surprise for everyone. I told her it\u2019s not the time nor the place for that and it would take the spotlight off the couple(in her family there hasn\u2019t been a baby in 3 years so we\u2019d be the first in that time).   \n\nFianc\u00e9e feels that\u2019s the perfect time because it\u2019s such a joy and it\u2019s not like she can keep it away forever and their problems shouldn\u2019t keep her from telling something so positive, so it's on them if they turn it negative. I told her that\u2019s not the point, she knows what they\u2019ve been through and she\u2019s being selfish if she actually goes through with that. She cried and claimed I wasn\u2019t being supportive and I shouldn\u2019t be calling my pregnant fiancee selfish. She doesn\u2019t want me to come with her to the wedding anymore either, feeling as if I would \u2018kill the mood\u2019. She hasn\u2019t been talking to me either\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s an asshole move to announce at someone else\u2019s wedding but knowing the fertile issues the couple is having makes fianc\u00e9 cruel.", "I think a warning needs to happen, but it feels wrong to me to put that on the couple when they're already going through a lot. Maybe OP could loop in another family member that they can trust to stop her before she makes the announcement? \n\nWe did something similar at a friend's wedding because her mom liked to make speeches and include humiliating stories. We got wind that she was planning a speech against my friends wishes and one of us stuck to her mom like glue the whole time so she didn't have the opportunity to grab a mike or interupt the dj.", "Oof!  That would just hasten the inevitable breakup\ud83d\ude0a", "Not to mention the heart break of the cousins recently in Mother\u2019s Day having a miscarriage and finding out insurance won\u2019t fund further IVF.   This would absolutely be the wrong time and place to announce her new pregnancy.  It would completely ruin the mood.  The girlfriend is absolutely selfish and clueless to the audience this would be going to.\nOops:  forgot to add NTA but girlfriend is.", "This! Tell MOB and her mum too. Hopefully both can talk some sense into her. \n\nI'm hoping her joy is so much that she is not seeing how off this is on so many levels! Like you don't do that on someone's wedding day! Also to someone who has been trying for years, had a miscarriage and now insurance is not funding the IVF! She needs to consider others feelings and what she is doing isn't good at all.", "That's  a great idea.\n\nBut I would tell them that she is pregnant and wants to announce.\n\nThis would give them time to literally block her from attending the reception.", "Yep, this woman is an incredibly self-centred AH. Is this someone to be married to?", "This I came here to say this. Call her cousin and give her a heads up. I also would rethink this relationship. She does not come off as a good person at all. NTA", "Or at least the parents of the couple.", "No he shouldn\u2019t really worry about that he should tell her she\u2019s being a selfish heartless AH. And he will not accept her announcing their pregnancy at someone\u2019s wedding and he should just tell everyone her plan so she doesn\u2019t even get that chance to destroy someone else\u2019s day by being cruel. She\u2019s honestly so cruel and self-centred how could she even then this would go down well these people have been going through heart break after heart break trying for a kid", "And unfortunately, he already knocked the selfish, spot light hogging asshole up. So he\u2019s stuck with her in his life forever. Ugh. \n\nJust announcing at someone else\u2019s wedding is bad on its own but knowing the history of the bride and groom\u2019s fertility issues brings it into intentional cruelty territory. She wants to  or only steal the spotlight from the v]bride, she wants the bride to feel miserable on HER big day. I\u2019d run for the hills.", "Exactly. I read the beginning and thought \"NTA. Someone else's wedding is neither place nor time for such an announcement.\" Then I got to the part about cousin's fertility struggles... Jeez, that wouldn't be simply rude, it would be cruel.", "OP ain\u2019t all that sane!  He made a life with her.", "No! I genuinely think this would ruin the cousin\u2019s wedding. They don\u2019t deserve it either.", "Totally unfair to the bride.  It will absolutely ruin her day. And gawdforbid, the family  swarms her leaving the bride off to the side.", "I like that idea, so long as OP also gives the bride and groom a heads-up so they aren't blindsided and can make a plan to eject the woman.", "No!  Don't even let her go to the wedding.  \n\nIf I were OP I would get in the car with the fianc\u00e9e like we're headed to the wedding venue, then drive in the opposite direction for as long as possible without stopping.", "I have been pregnant SEVEN times and I am currently. Hormones are not an excuse to be cruel or a \u201cpass\u201d to not understand the difference between right or wrong. Hormones have NOTHING to do with this. Also who hasn\u2019t heard of pregnancy hormones???", "I\u2019ve had 4 pregnancies so I\u2019m very familiar with pregnancy hormones, never experienced them making me want to behave so callously though. Pregnancy hormones are wild but they don\u2019t block your ability to have some basic consideration and empathy.", "I do not know a single woman who when they were pregnant would have thought this to be a good idea.", "I've been pregnant 3 times and at no point was I ever this massive of an asshole. Hormones can make things difficult but she is still and adult and responsible for her crummy behavior. OOP is NTA.", ">She may not realize it but she's being incredibly cruel.\n\n\nI had to look up the age again. Bro, she is 29. Not 9. \nAlso bro, pregnancy hormone what?", "lol sorry but no. it\u2019s doesn\u2019t apply here. being pregnant myself, with my rainbow baby, i can not imagine ever doing something this heartless. i believe this girl wants to rub in their faces the fact that she\u2019s pregnant. life after a pregnancy loss is so hard. you start to realize how many pregnant women there are around you, not a day goes by where you don\u2019t think about the baby you lost, in your head you count down how many weeks you would\u2019ve been, i wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone. \n\nOP, please warn the couple ahead of time so they can put the proper steps in place to prevent this from happening. your fianc\u00e9 is being extremely cruel, selfish and everything in between. congratulations on your baby and i hope you guys can announce it at more appropriate time. NTA.", "I've been pregnant twice, and not once have my hormones driven me to steal someone's spotlight. Once I was pregnant and went to a cousins graduation party....didn't tell anyone. The day wasn't about ME.\n\nHormones aren't to blame for this woman's cruel attitude and decision making.", "Pregnancy hormones shouldn't impair someone's judgment and empathy to the extent of cruelty. This is a whole new level of selfishness, and she is using her pregnancy as an occasion for it", "I don't think she's a bad person, but she isn't thinking straight, hormones or not. Maybe OP should pose it like this - imagine the shoe on the other foot. Like it was her pregnancy announcement celebration, and cousin decides to announce her engagement to everyone at fiancee's celebration. How would she feel in that moment?", "If I was OP I would highly consider warning the cousin but that could definitely cause marriage problems. Or spoiling the surprise ahead of time so she couldn\u2019t do it on the wedding day. NTA", "The fiancee should open her announcement with \"Well your wedding has been great fun so far, now let me completely ruin any memory you might have had of it!\"", "Yeah that would be good.  Fiance would absolutely ruin the wedding, which would probably have been the one thing making them feel good.  She doesn't sound like she'd have enough impulse control to keep the secret.", "If she can\u2019t be reasoned with, honestly I\u2019d make the announcement via Facebook a few days prior to the wedding", "Yes he should. And have cousin not allow her In. Or he can announce the pregnancy today and take the wind out of her sails.", "Oops not sure how I managed that, thanks.\n\nAnd yeah. I wouldn't do this to my worst enemy.", "Part of me wonders if there's some hormone induced imbalance,  but Idk if it's just that I don't want people to be this horrible.", "I expected this to be a post about how rude it is to announce pregnancy/propose, etc. at someone's wedding/baby shower/engagement party. Then, he throws in all the fertility issues, and his fianc\u00e9e is actually a ghoul. \n\nEven if she agrees to not announce, she's going to be rubbing her stomach and loudly turning down booze while winking.", "Totally agree. Pregnancy hormones are not an excuse.  I was 'designated driver' for a friend's wedding to excuse the lack of drinking until a later date when we informed everyone I was pregnant."]}
