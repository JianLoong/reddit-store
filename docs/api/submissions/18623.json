My fianc\u00e9e mentioned that she wanted to wait to announce it at her cousin\u2019s wedding which will be taking place on Sunday. Her cousin and her husband has been struggling getting pregnant even with IVF or the tons of others. Recently they just got some news that their insurance has stopped funding IVF and not to mention the heartbreak of a recent miscarriage on Mothers Day. They almost understandably held off on the wedding.   \n\nSo when my fianc\u00e9e brought it up to me, I told her it\u2019s not at all a good idea. This just seemed so wrong, especially it being at their wedding. I asked, if she was gonna at least ask her cousin for permission and she said, no because she wanted it to be a surprise for everyone. I told her it\u2019s not the time nor the place for that and it would take the spotlight off the couple(in her family there hasn\u2019t been a baby in 3 years so we\u2019d be the first in that time).   \n\nFianc\u00e9e feels that\u2019s the perfect time because it\u2019s such a joy and it\u2019s not like she can keep it away forever and their problems shouldn\u2019t keep her from telling something so positive, so it's on them if they turn it negative. I told her that\u2019s not the point, she knows what they\u2019ve been through and she\u2019s being selfish if she actually goes through with that. She cried and claimed I wasn\u2019t being supportive and I shouldn\u2019t be calling my pregnant fiancee selfish. She doesn\u2019t want me to come with her to the wedding anymore either, feeling as if I would \u2018kill the mood\u2019. She hasn\u2019t been talking to me either\n\nEdit: So about my fianc\u00e9e and her cousins relationship. My fianc\u00e9e always saw competition in her cousin because her cus would be better at some things than her. (Grades, Dancing, Cosmetics, etc.) since they were kids and she hates that. Last year they had an argument about it because fianc\u00e9e felt her cus bragged too much, where as my fianc\u00e9e also mentioned \u201cthere was one thing her cus wasn\u2019t good at\u201d but never said what it was. So in shorter terms the relationship is in between good and bad, but her cus wanted to invite her to the wedding, I\u2019m guessing to rekindle that.", "created_utc": 1685544244, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wo6bs/aita_for_calling_my_fianc\u00e9e_selfish_for_wanting/", "score": 6105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Would it be worth reaching out to try to warn them? Or maybe do some sort of preemptive party/announcement?\n\nPersonally I\u2019d view this as a huge red flag that your fianc\u00e9 cant comprehend having another occasion to announce this, and wants to ruin her cousin\u2019s wedding day with this.", "NTA - She *IS* being selfish.

If she is insistent on being so unbelievably cruel, let her go to the wedding alone and make the announcement on her own and take the heat on her own.

If she\u2019s so right, then she should be fine with that.  \n\nAlso, I\u2019d seriously rethink any relationship with someone who is capable of treating others this way.  It\u2019s appalling and if I were her cousin and family, I would never forgive her.", "NTA. But please stop your girlfriend from doing this. It will absolutly destroy her cousins wedding.

This is the absolute worst and selfish thing she can do, especially knowing her cousins background. \n\nIf your fiancy is not willing to let go of this idea, please tell her cousin about her plan, so the are warned, can uninvite her or throw her out. But they are paying a lot of money and it should be a hapy day for them, to forget all the negative that happened for them in the past. And your girlfriend not only wants to steal the spotlight away from them but hurt them by reminding them of what they don't have and might never will have. Yeah it is a great joy for you two, that you are expecting but you will have this joy for 9 months and longer. So don't ruin the couples big day", "NTA.

Is this the first time you've witnessed her be this cruel and selfish? I'd be thinking about whether you want to really marry this person. I guess you're stuck with her as a co-parent, but yeah.", "NTA.  Do NOT LET HER DO THIS. Apart from it being bloody rude to do at a wedding ANYWAY if it\u2019s not the bride, these people had a miscarriage how many weeks ago?", "Thank you for being the sane one. Only an asshole hijacks someone else's special day for their own selfish announcement.

Do not let fianc\u00e9e follow through on this awful plan.", "What a disgustingly selfish horrible thing to do. It\u2019s not etiquette to announce anything at someone else\u2019s wedding anyway, but to do it at someone\u2019s wedding who have just had a miscarriage and have difficulty in getting pregnant is beyond belief. \n\nPersonally I wouldn\u2019t go with her anyway, it will be an awful day for you knowing the misery she\u2019s going to cause. \n\nBTW OP, she\u2019s showing you the sort of person she truly is, be warned..", "NTA.  And I would tell her that if she does this then you may have to reevaluate having a future with her.  \n\nHer doing this at her cousins wedding is disrespectful and disgusting.  Even a bigger major blow is them going through IVF with difficulties and having someone else try to not only steal their spotlight at their wedding but rub their nose in it also with a baby they cannot have. \n\nShe is very selfish and I would really consider if you want to marry this woman who has no empathy and no respect for anyone.  She is doing this because she is cruel and she knows what it will do.  She obviously has an issue with thr cousin and craves attention for herself and wants it for herself.   \n\nShow this selfish woman this thread!  \n\nTell her to expect NO contact with her family if she does this.", "OP if I were you, I would tell my cousin what she was gonna do \n\nNTA at all", "NTA\nDude, you CANNOT let her do this.

The fact that she is, without an ounce of shame, considering basically rubbing her pregnancy in their faces AT THEIR OWN WEDDING is a football field of red flags. \ud83d\udea9If I were her cousin I'd never speak to her again.", "Please warn the cousin now.  This would be an incredibly cruel thing for your fiance to do and it could destroy all her happiness in the day.

She sounds really selfish. Honestly I would let her cousin know what your fianc\u00e9 plans to do if she refuses to change her mind", "NTA.\n\nIs this is really the person you want to marry? Someone with so little emotional maturity, not to mention *empathy* to see this is a horrible idea?\n\nYou\u2019re already in for a kid\u2026 but yeesh. I\u2019d be having a very hard talk with her about turning someone\u2019s spotlight day into a day about her and why it\u2019s bad- but from the sounds of it you already have and she *still* doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nI\u2019m all for being understanding of pregnancy hormones and brain chemicals being shifted thanks to it, but using it as a reason to guilt you onto her side is shit manipulation. Not cool.", "Honestly I can\u2019t believe she doesn\u2019t see how hurtful it could potentially be or that it IS, in fact, selfish. NTA but she is.", "NTA\nI would give the groom a heads up and discuss ways to mitigate the situation if that happens, like not giving your fiancee the microphone.", "Please show your fiancee these posts to give her perspective that NO ONE thinks her announcement at the wedding is a good idea.\n\nHoly shit, is she oblivious how cruel this would be.  NTA", "NTA and thank you for sticking up for that couple. Simple wedding etiquette is don\u2019t wear white, don\u2019t propose, and don\u2019t announce your pregnancy. It\u2019s the couple\u2019s day- not hers. Her announcing her pregnancy is especially inconsiderate considering its a sensitive subject for the bride and groom. She can make the announcement at any other time! No rational person wouldn\u2019t see all the major issues with her idea. Her reasoning is so off with \u201cwell this is good for me, so I\u2019m going to not only detract from their special day but also choose to lack any empathy for how this may affect them, again, ON THEIR DAY\u201d. \n\nIf she\u2019s actually going to go through with this, and disinvites you from the wedding, I\u2019d reach out to the couple and let them know why you aren\u2019t attending and what she\u2019s intending to do. Lord knows if someone was planning this at my wedding I\u2019d want a heads up so I could say \u201cabsolutely not do not do that at my wedding it\u2019s my day not yours\u201d and also have my maid of honor prepped to remove them should they try.", "Are you close with your future in-laws?

My fianc\u00e9e mentioned that she wanted to wait to announce it at her cousin\u2019s wedding which will be taking place on Sunday. Her cousin and her husband has been struggling getting pregnant even with IVF or the tons of others. Recently they just got some news that their insurance has stopped funding IVF and not to mention the heartbreak of a recent miscarriage on Mothers Day. They almost understandably held off on the wedding.   \n\nSo when my fianc\u00e9e brought it up to me, I told her it\u2019s not at all a good idea. This just seemed so wrong, especially it being at their wedding. I asked, if she was gonna at least ask her cousin for permission and she said, no because she wanted it to be a surprise for everyone. I told her it\u2019s not the time nor the place for that and it would take the spotlight off the couple(in her family there hasn\u2019t been a baby in 3 years so we\u2019d be the first in that time).   \n\nFianc\u00e9e feels that\u2019s the perfect time because it\u2019s such a joy and it\u2019s not like she can keep it away forever and their problems shouldn\u2019t keep her from telling something so positive, so it's on them if they turn it negative. I told her that\u2019s not the point, she knows what they\u2019ve been through and she\u2019s being selfish if she actually goes through with that. She cried and claimed I wasn\u2019t being supportive and I shouldn\u2019t be calling my pregnant fiancee selfish. She doesn\u2019t want me to come with her to the wedding anymore either, feeling as if I would \u2018kill the mood\u2019. She hasn\u2019t been talking to me either\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I wouldn\u2019t even do this at the wedding of someone that I *hated.*", "I agree, after the ceremony priest is also fair play.", "\"Yes your honor. I spilled a butcher knife and it got red wine all over her white dress.\"", "The chicken tender salad was so good. Glad I asked for extra ranch on the side!", "It sounds like the fianc\u00e9e is the only one creating the competition though. Some people create competition where there isn\u2019t one. Maybe fianc\u00e9e should get her own hobbies instead of trying to be like her cousin.", "It's ok, you weren't too bad and it was hilarious. She was laughing and having a lot of fun too!", "NTA - but you will be if you allow this to happen. This is a hill to die on IMO. Imagine how this cousin will feel to have her wedding day hijacked by someone stealing the focus to announce a pregnancy, and knowingly rubbing in the fact that she cannot get pregnant (so far), but your fianc\u00e9e can and has. This is not just main character syndrome, this is cruel. If it were me, I\u2019d go nuclear. If she still intends to go through with this, not only would I not go to the wedding, I\u2019d warn a TRUSTED member of their bridal party to intercept your fianc\u00e9e before she ruins this poor couple\u2019s wedding. \n\nPS - I wouldn\u2019t want to marry someone who takes \u201ccompetition\u201d this far. What an incredibly toxic trait. Your fianc\u00e9e is holding a lifelong grudge against her cousin and sees her wedding as the golden opportunity to hit her where it hurts, in more ways than one. Do you want your child to be raised that way?", "Your fianc\u00e9e will straight-up ruin that wedding if she does it. I'm sorry it took until this pregnancy for you to find out your partner is an asshole. I strongly suggest that you let them know what she's planning before the wedding so that they can uninvite her if they want.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour fiance is showing glaring flags.\n\nThink long and hard if you want to tie yourself with someone so jealous and petty. This sort of behavior doesn't just go away or remain focused on 1 person. She might end up like the wife of that 1 Redditor who got sued for harassing an ex-friend from high school and they ended up financially struggling.", "NTA \n\nYour fiance isn't just selfish, she's mean. If I'm understanding correctly, the couple getting married has had problems with infertility and recently lost a child to miscarriage. Your fiance wants to announce that she is now pregnant while at their wedding? The news of her pregnancy would be hard enough for her cousin to hear if they were in a private place. To make this announcement at what should be a happy occasion for the newly married couple is cruel. You mention that she has always felt competitive towards her cousin. This plan shows a deliberate intention to hurt the married couple.\n\nWhy in the world are you planning to raise a child with such a mean person?", "NTA\n\n>She cried and claimed I wasn\u2019t being supportive and I shouldn\u2019t be calling my pregnant fiancee selfish.\n\nTell her that the internet thinks she's a selfish pregnant asshole. \n\nAlso, I'd tell her that if she does it you will think differently of her as a person. And I'd call her mom or dad or someone who you feel might be able to stop her or call her cousin/cousin's fianc\u00e9 and warn them. Your fiancee is not a good person based on the \"not good at everything\" line. That made me want to vomit and broke my heart for her cousin. Please stop her.", "NTA but your fiancee is - massively. Seriously, why are you even with a woman who is so blatantly and unutterably cruel to anyone, let alone her own flesh and blood\\\\? JFC, the woman has had a huge fertility struggle and miscarried an obviously very much wanted child TWO WEEKS AGO and all your fiancee can think about is how to rub her nose in it by 1) upstaging her at her own wedding and gathering all of the attention to herself and 2) 'proving' in the most humiliating and nasty way possible that she is *finally* 'better' at something than her cousin. Hooley Dooley, mate - RUN!!! But not before telling the bride's mother exactly what she is planning to 'surprise' her cousin with at her wedding.", "For, since her own father, who, when he seemed about to recover, suddenly felt the icy black hand of death upon him.", "Yeah, it's potentially a very bad situation for OP. If he takes away her moment of triumph (by warning cousin and getting her banned from the wedding or even by breaking up with her over this), she could redirect that hatred towards him or even hurt their kid to hurt OP. Or worse. She could be harbouring a dangerous amount of hatred that's still sitting properly on the hinges but will go flying off as the situation spirals.", "I thought she was with me at red lobster 3000 miles the other way? Oh well, no one knows where she was exactly so there's your reasonable doubt. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "No, no, no. He has to sign the marriage certificate first.", "All of you are giving me a much needed laugh for this chain of responses \ud83d\ude0a"]}
