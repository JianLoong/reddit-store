We co-parent our 3 children together and there haven\u2019t really been many issues. My ex is getting married to Stephanie. I like Stephanie she has been great with my kids and makes my ex happy. My ex invited me to their wedding and I was happy for him. It was my day with the kids so it made sense for me to come was his reasoning. When I arrived at the wedding Stephanie thanked me for dropping the kids off and brushed me off. We had never had any issues before. \n\nI explained that I was going to stay for the reception and she was very upset. I was confused because I assumed she knew I would be in attendance. It turned out she didn\u2019t consider that I would actually accept the invitation. I told her that I was invited and since I took the 2 hour drive I would be staying for the entire duration. She didn\u2019t like this response. Stephanie asked me to leave and I stood my ground. She went on to complain about my dress upstaging hers. My ex and former mother in law helped her to calm down and the wedding shortly began.\n\nI thought that was the end of it, but later in private Stephanie accused me of trying to ruin her special day. She is convinced that I wanted to show off and make the wedding about my divorce. She said it was rude for me not to leave after the bride requested it because it was her special day. I told her that I am not responsible for her insecurities and once again reminded her that I have no interest in \u201dstealing\u201d my ex back.", "created_utc": 1673033910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1053aix/aita_for_showing_up_at_my_exs_wedding_in_a_pretty/", "score": 683, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My ex invited me to their wedding and I was happy for him. It was my day with the kids so it made sense for me to come was his reasoning. When I arrived at the wedding Stephanie thanked me for dropping the kids off and brushed me off. We had never had any issues before. \n\nI explained that I was going to stay for the reception and she was very upset. I was confused because I assumed she knew I would be in attendance. It turned out she didn\u2019t consider that I would actually accept the invitation. I told her that I was invited and since I took the 2 hour drive I would be staying for the entire duration. She didn\u2019t like this response. Stephanie asked me to leave and I stood my ground. She went on to complain about my dress upstaging hers. My ex and former mother in law helped her to calm down and the wedding shortly began.\n\nI thought that was the end of it, but later in private Stephanie accused me of trying to ruin her special day. She is convinced that I wanted to show off and make the wedding about my divorce. She said it was rude for me not to leave after the bride requested it because it was her special day.

Wedding or not it'd be pretty crappy to take that away from OP. Especially since they'd been invited, RSVP'd, and gotten no pushback prior.", "Normally I don\u2019t care about \u201cdon\u2019t wear red to a wedding because it means you slept with the groom!\u201d Because I think it\u2019s a stupid rule. But wearing a fire engine red dress to your ex\u2019s wedding does seem in poor form.", "NTA. It's incredibly rude to invite someone and then ask them to leave when they show up. Dressing up for a wedding is expected.", "Omg no way", "Yup AND she drove them 2 hours to be there. If you want me to drive two hours to bring the kids to your event and then take them back after of course I'm staying. Assuming they don't want to be looking after the kids on their first night as newlyweds. What did she expect? OP to drive 2 hours there, 2 hours home and then ANOTHER 2 hours there and back to get the kids?", "Well they have children together are divorced so I guess the secrets out.", "Knew it had to be something like that. Sure fire way to change a bride\u2019s opinion of you and whether they want you at the wedding.", "Read the link. It's literally a wedding dress.", "it really does look intentionally provocative. And am I in the only universe where coffee shops exist? She really should have left and just come back for the kids.", "Lol it\u2019s a wedding dress.

That knowledge of that ship sailed a long time ago.", ">red dress at a wedding means you've slept with the groom\n\nIs this like \"if they wink at you and rotate 3 times around you it means they want to kill you\"?", "I think maybe this depends on your location.  I\u2019m in the Midwest area of the US, and I\u2019ve only seen this mentioned on Reddit.  At least here it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to wear red to a wedding.  Also: it just occurred to me that red was one of my colors so all of my bridesmaids wore red. Pretty funny in this context.", "I mean... it's her ex,  so that's very likely the case", "I\u2019ve literally NEVER heard that before \ud83d\ude33 (west coast USA)", "She\u2019s his ex, there with their kids. That she slept with him is hardly a secret.", "I live in the PNW, and have never heard this. Its very common to wear red to weddings here. It probably depends on the predominant culture/ location.", "And I don't even want to get into what a brown dress means.", "When my mom got remarried, my sister (her bio daughter) wore a red dress. I assure you she did NOT sleep with our stepdad, and both sides of the family come from very different cultural backgrounds. \n\nCan you explain in which culture this is the case?", "Says who?", "My mom wore red to my wedding so this made me laugh (I helped picked the dress out!). I\u2019ve never heard of that here in the upper Midwest", "So does bringing your shared children lol. The color of the dress is not the issue here.", "I was not aware of that. I didn\u2019t know of this connotation. That changes a lot and helps me understand her views on the dress a bit.", "I think, since they have three kids together who were at the wrdding, it would be obvious that she slept with the groom.", "I think everyone knows that the ex slept with OP", "The bride saying that she \"didn't expect OP to actually accept the invitation\" implies that she knew about it the invite, went along with it without argument or communication, and is now mad that OP isnt a mind reader.", "[Ask and ye shall receive](https://www.reddit.com/user/closureseekingex/comments/1054eq8/the_dress_was_similar_to_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)", "Do you have the post? I sana read it!", "She posted a picture she said it was similar too. It\u2019s listed as a wedding dress on Amazon, just comes in red as one of the options. It was basically a red version of a wedding dress.", "A red lacy dress does not compare to a white wedding dress, be real.", "it\u2019s definitely different for different cultures, not something i\u2019d personally consider but given that OP essentially wore a red wedding dress, i\u2019d say their intent was somewhat clear.", "Same. I usually do red or black for events like weddings. I guess I can understand the black, but I don't accessorize when going to a funeral where, as for a wedding, it's more glitz and glam", "I definitely sympathize! Maybe the ex should have just swapped days with OP so the kids could attend his wedding. I also have to wonder why the bride didn't say anything after OP RSVP'd yes. Very weird overall.\n\nBut still, if the bride was insisting she didn't want me at a wedding, I just can't imagine putting my foot down about staying. Maybe it's the people pleaser in me that hates confrontation, but it sounds like a recipe for an awkward and unhappy day.", "Is don\u2019t wear red really a thing?  Good lord I never knew that!!", "I'm wondering if the bride didn't know she was invited. It hasn't been said, but it's possible ex texted OP and she just responded similarly. Or the bride just didn't see her name on the list, especially if there were a lot of people invited.", "Especially after OP drove 2 hours to be there and was presumably going to have to come back to collect the kids. If they didn\u2019t want her there they shouldn\u2019t have invited her.", "I do think an important question here is what was OP wearing? I agree that inviting and rescinding is unacceptable (although weird how this message got lost if OP RSVPd)\n\nBut the worry about being hostage? OP what was your dress? I\u2019m assuming it wasn\u2019t white/smarter than the dress code/in anyway bridal?", "Yep. OP actually cast the 1st stone here, whether they see that or not.", "Yeah the dress made me change my vote to AH.", "Oh damn. \n\nYTA OP. That\u2019s a wedding dress", "Oh crap.

That\u2019s why I wore a red one for my brother\u2019s wedding. /s\n\nUnless it was a skin tight dress or really low cut, a red dress isn\u2019t that bad.

I mean if she rsvp yes. How can you think she wouldn't attend.\n\n\nNah as if the bride was so anti, basically yelling at her I would have gone shopping to kill time.\n\n\nI do think the bride messed up.

Do you still think her dress choice wasn\u2019t intentional?\n\nI\u2019m not trying to change your mind, just genuinely curious :)", "Quite the devilish little detail, isn't it?", "I kinda wanna do the same. I wonder if there's another color that implies things. Blue because we went swimming once with the groom?", "Honestly, she's there with 3 kids from the groom. She doesn't need more proof.", "Well now that I\u2019m thinking about it my husband has mentioned several times my mom moving in with or closer to us\u2026. Maybe I should be worried!! Lmao", "she removed the link lol", "She\u2019s posted a similar dress if you\u2019re interested. \n\nSomeone found the dress she posted listed on Amazon as a red wedding dress.", "This hyper focus on the dress is misdirection. Clearly the bride had an issue with her groom\u2019s EX being at her wedding, and you\u2019re all easily accepting of that, when this is very clearly a situation where the MOTHER OF THE GROOM\u2019s CHILDREN RSVP\u2019d ahead of time and attended the wedding with her children. For a bride to lose her mind over this and claim being upstaged is so plausible.", "Yeah, fair enough.
