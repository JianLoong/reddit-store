{"id": 6649, "submission_id": "1053aix", "title": "AITA for showing up at my ex\u2019s wedding in a pretty dress?", "selftext": "My ex and I had an peaceful divorce. We co-parent our 3 children together and there haven\u2019t really been many issues. My ex is getting married to Stephanie. I like Stephanie she has been great with my kids and makes my ex happy. My ex invited me to their wedding and I was happy for him. It was my day with the kids so it made sense for me to come was his reasoning. When I arrived at the wedding Stephanie thanked me for dropping the kids off and brushed me off. We had never had any issues before.\n\nI explained that I was going to stay for the reception and she was very upset. I was confused because I assumed she knew I would be in attendance. It turned out she didn\u2019t consider that I would actually accept the invitation. I told her that I was invited and since I took the 2 hour drive I would be staying for the entire duration. She didn\u2019t like this response. Stephanie asked me to leave and I stood my ground. She went on to complain about my dress upstaging hers. My ex and former mother in law helped her to calm down and the wedding shortly began.\n\nI thought that was the end of it, but later in private Stephanie accused me of trying to ruin her special day. She is convinced that I wanted to show off and make the wedding about my divorce. She said it was rude for me not to leave after the bride requested it because it was her special day. I told her that I am not responsible for her insecurities and once again reminded her that I have no interest in \u201dstealing\u201d my ex back.\n\nEdit: the dress is posted on my page and since this is a throwaway i don\u2019t remember the random password i typed up. i will also be active on u/closureseekingex2", "created_utc": 1673033910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1053aix/aita_for_showing_up_at_my_exs_wedding_in_a_pretty/", "score": 4587, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Choosing to die on a hill of staying because you drove is not the best move. It basically screams main character, and you could have left that at home for the day\n5. Being told to leave sucks and it is unfair, since the root of the problem is the miscommunication of the couple, but you should have, when one of the hosts asked you to.

We co-parent our 3 children together and there haven\u2019t really been many issues. My ex is getting married to Stephanie. I like Stephanie she has been great with my kids and makes my ex happy. My ex invited me to their wedding and I was happy for him. It was my day with the kids so it made sense for me to come was his reasoning. When I arrived at the wedding Stephanie thanked me for dropping the kids off and brushed me off. We had never had any issues before. \n\nI explained that I was going to stay for the reception and she was very upset. I was confused because I assumed she knew I would be in attendance. It turned out she didn\u2019t consider that I would actually accept the invitation. I told her that I was invited and since I took the 2 hour drive I would be staying for the entire duration. She didn\u2019t like this response. Stephanie asked me to leave and I stood my ground. She went on to complain about my dress upstaging hers. My ex and former mother in law helped her to calm down and the wedding shortly began.\n\nI thought that was the end of it, but later in private Stephanie accused me of trying to ruin her special day. She is convinced that I wanted to show off and make the wedding about my divorce. She said it was rude for me not to leave after the bride requested it because it was her special day.

It\u2019s the perfect amount of vintage without looking dated, thanks for finding it \ud83d\ude02", "Eh, floor length is fine but in muted colors or floral as you mentioned.", "Wait you\u2019re not allowed to wear full length gowns because you\u2019re an ex? Wild.", "Those are all really nice dresses. You have good taste.", "Look at you with your appropriate attire! How will you be able to make a scene at your ex\u2019s wedding dressed like that??", "\n\nUpvote just for the Scarlett O'Hara reference.", "> hoping everyone would think: he left HER?!\n\nOh, they did, but the full thought was likely more along the lines of, \"**It's no wonder** he left *her*.\"", "OP says she \"likes\" Stephanie, but I'm calling BS.  If a woman I only tolerated neutrally was distressed by my presence at her wedding, I would apologize and take myself to a restaurant and movie instead.\n\nI cannot fathom the petty vindictiveness that would make me STAY where I wasn't wanted.", "There was one a little while ago where a woman asked if she was TA for not cancelling her vacation with friends. Her boyfriend had suddenly cancelled his trip with them, and he had asked her to cancel too and stay back with him, and had gotten upset when she said no and went to party with her friends.\n\nThen someone asked why he had cancelled. He had just been diagnosed with a serious form of cancer and was setting up chemotherapy treatments. He wanted his long term girlfriend with him for emotional support.", "Exactly. It sounds more like the bride has a communication problem with the groom, which 100% isn't OP'a fault", "Yeah, I also wore a white floor-length dress, not with a train, but with a white tulle cape, and this was more of a wedding dress than mine too.", "Doesn\u2019t matter how formal. Doesn\u2019t even matter the dress although that was over the top AH behavior. She knew the bride, could have told her she was coming and is it ok to wear a bright red form fitting wedding dress (ffs if you need to ask you shouldn\u2019t attend weddings), and besides, when you show up and clearly are upsetting the bride on her wedding day DONT HANG AROUND", "I get what you\u2019re saying, but OP took it beyond formal.  Also, I have to laugh now, because up until recently I had heard this. But there was a post recently where the bride went insane because the grooms sister wore red to her wedding and the bride went off because red is the color a woman who has banged the groom wears to a wedding. I thought it was insane at the time, but OP did it! She wore red to the wedding of a guy she banged.", "I've never heard of it until recently. Seems like people just make shit up sometimes. I did read it somewhere and thought it was interesting. Who the hell knows anymore.", "And who was supposed to look after the kids when she left? This weird me out that no one thought about that.", "It\u2019s not really a thing in the southern white culture I grew up in. BUT since it\u2019s a \u201cloud\u201d color it is kinda considered in poor taste as it can drag attention away from the brides dress and put it on yours. I also had black friends tell me what it meant to them years ago, so have always just avoided it for weddings. You\u2019ll see me in black at a wedding before red", "What makes it even worse to me is that in the past few years, a lot of people have assigned a meaning to wearing red to a wedding - that you have had sex with the groom. While its obvious OP has, its still... a bad choice, to say the least.", "A white one actually would have been less noticeable than this bright red one.", "Do we know that OP is in the northern hemisphere? Could be middle of summer in Australia too", "I think I read it on here somewhere. probably bad information,but wear a red wedding dress to a wedding and claiming innocence is goofy", "I went to an ex\u2019s wedding in another state halfway across the country with a plus one.   I thought if you\u2019re invited to a wedding you\u2019re supposed to show up with a nice gift so off I went.  No one told me about pity-please-don\u2019t-come-invitations.  But I was genuinely happy for him and interested in keeping in touch so long as it was a light touch.  Pretty much everything about that trip was a mistake, including reconnecting.  But that plus one is now my husband and he tells the story fondly as an example of these trips we go on where everything goes wrong.", "When my husband and I got married, my stepdaughter was the flower girl. Hubby\u2019s ex-wife wasn\u2019t invited because reasons, but she stayed for the wedding and reception along with her husband and their two children. I thought it was weird af.", "I agree, assuming the ex hadn\u2019t turned up in a red wedding dress, it would be rude of the bride to ask her to leave once she\u2019d arrived.  She was asked to leave a private event and refused.  I wouldn\u2019t want to be somewhere I wasn\u2019t welcome by the hosts.  If OP has the guts to drive 2 hrs & rock up to someone else\u2019s wedding in a wedding dress, she\u2019ll manage to hang out in a restaurant in it for a while until the kids are ready for home. \ud83d\ude02", ">Well, she also said that it was a 2-hour drive to the venue and the bride apparently knew her fiance had invited her because she said the bride just didn't think she'd come\n\nIt's possible the bride is also TA, and thought that OP would make a 4-hour round-trip to bring the kids without herself attending.", "Really?! I wore a red dress to my cousin\u2019s wedding in 1993.  Gross \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Nah, I thought it looked very bride-lije before I read the description.", "Oh yeah, a dress in the style of the one in the links here is absolutely asking for trouble, it\u2019s totally attention-seeking.", "I guess, now that I think about it, in my case it was pretty clear it was a courtesy invitation. I didn't receive an actual paper invitation but a *verbal* invitation as my son's dad was picking him up a few days before the wedding. lol. I was just like thank you for the invite, I appreciate it, but I probably won't be able to make it. \n\nStill, even with a paper invitation, I think a bride usually doesn't really want the stepkid's mom there unless she's genuinely friends with her... and that is rare.", "That was my though- OP was almost certainly pretty extra with the dress she chose, but it also sounds like the her ex either communicated super poorly to his fianc\u00e9/now wife or they\u2019re all just ridiculous for expecting OP to drive 4+ hours just to drop kids off as a favor to the ex for a day.", "Every single one of my bridesmaids wore red.", "I wore a black dress with white embroidery to my cousins wedding over a decade ago. I sincerely didn't know the rule about wearing black. It was just my best dress I had back then as new adult.", "I always assumed that wearing a red dress at a wedding meant you were having sex with a groomsman later.", "Wearing that she definitely stuck out.", "Personally, I wouldn\u2019t have wasted the paper and ink to invite someone I didn\u2019t actually want to come.  But then personally, my wedding had 25 guests.", "The LBD is extremely popular to wear to things like weddings. There's some people/areas that have beliefs like that but ime most people are ok with wearing black to a wedding. In fact I don't think I've ever been to a wedding that didn't have multiple men and women wearing black.", "There's a rule about wearing black to weddings? I thought it was OK? Of course I'd never heard the red thing before either (still not convinced that's actually a thing)", "I was 19 at the time. Everyone in the wedding party was family. Honestly I\u2019ve been laughing about this for ages now. lol", "If I was truly happy for my ex and his new wife, I'd dress way down. Like sit me with the frumpy aunts down. Like you have to know you're basically being tolerated as a guest on your ex's wedding day for the sake of the kids."]}
