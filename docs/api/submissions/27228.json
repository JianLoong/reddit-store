Even before we had our son, my husbands sister (Mary, 33F), whom I\u2019ve only met once in person for just a couple minutes where nothing happened, has had it out for blood for me. Apparently she\u2019s been this way towards every woman he\u2019s ever been with, with her justifying her actions as an \u201coverprotective sister who will always see him as an awkward teenage boy who always chooses the wrong girls\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to talk to her, but she never responds to me, claiming I shouldn\u2019t be talking for my husband. Im blocked at every corner. She has called me a pathological liar, a narcissist, \u201cnothing more than a surrogate womb\u201d, that she can\u2019t be in the same room as me, , would \u201ctake me outside\u201d if she ever saw me in person, and that if I respected her and truly wanted her to have a relationship with my son, I would stay home for every family event. It truly makes me scratch my head because I\u2019ve literally begged this person to talk to me about what issues she has with me, I\u2019ve been with her brother for over 6 years. The rest of their siblings say to never expect a response nor an apology, that she\u2019s never apologized for anything in her life. Even on Christmas, the gift she got for their dad didn\u2019t work and the first thing everyone else said was to NOT tell her or she\u2019ll throw a temper tantrum. \n\nProblem is, we live 4 hours away and my son hasn\u2019t been away from me for that long. Not even for a date night. So for the first time this weekend, my husband told me to stay home and relax and have a weekend to myself. It also happened to be the weekend of Mary\u2019s son (husbands nephew) birthday party. I made it very clear beforehand I do not want my son around someone who openly hates me so much and has threatened me. I explained I don\u2019t mind if he sees his nephew cuz I know how much he must miss him. My husband and son went without telling me, and he wasn\u2019t planning on telling me. I told him we were gonna have a talk about our relationship when he got home. \n\nMy husband can do what he wants at the end of the day and I do want him to have a relationship with his nephew. Where I draw the line is him bringing my son after I explicitly said I do not want him around her until I can get a guarantee made that she won\u2019t say anything negative about me around him. She doesn\u2019t even have to say it to me, she could say it to my husband or my MIL. If she thinks she can do and say anything she wants around anyone with no repercussions, who\u2019s to say what she will say around/to my son? At the same time, I feel extremely disrespected. If I can\u2019t trust him not to take him around someone I don\u2019t want while we\u2019re married, how can I do it if we ever make the decision to split up?\n\n\nAITA for being upset that my husband took my son around his sister who has threatened me after I told him not to?

Have a very serious conversation about your relationship once he gets home. Also if you have dates documented, that will work in your favor.", "NTA. Your husband was dishonest, and it doesn't sound like he's done a good job of standing up for you with his sister.", "NTA\n\nHowever, your husband will never listen or agree with you. He proved this by taking your son without consent or knowledge. Just know this.", "NTA.\n\nHusband should cut all contact with sister if she treats you that way.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t he is allowing that and thinks it\u2019s ok.  That is a huge red flag, it\u2019s abhorrent his family dynamic accepts this crap.", "NTA.  You definitely need to have that relationship talk.  Taking your son to this party behind your back KNOWING how you feel is NOT how a husband should behave.  And you're right - I wouldn't want my son around somebody like this at all and I'm not sure why your husband is okay with it.", "NTA but the issue is your husband cannot be trusted.\n\nHis sister is not a safe person for your child to be around if she hates you that deeply. But your husband has behaved very badly here.", "NTA\nHe should have shut that shit down, but it's obvious his parents have taught him it's normal and she is a golden princess who doesn't get to face consequences.\n\nNot only that, but he lied to you and did what you told him not to. Ask him what would have happened if she openly threatened or physically attacked your son? She may not seem like it but she could flip a switch at any moment, she's already been taught she can say what she wants, what if she tries out punishing your son for his and your existence.\n\nHe needs to support you keep you both safe, not put your son's mental and emotional state at risk because of what he wants. You even told him he can go, but just not your son.", "When you file for divorce I would explicitly say the interactions with the sister led to marriage breakdown. \n\nNTA", "NTA but your husband is a huge one, he deliberately deceived you took this child around a woman that sounds unhinged and intended to not tell you. I would not trust her around anyone, especially a child, if she's threatening violence. You should probably start documenting her behavior if you haven't already.", "Yta because you're with a man who can't stand up to his sister. Seriously your husband is a huge a hole. \n\nWhen you get a divorce, be sure to record and document everything she's said to you, because you'll want to bring this up as a potential parental alienation issue. If anyone allows her to bad mouth you in front of your child, you have rights.", "NTA, because he intended to deceive you.\n\nBut this sounds like it would have been an event with a number of family members present, adult and children. Going forward, you have a good case to insist that Mary is never alone with your son. But as long as her weirdness is only verbal, you shouldn't be insisting that your son can never be at _any_ family event where Mary will also be. That potentially isolates your son from half his family and reduces the connections and love he would get from that side - and that's wrong.", "NTA. Carry mace", "NTA - Mary sounds like a psycho. I wouldn't want my kids around Mary and I don't even know her. I would simply refuse for your son to be around Mary - period.", "NTA with a caveat: you married a man that has a sibling that has actively hated you from day 1 and his family enables it. Y T A to yourself and even if your husband up until now was an amazing partner (doubtful at this point) you would\u2019ve saved yourself so much pain and heartache had you not married the man. Because most of the time, you\u2019re not marrying just someone alone; they come with a whole ass family that can either make or break a relationship down the line. Unless they\u2019re NC/LC. \n\nToo many stories on this sub (fake or not) revolve around men and women marrying a partner that won\u2019t ever stand up for them against a horrible family. How many hours and years of a pain free existence would be so prominent if people wouldn\u2019t marry someone that comes from a questionable family. \n\nOP I\u2019ve read some of your comments. You seem to love some ILs yet they enable one that actively despises you and has you feeling threatened. They tell you to ignore this SIL and they spend soooooooo much time trying not to set her off. This is just unhealthy all around and so much energy wasted on people who don\u2019t deserve. I hope you stand up for your child at some point and yourself. No one deserves this much negativity and eggshell life.", "When you file for divorce I would explicitly say the interactions with the sister led to marriage breakdown. \n\nNTA", "YTA\n\nShe doesn't like you. She's obviously never harmed anyone in the family. You need to be less controlling.
