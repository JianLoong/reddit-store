I was a groomsmen in their wedding and I am the godfather of both boys, and was asked to be before both were born. \n\nI(36m) have a long time friend(34f) who I live about 4 blocks from. We have always been very close. \n\nHer husband passed away 3 years ago after a 9 month battle with brain cancer, during which she was his full time care taker. \n\nI was also very close with her husband and since I lived close by I would go over and help as much as I could, be it cooking, cleaning, taking the kids out to do things, yard work and maintenance around the house, especially as he declined and required round the clock care.\n\n After he passed I have continued to help my friend and her kids, and I spend a lot of time with her kids (now 11 and 9m).\n\nLast year I married my wife, who I started dating after my friends husband had passed, so this isnt new. \n\nSince then, there have been consistent arguments about me performing \"husband duties\" for my friend. Some examples of the things she was upset about:\n\n My friend called because when she woke up\na pipe had burst in the ceiling and she couldn't find a plumber who could come out that day (I'm a contractor so I was able to call a friend and he went over asap) and then I headed over and helped her clean up the mess and helped her with talking to her insurance and hiring a remediation company. After that was done I helped her demo and replace the dry wall. \n\nHer car broke down, so I picked her kids up from school and went and played basketball with them while she got it to the shop and grabbed a rental, and then the boys wanted to have a pizza party, so we grabbed some pizzas and had dinner at the park. \n\nShe was relandscaping her backyard and putting in some raised planter beds and I went over on my day off to help her. \n\nMy wife is always welcome, she doesn't usually want to go and instead thinks I should let her figure it out because \"she's a big girl and she needs to stop acting like I'm her husband\". She has even gone as far as suggesting that my friend wants to steal me away from my wife because she needs someone to take care of her.", "created_utc": 1682287658, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ws2aj/aita_for_doing_husband_duties_for_my_friend/", "score": 751, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have a friend who does similar things for me since my husband died and I know that he's trying to look out for me because he was my husband's best friend.  I really appreicate his help but I would draw the line at inviting him to stay for pizza or hang out with my kids in case his wife (who is a really cool person) thought it was too much.  If your wife is starting to feel uncomfortable then you need to dial it back a bit. Save your help for the big things like major DIY and keep up with your friend socially by inviting her over to your place to hang out with you and your wife together.", "Look, your wife is telling you flat out she feels less cared for and taken care of than the other woman.

What if her new husband feels the same as your wife?", "Helping out a good friend and looking after her kids who you presumably like, are hallmarks of a great friend. Try to determine what is driving your wife's objection. Are you neglecting similar tasks at home? Are you neglecting domestic chores including cooking and cleaning at home? Are you spending more than 1/3 of your free time helping your friend? (It's hard to tell whether she's seeking your help daily, weekly or monthly.) Emergencies aside, do you mostly catch up within a regular, predictable, window of time or is it irregular and or unpredictable? Does your wife object to all of the assistance, or the amount and frequency of assistance?\n\nDid you give your wife any reason to think that you wouldn't continue being part of that family's life after you married? What was she hoping for?\n\nIt seems pretty clear that your wife is jealous of the time you spend with your friend and her family. This does not mean that you are neglecting your home life (although you might be), or that you are doing anything \"wrong\". \"Now that you are married it is time to stop helping that family [who will continue to need help]\" is borderline controlling and not a lot different from \"now that you are married it is time to stop working/hobby/sport.\" You're NTA for consistently being a supportive and helpful friend. However, you've made a commitment to your wife and the very least you owe her is to understand her objection and to try to meet any needs she doesn't feel you're meeting. This may include creating boundaries with your friend around what kinds of emergencies are okay to call about after dark.", "INFO: do you do all these \u201chusband\u201d things for your wife?

I say that because there have been many very reasonable comments posted here and I haven\u2019t seen a single one that asked you to go no contact with the boys or your friend, but you have shown no acceptance of any type of compromise or any validation whatsoever of your wife\u2019s feelings.\nYou simply came here for validation that you are right and she is wrong. \nThat says to me that you value your second family over her.", "Soft YTA I don\u2019t think your wife is crazy to say that your spending a lot of time with them and helping them a lot. Clearly this is your dynamic but I am curious why your wife didn\u2019t realize this before. It sounds like you need to work on your marriage to figure this out. Even if your wife is jealous, why does she feel this way ? Do you want to stay married and figure it out or is her questioning it too much and you want to break up", "Soft YTA. I get why your wife is feeling uncomfortable. It's because those are exactly things you should/could be doing at home and you're doing it in a \"second\" home but WITHOUT her. \n\nI disagree with the comments here saying your wife is insecure. Why wouldn't she be when you spend a chunk of your free time with a second family without her? \n\nI understand you're only trying to help. I think the best recourse would be to involve her more so she feels more comfortable. Treat your friend as a true sister, invite her family over, go out with the entire gang. \n\nYou're doing a good thing but make sure it isn't at the expense of your own family.", "YTA. Big time!

He left his wife who put him through uni and married the widow.", "NAH\n\nIt's great that you're connecting with your godsons, but it might be time to renegotiate boundaries. Your wife feels sidelined, as others have said.\n\nInstead of spending \"family time\" at their house, maybe take the boys out every week or two? Then there's no confusion that you're being slotted into the \"husband\" role at their house. Helping in an emergency (like a burst pipe) is different than doing gardening, which she could do herself. And going over for a bbq with just you and the family definitely strays into the \"husband\" role.\n\nYou need a plan for when you have your own children--this much time with her children isn't really sustainable when that happens.\n\nAnd you need to make sure you're spending a lot of quality time with you wife--she is your immediate family.\n\nYou need to decide what your priority is--if you want to be with your wife, she is not happy with the current state of affairs, and you'll need to compromise. If your priority is the other family, you have your answer (and your wife was right).", "ESH. It is really nice that you help your friend out with these things and it is mean for your wife to have a problem with it when her and her children have obviously been through a lot. Bit much of her to be saying she\u2019s trying to steal you away. Your wife does have a point though that it has been 3 years and she can\u2019t just rely on you for everything and she is going to have to figure out how to do life on her own and deal with emergencies. It is not your place to be that person she calls.", "YTA", "INFO: what is your home vs help division?

Why do you have to hang out at the friend's house if you're mostly there for the boys? Why don't you bring them to your house weekly? Have pizza with them and your wife? I can see why she'd be feeling left out and even jealous.\n\nThe boys are getting older, they may want to spend less time with you, and more with their friends.

To be blunt, she not doing that now. Three years is a long time to be so involved in the day to day running of their household. Emergencies, absolutely help out. Daily cooking, cleaning duties, house projects? That\u2019s too much. Doesn\u2019t she have family who can help?

I am not religious and I don\u2019t miss my church, but one of the best things about it was the few times I remember a husband/father in the congregation passing, the men who were close to him would get to together and make a plan for helping the widow and kids and making sure all the husband/dad duties got done. From yard work to coaching the kids soccer teams. Obviously that is really reductive in terms of gender roles and I have issues there, but the point is the community stoped up. Not everyone has a community like that to lean on. You\u2019re doing the right the thing and your wife should view it as evidence of how good a man she has.", "NTA\n\nI genuinely don't understand the redditors posting the YTA response.", "NTA your friend lost her husband in a really traumatic way not that long ago.

But TA for \"taking over husbandly duties\" for another woman. Yes, your wife knew all of this before you were married, but your wife probably expected you to spend less time with the other woman after you were married.

You're to be commended for your commitment and loyalty for sure, but your attitude to your wife, who probably feels like an outsider, is a little mean. \n\nIs not insecure to expect to be a priority.

You're doing the right thing with your friend by supporting her and family in times of need.  It's the right thing to do, and to ignore that would be wrong.  But, you need to be addressing your wife's needs too.  She is feeling jealous, insecure, and expressing needs that aren't being met.  You can't ignore that for being the righteous helping friend.   You need to always put your wife first.  Misc examples:   If you and your wife are having dinner or spending time with family that day, and your friend comes second, the next day, or that weekend.  If you haven't seen your wife much this week because of mutual work-- your friend can't make a request of you--- your wife comes first in this priority list.  BUT, you let your friend know you'll have more time \\_\\_\\_\\_ and will come by then.   And for every X times you're helping your friend out during an especially busy week, you'd better be doing twice as much for your own family and wife.  If everything seems under control at home, maybe just ask you wife--- \"hey, is there anything you want done around here this weekend, I have some free time?\".   I think just shifting some of your attention to the home front might help the situation. \n\nI also agree with some of the other comments-- have the boys over for pizza at your house instead on some occasion.  Maybe you + your wife cook for them all and you jointly host them.  Anything social should \\*always\\* have an invite for her-- if she wants to skip, that's cool.  If it seems odd, \"hey we're playing in the park for 2 hours, come stop by\", doesn't matter--- just invite.  \n\n I do not think your wife has the right to entirely cut you off from helping the friend though, that isn't healthy for her to ask.", "NTA.

We have always been very close. \n\nHer husband passed away 3 years ago after a 9 month battle with brain cancer, during which she was his full time care taker. \n\nI was also very close with her husband and since I lived close by I would go over and help as much as I could, be it cooking, cleaning, taking the kids out to do things, yard work and maintenance around the house, especially as he declined and required round the clock care.\n\n After he passed I have continued to help my friend and her kids, and I spend a lot of time with her kids (now 11 and 9m).\n\nLast year I married my wife, who I started dating after my friends husband had passed, so this isnt new. \n\nSince then, there have been consistent arguments about me performing \"husband duties\" for my friend. Some examples of the things she was upset about:\n\n My friend called because when she woke up\na pipe had burst in the ceiling and she couldn't find a plumber who could come out that day (I'm a contractor so I was able to call a friend and he went over asap) and then I headed over and helped her clean up the mess and helped her with talking to her insurance and hiring a remediation company. After that was done I helped her demo and replace the dry wall. \n\nHer car broke down, so I picked her kids up from school and went and played basketball with them while she got it to the shop and grabbed a rental, and then the boys wanted to have a pizza party, so we grabbed some pizzas and had dinner at the park. \n\nShe was relandscaping her backyard and putting in some raised planter beds and I went over on my day off to help her. \n\nMy wife is always welcome, she doesn't usually want to go and instead thinks I should let her figure it out because \"she's a big girl and she needs to stop acting like I'm her husband\". She has even gone as far as suggesting that my friend wants to steal me away from my wife because she needs someone to take care of her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is unreasonable, in my opinion, for your wife to expect you to cease contact with or largely limit your relationship with your friend and her children.
