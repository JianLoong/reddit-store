I said I dont plan to do so, and that we want to raise V with the intention\u00a0 that she could decide by herself\u00a0 what she wants to belive in.

Seems like your partner is the AH for even entertaining the idea of a paternity test. Your partner is the one responsible for sharing to his family that you don\u2019t plan on converting, and how you plan on raising the baby. It\u2019s _his_ family - that burden shouldn\u2019t fall on you. Seems like your partner just doesn\u2019t know how to stand up to his family.", "I say NTA. He should have stuck up for you instead of trying to pacify his family. And if he\u2019s so embarrassed about you having most of the finances then maybe he should do something about that. Get a job that pays more or whatnot. And if that is not feasible now, then he needs to give your the credit you deserve and not bow down to some fucked up patriarchy.", "NTA. He didn't defend you from his family. I get telling lies to prevent family from pestering you, but these need to be communicated clearly and between the two of you. And of course, you need to be sure those are lies (paternity test, you converting to Islam...) - are you sure this is not something that J actually wants to do?", "NTA. I think you should seriously reconsider marrying into this family. This is just a TASTE of what life would be like. And a family with paternalistic views towards women when you have a baby daughter? Fuck that. I'd cut J out immediately and file for full custody. Otherwise you may lose your baby forever. \n\nYou need to realize something here too. J has almost certainly been telling his family lies about a) him supporting you financially and b) that he's told them he's going to \"convince\" you to convert, and almost certainly going to make you raise your baby Muslim. And maybe worse lies too, and they massively insulted YOU by saying the baby didn't look like his. You really want that life?", "NTA.   I personally LOVE the way you defended yourself.  But there are serious red flags in this situation.\n\n1)  Why did your future husband not defend you?  That's his family, HIS job to check them when they get out of line.  \n\n2)  It never, ever works if there is a difference of religion or politics.\n\nYou've got at least 2 very good reasons not to marry \"J\" as that will definitely be your first divorce within a few years.  The tragedy is, you two have already reproduced, which means your child is (one way or the other) going to end up in a single parent household.", "NTA- the fact that he agreed to the paternity test would have been enough for me to leave. \nHe's never going to have your back.", "NTA - okay what you said wasn't great but he allowed his family to interrogate you and agreed to a paternity test?

The number of horror stories of women and their children being trapped in these patriarchal countries or women being allowed to leave but only without their child makes it a stereotype.  He\u2019s already proven he will not go against his family for you.", "NTA. He shouldn't placate his family with falsehoods, especially at your expense. You are the mother of his child. His family should respect you, and he should enforce that. He needs to grow up.", "NTA. Just run", "NTA. But this dude needs to be ex-fianc\u00e9. He did not defend you. He did not help you, and he also doubled down to appease them. Where did the information that you are living in his house come  from? Think about it.\n\nDon't marry this man. Maybe he is just waiting for marriage to force you into all things he just said he would. Especially if you are the main breadwinner.", "NTA\nThey need to back ALL the way off.\n\nYour child, and your beliefs are your business. I'd rethink marrying into that family.", "I don't know how committed his family and his relatives are but i think you should be careful because some Albanians have a really old-school perspective about family honor and reputation and sometimes take it to the extreme. Just saying, for your own safety.", "Time to dump J, pity you had V before J showed his true colours. No therapy is going to fix that.\nNTA", "NTA. But one of your comments below has me worried. You stated you all are actually in love and didn\u2019t explain why he is financially struggling. Which is your business.

Your daughter will not be raised by you unfortunately if you don\u2019t put up boundaries now.

He may believe he will force you to convert once married.", "I always find it amazing that people who seem to not be fluent in English end up having an extremely witty username.", "NTA.  This whole situation became a train wreck the second they questioned your child\u2019s paternity.  I would have left then.  And I would have left your asshole fianc\u00e9 there with them since he\u2019s a coward who couldn\u2019t be bothered to have a spine of his own. Good for you for correcting the blatant misinformation.   Now do yourself a favor: re-evaluate this relationship and don\u2019t go back over there.", "NTA but you'd be an idiot to marry him.

How do they even know about anything concerning private things between bf/gf. I honestly would run as fast as you can from this family.
