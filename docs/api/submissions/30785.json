Ive met a few people that shared this story with me and to them its like loosing a family member. Sure I dont cry about my dead mom every day anymore but that doenst mean I dont miss her and I certainly wouldnt like to be reminded in such a disrespectful way. So I have reason to doubt, that thats a fair expectation.", "My father was so used to calling me by the shortned form of my name that he forgot what the long one was, and that I was named after his own mother.", "U would be surprised by the amt of stuff father's don't remember", "Yes. 100%.", "I've known of a person who was the fifth child with the name.", "I think that went on quite a lot generations ago, when child mortality was high. My grand mother was the oldest of 4, when I was doing ancestry research a few years ago, nan was the second eldest of 8. Nans younger sister had the same name as a sister born between them, who died at childbirth.", "That's so cringeworthy.", "\u2026what exactly led you to believe the mom is unstable? Because I don\u2019t see anything about the mom in the post other than saying her *dead child is a painful memory for her*. This might be the biggest reach I\u2019ve seen in a Reddit comment to date.", "Hey is your keyboard broken?\n\nShould we start a fund me to get you a keyboard with vowels?", "If you want my honest opinion, I find the way you talk embarrassing.\n\nFrom your username I presume you were born in 1982. I was born close to that year.\n\nWhat do you think I've done that you disagree with?\n\nA one word comment means you can appeal to everyone without having any convictions.", "I think you\u2019re just not getting the context. No one is claiming that the name is actually cursed. They\u2019re telling OP to say that to possibly scare dad\u2019s girlfriend out of using that name.", "I genuinely have questions. OF COURSE names do not work like that and people with all sorts of names die every day. It\u2019s not the fact, the point is that some names, books, places, movies, songs, colours, etc become meaningful to us from past experiences. This is the case here. Do you genuinely do not understand that? Or are you a troll yourself?", "There\u2019s no way the new partner doesn\u2019t know the story.", "Ha! TY. My husband once told me it was my Indian name. \ud83d\ude02 Non PC now, I know, but it was cute/funny at the time.", "You are welcome!", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd72", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02 mmmmm sure. I have never forgotten my children, particularly the two I have lost I hold very close to me.", "Really, first day? This wasn't a dead child. This was a pregnancy loss. I've had miscarriages. Most women have.  If OP is angry with their father for divorcing, remarriage, and impregnating within a year, that's justified. But misrepresenting a 20 year old miscarriage to sound like a brother who was born, created memories, and died is gross.", "Seriously?", ">possibly scare dad\u2019s girlfriend out of using that name.\n\nWhy would they do that?\n\nI'm more confused now. Is scaring people ia n clandestine way acceptable now?", "Damn. I hope you're alright now!", "You have no idea what it was, it could have been a stillbirth. And either way, the mom would still be allowed to be upset about it. You\u2019re not the grief police and nothing in this post indicates that the mother is unstable. Just because *you* didn\u2019t feel pain at your miscarriages doesn\u2019t mean no one else is allowed too. \n\nYou\u2019re literally making up the story. It\u2019s one thing to say we don\u2019t have enough information but to say that the mom is *unstable* based off this information we do have is ridiculous.", "Did you swap keyboards?", "Because it\u2019s absolutely in poor as shit taste to name a new baby after a dead one. It\u2019s shitting on the memory of the dead child and it\u2019s a slap in the fact to both Op and ops mom. \n\nIt\u2019s it cool to do? No. But neither is what their doing. Sometimes, when people play dirty, you have to too.", "I'm sorry, but even with the little information OP has provided, this is the most bizarre issue to focus on. It's not the divorce. It's not the remarriage. It's not even the pregnancy. It's the name.  And don't mistake not getting trapped in grief for not experiencing it.  Grief shouldn't be a weapon, darling.", ">Because it\u2019s absolutely in poor as shit taste to name a new baby after a dead one. It\u2019s shitting on the memory of the dead child and it\u2019s a slap in the fact to both Op and ops mom. \n\nWhy?\n\nObviously that's your opinion, but the abundance of people called \"something jr\" suggests it's not a big deal to most people.\n\nThe baby obviously doesn't care.", "Again, you\u2019re making things up. Saying something is a *painful memory* does not mean someone is trapped in the grief. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing in this post that indicates *anything* about the mom not wanting the baby to be named that or that she\u2019s upset about it. It\u2019s *OP* that\u2019s upset about it. Which is why I\u2019m saying it\u2019s ridiculous for you to say she\u2019s unstable. \n\nI\u2019m not talking about OP or her feelings on the baby. I\u2019m talking specifically about how much or a reach it is for you to make up the story and decide to judge the mother based on that."]}
