If they never end up married then the ring must be returned to whoever purchased it. I can't have people thinking that traditional means legal which I feel like a lot of people might based off your comment. If they are in the US and he had purchased the ring, then broke off the engagement and OP decided to keep it - then he could have taken her to court and 100% would have gotten the ring back or the value of the ring if she sold it. \n\nBut since OP purchased their own ring they really have no leg to stand on, so you are right it is theirs to do with as they like. 100% NTA", "You don't need to collect evidence in the future.

At the end of the day, it\u2019s your life, and you deserve to be happy and safe", "You sound like a smart person who understands how to survive.  Block his flying monkeys and move on.\n\nIf he is still screaming about a ring, send him a ring gag with instructions to put his lying mouth to work at the nearest truck stop.  Then maybe next time he proposes to someone foolish enough to trust him, he'll have the cash to buy a ring himself.", "well for your next relationships, know this is a major red flag, someone pestering you into marrying faster than you feel ready for. mid twenties is quite reasonable. you should also always speak your mind about not being ready and never let anyone bully you into marrying, or anyone else.", "No, because morality laws aren't a thing in the US. The ring is contingent on marriage, not fidelity."]}
