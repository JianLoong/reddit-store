So my parents and I are sleeping in the living room which is only divided by my brother's bed through a curtain. The bathroom is outside the living room. \n\nThis night, around 30 minutes after everyone said goodnight to each other I had to go to the bathroom, and when I was coming back, it was pitch dark so I turned on my phone flash it took me around 5 minutes or less but I had to hang a towel onto the chair (it's pretty humidity here so we have to hang any used towels) and I had to get my noise cancelling headphones because my dad was snoring really loudly. My brother was about to sleep but woke up because I think I angled my phone wrong for a little bit on accident and he woke up, he yelled at me to \"go to sleep quickly!\" and I yelled back in the same tone \"I will!\" And then I got my headphones (it had a zipper so it did make a sound but I tried to match it to the rhythm of my dad's snoring which was louder) and when I was charging my phone and we said the same things again. Then he turned on the lights of his room for an hour while opening the curtains because he was mad at me. It woke my parents up but I went to sleep covering my eyes.\n\nLater, I had not known that my flash woke him up, I thought he was already awake and was yelling at me to go to sleep, so I apologized. And also I think I should have prepared my headphones before I went to sleep as well so I also apologized for that as well. I was the asshole who started it, and I thought he was the asshole who finished it.\n\nHowever while my mom did say both was in the wrong because I accidently harmed the wellbeing of someone while my brother purposly had bad thoughts to ruin the night as well. However, my brother never apologized and when I said something about it she said because my bro woke up from my 5 minute phone flashlight and I was able to sleep through an hour of light being turned on so it's no harm no foul for me so why does he need to apologize. \n\nMy dad said I started it so it was all my bad, because he would have never turned the lights on if it wasn't for my flash. So I asked what if someone looked at someone weird (like glaring) and the other person cussed them out a lot, would both be in the wrong or would only the person who looked at someone funny be in the wrong? And he said only the guy looking. \n\nI'm so confused, I get that revenge might be satisfying and justified sometimes but isn't doing a bad thing in retaliation also bad? Especially if it's more extreme than before. I get I was the asshole who started it but wasn't turning on the lights for a hour his choice still? I get it, it might've been deserved but isn't it still bad to do what he did and make it hard for us to sleep? By the way, I know I was the bad person for it but I thought this situation was a everyone sucks here situation. Can you guys please tell me if everyone sucks or it's just me?", "created_utc": 1703568471, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r0sfc/aita_for_turning_on_the_phone_flash_for_5_minutes/", "score": 7, "replies": ["#This is now a Proctologists Only Orifice\r\n\r\nWhen a post is in [POO\u2122 mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023) only users with enough subreddit comment karma are able to comment.

You were staying in an unfamiliar location and needed to navigate to and from the bathroom without bumping into the people and things on the way there and back. It's completely normal to use a phone light to make your way somewhere in the dark. NTA", "NTA and it sounds like you might be the family's punching bag with how \"people pleasing\" your language and behavior is. Your brother took an extremely minor issue and turned it into a giant one. You were just briefly ignorant while he is the one that chose to harbor anger and be a huge asshole about it. Even if he shouldn't apologize to you (he should tho) I don't understand why your parents don't want one from him if he also woke them with his bullshit. He needs to figure out why he can't let little things go, especially when it is a very minor accident that the offending party is apologizing for. What does he even get out of acting that way besides just making himself more mad for even longer?\n\nYour parents enabling that behavior is going to do him zero favors when he's out in the real world on his own. The rest of the world won't coddle him or give him a free pass when he acts like an asshole. He's in for a rude awakening if this kind of overreaction is normal for him."]}
