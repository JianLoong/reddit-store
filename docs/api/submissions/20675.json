I live with my mom, her husband Steve, and their daughter Molly (5). My dad lives halfway across the country, and is in no financial position to look after a kid which is why my mom has full custody. In spite of that, my dad and I are really close. We have daily video calls and send each other cards and presents on holidays and birthdays, and if it was feasible, I would totally rather live with him. That is all to say, I don\u2019t need another \u201cfather figure\u201d to take his place. \n\nAnyway, the other day, Molly referred to Steve as \u201cme and (my name)\u2019s daddy\u201d and I corrected her that he\u2019s her daddy, not mine. Molly looked dismayed and asked me what I meant and said \u201cdoes that mean you\u2019re not my brother?!\u201d. I explained to her that I have a different dad and that her dad is my mom\u2019s husband, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s my dad. I reassured her that I\u2019m still her brother and I love her and yadda yadda. Steve shot me a death glare and my mom just looked sad. Molly seemed to accept my answer and we carried on with what we were doing. \n\nLater, my mom took me aside and told me she was sad that I hadn\u2019t accepted Steve yet, and called me petty and cruel for \u201cpushing your issues on a little kid\u201d. She said that, like it or not, Steve is her husband so that makes him my \u201cfather figure\u201d and that I \u201cneed to find room in your heart for both of your dads\u201d. I told her that Steve is not, and never will be, my dad, and told her that \u201cjust because you hate my real dad doesn\u2019t mean I have to throw him away like you did\u201d. I was worried I would lose my temper even more than I already had, and left the situation to cool off. \n\nIn the time since, Molly has been asking me incessant questions about my dad and why my mom left him (she slept with her gym buddy but I\u2019m not going to tell Molly that until she\u2019s older, for now the story is that my mom just fell out of love with my dad). Steve has been avoiding me like the plague and being passive aggressive when we have to interact, and my mom has been been bugging me to apologize to him. She\u2019s also been trying to find excuses for me to skip my video calls with my dad, but I\u2019m not going to ever do that.

Kids are smarter than adults give them credit for. She wasn\u2019t too young to learn that you have different dads, and will grow into a person who appreciates that you\u2019re willing to be honest with her. \n\nI grew up a child of divorced parents, and was always quick to correct ANYONE who called my stepfather my dad. It\u2019s just what you do, because you know what your relationship is to people. \n\nYour mom is being a massive AH here though. It\u2019s her job to stand by you on this, and yet she\u2019s choosing the route of pretending her past didn\u2019t happen? Yikes. Good luck to her relationship with Molly when she figures out in the near future whatever else your mom is lying to her about.", "NTA.\n\nYou explained it to Molly perfectly well. You were factual while being kind, which is not always an easy balance to achieve.\n\nYour mom is wrong to call you \"petty and cruel to push your issues on a little kid\". You did no such thing. Molly is not too young to learn that Steve is not your father.\n\nWith your mom, you were also factual. Less kind, although I'm not sure she deserved kindness in the moment. And you were very wise to leave the room when you felt you were close to losing your temper and saying something you would regret later.\n\nYour mom is wrong about the \"father figure\" and \"room in your heart\" stuff. You *have* a dad, and your relationship with him is very good. You're not looking for another dad, especially at the age of 17, which is not far off being an adult.\n\nIf you and Steve could develop a friendly and close relationship as adults, great! If not, that's perfectly OK. Your mother chose him; you didn't. All you owe each other is politeness. (And frankly, the passive-aggressive stuff concerns me. Steve is not behaving like the adult here.)\n\nYou have nothing to apologize to Steve for - let's be clear about that.\n\nYou edged close to AH-ness with your remark to your mother that it \"doesn't mean I have to throw him away like you did\", but I don't think you stepped over the line. I probably would have said something similar.\n\n*She's also been trying to find excuses for me to skip my video calls with my dad.*\n\nPush back against that, hard. You're not a little kid, she has no right (and probably no ability) to do that, and these calls are important to you in maintaining your good relationship with your dad.\n\nShe cannot deprive you of those calls as some kind of warped punishment (for something you haven't done, even!)  If she arranges something for you which clashes with a call, such as a family outing or whatever, push back and tell her that the call takes priority for you.", "NTA - It sounds like you're the only one answering questions like a mature adult.  At 5yrs old a child is perfectly capable of understanding that you have a different dad, but you're still her brother.  And great job on reassuring her and not doing any half-sib bs!!!\n\nYou have every right to your feelings, your connection to your father, and to not lie to your little sister.  You've even gone out of your way to...soften the truth for her.  Honestly, these are all questions your mother should have already talked to her about by now.\n\nAnd how immature is her husband to be glaring at you or avoiding you?", "She's five. To me, it's weird that she doesn't already know your Dad is someone else.", "NTA and for once on this sub, we have an evil stepdad story lol. In all seriousness, you have no obligation to accept anyone as your dad if you don\u2019t want to. All you did was tell your sister the truth, a truth she was going to find out anyway, and I think you did it in a very respectful and gentle way. Your mom trying to force you to connect with her husband and trying to drive a wedge between you and your real dad is concerning, and her and her husband\u2019s issue might be that your relationship with your dad is interfering in their perfect picket fence life and reminding them of your mom\u2019s past cheating. Good luck, you\u2019re going to need it.", "nta. set boundaries. Sat her down and explain how you feel and that there is nothing to argue about. Your feeling are facts she has to accept them.", "NTA at all buddy! Your mom cheated on your dad, broke up their marriage, and expects you to treat her husband the same as your dad? She\u2019s the asshole here. Steve is an innocent victim unless he is the aforementioned gym \u201cbuddy\u201d she cheated with. I get him wanting to be close to his step kid too. As long as he isn\u2019t pushing a father/son relationship too hard and is an otherwise decent person, I\u2019d cut him some slack. He might just be hurt and think you hate him. Maybe try for an uncle/nephew style relationship with him if it comfortable for you. But your mom? Yikes. She\u2019s trying to force it way too hard and that will never work. Just don\u2019t let any (well deserved IMO) bitterness towards your mom spill over to Steve unless he really deserves it though. I have a few friends who are step parents and it\u2019s rough.", "NTA. You are more mature than your mom and stepdad. Sometimes just explaining things is easier than covering it up with a lie. You are also allowed to have boundaries. Sounds like you have issues already with your mom and the way she left your dad. I think the way you explained it was great. He's not your biodad but you and Molly are still siblings. Pretty simple to me. Good luck to you!", "NTA.", "NTA. Honestly, it\u2019s astonishing she made it 5 years without knowing this. Who did she think you were having daily video calls with? It\u2019s not appropriate for you mother to expect you to hide your parentage from your half sister just to save her from a conversation she\u2019ll have to have eventually anyway.", "NTA. You set your boundaries. They didn\u2019t like it. \n\nYou have a year-ish left until 18. \n\nHave plans to move with your dad when you hit 18. Stevie is going to want you out & Mommy Dearest aint going to do the right thing.", "This is so weird to me that the mom would see it that way. My partner has a son from before we met. I've know him since he was 3 and he's 8 now. He's doesn't remember a time before I was in his life, but I absolutely am in no way a mother figure to him. We don't refer to me as step mom and I don't want to be referred to as step mom. He has a mom. I back up my partner when he needs it and we do fun things together but I'm not his mom and that's very much okay.", "Nta, but a good lesson here is time and place. There was no harm in letting the comment go and addressing it later after a thought process could be completed to cause the least harm to your sibling", "NTA \nIt was easier I guess with my half sisters since I visited my mom once a year so they grew up knowing. I actually find it strange that she did not know already. I have a 5 year old and she understands the concept that my half sisters and I don't have the same mom just fine. It is not a big deal unless someone makes it a big deal.\n\n Let me point out that you were not correcting your sister you were just educating her about the family dynamics that will always be there. You also explained that very well. It is not like you talked shit about him when you told her and you reassured her. She of course is going to question you incessantly about your Dad and why are your dads different and all that. You explained why they are not married in a very developmentally appropriate way. Now you can tell her that you don't want to talk about it or redirect her to another topic since the questioning is getting a bit much. \n\nMom and Step Dad are the problem. Is it just me or is it messed up that Mom wants you to lie to your sister. Mom is also the one that put Step Dad into this position of power in your life that she as the custodial parent is supposed to take. Any kid, especially ones that are coming out of divorce that was this dramatic, would be very resentful towards mom and towards stepdad Also any adult who has the common sense of a snail would know that you're going to have a negative response to almost everything going on. I mean come on.", "NTA.\n\nI think your parents (not your dad, but still your step-father) are upset because they never thought they'd have to explain this to their daughter, and you stepped up where they failed.", "NTA.  But if you feel comfortable, you might consider a talk with mom and Steve.\n\nSteve can have a part to play but he\u2019s not dad and they should respect that.\n\nUnless Steve is an asshole, cut him a little slack. He probably just wants to appreciate you as his wife\u2019s son, but mom sounds like the instigator here and has to get herself sorted out. Ask her to, if it\u2019s safe to do so (no backlash).\n\nDivorced parents can be super difficult about their ex and it sucks for you to be in the middle of it.", "Meh. NTA. I don\u2019t think you should\u2019ve maybe told Molly that, but she\u2019s around that age where she can start understanding stuff like that. It\u2019s not your responsibility to accept that guy as your dad, especially if it\u2019s because of a personal issue.", "OP you\u2019re not really the AH here, but you could\u2019ve handled the situation much better.\n\nBuilding a relationship with your stepdad can be a wonderful thing, but you don\u2019t have to, that\u2019s perfectly fine. You\u2019re not entitled to accept him, plus the nasty looks from him are 100% unnecessary. I think it\u2019s unnecessary that you told Molly that bluntly, but it\u2019s ok to tell her the truth. I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re stepdad was so angry, all you did was point it out.\n\nNTA", "OK.\n\nYou are by no means an AH for not thinking of Steve as a father figure. You've lived with Steve for the last 6+ years, he's married to your mom, and he is a figure of authority in your home, but you don't have to think of him as a father figure. You can like the guy fine, but not think of him as a father figure - that's OK.\n\nBut was it actually necessary to correct your 5 year old sister like that? It wouldn't have actually hurt you to let her statement go, would it?\n\nNTA", "I'm going with ESH- You're whole \"my deadbeat cheating bad is better than my mum\" thing is pretty AH behavior. That said Your mum was condescending and clearly not listening to you. Both of you are the AH.\n\nEdit: sorry misread who did the cheating. Yeah NTA! x", ">That is all to say, I don\u2019t need another \u201cfather figure\u201d to take his place. \n\nFun fact: You can have more than one father figure. Having a second doesn't mean the second is taking your dad's place. \n\nShe's 5. She didn't need to be corrected on that. It was immaterial. You should've just let it go. Your mom's a jerk for her handling of it, but she's not wrong about you pushing your issues on a kid. \n\nYou can see why your behavior is a problem because it led to her asking all these questions you can't effectively answer. \n\nESH. You opened that can of worms and now the one who is going to suffer is an innocent 5 year old. Your mom is an asshole for pushing you too hard to accept Steve as your dad. \n\nShe's probably also being counter productive by trying to force him to be your *dad*, that's just going to get further push back from you. You're not looking for another dad, and it reinforces the mentality you now have of that it's some replacement. You can accept Steve as a person and an important person in your mom's life without him being a new dad. \n\nDo you have anything against Steve aside from that your mom wants him to replace your dad? Because you didn't mention it, and it seems like it kinda sucks for him. If he's putting in a genuine effort to have a relationship with you, don't undercut that just because of your mom's mistakes.", "She\u2019s 5, you needed to explain that a lot better or probably brought it to your mom and stepdad so they could have that conversation with her. NAH but you\u2019re damn close.", "YTA sorry and I know it's not a popular opinion but... It's easy for your dad to be a \"good father figure\" when all he has to do is call, not do any of the actual work of raising/taking care of a kid. You want to live with him and you're 17. If he wanted you to live with him, you would be.", "Leaning towards YTA. I just don\u2019t think you need to tell Molly this at 5 years old. She\u2019s too young and kids at that age worry a lot and overthink. I\u2019d have let her lead her happy life in ignorance until she was a bit older. But only you know your family dynamic so I\u2019ll trust your judgement on this. I would have personally just been more delicate.", "YTA having another father figure doesn\u2019t take the place of your father, he\u2019s just a spare. \n\nFurther, saying she \u201cthrew\u201d your bio dad away makes you an AH - whatever happened in their relationship isn\u2019t your business and isn\u2019t for you to judge. Definitely not your business to tell Molly in the future about what happened either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why should he have to hide his past to protect his mom and step-dad?", "Um my mom was the one who cheated, and I never once mentioned child support or alimony, unpaid or otherwise. You\u2019re wrong in all accounts and I\u2019m wondering if you even read the post.", "Pretty sure the mom is the one that was cheating", "I think you need to read it again", "As I\u2019ve said in other comments, I don\u2019t like Steve because he doesn\u2019t respect me at all. He\u2019s tried to do the good-cop/bad-cop routine with him as the bad cop and my mom as the good cop, but it just made him look like an overly strict disciplinarian, which he still is.", "How would you have explained it to her? I\u2019m genuinely curious, I can\u2019t think of a gentler way while still getting my point across.", "I disagree.  She asked and he told her the truth respectfully for all parties.  And there is no shame having different fathers here.  You are proposing that he lies to molly and that just leads to more lies and broken trust.  NTA.  OP, I\u2019m sorry your mom is being weak here and letting these conversations fall on you.", "I mean mom fucked her gym buddy so I guess threw away was a nicer way of saying it his mom instead of calling her names and in OPs comments states stepdad doesn\u2019t show him any respect just cuz you fuck someone\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t make you a father figure to them.", "Oh don\u2019t worry, I already have plans to go to university in my dad\u2019s city", "Yeah. I suspect it happens a lot. Which is sad.", "7:30 at your age?! LMAO WOW! I can see why there\u2019s a bit of friction if he\u2019s up your ass like that.", "Yeah you absolutely don\u2019t have to accept him. Your mom and him pushing you to apologize is not cool at all. It\u2019s also him being an ass if he keeps trying to micromanage you, especially as it\u2019s not your real dad.", "Yeah I saw. Have updated the post with NTA x", "Aahuhh sorry didn't see that, misread on my part thanks for correcting me x", "You need to read my updated comment again, and the comments underneath lol", "Mk. I stand by my judgment of it not being the thing you need to bring up to molly. That's not an issue she needs to be involved in, but that does just mean your mom sucks even more. If Steve's a jerk, you don't owe him shit.", "\u2018She asked\u2019- she\u2019s also only 5 years old. You don\u2019t need to answer everything a 5 year old asks. I just hope Molly doesn\u2019t grow up with an emotional distance between her and her brother now. Even if slight.", "And you're prepared to pay for uni and support yourself fully?", "Oh neat thanks, I saw the original and you must have updated before I commented lol", "Ah my b must\u2019ve not refreshed till after I commented", "I get what you mean, I guess in the moment it seemed like a bigger deal than it actually was. Thanks for the perspective."]}
