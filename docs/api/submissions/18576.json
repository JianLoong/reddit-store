You owe them your empathy.  It's a terrible spot for anyone to be in.

If Clara can't come up with $2000 in an emergency like this, it is unlikely that she can afford to raise the child. This is of course assuming that Becky and John are now in a position to be good parents. Were  they just too young back then when she was born?", "NAH\n\nI've read through a lot of your comments, and I think there's something everyone is missing. John is not behaving as a parent, but a fun uncle. Abby wanting to be around him is normal when someone is fun, and it's very easy to be fun when you're not there all the time. I never asked to go home from my relatives or friends houses - home meant routine, like bedtime, cleaning my room, doing homework, eating vegetables; but my relatives and friends parents never did any of that stuff. The real parenting stuff. But that's the important stuff. My parents weren't always the people I was dying to spend time with, but they were the most valuable part of my life. They are where I still, as an adult, feel safe.\n\nYou say that Clara is at a computer - is she working? If that's the case and she works at a computer while Abby is on her iPad, that's very different to being neglectful. Having an autistic child who is largely non-verbal means a very different style of parenting at different times of the day, and there isn't nearly enough info here to criticise Clara as much as everyone is. You don't say how she manages Abby's eating habits, hygiene, bedtime, etc. To be honest OP, you can't know the full details of how Clara parents at all hours of the day. Making a judgment that John would be better based on a limited set of information is actually a bit dangerous.\n\nAnd there's no telling what kind of disruption Abby would experience, being moved from the only home and parent she's ever known, to someone who has never fully parented her. You say she can't understand some of these concepts - please focus on that. She won't understand why her mother isn't there anymore. That's just cruel and not in her best interests. Becky may have been overwhelmed and John may have been manipulated, but Clara was the person to step up and take Abby in. She is clearly distressed at the thought of losing her. And that does mean something.\n\nJohn and Becky did abandon their daughter. John is far less responsible for that, but he had options to fight for custody even back then. They would have sucked and been hard, but he had the option. And it's a bit selfish to let Clara do the really hard work of infancy, toddler, getting her diagnosed with autism, and then jump back in when Abby's a bit older and already has some systems in place. I've actually seen people do this and want their children back when they're in a certain sweet spot of no longer being a toddler but not quite a teenager. It went disastrously wrong as the children got older.\n\nI'm not trying to defend anyone in this scenario, but this isn't as clear-cut as your comments and the responses have suggested. It would not be good for Abby for adults to make uninformed choices based on what they want. Was Clara wrong to not square the legalities away before? Absolutely. She's left herself and her daughter vulnerable to this situation. But she's not a monster. John isn't a magical solution.\n\nYou're not wrong to not want to pay for your sister's mistake, but she's not wrong for wanting to protect her daughter, and the bio-parents aren't wrong for wanting visitation (but are wrong imo to want custody). All of this is so far beyond Reddit's paygrade. And to be honest, putting your opinion into an already messy situation is only going to make everything more volatile.", "NTA\n\nEven if you gave the $2000, John could challenge the adoption and you could be out $2000 without it making any difference at all.  Stay out of this mess.", "Decline involvement.  You will be hated whatever you do or don't do.", "NTA", "NTA she is the AH.  She did not make the adoption a priority when you could help.  You now have your own family and cannot help.  Her problem not yours.", "That raises another point. Abby is Autistic and partially nonverbal. She loves her real dad, like A LOT. But she also loves her mom (adopted). She has been asked but she doesn't understand.", "She never had him sign the birth certificate. She truly manipulated him to the fullest back then. He wanted his daughter even back then but she told him no.", "Yeah, what a mess.", "That's up for debate. Abby is partially nonverbal Autistic and loves John, like a lot. Begs to go to his house most days (she uses her iPad to communicate). I mean, she obviously loves my sister, her mom (adoptive) but I've never seen her beg to go back home. If that makes sense. She's super attached to John so clearly there's a father/daughter bond there that truly cannot be broken. She has no idea it's her real dad (I don't think?) But she still has the instinct of him being a safe place for her. \n\nAt my sister's (her adopted mom) she doesn't do anything but sit around all day. Zero stimulation. They hardly interact with her on a good day. But over to Johns she is able to go out and do fun things. He even brought her to Disney in February.", "So, Abby is partially nonverbal Autistic. From what I've seen (and I'm around a lot) Abby will do everything in her power to communicate her desire to go see John. She uses her tablet to communicate it, she points to his pictures and says \"go\". Every single time I am there there is some way that she is asking for John. And up until now, Clara has been letting her go with John every single day practically, which further builds their bond. He's brought her to Disney World, the Disney cruise, Disney on ice (she loves Disney), brings her to the movies every weekend, brings her out for ice cream, goes to all her sports games (even when Clara don't go), etc. He is an active parent. Clara on the other hand doesn't do much of anything with her. I mean, when Abby is home she just sits around all day and watches TV while her mom (adoptive) just sits at a computer. I personally believe John is a better option, despite it being really fucked up. Her therapist has also made a point to say that she feels John is a huge positive in Abby's life.", "This. Even if Clara tried to file the adoption now, John could easily block it.", "Not true. He never gave up his parental rights, as he was never put on the birth certificate. He was alienated from the process completely because my sister said she didn't know who the dad was.", "So.. Clara gets a bit over $900 a month in disability for Abby, free health insurance (through the state) and also gets a pretty hefty amount in food stamps because of Abby's strict dietary needs. So she's getting quite a bit to have Abby live with her. I wouldn't say she isn't attached to Abby but I mean.. she doesn't hang out with her at all so I'm not sure. To put it this way, for the past 3 years Abby has been joining me and my kids for Halloween because Clara can't be bothered to bring her kid out.", "I do, actually. And Abby would be in better hands with John. Not only that, but as a father myself, I would NEVER have put myself in to this position to begin with. My sister failing to do what's right is now coming back to bite her. I offered help several times in earlier years and she declined all my help. Now that I have my own family to support she expects me to fully jump on board and I won't.", "I personally feel she would be better off with John and Becky. Clara doesn't do much of anything with Abby. Abby spends most of her day sitting on her tablet or watching TV when she is home. But when she is with Becky and John, she goes out and is able to socialize and do kid stuff. I mean.. Clara doesn't even go to her sports games half the time but John always shows up.", "It's not my job to understand custody laws. I'm not the one in this position. All I know is that legally he has grounds to fight for custody because she never filed the paperwork, even AFTER I offered to cover the entire cost years ago.", "did you read? OP isn't getting in the way of the bio dad at all.", "Just because things are comfortable doesn't make 2k pocket change that won't be missed and can be dropped without a thought or care. Especially if you have kids. I would describe us as comfortable but it would be a big deal if there was an unplanned 2k expense.", "I'm definitely not comfortable. Our savings only has $6k in it and that's what we have saved for the kids college. My wife was in a car wreck last year and needed intensive surgery and that depleted a lot of our savings but she's alive and with us and that's what matters. I know it sounds heartless of me, but even if John gets custody of Abby, she would still be very much apart of the family. They only live 4 houses down and he's married to my sister now (Abby's bio mom).", "Prior to Becky marrying John, she had Abby a lot. Abby knows that Becky is her \"real\" mom. It was a weird dynamic. Not really sure where Becky stands on all of it (haven't talked to her).", "She does know that Becky is her real mother, yes. She has a very strong bond with Becky as well and Becky has had her a lot over the years. She simply never called her mom.", "what does her therapist say?", "If she completes the adoption the judge might overturn it if he can prove he was misled and never consented to it.", "If he didn\u2019t sign the birth certificate/adoption papers and she didn\u2019t file your sister is screwed.\n\nThe fact is if she files now he still contest it. It still going to look bad on your sisters part. A judge is going to rip her to shreds for being so careless. Then he is going to wonder if she has the means to take care of a child if she could not afford $2000 in 10 years. \n\nThe bio dad can force a paternity test. Say he never signed his rights away. He already has a relationship with the child. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t think$2000 is going to save your sister. Trust me if he has made his intentions known he has already started the paper work to file for custody of this child. \n\nBest case scenario is if your sister makes a deal to coparent with them and keeping this out of the courts. Because if she doesn\u2019t I don\u2019t see her seeing this child much after dad wins custody.", "Wow. Well, there's nothing like a DNA test to settle the matter.", "But didn\u2019t he marry her?", "So this is not on Clara this is all Becky. Is he still married to this wonderful piece of woman (sarcasm)? So Becky will be back to be the greatest mom ever? Wonderful.", "Sounds like your sister, Abby's adopted mom, is neglecting Abby and she would be better off in her father's custody from the picture that you've given. Your sister, \"Clara\", should be ashamed of herself. She doesn't have Abby's best interests at heart.", "Sounds like John is the better parent for his daughter.\n\nIf his wife doesn't want her child back John will have a choice between his child or his wife... I'm going to guess that if he has the chance to have his daughter he probably won't hesitate to remove the wife from his life.\n\nNTA for not paying, especially now we know John always wanted his child and is being a great parent to her! John deserves his daughter and she deserves him.", "Yeah your sister is screwed. She might as well prepare herself to loose custody.\n\nBut honestly makes me wonder if John was playing the long game here. Your sister forced him into giving her up. So what better way to undo the adoption but marry bio mom play uncle of the year. Take her to do amazing things. I am sure there are some really cute photos and videos. Build an amazing bond that will traumatize the little girl if contact isn\u2019t kept. And  your sister helped him out with the biggest win by not finalizing the adoption.\n\nHe was probably only hoping for a case of neglect or a simple relationship but hit the lottery when he found out the adoption isn\u2019t even legal.", "Thank you for clarifying. For the record, you're definitely NTA for not fronting the fee. No one else is entitled to your money, and it's 100% on Clara that she didn't do it herself, especially since she had plenty of time to get it done before now. I just found myself more concerned with what's best for Abby. I hope it all works out for her. \ud83e\udd1e", "What about your her bio mom? She didn\u2019t want Abby then and manipulated it so that Abby\u2019s father couldn\u2019t take her. What does she think about abbeys father wanting custody now?", "Whether or not he is on the birth certificate would not matter.\n  He can prove he is the father via a DNA test. It actually helps his case, he is being blocked from his child against his will.", "Wow, explains a lot.\n\nI hope her Dad gets custody of her.\n\nIt really looks like Abby is part of her income.", "Sorry but isn\u2019t John married to the woman that lied to him and gives away his daughter? Also better with John. This is what you think what Abby thinks cause after 8 years unless your sister is the shittiest mother\u2026", "I don't blame you, this is not your fight.  You can still be a part of Abby's life regardless of who gains custody (providing they allow it...)", "She would be better off with John Who is now married to Becky, the bio mother, Who lied to him and gave up their kid 8 years ago ?\n\nPoor kid. All of th\u00e9 adults in her life couldn't care less about her.", "I'm sorry, but this reeks of pettiness. You're butthurt that your sister didn't listen to you, and now you're lording it over her. But hey, John took her to Disney so of course he must be the better parent.\n\nESH", "I don't see how you're doing anything wrong here, OP.", "He has the right to absolutely raise the child, he never terminated his parental rights.", "Maybe ask her. Because just from my outsider perspective, doing everything except the last itty bit of paperwork to finalize the adoption of your niece could be from the Claras thought that maybe Becky does want to be the mother and I want to keep this chance open for her without the whole process that would otherwise follow. But this never happend so she forgot that this still open until now. However, after 8 years of course Clara is very much emotionally attached and sees Abby as her child.", "He says that Abby has a very clear bond with John and thinks it would be best if she continues to see and hang out with him. He doesn't come out and say he should get custody but he has made it clear that John should remain a big part of her life.", "That's what I was wondering about. Before anyone spends $2000 they need start by having a chat with a family lawyer or legal aid. Filing after the father has expressed reservations (even if he isn't on the birth certificate it seems like he's generally acknowledged to be the father) doesn't sound wise.", "I wonder if the paper work would still be valid. I wonder if a home study and all the legal hoops would not have to be jumped through again. This isn\u2019t just a year or two after it was down it\u2019s been 10 years. There is a real possibility the sister may not even qualify to be an adoptive parent now.", "Yes.. it raises a bigger shit show, yes? So Becky did 100% give up Abby, wanted nothing to do with her, etc etc and gave John absolutely no say whatsoever in any of it. Shit bag. 100%. Even I can sit here as her brother and say this. But I will say that Becky has been taking Abby a lot since she was about 2(ish- I believe). Even before she got back with John she started having Abby over a lot. She started becoming extremely over protective and turned her life around. But she never stepped on Clara's toes because this was no longer her kid, if that makes sense. So Becky, I think, regrets it as well but feels she has no rights here (understandably).", "Execpt John is married to bio mother now, and she doesn't want the kid back...", "I actually haven't spoken directly to Becky about this. I've been trying to steer clear as much as possible because it's an absolute shit show in my eyes and my involvement would probably make it worse. \n\nBUT from what I have personally witnessed, Becky is showing a lot of strong emotions that suggests that she too regrets giving Abby away. Since Abby was roughly 2ish Becky has been taking her really frequently. There's been weeks of time periods where Abby has been with Becky and not Clara (adoptive mom). I've personally witnessed Becky bawling her eyes out over Abby, though she never said why. So I do feel like Becky has regretted it for awhile but didn't want to step on Clara's toes.", "8 years is a good amount of time for op sister, bio mom, to grow and be in a situation to raise a child.", "I explained why I can't help her now and it has nothing to do with pettiness. It has to do with the fact that I have my own children to worry about now. $2k is a lot of money to throw down the drain when you have your own children to support.", "I think OP is being lied to.  $2000 will not stop dad's claim.", "You know visitation rights? She can stay with Clara where she grow up and spend also quality time with John. Like it happen on divorce couple.", "John needs to get this in writing from the therapist. But the therapist likely won\u2019t make up a rapport if he asks, not until he has gained official rights through a court. So if you want to help him, see if you can look into the annual rapports of this therapist. I wonder who has legal custody now, since clara has not make the adoption official. Had Becky rights to these medical reports? She should ask for them and ask the therapist to mention Abby\u2019s bond with John", "Even if he's not on now, he can go to court and have a paternity test ordered. I wouldn't be filing anything or paying for any fees for the adoption until this is straightened out. Running to the courts before would just waste the money if the judge decides to to overturn it because the way it was handled not getting the father acknowledged and him consenting to it.", "Sorry I feel ESH here except the kid. Your sister was the only one that toke this baby in years ago. Bio mom didn\u2019t want her, bio dad was lied but not even he checked once on his old girlfriend, you also didn\u2019t toke her. She didn\u2019t file the proper paperwork. She failed herself.\nPeople change their minds, but again we are not talking about a pair of shoes. I think sister and bio dad should sit and talk and find the best compromise for the sake of everybody involved, specially the kids. This sounds like a lengthy and costly and horrible legal battle nobody wants. And you should stay clear of it.", "Stay out of it - this is the drama that will break up your sister's relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't let it affect your family, to - do not get drawn into it.", "I have 8 year old kid, she is mine but if tomorrow someone come from the hospital said there was a mistake and I have to return the child. Yeah no. Sorry. 8 years it\u2019s a bond formed both ways. They are not toys you can exchange and return and switch and swap. Not only the child but this woman that for 8 years raised her. Yes she didn\u2019t do good with the paperwork but OP hasn\u2019t said anything else about her. So I am inclined to believe she is a caring and devote parent.", "Who cares about said child who has been raised by someone else for the last 8 years, right?", "You wouldn't be throwing it down the drain though. You of course have no obligation to do so but....she deserves to be where she is wanted. Her bio mom is probably only showing regret because the father wants her back.", "Probably more wishful thinking than actual lies.", "Especially as John is now mzrried to Becky aka bio mother Who didn't want the kid 8 years ago and Who still doesn't seem to want to be involved now.", "But if he actually engages with the child instead off sitting her in front of a tv then why should dad have only visitation. Let dad have custody and she can visit the sister.", "Im just saying that sister could be different now. Who knows what best for that child. I didn\u2019t see any examples of any of them as parents.  I wish the child best of luck after the end results happened.", "She fostered a kid instead of adopting her - so she will have to give the girl back to her parents, where she belongs.", "I saw no examples of any of then as parents. Who knows whats best for that child. All im saying is that sister could  be different now after eight years. Its a possibility she grew. Now she may be ready to raise a child but that doesn\u2019t mean her bio child from eight years ago.", "Could be.", "Because the child has been living for 8 years with a mother. And it\u2019s better not to change drastically her life? One thing is inserting in her life a new person slowly another is here from now on your mother is not your mom, and this is your new family, your new house and room and school. And mommy you get to see her sometime. \nIt\u2019s not that 50% of DNA makes up for 8 years of growing a person.", "The fact the OP not once mentioned the sister that gives away the daughter in the parents speech volumes. It\u2019s all about the father, and has a father himself I bet some money also in good old father/men my genes my property.", "There is a reason cause fostering for not last years. Let\u2019s alone 8. Already after 30 days family curt make a long time plan to carente not only the heath of the child but the expectation of the fostering parents. You know you tent to get attached to kids", "Not with a mother - with someone fostering her while NOT adopting her.", "I get that but even op and a therapist thinks that he is better for the little girl. \n\nSo if a stranger only knowing her a little while has build a bond so strong a therapist says it would be detrimental to her for him not be a huge part of her life then I wonder how strong the bond is with the adoptive mom.\n\nI honestly think the best thing for this little girl would be to do what the therapist recommend and not go through the courts other then maybe the dad getting some rights.\n\nBut if the therapist says she is better off with dad that\u2019s where she needs to be. If the therapist suggests what you said then they should do that. \n\nBut dad should not just give up if he is what\u2019s best for his daughter.", "I didn't mention it because it wasn't apart of my question. It's information that could have been asked for, since it held no relevance (in my opinion).", "No OP stated therapist said it\u2019s unclear due to child disability and she is right now in a good situation (bio dad visiting, stay with adoptive mother). Then he thinks (and it\u2019s clear he is not on his sister side) it will be better she goes with bio dad. He put his own words on therapist mouth.", "Well if bio dad get custody then backy get to be back to be the mother\u2026 you think this have no whatsoever any impact you live under a rock.", "That may be true.\n\nBut I 100 percent agree the adults need to work this out without going to court. A custody battle no one would come out winning especially the child.", "I never said it wouldn't have an impact."]}
