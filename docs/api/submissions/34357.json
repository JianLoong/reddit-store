You can afford to lose her business.", "NTA. To reframe this, you as the store owner, kicked out and banned a minor patron who assaulted one of your employees and another patron who is responsible for said minor.

Banning someone rude from your store is actually a good business move, I think, because I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to experience that person in the store as a fellow customer.

If I\u2019d been in your store and saw this happen I probably would\u2019ve lost my shit! I had a friend in high school who had been in a car accident (her Mum died in said accident also) and people were brutal to her.
