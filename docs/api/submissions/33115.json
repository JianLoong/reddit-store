I'm currently studying (18F) and live alone with my abusive, mentally sick mom. I won't bore you with details, but she has done criminal life-threatening things to me that I can't even bother to report because the police are sh\\*t in my country and couldn't care less (I have tried, didn't work; made things worse). I dont have close family\r  \n\r  \nMy bf knows how much of a torture is letting me go home, so he lets me stay with him after my classes in college whenever I please. He lives a couple streets down my college, so I go there almost every break I have. Everything was fine for some months, I would sleep there 3 or 4 days a week. I have a scholarship/aid that gives me some monthly money to cover any books, supplies and other student stuff, so I got to buy breakfast and lunch without anyone's help, and I save the rest for things I need. \r  \n\r  \nFrom the very first moment, I'd only stay at my bf's room, which it's fine with me because his room is big and comfy, and I'm too shy anyways to come out. I swear, in all the months I've stayed in that apartment, not even once I sat on the dining table, neither on the sofa or watched tv in their living room. I limit myself to be in my bf's room, and at the most ONCE in a week I'd prepare something small for dinner in their kitchen.\r  \n\r  \nNot so long ago, my SIL had the audacity to tell me since i've been \"living\" with them, I'd had to start doing chores, help once a month to clean all the apartment, buy groceries and COOPERATE WITH A THIRD OF THE RENT. Her justifications were that I also consumed food, light, energy, gas and water, so it was fair for me to cooperate.\r  \n\r  \nThe thing is she also brings her bf in, and she doesnt ask him for these things because he \"let's her stay at his house too so it's balanced\". I accept the part of cleaning, but just my bf\u00b4s room and the kitchen, but in no way is justified for me to clean the other 100 square meter of that apartment, or to buy them food. I'll accept that last one if ate their meat or chicken every night, but I purposely choose to eat for dinner the less expensive stuff they have, like oats, boiled eggs or a sandwich, ONCE A WEEK.\r  \n\r  \nMy SIL told my bf she isnt going to let me in their house again if I dont follow their rules, and that she has been kindly enough since \"she is uncomfortable with my presence and needs privacy but still lets me be there all I want\". I repeat, I dont ever leave my bfs room, why does she act like I roam the apartment?\r  \n\r  \nI absolutely said no to those requirements, and my bf will still bring me in. I'm not spending the little money I have left to help to pay for a house I dont even live in, and now she doesnt aprove my relationship, and tells my boyfriend that he shouldnt be dating someone that lazy and ungrateful.

I totally get her not feeling comfortable with that when you\u2019re not contributing anything.

Either contribute like you've been asked, or live at your mother's apartment. You can't live somewhere and not contribute. It's not your apartment. Grow up. You're an adult now and adults pay their way.", "YTA\n\nYou live there in every way but a formal name\n\nIs a 1/3 of the rent MAYBE a bit steep?? Sure, maybe. Regardless, you have admitted to eating THEIR food (less inexpensive sure, still not yours) and sleeping there 3-4 days a week.\n\nMaybe just talk about living there full time for one and if that's not an option then guess what?? Time to cough up your fair share of the utilities and rent.", "YTA  So because you only eat the cheap food that means you are not eating food and because you only stay in one room it means you are not living there? that is not how it works in the real world.", "YTA because you are eating their food, using their utilities, and are living there at least 1/2 of the week.  Should you pay 1/3rd of the bills?  No.  But you do need to contribute.", "YTA. You do live there and you do eat some food.\n\nHowever, SIL wants to overcharge you. You need to negotiate.\n\nHer claim that her bf living there is \"balanced\" is BS. Her bf living in the apartment is to the detriment of your bf. Her bf still uses utilities and eats food. Both you and her bf should pay equal amounts. How much has he been paying? Does he also do cleaning?", "YTA sounds like you are living there and eating their food. Unfortunately it\u2019s not your house so you kind of have to follow the rules of the people who are letting you stay there ya know?", "YTA. Stop staying over. Don\u2019t eat ANY of their food. Don\u2019t shower or use the bathroom. Don\u2019t go over there. Then you won\u2019t need to pay for anything. You are what they call a moocher and everyone hates moochers", "YTA.", "YTA you are living there psycho", "YTA,  she's not your \"sister in law.\" You eat sleep shower and shit there multiple days a week,  every week.. you are living there.  Stop being a mooch and pay some of the bills to say thank you.", "Your home life sounds like it sucks but that doesnt change the situation that you're pretty much living there and eating their food.   \nIt doesnt matter that you eat the least expensive, you are there and eating their food. You are using their utilities, you are very frequently an additional presence in the apartment and its not wrong them saying you should pay rent if you're there as much as you are.   \nYou can say absolutely no to the requirements and with that be prepared to be told you're not welcome over anymore.   \nYTA", "Just by reading the title, YTA. Like, bestie you\u2019re taking advantage.", "YTA. \n\nYou live there the majority of the week. You eat food she pays for, use utilities she pays for etc. And your line about your boyfriend \"will bring you in\" is going to end in her getting a restraining order or having you trespassed from the apartment she pays at least half the rent for. She asked you to help out around the house and contribute or stay away and you are refusing as if you have the right to refuse. \n\nMaybe 1/3 of the rent is too much, the rest is reasonable if you want to continue to be there.", "You live there. Pay your due or get out.", "This is up to your bf and SIL to work out. If they cannot come to an agreement that you are ok with it may end the current arrangement between bf and SIL. Or you may need to move out. Like it or not SIL does get a say in how the house is run.\n\nESH because you shouldn't be paying equal amounts but something - definitely", "YTA \n\nYou are living there op, you can try and spin it anyway you want but you are living in the apartment and should be contributing somehow with the bills/rent \n\nHer excuse for her boyfriend is bs though", "Gonna go against the grain a bit here and go ESH. I agree with the majority of the YTA posts here, with the exception of the rent demand. You are basically half living there, and half living is living, but not every situation requires immediate rent payment. The rent part is what makes me say ESH because you are the significant other of one of the people that does live there and does pay half the rent, and your BF doesn't agree with this whole thing his sister is doing. All this to say nothing of the fact that you just straight up can't afford it, so it's basically her telling you to get out, which is a shitty thing to do to your brother and housemate's SO. That said, yeah, clean up around the place more and buy at least mostly your own food or cook group means for the house. You are still an advanced guest in the house, and that advancement means you should pull your weight, including with stuff that isn't within your stomping ground. So should your SIL's BF, but maybe don't push your luck on that front. That's a battle your BF should fight if it's gonna be fought at all.", "ESH. Youretherr more than half thr time, its right you should contribute, though I agree a third of the rent is too much. Work it out on a pro rata basis for the number of nights you do stay, help with the cleaning, and don't touch her food.", "NTA.  You\u2019re a guest in your boyfriend\u2019s home.  Ok, his sister now thinks you\u2019re there too much and she wants you to contribute by paying and cleaning.  You don\u2019t want to do that.  Ok, then she needs to deal with your boyfriend and leave you out of it.  You\u2019re not her guest you\u2019re his guest.  He is her room-mate.  She has her boyfriend stay over and he has his girlfriend (you) stay over.  So if something has changed and she thinks you\u2019re staying too many nights to be a guest and instead you\u2019re living there, she needs to take that up with him.  If I were him, I\u2019d counter with something like- ok, your boyfriend stays 3 nights a week and my girlfriend stays 4 nights a week ok I\u2019ll ask her to stay 3 nights and it will be even.

Being there 3-4 days is a lot. And even if OP is sequestered in BFs room, it still changes the overall environment. (I was in the same situation where my brothers gf hid out in his room and it most definitely affects the living arrangement). The sister making those demands is disproportionate and inappropriate. It should be negotiated with her brother. I think the proper solution is somewhere in the middle.", "She stays there for 3-4 days a week. Common courtesy would dictate she helps clean around the house. Secondly, she never gave an estimate of how long the sister\u2019s boyfriend stays over at the shared place a week. But to me, that's irrelevant. You're staying at someone else\u2019s place using their electricity, water, heat, food, and lodging for half the week for free. She's not a guest; she partially lives there regardless of her situation. To say she's a guest is an overstatement."]}
