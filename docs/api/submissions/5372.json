He was acting like he expected it too and was talking about how I'd need to be introduced to some of his friends and coworkers so when I invite them, they identify me as his daughter. I thought it was crazy. The man is not my parent and he's only family on a technicality but we are not close, we hardly see each other ever.\n\nI told my mom it wasn't going to happen. She went crazy and accused me of being ungrateful and told me I was being disrespectful and how could he not walk his kid down the aisle. I told him he could walk THEIR children down the aisle some day but he was never my parent and I was never his kid so he was not walking me. He was offended as hell.

He said if those things weren't appreciated then why did he even bother. Mom told me I should be worshiping the ground he walks on because he's been such a good dad. She called me selfish some more and then I just walked out and blocked her.

I am sad for you that you don't have a stepparent you can have the kind of relationship I had with my stepdad growing up (married my mom when I was ~5, divorced when I was ~8 but we still call each other family and I'm now 40), or my papa, the man my mom married when I was 22 and had just left for college--but that doesn't mean you owe it to anyone to pretend you do. Your mother is calling you ungrateful, while completely ignoring that it must be a complicated thing for you to not have your own father at your wedding, or that you might want his brother--likely the closest thing you have to your biological dad--to walk you down the aisle. It's neither disrespectful or strange to me in any way. The FOTB is a position of love and respect, not obligation. You don't have to have ANYONE walk you if you don't want to--simply because it's YOUR wedding. But being badgered into letting him do this just so it doesn't cause drama?

That statement alone makes me think he's the manipulative and abusive one, and your mother is either an enabler or abuser herself ... For what reason does she expect you should be \"worshipping the ground he walks on\"? Because he wasn't a horrible father to your siblings? Great.

I find it wild that anyone remotely sane would agree with your mother.", "NTA - Please print this out and mail to Mom and Stepdad. \nSo rude and disrespectful of them. Cringe. \nSorry you have to deal with this BS. Lame. \n\nI\u2019m am so irritated right now over this for you. Do you think it would sink in if they were to read this post? Or, are they so far gone that nothing would change them?", "NTA.  Your grandparents just sound like they're trying to placate and play the peacemakers in the family.\n\nYour mom sounds like she's trying to force this guy that you never really identified with into a position. That'll make him look better for some reason, even though this is a but your day and not hers.\n\nEspecially if you've already got a guy. You want to walk you down the aisle, there's no reason to have this person who you don't identify with to do it.\n\nObviously it'd be for the best if you could find some kind of compromise to this, but if you can't the end, it's your day.\n\nSo whether it be at the bride or the bridezilla, it matters not. It's your day and that's what matters, so do it your way!", "Ask him how much he\u2019s gonna be contributing to your wedding. As a FOB he should be help pay for your wedding", "NTA tell them sorry they are offended but it\u2019s your choice and they can like it or lump it. And your grandparents saying it would be \u2018kind\u2019 to let him do it? After this?? No freaking way!", "NTA. Holy wow. You owe him because he's nice to your mom and GAVE YOU SIBLINGS?! Wat. \ud83d\ude02 Him and your mom had a family. Fantastic. But that's nothing to do with you lmao. The audacity. I'm glad you have your uncle to walk you. They need to get over themselves.", "NTA at 17 you were already raised.. stand firm on your answer. No, is a complete sentence, simple as that. Your day, your happiness!!", "NTA. So you should give him that honor just because he married a women and had kids with her. Like marrying your mom is such a hardship you owe him for marrying her? They\u2019re delusional. Like seriously? \u201c i was a good husband to my wife and made babies so you owe me\u201d", "NTA  \n\n\nA (step)dad is voluntarily accepted by the child. If you don't see him as your parent (especially, given that he only became part of your life at 17 and never lived in the same place as you at the same time), I don't see why he would have a paternal role to you if you didn't accept him that way. On top of that, with the way he acts, he seems very entitled. \n\nIt is your decision, but I feel like having your uncle walk you down would be the better option. \n\nIt is YOUR (and your partner's) big day, not your mother's husband's (I probably messed up grammar with the apostrophes here somewhere), so you should do what makes YOU happy (including whether or not you want to invite certain people at all).", "So, let me get this straight. Your mother got married when you were 17. You never lived with him. You're grown, have gone to college and are getting married. He didn't raise you, provide for you, pay for college or anything else. You don't have a relationship with this guy, and yet you're TAH for not giving him the honor of walking you down the aisle on your wedding day??\n\nNope, sorry. NTA. He can do that for his own daughters when that time comes.", "NTA.   Do what you want, guilt free.  Sorry your mom and her husband are being so delusional.", "NTA and I want ALL the updates. You have so many good conversation starters to have with your mom, her parents, and your moms husband. Or just how it goes if you uninvite them all.\n\nAlso, having both your uncle and grandfather walk you down the aisle would be amazing. Or just uncle like you have planned. But the idea that you picked TWO people and neither was your mom's husband sounds *chefs kiss* to me.", "NTA he is an entitled asshole. What is \"kind\" to an asshole and what he should reasonably expect are two different things. He is your mother's husband and she is mistaking him for the father of the bride.", "NTA and you need to remind him he had NO hand in sending you to college. wtf is wrong with your mother? it's always weird to me when a parent tries to force a step parent on their kids. just fucking weird. and FUCK THAT let your uncle walk you down the aisle. your mother, her parents and this random ass man are being weird as fuck. Why do they care so much about his feelings over yours? It's literally YOUR wedding day. Do what will make YOU happy.", "Being kind to you does not deserve a trophy.  That's the absolute bare minimum someone should be to their spouses kids -- assuming they aren't toxic or destructive. Plus, that sort of entitlement isn't being kind, anyway.\n\nI also wonder:  Did you ever ASK for siblings?  At 17 I certainly wouldn't think of getting more siblings as any kind of favor.\n\nNTA", "NTA, it\u2019d be an AH move to say your uncle couldn\u2019t so the man that did nothing for you (cause taking care of your mom and giving you siblings has literally nothing to do with you and was for them, never for you) honestly after this mom would be uninvited if she couldn\u2019t accept your decision", "NTA. I literally whispered \u201cwhat the fuck\u201d. I mean I get respecting your stepparent to an extent because they take good care of your mom and any half siblings you have, but to demand that very personal and emotional honor when you were almost an adult and out of the house when she even met him, is insane. Your mom and stepdad very possibly just alienated you because of this and that would be your right. Let your grandparents know that either you have a specific person for that job in mind or you won\u2019t walk with anyone since the man who would\u2019ve been the one to walk you is gone. Maybe stating something like that outright instead of just saying you are refusing to walk with your stepdad will make them shut up.", "NTA! The way they responded is weird and manipulative, do not let that man walk you down the aisle he ain\u2019t done a damn thing for you, plus you know, he\u2019s not your dad!", "**NTA**\n\nHe never raised you, and you never lived with them, so there shouldn\u2019t be pressure for him to walk you down the aisle.\n\nYou have no obligation to appease them. Yeah it\u2019s great that he\u2019s been such a good husband to your mom and awesome dad to your siblings, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re required to treat him like a father when he wasn\u2019t a dad to you. \n\nThe wedding is for you and your fianc\u00e9, don\u2019t allow your family to pressure you into making your day about your mom and stepdad.", "NTA.  I like your uncle idea.  Why do people poke their nose into other peoples weddings so intimately??", "NTA. Your mom and her husband are bonkers and your poor grandparents have been taken hostage by the situation. It\u2019s your wedding. They can behave as they wish but don\u2019t bend to this crazy", "The weirdest part is that it's 2022. OP could have asked her Mom to walk her or had no one at all. You don't need a man to fulfill that role.", "[deleted]", ">I just wanna know if he\u2019s gonna stop taking care of the mom now since he\u2019s not doing anything else for OP.\n\nI wonder this too since he used \"helping the mother\" as a reason OP should be grateful to him! The level of entitlement and the disregard for OP's feelings is spectacular here. To have her mother blatantly disregard her feelings is just sad. Once OP said that she wasn't comfortable with him walking her down the aisle, the mother should have respected that. Instead, she has decided to wage war against OP and start a smear campaign against her by telling the grandparents. People who do this don't realize how harmful their behavior toward their child is. A person who has already lost one parent to death, now is pushed into a corner and forced to possibly lose the other one who is alive. That's just so cruel. I wish the mother would get counseling to see how negative her behavior  truly is.", "Hey, don't forget the time we passed by each other in the hallway and both nodded in greeting! Or last Friday when we made eye contact! Come on OP, that's gotta mean something to you!", "ROFL, maybe your mom was asking him for money to \"put you through college\" and secretly just pocketed it herself. NTA OP, time to consider going LC or NC.", "Wow. That is ridiculous. Where does you mom and her husband get their ideas from?", "That makes it a lot simpler. I\u2019d just tell them \u201cno\u201d. He gets to sit in an honored position with your mom, right? That should be enough.", "Life should be simpler than this.  This is YOUR wedding, and you do not need stress from your mom and her husband.  YOU need to handle all invitations, save the dates, etc.  Give your mother the number of guests she's allowed to invite and DON'T BUDGE.  This day is about you.  Not them.", "It was!", "A homeless guy who was on the street begging. Offer to pay him. I'm sure he'll appreciate the free meal at the reception too.", "I can see it now: you send those friends and coworkers invites and then the following week there will be letters flowing into Dear Abby asking about the money-grubbing invite from a coworker\u2019s step daughter they had never heard of until now!", "Huh? OK are you responding to my comment?", "Wait, that's... not how people fall in love??", "Could also be why the mom is freaking out now...the jig is up!", "Please no!", "But you'd have to meet them a few times first so that they'd know who you are in relation to him. Those ones?", "Perfection!", "Warned me that my shoe lace was untied. Saved my life he did.", "IDK, every wedding I've ever been to, they say who gives this woman in marriage....", "Bet. Thats probably it. He has probably been lying for awhile saying he raised that girl when he didnt do anything and now is playing catch up to his lies.", "The thick plottens.", "it was *heavily* implied, what are you on about?", "Your english really is great. I'm so impressed with people knowing a non-native language. Its just so much work and so confusing.", "Greetings from America! I would never have guessed you\u2019re from Finland. English can be complicated and nonsensical so it\u2019s impressive when a non-native speaker can express themselves so well. Nice work!", "They meant what they said, good sir.", "This is probably going to be an unpopular comment, but I\u2019ve always felt that the tradition of walking the bride down the isle to her new husband is really sexist. I feel like it\u2019s saying she is property that I am giving away.  When I got married, my daughter, fianc\u00e9, and myself walked down the aisle together to where our minister was waiting. We figured we were all in it together.", "Why is there such a huge gap on who paid for your college? Either he did or he didn't. I would have dead stopped him right there and told him who did pay for it and look him in the eyes over it. Weird.", "I don't think the step-dad *actually believes* that's what the relationship is like, it's just that he's lied about it to everyone he knows for so long that he needs OP to back it up to save face.", "Tell him that you had a change of heart. \n\nTell him you want him to he involved in the ceremony. \n\nBut tell him you want an extravagant Indian style wedding and his job is to procure the elephant that you\u2019re going to ride down the aisle. \n\nAlso tell him that he\u2019s responsible for paying the husbands dowry. He should have no problem supporting someone who\u2019s done fuck all for him considering his personal views.", "That threw me. \u201cI married you\u2019re mom for YOU!

NTA.", "The more of your responses I read, the more I think you need to have a sit down with this chap and talk to him.\n\nI say him, cause I think your mama might be hiding things", "I\u2019m am wondering if your mother lied to him and said she was paying for your college and he helped but she kept the money for herself. Maybe that\u2019s why he thinks he paid for your college.", "Honestly, ask him directly about any college money he may have given your mom.", "Eh, I downvoted for the history lesson. It's unnecessary and irrelevant, and obviously the tradition is important to OP since she stated in the post that her uncle is walking her down the aisle.", "\u201cI was responsible for the family I created with your mother, you should be so grateful to me for it!!!\u201d", "This part I would ask him just what in the all that is stupid does that even mean? What does you marrying my mom and knocking her up have to do with you walking me down the aisle? Make it make sense PLEASE", "anything's possible after reading enough of these posts :|", "Ridiculous", "Screams Hallmark Movie to me.", "Not a bad idea to dig a little there. Is it possible that your mother has gotten between his attempts to help and your receipt of said assistance? We had some weirdness like that in my family. I don't remember who the parties were, but someone offered to help and an intermediary never passed it along. It was money, for sure.", "0 to 100 XD but understandable, reddit do this to people", "This made me laugh way too hard.", "I thought of that as well. No more having sex with his wife to give OP siblings!", "Thanks. While that thought did cross my mind, I was able to avoid the visuals until your comment. OP is definitely NTA here, but her mother is delusional AF about her husbands role in OPs life.

I had grown up around them, saw them at our house regularly, played with their kids, the whole shebang. As I became an adult those folks were my friends, too! \n\nI know that there was a time (and still is in some places) when weddings were a Major Social Event put on by the bride\u2019s parents. The bride and groom really had little say in it. Most of the guests were friends and coworkers of the fathers, particularly of the bride\u2019s father. That started changing in the late 60s and early 70s. It rightfully became centered on the bride and groom (do you hear me bridezillas?

The fact that OP would have to be introduced to people so they would connect them as father daughter is a 2 huge red flags. 1 they obviously don't have any relationship and he doesn't see her as a daughter cause he would have mentioned her at work and there would have usually been some form of cross over by now of even just a photo \"Hey these are my kids (with OP in the photos)\" and 2 is OPs mun expecting OP to invite all these random strangers to her wedding just because they work with OPs mothers husband?
