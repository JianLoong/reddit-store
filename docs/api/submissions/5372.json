Though they were both very young so maybe she didn't give a shit about him and only married him because she got pregnant. IDK. But she was talking about her husband. He was acting like he expected it too and was talking about how I'd need to be introduced to some of his friends and coworkers so when I invite them, they identify me as his daughter. I thought it was crazy. The man is not my parent and he's only family on a technicality but we are not close, we hardly see each other ever.\n\nI told my mom it wasn't going to happen. She went crazy and accused me of being ungrateful and told me I was being disrespectful and how could he not walk his kid down the aisle. I told him he could walk THEIR children down the aisle some day but he was never my parent and I was never his kid so he was not walking me. He was offended as hell.

He said if those things weren't appreciated then why did he even bother. Mom told me I should be worshiping the ground he walks on because he's been such a good dad. She called me selfish some more and then I just walked out and blocked her. But she told my grandparents (her parents) and they asked could I do it to show I appreciate him for being there for mom and for being kind to me.

This is final. \n\n\n\nNow, this is tricky, but, if you feel comfortable with this possibility, let them know you will understand if they don\u2019t want to go if either of them are uncomfortable with this. Tell mum you\u2019ll miss her, but you\u2019ll understand. \n\n\n\nAnd I would tell the grandparents yes, it would be kind, but this is a life changing event for you, and you wish to honour the people who are close/important to you. This guy is not that important, he had no real interaction with you and thus he\u2019s a guest. You respect their PoV, love them, but won\u2019t change your position in this case.", "I wish you and your uncle a very wonderful walk down the aisle! NTA but your mothers husband sure is.", "Is there any possible way your mother was given money \"for your college\" from him?", "Hell, let us all do it. A hundred random strangers.", "> It actually would be pretty funny to have a complete stranger walk you down the aisle instead of mom's husband.\n\nOr, it would really be not funny, but a statement of what a strong, independent young woman that OP has become if she would just walk herself down the aisle to her new life, not as property to be \"given away\".", "This doesn\u2019t seem that weird to me though. When I was making the guest list to my wedding, I got a list from my parents of who they wanted to invite and a list from my future in laws of all the family/friends they wanted invited. I would expect OP to ask her mom who they wanted invited and that would include her husband\u2019s friend/family. Ultimately it is OP\u2019s decision\n\nNot saying OP should, I just don\u2019t think it was that weird of an expectation.", ">He said he took care of my mom and gave me siblings and he put me through college (he didn't). He said if those things weren't appreciated then why did he even bother.\n\nWhy bother taking care of mum and raising his own children if *you* don't appreciate it... Whelp, might as well abandon them now.", "I think you meant NTA. Y T A is you're the asshole and OP doesn't need to give these people invites for themselves let alone their own party of people the couple doesn't know. \n\nOP said in a comment her uncle will be walking her and I think that will be beautiful. Your 'step' dad sounds fantastic and it makes me so happy to see good family dynamics like that.", "She has her uncle- her father's brother doing the honor, which is perfect OP.\n\nNTA, but your mom and husband are. Talk about entitlement!", "(Psst, I think you typed your judgement wrong!)", "I think you mean NTA. As do I.", "Already chose Paternal Uncle to stand in for late Father.", "It could be possible.", "I think that's a great idea! I did that with both my parents, my mom was so excited when I told her I wanted her to walk me down with my dad", "It's possible.", "There is nowhere that shows she had \"seething anger\" towards this guy until the wedding issue came up and they lied to her about his role in her life. She still doesn't appear to be seething.", "She literally called him a nice guy who treated her mom and her siblings well, before all of this mess happened. Idk how you get seething anger from that. There\u2019s no reason for her to honor somebody who hasn\u2019t contributed anything to her life. He received enough honor by being invited to the wedding and thats all that he should have expected. Him being the father of her siblings doesn\u2019t mean that she owes him a thing.", "This man is worthy!", "Lol why would you invite any of his friends or *colleagues*? He's there as a \"plus one,\" he doesn't get to bring Bill from accounts receivable.", "That just left me gobsmacked, the fact that he expected you to not only invite them, but you have to introduced to them, so that they know who you are.\n\nSeriously, don't allow this toxic man anywhere near your wedding.", "Girl, if I were you I would just elope. Too much drama", "My husband\u2019s parents (bio, still together) paid for our whole wedding and didn\u2019t even try to invite random coworkers and friends.. That is so weird that STEP dad, who never raised OP and is contributing nothing to the wedding, is trying to do so. NTA", "So he wants you to cough up hundreds or thousands of dollars to entertain his people?  Man, what an asshole.  NTA.  He can host his OWN party with his OWN $$$.", "Yeah, they don\u2019t get invites. You might want to let the venue know there may be some crashes trying to show up.", "He seems like the type who wants to be the center of attention at the expense of others.\n\nThat he claims he paid for your college education, when he in fact didn't, says a lot about him. It makes me curious what other lies he's told.\n\nAlso makes me wonder if he already bragged to everyone he was \"walking his daughter down the aisle\" and that's why they are now waging this bizarre campaign to force you into it.", "I had the same thought than a commenter below. Maybe they framed him in their circle as someone who stepped up for you, and so they need the wedding to reflect that, otherwise it doesn't make them look good?\n\nIn any case, definitely NTA. Please don't let them ruin your big day, and do as you wish.", "They've had more time around him, I'd imagine. He's been their son-in-law for however many years it's been, and he is the father of at least some of their grandchildren. Emotionally, him being the father of some of their grandchildren = all of their grandchildren.\n\nI'm guessing you were living with paternal grandparents when she met and married him?", "Is he paying for any of the wedding?", "OP said in another comment that she already asked her dad's brother. Paternal grandfather was also a consideration but he suggested she have her uncle do it instead.\n\nThe stepdad should be given zero roles&recognition in that wedding. And if OP has to introduce him, then she introduces him as her \"mum's husband\" \ud83d\ude01", "Thank you for saying this. At my wedding, I walked alone. No one owns me, no one gives me away.", "I think it's worth having the conversation. I wonder if some drama will be uncovered there, such as your mom getting money from him for your college or lying to him about where her own money was going.", "Well noooow I am wondering if your mom asked money of him, under the guise that it was for you. She may be insistent so possible lies don't come undone.", "No. Because he's done enough and paid for her college already. Geez! /s \ud83d\ude02", "I would probably try to get that info from him because either he's lost his mind or he thinks he was helping his partner support her daughter.\nFinancial support does not equate father status, but many people get those ideas confused.", "That's fair.\n\nI was working in shipping during the pandemic and I've gotten used to \"apologising\" to clients for stupid things that are out of my control to diffuse tense situations. Might not be the best approach outside of work to be fair. \n\nI want to make it really clear though that when I say \"apology\" I really mean guilt trip. There's no need to walk or egg shells, follow up or accommodate them at all. It's not a sincere apology. \n\nLike \"I'm sorry we aren't close\" then go on to explain how it's entirely their fault.\n Then go to say something along the lines of 'I would leave liked to be closer but I feel that my relationship was neglected for such a long time that it will be very hard to that build that bond now\".\n\nwhich actually means \"I was still technically a kid when you came into my life and you should've put in the effort at  the start. it's probably too late have any kind of relationship now and even if we did, it should be down to you to fix it and you shouldn't expect much from me.\"", "This is important. It seems to be the reason OP\u2019s mom\u2019s husband (let\u2019s call him A, for Asshole) is even interested in playing father of the bride. A, probably: \u201cI did sooooo well y\u2019all, stepped up for this young mom and widow and gave her a second chance on life! I was kind to her first kid. What do you mean being kind to family is the bare minimum/default starting point?!\u201d A must want to show off his Good Deed at OP\u2019s wedding. In my parents\u2019 culture, weddings are more communal and if I get married, my dad will want to (and be able to) invite some friends. Granted, he\u2019ll offer to pay for any expenses associated with this, but I wouldn\u2019t mind because he is my actual father. A has nothing but audacity connecting him to FATB status.", ">Because if he invites his colleagues to OP's wedding then they have to invite him to their \"family's\" weddings. And he gets free food(I bet he gives lousy gifts.  A spatula off the gift registry, if one is lucky)", "I thought that too. As a general rule, people who won't recognize the bride or groom do not get an invite (plus ones excepted)", "I mean if they don\u2019t know who OP is\u2026isn\u2019t that a kinda big sign that they\u2019re not really part of each others\u2019 slaves,", "Truth! Call your uncle, and your fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents. Knock this thing out in an afternoon, and get done. Have somebody video it and put it on Facebook with a \u201cdonate now \u201c button.", "Your English is very good. I understood you very well.", "He's also claiming to have put her through college.\n\nIf she was living with the other set of grandparents, they might not know how she paid for college and if he's bold enough to say it to her face, he's probably said it to others like her maternal grandparents.", "I was living with mom when she met him but when he moved in and she married him, I was living with my paternal grandparents, yes.", "He's not.", "My husband and I walked down the aisle together. It was our relationship and our wedding.", "Exactly! \ud83d\udcaf", "I don't think Mom was even that young if she knew Step Dud for five months before marrying him and OP was 17 and already out of the house.", "Thank you, that\u2019s nice to hear! I read lots of books in English and watch tv shows, but sometimes I just don\u2019t know if I express myself well (especially in a serious topic like somebody passed away). But I guess it\u2019s enough if people understand what I mean \ud83e\udd17 Greetings from Finland", "\"Step Dud\". Best typo ever!"]}
