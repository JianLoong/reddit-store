He's an okay guy but I don't love him or feel particularly close to him. He's just my mom's husband and the father to my half siblings she had with him once I was already moved out.\n\nMy mom has apparently decided though, that he has done \"so much for me\" that I should be making him FOTB at my wedding and have him walk me down the aisle. My dad died when I was still a baby so mom doesn't count him, even though they were married and everything. Though they were both very young so maybe she didn't give a shit about him and only married him because she got pregnant. IDK. But she was talking about her husband. He was acting like he expected it too and was talking about how I'd need to be introduced to some of his friends and coworkers so when I invite them, they identify me as his daughter. I thought it was crazy. The man is not my parent and he's only family on a technicality but we are not close, we hardly see each other ever.\n\nI told my mom it wasn't going to happen. She went crazy and accused me of being ungrateful and told me I was being disrespectful and how could he not walk his kid down the aisle. I told him he could walk THEIR children down the aisle some day but he was never my parent and I was never his kid so he was not walking me. He was offended as hell. He told me he'd never do anything for me again. I asked him what he had done. He said he took care of my mom and gave me siblings and he put me through college (he didn't). He said if those things weren't appreciated then why did he even bother. Mom told me I should be worshiping the ground he walks on because he's been such a good dad. She called me selfish some more and then I just walked out and blocked her. But she told my grandparents (her parents) and they asked could I do it to show I appreciate him for being there for mom and for being kind to me.

They barely have any relationship.\n\n>Just so they don't think its personal\n\nThey make it personal.\n\n>so that they're aware that he needs to work on your relationship if he wants to be considered your dad.\n\nWhy are you putting words in OPs mouth? They don't have any kind of relationship and it seems like OP doesn't need another father.\n\n>Edit: to be blunt the \"apology\" should really just be criticism disguised as an apology so they don't get more angry and try to ruin the wedding or whatever\n\nThey can also be uninvited if they try something like that.

Not because he thought I had nobody but because he feels I owe it to him. But he was never my parent, he never took care of me, he had no hand in raising or supporting me financially. He is simply the man married to my mother. We have hardly spent any time together so I find it very hard to believe he has this great love for me as his own daughter. To me it appeared like he felt he was entitled from the second he married my mother, regardless of whether he knows me well or not.", "Really, too harsh? They're insisting he did everything for her when he's done nothing and came at her strong. So she came back and firmly shut that crap down. How is that harsh?", "Are you the husband in question? Because otherwise your comment makes no sense.", "Damn, your comment makes no sense.\n\n>But I do think you were too harsh about telling him.\n\nHow tho? They have no relationship and her mother's partner is not pleasant to OP. \n\n>He might have thought he was doing you a kindness since you can't have your father there and it was kind of mean the way you declined the offer.\n\nNo, it wasn't. It is OPs wedding and they have no say in her decisions. It doesn't matter what his purpose was. It wasn't from kindness as they still want to force OP to let him be father of the bride.\n\n>Especially if he's never been mean or abusive to you, and from what you've said it seems like his biggest offense is just not being close because of your age. \n\nThat's his problem. OP was an young adult when her mother met him and they have no relationship if you could read the post correctly. \n\n>Maybe you're upset because it feels like your mom is trying to force you to replace your dad with him, because she is and that's shitty, but it's not his fault you know?\n\nYes, it is also his fault because he takes an active part in this entire problem. OP doesn't need to treat him as a parent.\n\n>He is your step-father, legally at least, and clearly he views you as more or less of a daughter.\n\nAgain. OP have not been even living in the same house with him. They don't have any kind of good relationship. His views doesn't matter. \n\n>You don't owe him any favors obviously but you could have just said you appreciate the offer but you prefer if your uncle does it to have that connection to your father.\n\nShe did that yet they still try to force his role as a father of the bride and they get mad when OP refuses. \n\nNTA", "Nope, they're not contributing money to the wedding.", "My fiance and I are, with some money being given by my paternal family.", "That makes no difference", "I'm engaged and my fiance doesn't have much of an opinion because he knows my mom's husband less than I do.", "Nothing would surprise me after the wtf kinda shock I got when they came out with that.

It was always my uncle and my grandpa who were contenders for the role.", "It actually would be pretty funny to have a complete stranger walk you down the aisle instead of mom's husband.

You don't actually have to want to work on the relationship, it's just to make op look like the bigger person so they calm down and back off.\n\n but I could've made that clearer in hindsight but I didn't want to assume op definitely didn't want to try, I was like 98% sure op didn't want anything to do with him but they must've been close enough to have the conversation so I didn't want to be blunt and say \"pretend to be sorry\".\nI went too hard in the other direction and made it sound like she should definitely work on the relationship instead.
