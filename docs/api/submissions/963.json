You get the top sheet and the bottom sheet sticks to the piece. You've then got 1hr to take your half of the tag up to the register, pay for the item and go show the receipt to an employee back in that section. Once you show them it's been paid for, they'll mark it as paid and pull it off the floor as soon as they can. If you change your mind and end up not deciding to buy it, the sold tag will be removed.

OP kind of took advantage of checking out first to buy an item claimed by someone else. I\u2019m likening this to the type of item that\u2019s stored behind a counter. The woman effectively asked for it to be brought to the front so she could buy it, but had to finish up getting some other things. OP went to pay for their purchases, saw the item that was supposed to be for this woman (but wasn\u2019t paid for yet and the cashier didn\u2019t know who it was for) and asked to buy it.

If the bottom half was gone, that was it, no purchase for anyone else but the person that had that bottom tag. If no one bought it, you had to wait until the next day when the item would be retagged. We were pretty strict about it, and as for OP, no tag meant that the staff did something wrong in selling it, and if the manager was going to hold it, she should have tagged it as a hold.

The buyer was literally there at the store buying it. If they decide to avoid dealing with someone who participates in upsetting other customers by buying things out from under other customers, it's their choice because OP returning might upset even more customers than the money they would gain from OP. Either OP or the other purchaser was going to be upset. OP is one person; once she is upset, the maximum upset people is one. Everybody else is significantly more than one person. If one person is upset, and let's say OP returns and undercuts someone else again, that will be another person upset. That's already double the maximum people upset. It's a business decision made on business logic that upsetting OP or banning OP is a better decision than upsetting one other person and who knows how many more other customers in the future.

It really is just one of those things though that someone else came in at JUST the right/wrong time wanting to buy the same large item that you can\u2019t just pick up and walk around with! \n\nThe lady was understandably frustrated that the table she\u2019d just agreed with the manager to buy was sold to someone else, she could have approached OP in a \u2018ha ha, funny story about that table there\u2019 way but probably just reacted in the moment.

First, who shops without money and secondly she did not even ask them to be reserved she just hid them.

You clearly wanted the table also, and it\u2019s the manager\u2019s fault for not making it clear that the item was on hold so you did nothing wrong by not returning it. A bit entitled to be mad at someone for buying something that was on hold instead of being mad at the staff for lying to you about holding onto it for you.", "NTA. It was the thrift stores negligence to blame. Enjoy the", "NTA. No sold tag on the piece indicates it was not sold yet. You picked it out and paid for it immediately, so it's yours. NTA here.", "NTA. The store's negligence is to blame. Enjoy your furniture.", "When I worked for Goodwill, our store refused to hold or reserve items. You paid for it and you walked out the door with it. If you had to call around and find a friend with a truck to transport it and someone else bought it in that time and was prepared to take it, you were entirely out of luck. If you weren't prepared to walk out the door immediately, we wouldn't even sell it to you. I'll admit that policy pissed off a fair few people, but it did prevent things like this...though I will admit that this situation may have happened if it was a regular customer who wanted to buy it. Regulars did have some level of influence over stuff like that. \n\nSo, as a former thrift store employee I declare you NTA and the table fair game. Enjoy your loot!", "What is wrong with this thrift store like at least you know move it aside or put a tag on it not just leave it there for people so see without a tag or any implication that it is on hold NTA at all", "NTA.  I get that the lady is upset because the manager said she would put the table aside and then failed to do so.  I get that you rightly purchased the table and want to keep it.  So far you two are in the clear.  The AH is this story is the manager who failed to do their job, and then when their mistake is revealed, decides that the way to handle it is to ban you from the store when you did nothing wrong.  I TRULY hope you escalate this above the manager's head.  Instead of taking ownership of their fuckup, they are trying to blame a customer.", "NTA.  100% the manager's fault for not putting a HOLD or SOLD note on it.", "That is 100% the stores fault and the item is yours fair and square. NTA", "NTA and I would even go so far as to contacting the owner to inform them of the situation. The manager can't ban you for keeping something that was paid for and not marked on hold.", "NTA. Approaching someone with a temper and yelling isnt the way to ask a complete stranger for a favor. The manager made the mistake. I would be inclined to complain about the manager threatening you with being banned for taking an item you paid for.", "You should\u2019ve sold it to that woman, triple what you paid for it.", "NTA!!! Loved the \"Nope'd out\" lol", "Yeah, this is like when an airline double books, it's on *them* to make it right. NTA.", "Their mistake is not your emergency NTA", "I knew someone who was banned from a store for something stupid and lost a bunch of weight, went back in, and it was like she was never banned.", "If it's a small local place then it may be easier to remember than you'd think.\n\nBut yes, typically this is why it takes so much to get banned/trespassed from a store.", "And the nature of thrift shopping is that the stock is constantly changing, for all anyone knows an even better table could have been on the floor next week. Above and beyond customer service could have been to offer to call OP when a similar item comes in, which it inevitably will.", "Hehe, that's awesome. I would hate to get banned from antique shops near me, I love looking at all the treasures.", "NTA", "NTA, the manager should have managed their store better. She hadn\u2019t paid for it, no label on it and no other staff member knew about it. Bad communication on the manager\u2019s side; manager at fault.", "No. The store screwed up. That are the aholes for letting you take the blame.", "Legally not an AH but still an AH. They put it on hold for her. I don't see why it's so hard to give it back to her.", "You got banned because of their mistakes, I found that funny ass hell \ud83e\udd0c", "What!! NTA but that manager is Jeesh. How dare they ban you for THEIR  mistake. Idiots.", "NTA, the lady was too slow, should\u2019ve bought it right away and not put the table on hold \ud83d\ude04", "NTA. Be spiteful and petty and go back next weekend.", "YTA.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong.  The manager screwed up and let the customer blame you, then the manager blamed and threatened you\u2026. And expected you to play nice?", "OP might find something else they want in the future\u2026. But now they\u2019re banned", "Yes.  The manager blamed OP for the mistake, allowed the lady to harass OP, and then was very aggressive and actually threatened OP!  Did the manager think OP was going to be like\u2026. Oh sorry, you\u2019re totally right, MY MISTAKE, here\u2019s the table back?"]}
