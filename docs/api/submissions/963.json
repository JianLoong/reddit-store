You get the top sheet and the bottom sheet sticks to the piece. You've then got 1hr to take your half of the tag up to the register, pay for the item and go show the receipt to an employee back in that section. Once you show them it's been paid for, they'll mark it as paid and pull it off the floor as soon as they can. If you change your mind and end up not deciding to buy it, the sold tag will be removed.

OP kind of took advantage of checking out first to buy an item claimed by someone else. I\u2019m likening this to the type of item that\u2019s stored behind a counter. The woman effectively asked for it to be brought to the front so she could buy it, but had to finish up getting some other things. OP went to pay for their purchases, saw the item that was supposed to be for this woman (but wasn\u2019t paid for yet and the cashier didn\u2019t know who it was for) and asked to buy it.

If the bottom half was gone, that was it, no purchase for anyone else but the person that had that bottom tag. If no one bought it, you had to wait until the next day when the item would be retagged. We were pretty strict about it, and as for OP, no tag meant that the staff did something wrong in selling it, and if the manager was going to hold it, she should have tagged it as a hold.

The buyer was literally there at the store buying it. If they decide to avoid dealing with someone who participates in upsetting other customers by buying things out from under other customers, it's their choice because OP returning might upset even more customers than the money they would gain from OP. Either OP or the other purchaser was going to be upset. OP is one person; once she is upset, the maximum upset people is one. Everybody else is significantly more than one person. If one person is upset, and let's say OP returns and undercuts someone else again, that will be another person upset. That's already double the maximum people upset. It's a business decision made on business logic that upsetting OP or banning OP is a better decision than upsetting one other person and who knows how many more other customers in the future. They would rather eat the loss on upsetting OP than eat the loss on the number of other people OP would upset in the future on top of the one upset now. \n\nThis is a real simple question with a clear binary option, because you can't go back in time, so just answer the binary question honestly: Is it better to have a bad reputation from one customer or is it better to have a bad reputation from one or more customers?", "It's not \"taking advantage\" if she's the one who followed the store's policy.

He looked at me with my hand still on the table, asked me if I was buying it, and knew what the other woman was up to. The table was mine, and the woman was ticked that her evil plan had been thwarted! To prevent an all-out war, the manager immediately picked up the table, stayed with me while I paid for it, and moved it into my car. Score! \n\nGood thrift store managers are worth their weight in gold.\n\nAfterthought: That table stunk from cigarette smoke all the way home and I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake in buying it.
