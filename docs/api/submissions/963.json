Like you said, she should've paid for it in advance to hold it if she wanted it. The manager is also the a-hole for botching up everything and having the nerve to try to pin it on you and ban you from the store? You should have a talk with the owner about how they treated an actual PAYING customer.", "NTA. You snooze you lose. This is why I go thrifting with someone so one person stands guard while the other runs to the front to pay. Then we finish shopping for anything else we may want. \n\nThey created the situation and it was not your job to fix it. I hope you find an even better spot to thrift at!", "NTA\n\nManager is trying to cover her ass in front of the other customer- it's very likely they're the thrift store version of a whale (someone who spends a lot of money).", "NTA. So let me get this right, the manager is going to BAN you for being a paying customer? Yeah, no. \n\nThis is not a you problem. You bought it, therefore you own it. The manager screwed up twice by not properly marking the merch/communicating with the staff and then by trying to make the problem yours after the deal was done.  \n\nThe good news is there are nearly an infinite number of thrift stores out there. So being \"banned\" from this one shouldn't crimp your style.", "NTA. That was all on the store, not you. They fucked up, not you. If you\u2019re banned then fuck them. There are other thrift stores.", "NTA.  As soon as the store employees accepted your money, the table belonged to you.", "NTA. The store manager made a mistake. Rather than own up to it she decided to try to make it out to be your fault.\n\nI bet in a month she won\u2019t remember your face to know she banned you from the store.", "NTA. IDK about your thrift store, but I used to work at a thrift store, and the items employees wanted never even left the back room. If something was already on the floor when we arrived and we wanted to buy it, we could just go put it in the back with our name on it. Or get someone to help move it if it was large furniture. We had the Sold tags for furniture easily available both at the counter and in the back. This manager is definitely the AH here, both for the way she treated you, and for not having a good method for her employees to put items on hold.", "NTA\n\nI would actually leave a review about the store. They essentially threatened you when you did nothing wrong", "NTA - this is what I love about thrifiting. You never know what you're getting and whoever sees it first, get it first. Sucks that the manager forgot to put a tag on it, but that isn't your fault OP and that lady needs to know that sometimes, things doesn't go her way and maybe things aren't meant to be. Maybe if she acted a little but more respectful, she'd be blessed by the thrift gods with an even better table.", "NTA. Paid wins.", "NTA\u2026 i teach and they always say have documentation or it didn\u2019t happen. No sign or note saying it\u2019s on hold, means it\u2019s fair game for purchase by anyone else. You have a receipt showing ownership, so that other customer snoozed and lost.", "NTA. Lady should be giving a hard time to manager and not you. She messed up. Please enjoy your furniture and don't think twice about this.", "At the thrift store near me, the employees keep little duplicate paper \"sold\" tags in their apron pocket. If you want an item that is too large/heavy to pick up and carry to the register, you flag someone down and they fill out one of the tags with your name, the price, and the time. You get the top sheet and the bottom sheet sticks to the piece. You've then got 1hr to take your half of the tag up to the register, pay for the item and go show the receipt to an employee back in that section. Once you show them it's been paid for, they'll mark it as paid and pull it off the floor as soon as they can. If you change your mind and end up not deciding to buy it, the sold tag will be removed. By the same token, if you see something you like with a tag more than an hour old and hasn't been paid for, the item is now fair game.", "Exactly, it would even work if the manager had put it on hold told other employees at least, that way they could tell other customers it was unavailable. obviously that was not the case though. And I\u2019d be so mad if a manager treated me like that they should not be managing the store if they\u2019re gonna act like that", "Manager is a she.", "The lady is definitely an AH because who just starts screaming at someone rather than just talking to them? It was obviously a mistake.", "I have had people follow me around hoping I would put an item I had back...lol", "Ah yes. Capitalism via the Dibbs system.", "Missed opportunity to make op (who, you know, actually paid for the item) a lifetime customer. So short sighted.", "Great point! You should review and if you know that manager\u2019s name, you should drop it in there. You protect others from the same potentially embarrassing and uncomfortable position, meanwhile it holds the manager accountable for an afternoon that they might think they got away with.\n\nNTA", "It could be them holding it while she gets a way to transport it. The manager screwed up big time.", "Sounds like the manager gave the lady bad info.", "Maybe she was just finishing up the rest of her shopping before looking around. The manager didn\u2019t bother to take the tag until she paid, but someone else bought it while she was grabbing a few other things. She probably had a legitimate claim to have called dibs on it, but the store messed up due to a coincidence of someone else coming in and wanting it before she checked out.", "I'm sorry, but this thrift store works on the Assumption System. Op is clearly at fault /s", "Yea the manager should have offered the lady a great deal on another table, not ban OP lol", "Ex wife has a family member that \"volunteered\" at a Goodwill store.  The workers would get first pick over everything, then call family and friends, then put stuff out on the sales floor.\n\nMy bet is that the manager was friends with or related to the AH customer in this scenario.", "Since she was there and came out of the store after OP, it\u2019s likely that she was in the store shopping at the same time as OP and had told the manager she was going to take that table. The manager didn\u2019t immediately mark it, and then someone came it and bought it while the woman was finishing up her shopping.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely the store\u2019s fault for messing this up, but makes me feel more sorry for this woman. OP kind of took advantage of checking out first to buy an item claimed by someone else. I\u2019m likening this to the type of item that\u2019s stored behind a counter. The woman effectively asked for it to be brought to the front so she could buy it, but had to finish up getting some other things. OP went to pay for their purchases, saw the item that was supposed to be for this woman (but wasn\u2019t paid for yet and the cashier didn\u2019t know who it was for) and asked to buy it. The cashier then sold it, and OP was quickly informed of the mistake, but decided to take advantage of it.", "Exactly. How DARE op. Come here to this store. And spend money. Like a customer!", "It's a local thrift store, there is no \"corporate\" to call. She could maybe call the owner of the store, but it's probably not worth the hassle.", "The lady came out super angry and yelled at OP. I wouldn't react kindly in that situation either. Maybe if she approached her calmly, she would've considered returning the table.", "As an F you, OP should offer it to her for double the price for a tidy profit \ud83d\ude02", "Thanks. Edited it!", "If that was the case, then the manager should have brought it up to the front and told the cashier that someone was coming to pay for it when they finished their shopping. OP didn't do anything wrong here.", "More concerned with saving face personally because she forgot to mark it than doing good business.", "Dang the thrift store that I was an employee at (local one not goodwill) they made us wait until an item was on the floor for 8 hours before we bought something. Only thing we got was a heads up on where something would be located in the store sometimes", "I actually worked at Goodwill for several years. Each district can have different policies about sales to the staff. For us, you had to purchase prior to your shift or wait a half hour after clocking out to buy. We also had furniture tags that were placed on furniture where the bottom half was the customer ticket and the top half stayed on the item. If the bottom half was gone, that was it, no purchase for anyone else but the person that had that bottom tag. If no one bought it, you had to wait until the next day when the item would be retagged. We were pretty strict about it, and as for OP, no tag meant that the staff did something wrong in selling it, and if the manager was going to hold it, she should have tagged it as a hold. Both customers were put in a bad situation by the staff, but OP had the right to the item, she'd paid for it. Once it's in her possession, she's got no obligation to give it back.", "I don\u2019t think you read the post. It\u2019s a table, not behind the counter or something near check out. It had no indication that it was already sold or reserved for someone. Other employees helped him buy it and move it to the car. It\u2019s on the manager for not marking the item as unavailable. Her mistake was unknown to OP until they had left the store. At that point OP is the rightful owner and has every right to leave.", "What in the world? That was not even mentioned in the thread?", "How on earth did op take advantage? The item was listed as being for sale. Op purchased the item. \n\nAt no point did op have knowledge of this other shopper or their intentions to purchase anything.", "OMG YESS that\u2019s 100% what I would do. Really throw it in their faces lmfao, it\u2019s OPs property at that point anyway lol!!!", "I like your style", "it can be if your taxidermist doesn\u2019t ask too many questions", "Ok that\u2019s legit funny"]}
