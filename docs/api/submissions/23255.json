We planned en-route to stop at a pub to get some lunch. We met at the wider family at the pub and were going to sit at one big table and share a meal. We rarely spend time together in this way.\n\nThere were four car-loads of different parts of the family all going to the same holiday destination. The problem is, my favourite meal at the pub (a chain pub that has roughly the same meals across the country) and one that I had been looking forward to, had crisps (potato chips in most other places) as part of the meal I really wanted: wraps. I am a fussy eater and little else on the menu appealed to me.\n\nI love the wraps at this place and I love the crisps that comes with the wraps. The wrap isn't that big and to get my money's worth, and to ensure I was full, I wanted to eat both the wrap and the crisps. I didn't want to waste part of the meal by not having the crisps.\n\nNow for the problem: My sister and her husband had also arranged to meet us at the pub. They too were travelling to the campsite. But her husband has a serious aversion to crisps. We don't know why, but we suspect something happened when he was at school, possibly involving a bullying incident and crisps. But we don't nkow. He has never told us why he can't be around them. He refuses to explain.\n\nHe seriously struggles to be around crisps. The noise, smell or sight of them has him freaking out. In the shops he can't even walk down the crisp aisle. Because of my aforementioned hunger and not wanting to waste food, I decided that, with her agreement, myself and my wife would go and eat at a table away from the rest of the family, so as to avoid my brother in law freaking out about the crisps. I had then planned to rejoin the family at their table afterwards. We did this.\n\nAfterwards I was castiagted by almost everyone for being antisocial and selfish and some told me they'd never go on holiday with me again because of my actions. They said I should have chose another meal option or just ordered the wrap without crisps.\n\nAITA for wanting to not waste part of my meal and forego the crisps option when I knew my brother in law has some very big issues with them?", "created_utc": 1690463746, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15b1mxp/aita_for_wanting_to_eat_potato_chipscrisps_when/", "score": 1501, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You just unlocked the secret to spending holidays free of overstepping control freaks. Go forth and enjoy your peace and potato crisps. NTA", "Oh dear god! The grown ass man needs to get over his childish thing about a bit of crispy potato. NTA.", "It's also chips, it's not the end of the damn world to go one meal without.", "I\u2019m not trying to dismiss his trauma or anything but\u2026 is your brother in law controlling in any other way?\n\nI\u2019ve heard of people doing this before. They feign an allergy or trauma just to control others into not doing something or eating something. They tend to be childish in other aspects of their personalities and are definitely the \u201cwe\u2019re going to do what I want\u201d type.\n\nEither way NTA because if it is real trauma he needs therapy.

It goes back to when I was 4/5 and forced to stay at the table for a very long time to eat an adult sized meal containing salmon. The smell makes me feel very I\u2019ll if it\u2019s in front of me. My husband loves salmon. I buy smoked salmon for him every couple of months. I don\u2019t like it so I don\u2019t eat it.

Next time, go on holiday without them all to a Walker's factory :D", "People do have wierd fears. I have an irrational fear of goldfish. Just goldfish. I'm ok with other fish.  I had a panic attack in Petsmart when I walked past a tank full of them. Dropped the bag of cat food and ran.  I don't begrudge others from having goldfish. And I do laugh about it. I kinda have to, until I see one. I do eat the occasional goldfish cracker.", "I\u2019m saddened by the idea that they went to spoons on holiday, compared to the myriad lovely local pubs one can find, but I suppose if they\u2019re all picky eaters, not just OP, chains do make it easier.", "Honestly, if they managed to fit four carloads of people on one table anyway, that sounds like a right pain in the arse for the staff (you just know they didn\u2019t put the tables back afterwards). They\u2019re TA just for that!"]}
