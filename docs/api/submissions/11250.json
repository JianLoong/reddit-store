Sounds like she can\u2019t take care of her son, a group home is a fine suggestion for both parties.", "NTA. Depending on the level of severity, taking care of an autistic adult can be a full time job. But PWS on top of that. \n\nI don't think a lot of people here understand the gravity of PWS. These are people who lack the part of the brain that controls hunger and reads the hormones that tell us that we are full. These people can literally eat themselves to death because they have nothing to shut off their hunger. It's not uncommon to have a pt eat out of the trash, eat pet food, even animal feces in severe cases. They will steal, beg, borrow, manipulate ANYTHING to get access to food. Imagine eating your way through a buffet and still feeling like you haven't eaten in days. \n\nPWS in itself isn't a deadly disorder however the bast majority of patients are morbidly obese and due to the poor muscle tone that comes with the disorder, theory caloric needs are actually far less than an average adult. \n\nPeople with PWS are CONSTANTLY fixated on food. It's not much different than a opioid addict. Unlike an opioid addict, however, you can't take a PW patient out of the situation. Food is literally one of the building blocks of our culture and it is something we need to survive. \n\nPW pts needs constant supervision, structure and routine. Without it, they will succumb to obesity related illness very quickly. To keep them safe in a home environment is like living in a prison. Kitchens have to be kept under lock and key...with many homes now outfitting the kitchen with ballistic proof doors, coded and biometric locks, and alarms. Additionally, the pantries, icebox, garbage cans, pet food also have to be kept locked as well as a backup. Mealtimes as a family are non existent because the patient will eat their food and begin to fixate on other people's plates. Doors and windows have to have alarms so they don't leave to seek food. Money, credit cards and valuables have to be kept locked up so they can't go buy food. \n\nDiet has to be constantly monitored. Food and beverages have to be weighed and measured. Tantrums are common and caregivers have been injured while trying to stop food seeking behavior. \n\nThis is FAR more complicated than a differently abled person who needs adult supervision. Hunger is a VERY primitive and instinctual feeling and the drive to satisfy hunger is very much primal in nature. Living with a PW patient can be VERY taxing and requires specialized family therapy. Most average adult babysitters are NOT equipped to handle them. \n\nThat is specifically WHY many PWS patients DO live in group homes or go to day care. \n\nI have a LOT of sympathy for the cousin. I really do. But she needs to understand that if it's hard enough on her, someone who has existed with this man's condition his entire life, that she is not doing him any favors by foisting him off on people who are ill equipped to manage his condition. \n\nWhat she is doing could be dangerous for both the u willing caregivers AND her son. I would consider calling the local agency that supervises the elderly and disabled. She clearly needs help but it can't come in the form of forcing unwilling and Ill equipped family and friends into a full time caregiving role.", "You could have just said \u201cno\u201d, and let her figure out the rest. However, day centers are not as bad as people make them out to be. Her son may appreciate spending time with literally anyone outside of his family. Day centers for the disabled are a great way for disabled people to have a chance to get out and interact.", "NTA. As a parent she needs to put her child\u2019s needs and well-being first. Not being babysat by people who neither want to or have the knowledge to do so. I wouldn\u2019t want that responsibility either. She sounds entitled whilst I imagine she\u2019s probably burnt out and wanting help, it\u2019s clear you aren\u2019t the one to do that", "NTA all the family complaining have just volunteered to watch him though :)", "NTA. \n\nShe's having trouble caring for him, which is completely understandable because of his condition. But she can't expect everyone else to drop everything for him, that's not your job.", "NTA you cant be expected to watch him all the time. 1 its not your job and 2 you have your own life. where you even being payed to baby sit this guy if not then there is most certainly a limit on what you are expected to do.", "NTA. Whoever is sending you angry messages can babysit Jason. Problem solved.", "NTA, it seems like you expressed that you are ill-equipped to care for this man, and thats what he is, hes an adult, and I imagine a rather large one if he has Prader Willi. You were honest that you do not have the capacity to give this man the care he needs, and I imagine you don't. Its not fair to him, and its not fair to you. You're right, he needs to socialize, and there are organizations out there, not as many as there should be that help adult people with these conditions and that sounds like what he needs. He needs interaction with more than just caregivers, he needs, peers.", "NTA\n\nAnything you did up to this point to help has been kind of you. You are by no means OBLIGATED nor trained to watch over an ADULT with special needs. The cousin has enjoyed the freedom and is probably pissed that she now has to find and then PAY for real care. You have been a \"Nice Guy\" up till now and just because you want to do something else doesn't make you suddenly NOT.\n\nIf the family gets on your ass I would just tell them they are more than welcome to offer the cousin to help out in your place but you have your own life and want you time for yourself or  whatever.\n\nI would encourage everyone that takes the time to have an opinion on this in your family, to instead get online and look into the programs in your area for exactly this. I know for a fact many major metro areas have them and many are FREE.", "The way you said it was wrong but you are right on telling her she needs to make arrangement for her son. A day program is a good way for him to socialize. I think you should tell the family what happen and apologize and let her know your overwhelmed and aren\u2019t equip to take care of him.", "NTA, your family are not experts in the care of severely autistic adults. Your cousin needs to start looking into these type of programs now as she isn't going to live forever.", "NTA - you are well within your rights to put a stop to the unreasonable unpaid demands on your time.  Neither you nor your mother owe this woman carer services for her son.  Maybe you could have phrased it a bit better, but the group home suggestion is actually a good one.  What does she plan to do some day when she's not able to care for him any more?  I'm sure she was planning to dump him on you or someone else in the family, but she needs to be more practical because it doesn't sound like that's going to fly far.  She needs a wake up call to do what's best for her son rather than just making him other people's issue.", "She really should arrange for some help that is outside the family.  Constantly asking family to care for an 18 year old with autism and Prader-Willi syndrome is a bit much.  She should not consider you her built in support system.\n\n\u2018Speaking your mind to someone who is obviously stressed due to  the situation usually causes problems.  Your comments about a group home and daycare were probably hard for her to hear.  But she absolutely cannot keep making this your problem as well as her own.  And she can\u2019t plan on having a night job and expecting you and the other family members to take care of him.  That\u2018s not reasonable.\n\nNTA, but try to be a bit gentler with your cousin.", "NTA, don\u2019t defend/stand up for your mother next time and simply say you don\u2019t have the time. Seems like everyone involved is taking advantage of your free time.", "Undecided - yes you have every right to say no to looking after her son. That\u2019s your choice and you don\u2019t have to do that. \nHowever, saying he should go to a group home or with other people like him was really not the way to go about it. Alternatively, you could have said \u201cunfortunately I no longer want to look after Jason as it is a lot for me and my mum. Is there any other alternatives you could do, maybe another babysitter or even places he can go during the day for a couple hours whilst you work.\u201d", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You might have been blunt but she needs to hear that everyone would understand if she took that step and she wouldn't be judged for it. The reality beyond the moment is that Jason is already eighteen and she's old enough to have an eighteen year old. By FAR the best outcomes for people going into group homes is to do it while their family is still able to be a part of the process. Right now Jason can start on a routine and get into a home and still come home for family events and celebrations. Right now there are people who are invested in his care and who can make sure that he is being cared for properly.

What I can tell you from experience is that families have to participate in the process and bear some of the burden for preparing to have students who are legally adults.  Even things like making sure they have guardianship in place before their child turns 18 or they have started the paperwork to access government services early enough to avoid gaps, since the process often takes years, are things you can talk about as a case manager, but you can't make families do anything.  To be perfectly honest, once a student qualifies for special education and a parent signs the initial paperwork consenting to services, you could potentially not see those parents again all the way through to the end of high school and there's not much you can do.", "In my state, that level of special needs students are able to stay in public school for free until 21.", "I'm an obese person myself, around a US size 18-20.

I had a nine year old hide a sharpened pencil in his sleeve to stab me in my belly when I was seven months pregnant because we stopped him from throwing books at other kids.
