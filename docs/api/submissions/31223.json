Get her a magnetic nose ring for the holidays. No piercing. No scarring. No commitment.", "NTA.  No phone for a weekend is a reasonable consequence for such a big lie like that.  What she did wasn't even safe, and she's lucky it didn't end up infected.  Show her some pictures to show her what could have happened and how serious it was.", "NTA. Aside from the fact that you already had set that boundary and she broke it and lied, but removing it was the right decision health wise. You should never attempt to pierce your own nose, especially as a 14 year old with no access to proper piercing tools. Her keeping that piercing in could have led to infection and bad keloids.", "NTA LOL, I do not miss those days but 14 year olds are not known for critical thinking when they want what they want. I'll pierce my nose and Mom will never notice. Taking the piercing out and no phone for two days is hardly the end of the world. Everyone I knew who got nose piercings at university got rid of them because in a lot of professional settings nose piercings like face tattoos are job killers.", "NTA. Educate her on why doing a piercing herself is so unsafe.", "NTA. You set boundaries. She broke the rules and lied.", "NTA, woo boy I remember doing a DIY lip piercing this way at the same age. My mom handled it much worse but in retrospect I'm so glad she did.\n\nI really like the idea suggested by someone else of a magnetic nose ring as a gift for Christmas.", "NTA. YWBTA, if you didn't have her, face the consequences, especially for lying. I believe one of the reasons we have so many entitled individuals is due to parents who were too lax. I have a 22-year-old.  He is a good person, but I regret not being more firm with him. He\u2019s struggling, and I know that I am partially to blame for that.", "Strict parents make sneaky kids , my friend in high school pierced her own belly button and nearby died of infection , it\u2019s. Nose piercing not a nipple piercing kids will be kids And do things regardless chances are if she has been allowed to keep it in she would have grew bored of it easily", "YTA - you really should be talking things through with your daughter and supporting her.
