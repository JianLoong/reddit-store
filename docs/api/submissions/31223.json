I would take your daughter to a professional piercer if she did the piercing herself, just to have them make sure she didn\u2019t accidentally pierce something that could seriously hurt her down the line.

Make sure she keeps it clean while it\u2019s closing, because it\u2019s always possible for an infection to happen. I would also have a sit down with her and talk to her (calmly) about why she can\u2019t have a piercing right now, and why it was dangerous for her to get one the way she did. I would also recommend, if she still really wants a piercing (which she clearly does) talking about steps she can take to earn one.

A lot of kids don't understand the risks and end up with lifelong scarring, nerve damage, or other complications. \n\nIf she did have it done by someone who claims to be a professional, then go to them and let them know they pierced a minor without adult consent.

I did the exact same thing at her age, except it was stretching my ears and telling my mom they were fake. She was furious when she found out but I could never understand why she cared, they\u2019re my ears after all and I made sure to do soo much research before hand. I understand more now at 25, but I\u2019m still of the position that if she wants it that bad, just let her do it. At her age, I just decided to do a better job at hiding my piercings and stuff from my mom. I did my septum because I could flip it up, I did my smiley because that was always hidden, etc. My mom eventually caved after realizing this was really important to me and just started taking me to professionals so I wouldn\u2019t harm myself.

It's even harder without a partner to bounce things off.  But how much does it matter to you?  I say this as someone whose child pierced their own bellybutton at 13.  With a DIY amazon kit.  Did it make me cringe every time I saw it?  Did I worry about what other parents would think of her (and us, her parents)? Yes, yes, yes.  But in the end we decided that as far as self-expression goes, it is not permanent, not vaping, not sexual experimentation, not drugs, etc.  So we did talk about what other parents and adults might think but she is a good kid so we let her keep it.

I cannot fathom why it is better to risk the inhalation of a magnet over a cleanly and professionally pierced, small nose stud, yes even at fourteen years old.. Prohibit things like this and kids take it into their own and, well, do it themselves.

There\u2019s no rational reason for her to not have a nose piercing. This is about you controlling her appearance, and your fears of being judged as a parent. The nose piercing is harmless, and unless you foresee her having a lucrative career as a nose model, won\u2019t negatively impact her life in any way. I\u2019m willing to bet you let her get her ears pierced already, because that\u2019s more culturally acceptable. \n\nThere will be more important hills to die on.

I don't know how it is in other countries, but since it's more cultural in my country I guess it's accepted more.\nOther than piercing it herself I don't see why her getting her nose pierced is an issue.

Let her have some bodily autonomy.", "NTA \n\nI have 8 piercings currently, planning at least 5 more in my dreams lol so I do have some knowledge. \n\nPiercing is serious business and she needs to treat it as such. She could've gotten sick with an infection, especially if she was putting patches over it and disturbing it, not to mention irritation bumps etc. 14 imo is just too young to be doing facial piercings. I understand her perspective, it sucks to wait for what you want especially when you're so young and have so few years of experience with waiting. By bypassing the waiting and doing something dangerous like that she just showed she isn't mature enough to be making these kinds of decisions.

Piercing something your self with zero experience is not a good idea. Did she use a piercing needle? Did she know how to properly take care of it? This is something that a professional needs to do because you also need to be aware of where nerves are so you don\u2019t accidentally hit them and cause permanent damage. I know when I got my tongue pierced years ago the piercer had an apprentice and was explaining how you can\u2019t go straight into the center. You have to go off centre slightly because there is a nerve that you can damage that goes through the centre of the tongue.

What tools did she use , how did she sanitise is , how was she cleaning it . Pimple patches will not help ! The risk of infection is high in that area if not cared for properly and that can lead to pain and deformities and even worse ! \n\nIt was a very silly thing to do and you were right to give appropriate punishment to your daughter . \n\nYour actually being super reasonable by saying to her in the first place that you\u2019ll discuss things when she\u2019s 16 .

The fact she performed the piercing herself tells me she\u2019s not mature enough to be engaging with body modification; self-piercing is not ever the correct course of action. Many will disagree, but unless you have been trained by a professional piercer over years, a dedicated piercing room in your home and an autoclave, you cannot guarantee safe procedure piercing yourself at home. Even most professional piercers won\u2019t pierce themselves, they\u2019ll visit another trusted professional.\n\nETA: I saw she\u2019s been interested in a septum piercing; there are professional piercers out there who can\u2019t get these right and should never ever attempt such a thing by herself, especially not for something like a septum that requires very specific placement and technique.

She's just being 14. I know I was not pleasant as a teen, either, and that's okay.\n\nListen, I'm a goth, I saw my fair share of DIY piercings (and tattoos), those can go wrong, and I personally think 14 is too young for body modification. You gave a fair compromise, revisiting this when she's more mature, unfortunately her teen brain is still stuck on \"instant gratification\" mode, which yeah that's normal, and she did something stupid behind your back.\n\nTaking it out and losing phone privileges for the weekend is honestly a minimal punishment for this. Of course she thinks you're an asshole, but welcome to being the parent of a teen - you're gonna be the asshole in her eyes for a while. Hang in there, and just make sure that despite everything, she has a safe space in you.", "YTA. If the nose piercing is the worst thing she\u2019s done, then you\u2019re acting stupid.

My mother tried to protest but guess what, I was 18. She couldn\u2019t say jack shit. Do you want your daughter to have an attitude towards you?", "NTA. I have a nose piercing and from experience it does heal very fast without scarring, so don't worry too much about that, especially if it was made with a needle. I also wanted a nose piercing since I was about 12, but my parents didn't let me until I was 18, despite being the most chill parents ever. I ended up getting it when I was 18 and at 26 I still don't regret it, but I'm grateful to my parents for not letting me get it sooner. Compromise with your daughter by getting her a magneric ring as a gift.", "NTA, but I guess I never understand dieing on hills like this. It's a small nose ring and nobody is losing their life.

Much better she learns now! I think you handled it perfectly.", "Nta\nI think you handled it well. She deserves to be grounded for the deception. And I wouldn't let her get a fake one for a while just to drive the point home. But, as for letting her keep the piercing...I think she is too young to make this decision now. While nose piercings are becoming more and more popular, there is still a little stigmatization to them.", "With all due respect, just let her get it done at a proper piercing shop. If you set limits like this (aka arbitrary limits just for the sake of having a limit) she will push them. My mom wouldn\u2019t let me get a nose piercing, so when I had a friend who could drive, we went to a piercing shop asap. Taking her to get it done safely and making her pay for the service herself is a much better compromise. When your kid wants something entirely harmless badly enough to poke holes in their own skin, maybe it\u2019s time to examine WHY you\u2019re saying no to it? Setting this limit has ended up putting her in more danger than just taking her to get it done. \n\nNose piercings are tiny. I take mine out and there\u2019s almost no mark. She will not be permanently scarred by it, this isn\u2019t like a tattoo, and it\u2019s not really considered trashy in our modern society anymore either. I would pick your battles. If she hates it, she can take it out later.\n\nSo yeah YTA for being a parent who denies her kid something reasonable to the point where she resorted to hurting herself.", "NTA -  Your daughter did something dangerous and hid it from you.   Something could have gone very wrong here.   What would she have done if there was an infection?  Would she have continued to hide it until it became severe?\n\nPiercings are cool, but they need to be done by professionals and they need to be properly cared for.", "You are definitely not the asshole, that kid probably would have an infection worse then Claries, no doubt she probably found a leftover earning and stapled it to her nose\ud83d\udc80", "NTA. Honestly, taking it out was the consequence of doing it to herself when she knew she wasn\u2019t supposed to. Two days without her phone is the consequence of hiding it from you for weeks.

She\u2019s lucky she didn\u2019t get an infection! She\u2019ll be upset with you for awhile, but when she\u2019s my age she\u2019ll get it.

I've never been big on piercing, but I know plenty of people who did the same thing with the old safety pin piercing, only to have it immediately removed by a parent and heal over, and they all got over it, grew up, and got piercings safely from a professional when they were older and better able to educate themselves on the risks.", "NTA", "NTA- I came home with an eyebrow piercing when I was 18, I got all the shit in the world for it from my parents but it was my choice.\n\nI wanted it since I was 13, but knew what the reaction would be.\n\nAnd to prove my parent aren't tight asses, I got a tattoo when I was 16, it was their Christmas present to us.\n\nIt's about knowing, safety, and avoiding peer pressure, explain that to her, you just want her to be safe at all times.", "NTA. You can seriously damage yourself doing at home piercings. However, this is a good reason why it probably wouldn't have been a bad idea to take her to a shop and get it done safely and by a professional before she went stabbing needles through her face.

I love them all and have never regretted getting them. \n\nI don't think you should take her any time soon and I do think she deserves to be punished for doing it herself and lying about/hiding it from you.

I removed the piercing and cleaned then they went on their way but a few months later they came back in to tell me that their daughter (the girl with the DIY lip piercing) was tested positive for HIV. It wasn't clear if it was from the dirty needle, but she did infect the other kids with it, too. You should never do DIY piercings!", "YTA because:\n\n- a piercing done professionally isn't a big thing. You didn't listen to her. She is lucky she didn't get her DIY piercing infected. \n\n- you made her take it out, after it was already in there, presumably without seeking any professional advice about future repiercing of it. \n\n- you put her in a position where she couldn't be honest with you and you punished her for it.\n\n- you don't seem to know your daughter well enough to know how determined she is to get what she wants. \n\nYou could have framed this as a lesson on determination, infections and the importance of a transparent and honest relationship. It could actually have strengthened the relationship between you and your daughter - but instead you made her take it out, not knowing if it can be repierced there again and made her feel like she is under your control for your own satisfaction.", "YTA", "Dude it's her body, if she wants a piercing badly enough to poke a hole in her face herself, she's going to be doing it anyway soon enough so you should probably just tell her she needs to save the money up to have it done safely. YTA. I get not thinking she's old enough to make that choice but she literally just did make the choice in a less safe way because you won't let her make the choice safely.", "YTA, she's 14, nose piecings are harmless. She lied and hid it from you because you were not open with her, or supportive of something she wanted. You said wait until 16 to discuss it again. Aka wait 2 more years to tell her no again right? When she grows up she will likely do more things without asking your opinion.\n\nSource, I am a guy. My mom said I could not piece my ears when I was in highschool. So I had my friend do it for me. Now I'm 26, successful engineer, making 100k, have my piercings still, have a lip piercing and have not regretted any piercings.\n\n\nFiance is also an engineer, has belly and nose piercings. No point not letting her get it. The hole is not noticeable either if she ever takes it off.", "I'm almost 40, but was a 14 year old who wanted a nose piercing. \n\nI spent time discussing it with my mother and she agreed that if I really wanted it and understood the implications of getting it, she would take me somewhere safe to get it done.\n\nI still have the nose piercing, and while she didn't like it, she supported my desire to be an individual. \n\nYour daughter did this herself because of lack of support and respect for her growing individuality. If you lose the place every time she wants to explore boundaries, you'll create a sneaky kid and a young adult who is not as close to you. \n\nI don't know what you thought would happen as a result of a nose piercing, but it's really not a big deal. It sounds like she had to take the route less desired because of your attitude.\n\nI see why you did it because self piercing isn't safe, but she shouldn't have had to.\n\nYTA.", "NTA But I'd be shocked if she managed to do it herself. It bloody hurts and the nostril is a thick bit of cartilage. To do it to yourself with a sewing needle or similar is horrifying. It was bad enough when I had it done at a proper, decent piercer with a proper needle and numbing spray. If there's a piercer piercing 14 year olds in your area, you should be worried. What else don't they care about if they don't care about piercing unaccompanied minors?\n\nFunny story... I got mine 1st semester of uni and told my mum over the phone. She told my dad and he thought it was a septum ring, which she let him think for weeks till I came home for Christmas. When he saw a tiny silver stud in my nostril, set with an even tinier purple crystal, he was so relieved I didn't have \"a giant bull ring\" as he put it, he never mentioned it again. And I'm still wearing a nostril stud 25 years later. In fact, this is probably about my 25th anniversary of my first \"proper\" piercing.\n\nI followed it up the next year by going home with a tongue stud he didn't even notice for a month until he was sitting opposite me on the train to go back to uni in February. Even he admitted he couldn't complain about that. Good times!", "NTA. It's not what I would do (I have a nose piercing and I got my belly button pierced behind my mom's back at 16, and I love both) but she's not my kid, is she? Nothing about your response was disproportionate or abusive, or even all that harsh. She'll be fine.", "NTA, I got mine when I was 14 because my mom allowed me.

My mom always said to give it another year to see if I still want it, and she was damn right each time cause I absolutely did not. \n\n16 is a perfectly reasonable age for this to be up for discussion again, and if she still really wants it by then, I would personally let her get it.", "NTA but I'm in favor of punishments that better fit the \"crime.\" Her big offense was lying, right? So what's a punishment for lying? Something about trust? Maybe a loss of privileges for awhile? \n\nI'd be nervous about the magnetic nose ring. What if she inhales it? And why let her have one if you're against nose rings? I think that sends a confusing message. \nI don't think she'll be making more mature decisions about marking her body at 16 than at 14, so why make her wait? Is it just because you said so? \n\nThis feels like one of those fashion choices that is best ignored. But I wouldn't ignore the lying.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not the piercing that\u2019s the issue for me (I started young) but it\u2019s that you have an agreement/rule on when this will happen.

And then she had the gall to just let it stand as if because it\u2019s done she\u2019s gotten her way.

As someone who did the self piercing thing a LOT as a teenager and hid it extremely well from my parents (I had a tongue piercing for years and they never even knew) it can be dangerous if it\u2019s done incorrectly, and if she\u2019s that adamant about it then more communication needs to be done. I don\u2019t regret the piercings I have currently, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d like having a tongue piercing anymore as I find them a bit tacky and I\u2019m glad that I ended up having to take it out for a hospital stay and it closed up \ud83d\udc80\n\nI\u2019d talk to her very seriously about the risks involved with doing this herself, the infections she can get, the scars she will have if she changes her mind later.

I would keep the piercing out in front of my parents and as soon as I was in my room/at school/anywhere where my parents weren\u2019t I would put it back in. I would imagine it increases infection risk to keep putting it in and out without proper cleaning. I was persistent and didn\u2019t let the hole close up.

Your kid is the AH. I would know, considering I did the same thing to my mom at her age.

Seems like reasonable punishment for something that could have had potentially dangerous medical consequences if it were to become infected.", "To be a young teen, lmao. I pierced my own ears at that age and my mom was furious with me for not going to a professional shop. She then took me to get them fixed. My holes are still wonky because I did it myself and it couldn\u2019t be fixed. That is a lesson that\u2019s stayed with me, and one I want to share with you. \n\nNAH- teens are stupid and you\u2019re mad she lied. Coming from a teacher of 12 year olds, this could turn into a wonderful bonding experience for you both. To her, it might seem like you\u2019re trumping on her body autonomy (teen mind, again). \n\nIf I could make a recommendation: explain why that was dangerous, why you\u2019re angry she lied (because that\u2019s the biggest issue!), and then go to a legitimate piercing shop to get it fixed but at the cost of her still losing phone privileges for longer than a week. Then, make a deal that she has to wait until 16. \n\nThis is one of those sucky instances where she is learning whether she can get away with something/trust you. She\u2019s going to do piercings either way; you are just determining if you will be privy to that information or if she will come up with a better way to lie. It\u2019s up to you, as her parent, to show her clear consequences that will also instill some trust. She made a *stupid, impulsive teen decision*- one that she would be likely to make again. You clearly love her and want the best for her. I truly think you can make this into a bonding experience she learns from rather than resents.", "NTAH!", "NTA.  You had discussed it and had a plan to do the piercing in two years.

She didn't find out for a little, but when she did, I was in a lot of trouble and had to take it out of course. And honestly, even then, even though I wasn't happy about it I knew that I had it coming. I wasn't happy to not have my phone for several weeks and wasn't happy I had to take it out, but I knew the risk of going behind her back which is why I hid it in the first place. \n\n\nShe's mad now, but she'll get over it. You're a lot more lenient than my mother was considering even now with me being 26 she begs me not to get my septum pierced, so she definitely never entertained the idea of a nostril piercing as a teenager. She's just a teen, She's angsty and thought she could get away with it long enough to where you'd just accept it and think \"well it's already there and basically healed, might as well leave it\" and is upset that her plan backfired. No biggie, you aren't being too harsh or a bad mom, actions have consequences and lying is of those things that will definitely warrant them. Lesson learned for her", "NTA.

In the end, DIY piercings are really dangerous, and I'm glad she didn't get an infection (though I say you should keep an eye on it while it heals, she still has a chance for infection). I can't talk much about her age, when I got my own nose pierced at 14.... but I got mine done at an actual tattoo parlor. \nIf she does want a piercing that bad, I'd recommend a septum (done by a professional). They're easy to hide, and if she wants to take it out, the scar will be hidden anyways. It's a great starter piercing, as much as people hate them. Also, along with other comments, magnetic piercings are a good idea too.", "NTA\n\nPunishment fits the crime. If she did it herself then she risks infection. Best to remove the piercing permanently until you can get a professional piercing done. They always complain about you taking their phone away because that's what they value the most.

Or maybe even set up to get the piercing at 15? 2 years is forever for a teenager and it wouldn't have hurt you to compromise on a year.", "Ohhhh I can speak to this one. As a parent, NTA because you set rules and she didn't follow them.\n\nHowever, know that this isn't a hill you want to die on though. As an adult 14 seems so young! But when you're 14 you don't feel young and a nose piercing is such a tame, non permanent way to self express. If she's passionate to the point where she'll pierce her own nose..  she's passionate to the point that she'll skip class to get the tattoo, or piercings that are easier to hide or- she just won't go to a professional and do it herself. Saying this as the 14yr old who DID dye my hair purple in secret, pierced my own ears, skipped class for the eyebrow ring, navel and nipple.. pierced my own lip with snake bites and kept taking them out when I got home (with zero regard to the healing process. I lied about my age for all of it, including my tattoo. And 100% went with easier to hide piercings. It was a HUGE point of contention but at 14 I was ride or die on the my body my choice idea and nobody was going to tell me that a nose ring was somehow going to inherently turn me onto a bad person.\n\nIMO, you need to reevaluate your strategy here. Your kid likely won't take this and think \"yeah, for sure I'll wait until I'm 16 when mom might let me get a tiny stud\". She'll take this experience and learn to hide things better.", "Why not let her have a nose ring?  It's her body you seem way over conserned.

I'm 43 and still wear a stud in the piercing I gave myself at 14. My mom made me pierce hers lol. I had a fucked up childhood. I mean you waited and didn't even embarrass her at school. You were respectful. You allowed her to express her feelings to you after. \n\nShe'll be upset but she'll get over it. You did the right thing by her", "No, NTA.   \n\n\nYour daughter got caught in a lie. And I'll be honest, in doing something that could potentially be unsafe. That doesn't sound like the case here, so the focus is on the lie and on trying to evade household rules. Punishment should discomfit her, but also should be scaleable to what she did. In this case removal of the piercing and loss of her phone for a few days is a MILD response. I hope that you have made it clear that this kind of sneakiness and lies will generate more serious punishment and loss of privileges next time. She is a teen and has to realize that actions have consequences.  \n\n\nThankfully piercings can fade. But other body-mods may not heal as easily. Hair color changes are usually transitory, but tattoos are basically forever. So setting 16 as a target to talk about piercings is a reasonable response. Since this has come up, it's probably a good idea to go over other body mods, tattoos, etc. Setting a time period to talk about them is a good way to allow her to make decisions over time.", "My kid was obsessed with a nose piercing at the end of 8th grade.

She wouldn't lie if you hadn't kept her from making completely innocuous ascetic decisions.", "If she's allowed ear piercings but not a nose stud, then you're the asshole. There's a slightly higher risk of infection with a nose piercing, but other than that a nose stud is no different than an earring in terms of self-expression. One is just more culturally acceptable than the other. \n\n\nSo if she's allowed ear piercings, then your refusal to allow the nose stud and her punishment for it are inappropriate and you should apologize.", "At 14 I had a face full of piercings. Now that I\u2019m in my 20s I have none. The ose was the only piercing that didn\u2019t leave a scar for me.

Either way, I personally would be a bit more strict with it, but I\u2019m sure everyone says that then ends up softening when they see how badly their kid wants something. I understand completely making her take the piercing out, but I just don\u2019t know what her phone has to do with it. I understand it\u2019s just a form of punishment, but her phone had nothing to do with what she did wrong so why is that the punishment? Is that the only control you have over her is the phone? I don\u2019t think you took it too far but I\u2019m just wondering why the phone.", "Nta", "Nta.

The lying and fact that she did it herself is not the issue, you just didn't give her any other choice. Not that she absolutely needed to get it done, but it's not like you gave her the option to go to a professional piercer. She was clearly committed to getting it done and the pimple patch thing just goes to show how afraid she was of you finding out, which is sad. You proved her right by making her take it out- I agree with her that it was punishment enough. Now she has to go to school and be humiliated by having people notice that she had a nose piercing for a very short period of time. Girls at that age are extremely self-conscious and this was something that could have boosted her self esteem- you took that away from her and then took away her phone too? Also, septum rings are extremely easy to hide- when I was her age every girl had one and would just flip it upwards. I think she chose the nostril because she's smart, and knew it would be easier/safer to do herself.", "NTA, but honestly a nose ring is really not a big deal, and wanting to do something aesthetically to your own body that your parents don\u2019t approve of is a pretty standard right of passage. \n\nIt is her body and her autonomy and she\u2019s at the age where forming her own identity and sense of self expression is a pivotal part of growing up.

Authoritarian parenting doesn't usually work so great with teenagers (amhik) and is shitty anyway. You \"thought you agreed\" about waiting until she was 16. She did not agree, clearly.

I don't think your punishment was extreme at all, I think the problem started before that.\n\nINFO: does your daughter have pierced ears?", "NTA, she broke the agreement and tried to hide it, expecting you to just get over it once it was healed. That \"talk it over at 16\" may need to be reassessed.\n\nBut I'm curious -- if you're not conservative, why did you let her have the nose piercing before 16? Most people have ear piercings well before 14.
