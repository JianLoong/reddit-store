Sure it sounds weird but I don\u2019t make art of people or characters. I use my OCs. My parents don\u2019t mind it either and I still live with them because they don\u2019t want me to move out. I have my own private studio in the basement and since I\u2019m the only one who uses that room a lot, I print out sketches or make sketches of the body and poses and hang them up on the corkboard. I also leave the finalized art on my desk and many other merch that contain NSFW.\n\nYesterday, my mother\u2019s friend (M)  came over with her two kids, a 13 (A)  and 10 years old boy (E). A is very quiet and well behaved but E on the hand is very misbehaving and curious. I understand that kids are very curious at that age but he does not have any boundaries. At the time of the visit, I was making a new drawing and printed out the sketch to figure out what I can change and stuff (it\u2019s my habit). I leave them on the corkboard. The basement is quite hidden so when I left to get water, I left it a little bit unopened. M and my mom were talking and A was just sitting but E was walking around the house. It only took me a few seconds to go get the water but when I went back to my studio, I saw E looking around shocked and on the verge of tears. I also put a do not enter sign on the studio door but he still went in anyways.\n\nI frantically ran over and dragged him out but it was too late cause he already saw the pictures. He started crying for some reason and M and my mom came over. My mom already knew what was going on because she knew where the sound was coming from. M came over and yelled at me \u201cDid you hurt my child?! What did my child do to you? You better apologize and explain the situation!\u201d But before I can even explain, she looked over my shoulder and saw my studio and the pictures. And let me tell you, she went tomato red.\n\nShe yelled again \u201cOMG! Were you showing my child these pictures!?\u201d And I said no and how he went in by himself and my mom tried to explain too but she looked at me disgusted and left the house.\n\nToday, she came again with her husband to discuss compensation for traumatizing him and advising my parents how I should find a real job.\n\nI thought about the situation again and I feel like I was at fault. I know children can be curious so no matter how hard I try to warn them, they will feel the need to go in. And I think I shouldn\u2019t hang the pictures or leave the door open in the first place.

It's clear that you take precautions to keep your art separate from shared spaces in the house.\r  \n\r  \nM's reaction seems exaggerated and unfair. You didn't show the child the pictures; he discovered them on his own. It's understandable that you and your mom tried to explain the situation, but M's immediate judgment and assumption of wrongdoing without listening to your side of the story is unwarranted. Furthermore, her demand for compensation and suggestion that you find a \"real job\" are uncalled for and disrespectful.\r  \n\r  \nMoving forward, it might be a good idea to take additional measures to secure your studio and prevent accidental encounters. Consider keeping the door locked or installing a keypad lock to ensure that only you have access. However, remember that you have the right to pursue your chosen career and create the art you love.

No amount of excuses can justify that \"job\" to me.", "Esh you *considerably* less than the mom though. \n\nWith kids over, I'd say it's unreasonable to leave a room full of nsfw art unlocked. Just like I lock the liquor cabinet when teens come over and put expensive jewelry away when there's company. Because I know any situation in my home starts with me. I'm in complete control of what provides temptation in my home. Because a shitty kid is going to be a shitty kid.\n\nBut she's the one letting her son snoop through someone else's house.

Expecting op to keep their own room under lock and key and locking it every time they need to get some water is NOT reasonable.", "I already ordered more locks (i already have one) but I left the door open because I thought no one was visiting.", "They make ocs (original characters) not pictures of themselves, and dragged him out probably means just that dragged him out kids have this thing of going limp when they know or think their gonna be in trouble while being picked up or carried to their mom or dad so you gotta drag them which can be done safely its just slightly funny to watch", "I didn\u2019t know they were visiting because my studio is sound proof and only realized later on but I will definitely tighten up the security.", "Do you lock everything sharp away when you go to bed? I would hate for a home invader to cut themselves in your house and a load of people to tell you that you suck because of it.", "There's no negligence on OP's part because the child isn't OP's responsibility.", "No need to.  The fact that it's in an isolated part of the house and there's and a sign are more than enough.  This woman needs to teach her kid not to go wandering around someone else's home.  .", "If it gets you paid it's a job you judgemental ah", "Nobody cares about your views, just the situation", "So you think South Park and Walking Dead are ok but not nudity?  Pot meet kettle\u2026\n\nOP is NTA", "She didn\u2019t realize people were over because it is a soundproof studio", "OP and mom need compensation from M for not controlling her kid in someone else's space and not teaching him manners when in someone else's home. Doesn't matter how many times we go see friends or family and feel familiar with the home, my kids know to ask before wandering away (if we're gathered outside they ask to go in, if inside they ask to go upstairs or whatever). You never know what's going on in someone's home between visits where a space is ok for visitors today but many not later.", "From the context, but the distinct lack of description of what the pictures actually were, they clearly go beyond 'nudity.'  I'd say either graphic sexual acts, massive gore, or possibly both.", "I'm that 1 person who walked in lol", "I do not think you should feel guilty for the unreasonable behaviour of this child and their mother.\n\nPresent them with the receipts for the locks and fitting time and tell her it is the price for keeping her wandering child safe in other people's homes.", "It seems like an awful lot to ask that you hide your art from unexpected children that you don\u2019t know are in your house! Absolutely NTA", "i get it ... its a failure in sense but all failures are lessons. learn from it. don't make that assumption moving forward or something like that. You will figure it out as you seem to understand.", ">I would hate for a home invader to cut themselves in your house and a load of people to tell you that you suck because of it.\n\nAnd yet, the law would find you liable. It is the same principle here.\n\nAs I mention to others, if there was a buzzsaw in the home, and it was left unsecured, and the child injured himself on it, then the OP and her mother would bear some substantial responsibility, because they knew there was a child.", "If the child had wandered into a room with a buzzsaw, and got injured on it from the same actions, then yes, the OP, and certainly her mother as the homeowner, would bear some responsibility. This is a similar situation. There was a hazardous object that was unsecured. The OP knew children were visiting who would likely wander unsupervised. Don't have children in your house if there are dangerous objects you are not willing to secure.", "I disagree that the OP is not responsible. If the OP had, say a buzzsaw in the home, failed to lock it while not in it, and the child wandered and injured himself, there would be no question she bears responsibility. This is the same situation: she had hazardous material in her home. She is responsible for securing it from harming others at all times. I agree with you that the mother of the child is more responsible.", "Then why does she bring up not closing the door because the room is hidden?", "So? The pictures were still in a private room away from areas where guests should be. The kid shouldn\u2019t have seen them but it\u2019s not OPs fault he did.", "And?", "So was I, except I opened my cousins safe and found his gun and decided to give it to him.  I can still hear the beating (Lmao). Kids are intelligent and nifty and find ways to open what's supposed to be sealed.", "It\u2019s just another way to say that the kid was going out of the way to get there", "Sure, but depending on the actual content of the pictures, I may or may not say that OP has an extra duty to keep them locked away from kids.\n\nLike, kids should stay out of cupboards, but you still need to take extra precautions with the dangerous chemicals or medicines.", "That doesn't make sense though. Either she's implying she feels/knows she should lock the door regardless of who is in the house, or the narrative is being changed. It's also confusing that she's talking about getting MORE locks when the whole issue is that she didn't bother using the one she had.", "Before having kids I wouldn\u2019t have made sure chemicals or medications were secure. It\u2019s not OPs kid. OP didn\u2019t know there were guests and nipped up for a glass of water. The kids mother is responsible here, not OP.", "Strong disagree. The kid does not live there.", "She is talking about getting more locks because she feels bad and the mom is asking for financial compensation"]}
