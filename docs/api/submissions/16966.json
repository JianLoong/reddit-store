Sure it sounds weird but I don\u2019t make art of people or characters. I use my OCs. My parents don\u2019t mind it either and I still live with them because they don\u2019t want me to move out. I have my own private studio in the basement and since I\u2019m the only one who uses that room a lot, I print out sketches or make sketches of the body and poses and hang them up on the corkboard. I also leave the finalized art on my desk and many other merch that contain NSFW.\n\nYesterday, my mother\u2019s friend (M)  came over with her two kids, a 13 (A)  and 10 years old boy (E). A is very quiet and well behaved but E on the hand is very misbehaving and curious. I understand that kids are very curious at that age but he does not have any boundaries. At the time of the visit, I was making a new drawing and printed out the sketch to figure out what I can change and stuff (it\u2019s my habit). I leave them on the corkboard. The basement is quite hidden so when I left to get water, I left it a little bit unopened. M and my mom were talking and A was just sitting but E was walking around the house. It only took me a few seconds to go get the water but when I went back to my studio, I saw E looking around shocked and on the verge of tears. I also put a do not enter sign on the studio door but he still went in anyways.\n\nI frantically ran over and dragged him out but it was too late cause he already saw the pictures. He started crying for some reason and M and my mom came over. My mom already knew what was going on because she knew where the sound was coming from. M came over and yelled at me \u201cDid you hurt my child?! What did my child do to you? You better apologize and explain the situation!\u201d But before I can even explain, she looked over my shoulder and saw my studio and the pictures. And let me tell you, she went tomato red.\n\nShe yelled again \u201cOMG! Were you showing my child these pictures!?\u201d And I said no and how he went in by himself and my mom tried to explain too but she looked at me disgusted and left the house.\n\nToday, she came again with her husband to discuss compensation for traumatizing him and advising my parents how I should find a real job.\n\nI thought about the situation again and I feel like I was at fault. I know children can be curious so no matter how hard I try to warn them, they will feel the need to go in. And I think I shouldn\u2019t hang the pictures or leave the door open in the first place.

It's unfortunate that E went into your studio without permission and saw your artwork, but you are not at fault for his actions.

It's clear that you take precautions to keep your art separate from shared spaces in the house.\r  \n\r  \nM's reaction seems exaggerated and unfair. You didn't show the child the pictures; he discovered them on his own. It's understandable that you and your mom tried to explain the situation, but M's immediate judgment and assumption of wrongdoing without listening to your side of the story is unwarranted. Furthermore, her demand for compensation and suggestion that you find a \"real job\" are uncalled for and disrespectful.\r  \n\r  \nMoving forward, it might be a good idea to take additional measures to secure your studio and prevent accidental encounters. Consider keeping the door locked or installing a keypad lock to ensure that only you have access. However, remember that you have the right to pursue your chosen career and create the art you love.

There is nothing wrong with kids learning about the human body and sex. Further, there is nothing wrong with kids seeing it when it is part of artwork.

Did you leave marks?\n\nI have serious doubts about your story. \n\nSomeone who makes NSFW art of themselves gives off major narcissist vibes, and your story just seems too far-fetched for you to be completely innocent.

No amount of excuses can justify that \"job\" to me.", "Esh you *considerably* less than the mom though. \n\nWith kids over, I'd say it's unreasonable to leave a room full of nsfw art unlocked. Just like I lock the liquor cabinet when teens come over and put expensive jewelry away when there's company. Because I know any situation in my home starts with me. I'm in complete control of what provides temptation in my home. Because a shitty kid is going to be a shitty kid.\n\nBut she's the one letting her son snoop through someone else's house.

Having a private collection or display is not against the law, but it is on the homeowner to ensure that it is secured so that a minor isn\u2019t exposed.

OP can argue it was an accident or done out of ignorance, but you\u2019re at the mercy of the court at that point and they tend to rule in favor of the minor. \n\nThe comparison with a dangerous tool is good one, because the law tries to determine if you took reasonable care to prevent the child from having access.
