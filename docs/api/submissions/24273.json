My mom and I were on vacation so we didn\u2019t have time to meet but he came by today. He apologised for being gone for so long and said he\u2019d love to catch up. My mom left us alone so we could talk just the two of us.\n\nIt was great, he asked me how I was doing in school and what I was doing in my freetime. He also told me a lot of stories about him and my mom and from when I was younger. \n\nHe then asked if I had plans for the next longer weekend. I said no so he asked me if I wanted to come on a trip with him. He said his girlfriend and her kids were coming too and they were excited to finally meet me.\n\nI kind of lost it at that. I told him he was a shitty father and an idiot if he expected me to want that. He looked hurt by what I said and tried to calm me down but I just wanted to let everything out. I yelled at him that he couldn\u2019t even bother to call on my birthdays and now he shows up and tells me he already has a new family and that I don\u2019t want to be a part of that. I eventually started crying and my mom told him to leave.\n\nI got a text from him apologising for how our meeting went and asking if I could give him another chance. He said he wants to do something just us, if I don\u2019t want to meet his family yet. I don\u2019t want to do that either though.

From the sound of it, this person doesn\u2019t deserve to be in your life. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I do believe in forgiveness and repairing relationships, but this guy needs to do more to prove he\u2019s someone you can trust and rely on.", "NTA. He thought he could just pick up where he left off. Truth is, he broke the relationship, he will have to wait until you're ready to be allowed to fix it. This will take a lot of time.\n\nYou are entitled to your feelings, don't worry too much about what he feels, he's an adult and he's the one who left.\n\nIs there any chance of you getting into counseling? It might be very helpful in sorting out your emotions as they relate to your father.\n\nI wish you well and I'm sorry for the situation you find yourself in. You didn't ask for any of it.", "The relationship with your father is going to be based on your terms and you set the boundaries. He should realize that the relationship needs to be built slowly and taking a trip with him should go outside of your boundaries. He is taking advantage of you and wanting to jump right back into a father role and it\u2019s not going to happen right away. You have nothing to feel guilty about.", "NTA. \n\nYou just found out that the man reaponsible for being your father has shirked his obligations to you, his child. And, in the *6 years* he missed, he was being someone else's father. It's insane that he thought you wouldn't have a problem with this.  He has *a lot* of work to do if he wants to build back the trust he broke.  He's the adult. You are a child.  You owe him nothing.  \n\nThere is no wrong answer on your end. Take your time and decide what kind of relationship you want with him or if you want one at all. It's your choice.", "NTA you are allowed to have and process your feelings.  Relationships with parents are hard especially if you feel unloved by them. I say that if you do wind up talking to your father again set up clear boundaries. Figure out what you are and what you are not willing to do and advocate for yourself. Best of luck to you", "NTA-You\u2019re a human being not a toy. He can\u2019t just decide to stop paying attention to you, come back years later and start paying attention like no time at all has passed or expect you to play happy family with his new family.", "NTA. your father hurt you, and understandably so it will take time to fix. if you want a relationship with him, then go for it. despite him being absent for so long he seems like a decent man, him apologizing and realizing where he messed up is a good thing too. \n\nbut do it on your own terms, do it slowly if you need too, or build the relationship up fast.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe later.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, not one tiny bit. Shame on him for thinking that the first outing he takes you on after being an absent father for so long, has to involve his new girlfriend and her kids. I'm not sure how he expected you to feel about him having time, effort, etc to give to said new girlfriend's kids and not his own. This was a huge mistake on his part. However, no one is perfect, so it's up to you to decide what kind of future your relationship with your father will have. Set clear boundaries with him, and be absolutely honest with your feelings from here on out, but do it in a healthy way (i.e.: no cussing, yelling). Nothing will get resolved if you keep it all inside. Lay everything out on the table, and deal with the issues/feelings one by one with him. If he's not willing to do that WITHOUT anyone else around, then you don't need him in your life.", "NTA. At 14, 6 years is nearly half your life. \n\nTell him he can bring takeout to your moms house and have dinner with you but he needs to be prepared to explain why he couldn't bother for 6 yrs", "NTA It might be possible to build a relationship with your dad, but you are right to set your limits and not pretend it\u2019s all okay.  Also, there\u2019s a very real chance he and his new family remembered that you are a 14F and thought Free Babysitter!!!  I\u2019d be very careful about letting them put you in a position where you could get stuck watching the kids.", "NTA and please don't feel obligated to connect with someone who abandoned you for 6 years and has now found a new family. Take it as slowly as you need to or not at all. Dad owed you a relationship.  Not the other way.", "He doesn't seem like a decent man. Decent men don't completely abandon their kids for six years. Decent men call their children on their birthday if they can't see them. Decent men don't just waltz back in after disappearing from their child's life and expect that they can now just all be a happy family and everything will be forgotten and forgiven.", "And decent men don't reappear after 6 years and start off with \"Hi! Come along with me and see what a good dad I am to kids other than you!\" \n\nI'd say, if OP's bio-dad persists, at the very least have mom run interference and find out \\*why\\* bio-dad has reappeared now, with girlfriend and her kids in tow. Feeling guilty? Nostalgic? Girlfriend asking awkward questions about his ex-family? He needs a kidney?", ">Girlfriend asking awkward questions about his ex-family? \n\nThat was my first thought. She probably didn't like the fact that he had no relationship with his kid and hadn't even seen OP for years. I'd bet money on her being the one who basically forced his hand and encouraged him to reconnect.", "NTA. Sound like he needs a babysitter", "> My mom left us alone so we could talk just the two of us.\n> \n> It was great\n\nINFO: Huh?", "NTA.  Divorce hurts.  Sometimes one parent is more responsible than the other but, deep down, both made mistakes.  So what do we do going forward?  Can we envision a role for dad in your life or not?  I think that every daughter deserves a kind, caring dad that is willing to protect their daughter from the other knuckleheads who only want one thing and will lie, cheat and steal to get it.  My guess is that dad would come running if his daughter was at risk of harm from other men.  Take some time, figure out what kind of relationship you might want from your dad and tell him.  And hold him accountable to that.  I can tell you're a strong woman.  You can do this..", "NTA in this situation and timing, but I hope you get more open to in the future.", "He tried to cross over a river across a bridge he burned. He has to rebuild the bridge first.
