This last weekend she said she couldn't go because her friend from another college (19F, Brooke) was visiting. So then David offered that he could bring a friend, that would be me, for her and Mia finally said yes. Mia knows me from some classes we have together and I think she is a really nice person. I was really nervous about going because I have never been in a real date with a woman and I knew Brooke was going to be totally out of my league but I had the hope that going with David would make me look better by association.\n\nDavid is, quoting what my mom said after meeting him once \"a handsome stud\" and a big ladies' man. He has been with so many women since we started college last year that I have lost count. Mia is in the women's basketball team and David is really set to get her because he  wants to experiment with sexual positions and see how they work with a woman closer in height to him. Brooke was very uninterested in me during the whole night. I tried to talk to her following the tips David gave me but she barely responded and was mostly just looking at her phone. I just knew she was disappointed because of how unattractive I am compared to David and how clearly she was getting the short end of the stick in this date compared to Mia.\n\nWhen the bill came, I paid for Brooke's part and mine. David only paid for his and Mia made a weird face when she realised but didn't said anything about it. After leaving them at their dorm, David was mad at me because he says me paying made him look bad. He says I was showing off because I have more money than him but I swore to him that wasn't my intention. He explained he has too many dates regularly to pay for all so he needs to split. As I said, I don't have any dating experience and I believed the man paying was the usual thing to do. I feel really bad for hurting his chances with Mia knowing how important it was for him and I have apologised profusely multiple times but he is still irritated because of all this.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1681187598, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12i8evp/aita_for_making_my_friend_look_bad_on_a_double/", "score": 379, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But find better friends.", "No, David is the asshole. It was his gathering, his responsibility. If he wanted to split the bill four ways, he should\u2019ve said so ahead of the meal. Mia was evidently disappointed with David, which is not your fault, and Brooke is evidently not a polite young woman - and did not deserve your generosity. \n\nFurthermore, David gets additional asshole status for discussing what ideas he has for having sex with Mia, because she is a similar height to him. This is not the basis for a positive relationship, it\u2019s a young adult plot for a soft porn movie. \n\nDon\u2019t give yourself a hard time for having good manners. Offering to go on a what was blind date for you, was a nice thing to do for all concerned, and the confusion over paying for dinner is not on you. If David is really so busy with dates, there\u2019s a good chance that Mia would meet you for coffee if you took the opportunity to ask her; but don\u2019t assume you have to pay for Mia, or any other girl you ask out.

YTA manly for excusing some horrible behavior of your friend. He sounds like a pig and you\u2019re enabling it. She wasn\u2019t  \u201cplaying hard to get\u201d.

When it rarely does happen that\u2019s probably not a person you\u2019d want to date anyways because they like to play mind games, and that doesn\u2019t make for a healthy relationship. \n\nIf you ever run into a situation where a woman \u201calways has excuses for not going out with him\u201d that is what is called a \u201c[soft no](https://www.doctornerdlove.com/understanding-the-dangers-of-dating/#:~:text=Soft%20no\u2019s%20are%20a%20way,or%20even%20just%20not%20responding.)\u201d.

She only agreed to the double date with her friend because it gave her a chance to \u201cgive David a chance\u201d in a safe manner (as in she\u2019s not alone with him) so she can *finally* get rid of him. David isn\u2019t a \u201cladies man\u201d he\u2019s an annoying sex pest. \n\nTL;DR. Playing hard to get is not a thing. If a woman is interested in you she will say yes to a date. If she \u201calways has excuses\u201d when asked on a date that is her declining to date you, and a clear sign to move on.
