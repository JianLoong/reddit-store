This last weekend she said she couldn't go because her friend from another college (19F, Brooke) was visiting. So then David offered that he could bring a friend, that would be me, for her and Mia finally said yes. Mia knows me from some classes we have together and I think she is a really nice person. I was really nervous about going because I have never been in a real date with a woman and I knew Brooke was going to be totally out of my league but I had the hope that going with David would make me look better by association.\n\nDavid is, quoting what my mom said after meeting him once \"a handsome stud\" and a big ladies' man. He has been with so many women since we started college last year that I have lost count. Mia is in the women's basketball team and David is really set to get her because he  wants to experiment with sexual positions and see how they work with a woman closer in height to him. Brooke was very uninterested in me during the whole night. I tried to talk to her following the tips David gave me but she barely responded and was mostly just looking at her phone. I just knew she was disappointed because of how unattractive I am compared to David and how clearly she was getting the short end of the stick in this date compared to Mia.\n\nWhen the bill came, I paid for Brooke's part and mine. David only paid for his and Mia made a weird face when she realised but didn't said anything about it. After leaving them at their dorm, David was mad at me because he says me paying made him look bad. He says I was showing off because I have more money than him but I swore to him that wasn't my intention. He explained he has too many dates regularly to pay for all so he needs to split. As I said, I don't have any dating experience and I believed the man paying was the usual thing to do. I feel really bad for hurting his chances with Mia knowing how important it was for him and I have apologised profusely multiple times but he is still irritated because of all this.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1681187598, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12i8evp/aita_for_making_my_friend_look_bad_on_a_double/", "score": 566, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Mia was evidently disappointed with David, which is not your fault, and Brooke is evidently not a polite young woman - and did not deserve your generosity. \n\nFurthermore, David gets additional asshole status for discussing what ideas he has for having sex with Mia, because she is a similar height to him. This is not the basis for a positive relationship, it\u2019s a young adult plot for a soft porn movie. \n\nDon\u2019t give yourself a hard time for having good manners.

Would you say the same about a young women who says she wants a big guy for tht saem reason or would you just say \"thats her preference\"?

Lie, flirt and neg them. Dont fall for the lie of \"theyre just young theyll appreciate you when theyre older\". They wont appreciate you, theyll just need you.

Casualties, lots of burns, and and losing yourself in the process but anyway besides the point. \n\nI seriously disagree with your opinion, but I cannot disagree that there are men in this world who are driven by sex appeal and getting in to a woman's bed but I'm not going to let you put the majority of men into this category and say that Opie should follow henceforth. \n\nIt is not a crime to marry or to have been a virgin in to your 30s or 40s, it just means that you waited and you're still waiting for the right person; and when that person comes for Opie he will realize what he is going to get. And yes some people don't get married or in a relationship that works until their 30s or 40s but it just means that it was a journey and it was meant to be in a way.\n\nRespectfully I disagree that on the point of you saying that only castrated or asexual men will be gentlemen two women for that point is just wrong.\n\nAnd we don't know what MIA did or did not do afterwards, she could have very well ended up in his sheets or she could have found some self-respect and realized that this is not the guy that she wants. You and I both know or don't know what is going on in Mia's head at that time but my only advice to Opie is that the world may be a cruel and not a nice place but it doesn't mean you have to write the same question paper as someone else to pass through this life. \n\nA wise woman once told me \"everyone has their own question paper and some people fail because they copy others not realizing that they have their own\". And yeah maybe he will still be a virgin, its not a crime or something to be ashamed of and leaving it for someone special because he knows that when the right girl comes along and he knows her very well then once he shares that special moment with her it will mean so much more.\n\nI see that we both have different point of views but let's agree to disagree and let Opie decide if he wants to give us an update or not. But my point is; \n\n1. Opie being a gentleman is not a waste of time and it shows how respectful he is and his upbringing, \n\n2. people like David should be careful because always jumping into bed with one girl after the other can seriously lead to a big ton of karma.\n\n3. Opie paying for the girl to some seems pointless but let's just remember that the girl must have been dragged into a date she didn't know about and she just came to hang out with her friend. We don't know what was going through her mind at the time so we cannot really say anything about her personality. O p paying for the meal for both of them was a courtesy and we leave it like that, he saw the awkwardness in the air so he just cut his losses and just left. \n\n4. But seriously David admitting that he spends money on dates with countless other women and blaming op for \"showing off\" his money is Quite sad. Because the courtesy is that if you invite a girl out for dinner you are usually supposed to pay, *especially* in his case when he was so persistent. David should have planned better if all he was thinking about was trying to get into a intimate position.", "Becasue its a mutual use. Mia will be in his bed before long. Shes enjoying the attention and chase from an attractive man. She keep doing that and sleeping around until she decides to settle down and then she'll look up a man like OP at the moment and then settle for him. Because her clock is ticking and the men shes actually attracted to arent going to settle down because theyre already getting all the sex they want, why would they want or need a realtionship with a women? Which only brings headaches, unrequited emotional supoort, monetary support, how much time it takes up in your life, having to give up eveything about yourself. Realtionships are distinctly unequal in women's favour. Both the benefits of traditional and modern cultire and none of the downsides of either. Then get divorced in your 40's becasue she changed you or forced you to change so much that youre \"no longer the man she married\". Youll have heard of that one before. Then youll only get to see your kids evey second weekend and pay child support and allimony. What a great deal. \n\nLikely youll say women do emotionally support men in relationships. To an extent and in the moment. But as soon as an argument happens and as has happened in every relationship I've had and evey man I know has had, they will weaponise anything you say in conficnece and use it to hurt you as much as possible.

Its not sowmthing thats easy to fake, especially as I imagine they are living together or nearby in college. \n\nTheres conclusions that men regularly and independently come to. Nice guys finish last was a phrase well before the red pill. Every man can see and find evidence of it in the world around him. \n\nDavid sucks in the eyes of the virtue signalling men here and the older women who despise his kind now they get no attention from them. The majoirty here, not the majoirty of women when they are around him and the men who are jealous of him.\n\nGood try. Cope much.", "Hello neighbour. Yes, Im not exactly hiding it am I? Oh I do, Ive been watching and learning my entire life. I know exactly how women treat certain types of men and in yout gut you know too.\n\nDepends how you define a 'good' man. The reasons for a man to be truly good these days no longer exist. Now you live for yourself. No its not only about sex, its about men living purely for themselves, not what benefits society and women. You will only be successful when you relaise this and bend society to your will, not bend to its.", "*red piller talk\n\nThere are very poigant differences. An incel would bemaon that even if he tried he wouldnt get anywhere and that women are all shallow ect. \n\nNo, he wouslnt say that to Mia, but he would still.show confident sexual intrest. Not just talk to her as a 'nice guy' and put her on a pedestal. Saying you want to fuck her because shes tall is just terrible game.", "Lol, the term is red piller. Incels as the name suggests are involuntary celibate. I am not. \n\nId bet youre an incel but without their philosophy arent you?", "A whole bunch of coping. \n\nI'll repsond to a couple things and they sum up the response to eveything else.\n\nLate virginity. A women as a virgin is not shamed, except by other women. A male virgin is shamed by asshole men yes, but by women as well. Thats why its bad, it hold back men in every way who are trapped in that position. Even the women who dont mock you pity you.\n\nYou do realise the vast majority of men are sex driven right? \n\nIts a dark place to be and it breeds the nihilism and bitter hatred incels are infamous for. \n\nBut I do think David is a shit friend for getting on OP's case for payint, it should ahev been a gentle \"hey you shouldn't do that man, its a waste of your money on a women who cares nothing about you and didnt evn try to be friendly\"", "You're basically :\n\n1. Imagining a (actually several) scenario that never happened and getting mad about it\n\n2. Taking the example of a specific type of shallow people, and generalize that to all men/women, just because in reality that's the kind of people YOU like and notice\n\n3. Have been in toxic relationships with women and decided that because they're not men, those are not toxic relationships and all women are like that. FYI, many abuse victims perpetuate a cycle in which they get abused in every one of their relationships. You need to spot what specifically leads you to repeat the pattern and break it (not saying it's your fault, they're terrible people and it's theirs, but saying repeatedly getting into toxic relationships is absolutely a pattern that can be broken if you reflect on what led you there)\n\nFinally I do know quite a lot about incel ideologies. I even made academic papers about it but that's anecdotal. And the more you speak, the more you sound like an incel, or at least a masculinist. Those are not good things, not for you nor for others. But you probably won't listen to this advice so whatever. Hope you find peace and don't dive deeper into hate.", "Youre just deciding to believe that.\n\nMen AND WOMEN are telling you no one likes a David. But you insist women love Davids and Davids have a lot of success. Well keep your belief then. It obviously makes you unhappy but I'm sure you're keeping it for a reason, such as to blame women and have someone to hate for your problems.\n\nAnd actually no, not every man can see evidence of any of your ideology, hence why most men are telling you you're wrong. But again you just decide those differing opinions don't count and only yours and similar ones do. That's the confirmation bias. You're a believer.", "Sure.", "1) Archetypes of many real situstions and people slived experiences. But because it doesnt happen to women its not real, nice one. \n\n2) You might not want to imagine it, but we are all shallow. Research, which you do seem to want to bring into this, do show the bais towards attractive people. \n\n3) When you (and all of the men you know) have been in one what you designate toxic realtionship (which ironically all of these relatiosnhips are the norm for most men, whcih might say alot about how women treat us) it goes from a confidence, and when you also dramatically chnage how you choose partners as well and it continues then its not coincidental toxic women, its most women. It continues no matter what chnages you make because its common practise for women. Maybe not you, and your female friends might never admit it, because eveyone knows its a horrible thing to do. But many manys still do it. But it is common and every man in most of their realtionships will have had it done to them. That isnt a few bad apples ruisn the bunch. That is the bunch are bad apples. \n\nIts funny you say youve written academically about \"incel ideologies\" the fact you even use that term and not manosphere and dont relaise that incels are a soecific subsection of it with specific beliefs often at odds with other groups you clearly  even if you have written about it, knwo abrely anything about it. \n\nIncels have much more nihilistic and bitter opinions, mine might be bitter, but compared to them, Im a ray of sunshine about women and how they treat men. The term youre looking for is red piller (or pick up artist, as it is a subculture i subscribe to as well). \n\nYou wont listen to anything I say as well, i hope you find true enlightenment, open your eyes and see the truth.", "Same for your own postion. My lines up with what Ive seen throughout my life. Ive seen davids consistently have success. It neither makes me happy or unhappy. Its truth. I dont balme women for their nature, you cant help it. But if you want this world to be a better place then you need to open your eyes and accept it and then wkrk from there. \n\nLol, ask any man, in an environment where he can be honest (read without women) every single one will tell you the same. Its ironic you say that Im deriding others opinions, thats exactly what youre doing haha. Nice use of confirmation bais. But what about gender and sociological bais? What we believe goes strongly against the grain societally, you dont think that would bais you agaisnt considering thsi perspective? \n\nYou really think the reddit community, under this post specifically is representative of the general population? You mention you wrote academic papers under another of my comments, that is the sort of data collection which is widly critiqued in acadmeia. Believe me, Ive written more than a few papers myself. Red pillers are everywhere, in every walk of life and there are more ans mroe of us every day. We just keep our opnions about it to ourslevs so women cannot try and shame us and ruin out lives becasue we see you for who you really are. Youll work with some of us. Youll live near us. And youll never know who.", "Nice reference lol. Its funny you say that. Because Im guessing those women arent willing to admit they've become spinsters and no man wants them anymore. Im willing to bet the men were just being honest and the women arent. Women base alot of their self worth on how much they are desired, and when they are not, they have to pretend its becasue of their own choice or else their whole ego will implode", "Acceptance is the first step. Im proud of you.", "I gotta say I admire how good you got at rationalizing. Unpacking all that would just take time I'm not willing to sacrifice for a guy who won't listen.\n\nThis is beyond a Reddit comment's ability. I wish you to find happiness, and my advice to do so is to say exactly what you're saying all over this thread to a therapist. Good luck in your endeavors, sincerely.", "Ditto. But you mean its above youve ability to argue. Dont blame reddits comments lol.\n\nId wish you happiness, but our society is set up so youll get it no matter what you do. For now."]}
