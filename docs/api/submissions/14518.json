{"id": 14518, "submission_id": "12i8evp", "title": "AITA for making my friend look bad on a double date by not splitting the bill?", "selftext": "My (18M) friend and roommate (19M, David) has been trying to catch this girl (19F, Mia) for weeks but she plays hard to get and always has excuses for not going out with him. This last weekend she said she couldn't go because her friend from another college (19F, Brooke) was visiting. So then David offered that he could bring a friend, that would be me, for her and Mia finally said yes. Mia knows me from some classes we have together and I think she is a really nice person. I was really nervous about going because I have never been in a real date with a woman and I knew Brooke was going to be totally out of my league but I had the hope that going with David would make me look better by association.\n\nDavid is, quoting what my mom said after meeting him once \"a handsome stud\" and a big ladies' man. He has been with so many women since we started college last year that I have lost count. Mia is in the women's basketball team and David is really set to get her because he  wants to experiment with sexual positions and see how they work with a woman closer in height to him. Brooke was very uninterested in me during the whole night. I tried to talk to her following the tips David gave me but she barely responded and was mostly just looking at her phone. I just knew she was disappointed because of how unattractive I am compared to David and how clearly she was getting the short end of the stick in this date compared to Mia.\n\nWhen the bill came, I paid for Brooke's part and mine. David only paid for his and Mia made a weird face when she realised but didn't said anything about it. After leaving them at their dorm, David was mad at me because he says me paying made him look bad. He says I was showing off because I have more money than him but I swore to him that wasn't my intention. He explained he has too many dates regularly to pay for all so he needs to split. As I said, I don't have any dating experience and I believed the man paying was the usual thing to do. I feel really bad for hurting his chances with Mia knowing how important it was for him and I have apologised profusely multiple times but he is still irritated because of all this.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1681187598, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12i8evp/aita_for_making_my_friend_look_bad_on_a_double/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But your friend David is. I doubt Mia is \"playing hard to get.\" She probably can sense David is after one thing and legitimately does not want to date him so I doubt you hurt his chances.", "NTA but I hope you can develop the confidence to be comfortable not paying for someone who clearly has no interest in you.  \n\nAlso, just a pointer, but \u201cmaking excuses\u201d for not wanting to go on a date is just saying no.  You would be wise to respect that up front and drop it.  If it truly is a \u201cplaying hard to get\u201d situation (which I doubt), then you\u2019re beat off finding someone who doesn\u2019t play mind games.  Your young and have lots to learn\u2026..maybe take less lessons from your friend though.", "NTA but if she was ignoring you all night you were too nice paying her bill lol", "NTA, David is. Do NOT try to follow what he does. He disrespects women and is only after sex and that is not a good goal. He only wants Mia for sex positions with someone closer to his height? That\u2019s disgusting. \n\nBe positive, take time to explore the things you like. You will blossom and become more self assured and that is *far* more attractive. David is NOT a good dating role model.", "Lmao Mia isn\u2019t \u201cplaying\u201d hard to get. She\u2019s not interested. David screwed his own date up. You guys sound really girl-obsessed. \n\nNTA. Although kinda a dweeb for paying for brook considering she ignored you and was on her phone all night.", "NTA - Please don\u2019t take tips from this friend. He sounds like a real gem. FYI women do not play hard to get. They make excuses to be polite and men don\u2019t take the hint.", "Whoa whoa whoa! You are NTA here. David is for making you feel bad for being a gentleman. You\u2019re not obligated to cover your date\u2019s meal, but it is nice. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s not your looks, it\u2019s your self confidence. Be more positive, find the things you like about yourself and focus on those. Stop tearing yourself down. People like being around confident, positive people.", "NTA\n\nBut you need to check yourself with this ***\"she plays hard to get and always has excuses for not going out with him.\"*** She just doesn't want to go out with him. That's not *playing hard to get*.", "NTA, but your bro David is trying to get with women to test sex positions? That shit is shallow. Mia probably is not and is therefore holding off. She doesn't want to be the practice sex doll for your friend. \n\nTry to find your own view on women that doesn't involve the words 'hard to get'. And find other people to discuss dating strategies with, David ain't it.", "Oh hun, NTA but your friend is and is a terrible influence. Girl is pretty clearly uninterested in him; I'm sure you're a perfectly attractive guy, and 90 percent of attraction is personality; treat yourself right and you will find someone who will treat you right. I'd take a big step back from David.", "NTA, but David is. He asked both women out as a package deal then only paid for himself because he gets so much action? Nah. He\u2019s a cheap jerk and can only date each woman once since he doesn\u2019t pay. No more double dates with him, he\u2019s an embarrassment.", "NTA but David is for trying to make you feel bad about that. He\u2019s not obligated to pay for Mia but you can do whatever you want.", "Lol, how can you be friends with someone as shallow as this guy?", "No, you are NTA.  You are a gentleman.  Your friend is a player and Mia is better off staying away from him.", "NTA, your friend is the biggest one in this situation. When woman tells you no on a date she isn't playing \"hard to get\" she is not interested. And she agreed to the double date just because she wanted to get rid of your friend's endeavours and because of safety. Going alone with man like your friend can turn to be dangerous for woman. And one dating advice, be yourself, you'll find people who will like you for you.", "NTA but your friend David seems to be. If he wanted so badly to make a good impression on Mia he could have tried a lot harder (and wanted her for more than her height and potential sexual positions). It's fine to pay for your date on a first date without talking about it ahead of time, by the way. Your friend was being cheap.", "NTA \n\nyou are free to pay for whoever u want. and hes free to split. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhowever you are wrong that the man should be paying. stop thinking money will buy you women. \n\nhowever, thats not a reason for him to be rude to you or blame you. if you want to be an atm thats your decision.", "NTA", "NTA because your money your choice, but why did you pay for her?", "NTA but if a woman isn\u2019t giving you the time of day don\u2019t feel obligated to pay for her.", "Mia - AH - expecting date to pay.\n\nBrooke - AH - letting you pay despite ignoring you.\n\nDavid - AH - having a go at you after helping him out with the double date.\n\nYou - NTA", "NTA\n\nWomen don\u2019t \u201cplay hard to date\u201d. They try to politely reject men without rejecting them because they are worried men will lash out\u201d. \n\nWomen give in & bring a friend along hoping it will appease a man enough to leave her alone in the future while she has her friend there for safety. \n\nRegardless of gender, if you ask someone out, especially if you e been actively pursuing the person & the finally give in to you, you pay. \n\nDavid is gross. Paying for the date wouldn\u2019t make him less gross. He\u2019s a wanna be fuck boy. He talks about fucking more than he\u2019s actually fucking. If he were a successful fuck boy, he wouldn\u2019t be talking about it so much.", "NTA for paying. You're not responsible for David's feelings, finances, relationships, or anything else. If he wanted something different, he could have communicated that to you beforehand or talked to you about it respectfully after. David sounds awful, by the way. \n\nBut what's with saying \"she plays hard to get.\" Women having boundaries is not a game. Cut that out.", "NTA. But find better friends.", "No, David is the asshole. It was his gathering, his responsibility. If he wanted to split the bill four ways, he should\u2019ve said so ahead of the meal. Mia was evidently disappointed with David, which is not your fault, and Brooke is evidently not a polite young woman - and did not deserve your generosity. \n\nFurthermore, David gets additional asshole status for discussing what ideas he has for having sex with Mia, because she is a similar height to him. This is not the basis for a positive relationship, it\u2019s a young adult plot for a soft porn movie. \n\nDon\u2019t give yourself a hard time for having good manners. Offering to go on a what was blind date for you, was a nice thing to do for all concerned, and the confusion over paying for dinner is not on you. If David is really so busy with dates, there\u2019s a good chance that Mia would meet you for coffee if you took the opportunity to ask her; but don\u2019t assume you have to pay for Mia, or any other girl you ask out. It\u2019s a nice thing for either party to offer, and it\u2019s a nice thing to share.", "NTA you are a gentleman despite Brooke\u2019s rude attitude but David is a huge AH and Mia should run. You owe him no apology.", "NTA, you are a gentleman and your friend a tight ah.\n\nBut just an advice...she is not playing \"hard to get\", I think  she is not interested in what your friend is \"offering\", which, being crude for what you said, seems like he will pick any girl tall enough to make his sexy trials. Not cool, may leave the girl alone.\n\nYou seem like a nice chap, I would not be taking relationship advice from your friend, he is a player.", "Dude.. YTA manly for excusing some horrible behavior of your friend. He sounds like a pig and you\u2019re enabling it. She wasn\u2019t  \u201cplaying hard to get\u201d. She simply was not interested and probably creeped out. She accepted only because she felt safer with someone else there. And then he showed his true colors by not paying.", "The fact your mum commenting on your 19 year old friend as being a \"handsome stud\" would be largely criticised here if it was reverse gender.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
