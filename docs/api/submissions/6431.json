Holidays growing up were mostly my brother and cousins running around and breaking things while I got in trouble for trying to sneak off to read a book (\"So rude! Pay attention to your family!\"). Now my brother (31M) has six kids (13M, 11F, 8F, 8F, 5F, 3M) and things are exactly the same just with even more kids and chaos than before. \n\nI moved back to my hometown for a job a few months ago. My brother and his wife insisted that I had to do Christmas at their house since I hadn't done the big family thing in four years. I thought I would just drop by, eat some food I didn't have to cook, and leave. \n\nWhen I got to their house it wasn't just them there but also two of our cousins and all of their kids plus some friends of theirs I didn't know. Half the adults were already drinking, the kids were all hyped up *because Christmas*, the tv was turned all the way up. And of course kids are kids, they want attention and hugs and they want to show you what Santa brought them. It's normal! But I'm not normal, and the twins are going through a screeching phase, and the youngest likes to climb people like they're trees, so it was *a lot*. \n\nI tried a few times to take a break in the garage or upstairs guest room but I couldn't get more than five minutes alone before I either had kids following me or SIL coming in going \"Here's auntie! We found her!\" The only place where no one followed me was the laundry room where they had piled all the boxes and wrapping paper from the morning, so for probably half an hour I just sat on the floor like a happy little trash goblin. \n\nWhen I got back to the group people were *PISSED* at me. My SIL and cousins all say that as the only single adult there it was my responsibility to watch the kids so the parents could get the day off (No one actually asked me to do this, just assumed I would). My brother is offended that I would hide from his children (I was hiding from everyone). Even the oldest two kids were mad because they got roped into watching the younger ones when no one could find me (I do feel bad about this). \n\nAITA for hiding from my very noisy family?", "created_utc": 1672796487, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102qag8/aita_for_hiding_from_my_brothers_kids/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Definitely nope nope nope\nIt was never and should never have been your responsibility to watch the kids. They should respect your boundaries as well and if you don\u2019t want to listen to the kids screeching you shouldn\u2019t have to", "NTA - being a single female in a family does not equal to free child caretaker. \n\nYou seem to be an introvert so basically your extremely extrovert brother's family might simply too much for your social battaries. There's nothing wrong with that.", "\"Oh. If you wanted to hire me for babysitting duties, I charge $X per hour per kid with an extra $XYZ holiday fee, payable upfront. Since you didn't tell me about it at least a week ahead of time, that would also incur a late fee.\"\n\nNTA. You are not a babysitter simply because you do not have your own children. That is ridiculous. If your family is only interested in having you there because they plan on putting you to work, treat it the same way you would any other job, and decide whether the wage and working conditions are acceptable to you.\n\nAnd for future 'family events,' I would strongly encourage you to figure out ahead of time if you are being invited as a family member or as an employee. If you are being invited solely to do work, you should feel absolutely no qualms about arranging more enjoyable ways to celebrate your holiday, e.g. \"Sorry, I'm going to my friend's house. I don't feel like working on the holiday, but I'm sure you can find someone else to babysit the kids.\"", "They expected you to babysit, without ever asking, & YOU feel guilty?", "NTA your family\u2019s excuse for you having to watch all those kids is abusive and manipulative. They didn\u2019t even ask. They felt entitled to your time and energy with their lame excuse. If they wanted a day off from the kids so badly, then why even have all those millions of kids in the first place smh", "NTA\n\nBe the \u201cHappy Little Trash Goblin\u201d whenever you feel like it.

I would have done the same (hiding).", "NTA they were trying to use you as a free, unwilling babysitter. Very rude and I would never visit again.", "NTA\u2026as a highly sensitive person to noise and external stimuli, what you just described sounds truly overwhelming. \n\nI\u2019d be hiding right up there with you.", "Oh my god, NTA, that sounds like my own personal hell. And FYI, being the only adult without children does NOT make you the de facto unpaid babysitter.", "NTA.\n\nThey should have told/asked you first, about everything.\n\nBut now you know.  Future gatherings are gonna be little rodeos.  Best to bring your rope and prepare to hogtie all the the little rascals and put them in the laundry room.\n\n(Seriously, maybe you are overblowing your perception of their reaction, and they were not actually angry, just wondering where you were and merely making annoying comments?)", "NTA. Point out that introverts are incredibly drained by social activity and this was off the charts. Furthermore, introverts recharge with quiet, alone time. (Extroverts are the opposite, getting their energy from being social. ) And it sounds as though you're pretty high on the introvert scale. That makes experiencing this event a nightmare scenario for you. \n\nThere are tons of research on this if they don't take your word for it.", "NTA\n\nNext time you you are asked to visit say no.

It\u2019s their responsibility as parents to watch their own kids. It\u2019s extremely unfair to expect you to be the designated but never asked babysitter just because your single. Especially when you\u2019re the guest.  If this is why they invited you, they learned a hard lesson that it was not appropriate or tolerated by you.  \n\nNext time they invite you, be wary of the intentions. Also make it very clear you will not be on babysitting duty for them. Or bring a date. Either way you need to set your boundaries with them.", "NTA   They don't get to dub you the babysitter in chief just because they want the day off. I suffer in these kinds of environments myself, so I can relate to your wanting a moment of reprieve. And kid's generally have no chill. Maybe let these other adults know that you will not be the designated babysitter and if they need the day off they can ask some willing soul to come and do this job.", "\" as the only single adult there it was my responsibility to watch the kids so the parents could get the day off\"\n\nUnadulterated bullshit. Had someone told me that I would have organized extremely loud and messy and mildly destructive games for them. 'gee, I wonder what happens if you shake these cans of soda reaaaally hard?' But I'm that type.\n\nNTA", "NTA. As someone who also grew up reading books in the corner while everyone did what they wanted to, there's nothing wrong with you. Your family is the asshole though for thinking you'd act as a babysitter, especially without telling or ASKING you. If they wanted child-free time then they should've hired a babysitter or...not had any kids to begin with.", "Totally NTA.   You are not required to interact with people and especially not watch their kids.  \n\nFYI- You sound like you might be an enneagram 5.  I have quite a few in my family, learning about it really resonated with me.", "Wtf? No NTA, uh do NOT feel bad if they wanted a day off go higher a nanny\u2026or maybe don\u2019t have a ton of kids.", "NTA, honestly it sounds like they just wanted free babysitting.  Your brother, his wife, and any other adult that tried to disregard your needs is absolutely an AH.", "Now you know why they wanted you there. To watch the kids. Not for love. Because they thought they could take advantage of you. They are the a-holes.", "NTA!  I would have been hiding under the boxes right there with you.  My sister had 3 children fairly close together and just calling her on the phone and hearing the chaos in her house exhausted me.  I am so offended on your behalf.  Your family knows that you're quiet, so why in the world would they think you'd want to come over and have a house full of hyped-up, sticky, and screeching children dumped on you?  That sounds like the 8th circle of hell.  Do yourself a favor - learn to say \"NO!\".  Book yourself and a stack of books into a nice, quiet, child-free resort next year over the holidays.  Put everyone on an information diet so they don't know what you're doing and when they invite you over so you can ~~have a pleasant visit~~ babysit, just say no.  It is okay to not want to be around children and to do what you want on the holidays.", ">My SIL and cousins all say that as the only single adult there it was my responsibility to watch the kids so the parents could get the day off (No one actually asked me to do this, just assumed I would).\n\nAaaaaand there's why you \"had to do Christmas at their place.\" Not because you \"hadn't done the big family thing in four years.\" You were the free help and they didn't like you refusing the role.\n\nTotal NTA.", "What is this, 'single people have to babysit' crap?
