And of course kids are kids, they want attention and hugs and they want to show you what Santa brought them. It's normal!

That is ridiculous. If your family is only interested in having you there because they plan on putting you to work, treat it the same way you would any other job, and decide whether the wage and working conditions are acceptable to you.\n\nAnd for future 'family events,' I would strongly encourage you to figure out ahead of time if you are being invited as a family member or as an employee.
