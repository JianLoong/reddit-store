In fact, if your mom insists on sitting in on one session, let her, and make that the session you talk to the therapist about strategies in getting privacy for your therapy. (Update - that is a frivolous and unhelpful comment, sorry.

The space created between a therapist and their patient is important and allows things to be shared that you wouldn't feel comfy sharing with others.

Your mother seems to have a case of selective eavesdropping. While it's understandable that she may be concerned about your well-being, invading your privacy and attempting to manipulate your therapy sessions is crossing a line. Therapy is meant to be a safe space for you to open up and work through your personal struggles. Just because she's your mother doesn't give her the right to be a permanent audience member in your sessions. You have the right to set boundaries and protect your privacy. Keep standing up for yourself and communicate your feelings calmly but assertively.

Ending therapy left me emotionally stunted and going undiagnosed with mental health issues for several years.

What your mother is doing is wrong and harmful. You should not be harassed into giving up your privacy. Therapy is designed to be confidential. It's crucial to the process.\n\nAsk your therapist to explain the confidentiality rules to you so that you understand what your rights are, and under what (very rare) circumstances they are required to break confidentiality. Then ask for their help in figuring how to handle your mom's inappropriate attempts to violate the confidentiality of your sessions. \n\nUnfortunately, because you are a minor your mom has the power to make life hard for you if you don't bend to her will. It's unfair. I'm so sorry. But it's why it'll be helpful to have the therapist's advice on how to handle this delicate situation so it doesn't get worse. Good luck.

Legally your conversation with your therapist is privileged, and your parent can be told vague generalities of your session, but are not entitled to specifics.\n\nThe easiest way to deal with this would be to actually let her 'join' a session, and then tell your therapist that you would rather NOT have your mom present during your session.

Other than the obvious argument that you are entitled to privacy with a therapist, may I add that it is essential for you to feel in a safe space when you\u2019re there? How are you supposed to work through your problems if you don\u2019t even feel free talking about them? Also, I hope your therapist is reinforcing this with mom too.\n\nI always try to look at people who have hurtful behaviour as people who are hurting. It helps me understand them, accept the situation and find solutions much better. In this case, we know mom is highly apprehensive and is probably worried about what you are going through as a teenager and as a person with said diagnosis. If I can take a long shot, I would guess she feels responsible for your feelings and probably has a personal need for control. This does not in any way excuse her actions, but it might help us better understand where she comes from, if that checks with you (cause you\u2019re obviously the only one who could know for sure).\n\nWhat do you think of trying this type of approach? \u201cMom, I can see it\u2019s hard for you to accept that I\u2019m going through a hard time. But if I am in fact going to counseling, it is precisely because I wanna try to feel better. I know that I need help to deal with this, and your support is so important to me, but I need to get professional help. And that is only effective if I can create a safe space where it is just me and my therapist talking, and I don\u2019t need to worry about anything else.\u201d\n\u201cI would be happy to open up with you too someday, but I think I still need time to digest the situation and I need to learn how to take care of myself on my own in this.\u201d\n\u201cIf you are worried about something specific and that\u2019s why you feel the need to listen to my private thoughts, I just want you to know that I would feel so much more understood by you if you asked me directly\u201d\n\nYou know, sometimes moms can be assholes, sometimes they can just be so f worried and doing the best they can. I honestly wouldn\u2019t know what to label this delicate situation, only you can know. Still I suggest going with the soft approach first, and then imposing yourself more if she keeps intruding your privacy.\n\nI really don\u2019t mean to step over the line with this post, it\u2019s just I have gone through some of this myself and I wanted to give it my best try at saying something useful.\n\nHope everything works out!", "NTA.  Do NOT tell your mom.  Therapy is private for a reason.  It's a safe place for you to talk about your feelings.  And to talk about your mom if necessary.

I hope you are talking to your therapist about what she's doing.   Keep telling her no & if she gets mad, too bad for her.  You're not doing anything wrong.

I can also sit it on any session I want to be present. This is regardless of the wishes of the minor child.\n\nOf course the therapist could always deny treatment.
