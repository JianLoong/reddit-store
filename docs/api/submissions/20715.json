I fell bad for her and I do love her but sometimes she can be a bit much. Just a few years ago I got diagnosed with depression, anxiety disorder,\nPTSD, and anorexia.

But this is where the problem started, just about two weeks ago 1 had my weekly check in with my therapist it was online since was visiting my moms house but the thing I found odd was that my mom wanted to sit in during my therapy. I asked her if she could leave the room because I wanted privacy but she responded with I am your mother I should be able to hear what you're saying. I argued that I didn't sit in during her therapy sessions so why should she have to sit through mine. As usual when she gets mad she storms out the room I didn't know whether to feel relieved or worried for what might happen after my session. Later on that day she seemed fine but then just last week\n\u2022 she was nailing me down about what I was talking to my therapist about. I told her it was talking to my therapist about. I told her it was none of her business Because it was very personal and private, she just sat quiet. Just the other day I found out that she was trying to talk to my counselor to figure out what I was saying to them, then talked to my dad and my aunts to see if I told them what I was talking about. My dad is on my side about it but my aunts seem to be taking my mom side and are calling me disrespectful brat. I don't know what to do.

You're entitled to privacy in your therapy sessions.\n\nTalk to the therapist about it - they might have some helpful strategies. In fact, if your mom insists on sitting in on one session, let her, and make that the session you talk to the therapist about strategies in getting privacy for your therapy. (Update - that is a frivolous and unhelpful comment, sorry. You're fully entitled to privacy in your therapy sessions, you don't have to tell anyone what you talk to your therapist about, and you don't need to say why you want privacy - you're just entitled to it, for any reason, or none.)  \n\n\nAsk your aunts if they're willing to have (a) you or (b) your mom sitting in on THEIR therapy sessions.", "NTA. Your time with your therapist is private.\n\nThat said, it sounds like your mom is struggling with a lot of things and may be trying to gain control however she can. You are by no means required to do so, but you might talk to her about the two of you seeing a family therapist together that is completely separate from the individual therapist you're already seeing.", "100% NTA. The space created between a therapist and their patient is important and allows things to be shared that you wouldn't feel comfy sharing with others. It's supposed to be non-judgemental.\n\nYour mother is being incredibly nosy and violating that space. You've every right to tell her, and anyone who agrees with her, to back off.", "NTA\n\nMom is a massive snooping AH. Therapy is supposed to be a safe space for you, so you can be truly free to say/explore your issues. Having your mom chip in will break that space and impede your therapy.\n\nOn top of that, when a dysfunctional parent is trying to know what happened during the session of their child, there's a high probability that it will be used later on against the child...", "NTA. Your mother seems to have a case of selective eavesdropping. While it's understandable that she may be concerned about your well-being, invading your privacy and attempting to manipulate your therapy sessions is crossing a line. Therapy is meant to be a safe space for you to open up and work through your personal struggles. Just because she's your mother doesn't give her the right to be a permanent audience member in your sessions. You have the right to set boundaries and protect your privacy. Keep standing up for yourself and communicate your feelings calmly but assertively. And if your aunts are taking your mom's side without fully understanding the situation, it might be worth explaining it to them as well. Stay strong and prioritize your mental health.", "NTA!!\n\nGrowing up, my NDad chose to sit in on one of my therapy sessions and then pulled me out altogether because he didn\u2019t like what I said (I told the therapist I was concerned about his alcohol intake and the therapist tried to talk to him about getting help, which only made him madder). Ending therapy left me emotionally stunted and going undiagnosed with mental health issues for several years. It\u2019s insane to think what my life could\u2019ve been if I had gotten the intervention/help I needed sooner. \n\nI get the vibe your mother is trying to do the same exact thing.", "Do not tell anyone anything you don't want them to know. Like you said it's not their business! NTAH", "NTA!! This is private, and you deserve a space to be able to speak freely. She is likely insecure about  your relationship because she knows deep down she hasn\u2019t always been the best support. This is her problem and insecurity, so hold your ground and keep advocating for your own safe space.  You\u2019ve clearly been through a lot and are lucky to have found a therapist to form a trusting bond with. You keep doing you, and role model to her what you need in a healthy relationship. Boundaries. Mutual respect.  Independence.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I\u2019d suggest talking with your dad and therapist about cutting your mom out. If she can\u2019t respect your privacy in this setting, she doesn\u2019t deserve access to your life.", "NTA. Your mom is probably part of the problem and traumas which manifest in anxiety and ptsd. Check out youtube: Irene Lyon, about stored survival stress and anxiety. Really mind opening stuff there and should fit the bill here.", "NTA, you\u2019re entitled to your privacy during therapy sessions and the things you discuss with your therapist are none of her business.", "NTA. What your mother is doing is wrong and harmful. You should not be harassed into giving up your privacy. Therapy is designed to be confidential. It's crucial to the process.\n\nAsk your therapist to explain the confidentiality rules to you so that you understand what your rights are, and under what (very rare) circumstances they are required to break confidentiality. Then ask for their help in figuring how to handle your mom's inappropriate attempts to violate the confidentiality of your sessions. \n\nUnfortunately, because you are a minor your mom has the power to make life hard for you if you don't bend to her will. It's unfair. I'm so sorry. But it's why it'll be helpful to have the therapist's advice on how to handle this delicate situation so it doesn't get worse. Good luck. I hope your mom backs off.", "100% not the AH. Legally your conversation with your therapist is privileged, and your parent can be told vague generalities of your session, but are not entitled to specifics.\n\nThe easiest way to deal with this would be to actually let her 'join' a session, and then tell your therapist that you would rather NOT have your mom present during your session. That way your mom can argue with your therapist, and not you.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA\n\nLet your dad and therapist know that your mum is pushing the issue, and that you don't want her to have access to your therapy sessions. Your therapist should be able to tell you about what will happen if your mum calls them, if there's any info she can access as your parent etc.", "she responded with I am your mother I should be able to hear what you're saying. --- this is not normal at all. mom needs her own therapy by the looks of it.\n\nOP NTA and you have to set up boundaries and enforce them strictly- even when it comes to your partner, parents, kids or friends."]}
