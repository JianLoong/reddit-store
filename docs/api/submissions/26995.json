I also told him that it was a one time thing and that the website isn't active anymore.   \n\n\nHowever he looked horrified and told me that I broke his trust.

I've seen what happens to a kid when his mom's porn tape gets found and it was pretty horrific.  I've seen 2 examples and it was enough that it became a question I asked back in my dating days. \n\nThat said, I don't have a verdict. I get why you hid it. I get why he's upset.  I'm guessing family  therapy is in your future.", "I'm not sure how to vote at the moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's this weird mish-mash of (1) your body, your choice, (2) sex with other people before you're in a relationship with someone current is nothing to be mad about...\n\nvs\n\n...(3) At least letting your spouse know that there is straight up hardcore porn of you out there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd have been quite shocked if after ten years of marriage, my wife told me that actually she had been a porn actress, even once. It'd be another weird mish-mash of why didn't she tell me, what else didn't she tell me, is she maybe doing this now?\n\nI mean.. he could have come across the old thing on any number of sites, I'm sure, so it's better that he at least learned now. But 10 years into the marriage. I dunno. I can understand not wanting to tell him, but I can also understand taking it really the wrong way to have it just sort of casually dribble out 10 years into marriage and however long after it happened/relationship began.\n\nBut like I said, to me it seems to be bigger than just past relationships (which, if someone is angry about, that someone is probably an asshole). Is it that embarrassment at first stopped you but then after enough time passed, it didn't?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMay very well be NAH *now*, but things depend on what you both do next, imo.", "I honestly don't understand why you'd tell him after 10 years. I mean, I understand he feels very weird about this and wonders what else you never told him. I don't think anyone is the asshole, but what exactly did you expect here?", "YTA. There are a number of things that one should discuss with one's spouse prior to getting married, such as: having a criminal record, previous marriages and/or children, outstanding arrest warrants and being a porn actress or involved in sex work. \n\nNot everyone will have an issue with any or all of the above, but if you want to build a life with someone, you should be upfront about things that may destroy the relationship in the future.", "It does matter I\u2019m sorry. A lot of people would feel uncomfortable being with someone that has done porn. It is something that your future kids could stumble upon, it is something that can have an impact unto his life. \n\nYou robbed him of that choice and lied by omission. YTA. Honesty is the only way to a proper relationship and you weren\u2019t honest. This isn\u2019t a small thing, it\u2019s big. As I have said previously, this could have consequences in his own life. You took away his decision.", "YTA. \n\nOmission of being in a porn video would be a big deal to many people.", "YTA. One would think someone would want to know their spouse was involved in such an ordeal. You say you and your husband are close but not close enough for you to be open and honest about your past? It\u2019s time to sit down and get everything out in the air. Are there other things you haven\u2019t disclosed? He probably feels like he married woman who would and wouldn\u2019t do certain things and he just found out he married someone with much different standards.", "YTA because communication is key to a marriage and that was a material ommission.

He for his reaction.", "Yeah that isn't going away. Still got that 1500? May need it for a lawyer", "I\u2019m curious on how many men here who would have a problem with it, also consume porn in any capacity. \n\nI dont think doing a porn video in college makes you a porn actress any more than acting in a single play makes you an actor. A lot of her husband\u2019s issues stem from the stigmatization of sex work rather than the act itself. Is it nice thinking about your partner getting railed? Not really, but unless they\u2019re a virgin you can\u2019t really escape it. \n\nNTA, OP.", "Am I the asshole for lying by omission?", "Post the video", "NTA\n\nHow can you have broken his trust for something you did before you met him?", "NTA, I don\u2019t understand all the Y-T-A comments. I\u2019m a little surprised this hadn\u2019t come up earlier in your relationship but I\u2019ve heard crazier stories from people much later in their relationships. The fact that he\u2019s willing to risk a 10 year relationship because you made one amateur porn video once in college is kind of insane to me as well.  It feels to me like if you were in an amateur theatre production in college and then he flipped out that you didn\u2019t tell him you were an actress at some point in your life. You made one video once. If it had been your career or something, sure, that\u2019s a huge omission, but this? He\u2019s valid in being upset about it, but his reaction is waaay overkill and immature. I understand other commenter\u2019s concerns about children being bullied for their parents being in the adult entertainment industry, but one college amateur video for a now defunct website does not a career sex worker make. A reasonable adult would sit down with their partner and discuss their feelings, their fears, and trust that their partner of *10 years* that they have trusted to have children with would not be so careless or malicious as to omit information that could significantly affect their relationship and their future.", "NTA. Your body, your choice. But you should\u2019ve taken that to your grave.", "YTA, why on earth would you not have disclosed this before marriage, let alone having a child? \n\nIf I were in his shoes, that would be a nasty lingering thought for a long time", "Just post video here for reference \u2026.\n\nKidding. NTA", "broke his trust? in what way?? it happened in the past and had nothing to do with him in any way. he can be upset to just be learning this, but it has nothing to do with trust. has he readily divulged every small detail of his own life to you?? that\u2019s insane. it feels heightened no doubt because of the connotations of sex work, but you owe no one every little detail from your life. talk to him about why he thinks trust was broken, because i\u2019m betting it\u2019s more judgement than anything. nta", "Sauce?\n\nNTA", "Yeah to me this is also ESH really. You lied by omission but also he is wildly overreacting to something that happened ONCE before he ever met you. Also, the fact that he ran to his parents and blabbed about something rather personal puts him in the wrong too. He should have let you two talk this out privately like adults.", "NTA. While many might find it shocking to learn their partner did a porn video - it happened before you met him and in no way is any break of trust. \n\nHe and the family are dramatically over reacting and sound horribly judgmental. In current times with everyone having smart phones with cameras people are sexting and posting videos and doing only fans and other similar sites for $ or just for fun. \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t matter if you did it for years. It doesn\u2019t change who you are or who you have been since the day you met him. It\u2019s not like you have continued doing it behind his back. \n\nHe is reacting to this poorly - maybe he is shocked and maybe he is judging you and is disappointed to learn this about you. That seems wrong to me. He could discuss it with you openly and even if he is unhappy or disapproves it\u2019s irrelevant - as it\u2019s long past and before his presence in your life. \n\nI\u2019m sorry he is reacting this way.  It may require some marriage counseling to get past this. But honestly I feel like he is being a bit melodramatic about it. \n\nGood luck. I hope things will work out.", "If you two get back together make sure to spill all his secrets to your parents in return. Because he essentially lost your trust, no\nDoubt", "NTA.  These comments are crazy.  You made 1500 bucks in college for a day\u2019s work.  If there\u2019s a problem here it\u2019s his.", "YTA for telling him. If there was no likely way for him to find out and it's been 10 years you should not have shared that. \n\nThe real question is whether it was boy+girl or solo. I have a feeling it's the former by your not describing it.", "NTA! Also trust, like law  is not retroactive, wtf is he going on about. On the contrary it was an act of trust to disclose that at all, he is not entitled to knowledge of for you irrelevant tidbits of your past. And taking your kid, how come?", "NTA...It really isn't any of his business.", "NTA because this was years before you met your husband, you didn't do anything wrong, and very few of us were angels in college.  I am curious, though, why you told him or why you hadn't told him before.", "NTA. You are under no obligation to tell anyone anything about your life before them. Your past acts have no influence on the current situation. If he feels like it does, the question I would have is why? His reason will be telling.", "Imo NTA. What does that change? Youre still the same you. It wasnt a crime. Im sure hes done things in college hes not proud of.", "NTA not sure why these things matter now when they havent matter for the past 10 years. Its obvious to me you werent hiding it but didnt really think it was important enough to mention (based on your wording and the casual nature it was brought up)", "NTA, although I fully understand why your husband felt how he did on finding out. I was leaning towards nah, but where he becomes TA imo is when he goes to his parents & tells them all of this. He feels betrayed by you not telling him before/sooner, then immediately justifies your caution by breaking that confidence to tell other people who are phoning you up to hurl abuse at you.", "NTA\ntbh i get why he's upset (at the moment) because it's shocking and he probably was caught of guard. I would be upset too if my partner told me something like that after us together after 10 year. BUT, I think he should, after thinking, get over it. I mean, yeah, it's shocking and upsetting, but ending an relationship over that without even discussing it would be crazy.", "When will woman understand.

It depends on why it was never brought up. But if you meet someone and their character is sound would you really not want a relationship with them because of something stupid they did years before ?

I\u2019m one for giving second chances. And I didn\u2019t get any impression that this \u201csecret\u201d was purposely concealed or that it just never came up.

It isn't anything serious enough that it needed to be stated upfront.", "Hard disagree. Marriage doesn\u2019t mean you own everything about the person. It\u2019s a commitment to their life together now and moving forward. If I was sexually assaulted I would be under no obligation to inform my significant other. I\u2019m under no obligation to tell them about my past partners.\n\nThere isn\u2019t any info here, but I\u2019d wager that she didn\u2019t tell her husband about past sexual encounters because this never came up, and it wasn\u2019t a malicious hidden piece of her past if we take the story at face value. They clearly had a relationship where he never asked about that, OR she\u2019s lying by omission and he did. If he did ask previously and she left it out, then it\u2019s a breach of trust, but the implication I see in the info we have is that he didn\u2019t. She seems surprised he\u2019s angry, which leads me to believe she never considered he would be, which leads me to believe she didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. If it\u2019s not a big deal and not a malicious hide, she would have included it in her body count when asked. I don\u2019t think he asked. If he didn\u2019t ask then why is it important now?\n\nSo in a way you\u2019re right, but it\u2019s VERY situational. If he asked and she lied she is. If he never asked she isn\u2019t.", "Why is it something a life partner and co-parent would want/deserve to know?", "Yes I would not be in a relationship with someone who used to do porn.
