{"id": 5895, "submission_id": "zxrljh", "title": "AITA for bringing my husband dinner, and kissing him good night?", "selftext": "One of my good friends, I\u2019ll call her Katie, is going through a devastating breakup. She was supposed to get married on New Year\u2019s Eve. Last week, her now ex fianc\u00e9 told her that he can\u2019t marry her. \n\nThis week was supposed to be last minute wedding prep. Katie is having a rough time. Last night, I took her out to dinner. We drank a ton of wine, came back, drank at my house, and she spent the night. She seemed a bit off this morning, but I figured it was the emotions and a hangover. She left earlier than I thought she would, but I figured she wanted to be alone. \n\nI got a text from Katie around noon saying \u201cyou should be more considerate about the fact that im not getting married and you are married.\u201d I had no idea what she was talking about. I hardly saw my husband (Jeff) last night, Katie and I were focused on each other. He did his own thing on a different floor. She sent more texts accusing me of rubbing my marriage in her face. My crimes:\n\n1. When we were out to dinner, I got my husband takeout. She says that I shouldn\u2019t have done so because it reminded her she doesn\u2019t have a (future) husband. \n2. My husband came to us to alert me he was going to bed. I gave him a peck and said I love you, good night. We say this every night. It\u2019s so routine I don\u2019t even fully realize I\u2019m doing it. She says this was the ultimate most disrespectful thing. \n3. I slept in bed with my husband. I have a bad back. We have a nice mattress.\n\nI did not bring up my husband at all last night. He was on another floor, except for when I handed him his food and then when he said good night. Katie has always adored Jeff. She asked me at a few points about Jeff and how we are doing, but I pivoted every time. \n\nAfter a barrage of texts basically calling me a horrible friend, I finally asked \u201cshould I have just sent Jeff away?!\u201d I was being sarcastic. She said \u201che could\u2019ve had a boys night\u2026\u201d Jeff worked today. I didn\u2019t.  \n\nAITA? Am I horribly inconsiderate?\n\nETA: I should have included this. My husband has always kept Katie at an arms length. He\u2019s long felt like she is in competition with everyone, especially me. I am beginning to think he\u2019s right that the friendship is not fully healthy.", "created_utc": 1672277241, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxrljh/aita_for_bringing_my_husband_dinner_and_kissing/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friend is a drama queen. I\u2019m tired of her and I don\u2019t even know her.", "NTA - I\u2019m beginning to understand why your friends fianc\u00e9 called the wedding off", "NTA. But it's clear why she isn't getting married. I wouldn't put up with that level of self-centered behavior. You just existing in a married state is somehow about her? Like, what? No, that's no bueno", "NTA. No wonder he left her. We all need space from her now.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s projecting her drama on to you. But I\u2019d leave her to her dramatics for a while. Perhaps one of her bridesmaids or family can handle her for the moment. And don\u2019t answer her on NYE. Yeesh.", "NTA but you are giving this woman far too much credit.  You shouldn't have to justify sleeping in bed with your husband or kissing him goodnight.    \n\nI would gently but firmly tell her that you care about her but you are not going to mistreat your husband just to soothe her wounded feelings.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that she is having a shit time but don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep others warm.\n\nYou did nothing wrong and she\u2019s being ridiculous.", "NTA, does she expect you to kick your husband out for her? You were being accommodating and a good friend. I\u2019d say if your interactions were over the top (large romantic gestures, etc.) then maybe, but giving him food and a kiss goodnight is not rubbing it in her face.", "INFO: Do you in general lack a sense of right and wrong? Also, why are you friends with this person?\n\nNTA at all, those are some bull reasons shes giving. But again, she is one to hijack new years eve for her wedding, so im not surprised that she cant handle when the focus isnt on her (which isnt even true, but you know what im saying)", "NTA Everything you did was reasonable and you were totally there for her, above and beyond. She's just facing a lot of hurting and looking for somewhere to put it. Hopefully she'll come to her senses and apologize.", "NTA. I'm sorry her life is currently upended. Yours is not, and you should not have to act like it is to make her feel better. I understand she is grieving what could've been, but her expectations are ridiculous. You weren't bragging or boasting; you were simply carrying on as you should while still being her shoulder to cry on. Your life can't stop for her.", "NTA.  Your friend is hurt and is lashing out.  Hopefully she will come to her senses soon and apologize to you.\n\nYou did the right thing by not censoring your relationship to your husband.  Doing so would have done your friend a disservice.  You helped her by spending time with her in her time of need.", "NTA - I get she\u2019s hurting, but yeesh, those are some seriously unbalanced expectations. Does she just want you to pretend that you don\u2019t have a husband in her presence or what? Will she harass couples she sees on the streets???\n\nShe needs to curb her entitlement here. It\u2019s okay for her to express her feelings, but *not* to try to control/dictate your marriage just because she\u2019s now single.", "NTA. It\u2019s normal to be upset/sad/angry about a breakup like this and it\u2019s normal to be be respectful of someone\u2019s feelings. But you didn\u2019t do anything wrong or ostentatious and she doesn\u2019t seem to be resenting you reminding her of the *person* but rather the *status symbol* she lost.", "NTA\n\nYikes. Perhaps a gentle suggestion that she hang out with single friends for awhile to prevent her feelings from being hurt is best. Maybe be a listening ear and when she's in a better emotional place you can hang out again", "NTA.  These are typical behaviors within a healthy marriage.  Did she expect him to not be allowed in his own home while y\u2019all were there?  Did she expect you to 100% ignore him?  I would say that these reactions/expectations are a leading reason why she is no longer getting married.  Sounds to me like she needs to see a therapist, not the bottom of a wine bottle\u2026", "NTA. What a crabby \"friend\" you have! You were doing nothing out of the ordinary with your husband. What, is everyone supposed to not mention their spouses around this woman because she's not getting married?\n\n\"I slept in bed with my husband.\" This is a serious complaint? Good grief! Kissing your husband goodnight is \"the ultimate most disrespectful thing\"? I can't believe it.\n\nMaybe you can attribute it to the alcohol. But you have nothing to apologize for and you should seriously consider distancing yourself from this \"friend.\"\n\nHonestly, why do people expect to be so coddled? It's like they expect to be able go thru life and not be upset by anything another person might do.\n\nNTA.", "Nta. Not surprising her fiance didn't want to follow through with the marriage.", "NTA\n\nYour friend is a train wreck internally and the best she can figure is that if she  subconsciously craps on you, she will feel better. She won't. She probably knows you can handle her lashing out (again, not consciously), so is venting her pain. I think a lot of us tend to do this when we are hurt. I would hope that she doesn't mean it, but there's always that chance. I would let her have a little space, her own cool down time, but send her thinking of you texts and similar. I actually have abandonment issues, so the fiance taking off would send me spiraling, and then if I push my friend away, I would just be so sick. I wouldn't take anything to heart right now. You're a very good friend.", "NTA.\nIf she has a problem with your happy relationship, that's HER problem. You did NOTHING wrong.", "NTA. Your \u2018friend\u2019 seems to not have any idea what a healthy relationship, whether friendship or romantic, works.", "NTA. Her accusations are delusional. Now I\u2019m curious if her behavior is the reason her fianc\u00e9 broke it off.", "NTA\n\nI can understand why those things made your friend feel sad. She's hurting and seeing a happy relationship probably made it a little worse.\n\nIs that your fault or responsibility to fix? Not even a little bit. It would be one thing if your husband was like bringing you flowers in the middle of you hanging out with your friend or you like, idk, interrupted her being upset to show her your wedding album? But just existing in your house with your husband is not over (or near) the line.\n\nShe knows you're married. She didn't have to go to your house.\n\nI hope that when she gets herself back together a bit she realizes she's in the wrong. She's going through a lot and we all get crazy sometimes. That doesn't mean you have to indulge it though.", "NTA, and I think that your husband has it right.", "NTA.   Are you supposed to pretend you are not married because her plans fell through.  I\u2019m wondering if her true colors are showing.  I would just back away from her for the time being.  You are not responsible for her sadness or happiness.", "NTA - She\u2019s in a bad place and directing her anger at the wrong person. Give her some space and hopefully she will realise how unrealistic she was and apologise to you.", "Nta", "NTA.  Good gods, your friend is overreacting and trying to be mad instead of sad.  Poor coping mechanism.", "NTA.  And wtf??  She's delusional.  If she can't handle being around someone married right now that's on her to handle by, well, not being around married people.  She's pissed that you Slept In Your Own Bed??  Trauma aside, she's not much of a friend.", "NTA. Katie thinks misery loves company and is trying to tear you down to make herself feel better, or at least distract herself. \n\nMight be time to take a note from your hubby and keep her at arms length.", "NTA.\n\nKatie is hurting, and for whatever reason, she has chosen to take it out on you today.  I know it's hard, but try not to take it personally.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your friend may deserve some grace because she's going through something traumatic, but it sounds like she has a pretty serious case of main character syndrome. Your life doesn't and shouldn't revolve around her. You were being a good friend and she interpreted you also being a good wife as a personal insult. If this is how she always is, it might be worth reconsidering the friendship. If it's abnormal because she's hurting, it still isn't your problem and you shouldn't modify your behavior to make her less jealous.", "NTA.\n\nThe world doesn't revolve around her.  \nWhat does she expect you to do? Divorce your husband because she can't get a man?", "NTA, she is obviously feeling pretty down on any relationship right now though, would she hurt herself?", "NTA. You are being a good friend but you didn't stop being married because she's single now. She's expecting too much, the world doesn't revolve around her.", "NTA. While I understand that Katie is upset and very emotionally raw at the moment, wow, is she irrational or what!\n\nYou did nothing wrong. Neither did your husband.", "Obviously the problem is you didn\u2019t serve your husband divorce papers immediately upon her fianc\u00e9 dumping her.\n\n\nTotally \ud83d\udcaf NTA.", "NTA- she is clearly overreacting out of the shock & pain she\u2019s in and taking it out on you. Stop debating with her and just simply say \u201cI\u2019m very sorry you are going through this and I should have  realized seeing me with Jeff would remind you of it. I apologize as I am your friend\u201d. Debating or trying to reason with her will just make her more upset and you the misplaced focus of her anger. \n\nWhen she comes through the shock, she will realize that it was an overreaction and you both can move forward in your friendship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
