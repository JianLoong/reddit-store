At that small his biggest worries should be learning to edit better, learning to improve audio in editing software as best as possible, and finding out if his own personality can work for a gaming channel (judging by his behavior, no) because those are the core things you need when starting a YouTube gaming channel. Those are still important parts of any gaming channel.\n\nAlong with this, if he's worried about his friends' audio and it NEEDS to be better, he has two options. Either help you improve your current microphone's audio or buy you a new microphone himself. Hell, we pooled our money together and bought one of my best friends a gaming PC just so he could play on PC with us, and that wasn't for anything besides wanting him to be able to play a couple games with us.\n\nHis priorities are definitely misaligned between his friends and his YouTube channel. Now, this may be slightly different as I don't get to do things with my two best friends often, but I've missed entire days that I could be working or filming just to play video games or hang out with my two best friends. My YouTube does not come before my friendships. I'd like to think my YouTube has a better chance than the average normal gaming channel, but it should never and will never take priority over my friendships.

Max needs to calm down and not record every single session  you guys have - he is perfectly in his rights, however, to only include certain people in sessions he schedules *specifically* for recording, if that's what he chooses to do. \n\nYou aren't being a bad friend by being upset at not being included, but telling him he's going nowhere may have been a bit of an angry snap on your part. \n\nThat's not why you're an asshole, though. *YOU* are an asshole because you're making everyone listen to your god awful static thanks to your shit phone and complete lack of interest in getting a ten dollar pair of headphones with a mic attached to them. Like. It's not a phone issue, dude. There are TONS of ways to mitigate this. Use push to talk, if you don't want to buy anything like a mic or headphones or *whatever*. I guarantee, even without the issues of recording while your mic is being obnoxious, the \"Usually can still hear and understand\" is a great indicator that they aren't 'small', quiet, or unobtrusive. If they prevent people - even if it's only a few people - from understanding you, they're fucking annoying. Try harder. Be better.", "You're an ass for telling your friend something he already knows is basically a one and a million thingm He is kind of an ass for kicking you out of the discord chat but static is really annoying", "Regardless whether your friend is an AH, please for the love of god get a new mic. \n\nEven a cheap mic like this works well enough:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/PoP-voice-Professional-Microphone-Omnidirectional/dp/B016C4ZG74/ref=mp_s_a_1_20?keywords=clip+on+mic&qid=1693971876&sr=8-20\n\nI used it along with my m50x headphones when I game and I've never had complains.", "NTA\n\nIt doesn't matter if the quality is bad. As long as the content you're looking for has the quality instead of the hardware shortcomings, that would be a great place to start.\n\nWhile I agree that static is an annoying thing, his response is incredibly shallow and mean. Thing is, COD Mobile has people whose mics are on, where you'll hear the most annoying and the loudest of background noise, but those are irrelevant when someone is engaged in the game.\n\nSo your friends are wrong, including your YouTuber. He doesn't realize most people would love to watch people play together and have fun, ignoring any issues with mics. I mean, look at TheDooo. There's a reason people watch the hell out of him.", "So your friends subs are just the 5 of you?", "Nta but leaning towards es h on this one, he can mute, but if you having voice was game (ignoring the yt stuff) critical I'd drop kick you too, mics are cheap", "ESH\n\nI was leaning towards NTA, but can't you use a headset or even headphones with a mic? Static audio while gaming would drive me insane, but I'm aware of the fact I'm more sensitive to this stuff than the average person.", "NTA but also, do you do anything to alleviate your static noises? As a lot of other people have said, it\u2019s extremely exhausting listening to static noises while trying to play with friends. \n\nDo you mute yourself and unmute to talk at all?", "NTA\n\nOh dear. Firstly who knows if he will be a famous You Tuber one day? It's possible. Many people have done it and everyone starts with one subscriber. It may take him years, but it's possible. \n\nNow the issue is him kicking you off gaming sessions that are supposed to be just for you guys to enjoy the time together, not specifically make content for his channel. I think he should either set up sessions just for recording for You Tube and not involve you guys as pieces of his content, or if he does, provide you with an adequate microphone since he IS using you as part of his content and isn't paying you for your time and work that's going into it.\n\nWithout content, he doesn't have a channel. If he's relying on you guys to BE the content, then providing a decent mic shouldn't be a big deal as an investment in his dream. It's not up to you to provide anything as you're not under contract, not getting paid and are just freely giving him your time and permission to use you all to help him out. \n\nIt's rude and wrong of him to suddenly decide you aren't just a friend but a free content provider for his channel and start punishing you for not providing him juicy free content with your time and energy. He should be paying you guys if he wants to use you.", "My job takes me to lots of different schools and one I was at recently had a display on the wall by children who had all written down what they want to do with their lives. The job that featured on there more than anything else: a professional YouTuber (seven kids). After that was professional footballer (three kids) and delivering pizzas (two kids).\n\nThe future looks bright, huh?\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your feelings were really hurt by his rude behavior. I\u2019m sorry that happened", "Well I think Max is being uncool kicking you off as you're supposed to be friends playing together, that's not how to handle things - you two were having a disagreement where each of you felt you could have been a better friend. But you went to another level in what you said - hurtful, mocking, condescending. How would you like to be told you'll never succeed in your own dreams?  ESH.", "NTA. he'd have a better chance winning the lottery than becoming a YouTube star. That realm is so oversaturated. Maybe back in 2013-2015. 2023??? No chance.", "my question is are you asking AITA for what part?\n\nare you the asshole for snapping at him because he kicks you because of the static noise? i would say it was a heated situation. both sides were high on emotions. ESH \n\nwhy? you knew his concerns and i m pretty sure he told you his concerns as you know the exact reason he kicked you. on the flipside he's an idiot, he could have just muted you or reduced your volume on his side.\n\nare you an asshole for telling him of about him being a successful youtuber? yes. this is the classic case of \"you're not wrong, but youre an asshole\". theres a high chance he might not make it. many people try hard and not make it. its not easy. but its not your place to pour water on his dream like that.\n\nsure it might be true, the chances of him succeeding is slim. but thats really harsh. he didnt ask for your criticism. on the flipside, can you imagine how HE feels? he puts effort into his streams ONLY has 5 subs. perhaps only gaining single or double digit views. can you imagine how disheartening it is to start streaming to see so few views? all your hard work and effort, day in and out. and barely anyone takes interest.\n\nthen you come down hammering him with statements that he doesnt want to hear. its akin to kicking someone while theyre down.\n\nyou're young 19. hes young too. calm ye tits down and make amends. tell him to just mute you from his side instead of kicking you outright.", "If you can afford a gaming habit you can afford a half decent mic.", "you could get a dollar 5 mic and the static is gone. ESH", "NTA you should pop that little dork in the mouth for calling you a bitch. Becoming a \u201cfamous youtuber\u201d is years past being feasible.", "NTA - you're gaming with your friends. your whole reason to be there on the game is to hang with friends. Max is putting priority on his YouTube channel, on entertainment value, on video quality, on building his brand - his entire focus is on himself, and his product. None of that has anything to do with his friends. He is using his friends for content building and has now clearly shown that he is willing to kick friends out if they do not meet his video quality standards. That is a prime example of him being a shit friend. \nI'm sure his 5 subscribers will cry so hard if his channel fails (one of which is probably his mom)", "He may upset his 5 subscribers, LOL and they are probably the same people he already games with.  You can\u2019t even monetize until you have at least 1000 subscribers, he seems to be deluding himself.  I\u2019d find new people to play with and maybe find a better friend", ">  They have SO many stories about their kids doing poorly in their classes because they need to \"get gud\" at X game so they can be YouTube Channel Super Stars!\n\nSounds like the nerd version of going all in on a sports career when very few are gonna make the big leagues and probably not you.", "I agree with the lofty dreams but the static issue doesn\u2019t just apply to gaming and people aren\u2019t realizing that. Yes it\u2019s what is mentioned here but it can be a bigger issue. If people are doing business meetings through Zoom it can cause screw ups if someone can\u2019t hear instructions because of static. Same with online learning or even long distance relationships. While it seems like such a non issue as kids gaming now can lead to a bad time later if not addressed now. \n\nNTA for playing games with friends but for your future look into getting it fixed sooner rather than later.", "I used to have an insta for my garbage mustache. 3k followers. Nta", "They would still endure the static, even though there are only 5 of them", "nah 20 is way too old to be acting the way Max is.", "If he really cared about YT as a career he would already be separating audio channels and filtering/editing during production so none of this would be an issue. The friend is half-assing it and excluding OP from their friends in the process.", "40? More like 15-20$.\n\nShes prolly the only girl in this group and the guys dont dare to say how crap her mic is.", "Got a 15$ mic that sounds better than mics from 100$ headsets. Yep op is the asshole.", "They also did it when it was relatively new and competition wasn't as stiff", "Thing is, it sounds like the friend is just starting out. Everyone starts somewhere and don't know how to do certain things, like what you said.", "Someone in my discord group kept getting muted by everyone else and he eventually got the hint. Changed his mic and people started to listen to him and not leave the channel en masse.", "I've posted exactly one YouTube video for doing a speed run and I still managed to do it. It's just laziness if you're not willing to do the research and put the effort in from the beginning, especially if audio is such a big deal to him that he's willing to exclude his friend.", "push to talk while using your phone as discord could be rather bothersome tho. a cheap mic will do the trick. hell mine is dollar 5 and no one ever complained.", "It\u2019s not minor. It really fucks with immersion and the game in general when there\u2019s constant static.", "Amidst all the downvotes, please, take my one upvote. It isn't much, but it is all I can spare", "Followed!", "Well that is you, not the friend. You did the research, but not everyone does it as they don't know the ins and outs of video making like you and various others do. I wouldn't say the friend is lazy, just doesn't know what he's doing yet and has a lot to learn.", "Thats what i was thinking. Im not a gamer but my husband is.  They all use push to talk moslty.  from what i gather.  Also and because im not a gamer or use dicord, But my husbands discord is on his PC.  why would someone use their fone and not discord on the PC?", "No workplace I know would require me to use my personal belongings,  I dunno how it is where you live but here employers are legally obliged to provide you with the means to do your job, if you regularly have to join zoom/teams calls, that includes a headset.", "I'm sorry man, but if he says that it's his dream job to do something that is almost exclusively video production maybe he should have done even the most basic research into video production before starting. To do otherwise is idiocy and setting yourself up for failure at the most crucial point. I thought I made it clear also that I don't know the ins and outs this was literally like click the first link on Google to do a single video type of information.", "If they're a console gamer, they might not be close enough to a PC.", "So what about people who do it professionally? Is that not labour? Or any professional athlete,  they're basically doing leisure activities all day, musicians?", "Not everyone starts with research believe it or not. I know I didn't, and maybe I would successful if I had when I was a lot younger. However, that is my hindsight. And my brother only recently started doing editing, which he's doing his best, but he got well over 300 subs before he did. And again, this is one of the many different ins and outs of video making. Learning different stuff in order to make the videos, and not to mention, you didn't make clear that it takes a single click, you only said basic research, which could be watching a bunch of different videos to learn how to make videos.", "That the friend hasn't done any research shows he's unlikely to succeed. Making a career out of yt is difficult as hell. Anyone with any concept of that difficulty would be doing research. He might think it's easy or that it won't require much effort. There are far too many people who want to make themselves famous or rich without putting in work.", "The friend probably hasn't gotten the grasp of the actual difficulty yet, and will definitely need to do the research in the future."]}
