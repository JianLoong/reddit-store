As someone working on building a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@Banished_Builds?si=qNLRk1fK3cVWCJx-) (not a gaming channel but gaming related) there's no reason to treat your friends like that, especially with such a small channel. At that small his biggest worries should be learning to edit better, learning to improve audio in editing software as best as possible, and finding out if his own personality can work for a gaming channel (judging by his behavior, no) because those are the core things you need when starting a YouTube gaming channel. Those are still important parts of any gaming channel.\n\nAlong with this, if he's worried about his friends' audio and it NEEDS to be better, he has two options. Either help you improve your current microphone's audio or buy you a new microphone himself. Hell, we pooled our money together and bought one of my best friends a gaming PC just so he could play on PC with us, and that wasn't for anything besides wanting him to be able to play a couple games with us.\n\nHis priorities are definitely misaligned between his friends and his YouTube channel. Now, this may be slightly different as I don't get to do things with my two best friends often, but I've missed entire days that I could be working or filming just to play video games or hang out with my two best friends. My YouTube does not come before my friendships. I'd like to think my YouTube has a better chance than the average normal gaming channel, but it should never and will never take priority over my friendships.

There's a huge difference there because the sessions were happening whether or not Max was recording them for content.", "Dude the thing here is that Max didn't ask their friends to be streamers, he just asked them to record their gaming sessions.\n\nAnd also as bad as the static is, if the content is good people will overcome a few seconds of annoyance, but if the content is basic and boring even the best audio can fix it.\n\nAlso lets be honest trying to be famous streaming discord calls where not everyone is involved sounds like a recipe for failure.", "You sound like one of the 5 followers this guy let down", "His comment got more than 70 upvotes. How about you keep your thoughts to yourself.", "<Max has entered the chat>", "What games are you playing on your phone? Could you not have just told him, \"nah, we don't want you to record because I'd like to be involved in the chat\"?", "Shes the toilet.\n\nBuy a mic. Stop being an annoyance to other people", "it\u2019s rather annoying that y\u2019all can\u2019t deal with the literal most minor inconvenience ever to play w your friends \nwild", "At least he's trying to make all that effort go somewhere.", "Not all of it, no. But he can definitely pitch in. Even without the YT uploads, having a shit mic is terrible and is your responsibility, not someone else's.", "Okay, you can\u2019t talk about a plushie avocado account without linking to it.", "You\u2019re not going to achieve anything with this mentality if you think 5 followers is nothing.\n\nWould you be surprised to hear that some of the biggest streamers and content creators also had 5 viewers at some point?\n\nQuite surprising, eh?", "Where are you working where your boss is responsible for fixing your mic? Have your ever even WFH? What does your boss do, does he come over to your house holding a Best Buy shopping bag with the intention to install it for you too?\n\nThese are basic life lessons in the modern world, the bare minimum is clean & clear audio/video. It sucks for OP if he can\u2019t afford it and I empathize, but it is what it is and I don\u2019t think this is something OP\u2019s friend should settle on if he really wants to make it big.", "One of our friends suggested that he doesn't record our sessions anymore but Max refused and says he 'needs' the content.\n\nWe play on console I just use my phone for the calling.", "but if OP\u2019s mic hasnt been a problem until Max started uploading youtube videos then clearly he\u2019s the only one that cares", "Having a shit mic isn't enough to kick a friend from a group of they're actually your friend. No one is obligated to pay for a friend's mic, but he's a total shlong to kick someone from the vc over static. \n\nIf he wants to record he can, but he shouldn't use his admin kick to maintain his \"YT persona\". \n\nDiscord has multiple channels to fix this. Hold to speak and changing settings to only pick up speech.", "Are you 12? If you're not, you must be trolling.\n40 bucks is a lot of money to spend on an unnecessary purchase. \n\nNo one cares about this dude's mic besides this Max guy, so he can either deal with it or buy him a new one.\n\nOP - NTA", "[deleted]", "My employer supplies laptops, monitors, microphones and speakers all for free. If they break - also replaced for free.", "Yeah I WFH 3 days a week, if my (company provided, together with my laptop, screen, mouse and kb) headset  breaks, my boss tells me to drop by the helpdesk and ask for a new one. I'm not gonna pay to be able to work for them, hell they pay anyone who is WFH a monthly allowance to replace your desk and chair every once in a while. OP's friend is profiting from free labor and should shut the fuck up before his friends realize it.", ">Where are you working where your boss is responsible for fixing your mic? Have your ever even WFH? What does your boss do, does he come over to your house holding a Best Buy shopping bag with the intention to install it for you too?\n\nNo, my boss didn't do that and now that I'm the boss I don't do that either.\n\nHowever, when I had issues and when my staff have issues with equipment that needs to be replaced then the appropriate equipment is requisitioned and supplied to the person having the issue. While I don't *personally* show up to install it the problem is solved.\n\nHowever, we aren't talking about an employer/employee relationship with OP. We're talking about a friend group playing video games. OP friend is not compensating his friends for their time, OP friend has not drawn up a contract that suggests that compensation will be incoming.\n\nOP friend needs to make a decision here about whether his career (that will likely never take off) is worth more than his friendships. Because alienating people generally just drives them away. If you want to talk about \"basic life lessons\" that is a key one. Don't burn your bridges.", "Do you not play with headset on console?\n\nJust download discord on there as it's available on both.", "Both Playstation and xbox have discord. Honestly having someone with a scuffed mic in discord is the most infurating thing in the world. You are making your mic issues everyone in the calls issue.", "There are external mics for phones. Or so I heard rumor. Let him provide you with one.", "Ah, okay. Again, I think ESH. You didn't have to shit all over his dreams, but yeah, he's being obnoxious. Is there a way to form your own chat so he can't kick you out?", "The only source of this info is OP. Not exactly the most trustworthy on this sub. I also agree they could go like 50/50 on it.", "Hard disagree. Had to kick people from my raid team because they refused to get better mics.", "I remeber I put off buying a new headset untill it fully broke. I was physically cringing at the prices, I still do. 40 bucks can be so much for some people and I can understand not wanting to spend that much if one doesn't have to.", "I'm sorry but I don't think 40 dollars is a lot of money. I also never said OP is the asshole.", "I really only wanted to respond to your first point because I find it funny in a sad way that you lead a pointless life with no outlook for the achievement of anything. \n\nBut regarding the rest, it\u2019s what the herd wants. If the majority of them agree like adults to create mature/professional quality content, what\u2019s the issue then? Who cares if discord danny started demanding it, what is the collective agreement and who is being the problematic outlier? This should address your remaining points thus freeing your conscience to reflect back on itself.\n\nedit: Controlling the scene and managing the audio/visual aspect of the content is not bullying. Stop talking out of your ass and projecting about something you have no idea about.", ">Not exactly the most trustworthy on this sub.\n\nThen who else are you meant to trust? If you can't take them at their word and need to invent other circumstances in your head, you're doing it wrong.\n\nMic wasn't an issue until Max wanted to monetize their friendship, should 100% be on Max.", "A raid team is not the same as a group of irl friends playing a game. I would have 0 problems yeeting a rando in WoW that keeps messing up, but I would never do that to a friend.", "Well there are people who, for them, 40 bucks is very much a lot of money, you shouldn't assume. If his mic wasn't a problem before Max's YouTube, and it's still only a problem for Max and his YouTube, then OP shouldn't waste a single dime.\n\nIt's friends time. They all agreed to be on video, but if Max can't shoot the video for any reason - the video is the one to go, not the friend.", "we get it you\u2019re spoiled dude, some people can\u2019t afford to just drop $40 on a new headset especially with the rising prices of groceries, rent and bills in general, and the insanely expensive medical bills that many many U.S. citizens struggle with (idk where OP resides). Shitty mic isn\u2019t that bad, $40 isn\u2019t \u201cnot that much\u201d.", "[deleted]", "Are these people irl friends or online friends? I mean, I've lead the same team since late Cataclysm, are they friends or still online randos?\n\nEdit: not that it matters, I was wrong here. Fuck I hate awful mics.", "It does not matter what the perception of worth is here. \n\nIf aspiring youtuber Max thinks the quality of his source material is   suboptimal he should 'invest'. The others in the channel already kindly provide him with free content.  It is not that hard to undersand is it?", "I suppose I can agree with that. I just really hate shitty mics as a raid leader, perhaps that blinded my judgement a bit.", "For someone who claims to be a senior chemical engineer with 7+ patents you spend a surprisingly odd amount of time on Reddit and especially in this sub-reddit. \n\nAny chance you\u2019re also good at offloading all your work to \u201cyour\u201d 40+ juniors?", "Ahhh so you\u2019re egotistical and felt a need to defend yourself to some random internet person. You have 40+ employees? Buddy you work for a mega-corp, those are not YOUR employees \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd in respect for your profession and line of work, I would never speak out of my ass about anything to do with chemical engineering.\n\nLikewise, I have been running my own business contracted with a FAANG with employees that I\u2019ve hired who directly report to me. And I\u2019ve been doing this since an age where I couldn\u2019t even legally sign a contract. Some of our verticals included content and digital asset management, so understanding what makes good content is something I learned right after I hit puberty\n\nedit: I\u2019m in a different part of the world every month, I stopped counting years ago. Just multiply 12 x 10 years with some overlapping countries and that\u2019s roughly around my number but I don\u2019t care to measure", "At that point they're friends, and I would tell them to use PTT or just server mute them, unless they have a super important role they don't need to be talking during fights. Certainly not worth kicking people over.", ">Any chance you\u2019re also good at offloading all your work to \u201cyour\u201d 40+ juniors?\n\nAh, you're just here to lie and troll.  Blocked."]}
