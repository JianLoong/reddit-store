There is nothing wrong with dressing your 14 month old boy in a feminine outfit because you think it'll be cute or it being an ode to an outfit you had. Where it becomes a problem is doing it to spite people who took issue with the previous outfit in this act of defiance. Your partner is right in being against it for that reason. Your kid doesn't need to be a statement on gender rights or whatever. Dress your kid up because you like it and it's cute, not to prove a point to people who were bothered by it last time. I bet if you never got that feedback, you probably wouldn't be as inclined to dress your son as a mermaid. \n\nDress and raise your kids how you and your partner want, not how you think you need to make a statement against other people who commented on his photo on the internet", "Yes. YTA. You're not dressing him up in that because he wants it, you're using your child to get a negative reaction from people.

You shouldn't be choosing his outfits/costumes just because it'll piss off some ignorant people. They are totally in the wrong for their bigoted views and for pushing those bigoted views on you and your kid. But that doesn't make it OK to use your kid as a prop.\n\nAlso, it's absolutely NOT a mom's job to embarrass her children. That's an incredibly fucked up, toxic view. If you keep up this view you're going to end up with a very distant relationship with your child. He's going to resent you and not want to spend time with you because he's going to see you as cruel. You may think embarrassing him is just a bit of light fun, but he's going to see it as cruelty coming from the person who is supposed to support him more than anyone else. I know because this is exactly how my own mom acted and by the time I was a teenager I never wanted to spend any time with her.\n\nWhat you should do is present the option to your child to dress as a mermaid or a pirate. Put both costumes (or pictures of both if you don't have them both) in front of him and let him choose. I have a 3 year old and a 15 month old myself. A child that young can pick for himself. If he chooses the mermaid costume, that's great. If he chooses the pirate costume, that's also great. Your job as his mother isn't to embarrass him or use him as a prop to piss off bigots.

Babies and toddlers used to only wear white dresses regardless of gender because it was easy to access the diaper and easy to bleach out stains.

Highly recommend!", "I think it'd be cool if you kept it with pirate colors! A merman with silver/red or black/red scales would look awesome. Fish on the shoulder maybe instead of a parrot? Or rather than a peg leg you could do a trident arm? Get creative with it!", "I think this option sounds good, your child is already old enough to choose between two options and is allowed to develop his own preferences.", "Completely forgot he was that young. Will honestly say while I completely agree it doesn't matter and either way NTA. Maybe get a pirate costume so they don't have to feel embarrassed potentially when they are older.

My boy is now four and has always loved cars and rainbows, and his hero is Rob Kearney (a gay strongman) as he has a brilliant rainbow Mohawk and lifts heavy weights.\n\nMy family don't care. As no one is mad enough to think you can 'turn' people gay.", "I get it. I fully endorse poking at annoying relatives getting bent out of shape over nothing, but I just don't think it's right to put a 14m in the middle of it.", "Except you specifically said you were doing it to cause a reaction....", "Yeah this is true. I wouldn\u2019t dress my child in opposite gender clothes, but that\u2019s just me. When they were old enough to decide, that\u2019s different, but I also wouldn\u2019t just use my child to piss off my family.", "I think you knew what you were doing", "The outfit is not the problem at all. The problem becomes the relationship with your family and your son's relationship with your family. I don't think you mean your baby any harm at all but I just would not use him to antagonize my family because you have to see them for a lot of holiday gatherings in the future.", "I don\u2019t understand people who cling to ignorance. With all the advances we\u2019ve made and all the correct information at our fingertips some people insist on hanging onto ideas born from bias, fear and downright hatred for anyone who looks, thinks or acts different.\n\nAsk your opinionated relatives if it\u2019s possible to \u201cturn\u201d someone gay by the clothes they wear, how come the reverse isn\u2019t true?\n\nAll the blue, hyper masculine outfits in the world never turned a gay man straight.\n\nSexuality is not a choice.

I think you can tell, but i'm all for abolishing gender norms/expectation and equality and shit, but i do realize we live in an existing culture and that culture will react to things that they find unacceptable. So, these things are prefectly acceptable to consider and to adjust your decisions based upon.\n\nfyi: it wasn't until the 1940's (-ish?) that they stopped dressing baby boys as girls until they started to walk/run around. And, about hte same time (i think) that the color pink was shifted from representing boys to representing girls.", "Omg I read 14 years! Ok if he\u2019s 14 months it doesn\u2019t fucking matter dress him as the mermaid and it\u2019ll be a good laugh when he\u2019s older. I hope your family realizes it\u2019s ridiculous to care because he\u2019s a tiny baby", "He is a boy though.", "He is a boy, not a girl.", "My thoughts is Merman outfit.  Like King Triton.", "How can a one year old kid know what he wants?", "Whatever he wants? He's fourteen months, he wants to crawl off of furniture and put the dog's tail in his mouth. I don't think putting him in a dress was a huge deal, but your reasoning is a little off. Why are you catering to the perceived whims of a baby?", "I agree that the ideas are outdated, but you aren't doing what a baby wants, this is what you want and that's totally fine as the parent.", "I normally lurk but felt to comment here: dress the kid up however you like, he's only 14mo old and really doesnt \"know what he wants\" except to eat/sleep/poop/play with toys. Without specifying my kids' ages or genders for anonymity, they all have had nail polish of all sorts of colors, dress up, etc\n\nBut to go on the mermaid/merman idea: I think it'd be an absolute hoot to see a little 14 month old kiddo with the merman outfit, a trident, and a grey beard + grey hair like King Triton from Disney's The Little Mermaid", "Yeah and she is dressing up the baby in order to cause a stir\u2026 great party behavior you dick", "Do all of you dress your kid up with the express purpose of pissing of everyone?", "I like the idea that because the pirates didn't write down who was hooking up with who some historians are like \"nah, didn't happen. No proof!\"", "It\u2019s never ok to weaponize your child. Put several costume options in front of your child,", "He\u2019s literally 1 year old.", "No but were off to the library this afternoon!

Pirates above and under the sea. \n\nWell done.", "I'm not sure it means that they are bigots, but even if they are, use kindness. Anytime we take an opportunity to prove a point that we believe in, we run the risk of someone else disagreeing. This is fine in the grown-up world but not so much for children.

If you dress him in it because he wants to wear it, fine but using your son to upset your relatives is not ok", "Gonna have to work on a costume for myself too!", "No sorry I didn't mean that, just i agree 100% with the statement but I wasn't trying to use my son to make it on any grand scale\n\nMy partner just doesn't want drama from people who will have a problem with it, he would happily dress him up in anything", "Also a good point dry structure, maybe to spite the relatives is wrong.
