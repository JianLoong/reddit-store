Me, my husband, Jess, and her husband Paul are all staying at our parents' house over the Xmas period.\n\nFor context, Paul arrived a day after the rest of us, very late at night because he does shift work and worked late before driving to our parents'.\n\nThe next morning, the girls were playing in Elena's room at about 10am. The adults were all downstairs, except Paul because he was sleeping, and my stepdad was out. Suddenly, we heard Paul shouting. This is not too unusual, if unpleasant, but this episode sounded particularly bad so we got up.\n\nBefore we can even get to the stairs my daughter runs down crying, saying Paul had shouted at her for waking him up. My husband was livid and went upstairs to deal with Paul while I calmed my daughter down. I knew it would be absolutely impossible for us to be around Paul after what happened so we would probably be leaving. Jess said that was ridiculous, Paul probably got annoyed and was tired and he'd apologise and everything would be fine. I said no, it would not be fine, nobody shouts at my child and remains on speaking terms with me or around my daughter, Paul should know better than to be acting like that with other people's children.\n\nWhen my stepdad came back, we told him what happened and that we would be leaving because we refused to subject Elena to being around Paul after what he did and we don't trust him not to overstep his boundaries like that again. My stepdad agreed, but said that it was unfair we should have to leave after Paul was the problem. He called Paul and Jess down and said they had to go, weren't welcome on Christmas, or until after we had gone home. Paul tried to defend himself saying the kids should have been quieter but when my husband got annoyed Paul half-heartedly apologised. I didn't believe a word of his apology. My stepdad reiterated that Jess was welcome to stay without Paul, but Paul had to be gone within the hour. Jess started crying and said it was unfair and that my stepdad was choosing me over her and was a horrible father. She started an expletive rant so I left the room with Elena, and the next I saw was her and Paul going upstairs to pack. They left without a goodbye.\n\nSince they've been gone every few hours I've got a text from Jess saying how I've ruined her Christmas and her relationship with her dad over 30 seconds of bad judgement. I don't think I created this situation because it was my stepdad's decision to throw them out, I offered to leave. I also think Paul made this bed that Jess is lying in. All he had to do was come downstairs and ask us to quiet the children, or pop his head into the room and ask politely. Nevertheless, I do feel bad that Jess is stuck in the middle and that Hattie won't see her grandparents on Christmas because of this. Did I overreact? Would Paul apologising have been enough?\n\nEDIT: Re the kids being unsupervised - I was upstairs with them, and we were all going down to do some baking. The girls asked for 10 more minutes to continue playing before coming down so I went down to get all the stuff ready in the kitchen, they weren't on their own for hours on end. They were playing with a large dollhouse in Elena's room, hence why they were not playing downstairs to start with.", "created_utc": 1671301410, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zocifh/aita_for_getting_my_stepsister_and_her_family/", "score": 191, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s an issue. If your BIL is shouting at his kid enough for it to be a normal thing there\u2019s something wrong there. She\u2019s 5, her dad shouting at her shouldn\u2019t be the norm. \n\nGood for you for standing up for your kid and your family. Paul has absolutely no business shouting at your daughter for playing.

Honestly, I\u2019d say that short of causing bodily harm to his daughter he should never be yelling at someone else\u2019s kid. \n\nYou didn\u2019t demand they get kicked out, you told your family that as a result of your BIL\u2019s inappropriate behavior you would leave so your daughter wasn\u2019t subjected to it anymore.

And judging from your post, \u201cThis is not too unusual, if unpleasant\u201d, I\u2019m assuming Paul screams a lot.

So dramatic and over the top.", "Esh\n\nYes, Paul shouldn't have yelled but you, the adults downstairs, should have made sure that the children aren't too loud and wake Paul.\n\nGoing all nuclear and dramatic isn't fair imo.

You suck for going off the handle and leaving without being an adult and having a convo with the other adults.", "ESH. Come on - I used to work nights - it totally sucked if people were loud. I bought earplugs and dealt with it. I wouldn\u2019t have screamed bloody murder at a 6 year old - but I wouldn\u2019t have been sugary sweet with them either. Keep the kids downstairs when someone is trying to sleep.", "NTA. Shouting at kids is abusive and not okay. You are not responsible for how your step-dad handled it. No one \"ruined\" anyone's Christmas; even the Grinch learned that other people's Christmas experiences were not his to control.

You made such a big deal of it and threatened to leave, ripping your niece and your sister away from their family because really, who is going to make their husband leave at Christmas and spend that time with people who obviously don't want them there? Your daughter should have been told by you that she needed to be quiet because her uncle was sleeping. \n\nPaul was wrong but yes, you created this situation.

I think we know who the golden child is.", "YTA- I don't agree with Paul yelling, but I hope your child grows up understanding that they will have many people disciplining them in life- family, teachers, coaches, and bosses. She also needs to understand that even adults make mistakes and need to apologize, instead of you jumping in to protect her while taking her cousin/ playmate from her on a holiday.", "NTA Like you said, it was your stepfather's decision to have them leave and uninvite them to the Christmas celebration. You even offered to leave, it's not like you told him to kick them out.

Also sounds like it's enabled (oh, he'll apologize).  Paul sounds like an AH for sure. You're a bit of an AH for not controlling the kids when you'd already said Paul was exhausted.  So, you got your butt on your shoulders for a situation you helped create with a guy you already knew has anger issues. And who was exhausted, to boot. Yeah, you're the biggest of all the AHs here.", "YTA, why weren't you supervising your very young child? You knew Paul was sleeping, you knew your kid was upstairs unsupervised, so she was bound to disturb his sleep. He maybe shouldn't have shouted but he was tired. \nI'd cut ties with you. You are a bad parent, a bad sister and were happy to have a tantrum and ruin Christmas for tour family.", "YTA. You blew up an understandable reaction to being woken up. True, he shouldn't have yelled and he should have apologized. \n\nHowever, your threat to leave Christmas if they don't was awful and unnecessary. You are not more important.

The guy worked late and you made no attempt to help keep the noise down.  Then, before he even had a chance to apologize you decided that it wouldn't be good enough anyway.  Then your dad agrees with you without even talking to the guy?!  And kicks him out!  Ya, both you and dad.  YTA.", "NTA. This adult woke up, walked into another room and shouted at a child that wasn't his. He had plenty of time to reflect on what he was doing and realize how it was going to go over.

Don't get me wrong, I completely disagree with Paul yelling and there must be some backstory here \"Suddenly, we heard Paul shouting. This is not too unusual\". But looks like you are projecting the backstory on this case, which is what we are judging.\n\nI find it overly dramatic to go nuclear and say \"we cannot share a roof over Christmas\". I've gotten called out as a kid because of being very noisy when a family member had worked overnight. That didn't traumatize me - rather, it made me concious of other people's sleep. \n\nLate shifts are hard and getting woken up by noises is a very stressing experience. It may easily lead to bad judgement. I would clearly expect an apology, not a complete drama and change of Xmas plans for 6 adults and 2 kids over this.", "NTA. Your kid got screamed at unnecessarily. You were uncomfortable and offered to leave. YOUR STEPDAD is the one who said \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have to leave, they should have to leave\u201d so I don\u2019t understand comments accusing you of making it \u201cus or them\u201d. Also, Jess and Hattie were welcome to stay. The adult who overreacted was the only adult who deserved to be penalized. Jess CHOSE to stick with him and take her daughter and leave. I\u2019d ditch my partner in a heartbeat if he screamed at someone else\u2019s kid. He could\u2019ve texted his wife and asked her to please quiet the girls or bring them downstairs. There were countless reasonable options. The only one who \u201cwent nuclear\u201d was Paul.", "NTA, largely. I can understand Paul's perspective to an extent, working night shift and then getting woken up is surely quite unpleasant. But that's no excuse for making a kid cry and then doing nothing to make it up to her. And the fact that this behavior is what he defaulted to when upset is definitely concerning. So while I think you and your stepfather did escalate this conflict a bit quicker than you had to, ultimately the blame lies on Paul.\n\nAll I can do is hope he doesn't act this way with his own daughter, but unfortunately there's a good chance he does. Hattie is not your responsibility but maybe you can look for more opportunities to connect with her just to let her know she has a support system outside her parents.", "NTA\n\nI get working nights and trying to sleep, but he has a kid, so he knows kids play during the day. It's his own damn fault for working at night. I feel sorry for his wife and kid, who are probably scared of him from the yelling I'm *sure* he's done. \n\nAlso, it's your parents house, and their say in who gets to stay. All you did is tell your stepdad what happened. He's the one that kicked the dude out. Not you.", "ESH - Paul was clearly an AH and as you\u2019ve stated\u2026you didn\u2019t make them leave\u2026.your stepfather did.

You and your stepsister families will never be able to celebrate the holidays together ever again\u2026all because Paul yelled at your daughter once when she was 6. Paul\u2019s apology to Elena should have been enough (assuming it was sincere)\u2026and you could have taught your daughter an important lesson about forgiveness.", "ESH\n\nPaul shouldn't have shouted like that and instead come to you or ask the kids politely.\nBut you shouldn't have threatened to leave immediately and instead be a little more emphatic towards Paul and the lack of sleep he probably has had.\nI understand that for people who don't wore late shifts or night shifts, 10 am is a reasonable time to be up. However, as someone who works nightshifts myself, I am still in the middle of my sleep at 10 am.\nAgain, it shouldn't justify Paul's yelling, but was it worth it to ruin Christmas over it? Paul probably was ready to apologize, but you stubbornly were deadset on either you leaving, or them.\nThink about how sad that is for your Elena and Hattie and for their grandparents.\nYou still had ways to make your statement, but still be civil towards your stepsister and Paul and celebrate Christmas together.\nPaul should apologize for his actions, because shouting at your kid like that is not okay, but you should've been the bigger person and either accept it or park it until after Christmas.", "NTA \nOnly because you said the shouting was not unusual.

Why did the situation happen, though? I\u2019ve seen your answer as to why the girls were upstairs alone.

Me, my husband, Jess, and her husband Paul are all staying at our parents' house over the Xmas period. \n\nFor context, Paul arrived a day after the rest of us, very late at night because he does shift work and worked late before driving to our parents'.\n\nThe next morning, the girls were playing in Elena's room at about 10am. The adults were all downstairs, except Paul because he was sleeping, and my stepdad was out. Suddenly, we heard Paul shouting. This is not too unusual, if unpleasant, but this episode sounded particularly bad so we got up.\n\nBefore we can even get to the stairs my daughter runs down crying, saying Paul had shouted at her for waking him up. My husband was livid and went upstairs to deal with Paul while I calmed my daughter down. I knew it would be absolutely impossible for us to be around Paul after what happened so we would probably be leaving. Jess said that was ridiculous, Paul probably got annoyed and was tired and he'd apologise and everything would be fine.

My stepdad agreed, but said that it was unfair we should have to leave after Paul was the problem. He called Paul and Jess down and said they had to go, weren't welcome on Christmas, or until after we had gone home. Paul tried to defend himself saying the kids should have been quieter but when my husband got annoyed Paul half-heartedly apologised. I didn't believe a word of his apology. My stepdad reiterated that Jess was welcome to stay without Paul, but Paul had to be gone within the hour. Jess started crying and said it was unfair and that my stepdad was choosing me over her and was a horrible father. She started an expletive rant so I left the room with Elena, and the next I saw was her and Paul going upstairs to pack. They left without a goodbye.\n\nSince they've been gone every few hours I've got a text from Jess saying how I've ruined her Christmas and her relationship with her dad over 30 seconds of bad judgement. I don't think I created this situation because it was my stepdad's decision to throw them out, I offered to leave. I also think Paul made this bed that Jess is lying in. All he had to do was come downstairs and ask us to quiet the children, or pop his head into the room and ask politely. Nevertheless, I do feel bad that Jess is stuck in the middle and that Hattie won't see her grandparents on Christmas because of this. Did I overreact?

People need to be considerate of each other.", "sorry I think my tone came off as challenging your judgement when I wasn\u2019t meaning to, was just pointing out that this isn\u2019t rare behaviour from him", "Nah. The first time you yell at my kid is the last time I see you. I don't need to babysit a grown mans temper problems", "Overreacting??? Do you have kids? If a grown up man started to yell at my daughter I would do something MUCH WORSE than what she did. She actually was quite calm, she decided to just leave.", "I still don't see why that's OPs responsibility tho. Like she shouldn't have to say \"you're not allowed to yell at my child\"", "Oh I agree she should\u2019ve talked to him and set a clear boundary before deciding to leave. I just don\u2019t think this was an isolated incident. I\u2019d be interested to hear if he had ever yelled at her daughter before, and how she responded.", "That sounds like a freak accident and an outlier. I grew up in a two story house and it\u2019s laughable to think kids wouldn\u2019t be allowed in a part of the house without an adult.  I\u2019m pretty much a helicopter mom but this is definitely not a universal rule and more of a you and your personal experience and trauma thing", "Same, I would go full crazy mama bear", "She stuck her head in the sand about something she knew was a problem and instead of addressing it decided to torpedo the holiday, either by leaving herself and by not insisting the stepdad not kick out the other family.\n\nShe\u2019s teaching her daughter and her niece how to deal with conflict, and in this specific situation did a terrible job. However, as previously stated I totally understand why she did what she did and commend her for her intentions.", "It\u2019s her responsibility to *teach her daughter* how to handle conflict. And she handled this one incorrectly imo.", "In a comment to me, she says she never discussed his behavior with him, but does not clarify if he\u2019d yelled at her daughter previously or her reaction to that.", "In California there's this law that allows insurance companies to cancel or not renew your house insurance if you file 2 house claims within 5 years. Even if you have two separate homes with the same company and separate claims they can still not renew both policies. And when you try to get a new policy with another insurance, your premium is triple the original amount of the original. I'd rather play it safe.", "She didn't discuss his behavior with him because he would just go nuclear and tell her not to tell him how to parent.", "She wouldn\u2019t be talking about his parenting, she would be talking about his behavior with her daughter. And besides that, OP says nothing to that affect in the OP."]}
