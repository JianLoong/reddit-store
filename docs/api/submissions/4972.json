Me, my husband, Jess, and her husband Paul are all staying at our parents' house over the Xmas period.\n\nFor context, Paul arrived a day after the rest of us, very late at night because he does shift work and worked late before driving to our parents'.\n\nThe next morning, the girls were playing in Elena's room at about 10am. The adults were all downstairs, except Paul because he was sleeping, and my stepdad was out. Suddenly, we heard Paul shouting. This is not too unusual, if unpleasant, but this episode sounded particularly bad so we got up.\n\nBefore we can even get to the stairs my daughter runs down crying, saying Paul had shouted at her for waking him up. My husband was livid and went upstairs to deal with Paul while I calmed my daughter down. I knew it would be absolutely impossible for us to be around Paul after what happened so we would probably be leaving. Jess said that was ridiculous, Paul probably got annoyed and was tired and he'd apologise and everything would be fine. I said no, it would not be fine, nobody shouts at my child and remains on speaking terms with me or around my daughter, Paul should know better than to be acting like that with other people's children.\n\nWhen my stepdad came back, we told him what happened and that we would be leaving because we refused to subject Elena to being around Paul after what he did and we don't trust him not to overstep his boundaries like that again. My stepdad agreed, but said that it was unfair we should have to leave after Paul was the problem. He called Paul and Jess down and said they had to go, weren't welcome on Christmas, or until after we had gone home. Paul tried to defend himself saying the kids should have been quieter but when my husband got annoyed Paul half-heartedly apologised. I didn't believe a word of his apology. My stepdad reiterated that Jess was welcome to stay without Paul, but Paul had to be gone within the hour. Jess started crying and said it was unfair and that my stepdad was choosing me over her and was a horrible father. She started an expletive rant so I left the room with Elena, and the next I saw was her and Paul going upstairs to pack. They left without a goodbye.\n\nSince they've been gone every few hours I've got a text from Jess saying how I've ruined her Christmas and her relationship with her dad over 30 seconds of bad judgement. I don't think I created this situation because it was my stepdad's decision to throw them out, I offered to leave. I also think Paul made this bed that Jess is lying in. All he had to do was come downstairs and ask us to quiet the children, or pop his head into the room and ask politely. Nevertheless, I do feel bad that Jess is stuck in the middle and that Hattie won't see her grandparents on Christmas because of this. Did I overreact? Would Paul apologising have been enough?\n\nEDIT: Re the kids being unsupervised - I was upstairs with them, and we were all going down to do some baking. The girls asked for 10 more minutes to continue playing before coming down so I went down to get all the stuff ready in the kitchen, they weren't on their own for hours on end. They were playing with a large dollhouse in Elena's room, hence why they were not playing downstairs to start with.\n\nEDIT 2: I don't think this will change the responses, but someone said this needed to be in the main post re Paul's history of yelling. Paul yells at his daughter Hattie quite a lot, in a way I would describe as quite vicious. We have all been made uncomfortable by Paul's outbursts, and more than once I've had to bite my tongue because I just think his conduct in unacceptable, but I do because he and Jess are the parents. Maybe I did overreact but imagining him shouting at my daughter the way I've seen him shout at his made me sick and angry.", "created_utc": 1671301410, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zocifh/aita_for_getting_my_stepsister_and_her_family/", "score": 775, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So, you got your butt on your shoulders for a situation you helped create with a guy you already knew has anger issues. And who was exhausted, to boot. Yeah, you're the biggest of all the AHs here.", "YTA, why weren't you supervising your very young child?

Don't get me wrong, I completely disagree with Paul yelling and there must be some backstory here \"Suddenly, we heard Paul shouting. This is not too unusual\". But looks like you are projecting the backstory on this case, which is what we are judging.\n\nI find it overly dramatic to go nuclear and say \"we cannot share a roof over Christmas\". I've gotten called out as a kid because of being very noisy when a family member had worked overnight. That didn't traumatize me - rather, it made me concious of other people's sleep. \n\nLate shifts are hard and getting woken up by noises is a very stressing experience.

Also, Jess and Hattie were welcome to stay. The adult who overreacted was the only adult who deserved to be penalized. Jess CHOSE to stick with him and take her daughter and leave. I\u2019d ditch my partner in a heartbeat if he screamed at someone else\u2019s kid. He could\u2019ve texted his wife and asked her to please quiet the girls or bring them downstairs. There were countless reasonable options. The only one who \u201cwent nuclear\u201d was Paul.", "NTA, largely. I can understand Paul's perspective to an extent, working night shift and then getting woken up is surely quite unpleasant. But that's no excuse for making a kid cry and then doing nothing to make it up to her. And the fact that this behavior is what he defaulted to when upset is definitely concerning. So while I think you and your stepfather did escalate this conflict a bit quicker than you had to, ultimately the blame lies on Paul.\n\nAll I can do is hope he doesn't act this way with his own daughter, but unfortunately there's a good chance he does. Hattie is not your responsibility but maybe you can look for more opportunities to connect with her just to let her know she has a support system outside her parents.", "NTA\n\nI get working nights and trying to sleep, but he has a kid, so he knows kids play during the day.

My stepdad reiterated that Jess was welcome to stay without Paul, but Paul had to be gone within the hour. Jess started crying and said it was unfair and that my stepdad was choosing me over her and was a horrible father. She started an expletive rant so I left the room with Elena, and the next I saw was her and Paul going upstairs to pack. They left without a goodbye.\n\nSince they've been gone every few hours I've got a text from Jess saying how I've ruined her Christmas and her relationship with her dad over 30 seconds of bad judgement. I don't think I created this situation because it was my stepdad's decision to throw them out, I offered to leave. I also think Paul made this bed that Jess is lying in. All he had to do was come downstairs and ask us to quiet the children, or pop his head into the room and ask politely.

Not an adult. That's when mom takes over and protects her cub from harm. Good on you op. NTA. You did not set the terms for Paul to go home but apparently everybody is sick of Paul and his yelling.", "Bullshit\nIt's NOT her responsibility to teach anyone that yelling is wrong, especially not a grown adult.", "This is how people end up stuck in abusive relationships. People teaching them to talk and work it out when they really should be removing themselves from the abuse", "If that were true, and you had learned how to effectively deal with this sort of person, you would know that engaging is the worse thing you can do; removing yourself from the situation is the only way to effectively deal with an event like this without escalating.", "I bet stepdad is pretty sick of the shouting too. Probably saw this as a way to both hand Paul a consequence for his behavior *and* not have to be around it for the rest of the visit.", "Screaming at a child for any situation other than an emergency is never ok. \"Girls remember I'm trying to sleep, be a little quieter and take your dolls downstairs now, thank you\" . He's the one who went ballistic and is reaping the consequences of his own actions, rightfully. I grew up being screamed at by my father regularly and it's traumatic", "Absolutely agree with you on this.", "It's not her job to teach a grown ass man, another parent, how to behave like a respectable adult.\n\nThis is Paul's fault. It sucks that Jess and Hattie left too. But it's on him.\n\nOP is NOT responsible for what happens when another grown adult does something he knows is not ok. Just because he gets away with it normally.", "So what? I don\u2019t get people second chances to verbally abuse my kid - why should OP?", "Yeah, I think the best thing to do would have been to set a firm boundary and give him one more shot before leaving, mostly for her niece\u2019s sake. That being said, if someone yelled at my kid I might\u2019ve got full torpedo as well.", "OP\u2019s husband wasn\u2019t asleep. Jess\u2019s husband was. If he needed quiet it was up to Jess to being *her own kid* downstairs, and up to Paul, or Jess, to tell OP to keep Elena quiet.  Neither did.", "Who expects someone to shout at your kid?  If it was expected, why would they have even gone?", "I don\u2019t think he should need a discussion about not shouting at children. It\u2019s better to set a firm boundary the first time something happens when it comes to protecting children rather than accepting something abusive even once so that the children learn how to set boundary\u2019s for themselves. Just because Paul is a family member, doesn\u2019t change the rules."]}
