Me, my husband, Jess, and her husband Paul are all staying at our parents' house over the Xmas period.\n\nFor context, Paul arrived a day after the rest of us, very late at night because he does shift work and worked late before driving to our parents'.\n\nThe next morning, the girls were playing in Elena's room at about 10am. The adults were all downstairs, except Paul because he was sleeping, and my stepdad was out. Suddenly, we heard Paul shouting. This is not too unusual, if unpleasant, but this episode sounded particularly bad so we got up.\n\nBefore we can even get to the stairs my daughter runs down crying, saying Paul had shouted at her for waking him up. My husband was livid and went upstairs to deal with Paul while I calmed my daughter down. I knew it would be absolutely impossible for us to be around Paul after what happened so we would probably be leaving. Jess said that was ridiculous, Paul probably got annoyed and was tired and he'd apologise and everything would be fine. I said no, it would not be fine, nobody shouts at my child and remains on speaking terms with me or around my daughter, Paul should know better than to be acting like that with other people's children.\n\nWhen my stepdad came back, we told him what happened and that we would be leaving because we refused to subject Elena to being around Paul after what he did and we don't trust him not to overstep his boundaries like that again. My stepdad agreed, but said that it was unfair we should have to leave after Paul was the problem. He called Paul and Jess down and said they had to go, weren't welcome on Christmas, or until after we had gone home. Paul tried to defend himself saying the kids should have been quieter but when my husband got annoyed Paul half-heartedly apologised. I didn't believe a word of his apology. My stepdad reiterated that Jess was welcome to stay without Paul, but Paul had to be gone within the hour. Jess started crying and said it was unfair and that my stepdad was choosing me over her and was a horrible father. She started an expletive rant so I left the room with Elena, and the next I saw was her and Paul going upstairs to pack. They left without a goodbye.\n\nSince they've been gone every few hours I've got a text from Jess saying how I've ruined her Christmas and her relationship with her dad over 30 seconds of bad judgement. I don't think I created this situation because it was my stepdad's decision to throw them out, I offered to leave. I also think Paul made this bed that Jess is lying in. All he had to do was come downstairs and ask us to quiet the children, or pop his head into the room and ask politely. Nevertheless, I do feel bad that Jess is stuck in the middle and that Hattie won't see her grandparents on Christmas because of this. Did I overreact? Would Paul apologising have been enough?\n\nEDIT: Re the kids being unsupervised - I was upstairs with them, and we were all going down to do some baking. The girls asked for 10 more minutes to continue playing before coming down so I went down to get all the stuff ready in the kitchen, they weren't on their own for hours on end. They were playing with a large dollhouse in Elena's room, hence why they were not playing downstairs to start with.\n\nEDIT 2: I don't think this will change the responses, but someone said this needed to be in the main post re Paul's history of yelling. Paul yells at his daughter Hattie quite a lot, in a way I would describe as quite vicious. We have all been made uncomfortable by Paul's outbursts, and more than once I've had to bite my tongue because I just think his conduct in unacceptable, but I do because he and Jess are the parents. Maybe I did overreact but imagining him shouting at my daughter the way I've seen him shout at his made me sick and angry.", "created_utc": 1671301410, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zocifh/aita_for_getting_my_stepsister_and_her_family/", "score": 5747, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've gotten called out as a kid because of being very noisy when a family member had worked overnight. That didn't traumatize me - rather, it made me concious of other people's sleep. \n\nLate shifts are hard and getting woken up by noises is a very stressing experience.

I\u2019d ditch my partner in a heartbeat if he screamed at someone else\u2019s kid. He could\u2019ve texted his wife and asked her to please quiet the girls or bring them downstairs.

I can understand Paul's perspective to an extent, working night shift and then getting woken up is surely quite unpleasant. But that's no excuse for making a kid cry and then doing nothing to make it up to her. And the fact that this behavior is what he defaulted to when upset is definitely concerning. So while I think you and your stepfather did escalate this conflict a bit quicker than you had to, ultimately the blame lies on Paul.\n\nAll I can do is hope he doesn't act this way with his own daughter, but unfortunately there's a good chance he does. Hattie is not your responsibility but maybe you can look for more opportunities to connect with her just to let her know she has a support system outside her parents.", "NTA\n\nI get working nights and trying to sleep, but he has a kid, so he knows kids play during the day.

This is not too unusual, if unpleasant, but this episode sounded particularly bad so we got up.\n\nBefore we can even get to the stairs my daughter runs down crying, saying Paul had shouted at her for waking him up. My husband was livid and went upstairs to deal with Paul while I calmed my daughter down. I knew it would be absolutely impossible for us to be around Paul after what happened so we would probably be leaving. Jess said that was ridiculous, Paul probably got annoyed and was tired and he'd apologise and everything would be fine.

My stepdad agreed, but said that it was unfair we should have to leave after Paul was the problem. He called Paul and Jess down and said they had to go, weren't welcome on Christmas, or until after we had gone home. Paul tried to defend himself saying the kids should have been quieter but when my husband got annoyed Paul half-heartedly apologised. I didn't believe a word of his apology. My stepdad reiterated that Jess was welcome to stay without Paul, but Paul had to be gone within the hour. Jess started crying and said it was unfair and that my stepdad was choosing me over her and was a horrible father. She started an expletive rant so I left the room with Elena, and the next I saw was her and Paul going upstairs to pack. They left without a goodbye.\n\nSince they've been gone every few hours I've got a text from Jess saying how I've ruined her Christmas and her relationship with her dad over 30 seconds of bad judgement. I don't think I created this situation because it was my stepdad's decision to throw them out, I offered to leave. I also think Paul made this bed that Jess is lying in. All he had to do was come downstairs and ask us to quiet the children, or pop his head into the room and ask politely. Nevertheless, I do feel bad that Jess is stuck in the middle and that Hattie won't see her grandparents on Christmas because of this. Did I overreact?

If it's been several times this person hurt her, there's maybe a deeper issue in it. If she feels it's not enough (she got hurt, she cried a lot), you can ask her what she wants, etc etc etc ... \n\nThe only thing that matters is to show your daughter she has the right to answer back when someone is mean to her, that she can stay where she is, she is legitimate and that it's the other who is at fault.

She needs to be able to put words on what's the problem, explain it and say she disagrees, until the point it's useless and she's loosing her time. \n\nBut don't worry Mama Bear, you're already doing a lot and she's very lucky to have you \\^\\^", "You...you think a grown adult needs to be gently reminded not to yell at children??", "I mean, ive been in houses echo-y enough that you could hear normal conversations from the other floorw depending on where you are (especially if near the stairwell/open areas", "I\u2019m going to make an assumption that you yell at other peoples kids.

It\u2019s interesting how so many people forgive Paul for his reaction but no one seems to excuse your reaction to having your child ripped a new one.

But that might also be because of the abusive marriage dynamic?  \n\nI suppose that could go either way.  Either Jess doesn't see what Paul does as abusive (i.e. she's fooling herself or lying to herself, for a variety of reasons), or she is afraid of him and all that is about trying to appease him (i.e. she knows if she and Hattie stayed, but Paul was kicked out, she and Hattie would pay for it later; the problem is, they will probably pay for it later either way).\n\nJess almost certainly needs a wake-up call. She may need support, too, in order to recognize her situation and get out of it, with her kid.\n\nThere's definitely a lot we don't know here, though. And it may not let the FIL off the hook.  Jess is the stepdad's actual daughter; he's stepdad to OP.  Yet, he chose OP and her family, over his bio daughter.  What's up with that?  I mean, yeah, on the surface, good for him for saying \"Paul is the problem, I'm sick of Paul's shit, Paul has to leave\".  But did he always not-approve of his daughter marrying Paul?

Unless she's planning to leave him immediately while staying at her parent's (which is unfortunately unlikely), she's going return to him eventually, and if she decided to stay without him he's going to be even more furious.

And you\u2019re not the one who forced him to leave, your stepdad did. It sounds like Paul and Jess have created a really unhealthy pattern for their family\u2026while that\u2019s unfortunate, it\u2019s not your problem.

I still VIVIDLY remember one occasion where I was at her house, somewhere between the ages of 5 and 8, and her dad was watching us and her little sister. He ended up screaming at us/me for something. It still makes me so uneasy when I think about it. My dad was not much of a yeller. To have a grown man screaming at me for some stupid childish crap was absolutely terrifying. I can still picture his face and like the veins in his neck. He absolutely still scares me to death and I\u2019m in my mid-30\u2019s and haven\u2019t seen him since my wedding in 2016. He\u2019s actually the reason she and I are no longer close. He yelled at me another time when we were teenagers because I had just gotten my license and we got lost trying to come back from Blockbuster. When she got in trouble for smoking and I found out from my mom that she\u2019d blamed it on me (I assume because she thought they\u2019d forgive me over the other friend it actually was, bc of our moms\u2019 relationship)\u2026I was terrified to ever go over there again. My mom believed me when I told her I\u2019d never smoked anything with her because of how terrified I was of her dad. \n\nSo\u2026tldr\u2026you\u2019re not wrong to draw a HARD boundary to protect your child.

Paul would be considered a \"high risk\" for escalation of negative behavior.", "I cannot say I agree about the foster home situation, as I'm not educated, but I can say in our personal experience cps is...useless. they really will only step up/in if it's considered severe (you're talking drug use in front of the child, sexual abuse, physical abuse). Doctors and therapists have called cps more times on my stepsons mother than years he's been alive (he's almost 10) for things like neglect, emotional abuse, psychological abuse and even locking him in his room at night without any means of escaping. They've done *nothing* but defend her. We were even told \"it's not ideal but she's the mother so we trust she knows best.\" My stepsons therapist is appalled but unsurprised. \n\nIt is unfortunate, and I make no mistake in saying there are tons of incredible people working for cps, trying their hardest, but overall it isn't this saving grace people say it is.", "Yep, exactly. OP said this guy yells at his daughter in a \u201cvicious\u201d way. She\u2019s heard him do it a LOT. This guy needs serious help, and I don\u2019t think children should be around him.\n\nETA: Fixed typo", "The system is flawed. The workers are burnt out. Too many cases, too much political bs. But it's sad that the kids suffer.", "Yeah; there are bad foster homes. Those are not the norm. Maybe those kids got bad ones. It\u2019s a shame that happened.  But you know so much about how bad those homes were when  you didn\u2019t put in a kinship placement that would take priority, right? i sure trust your judgment over mine when I\u2019ve seen 100s of times the number of cases.", "18 years, multiple kids, 1 good foster home. Uncounted bad foster homes. Yup, good ones are the norm.", "NTA I strongly suspect Grandpa has seen/heard enough of Paul's abusive shouting; this was Grandpa's opportunity to intervene and let his feelings be known.  Grandpa's boundaries were violated. Paul caused this family disruption, not you, OP. I think Grandpa did the right thing; an intervention apparently was needed.", "Being yelled at constantly is abuse. It warps your perception of safety and appropriate responses. That dad is abusing his daughter and I don't say it lightly but cps needs to be involved. I'm in therapy as an adult because my dad screamed at me over every little thing as a child and I now have a flinch reaction to loud noises and sudden touches.", "It\u2019s not the same. Still doesn\u2019t give OP the right to make her sisters family get expelled from christmas without as much as a talk", "Yes! So NTA! But if he screams at his family on a regular basis the sister probably knows that if they stay it will be even worse for them when they get home. She\u2019s right that their Christmas is ruined but it\u2019s definitely not OP\u2019s fault. I hope she will stop enabling and gets educated on emotional abuse.", "The people saying Y T A are comfortable enabling or enacting abuse, they\u2019re just telling on themselves.", "As someone who also works with CPS, while bad fosters aren\u2019t the norm, they absolutely do exsist. But more importantly, putting a kid in even a good foster is deeply traumatic, and needs to be weighed against the trauma in their home. \n\nGenerally though, I think that call should be left to CPS not someone looking in from outside. But people think \u201cput them in foster\u201d is an easy solution without thinking about how that act alone messes up a kid BEFORE you add abusive fosters (and also that due to funding there is an extreme shortage of fosters)\n\nThat said thank you so so so so so much for being a GAL.", "It's not a myth. It's the reality. Foster parents have had abuse claims made against them and still are allowed to continue fostering. The system is flawed. And you don't always go to a foster home. Group homes are as bad if not worse. After you're a certain age, group homes are the only option.", "NTA.\n\nFurthermore, to those that made comments about the children being \"unsupervised\"...really? Kids normally play on their own inside a house together. It's not like they were at a playground unsupervised. They were in a family home. What is wrong with you? Most of us in the world grew up without Mommy and Daddy right over our shoulder 24/7. If you did, you missed out on childhood, and had an abnormal childhood.", "No adult\u2019s first reaction should be to yell at a 6 yo CHILD! \n\nIf a grown man yells at my child for ANY reason, you better believe I\u2019m getting him away from my child asap", "I've woken up to my cousins screaming into their karaoke machine before\n\n\nI just get ready for the day and maybe tell them to quiet down politely, but Id never scream at literal 6 year olds", "100% and since Ive become a parent who was raised being screamed at and denigrated constantly, I have zero patience for anyone who doesn't try to do better with their own kids. Is it hard to break generational trauma? Yes. Is it essential to stop it for your own kids? Also yes.", "You are proving her point, you hear about the bad ones...", "I see you are also familiar with our good friend mr Bancroft", "I googled Bancroft and only found a tv show I never watched. This is so confusing lol", "I have an older sibling who is like this so I am familiar with this pattern as well.", "Ah, sorry! Lundy Bancroft wrote a book on domestic abuse called \u201cWhy Does He Do That\u201d, and in one chapter he details how, in a conversation with a client\u2019s wife, he asks her if her husband ever breaks any of his own things when he goes into his \u201cuncontrollable rages\u201d, which is how she realises that he absolutely does have control and he is deliberately choosing to damage her things to punish her. I assumed that was what you were referring to, my mistake! It\u2019s a good book though, well worth a read", "1000% !!! Pls take this award", "Ah I see! Well I must have gotten the example from someone who read the book because I was trying to make the same point. That Paul didn't want to yell at an adult (that he couldn't control through marriage) and that he probably waited until OP was gone to loose it. Much like in an \"uncontrollable rage\" the abuser would wait until they could find a thing the victim owned.", "Aww thank you. Don't really deserve it but I appreciate it", "\n>The world doesn't stop because you work a shift.\n\nand yet everyone who does work night shift is expected to tiptoe everywhere between 10pm and 8 am so as not to wake anyone up with a floorboard creaks. so very much the world does stop for you while you're claiming it doesn't... \n\nmaybe have some fucking empathy?", "Fair, but CPS in my state still recommends reporting this behavior if there\u2019s a pattern/it\u2019s chronic. OP says the guy yells at his daughter in a \u201cvicious\u201d way and that he does it a lot. I 100% believe his behavior is worse than OP has noticed because he is yelling at kids OUTSIDE of his home. Imagine what he\u2019s saying in his own home where he\u2019s most comfortable/most likely to yell.", "Speaking from experience:\n\nThe yelling and emotional abuse is the first level. It escalates to physical. If Paul is that comfortable screaming at someone else\u2019s kid as well as his own it\u2019s been going on for a long time with his own kid. And if his wife tolerates it at this time she tolerates it at home too. Someone (Jess? Grandpa?) needs to stand up to the bully to protect their daughter before it moves to physical.", "It's not ignorance. I'm not perpetuating a myth. Maybe your home isn't a bad one, but again you are the exception.", "I agree. There is a strange dichotomy at times between think the foster system cures the ills of those abusive situations while ignoring the inherent trauma that it inflicts by necessity vs those who just see the worst parts, that sometimes foster homes are abusive and neglectful too.", "I think it\u2019s a mix of people don\u2019t wanna admit parents can be as evil as they can and ALSO that they can\u2019t admit people who aren\u2019t evil can also be doing harmful things to a child. \n\nSomeday I hope we have a system where resources aren\u2019t so scarce.\n\nBut honestly, being a GAL is the most important part for doing as little damage to the child as possible. So many kids were so thankful for their GAL (and honestly most of them were unaware of the really important things y\u2019all do, they just were so relieved to have some JUST in their corner. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be in a finical place to be a foster but I hope someday to be a volunteer GAL/CASA"]}
