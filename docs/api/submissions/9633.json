I just prefer to be apart of it, not THE part of it. Partner could care less. So a small wedding was in the books. But I have a ton of siblings, who have kids, and he has a ton of family woth kids, and we both have remarried parents. Our small wedding was still going to be about 50 people. We were paying for it ourselves.\n\nMy mom can be extremely difficult and mean. So I had to choose a venue instead of having it at a family's house to keep drama out of the situation. That'd the cost go up as well.\n\nAfter a stressful couple of months of planning, my partner notices and says that this isn't how it's supposed to feel: getting married is a celebration of our love, and shouldn't depend on what family thinks. So we agreed we were going to just elope to France, backpack a few weeks, and use the money we would have spent on the wedding (our money).\n\nMost of the family was really happy for us. They insisted on gifting us some spending money, even after we said we didn't need it, and that it wasn't fair because they weren't invited. They gave us some anyways. \n\nWe had a great time! A blast, really. We back packed through countries, slept in hostels, rode the train. Got presents for everyone. I had a blog so they could keep track of us, even.\n\nBut now,  a few months later, my mom mentions that I \"pissed off a lot of people\" by eloping. That I made the family feel excluded. I know she is being mean,  and is most likely jealous I got to have this adventure. But I am second guessing myself. \n\nI know it's \"our life\" but I don't want to be seen as selfish or ungrateful for what they've given us.

That\u2019s what a wedding is supposed to be. \n\nCongrats!", "NTA.  By \"a lot of people,\" your mom means her.  You denied her an opportunity to stand in the spotlight and gush over her daughter's wedding, and her narcissism can't handle that.  I see how hard you're working to placate her and avoid drama, as evidenced by your attempt to find a venue despite a family's home being available.  I speak from over 50 years of experience with this when I tell you that nothing you do will ever do away with the drama.  She will always find something to be angry about. The hoops that you're jumping through to keep her happy are futile.  My mom is like this too, even at 79 years of age.  I feel really bad for you because I'm all too familiar with your situation.  I wish I had good advice to offer you to remedy the situation, but I've yet to find a solution despite spending over 50 years looking for one.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s ultimately up to you and your partner on how you want to tie the knot.

This marriage is about you and your spouse.", "NTA. This was your and your fiance's day. You did it the way you wanted. Maybe you could have a party now and invite everyone that would have came to your wedding, it might help smooth some feathers, if not, then so be it.", "NTA x100\n\n\"Mom, if people are pissed, I'll be happy to talk to them individually face to face.

Congratulations.", "NTA.\n\nYou said it yourself: your mom can be extremely difficult and mean. And this is a time where she is being difficult and mean. Your now-husband is right too: planning around the sensitivities of your family for a celebration about you guys and your love first and foremost is ass-backwards. Your wishes and your partner\u2019s come first in this arrangement, end of story. Your mom, and all the \u201cpeople pissed off\u201d, can cry about it!\n\nOn a side note, my sympathies are with you in navigating the bullshit around familial piety. I\u2019ve thought a lot about this topic recently because my cousin and her fianc\u00e9 are going to be doing the whole eloping thing too and not involving anyone at all, with either family, and not even telling anyone about when it\u2019s going to happen. My mom mentioned it before they came for Christmas this year that \u201cthey\u2019ll just figure it out as they go whenever they\u2019re ready\u201d, and then when my cousin and fianc\u00e9 came, and the topic came up, they said just to myself and the other cousins around her age that they had their date in May set and is not telling anyone else. And it all made sense; if this side of my family isn\u2019t completely deranged and unhinged, they can be judgemental. And his side are just busybodies all around.

When mom says you pissed of a lot of people, she means her. You denied her the time in the spotlight as mother of the bride. You did nothing wrong.

Congratulations", "NTA.\n\nYou were the one being married, not her. You are therefore the one that gets to decide which people you'll invite to your wedding, where you'll host it and whether you have one in the first place.\n\nI'm pretty sure that if you had actually pissed of many people by eloping, you wouldn't get offers to receive cash.

Even as a guy I've always fantasized about eloping like that, why get into a boatload of debt just as you're starting your marriage for a silly overly expensive party?

You do the same.", "NTA. \n\nAs someone with a narcissistic mother, who victimizes herself and manipulates everyone around her, this is something she would say. Almost verbatim. \n\nEVERYONE isn\u2019t mad you did this, she is. If everyone was mad, they\u2019d say something to you themselves. She\u2019s using the everyone wording to get a rise out of you. Maybe she\u2019s jealous, maybe she just needs someone to pick on today. Who knows. \n\nI say don\u2019t take it to heart.

Your partner and you did the right thing for yourselves.   Your mom was making the wedding terrible for you.

You avoided family drama (mostly) and avoided all the stress that wedding planning is and didn\u2019t get to experience the ugliness that seeps out of people during times like these. Your mother is legit jealous because: yes you are living a wonderful life and for some reason instead of being happy for you she\u2019s shitting on you. And the supposed family that are mad?

I give a hoot about anyone else seeing that (other family members) but if I\u2019m not there I would be devastated. \n\nBut I have a great relationship with my kids and would never try to force them to have a certain type of event if they don\u2019t want to so maybe that\u2019s why I truly don\u2019t ever see them ditching me out of their nuptials if they were to ever get married.", "NTA congratulations on your successful elopement", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No one asked your Mom to speak for them, and frankly, I wouldn't trust her perspective on this at all. You did nothing wrong, and had a meaningful, perfect wedding.  There is not a single person on earth who is \"Entitled\" to be at your wedding, you signed no contracts at birth guaranteeing a wedding at all. If anyone was 'pissed' (still highly doubtful) that's their own personal emotions and you have no control over it and no responsibility to micromanage it. The money that was gifted to you was done in happiness and love, with no expectations beyond that. Congrats and best wishes!", "NTA\n\nYour mom is projecting and refusing to just admit that it is she that is pissed off. I can tell that you are good people because even on your trip, you thought to get gifts for everyone who contributed to your trip. A lot of people would focus on being newlyweds; you thought of your 'community'.\n\nWe made the mistake of having a small wedding with family, and regret it. My wife's entire side complains about the location and trip and doesn't even think about it as 'our wedding'. You made the right call.", "You got your cake and ate it, too.\n\nCongrats\n\nIf others wanna celebrate, they're free to have a party, they can even invite you (and you can decline)\n\nNta", "NTA and I recommend never believing what your mom says about how other people feel. If you are genuinely worried, you can contact some relatives and say, I'm sorry you felt left out, we didn't mean to hurt your feelings. They will almost certainly tell you how happy they are for you.\n\nMy MIL did something very similar to my husband the night before our wedding. Pulled him aside to go off on him about how upset Aunt A (MIL's sister) was that we let other relatives from his dad's side pay for our rehearsal dinner (after they very generously reached out to us to offer) instead of asking Aunt A to pay. And that MIL's whole side of the family felt left out because the relatives from dad's side had given a lovely little toast welcoming all the guests at the dinner.\n\nHusband apologized profusely to Aunt A for the snub. Well you guessed it, she had no idea what he was talking about, was not upset at all, had not said anything about it to MIL (her sister), and found the whole idea a little ridiculous given that she had already covered a lot of the cost for MIL and other family members' travel to the wedding and felt like that was plenty of contribution from her.\n\nSo, especially around weddings, if people tell you they're happy for you, and someone who didn't get what they wanted says \"everyone\" feels the same as them... You've probably got one big happy family and one upset narcissist. But feel free to apologize if it'll make you feel better.", "NTA\n\nBut eloping can be seen as trying to distance yourself from the family so you might have some explaining to do if you don't want give people that impression.", "NTA.
