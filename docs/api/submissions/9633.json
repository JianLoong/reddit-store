I just prefer to be apart of it, not THE part of it. Partner could care less. So a small wedding was in the books. But I have a ton of siblings, who have kids, and he has a ton of family woth kids, and we both have remarried parents. Our small wedding was still going to be about 50 people. We were paying for it ourselves.\n\nMy mom can be extremely difficult and mean. So I had to choose a venue instead of having it at a family's house to keep drama out of the situation. That'd the cost go up as well.\n\nAfter a stressful couple of months of planning, my partner notices and says that this isn't how it's supposed to feel: getting married is a celebration of our love, and shouldn't depend on what family thinks. So we agreed we were going to just elope to France, backpack a few weeks, and use the money we would have spent on the wedding (our money).\n\nMost of the family was really happy for us. They insisted on gifting us some spending money, even after we said we didn't need it, and that it wasn't fair because they weren't invited. They gave us some anyways. \n\nWe had a great time! A blast, really. We back packed through countries, slept in hostels, rode the train. Got presents for everyone. I had a blog so they could keep track of us, even.\n\nBut now,  a few months later, my mom mentions that I \"pissed off a lot of people\" by eloping. That I made the family feel excluded. I know she is being mean,  and is most likely jealous I got to have this adventure. But I am second guessing myself. \n\nI know it's \"our life\" but I don't want to be seen as selfish or ungrateful for what they've given us.

You denied her an opportunity to stand in the spotlight and gush over her daughter's wedding, and her narcissism can't handle that.  I see how hard you're working to placate her and avoid drama, as evidenced by your attempt to find a venue despite a family's home being available.  I speak from over 50 years of experience with this when I tell you that nothing you do will ever do away with the drama.  She will always find something to be angry about. The hoops that you're jumping through to keep her happy are futile.  My mom is like this too, even at 79 years of age.  I feel really bad for you because I'm all too familiar with your situation.

Your wishes and your partner\u2019s come first in this arrangement, end of story. Your mom, and all the \u201cpeople pissed off\u201d, can cry about it!\n\nOn a side note, my sympathies are with you in navigating the bullshit around familial piety. I\u2019ve thought a lot about this topic recently because my cousin and her fianc\u00e9 are going to be doing the whole eloping thing too and not involving anyone at all, with either family, and not even telling anyone about when it\u2019s going to happen. My mom mentioned it before they came for Christmas this year that \u201cthey\u2019ll just figure it out as they go whenever they\u2019re ready\u201d, and then when my cousin and fianc\u00e9 came, and the topic came up, they said just to myself and the other cousins around her age that they had their date in May set and is not telling anyone else. And it all made sense; if this side of my family isn\u2019t completely deranged and unhinged, they can be judgemental. And his side are just busybodies all around.

You do the same.", "NTA. \n\nAs someone with a narcissistic mother, who victimizes herself and manipulates everyone around her, this is something she would say. Almost verbatim. \n\nEVERYONE isn\u2019t mad you did this, she is. If everyone was mad, they\u2019d say something to you themselves. She\u2019s using the everyone wording to get a rise out of you.

No one asked your Mom to speak for them, and frankly, I wouldn't trust her perspective on this at all. You did nothing wrong, and had a meaningful, perfect wedding.  There is not a single person on earth who is \"Entitled\" to be at your wedding, you signed no contracts at birth guaranteeing a wedding at all. If anyone was 'pissed' (still highly doubtful) that's their own personal emotions and you have no control over it and no responsibility to micromanage it. The money that was gifted to you was done in happiness and love, with no expectations beyond that. Congrats and best wishes!", "NTA\n\nYour mom is projecting and refusing to just admit that it is she that is pissed off. I can tell that you are good people because even on your trip, you thought to get gifts for everyone who contributed to your trip. A lot of people would focus on being newlyweds; you thought of your 'community'.\n\nWe made the mistake of having a small wedding with family, and regret it. My wife's entire side complains about the location and trip and doesn't even think about it as 'our wedding'. You made the right call.", "You got your cake and ate it, too.\n\nCongrats\n\nIf others wanna celebrate, they're free to have a party, they can even invite you (and you can decline)\n\nNta", "NTA and I recommend never believing what your mom says about how other people feel. If you are genuinely worried, you can contact some relatives and say, I'm sorry you felt left out, we didn't mean to hurt your feelings. They will almost certainly tell you how happy they are for you.\n\nMy MIL did something very similar to my husband the night before our wedding. Pulled him aside to go off on him about how upset Aunt A (MIL's sister) was that we let other relatives from his dad's side pay for our rehearsal dinner (after they very generously reached out to us to offer) instead of asking Aunt A to pay. And that MIL's whole side of the family felt left out because the relatives from dad's side had given a lovely little toast welcoming all the guests at the dinner.\n\nHusband apologized profusely to Aunt A for the snub. Well you guessed it, she had no idea what he was talking about, was not upset at all, had not said anything about it to MIL (her sister), and found the whole idea a little ridiculous given that she had already covered a lot of the cost for MIL and other family members' travel to the wedding and felt like that was plenty of contribution from her.\n\nSo, especially around weddings, if people tell you they're happy for you, and someone who didn't get what they wanted says \"everyone\" feels the same as them... You've probably got one big happy family and one upset narcissist. But feel free to apologize if it'll make you feel better.", "NTA\n\nBut eloping can be seen as trying to distance yourself from the family so you might have some explaining to do if you don't want give people that impression.", "NTA.

If they offered to give you spending money and supported your blog, they were more likely just bummed to not go to a fun wedding. But that\u2019s not a personal grudge. I wonder if your mom\u2019s been venting about the elopement and they\u2019re trying to remain polite; \u201cOh. Yeah. It\u2019s too bad. Sure! A wedding would have been nice, I guess.

If I remember right she wouldn't admit they got married for months and that was the only reason some people were upset\nIt sounds like your mom may think the world revolves around her. Your partner is absolutely right that you shouldn't be stressed about your wedding and it sounds like everyone except your mom supported your decision\nMy partner wanted to just do a courthouse wedding but I wanted to do the small unconventional wedding where I wore a crimson dress and my grandmother handfasted my partner and I. When my partner brought up to my mom that they had talked to me about doing a courthouse wedding my mom's only comment was that if we did have a courthouse wedding she still wanted to be there to see me get married", "By \"pissing a lot of people off,\" it translates into your mom being all BUTTHURT.\n\nThat is not your problem.

She may think she is seeing all the signs of people being pissed off (but of course, in her mind, they're too polite or uncomfortable to SAY anything to you, so she has to tell you because you really should know).\n\nI think that's often the case with my MIL, she thinks she has so much experience and reads people so well that she picks up on the signs, etc. The kind of person who needs to be the center of attention like this is likely a) pretty insecure and b) convinced that even once they're grown, their kids' behavior reflects on them, so they will \"notice\" lots of evidence that everyone is judging them and their kids, especially at big milestones.\n\nIt sounds like I'm making excuses for this behavior and I'm not! What I'm really trying to say is, of COURSE it gets under your skin because it is so convincing, the person saying it may believe it's factually true.

You do not have to have a wedding to please others. \n\nWhen my husband and I married 46 years ago, it was in the church, but it was just us, the couple that stood up for us and the minister. After the ceremony was over, our mothers came in to take some pictures.  My mother was fine with this arrangement. My MIL was not. She invited me to lunch at a local restaurant and brought her friend with, thinking that I would cave to the pressure if someone was with.  I told her that I wanted a small, private wedding and that would not happen if we invited anyone. My husband's aunt lived with his grandmother. If his grandmother came, his aunt would have to come. If his aunt on his dad's side came, his 3 aunts and their husbands on his mother's side would have to come. Then there was my family. My father was one of 9 children. My mother had 3 brothers. I couldn't have the small wedding if I invited the parents/grandparents/aunts/uncles, etc., so none of them were invited. We had a party the next weekend for friends and relatives.

If only to have the reception be an amazing shindig reuniting all of our friends. \n\nBut we are Disabled and don't often have the energy for big events so throwing one seemed daunting. Also our families are not the greatest. We knew if they ever mingled for longer than 20 minutes there would be issues. \n\nAnd there was the enormous cost. We would rather spend that on our house or a vacation or just save it for bills because the American healthcare system sucks. \n\nWe knew we were going to elope a few years beforehand and prepared our parents by saying that was our plan many times. \n\nA week before our 5th we told my bestie. She got ordained via Dudeism (she and I had yearly drunken Big Lebowski viewings). On our anniversary we went out with my bestie, her partner and her kids to our first date spot. It was the best time ever. She signed our documents after.\n\nMy mom and family were totally fine with it. TBH the only person to have an actual wedding and reception was my step sister. Everyone else elopes or courthouses it. My parents liked the idea so much they got married the same way a year later.\n\nMy in laws didn't say much beyond congrats and a cute sign commemorating the day. Until a year later.
