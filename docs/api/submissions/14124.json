My suggestion is to ask your dad to attend family therapy with you (no step mom currently). Maybe with a mediator, he can come to understand that you were a child who was treated as less than by his wife, so misbehaviour on your part stemmed from that. If anyone needs to apologise, it's step mom (a sincere one), then you might feel open to apologising for specific things (the name calling, etc). We can grow up and apologise for our own bad behaviour (seems you're on the path to that) but I think that comes a little further down the line in mending these relationships (dad recognising she mistreated you, stepmom working on herself and apologising to you).\n\nThe apology for her mom is separate, and you owe that to the woman personally, not to your stepmother.", "I know my dad well enough to never ask him to leave her or make her feel uncomfortable.

OP was bullied as a child for simple existing. TBH, we didn't get much context on the situation, but this may be borderline abuse if not abusive.

It may even help move the relationship with her forward.\n\nTbc. I'm in no way saying you need to accept her behaviour or even forgive it.

By the sounds of it, she's just jealous. You were his first wife's kid, not even his kid, and he took you in. She probably feels that since you aren't his, she didn't have to treat you nicely.

I've seen this happen both successfully and unsuccessfully. \n\nTbh, I wouldn't let her back into your life. And I'd be weary of him. Especially if/when you get married and/or have kids.

Nope I was very intelligent and had skipped a few grades so once she threw down the gauntlet I picked at every single one of her insecurities like a damn buzzard. \ud83d\ude43", "Nta, that women can't take accountability for her actions and has been blaming you since you were a child for their marital problems, even though you're not even around. Sorry you had to go through that op", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe her anything. It\u2019s just another one of her power plays", "NTA. But I would be up front with your dad and say the only apology you can sincerely offer is one where you say you are sorry you lost so much time with him because you reacted poorly to his wife's abuse. I'd also acknowledge that neither an insincere apology nor the only one that can honestly be given are likely to help things, particularly given that stepmom doesn't seem ready to acknowledge the reality that she was, in fact, abusive to you, but you'd certainly hear her out if she was ready to sincerely apologize for what she did.  If not, and you feel generous, you could offer to treat her like a polite stranger, so long as she does likewise, and hopefully that works for all of you. I would tell your dad if it doesn't, the best you can do is have a one on one relationship with him where you and stepmom never talk or cross paths at all.", "Fuck that. \n\nFrom your description, she sounds, at the very least, cold-hearted and entitled and, at the very worst, wantonly cruel.\n\nFrom your post, you have not a single thing to apologise for and, personally, this would be a hill I would die on.\n\nShe treated you dreadfully, she was openly and intentionally hostile, she demeaned you privately and in front of others, criticised your mother and rejected you and refused to accept you as part of the family. \n\nHow your reaction to this treatment can possibly warrant an apology from you is beyond the most fevered imagination.\n\nYour stepfather/dad was guilty by his neglect and absence both physically and emotionally. By supporting her treatment of you, he is every bit as guilty as if he'd done and said those things himself. It was his responsibility to protect you from the cruelty of his wife and he failed.\n\nObviously, I do not know a single thing about you but from the details in your post, this anonymous old bloke from the UK would be very disappointed if you ever spoke to the woman again, much less apologised.\n\nUltimately, you have to do whatever you feel is right to do for your own wellbeing. If you feel the rewards for apologising to your abuser are worth the humiliation, then you have to do it for your own sake. However, there is not a snowball's chance in hell that I would apologise to someone who had treated me like that. I would feel sullied and dirty.\n\nNTA NTA NTA NTA NTA ad infinitum NTA", "NTA. My step mum made my life hell when I was younger and it wrecked my relationship with my dad as well. He never stood up for me, never took my side, and generally just stood on the sidelines while she relentlessly bullied and harassed me. I'm sure I said some things I shouldn't have at some point, but I was a kid. You were a kid. It was never on us to be the grown ups in that relationship. You don't owe her an apology and you can still love your dad without apologising. This seems really manipulative on his part to make things go away without standing up and taking a side.", "NTA, your father is delusional and stepmom can fuck right off.", "NTA\n\nFrankly I wouldn't bother talking to your dad as long as his wife is in the picture. She's so toxic that you shouldn't have to ever deal with her again. He chose her over you and he got her. If he wants it the other way around there are plenty of divorce lawyers out there.", "NTA.\n\nAm I missing something?   Your stepmother was an adult who mistreared you, and your dad let her.     And now, after therapy, dad wants you to apologize to the step mother to re-establish relations?    Yeah, no, this would not work for me.", "NTA the fact they want you to apologise she's nothing has changed, she has not changed.", "NTA. The slippery slope every step-parent has to be on when it comes to \"their\" own children and possible steps to becoming a whole family is tricky. Your step-mom clearly has no want or need to have you around the family as much as your father and it's apparent everyone could see that. The apology is just the cherry on top of her pushing your boundaries with your (step)father and your relationship with him. To me, it sounds like he just wants to mend his relationship with her more than with you he just needs you to take more of the accountability than her or him, even though you were a child at the time. Low contact or no contact it's inevitably your choice how much of a relationship you want to have with your dad again. Never apologize for having feelings as a child that were shoved aside.", "*I will always love and appreciate everything you did for me growing up.  But your current wife is a toxic woman who wants absolutely nothing to do with me.  She has treated me horribly ever since the moment we met and you have never done a single thing to stop her.*\n\n*So unfortunately, as long as she is a part of your life, I can not be.  I wish things could be different.  But it is clear you are never going to hold her responsible for what she did to me and will always expect me to sweep everything under the rug because it's easier than her being held accountable.*\n\n*You made your choice.  You chose her.  Now it's time you learned to live with that decision.  Please do not contact me again.*\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nYou did nothing wrong. Why isn't he asking her to apologize to you given her poor treatment of you?", "You do not owe this awful woman an apology. She owes you one for treating you as she did. What a horrible, spiteful creature. You were a child and he was your dad. \n\nYou are allowed your own boundaries. Stepmother needs to be one of them. NTA.", "Your father is the asshole. If he really viewd you as a daughter he should have kicked her ass out immediately.", "NTA for either decision.\n\nThe decision is yours.  Talk to your therapist.", "NTA.   Don't apologize.  You apologize, and you'll confirm to him and her that she's right.  She's not.  You know it.  Stand your ground.", "NTA.  Basically he is repeating the same imposition on you he did when he married her.  Once again, the onus is on you to fix the situation in which his wife resents your existence.", "Spend time with SD if you want. Do not go near to her. If he brings her then leave.  NTA regardless what you decide.", "NTA. He's making your relationship conditional. That shows that he isn't willing to start anew.", "No. That is no way to restart your relationship and to expect you to do it to appease her is spineless of him. NTA", "NTA. Your step mom wanting an apology from you is hilarious. Tell your dad everything that woman said and did, and then tell him that you expect an apology from her instead. Tell him that your relationship with him is dependent on them both acknowledging the hurt they did to you.\n\nHer asking you to apologize is a power play. You do not owe her an apology, at all. To hell with her.", "This. OP, I would write your dad back, \"I'm interested in rebuilding a relationship with you, not X. X showed me over and over again that she didn't like me and didn't care about me. She took every opportunity to try to make it clear that I wasn't a part of your family. And you did nothing to defend me or try to make things better. I thought the focus of us rebuilding our relationship would be you and I discussing the past, making apologies as needed, finding some peace with it, and trying to start over. I hadn't realized that X wanted to be a part of this. Has her view suddenly changed? Is she waiting and eager to embrace me and treat me like an equal along with her children? Probably not. A tiger doesn't change its spots. If you and I work on our relationship, I can be polite to X. I'm assuming that's the most she can be to me. Unless, of course, you intend to have her apologize for everything she did to me. If so, I will write a list and send it to you, and we can start the apology train, which I think will ultimately lead to the same thing, X and I having, at most, a polite relationship. I think if we're going to try this, we need to be honest about that. Otherwise, we're wasting everyone's time.\"", "It's all very stupid and I admire you for having the patience to hear him out. He wants a quiet life. He's looking in the wrong direction at the source of his problems. \n\nNTA.", "If you apologize to her, she will just think she \u201cwon\u201d and revert back to her prior behavior. She wasn\u2019t even subtle about it last time, and she won\u2019t be subtle about it now. Can you not have a relationship with your dad only? Why does she need to be involved? Would she be apologizing to you, too, for how she horrifically treated you? The problem is that this is all one-way, and he is still making excuses for her and wanting you to sweep things under the rug. \n\nWhat has actually changed since you went no contact?", "Still, you only acted that way in response to her treatment. If you wish to still make amends for her mom despite the passing, you can apologize to her instead -but specify that it is specifically for that. \nInfo: what provoked the confrontation with the mom? Were you just being a teen with attitude or was she siding with her daughter? If the latter: was she fully aware of how you were being treated? If she was your stepmom\u2019s accomplice with full knowledge of what was going on, then I would say you\u2019re even clear on that.", "I hope you\u2019re in therapy to deal with this either way, it must be difficult.", "Honestly that whole last sentence is what I expected from our relationship in the first place so him asking for me to interact with her has completely confused me. She\u2019s ignored me for 15 years let her keep ignoring me!", "How does he recognize he needs to apologize but fails to realize that she is the other party who needs to?", "Has there been any pressure on HER to apologize to YOU? You were the one mistreated, thus she is the one who owes one. It needs no flowery explanation. Just tell your dad that. Cut your losses if nothing is expected from her. She was not and is not the victim here.\nNTA.", "This really doesn\u2019t seem like an apology for allowing his wife to treat you badly when you were a teenager. If he feels guilty for that, that\u2019s what he should apologize for. And if he feels guilty about it, he should recognize that it was his wife\u2019s (and his) fault. And if it wasn\u2019t the teenagers fault, the teenager shouldn\u2019t be asked to apologize. He is essentially continuing the same behavior that led to the rift while also saying he regrets the rift.", "That\u2019s honestly such a stupid reason I don\u2019t know how they can justify her abusing you and your father enabling her with that flimsy reasoning. \nWhy does he want a relationship with you after all this time when neither of them has changed one bit?\n\nYou\u2019re not the one that should apologise, but I hope you\u2019re in therapy to deal with this either way, it must be difficult. NTA.", "What's she like with your sibling? NTA anyway I'm just curious if her chip is towards anyone who reminds her of her husbands past or towards you specifically.", "I would ask your dad why he never loved you enough to deal with his awful wife.", "Okay I have to ask is Leave it Beaver a spelling mistake or a saying I know nothing about? Regardless I wish to adopt it into my vocabulary", "He clearly hasn't changed. The situation will not be any different than it was before and it's obvious. She's still going to try and shaft you at any opportunity, and he's still going to wring his hands and tell you to keep the peace. He did just that, actually, right here.\n\nHe thinks that making no real changes will be easier now that you're an adult & he doesn't have to make any \"real\" promises, or be beholden to any actual responsibility to you.", "I would just say \"I'm open to reconciling with you.  I will not apologize to her, and would prefer to not interact with her.  If the terms of reconciling with you include reconciling with her, I wish you the best in life, but I'm out\"", "Next time you talk to your dad to remind him that you have nothing to apologize for because you were a child. \n\nHe chose his wife over a child that he claimed to love, then abandoned that child because HE deemed that wife was more important than keeping a close relationship with the daughter he chose. \n\nHE ALLOWED his wife to bully a child for absolutely nothing, for perceived slights, instead of leaving her. He allowed her to bully a literal child. \n\nHe should have told her to get over herself as she was 30yrs old and was so upset that her husband wanted to be a father to his stepdaughter. So what. \n\nYou need to remind him that she is has been angry about you for fifteen years. \n\nThat you dont need to put anything aside until she apologizes for bullying you and pushing you out of her husband's life. \n\nRemind him that she had been trying to get rid of you, trying to separate you from your dad and show that you aren't his child. \n\nShe finally got what she wanted. You out of his life. So why is she so hung up on the fact that you didn't apologize, grovel and beg to have a relationship with your dad. \n\nShe got rid of you like she wanted. So why is she still so angry. \n\nHE CHOSE to neglect you and chose his wife over you. So he does not get to demand that you put your hurt aside to appease his wife and make her happy all because he doesn't want to listen to her complaints anymore. \n\nHe got his wife, at the expense of his relationship with you. \n\nHe might have gotten to keep his wife, but he's officially lost his daughter. He's never going to have a relationship with you as long as she's in his life and he doesn't sincerely apologize for what happened, instead of blaming you. \n\nHe needs to stop blaming you, and make it out that you need to be the bigger person. \n\nYou were a child. You did nothing wrong. \n\nSo keep reminding him you were a child.", "For the longest time she was perfect towards my sibling like my sister could do know wrong and the three of them (my sister, stepmom, and step sister) would even dress like triplets and I would be the one left out. I really resented my sister for a long time because she\u2019s naturally a bubbly extroverted peacemaker and I\u2019m her total opposite so I couldn\u2019t understand why she didn\u2019t take my side or atleast stick up for me. But just like I was a kid so was she and she\u2019s 3 years younger than me to top it off so I always felt like my stepmom won her over with toys and vacations. \n\nSome where along the way though the relationship between the two of them has soured as well. I feel like I\u2019m her late teens my sister really came into her own opinions and sense of what is right and wrong and she was LOUD about it. So then she became the target. She\u2019s opted out of a deep relationship with my step mom and has just maintained a surface level friendliness since. But she\u2019s better at it than me lol she still goes to their house for holidays and annual parties and manages to come out relatively unscathed. My sister overall is much closer to our mom and dad is trying to fix things with her too. \n\nWhen my sister stopped responding apparently she moved on to her own daughter \ud83e\udd74. I had no idea but apparently they didn\u2019t speak for 6 years because of my step moms behavior. They are speaking now I guess but it\u2019s very strained and she is much closer to my dad.", "[removed]", "She\u2019s the one who created the rift in their marriage by treating you unkindly.", "Whoops meant Leave it to Beaver as in the television show with the perfect nucleus family", "Precisely", "> she wanted my dad to use ***corporal punishment*** to discipline me\n\nAnd your father didn't break up/divorce her on the spot when she literally threatened to physically hurt you? What the actual fuck? I'd move on if I were you, I don't think you're going to get anything good out of a relationship with him if he's still trying to appease her after all this shit.", "Sounds to me like you were just a normal teenager and she was offended that you were there at all. She turned small conflicts into a contest between her and you for your dad's affection, and when she couldn't make him hit you for a minor offense took it as a personal insult.\n\nYou say she won, but he lost his daughter because of her nonsense and toxicity and while he enabled it, I'd bet he resents her for it. Doesn't sound like they're very happy together. \n\nIt's absolute nonsense that after putting you through all that as a kid he'll still ask you to apologize. He still wants you to show your belly to appease her. If he truly wants to repair his relationship with you, he needs to do better.", "If her ability to have a healthy relationship with her husband is being hindered by the fact that you once snatched a remote control out of her mother\u2019s hands 15 years ago, you are so very much not the problem here. This is such a tiny and petty thing to be holding a grudge about for such a long time.\n\nWill your dad be requiring her to apologize to you for mistreating you for so many years, or are you the only one who\u2019s expected to apologize?", "Seriously??? Re: the remote. I don\u2019t know how old you were at the time but even if you were old enough to know better, this incident does not justify her treatment of you."]}
