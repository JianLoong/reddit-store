My suggestion is to ask your dad to attend family therapy with you (no step mom currently). Maybe with a mediator, he can come to understand that you were a child who was treated as less than by his wife, so misbehaviour on your part stemmed from that. If anyone needs to apologise, it's step mom (a sincere one), then you might feel open to apologising for specific things (the name calling, etc). We can grow up and apologise for our own bad behaviour (seems you're on the path to that) but I think that comes a little further down the line in mending these relationships (dad recognising she mistreated you, stepmom working on herself and apologising to you).\n\nThe apology for her mom is separate, and you owe that to the woman personally, not to your stepmother.", "I know my dad well enough to never ask him to leave her or make her feel uncomfortable.

OP was bullied as a child for simple existing. TBH, we didn't get much context on the situation, but this may be borderline abuse if not abusive. Step parents who come in after the kids are grown need to realize the relationship between them and the older kids isn't gonna be all love, sunshine, and unicorns. They have to be nice and put in an effort w/o the interference of anyone, especially the bio parent(s).

It may even help move the relationship with her forward.\n\nTbc. I'm in no way saying you need to accept her behaviour or even forgive it. I think if she can truly apologise and no longer behave that way you coul move forward with a civil relationship, if that means you can have your dad around (if thats what you want). But there's a lot of work that needs to be done before that point.", "Ah, thank you for the extra info. I was definitely worried there may have been some abuse. By the sounds of it, she's just jealous. You were his first wife's kid, not even his kid, and he took you in. She probably feels that since you aren't his, she didn't have to treat you nicely. It was likely a power move. It seems she may have wanted to belittle you into behaving the way she wanted you to. I've seen this happen both successfully and unsuccessfully. \n\nTbh, I wouldn't let her back into your life. And I'd be weary of him. Especially if/when you get married and/or have kids.
