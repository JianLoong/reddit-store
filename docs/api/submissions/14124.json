My suggestion is to ask your dad to attend family therapy with you (no step mom currently). Maybe with a mediator, he can come to understand that you were a child who was treated as less than by his wife, so misbehaviour on your part stemmed from that. If anyone needs to apologise, it's step mom (a sincere one), then you might feel open to apologising for specific things (the name calling, etc). We can grow up and apologise for our own bad behaviour (seems you're on the path to that) but I think that comes a little further down the line in mending these relationships (dad recognising she mistreated you, stepmom working on herself and apologising to you).\n\nThe apology for her mom is separate, and you owe that to the woman personally, not to your stepmother.", "I know my dad well enough to never ask him to leave her or make her feel uncomfortable.

OP was bullied as a child for simple existing. TBH, we didn't get much context on the situation, but this may be borderline abuse if not abusive. Step parents who come in after the kids are grown need to realize the relationship between them and the older kids isn't gonna be all love, sunshine, and unicorns. They have to be nice and put in an effort w/o the interference of anyone, especially the bio parent(s).

It may even help move the relationship with her forward.\n\nTbc. I'm in no way saying you need to accept her behaviour or even forgive it. I think if she can truly apologise and no longer behave that way you coul move forward with a civil relationship, if that means you can have your dad around (if thats what you want).

By the sounds of it, she's just jealous. You were his first wife's kid, not even his kid, and he took you in. She probably feels that since you aren't his, she didn't have to treat you nicely. It was likely a power move. It seems she may have wanted to belittle you into behaving the way she wanted you to. I've seen this happen both successfully and unsuccessfully. \n\nTbh, I wouldn't let her back into your life. And I'd be weary of him. Especially if/when you get married and/or have kids.

But I would be up front with your dad and say the only apology you can sincerely offer is one where you say you are sorry you lost so much time with him because you reacted poorly to his wife's abuse. I'd also acknowledge that neither an insincere apology nor the only one that can honestly be given are likely to help things, particularly given that stepmom doesn't seem ready to acknowledge the reality that she was, in fact, abusive to you, but you'd certainly hear her out if she was ready to sincerely apologize for what she did.  If not, and you feel generous, you could offer to treat her like a polite stranger, so long as she does likewise, and hopefully that works for all of you. I would tell your dad if it doesn't, the best you can do is have a one on one relationship with him where you and stepmom never talk or cross paths at all.", "Fuck that. \n\nFrom your description, she sounds, at the very least, cold-hearted and entitled and, at the very worst, wantonly cruel.\n\nFrom your post, you have not a single thing to apologise for and, personally, this would be a hill I would die on.\n\nShe treated you dreadfully, she was openly and intentionally hostile, she demeaned you privately and in front of others, criticised your mother and rejected you and refused to accept you as part of the family. \n\nHow your reaction to this treatment can possibly warrant an apology from you is beyond the most fevered imagination.\n\nYour stepfather/dad was guilty by his neglect and absence both physically and emotionally. By supporting her treatment of you, he is every bit as guilty as if he'd done and said those things himself. It was his responsibility to protect you from the cruelty of his wife and he failed.\n\nObviously, I do not know a single thing about you but from the details in your post, this anonymous old bloke from the UK would be very disappointed if you ever spoke to the woman again, much less apologised.\n\nUltimately, you have to do whatever you feel is right to do for your own wellbeing. If you feel the rewards for apologising to your abuser are worth the humiliation, then you have to do it for your own sake.

The apology is just the cherry on top of her pushing your boundaries with your (step)father and your relationship with him. To me, it sounds like he just wants to mend his relationship with her more than with you he just needs you to take more of the accountability than her or him, even though you were a child at the time.

All the woman wanted to do was give her condolences she wasn\u2019t trying to make a scene or be conniving she didn\u2019t even speak to my dad she spoke to my grandpa, uncles and us kids. \n\nMy dad didn\u2019t even try to figure out why tf I would flip my shit in my grandmas burial day he just automatically took the stepmoms word that I threatened her mother as fact and that was that. I flew home the next day after crying myself to sleep and when my mom came to get me I let her know I wanted to meet my real dad because obviously my dad and stepmom were not trying to be parents to me anymore. My mom agreed but told me I had to woman up and tell my dad myself my decision. So I did our emails were the last contact we had for 5 years until I saw him at my sisters highschool graduation briefly. He thought my mom would eventually convince me to come back around and fall in line, she did not.", "My mom definitely wasn\u2019t in a place where she could stand toe to toe with my dad, his lawyers and his wife.

So my mom said ok but the next time my child calls me crying that\u2019s it, and when I called crying at my grandmas funeral that was it.", "So my grandmother had just passed like it was within a week it was sudden and unexpected. We opened her house for the repast. Her husband my grandfather had been refusing to even come to the home because he was absolutely inconsolable without his wife. When we were able to coax him home he refused to sleep in the bed without his wife so we had closed off her bedroom. After the repast my father and my uncles took my grandfather out for a drink. Idk where the step mom was but we were left with her mom. Why this woman did this bothers me to this day but I try to not speak ill of the dead. She went into my grandmothers room that not even her husband, children or grandchildren has been in her and laid across her bed and began to watch tv like the fucking Queen of Sheba and I lost my shit.

And she's still nagging your father over it?! This woman has no interest in relationships, she only wants obedience and control. Your obedience, your father's obedience, your sisters' obedience, nothing short of absolute groveling from everyone, and it won't be good enough for her.\n\nThe problem is, you're approaching this as if the woman is an emotional adult, she isn't. This screams personality disorder, and it's sad that your dad wants to waste his one life with a partner who will never think he's good enough. And now he wants to drag you back into that toxic nightmare?

Really seeing what you went through forces him to confront himself.\n\nYou can be honest with him, you have nothing to lose, \"Dad, I feel like you let her treat me like a second class citizen. I was just a kid, I was hurt. I am sorry I lashed out but you've given her actions, as an adult, far more grace than you are giving to a 14 year old child.

You are NTA but I wouldn't do any of that apologizing if I were you!", "NTA\n\nWhenever someone comes with the \"because you love me,\" just lob it right back at them. It's sad that his wife doesn't love him enough that he has to come begging scraps. Don't apologize. And frankly, this guy isn't worth it. You were fine  for 15 years without him, you'll be fine without him going forward.", "You reacted out of anger at her mother's disrespect for your grandmother and her room. This was an emotional time, and she expected corporal punishment for daring to get angry at their audacity? Now, she wants you to apologize to her when it was she who caused the problem? NTA and hell would freeze over before I could force the word \"sorry\" out of my mouth.", "Hell no! NTA your Dad is not the same man who raised you anymore. He has drank the koolaid. Sorry. Keep the memories.", "Nta and don\u2019t apologize if you don\u2019t want. You can have a relationship with him and not her. I read you comment about how she feels you are still a problem but you haven\u2019t even been there. She\u2019s crazy!", "NTA. You do NOT owe that woman an apology and your dad is trying to guilt you and paint a narrative that you were the one at fault. His actions here suggest that he has not changed at all, and will continue to prioritize her feelings over yours. Don't resume a relationship with someone this manipulative.", "But what exactly does he expect you to apologize for? Existing?\n\nNTA", "Mother in law should not have gone to lounge on her grandfather\u2019s marital bed that he was so distraught he couldn\u2019t sleep in without his recently deceased wife. Who goes and lies down on someone else\u2019s bed when they visit?", "Your dad's wife is definitely not someone you should apologize to. But from what I've read, your dad is much worse and I don't understand why you'd want a relationship at all with him.", "I like the idea of a new phrase just to confuse people. Like \"a tiger can't change its pants... because it doesn't have opposable thumbs,\" or something.", "Yea I wouldn\u2019t lay on anyone\u2019s bed on any day. Let alone while someone was in a state of mourning.", "Why isn\u2019t he asking his wife if she loves him enough to apologize for picking on a child?", "Could you detail this possibly? I think I may have a similar issue and it would be great to have a productive way to handle it.", "You should go to a therapy session with your dad. I think it would be eye opening for him.", "Your stepmother has been fuming for 15 years because she hasn't found a new scapegoat to take your place. Your father's life is miserable, and he wants you to suffer with him...", "op=NTA\n\nI think he needs more therapy.\n\nHe seems to have got the message that he gets to tell others what to do to make things HOW he wants them(Which is basically what he was doing 15 yrs ago)", "Sounds like to an extent she deserves an apology", "Did she apologize to you? Did he?\n\nWhy should you when you were the victim? \n\nYou have nothing to apologize for. This should be your hill to die on\n\nNTA", "She owes you an apology not the other way around. She caused this divide and if your father doesn\u2019t want to hold her totally responsible then I would accept the relationship with him as is where it is. NTA.", "First of all let me say, this is *highly* situational and subjective so this is just my advice.\n\nTo start therapy, you need it, you might need more of it. You have to figure out how you feel and what is triggering those feelings/interactions or you can't do the next step.\n\nNext, identify and create the boundaries of the relationship. For me it was two things, one was nitpicking for a fight and the other was the apologies that would lead to the \"but you\"s. My mother would start the conversation with what seemed like a genuine tear filled apology but as the conversation progressed it would turn into the \"but you\"s and make it a total non-apology in seconds. This was almost always about something that happened years/decades prior.\n\nWhat are you going to do to enforce those boundaries? \n\nI did this, grey rock (refuse to engage or acknowledge) or redirect by changing the subject which I would have to grey rock and leave if it didn't work. This coupled with going low contact (monthly phone contact mostly) is how I dealt with my mother until she recently passed. \n\nI am not saying it's the best way, you might have better results."]}
