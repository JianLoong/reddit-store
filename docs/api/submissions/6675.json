{"id": 6675, "submission_id": "10525kn", "title": "AITA for putting aside money for my godchild and not for another child in the family?", "selftext": "This story involves me (33f), my husband Max (32m), our godchild Elly (8f),my SIL (Elly\u2018s mother) Julia (38f) and Max\u2018/Julia\u2019s cousin Agnes (30sf)\n\nMy husband and I are childfree. However, we have a godchild, Elly. Since we both have rather high-paying jobs, we decided to set aside money for Elly for once she turned 18. It\u2018s not really a college fund, since education is mostly free in our country, but if she wants to travel, save up,etc. then that\u2018s what she can use the money for. Once she turns 18, the money is hers.\n\nWe have been putting money into that account basically since we knew SIL was pregnant, and if nothing goes wrong, in 10 years there will be over 120k$.\n\nElly\u2018s parents know about this & are by no means poor, but wouldn\u2018t be able to put aside this much money.While they assured us we aren\u2018t obligated to do so, they are very grateful.\n\nOn Wednesday I was invited to dinner at Julia\u2018s house (my husband had a work issue and couldn\u2018t come). She also invited her cousin Agnes, who was staying in town & I\u2018d never met before (apparently her family lives far away and they only saw each other sporadically as kids). We got introduced and all was fine, we ate dinner, and I helped Julia clean up. Agnes left the room to take a phonecall, and Julia told me about how sth she buys regularly got way more expensive and I jokingly said: \u201eIn this economy, I hope Elly\u2018s money will still be able to buy her anything when she\u2019s 18.\u201c Julia replied that she isn\u2018t worried about that and that Elly would be just as grateful for the fund as she is.\n\nAgnes apparently heard us, and asked: \u201eWhat fund are you talking about?\u201c when she came back. Julia just told her I have a fund for Elly for when she\u2018s 18. Agnes asked how much I\u2018m putting aside, and I didn\u2019t see the point in refusing to answer so I just said there is currently about 70k$. She said I should do it for her son too, and I was confused.\n\nHer reasoning was that her son is around Elly\u2018s age, and that since she is a single mum, she is in more need of help than Elly\u2018s family. I explained that I don\u2018t know her son while I see Elly at least 3 times a week, and she said that\u2018s no excuse, I replied I don\u2018t need an excuse to handle my money how I want. She said it\u2019s not her son\u2019s fault I don\u2019t know him. We argued some more back and forth, SIL seemed embarrassed and I left shortly after.\n\nI\u2018m only asking AITA because we have the financial ability to set aside more money for another child (though we couldn\u2018t match Elly\u2018s amount since there\u2018s already 70k there). The thing is, I don\u2018t really feel comfortable with it. Agnes and her son are strangers to me, and when SIL came over yesterday (and apologized for the situation) & we told my husband about Agnes\u2018 request his first reaction was literally: \u201eWho?\u201c and SIL had to tell him a story from when they were kids for him to remember who Agnes was.", "created_utc": 1673031189, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10525kn/aita_for_putting_aside_money_for_my_godchild_and/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Their financials, marital status etc is not your business. NTA and the nerve of Agnes!!!", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou have a specific relationship to the child you're saving money for, that of a God parent. Typically God parents will take over parenting a child in the event the parents can no longer do so.\n\nThis other lady is not directly related to you in any way it seems! She was quite rude to speak to you as she did, and she's just jealous, but thats not your problem.", "NTA - If you need to hear it - you owe that person absolutely nothing.  She was completely crass all the way around; from asking what you were talking about, asking for a specific amount and then insisting she somehow deserves the same treatment.

Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but Agnes is your SILs cousin? So she has literally no blood relation to you? And you and your husband have never met her/barely know her? And she wants 70k for her child who you have no relationship with? The audacity of some people really astounds me lol. Obviously NTA and Agnes is insane for really thinking she can demand money from you or your husband.", "NTA.\n\nSetting up a fund for a first cousin once removed (who you don't even know) is in no way comparable to doing so for your niece that you see several times a week. Agnes needs a reality check.", "NTA. Wow what an entitled B. I would have laughed in her face.", "NTA - if you weren\u2019t the godparent then sure I could see it, but that\u2019s insane someone would just ask you to set aside money for their kid like that lol wtf", "NTA - that\u2019s weird as hell that she asked you that. Way out of line. Move on from it and don\u2019t think about it again.", "Not my fault u dont know me.", "NTA\n\nYou are not obligated to spend money on someone you do not want to. It is your money and your affection. You can choose whomever you want to spend that. You are clearly not close to Agnes and guilt tripping you for your money is not at all justifiable.", "NTA\n\nAgnes can do one.", "NTA. You are under no obligation to set aside money for a child you do not know. It is your prerogative to decide how you want to handle your own finances and it is not fair for Agnes to expect you to set aside money for her child just because you are doing so for Elly. If Agnes wants to set aside money for her child, she can do so herself. You are not responsible for providing financial support to people you are not personally close to.", "OMG. You didn't even know her but suddenly you're supposed to set up a fund for her child??? What's to stop her from demanding you give it to HER rn for his sake (ofc) because she is a single mum (she told you so!) this is just unreal", "NTA - you have an active relationship with Elly and you are her godparents and this was your reasoning behind starting the fund for her. Your husband doesn't even remember Agnes nor have the two of you met her son. There is no reason to create a fund for him.", "Nta. Your money; you can do what you want with it", "NTA", "NTA.  You aren't obligated to give anyone your money.  If you two are able, it may be nice to save for a scholarship for a disadvantaged child to get help with housing or things when they turn 18 or sponsor someone who is disadvantaged, but that is entirely your choice.  I have money set aside for my kid, I wouldn't for someone else.  Even someone I know.  It is a huge struggle.", "Hahaha, nice try Agnes.\nNo, NTA.\nWhat an awkward situation.

She is very lucky. \n\nYou have no such relationship to Agnes or her son, they are strangers to you. Her only argument is that she is less well off than your goddaughter. Well, if you want to also direct some of your money towards helping youth or young adults who lack financial security, that would also be lovely. You could do that by giving money to Agnes, but honesty that goal would probably be better served by donating to organizations that serve that population.
