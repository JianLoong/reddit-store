Hes being one. It honestly sounds like he's doing this on purpose. I'd be cautious about manipulation tactics of you being a bad guy now. He might do that and he might use this to get Lydia to talk with other toxic family members.", "NTA. But it needs to be discussed now how you'll deal with her brother in the future. My FIL is never going to eat at my table again after I reached the end of my tolerance for his picky eating. He doesn't have a problem eating around or among food he doesn't like at restaurants, his sister's house or when MIL cooks... but he really goes hard at me for offering anything he doesn't like in a shared meal. Chili has tomato chunks? Brutal personal slight (no matter that there are other options for a main course for him.)\n\nI suspect that he has been told off and put in his place by his peers (wife and sister) but won't tolerate me not kowtowing to his whims as \"a child.\" He wants authority and control, to feel like he's in charge or being honored. Maybe your fiancee's brother feels the same.", "NTA- I legit had to go back and read Michael's age because I thought he was a toddler. He is 29 freaking years old and very disrespectful to his sister and you. He came into your home for Halloween and complained about everything. From brussel sprouts to carrots to mashed potatoes to raisins in cakes, seasoning on chicken and pumpkin soup being served. He is ungrateful. If I was invited somewhere and didn't like food I would still be polite and try some and not make my opinions vocal. \n\nThen for Thanksgiving he complains about menu being served and that you are not welcoming to him. Where does he get off? Also why is he not speaking to his sister about menu etc? If he doesn't like food he can stay home or bring his own damn food.\n\nAs much as your fiancee is upset about him not being there, he is a grown man and is acting like a toddler throwing a tantrum. A chef and baker are cooking dinner for him and he does nothing but complain.", "NTA - what is wrong with this guy?", "NTA. If you want to keep the peace you could tell him to suggest something he actually wants instead of him making you guess. But I don't think youre the asshole either way.", "Soft NTA. Instead of the menu, why not have them bring a dish or two to the event? That way, they\u2019ll be happy with whatever they bring if they don\u2019t like what you\u2019re having.", "NTA.\n\nHe sounds like my best friend\u2019s/housemate\u2019s brother. Total f-ing nightmare and only thinks of himself. I ignore 85% of what comes out of his mouth when he comes around on Christmas. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother sounds entitled and spoiled and completely unaware of the people around him. \n\nBut it does suck for your fianc\u00e9, so maybe invite him anyway and just put up with it; but that\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to decide together. \n\nIf he comes, I recommend turning on selective hearing, it really works wonders!", "NTA - Michael is\n\nBut maybe you can tell him that if he wants to come, he has to bring his own food for himself instead of uninviting him. That way he has only himself to blame if he doesn't like it.", "Questions-Was Lydia involved in the decision to not invite her brother? Were the complaints about the menu addressed to you and Lydia?", "NTA. I'm also VERY picky about what I eat due to medical issues, so if I'm invited for a meal where there's a good chance i won't be able to eat much, I eat beforeI go, and pick out what I can eat while there. Sometimes I just straight up tell the host, \"Listen, I'm ill atm, not to criticise your food but heads up I'm not going to be eating, but I love you and still want to spend time with you.\" People have always understood. Michael is just being an AH for the sake of it. Don't complain about free food, and if you don't like it, don't eat it and keep your mouth shut.", "NTA.  If he\u2019s the last family member she\u2019s in contact with, it\u2019s scary to think what the rest of them are like.", "NTA- you tried accommodating and he continued being a petulant child. If it\u2019s a huge thing he could bring food with him! I have dietary restrictions but I never assume my family should cater fully to it and always offer to bring sides or dishes to add that I can eat. BIL is being an entitled toddler.

That being said, he definitely seems to be behaving in a really unreasonable way. \nMaybe there can be a discussion on re-inviting him conditional on him bringing his steak and ketchup or whatever his picky heart desires.", "If I am reading this correctly: it's not enough for Michael that you provide foods he *will* eat and allow him to bring his own food if he doesn't like what is being served, but that he completely objects to the presence of foods he *won't* eat if you won't completely cater to his diet?\n\nIt seems like he is an extremely picky eater, you've attempted to cater for him in the past and he rejected it, so now you've told him to bring what he will eat so that he can eat with you. You aren't stopping him from eating and he's never been grateful for your attempts to feed him before. *There is no other option apart from making everyone eat his limited diet* and that is *not* a real option.\n\nNTA. You had me sold at him complaining about *mashed potatoes*. Who complains about having mashed potatoes at dinner? Even if you don't like mashed potato, surely there is an expectation of their presence?", ">he said that it was my job to make him feel welcome and I was failing to do so\n\nAnd it is his job to be someone that you want to welcome into your home, and he's failing to do so.\n\nNTA.", "He thought you were obligated to only make things he liked??  He\u2019s the asshole .", "NTA and also that sounds like the most fantastic autumn feast.", "NTA, no matter what his motivation was, he was being rude. If someone is a bad guest they don't get an invitation because you are not required to take that disrespect just because your fiance likes him. Or rather, that because your fiance doesn't want to completely get rid of every toxic individual she grew up with, so she's holding on to this toxic individual cuz at least he's not the worst one.\n\nI get the desire to hold on, but when people are assholes, you have to stop holding on.", "Let me start by saying that your fiancee's brother sounds like a colossal AH.  There is absolutely no excuse for his behavior. However, YTA for disinviting him, because he is your fiancee's guest, not yours. You could have told him you were not going to discuss this further and then had her deal with it. I get not wanting him there, but you took away your fiancee's choice, and that's a problem.", "NTA. Maybe Michael only eats chicken nuggets?", "NTA. Her family sucks.", "NTA", "Mmm. ESH. I think it should be Lydia who should be the one communicating with her brother. You\u2019re now in the middle and being made to look like the bad guy, here. Barring life threatening allergies which would require full accommodation, you should have a certain amount of accommodation for guests, yes, but Micheal\u2019s picky eating is not king of the event. It\u2019s up to Lydia, to tell him \u201cit\u2019s not all about your Micheal.\u201d", "ESH.\n\nHe was acting like a petty, unappreciative AH on Halloween. You invited him over, you didn\u2019t have to do that, and he started drama.\n\nAt the same time though, you probably should have consulted your fianc\u00e9e before you made the decision to uninvite them, especially considering they are some of the only family members she still talks to.", "Eh, I think maybe ESH. Thanksgiving is supposed to be a family holiday, so yea, you kinda are TA for uninviting him. That being said, he's a bigger AH for being so damned picky and whiney and seemingly refusing to compromise. I honestly hate to think of the example he's going to set for his kids. I understand everyone has different tastes, so if he doesn't like some of what you make, why don't you all collaborate? My in-laws suck st cooking entrees, so I don't let them anymore lol. Family dinners for us, I cook the entrees (always 2 because my wife has A LOT of food allergies), they make all the sides, and my wife makes the desserts (again 2 because of allergies).", "ESH. Michael sounds rather haughty. And you both have professions in cooking? Jeez, if Michael thinks he could do better, he should bring a dish himself.\n\nAt the same time, by uninviting him, now your fiancee won\u2019t have any family with her on Thanksgiving. That\u2019s sad. I feel sorry for her. Hopefully you can find a way to resolve the situation or make it up to her, cause that really puts a black cloud over a family holiday.", "We have the menu due to dietary restrictions and allergies of the other guests. We invite friends and neighbors who don't have family nearby to celebrate with. They were given the option to bring food for themselves, not other guests, if they don't like what we have but Michael said it's our job as the hosts to provide food and refused.", "1. Was Lydia involved in the decision to not invite her brother?\n\nShe was involved in both the conversation and the decision. I told her my plans to uninvite him before I did it and she said she's in support of my decision, but is still upset that it came to him not coming.\n\n2. Were the complaints about the menu addressed to you and Lydia?\n\nThe menu was sent in a group chat among me, Lydia, Jo, and Michael. Michael brought the complaints to the general chat and I responded because Lydia's response is usually either \"just don't eat it\" or \"McDonald's is open 24/7\" when someone complains about not liking something.", "I'll save you the mystery and say this much; \n\nLydia is trans and bi.

But I'd probably say something like Lydia would, lol.", "Sounds to me then you are doing all you should. I would let Lydia handle her brother, though."]}
