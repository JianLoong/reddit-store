It's not about *you*; it's about *her*. The intent may be the same, but the *method* is different. When you ask her what she wants to do or if she wants to do something, you're putting the impetus on her to make the decision and when she's feeling overwhelmed that's too much. By telling her what *you* have decided to do, but giving her the option to say no, it takes away the pressure of the decision. (The pressure is cause by anxiety over choosing incorrectly - it's not rational, since the consequences would be minor to nonexistent, but it is *real,* regardless.)\n\nShe's correct that you're not trying to understand why she's asking for things to be done a certain way.

Not saying you have to dance to my tune but at least try not to trigger me on purpose or do things contrary to what I have asked in the past.  My wife knows that when I go through my phase, she must leave me alone and she respects it.  I think some understanding goes a long way, but I do understand your frustration as well.", "Can the answer be yes to both? I have a lot of the same issues your wife mentioned, and my fiance often had similar reactions and logic that you laid out.\n\nI'm in therapy and with its help, I've managed to get a lot better for advocating for myself. But I guess where I'm confused is when I explained to my fiance many of the things your wife has explained to you, while we also had long conversations in which he was able to express his opinions (similar to yours), he also stepped up a lot and started taking that initiative. I can't imagine how much worse my life and mental health would be if I told my partner that I had issues with asking for help and feeling like a burden and his only response was \"just ask and I'll do it.\"\n\nMy fiance still says this all the time, but he also takes initiative and stakes our certain chores for himself, or even annoyingly asks multiple times and lays out the unspoken to make sure we're on the same page. E.x. hey, do you want some help with that? Okay, are you sure you don't want help or are you suffering silently and will be mad later because you don't want to ask me for help\n\nI don't even consider my fiance all that empathetic. But we both compromise and he does his best to help me because we love each other. She's overreacting because she's overwhelmed and healthy reactions don't seem to be something she normally has access to (though okay maybes that's just me projecting). But yeah, YTA too because if it's not working out, you can't just say \"well  she's being childish.\" Okay, so? Either you find something that works for both of you to help ease the mental load or things get worse.\n\nAnother example that I found really helpful is that I'm generally responsible for the groceries, but I have ADHD and anxiety and it can be difficult for me to remember all the things I need. So I put a whiteboard up on the fridge for the grocery list, and now my fiance instead of saying, \"hey next time you go to the store can you-\" he just puts the items on the list and anyone going to the store can take a quick pic and get what we need.", "YTA. I 100% completely understand where your wife is coming from.\nI have depression and anxiety, and when my brain is overwhelmed, I don't want more questions, I want my husband to take a bit of charge. Your wife doesn't need more added to her mental load. She needs support.", "I've had a similar conversation with my husband. He's just super considerate so he always asks my opinion first. I explained how that constantly put the mental burden on me.\n\n\"Do you want...\" - I have to think about wherever I want that and when the thing happens is because I wanted it. So if anything goes wrong, well i wanted it. \n\n\"Let's do X, cool with you? \" - this is my favorite. We're doing something together. It's us. My husband started doing this and at first if something went wrong he'd apologize profusely like if we picked a place for dinner and they screwed up our order. I told him it was our decision together and I could have stopped him so he shouldn't take the burden of responsibility alone. And also it doesn't matter, things are not always going to go right and that's ok because we're a team. \n\nNow we're in a good cadence where we neither feel burdened by the metal load alone because we share it as a team. \n\nWhen my husband changed the phrasing, he suddenly felt responsible for the action. He never did before because by asking \"Do you want...\" he was giving not only the decision making ability to me, but also the responsibility.\n\nMy husband was doing it to be considerate so the one time I explained to him about metal load and how it wore on me to constantly be the decision maker, he switched immediately. Because it wasn't a big deal, and he's an amazing husband. \n\nSo I believe you can too. Unless you're doing it to abdicate responsibility rather than being considerate in ethic case YTA.", "The phrasing example is enlightening. I will use it.\nYTA.

Get some help dude.", "> it relieves me of any extra stress by having her make most of the decisions and tell me what she wants\n\nok, so when YOUR stress is relieved that's a good thing, but relieving HER stress is a problem for you. got it.", "Even Alphas can have a hard time when dealing with mental health issues and it looks like she has a lot to deal with. It says a lot about how she is feeling when she is relinquishing a bit of control to you and maybe trust. That though can be scary and like you said stressful to someone who is not use to that. \nSo therapy and maybe a commentator who is in same kind of dynamic can add some insight because I am just winging this \ud83d\ude02. Good luck to the both of you.", "He said how he really feels in another comment. \n\n\"It relieves me of any extra stress by having her make most of the decisions and tell me what she wants so I can just comply with it.\"\n\nHe got really incel-y taking about dominant and submissive and she's the dom and he's the sub but not realizing that in dom/sub relationships, the sub has more power through the veto power. Also it doesn't sound like she wants this and she's begging him to take on more in their relationship. \n\nHe resents her for decision making and he wants her to do it because it makes her life easier LOL. Reminds me of the Barbie movie monologue .", "Maybe he needs to separate for a while and let her learn how to handle her issues. She\u2019s expecting him to fix her problems that\u2019s not fair. Why should he have to worry about making her mad? He\u2019s walking on eggshells. She doesn\u2019t care about him she only cares about herself and how everything affects her.", "I do not want to end the relationship. We love each other very much. I just think we are both adults and her demands feel child-like to me sometimes. I don't want to end up doing gentle parenting with her. If she feels like a burden, it's not because I ever made her feel that way and it's unfair to pin it on me and expect me to carefully choose my words so her brain can process this as being caring and loving.  I AM being caring and loving. If this doesn't matter to her or register unless is it's done HER WAY, I don't see how this is not unfair to me.", "Hello 0P\u2019s wife", "Yeah, but then she said she would have tried to power through anyway, regardless of me stepping in and taking the charge, so... what's the point really? Just to hear me say it?", "So you forget what she\u2019s asked of you, and then blame her for getting upset that you\u2019re not trying?", "Lol yeah Jesus man do you know what color her eyes and hair are? I don\u2019t want you to hurt yourself trying to remember cause you are not capable of actually caring about her.", "Sure, but I can let it slide when she doesn't do something the way I want it. I don't even bring it up to her. Why does she have to make a fuss about it when I can look the other way?", "You like strawberries.\nYou offer another person strawberries.\nThat person says \"no thank you, I am allergic to strawberries, but I love blueberries.\"\n\nYou continue to offer that person strawberries, they continue to refuse and then you clap yourself on the back for being a good guy offering to give strawberries, while at the same time being offended your strawberries are refused.\n\nStart giving your wife blueberries.", "> If she feels like a burden, it's not because I ever made her feel that way\n\nwho are you to decide how she should or shouldn't feel about something?\n\nalso, this from your comment above: \n\n>I think she should appreciate more that I'm willing to watch and learn\n\nbeing *willing* to do something & actually DOING IT are 2 different things. she's asking you to help her out by the way you phrase things, she's telling you why it makes a difference for her, but because YOU don't understand why it needs to be that way, you refuse to do it. WHY? if you want your wife to be happy, if you want her stress level to decrease, how does re-phrasing questions you put to her seem like such an impossible task to you?", "I agree with you this is not a relationship it\u2019s a dictator ship. You may love her but if this continues for a long time you\u2019re going to end up resenting her. She doesn\u2019t care about you she only cares about herself. That\u2019s not a relationship. Maybe a separation for a while we\u2019ll do some good but I highly doubt it she\u2019s not gonna change and this will be your life.", "Would be funnier if I was on a throwaway rather than a several year old account that makes it clear I'm not your wife, OP", "To hear the message communicated that you see her, you know her, you understand her, you care about her wellbeing. More specifically as someone who also has c-PTSD, we commonly steamroll our own wants and needs for other people's. It's like a preconscious instinct, it's not deliberate. We can find it really hard to even pinpoint what we do want or need in the moment, especially under stress, because of how ingrained that self-squashing instinct is during core developmental periods of our early life. If I say I have a headache my partner doesn't ask me if I want painkillers, she tells me to take them (and maybe fetches them), because she knows I'm hardwired to downplay my own pain because of how my past abuse worked. Most c-PTSD is from abusive relationships during childhood so lots of these are common patterns. Do you know if this is the case for your wife?", "Do you have trauma-related mental illness?", "She has history of sexual abuse as a child and has grown up in a house with an alcoholic and violent father and she says she's always had to be alert and vigilent and on the lookout for her and her mother.", "No.", "Can you understand how that vigilance on their behalf throughout a person's childhood would lead them to become someone who struggles with downplaying or even not noticing/processing their own wants and needs?", "There's your answer, my dude", "Yes, I do. But she's been in therapy for 3 years now and I don't see major progress when she's distressed. She instantly reverts to her default. She keeps telling me that it's a long process and that I need to have patience, but I want to see results. Maybe she's not trying hard enough.", "Jesus Christ dude how long do you think it typically takes to reverse an entire childhood of trauma? She will be dealing with this in some form for likely the rest of her life. It doesn't sound to me like you actually like her or care about her very much.", "I think you should show her the post and your responses to perfectly well critique of your behavior. She would most certainly rethink this relationship. I don't get why you would even ask if your TA in this. You seem unable to rethink your behavior and only to be on a hunt for validation. \nHer requests are reasonable and you are unnecessarily petty. Just take the L and be better.", "Well, she seemed to be doing better for a while, I don't understand how that progress can be undone so easily. She freaks out if she sees me having more drinks than usually. Afraid I'll turn into her father, feeling unsafe, etc. She needs to accept that what's in the past it's in the past, she's not a child, and not everyone is out to get her."]}
