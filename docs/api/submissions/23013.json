It's not about *you*; it's about *her*. The intent may be the same, but the *method* is different. When you ask her what she wants to do or if she wants to do something, you're putting the impetus on her to make the decision and when she's feeling overwhelmed that's too much. By telling her what *you* have decided to do, but giving her the option to say no, it takes away the pressure of the decision. (The pressure is cause by anxiety over choosing incorrectly - it's not rational, since the consequences would be minor to nonexistent, but it is *real,* regardless.)\n\nShe's correct that you're not trying to understand why she's asking for things to be done a certain way.

Not saying you have to dance to my tune but at least try not to trigger me on purpose or do things contrary to what I have asked in the past.  My wife knows that when I go through my phase, she must leave me alone and she respects it.  I think some understanding goes a long way, but I do understand your frustration as well.", "Can the answer be yes to both? I have a lot of the same issues your wife mentioned, and my fiance often had similar reactions and logic that you laid out.\n\nI'm in therapy and with its help, I've managed to get a lot better for advocating for myself. But I guess where I'm confused is when I explained to my fiance many of the things your wife has explained to you, while we also had long conversations in which he was able to express his opinions (similar to yours), he also stepped up a lot and started taking that initiative. I can't imagine how much worse my life and mental health would be if I told my partner that I had issues with asking for help and feeling like a burden and his only response was \"just ask and I'll do it.\"\n\nMy fiance still says this all the time, but he also takes initiative and stakes our certain chores for himself, or even annoyingly asks multiple times and lays out the unspoken to make sure we're on the same page. E.x. hey, do you want some help with that? Okay, are you sure you don't want help or are you suffering silently and will be mad later because you don't want to ask me for help\n\nI don't even consider my fiance all that empathetic. But we both compromise and he does his best to help me because we love each other. She's overreacting because she's overwhelmed and healthy reactions don't seem to be something she normally has access to (though okay maybes that's just me projecting). But yeah, YTA too because if it's not working out, you can't just say \"well  she's being childish.\" Okay, so? Either you find something that works for both of you to help ease the mental load or things get worse.\n\nAnother example that I found really helpful is that I'm generally responsible for the groceries, but I have ADHD and anxiety and it can be difficult for me to remember all the things I need. So I put a whiteboard up on the fridge for the grocery list, and now my fiance instead of saying, \"hey next time you go to the store can you-\" he just puts the items on the list and anyone going to the store can take a quick pic and get what we need.", "YTA. I 100% completely understand where your wife is coming from.\nI have depression and anxiety, and when my brain is overwhelmed, I don't want more questions, I want my husband to take a bit of charge. Your wife doesn't need more added to her mental load. She needs support.", "I've had a similar conversation with my husband. He's just super considerate so he always asks my opinion first. I explained how that constantly put the mental burden on me.\n\n\"Do you want...\" - I have to think about wherever I want that and when the thing happens is because I wanted it. So if anything goes wrong, well i wanted it. \n\n\"Let's do X, cool with you? \" - this is my favorite. We're doing something together. It's us. My husband started doing this and at first if something went wrong he'd apologize profusely like if we picked a place for dinner and they screwed up our order. I told him it was our decision together and I could have stopped him so he shouldn't take the burden of responsibility alone. And also it doesn't matter, things are not always going to go right and that's ok because we're a team. \n\nNow we're in a good cadence where we neither feel burdened by the metal load alone because we share it as a team. \n\nWhen my husband changed the phrasing, he suddenly felt responsible for the action. He never did before because by asking \"Do you want...\" he was giving not only the decision making ability to me, but also the responsibility.\n\nMy husband was doing it to be considerate so the one time I explained to him about metal load and how it wore on me to constantly be the decision maker, he switched immediately. Because it wasn't a big deal, and he's an amazing husband. \n\nSo I believe you can too. Unless you're doing it to abdicate responsibility rather than being considerate in ethic case YTA.", "The phrasing example is enlightening. I will use it.\nYTA.

Rather than keep asking me what I wanted to do or needed from home, he took charge of the situation. He realized I was staying for his benefit to my own detriment and started pulling me out of the crowd to the exit as quickly as possible. \n\nSometimes being a supportive partner is asking what your partner needs from you, but also, sometimes you just have to take charge of a situation they are struggling with.

It\u2019s not reasonable. It\u2019s not rational. And the emotional backlash that shows up from a trigger is so fast and so powerful that you can\u2019t use your rational brain to talk it down. There\u2019s no negotiating, it\u2019s just a vast sucking hole that opens up and pulls you away from actual reality and into whatever hell got stuck in your head.  The getting mad out of nowhere?

Not, \"I understand your frustration\"; rather a \"you don't deserve this. She needs to understand that mental issues do not excuse rudeness; and she shouldn't expect you to read her mind\".", "Thank you. I agree.", "Thank you for this detail, I think this is much clearer than what you put in the original post. It sounds like your wife is dealing with a lot and it's coming out in behavior that's genuinely difficult to handle for you. I don't think you ARE an AH, but I think you are letting your frustration make you ACT like an AH toward your wife sometimes, because instead of just telling her your own needs and boundaries and trying to find compromises, you are calling her demanding and saying her requests are nonsense.\n\nI've been through what I think is a similar situation with my husband, who has some issues with anxiety that he manages well now but that used to cause a lot of stress for both of us when I went places without him in the evening. If he texted me to ask how things were going and/or what time I'd be home, I often wouldn't get the text for whatever reason (didn't have my phone on my person because it doesn't fit in stupid tiny lady pockets and I set my bag down when I came in; had it silenced while watching a movie; who knows what else) and he would start to panic, picturing me dead on the side of the road.\n\nSo, after a number of occasions where he'd been upset with me for one version or another of this pattern playing out, one night after I got home he was telling me how scared he'd been and he said he needed me to always have my phone on me and check the screen every few minutes if it was silenced so that he could always reach me. I didn't tell him that's ridiculous, you're too controlling, etc. I said, I'm sorry you felt so scared but that's not going to work for me. It's important to me to be able to focus on conversation with my friends, and I would feel anxious and rude if I looked at my phone that much. I can agree to let you know if I'll be home later than I said I would, and I can share my location with you so you can see that I'm at the place I was going and not lying in a ditch. If there is something else you can think of that I can do to help, let me know and I'll see if it's something I'm comfortable with. Other than that, I really think this is something you might want to talk to your therapist about.\n\nI hope you find a way to have a version of that conversation with your wife. Think about which parts of what she's asking for work for you, and WHY the parts that don't, don't. Don't focus on judgements (that's ridiculous, that's not fair, you're demanding) but the specific effect her request would have on YOU. For example, \"it's hard for me to feel like you're my partner if I have to censor the way I phrase suggestions when I'm trying to help you. I can try to say things the way you prefer, but I can't promise to get it right all or even most of the time. I hope you can try to hear my meaning and how much I care about you, even if I don't say it the way you want me to. It might be worth talking to your therapist about how hard it is for you to tell me what you want.\"", "In this situation it feels a bit E S H (but YTA overall from the OP and your comments). \n\nFor this example, I'd never expect my OH to recognise when I was struggling and give me permission to stop. I'd usually ask for his opinion if I was worried about upsetting people and wanted to get reassurance. However, he does pick up on that stuff so often and its amazing and makes me so lucky to have him and feel like we're a partnership rather than 2 individuals. I do similar for him too, its not 1 way. My point is, noticing this stuff without 'mind reading' is part of a strong relationship and should be something for you both to aim for. You also, though, shouldn't blame each other for not realising it automatically. It takes time and commitment.\n\nOn your main question in the OP, what you are doing is completely different to what your wife is asking for. She's been clear with her needs and unless you're missing something out, it doesn't seem a lot of effort to give that to her. Recognising her needs and communicating them clearly is as important a part of managing ones mental health conditions as anything else. You appear to be minimising her needs and looking for validation of your own actions rather than focusing on how to work better as a couple.", "She also shouldn\u2019t expect him to just read her mind and know what to do or what she needs. Like just tell him!", "Yes, this is me too!! I have to be very clear on certain days on how I want my husband to handle conversations with me. I will clearly state exactly what I need and he abides on those really hard days. Some days, I just want to be left alone. He gives me my space. I cannot expect my husband to read my mind or figure out what I need, because one day what I need, is NOT what I need on the next day or when I am having a rough one. If he were to do the things that I need today on the other day, it would probably overwhelm me more, so he always ask and I always tell him. Some days its just give me a little bit. Other days it's would you mind starting me a bath? Some days its would you take care of all the kids and I am going to go for a walk? Some days I just want to lay with all of my kids and get loved on. Some days I am overstimulated and don't want my kids on me for a bit till I unwind.

If she is saying she needs you to take more initiative when she is struggling.  Then that is something you two need to sit down and discuss at a time she isn't struggling.  When she says she is feeling overwhelmed, asking her what she wants from you isn't going to help.  That just adds more to her mental load, and pushes her further into her struggle.  Something you could do is sit down and come up with a plan in advance.  This would need to be done at a time when she isn't struggling.  It could include pre-determined words of support and a check list for you to stay on track.  It could also include quiet time for your wife to check out a bit and decompress.  The point is to have a plan in place to be prepared, and for both of your roles to be defined in advance so there is no escalating the situation by not having someone take the lead.  \n\nShe needs to work on her emotional/mental dysregulation.  And that means taking a step back before arguments escalate.  She needs to have a plan in place to help her regulate and reset on her own.  And she needs to understand you can't just switch into support mode without resources and guidance as well.\n\nThe best example I can give is when Covid first took hold and we went into lock down.  My youngest was struggling really hard with switching from in person school to online.  So, we made a plan of action, set up his desk in my office, and took the first few days of digital learning to map out the schedule and his routines.  We emailed all of his teachers to ask clarifying questions and built out a routine for him.  It took so much of the anxiety away for him and he managed to get through the rest of the school year smoothly.  He had a plan he could follow, and I had ways I could support him.  When he transitioned into high school, we did something similar so he could adjust easier.  And now each year, he kind of builds a routine for each of his classes.  He asks his teachers clarifying questions, so he can create a routine that helps him function in those classes.

It sounds like she got overwhelmed and is taking it out in him because that's what everyone does on occasion when they're stressed out emotionally even without the added baggage of PTSD.  She should have been honest and then asked him for help on how to break away from the hike. It sounds like she wanted him to be the \"bad guy\" but how do you do that in this situation?

As a general rule, hikes and activities like that need to have somebody empowered to say \"So-and-so is not well. We're heading back\", whether 'we' is just that person and so-and-so or the entire group. \n\nAnd if somebody is physically ill, and dizzy, and taking way more breaks than everybody else... somebody on that hike should've stepped in and made that call.", "I think this makes a big difference in how you'd be judged if this was added.

So I got up, told the table we aren't eating here and asked the waiter to turn off the burner. \n\nIt's not rocket science that people don't actually want to do things that hurt them, but social pressures can keep a person from doing what's best themselves since they are thinking for the group. \n\nFor the people who are saying that she wants you as a crutch or puts mental labour on you, let her, cause you didn't actually do anything on that hike. Like why not just help her? It's baffling. It's suppose to be a partnership so stop acting like its a her vs. you. You're probably a big reason why she can't speak up, since even her own husband won't turn back with her.", "Why does she need to treat you like a child? With her trauma always wearing her down?", "Dude you genuinely suck. I hope she opens her eyes and leaves your rude ass.", "How would unilaterally deciding for her that they're going back not be controlling? What she should have done is told him she needed to go back and asked him to help her with communicating that with their friends. Not repeatedly tell him you don't want to leave and then punish him for not making you leave anyway. Imagine if he made a scene of trying to make her leave in front of everyone because he decided it's what she probably needed and he was wrong?", "Nice way to use the tired gender stereotypes to avoid a point.\n\nIt's also really common for women to insist their partner make all teh choices, too.   \n\nHaving to monitor her mood and mental state and constantly adjust language, while guessing does she mean \"x\" when she says \"X\"?\n\nThat is what walking on eggshells is.\n\nSure, he needs to help her, but it's on her to help herself deal with this stuff.", "Tbh, she is asking to make some decisions on his own and to use his head for once instead of always relying to her.\n\nN", "Dude, do you think she doesn't want results too? Do you think she wants to be impacted to this degree by her childhood trauma? I guarantee she also wants to get better, and you beating her up over her taking a long time is not helping. As someone else said, you are vile and incredibly selfish, and narrow-minded. You are, in all aspects of the word, an asshole.", "I feel very sad indeed that his poor wife has escaped horrible abuse, and has found herself in a relationship where the abuse continues in a different form. Why does he want to torture her? Awful excuse for a person."]}
