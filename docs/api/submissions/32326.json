You may end up being released eventually, but not until after the pills have been analyzed to find out what they are. And this will probably happen at each country you visit with those pills in your luggage. \n\nSecond comment - Have you checked to see what is in those pills and if they can legally be carried into ALL of the countries you will be visiting? \n\nThird comment - Why can't she send those thru the mail or even UPS or FedEx? Are they illegal to ship into that country? If she can't ship them then why does she want you to risk jail time to carry them?", "I will not be bringing any of these medications.

On the last leg of my trip, I will be in my home country. My mom asked if she can send with me some medications for my relatives. I said sure. She ends up buying 6 of those big 300 pill bottles from costco for me to send and it is so heavy and takes up more than half of my luggage. \n\nI have waited 6 months to go on this trip finally and to enjoy some time with my husband before I start a full time job and night/weekend school 100 miles away for 2 years. we will only see each other once or twice a month if that. My mom doesn't consider this at all. \n\nWhen I told her I will be cumbersome for me to take that much, I suggested she take some of the pills out of the bottles and pack them tightly in ziplock bags. She thinks that will make her look bad to my relatives and I said they need the labels. I said to take the label off of the bottle and put them along with the oackage or send a picture. My view is that they can get all the pills and that will reduce the weight and space the bottles will take. Now my mom is mad at me because she already promised 4+ relatives these pills. I havent even touch on the potential illegal trouble I can get in if these are discovered by TSA in other countries. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
