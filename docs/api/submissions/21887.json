Purchased the dresses and the shoes which was about $600 total. Told her we got everything and we were looking forward to it.\n\nA month goes by and I texted her and asked what outfit should I be looking for for my son (who was just a few months old). She said, \"oh, we forgot to tell you, no kids allowed. My fianc\u00e9's cousin's kids can't come so it won't be fair to them if your kids can go.\"\n\nWe were taken back. Like... uhh.. ok? My SO was not happy and neither was I. She offered to reimburse us for the outfits but we declined because my kids could wear them to somewhere nice.\n\nA little more time goes by and we get a text from Lucy saying only the older kids can go and we need to find a baby sitter. That was short notice. Her wedding was approaching fast and being in a new area where we didn't know or trust anyone made that tough. Looking for a baby sitter that would watch 4 kids was going to be expensive. We already shelled out the money for the outfits, gas to go to the wedding, hotel for the night and gas to come back would have been around $1K (not including babysitter).\n\nSO texted her, saying that we would not go because we can't afford all that, especially since we were just going to be guests and not part of the wedding party. I feel bad for not going but at the same time I don't because she took something away from my kids that they really looked forward too.

It was HIS wedding TOO and he had a right to decide things TOO.  She made it as fair as possible.\n\nI give her a Very minor SUCK for seeming to change mind about who can and cannot come multiple times(esp. with short notice).

You can be saddened by their absence, but actually getting upset with people, and refusing to communicate with them, *because they respected your wishes* is absolutely AH behavior. SIL is an AH; OP and her husband are not.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: It's very similar to having a destination wedding in a distant location that would require attendees to use up all their vacation time and money to attend. You can be saddened by the fact that some of the people you love won't be there, but you don't get to be upset or angry with them for it. If you make your event inaccessible to some people, you have to accept that those people won't be there. If you want them there, then you need to make your event accessible to them.", "That's a bit harsh dude. We don't know OPs exact financial situation or why they have that many kids.
