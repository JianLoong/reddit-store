She wanted ALL the girls to be her flower girls because she wanted them all to be involved.\n\nI was so excited and happy. Lucy texted me the links to the dresses and what shoes she wanted for her theme. Pretty pink dresses with baby pink converse. Pricey.. but it was fine. Purchased the dresses and the shoes which was about $600 total. Told her we got everything and we were looking forward to it.\n\nA month goes by and I texted her and asked what outfit should I be looking for for my son (who was just a few months old). She said, \"oh, we forgot to tell you, no kids allowed. My fianc\u00e9's cousin's kids can't come so it won't be fair to them if your kids can go.\"\n\nWe were taken back. Like... uhh.. ok? My SO was not happy and neither was I. She offered to reimburse us for the outfits but we declined because my kids could wear them to somewhere nice.\n\nA little more time goes by and we get a text from Lucy saying only the older kids can go and we need to find a baby sitter. That was short notice. Her wedding was approaching fast and being in a new area where we didn't know or trust anyone made that tough. Looking for a baby sitter that would watch 4 kids was going to be expensive. We already shelled out the money for the outfits, gas to go to the wedding, hotel for the night and gas to come back would have been around $1K (not including babysitter).\n\nSO texted her, saying that we would not go because we can't afford all that, especially since we were just going to be guests and not part of the wedding party. I feel bad for not going but at the same time I don't because she took something away from my kids that they really looked forward too. Plus, it turns out, she replaced the \"flower girl\" position to \"flower grandmas\".\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit to add: SIL and her side of the family has not talked to us, responded to us via call/text despite our efforts.  \n\n\nEdit 2: The cost of the outfits hasnt been held over her at all. The outfits were worn to other places.", "created_utc": 1689018986, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14w4f2u/aita_for_not_going_to_my_sils_wedding_after_she/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your SIL is a massive AH for one simple reason - the girls were asked to be in the wedding and then were dumped.  That's cruel to get their hopes up like that.", "NTA.  People are so stupid with this whole no-kids-allowed.  You're allowed to make exceptions for close children such as nieces/nephews, and it doesn't mean that your fourth cousin also gets to bring her kids too.", "ESH   Not AH for not going(invitation is not a summons yadda yadda)\n\nbut AH for getting knickers in knot over Flower grandmas(I think that is a lovely idea).\n\nAlso she offered to reimburse you for the outfits, so she did her best to compensate for the choices she had to make to meet her fianc\u00e9's input on the wedding.  It was HIS wedding TOO and he had a right to decide things TOO.  She made it as fair as possible.\n\nI give her a Very minor SUCK for seeming to change mind about who can and cannot come multiple times(esp. with short notice). And she gets suck for the no talking cr\\*p(Everyone needs to grow the f\\*ck up).

OP is allowed to decline. At this point no one's really in the wrong.\n\n SIL ventures into ah territory with the constant changes, kids are in, kids are out, wait some kids are in, you're not really giving them any chance to plan. \n\nSIL has every right to have a child free wedding as long as she accepts that not everyone can attend, especially with the constant changes, she became an ah when she was upset OP didn't go.  \n\nIf I was OP with all the back and forth I would've been worried that I show up to the venue with the older kids and SIL is all \"what are they doing here?\"", "Yeah, that tipped it for me too.

Im not counting the money for the outfits against her. My kids were able to wear them other places, so we did get our monies worth.   \nYoure right though, it was her wedding. Which is why we didnt make a stink about it. But for them to cut contact sucks.", "I respect your opinion. At the time we could afford the outfits but the last minute baby sitter is something we just couldn't afford and didn't have the money at the time to pay someone to watch them.

It did not seem malicious or targeted at OP. \n\nSIL\u2019s behaviour definitely was edging AH behaviour, but I didn\u2019t get the feeling that she actually crossed the line. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Understandable.
