I go to the pool at least 4 times a week, sometimes even more. I have been doing this since I was a kid. My kids don't like swimming much, occasionally like once a month they will join me however my 14yo loves swimming as much as I do. She has been coming to the pool with me for 5 years now.\n\nRecently my wife told me that the rest of our kids feel like I pay more attention to 14yo and spend more time with her. I told her that they are all welocme to join us then. She said that this is not how it works, I should be the one trying the kids hobbies not the other way around.\n\nI spend 1:1 time with all my kids every week, trying their hobbies. I should be allowed to do my own hobby as well she told me that I have been spending about 1 hour a week doing 1:1 activities with each kid however I spend about 9-10 hours a week with 14.\n\nshe thinks I'm an asshole for making the kids feel like I'm favoring their sister so am I?\n\nEdit: I don't only spend 1 hour a week with my kids, I spend 1 hour \"1:1\" with each kid. I also spend a lot of time with them doing things as a family. I wanted to clarify that since people seem to think I'm ignoring them for the rest of the week\n\nEdit 2: so after reading all the comments Irealized that I need to treat all my kids equally so I sat them down and told them that from now on they will all be treated completely equally. \n\nI canceled all the swimming time with 14yo and told her I will only swim for 3 hour with her and I will also spend 3 hours with each of her siblings. This leaves me with no \"me time\" but ok\n\nThem when the 16yo asked me to give her a ride to her friend's home I reminded her that they are all equal now. Her siblings never ask me for a ride to friend's home so neither should she. She had to take the bus and was not happy about it.\n\nAnd when 17yo asked me for some extra money to buy something I reminded him that they all got their equal allowances, he is the only one asking for extra money and that wouldn't be fair, so he is not getting it.\n\nI also changed their chores, since 14yo always did more chores than the rest they will be doing more chores from now on to make it all equal\n\nI will continue to treat them all equally from now on\n\nThis is not a punishment, it's hopefully a lesson to make them realize that equal is not always fair", "created_utc": 1674901159, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nbwa9/aita_for_spending_more_time_with_one_of_my_kids/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I come from a family of 4 girls, like yours. My Dad clearly favored the first born, but it was because they just clicked.  Even as adults they were close.  The rest of us were just \u201cthere\u201d.  i don\u2019t think Dad and the favored daughter were aware of the unspoken resentment and jealousy the other daughters had.  It wasn\u2019t huge resentment, but it was there.  After Dad died, the favored daughter wanted each of us to share some of our favorite memories of Dad.  She was in complete shock that our memories were not very favorable.  It was only at that moment that she realized the huge difference between her relationship with Dad, and ours. She never raised the subject again.   \njust think about this, as you consider your wife\u2019s request.", "When I first read your post, I originally was leaning toward NAH but, in reading your comments, YTA. \nImagine being your other children and having your father spend 10x as much time with your sibling than he does with you. It's hurtful and harmful. \nYour wife is right, it's your job to take an interest in them, not their job to take an interest in you. Particularly your 9 year old, who is far younger than all of her siblings and needs your support and attention. \nBe a father here, not a friend.", ">Recently my wife told me that the rest of our kids feel like I pay more attention to 14yo and spend more time with her. I told her that they are all welocme to join us then. She said that this is not how it works, I should be the one trying the kids hobbies not the other way around.\n\nYTA.\n\nMy dad is a car guy, he worked long hours and would watch F1 on the weekends and work on cars he would take to the track.\n\nI would say about 90% of the time I spent with my dad as a kid was only ever doing car stuff he wanted. I hated it, I resented it, we only ever had small amount of bonding but only when I was doing car stuff with him. I don't have a much of a relationship with him as an adult as a result. My other siblings barely tried to do any car stuff, he has almost no relationship with them.\n\nTake a lesson from my dad, don't do that. Be involved in your KIDS LIVES, not the other way around.", "YTA.  After reading your comments to other people, I can see your stuck in your ways, you have literally come here to invalidate your wife and kids feelings.  You can not see how the 14 year old is being favored.  It will cause issues for her and her siblings, which you have complete control over to stop.  It is amazing that your children already see how there are two classes of children.\n\nAs parent a parent spending 1 hour with 3 kids and 9-10 hours with another will cause animosity.  You are not making the kids feel this, its because your actually doing said action.  Your literally blind to a situation that is brewing.", "YTA\n\nYou absolutely ARE showing favoritism to the 14 year old.   \n\n>\"I should be allowed to do my own hobby as well\"\n\nYour wife doesn't have an issue with you swimming and indulging in that hobby; She has problem with the fact that the hobby time has turned into an additional 8-9 hours of one-on-one time with 14 year old and Dad that the 17, 16, and 9 year olds aren't getting.   \n\nIf 14 year old wants to join you for swimming, let that be her 1:1 activity for the week.", "YTA. But a small one. Ask yourself, how would you have felt if you had/have siblings and one parents spent 9 x more time with your sibling and gave you a pity hour once a week? You'd feel pretty shit right? Whether you're actually slighting your other children or not is completely irrelevant, your kids feel that you are. Whether this is true, perceived and who is the arsehole in all of this aren't the questions you should be asking yourself or us. How you can make your kids feel better about their relationship with you is the actual question you should be asking. If you don't have the time to add more hours with the other children, then you'll have to reduce the time with the 14yo. Just because you happen to share a hobby shouldn't be what constitutes how much your children get to spend time with their dad.", "YTA.  It's all about you.  If the 14 year old didn't like swimming, you'd still do it 10hrs a week and limit your time to an hour on her too.", "Nah. You spend time with all the kids but you do end up spending more time with one because of your hobby. Personally, I think you should make up for that and either cut down on the swimming with the one child and/or spend even more time with the others. I wouldn\u2019t call anyone an asshole here because i feel like it\u2019s a very easy fix but also everyone has valid concerns. \n\nAt the end of the day, as a twin sister (there was a lot of competition with attention) it is a really shitty feeling to see your parent(s) give more of their time and attention to your sibling. Keep that in mind when you spend 8-9 more hours with one kid than the others.", "Yta- you\u2019re the parent and should be putting in the effort to spend time with your other children. Keep doing your hobby and bring your 14 year old, but find other things to do with your other children too - they\u2019re just as important as your hobby and your 14 year old.", "Wait until your kids are grown and the resentment is high. I can only imagine how you\u2019re treat the other kids for approaching you and telling you how they really feel. \u201cBut 14 year favors me\u2026therefore is owed more time\u201d\n\nAre we so certain they want to be around you? Or are you just trying to justify why they don\u2019t want spend time with you\u2026because what if this post is actually about that. \n\nA 17 and 16 year old will be able to point this favoritism out.\n\nHow is 1 hour of 1:1 time with kids a week good enough, like if you do anything with them\u2026does this include driving time to places? Like if it takes 15m to get somewhere do they only have rest of that hour\n\nMy dad did this to my sister with soccer. I resent the hell out of him, but like most boomers they have the emotional intelligence of piece of paper. \n\nDo you have the emotional intelligence of a piece of paper?", "YTA. Going swimming four+ times a week and only taking that one kid with you may not INTENTIONALLY be showing favoritism, but clearly it presents that way to your other kids. Cut down on your swim time and spend more 1:1 time with your other children. \n\nIn fact, now that I think about it, you have four swim days and four kids. Cut it down to one swim day and find out which activity each of your other kids enjoys most. Do that with them. As a father you have to make compromises; you can't just allocate your time based on which kids like activities you also like. That's selfish.", "YTA. I get wanting to spend time on your hobby/exercise, but if there is so little free time to go around and the other kids are actually stating, \"We miss our Dad, we would like to spend more time with him\", you should really try to find a way to make that work. A family is not a number of hours per week divided by family members. It's a group of people building their lives around each other.", "NTA but you could make some more effort with the others. Having time to go swimming at least 4 times a week is a luxury, and it\u2019s great exercise and a bonus that your 14yo also enjoys it but maybe you could rebalance by going 3 times a week and then trying to do something active that the others enjoy.\n\nIf you\u2019re not willing to change your routine in in order to prioritise you\u2019re children then that the would change my vote to you being the AH.", "yta\n\ni mean, you are favouring her so much that the other children are noticing it already. imo you should try to make it up to the other children so they dont feel neglected or stop spending time with the 14 year old so much. i mean, 9-10h a week if only the other only get 1 hour, thats not fair and your wife is right.", "YTA. Nothing wrong with you sharing a hobby with one of your children. If you do - you need to massively step up your game with the other three  - EVEN if it means you lose some of your hobby time.  Your children know you're favoring one child.  They know you don't care.  You are damaging your relationship with them. And from your comments. You don't even care.", "NTA.  But you might want to talk to your whole family together and let everyone get their feelings out.  Maybe the kids who don't swim will decide to try it, or at least understand why you and their sister love it so much.", "NTA becoming more mature and using my brain made me aware that sometimes if I wanted to spend more time with ppl I love I have to do that by engaging in their activities/hobbies even if I don\u2019t like them it\u2019s not all about me! You\u2019re already spending time with them INDIVIDUALLY(engaging in their hobbies/wants) AND AS A FAMILY. The only reason your 14yo is with you more is bc she shares the same hobbies as you if that stops so does the extra time. It would be punishing your 14yo(who\u2019s done absolutely nothing wrong but share the same hobbies as her father) and that\u2019s going to do nothing but add more drama, animosity, hurt feelings and it\u2019s definitely going to fracture relationships. I recommend FAMILY THERAPY with a dose of reality for your other kids bc if they\u2019re running around thinking that they\u2019ll always be treated the same they\u2019re going to be in for a shock. It\u2019s always going to be one kid who needs more support, more time and more expenses hell it\u2019s always more of something. They can either engage more with the hobby of two family members they deem spend more time together OR they can do something together they all enjoy while y\u2019all are out OR everyone can stop doing their own hobbies including your wife and stop the one on one times and only do things together so it\u2019s no question that there\u2019s no \u201cfavoritism\u201d.\n\nSN: your almost college bound children could be feeling left out if they plan on going away to school. They could feel they\u2019re being phased out.", "NTA\nIs OP supposed to just get an extra 27 hours a week out of no where to spend it with each other kid or is he just meant to tell the 14 yo she can\u2019t come with him anymore because those seem to be the only options all the YTA people are coming up with. He spends alone time with each kid doing their hobbies. He only spends time doing his hobby snd 14yo just so happens to enjoy that hobby aswell and comes with him when he does it.", " NTA at all. This comments section is a dumpster fire. You\u2019re making an effort with all your kids but you\u2019re supposed to give up your own physical activity for \u201cfairness\u201d? What a load of BS. If your other kids want more time with you, they are free to join you, because you\u2019re going to the pool anyway. Maybe a family meeting is in order so you can clear the air.", "NTA - what are you gonna do give up your swimming or tell your 14 yr old she can\u2019t come with you? Both those choices are unacceptable. Talk to your other kids and explain you only spend more time with their sibling because of your joint love of swimming. It in no way reflects how you feel about them. Perhaps ask them if there is anything they feel they would like you to be more involved in and try to do that.", "NTA. You have your hobby. If only 1 child chooses to join you and others don't, it doesn't mean you HAVE to spend the same amount of time with others. They've made their choice. You're still making an effort to spend time with them doing what they enjoy doing, so why wouldn't they make an effort in return? It works both ways. If they want more time with you and they know you enjoy swimming, they might go with you once or twice a week. But they choose not to. And that doesn't make you an AH. Your wife, however... A bit. I mean demanding from you to be the only one to make any effort or changes to your routine - kind of an AH move tbh.", "NTA. All the other kids are welcome and given the opportunity but choose not to participate, you nor the 14 yo should have to accommodate their lack of participation nor should either of you be made to feel bad about it.", "NTA. All the children are invited to the swim.  Is 14f to be denied to attend because others decide not to?   Perhaps there is an activity that all would enjoy together.  Maybe children can be polled to see if that is possible.  Mom's analysis doesn't account for the fact that swimming is an open invitation for all to attend.   Just my thoughts for your consideration.  Be happy.", "NTA you have the right to have some times for you especially if at other moment you're still close to the rest of the family and overall if you're totally up to enjoyed your swimming times with who is ready to share it (it's a sane activity afterall).", "Honestly YTA just for thinking this is okay and trying to justify your position here. This isn't a place for vindication on this. Spend more time with your other kids. Trust me, the cost of it will be worth it later in life. Unless you like the idea of your 14 year old daughter being the only member of your family you have contact with in the near future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't think there's a good answer tbh.\n\nDo your other kids actually feel put out? Or is wife just assuming that, or feeling jealous/upset on behalf of them (without actual input from them?) Is she oversensitive where her kids are concerned, where she might be seeing things that aren't there? \n\nEven if the kids are upset, that's valid. It sucks when one parent gets along better with one kid. But also...that happens. Your kids are all different people, and you'll have different relationships with them all. It sucks that you haven't found something to bond over with the other kids, but with that said...\n\nIs it really fair to deny you and 14 your swimming time together? Is it fair to say to your daughter \"sorry we can't swim as often anymore\"? Is it fair to ask you both to change up your schedules and have less special, happy time? I don't think so. \n\nYou're doing what you can, having one on one time with all kids, and doing family activities. But they're growing up, getting older. You and 16 might not have this opportunity forever. Maybe you and 19 will find ways of bonding more down the road. Maybe you and 17 discover a hobby you both love one day. You don't know what's going to happen. \n\nI have a lot of siblings and let me tell you...making exactly perfect time with each kid is impossible, especially at the ages they are. With the older ones, maybe you can sit them down, see if you can find more common ground. They're old enough to be able to help problem solve and maybe come up with solutions that work. Maybe it won't \"even out\" but it might help to 1.) make more time for each kid in special ways but more importantly 2.) foster closer/deeper connections with them. 9 might be too young and might still be in an age where you have to grin and bear whatever it is, idk. \n\nBut it feels deeply unfair to sort of rob you and 14 of this great thing you have right now. Maybe the other kids might be willing to, if not swim, at least hang out around the pool? Chill out with a book or a phone, and cheer y'all on or whatever. Go out for brunch or a snack afterwards? Food for thought!", "NTA, it\u2019s your hobby and has been so for what seems like a long time. Though it wouldn\u2019t hurt for you to make some more effort with your other kids, taking an interest in the others\u2019 interests should go both ways.

He can do that by making more time in his schedule for them. Maybe that means he sleeps less or swims less or something else that is him time right now. \n\nBut, if the 14-year-old wants to swim that much, she shouldn\u2019t be the one making sacrifices that a parent should make.", "Do none of y\u2019all understand how swimming works?

You're acting like there's no middle ground.\n\nCompromise. \n\nPart of being a parent is making sacrifices for your children.", "Neither. You can spend the same amount hours with your other kids, enroll your 14yo in a swim team so she can still enjoy her hobby, you can reduce your hours and maybe add another exercise activity you could do with all of your kids or you could just suck it up and stop being such a petty cry baby. Seriously. They are your children. Decisions like these are what stand between you having an awesome relationship with them or being alone and decrepit in a third world level old folks home, cause that's all they're willing to shell out to keep you alive until you die alone. If you didn't want to spend time with all of your children, wrap it in a condom next life round. Now, this is the life you have and if making your children happy means having to sacrifice your hobby if you have no other options that work for all of you, then that's what's going to have to happen.\n\nOr are you aiming for a relationship I have with my dad where I honestly don't think it would move me much one way or the other if he suddenly died tomorrow?", "I mean yes, you might have to reduce the time you spend on your hobby to instead spend time with your other children. Not sure why that\u2019s a hard conclusion to reach.\n\nAlso your 14 year old can swim without you.
