I have a break to finally post this.\n\nAs I guessed, family did indeed find this. Between 7 uncles, one of my cousins likely shown them the post I originally made. It was obviously not received well lol. Anyways, I'm just going to go down in list order of things or events that have happened:\n\n**My Dad**: First off, he wanted me to tell all of you that he loved all the support and that he wishes to Dad all of you as well. His words: \"It took 2 of us to make you, and I gotta say I love my work. Any parent that doesn't should never have tried.\"\n\n**My Mom**: She had called me asking why I brought up the events of my uncle's wedding. I told her that I was simply having a good time with my husband and everyone else. That my uncle's made the conscious decision to want to start a problem. She got mad and said she just wanted to have a good party. I told her that I didn't want to be attacked for my sexuality and not inviting blatant bigots to my wedding, but that I'm glad her party meant more to her.\n\nWe got into a shouting match over the phone. I told my dad what happened and he's livid with her. They got into a fight and now she's staying at my grandma's. I've apologized profusely to my dad but he's telling me to let it go and that I've done nothing wrong. Above all else, this is what hurts the most. She was always so very supportive of me and it feels like a massive bomb shell was just dropped out of nowhere.\n\n**My Bi-Uncle**: Unbeknownst to me, my husband invited him over so he and I could have a heart to heart about what happened. It annoyed me a little bit but I am glad he invited him over. We talked about the post I made and he saw everyone's comments. According to him, it kind of opened him up to the shit he was just ignoring so he could pretend to have a close bond with all his brothers. At the same time though, he's still not sure what to do from here. We talked for a few hours, had a good cry hug about it. Everything is good on that front and it makes me happy. He'll be seeking therapy to help him deal with his feelings on this.\n\n**The \"Other\" uncles**: Obviously they are livid with me. They couldn't believe that I post something like that blasting them on the internet. They said they didn't like being painted the way I posted them. So I just straight up asked them if they thought my bi uncle was going to hell because of his marriage. To my shock, they had no problem saying yes. They didn't even try to like dance around it. In the end, I told them that if they didn't want to be painted as bigots, to lose the religious bigotted act. Plain and simple.\n\nMy husband has been non-stop trying to comfort me after the shouting match with my mom. He can see the immense pain I'm in. I love that man very much though. He took me out for Steak and Old Fashions the other night to help get me relaxed.\n\nThat's all folks.

Hopefully, she will come around and realize her mistake. As for the rest of your family, you're right, if they don't want to be \"painted\" that way, then they should stop posing that way. They're mad you had the audacity to expose them to people who fund their behavior toxic. I wish I could tell you just let it go, but I didn't talk to my own mother for nearly 2 years, and I know that hurts like nothing else. Thank you for the update! I'm happy to know you have a husband who cares so much for you. And your dad!! What a hero. I wish all the alphabet club can have a dad like this, he is a rare gem. Keep your head up and keep going.", "(((hugs))) for OP, Uncle, husband, and dad \n\nEdit: added dad.", "NTA.\n\nIt's *your* wedding, and anyone who questions who was or wasn't invited can stfu.\n\nThe whole point of that day is committing yourself to that one other person.

I'm hoping your mom ends up seeing that she's wrong and apologizes to you.\n\nYour bi uncle's feelings on the situation are very valid, and it's great that you two were able to talk about it. It's also great that he's at least recognized that he's putting up with unacceptable behavior for the sake of a relationship with people who aren't worth his time. Whatever he decides to do with that information is his decision, but it's a start.\n\nAs for your other uncles, fuck em. You don't need them. I wouldn't be shocked if you get some advice that you should stay away from events where they are, and while I understand that perspective and it's an option you should consider if you want to, I don't think it's incumbent upon you to remove yourself from a party you might otherwise want to go to because they're bigots. Certainly, you seemed to have no issues shutting them down when they started on you. Maybe they'll think twice before they do it again. Either way, it should be on them to remove themselves from the situation, not you.", "As a fellow gay, I think you handled everything brilliantly. I\u2019m sorry your mum is upset with you for standing your ground; but it sounds like she might have some internalised homophobia that needs to be addressed. Your dad sounds like a stand-up gent.

How far can one's head be up their ass?", "When I got married I refused to invite the abusive uncle that I despise. He abused my cousins and aunt for years (I just found about all of this a couple years ago), and I just hate to be around him. My grandparents were devastated that I didn't want an abusive alcoholic at my wedding and I told them the honest truth. My abusive uncle is upset and I couldn't care less. My family likes to sweep that stuff under the rug which is why I haven't seen my cousins or aunt in years because they moved across the country to get away from him. I refuse to do that.\n\nYou are in no way TA. Protect yourself and your husband. No one needs that kind of stuff darkening a beautiful time in your life.\n\nCongratulations on the marriage!!!", ">They said they didn't like being painted the way I posted them.\n\nTo quote an old friend of mine: \"You didn't paint shit, you just put the artwork on display.\"\n\nHope things get better with your mom!", "I'm so glad you have your wonderful father and husband, and I'm so sorry that the rest of your family is choosing to be so hateful.", "Your mom needs to get her stuff put together.", "Aw you have the best Dad, Husband and Uncle.", "NTA! It sounds like you've done everything you can to make your values clear. I'm sorry that your Mom is caught up in people pleasing land that she can't see the right and wrong sides of this. I hope that she gets to a place where she can see the error of her alliances. \n\nThe one group that you left out of the update is the silent group of witnesses (cousins, nieces, nephews, other relatives, and friends, etc) who may be deeply closeted and struggling with their own identities in the face of a family in which there is a loud and aggressively bigoted group of \"elders\". For them, you standing up and making your values clearly known in the face of lots of opposition means everything. You never know who you might be saving when you stand up for what's right and tolerant. Congratulations on your marriage!

She knows that side of the family well enough to tell them that wasn\u2019t the time or place. Why waste money and time and energy when you know the answer. They didn\u2019t even deny they were going to say no. If they didn\u2019t want the truth, they shouldn\u2019t have asked. ALSO! Who gets mad they weren\u2019t invited to an event they were going to decline attending? At that point, they were going to use their \u201cno\u201d as a way to hurt your feelings.

Thanks dad.", "First off - your husband and your dad sound like wonderful men, and I wish you all the very best! Everyone needs to have at least two ride-or-dies, and you've got them! \n\nSecond, I'm so sorry about your mom's reaction. She may be hurt and upset for the time being, but hopefully she'll come around. Most moms are usually pretty good about letting things go (I know it's not always the case, but I'm hoping it is for you).\n\nThird, the uncles... I'm so glad you and the good tio are on good terms. Hopefully the two of you can continue to bond and strengthen your relationship. As for the rest of them... fuck 'em and good riddance!", "Your dad is great. So is your SO.

I'm happy your bi uncle is getting therapy too. Big hugs again young man", "As they\u2019re going to find this post too\u2026 just a few words to your family. \nYou all sound so good good natured all round, that even though you have very different views, it sounds as though they have been addressed in the main with good humour and love\u2026 that you still want to get together as a family, that not being invited has hurt, that falling out has hurt even more. Even though there are problems, you are still much closer than so many other families on this Reddit. \nI\u2019m not going to go on the attack here, but is there any chance you can get together and talk calmly\u2026 uncles, even if you disagree, the lgbt issues aren\u2019t going away, love and celebrate your family as they love you. There\u2019s lots of support out there if you need it. \nDon\u2019t let your family suffer.", "It is wonderful to see his dad support his every move and LOVE his every move!!! It is also probs worth remembering the uncle is very use to horrific behaviour and even tho he doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat, he can\u2019t expect others not to, every action has a reaction! \n\nWe all love you and are so proud of you and from an LGBTQ person to another I think the whole things was STUNNING \ud83e\udd29 \n\nHave a wonderful and healthy future x", "I love this. Exactly!", "There isn't really terribly much to say about the silent witnesses. If anything, the silent witnesses are the reason there is an update post in the first place haha. All the behind the scenes chisme and shit talking lol.", "I just mean that it's nice to remember that your actions and standing up for yourself could be the very thing that gives others who are silently struggling a feeling of solidarity and support.", "Love the postage stamp remark! \n\nYour uncles are pissed because they didn't get an official chance to spurn you? Too bad, soo sad.\n\nYour bi uncle may have lost a brother or two, but he's gaining a new nephew. May your happy family keep growing!", "I\u2019m a little sad your mom took the stance she did. My youngest recently came out and I, with her permission, gave a heads up to my dad and bonus mom. My dad started to say something I thought was going to be negative and I was all kinds of prepared to tell him to think about what he truly wanted to express because I would have no issues cutting him out if I needed to.", "I\u2019m glad you worked it out with the uncle that matters.  Your dad is awesome.  Hopefully your mom will come around since your uncles started this mess with being homophobic.  Sometimes you have to point out to your parent that accepting their homophobic behavior does more damage than good.  Hopefully your dad rubs off on her enough to drag her to happy side.", "I love your dad. He knows what's what.\n\nGood for you, kid.", "First, your dad is now my favorite dad, holy crap.  \n\nSecond, I'm sorry about the fight with your mom, but it'll be okay. She sadly showed her true colors, apparently, but hopefully she'll come around.  \n\nThird, HEY BIGOT UNCLES, IF YOU SEE THIS, YOU SUCK and I'm gonna kiss my partner in your honor (both of us are bi and nonbinary).  \n\nAnd lastly, you did absolutely nothing wrong. Anyone who thinks you should be quiet to not ruffle bigot feathers isn't someone who you need in your life. Take time to heal, and if you're able, therapy could help you work through the emotions with you and your mom's fight.  \n\nGive your husband and dad a hug, and your bi uncle, cry on their shoulders, let yourself mourn and feel what you have to. Just know that it'll be okay eventually. Sometimes, it takes time, but it'll work out.

You are telling them the truth. They don't like what it looks like. They need to change the way they behave then. Keep telling them the truth. I'm sorry your mom doesn't place the blame on the Uncles that started the conversation. They asked a question and didn't like the truth. You didn't start the fight. You just didn't lie to anyone.

Way to go, husband, dad, and bi- uncle!!!! Way to go you, for talking it out with your bi uncle and sharing your point of view in a way that doesn't judge him. Everyone else sucks. Uncles just wanted the satisfaction of turning down the invite and talking to each other about how you're \"going to hell\".  Maybe mom has always been more ambivalent than actively supportive, and this gathering triggered her to express anger at you, perhaps anger at your being \"different\" rather than at \"ruining\" her gathering. Hopefully when she cools down you two can have a frank talk about how she truly feels. Even if her response on her true beliefs makes one or both of you uncomfortable, at least you'd know. Her continuing to avoid the topic could indicate that she doesn't want to face her true beliefs on the topic.", "Give your ma time.

Nope, still bigots, just don't want it pointed out. Also, invites are like 3 bucks each, plus require a special stamp.

It was added centuries after the book was written, for the sole purpose of spreading homophobia. Your uncles buy into this because they aren't good people.

Maybe she has some internalized homophobia, but from you saying she has been very supportive before this, I really wonder if she just doesn't want the stress of feeling like everyone is upset from an event that was in her home. It sounds like people pleaser behavior to want you to stay quiet at great cost to you just so she doesn't have to have fights in her home. If this sounds feasible with your mom, once you both cool off, maybe this could be something to address.

It\u2019s stressful figuring out who to invite and who not to, especially when you have a limited number of guests to work with. We consider our friends our family.  So many great memories of our relationship are because of these people.  But we were pressured to invite family members who we either had never met, or hadn\u2019t seen in a decade(s).

You, sir, are what I worked hard for decades ago.   You stood up and didn\u2019t accept hate from people but returned it right back to them so they could taste their own emotional crap.  Love this whole post.    Big hugs to your uncle.  I\u2019m sure you inspired him and will continue to do so.   You guys deserve more than you\u2019re getting.   \n\nAlso, I\u2019m in love w your dad.  You get your bravery from him.   Good work all around by you both!", "I love the bigoted uncles' energy here. How dare you state exactly what happened in your own life without first clearing it with us. Hilarious.", "Your dad continues to be the epitome of dadding. \n\nSorry about your mom. Glad that you and bi-uncle worked it out. \n\nYour awful uncles are giving \u201cyou can\u2019t fire me, I quit!\u201d Energy. They\u2019re just mad because you fired them first.", "Yeah that's what gets me. Per OP, *both* his parents wanted him there and insisted despite his reluctance. And he was reluctant, in part, because something like this might happen.\n\nShe could have just respected OP's original desire to stay away and her party would've gone just fine.", "> Bummer that he's in the dog house.\n\nIs he though? \n\nHe\u2019s not the one who had to go stay with his parents. He\u2019s the one who gets to stay in his own house, sleep in his own bed, and scroll through Reddit to see all the comments about what a good dad (and person) he is.  \n\nOP\u2019s mom is the one in the dog house. She\u2019s the one who got kicked out of her home, the one who has to go stay with her parents until she learns to stop being an AH, and the one who gets to scroll through Reddit and see all the comments about what a disgusting human being and complete failure as a mother she is.", "So far they can see their vocal cords move.", "Did he say something negative?  Or it turned out ok?", "You misunderstand.  They weren't hurt that they can't attend the wedding.  They're hurt that he didn't let them say no.  Why am I so sure of that, they're still homophobic enough to say that their own brother is going to hell for loving a man.\n\nOP's uncles, if you really wanted to attend the wedding, prove it wrong.  Tell your nephew you just want to celebrate the love of your nephew and his husband.  Call your brother, and apologize for the pain you've caused, for all of the comments you made before.", "Ding ding ding!  They probably hated not having the opportunity to say no, they have no power over him now.", "The chismosos will always find something else to gossip about. After this it'll be something else lol", "No, he didn\u2019t. I think he might be struggling with it a little but he\u2019s always been a very thoughtful man and I know he is very open minded. I think he worries more about her in a world that still has prejudice.", "Oh yeah, I was once in similar shoes.  Started saying something like that, the other person tensed up, and then visibly relaxed when they realized that I was actually welcoming, I was just worried about others' reactions.", "Fuck your uncles. Treating family like that, more than anything in these posts, should earn a ticket to hell, if such a place existed.", "You have an amazing husband and a wonderful father. If heaven is filled with people like your straight uncles, I\u2019d rather be in hell with the funcles and guncles. \nCongratulations on happily ever after \u2764\ufe0f", "I love your dad and your husband, Those who matter don\u2019t mind, and those who mind don\u2019t matter.. congratulations and much love in your future. \ud83d\udc9c", "I absolutely love your dad.  He is father of the year and I would like to adopt him and you and your husband because you all are fucking amazing!", "Hey OP\u2019s other uncles? I\u2019m an ace enby so I\u2019m already going straight to hell according to you, which means if you\u2019re reading this, I can say- you\u2019re all assholes, and yes, for you *personally,* I do also mean it Like That. \n\n(Hey any current or former Christians who paid more attention in Bible class than I did, what\u2019s the Bible\u2019s men-shouldn\u2019t-wear-women\u2019s-clothes-etc section say about people who are not men or women? Can I wear all the clothes, or yanno none of them?)", "I feel like your mother is unfortunately a fair weather ally - she's all for gay rights *until* that means she actually has to sacrifice something or do real work, at which point she promptly throws the LGBTQ community under the bus to get what she wants. \n\n I'm really sorry you had to find that out the hard way, because it sucks. People deserve to have parents who support them; and I'm glad at least one of yours does. \n\nI also feel really sad that your bi uncle felt the need to play nice with people who *literally* think he's going to hell, just because \"tHey'RE FaMilY\". Blood relations really don't mean anything, if those people don't love and support you.", "Hey OP, hope you had a great wedding. Anyone who declines an invitation for \"religious reasons\" instead of just saying \"no, I'm unable to come\" is already an AH.\nIt's not required to give a reason for declining.\nI hope you, your dad, your husband and uncle can all support each other. And any other chosen family you might have.", "Please tell your dad I love him.\n\nI'm sorry about your mom. She reminds me a bit of my father and if she's anything like him you're better off without her", "Just a suggestion if your \"other\" uncles bring this up again. You should tell them to cut the bullshit and admit that they would not have attended if they had been invited. That they weren't upset about not being invited because they \"at least wanting to be thought about.\" They were upset because they didn't have the opportunity to tell you what they thought about you and your marriage by refusing to go. That it was actually about them not being able to rub your nose in their disapproval and bigotry.", "Obviously, NTA at all. You can be religious and not be a bigot. My uncle is gay, and he's married to a FABULOUS man. They have an open marriage. I love their fiance, and it does work very well for the three of them. Even though I personally feel marriage is supposed to be between 2 people, I can't imagine him not being apart of the family. They're all just amazing guys!!! Love is love, and that includes loving family, friends, your neighbor, etc (unless they're crappy humans)."]}
