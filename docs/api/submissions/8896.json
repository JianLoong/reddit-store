I have a break to finally post this.\n\nAs I guessed, family did indeed find this. Between 7 uncles, one of my cousins likely shown them the post I originally made. It was obviously not received well lol. Anyways, I'm just going to go down in list order of things or events that have happened:\n\n**My Dad**: First off, he wanted me to tell all of you that he loved all the support and that he wishes to Dad all of you as well. His words: \"It took 2 of us to make you, and I gotta say I love my work. Any parent that doesn't should never have tried.\"\n\n**My Mom**: She had called me asking why I brought up the events of my uncle's wedding. I told her that I was simply having a good time with my husband and everyone else. That my uncle's made the conscious decision to want to start a problem. She got mad and said she just wanted to have a good party. I told her that I didn't want to be attacked for my sexuality and not inviting blatant bigots to my wedding, but that I'm glad her party meant more to her.\n\nWe got into a shouting match over the phone. I told my dad what happened and he's livid with her. They got into a fight and now she's staying at my grandma's. I've apologized profusely to my dad but he's telling me to let it go and that I've done nothing wrong. Above all else, this is what hurts the most. She was always so very supportive of me and it feels like a massive bomb shell was just dropped out of nowhere.\n\n**My Bi-Uncle**: Unbeknownst to me, my husband invited him over so he and I could have a heart to heart about what happened. It annoyed me a little bit but I am glad he invited him over. We talked about the post I made and he saw everyone's comments. According to him, it kind of opened him up to the shit he was just ignoring so he could pretend to have a close bond with all his brothers. At the same time though, he's still not sure what to do from here. We talked for a few hours, had a good cry hug about it. Everything is good on that front and it makes me happy. He'll be seeking therapy to help him deal with his feelings on this.\n\n**The \"Other\" uncles**: Obviously they are livid with me. They couldn't believe that I post something like that blasting them on the internet. They said they didn't like being painted the way I posted them. So I just straight up asked them if they thought my bi uncle was going to hell because of his marriage. To my shock, they had no problem saying yes. They didn't even try to like dance around it. In the end, I told them that if they didn't want to be painted as bigots, to lose the religious bigotted act. Plain and simple.\n\nMy husband has been non-stop trying to comfort me after the shouting match with my mom. He can see the immense pain I'm in. I love that man very much though. He took me out for Steak and Old Fashions the other night to help get me relaxed.\n\nThat's all folks.

Your Dad and husband are wonderful and the fact that your uncle is willing to sit and have a mature conversation with you shows that he\u2019s worth having around. \n\nYour mom seems to have the preformative \u201cIll support this until it\u2019s not convienant for me to do so\u201d attitude and I hope she sees the light soon.\n\nAnd fuck everyone else \u270c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffb", "If your straight uncles feel comfortable posting shit on their social media dehumanizing you and their bi brother, they really have no room to feel any sort of way about your use of social media.\n\nThat said, your dad seems cool as hell. Bummer that he's in the dog house.", "I'm glad to hear you're on good terms with your dad and uncle. I'm sorry to hear your mom is not as supportive as you thought. Hopefully, she will come around and realize her mistake. As for the rest of your family, you're right, if they don't want to be \"painted\" that way, then they should stop posing that way. They're mad you had the audacity to expose them to people who fund their behavior toxic. I wish I could tell you just let it go, but I didn't talk to my own mother for nearly 2 years, and I know that hurts like nothing else. Thank you for the update! I'm happy to know you have a husband who cares so much for you. And your dad!! What a hero. I wish all the alphabet club can have a dad like this, he is a rare gem. Keep your head up and keep going.", "(((hugs))) for OP, Uncle, and husband", "NTA.\n\nIt's *your* wedding, and anyone who questions who was or wasn't invited can stfu.\n\nThe whole point of that day is committing yourself to that one other person.  If your family is causing issues over this now, it's not going to change after the ceremony.", "Your dad sounds amazing, him and your husband being around you are so important given the situation. I'm hoping your mom ends up seeing that she's wrong and apologizes to you.\n\nYour bi uncle's feelings on the situation are very valid, and it's great that you two were able to talk about it. It's also great that he's at least recognized that he's putting up with unacceptable behavior for the sake of a relationship with people who aren't worth his time. Whatever he decides to do with that information is his decision, but it's a start.\n\nAs for your other uncles, fuck em. You don't need them. I wouldn't be shocked if you get some advice that you should stay away from events where they are, and while I understand that perspective and it's an option you should consider if you want to, I don't think it's incumbent upon you to remove yourself from a party you might otherwise want to go to because they're bigots. Certainly, you seemed to have no issues shutting them down when they started on you. Maybe they'll think twice before they do it again. Either way, it should be on them to remove themselves from the situation, not you.", "As a fellow gay, I think you handled everything brilliantly. I\u2019m sorry your mum is upset with you for standing your ground; but it sounds like she might have some internalised homophobia that needs to be addressed. Your dad sounds like a stand-up gent. Best of luck to you going forward.", "The audacity of someone to say \"You're going to hell for who you love\" and \"Why wasn't I invited to the wedding?\" in the same breath. Unparalleled. How far can one's head be up their ass?", "When I got married I refused to invite the abusive uncle that I despise. He abused my cousins and aunt for years (I just found about all of this a couple years ago), and I just hate to be around him. My grandparents were devastated that I didn't want an abusive alcoholic at my wedding and I told them the honest truth. My abusive uncle is upset and I couldn't care less. My family likes to sweep that stuff under the rug which is why I haven't seen my cousins or aunt in years because they moved across the country to get away from him. I refuse to do that.\n\nYou are in no way TA. Protect yourself and your husband. No one needs that kind of stuff darkening a beautiful time in your life.\n\nCongratulations on the marriage!!!", ">They said they didn't like being painted the way I posted them.\n\nTo quote an old friend of mine: \"You didn't paint shit, you just put the artwork on display.\"\n\nHope things get better with your mom!", "I'm so glad you have your wonderful father and husband, and I'm so sorry that the rest of your family is choosing to be so hateful.", "Your mom needs to get her stuff put together.", "Aw you have the best Dad, Husband and Uncle.", "NTA! It sounds like you've done everything you can to make your values clear. I'm sorry that your Mom is caught up in people pleasing land that she can't see the right and wrong sides of this. I hope that she gets to a place where she can see the error of her alliances. \n\nThe one group that you left out of the update is the silent group of witnesses (cousins, nieces, nephews, other relatives, and friends, etc) who may be deeply closeted and struggling with their own identities in the face of a family in which there is a loud and aggressively bigoted group of \"elders\". For them, you standing up and making your values clearly known in the face of lots of opposition means everything. You never know who you might be saving when you stand up for what's right and tolerant. Congratulations on your marriage! You picked a good one!", "As a queer person (who wishes they had this kind of love and support) - Your dad, husband, and uncle are awesome. And it is clear they are going to be there to support you. As for the rest of them - screw them. They are the AH in this situation, not you.", "&#x200B;\n\nyou and your husband both sound like keepers.   may you have all of the years together.", "I\u2019m shocked your mom is trying to put this on you. She knows that side of the family well enough to tell them that wasn\u2019t the time or place. Why waste money and time and energy when you know the answer. They didn\u2019t even deny they were going to say no. If they didn\u2019t want the truth, they shouldn\u2019t have asked. ALSO! Who gets mad they weren\u2019t invited to an event they were going to decline attending? At that point, they were going to use their \u201cno\u201d as a way to hurt your feelings. No one needs that kind of unnecessary drama.", "I love your dad.", "NTA on my way to work there\u2019s a sign that says \u201cJesus or he!!\u201d I struggle with it because Jesus seems like a good guy but his followers suck! Who do I want to be stuck with for eternity?", "Now you know who your REAL family is. Sending nothing but good vibes.", "Your dad just made me cry.  Thanks dad.", "First off - your husband and your dad sound like wonderful men, and I wish you all the very best! Everyone needs to have at least two ride-or-dies, and you've got them! \n\nSecond, I'm so sorry about your mom's reaction. She may be hurt and upset for the time being, but hopefully she'll come around. Most moms are usually pretty good about letting things go (I know it's not always the case, but I'm hoping it is for you).\n\nThird, the uncles... I'm so glad you and the good tio are on good terms. Hopefully the two of you can continue to bond and strengthen your relationship. As for the rest of them... fuck 'em and good riddance!", "Your dad is great. So is your SO. Things will sort themselves out with your mom. Your bad uncles are going to hell, so that's taken care of.", "Your uncles are just pissed that they didn't get the chance to turn you down.", "WHERE IS THE SIGN UP SHEET FOR YOUR DAD? (I could probably use some abuelita Spanish Side Eye and even a chancla)", "Also big hugs about your mom. I hope *you* have a therapist to talk to, maybe they can also have a session with your dad and you, to talk about what's positive and possible going forward. I'm happy your bi uncle is getting therapy too. Big hugs again young man", "As they\u2019re going to find this post too\u2026 just a few words to your family. \nYou all sound so good good natured all round, that even though you have very different views, it sounds as though they have been addressed in the main with good humour and love\u2026 that you still want to get together as a family, that not being invited has hurt, that falling out has hurt even more. Even though there are problems, you are still much closer than so many other families on this Reddit. \nI\u2019m not going to go on the attack here, but is there any chance you can get together and talk calmly\u2026 uncles, even if you disagree, the lgbt issues aren\u2019t going away, love and celebrate your family as they love you. There\u2019s lots of support out there if you need it. \nDon\u2019t let your family suffer.", "It is wonderful to see his dad support his every move and LOVE his every move!!! It is also probs worth remembering the uncle is very use to horrific behaviour and even tho he doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat, he can\u2019t expect others not to, every action has a reaction! \n\nWe all love you and are so proud of you and from an LGBTQ person to another I think the whole things was STUNNING \ud83e\udd29 \n\nHave a wonderful and healthy future x", "I love this. Exactly!", "There isn't really terribly much to say about the silent witnesses. If anything, the silent witnesses are the reason there is an update post in the first place haha. All the behind the scenes chisme and shit talking lol.", "I just mean that it's nice to remember that your actions and standing up for yourself could be the very thing that gives others who are silently struggling a feeling of solidarity and support."]}
