I have a break to finally post this.\n\nAs I guessed, family did indeed find this. Between 7 uncles, one of my cousins likely shown them the post I originally made. It was obviously not received well lol. Anyways, I'm just going to go down in list order of things or events that have happened:\n\n**My Dad**: First off, he wanted me to tell all of you that he loved all the support and that he wishes to Dad all of you as well. His words: \"It took 2 of us to make you, and I gotta say I love my work. Any parent that doesn't should never have tried.\"\n\n**My Mom**: She had called me asking why I brought up the events of my uncle's wedding. I told her that I was simply having a good time with my husband and everyone else. That my uncle's made the conscious decision to want to start a problem. She got mad and said she just wanted to have a good party. I told her that I didn't want to be attacked for my sexuality and not inviting blatant bigots to my wedding, but that I'm glad her party meant more to her.\n\nWe got into a shouting match over the phone. I told my dad what happened and he's livid with her. They got into a fight and now she's staying at my grandma's. I've apologized profusely to my dad but he's telling me to let it go and that I've done nothing wrong. Above all else, this is what hurts the most. She was always so very supportive of me and it feels like a massive bomb shell was just dropped out of nowhere.\n\n**My Bi-Uncle**: Unbeknownst to me, my husband invited him over so he and I could have a heart to heart about what happened. It annoyed me a little bit but I am glad he invited him over. We talked about the post I made and he saw everyone's comments. According to him, it kind of opened him up to the shit he was just ignoring so he could pretend to have a close bond with all his brothers. At the same time though, he's still not sure what to do from here. We talked for a few hours, had a good cry hug about it. Everything is good on that front and it makes me happy. He'll be seeking therapy to help him deal with his feelings on this.\n\n**The \"Other\" uncles**: Obviously they are livid with me. They couldn't believe that I post something like that blasting them on the internet. They said they didn't like being painted the way I posted them. So I just straight up asked them if they thought my bi uncle was going to hell because of his marriage. To my shock, they had no problem saying yes. They didn't even try to like dance around it. In the end, I told them that if they didn't want to be painted as bigots, to lose the religious bigotted act. Plain and simple.\n\nMy husband has been non-stop trying to comfort me after the shouting match with my mom. He can see the immense pain I'm in. I love that man very much though. He took me out for Steak and Old Fashions the other night to help get me relaxed.\n\nThat's all folks.

Your Dad and husband are wonderful and the fact that your uncle is willing to sit and have a mature conversation with you shows that he\u2019s worth having around. \n\nYour mom seems to have the preformative \u201cIll support this until it\u2019s not convienant for me to do so\u201d attitude and I hope she sees the light soon.\n\nAnd fuck everyone else \u270c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffb", "If your straight uncles feel comfortable posting shit on their social media dehumanizing you and their bi brother, they really have no room to feel any sort of way about your use of social media.\n\nThat said, your dad seems cool as hell. Bummer that he's in the dog house.", "I'm glad to hear you're on good terms with your dad and uncle. I'm sorry to hear your mom is not as supportive as you thought. Hopefully, she will come around and realize her mistake. As for the rest of your family, you're right, if they don't want to be \"painted\" that way, then they should stop posing that way. They're mad you had the audacity to expose them to people who fund their behavior toxic. I wish I could tell you just let it go, but I didn't talk to my own mother for nearly 2 years, and I know that hurts like nothing else. Thank you for the update! I'm happy to know you have a husband who cares so much for you. And your dad!! What a hero. I wish all the alphabet club can have a dad like this, he is a rare gem. Keep your head up and keep going.", "(((hugs))) for OP, Uncle, and husband", "NTA.\n\nIt's *your* wedding, and anyone who questions who was or wasn't invited can stfu.\n\nThe whole point of that day is committing yourself to that one other person.  If your family is causing issues over this now, it's not going to change after the ceremony.", "Your dad sounds amazing, him and your husband being around you are so important given the situation. I'm hoping your mom ends up seeing that she's wrong and apologizes to you.\n\nYour bi uncle's feelings on the situation are very valid, and it's great that you two were able to talk about it. It's also great that he's at least recognized that he's putting up with unacceptable behavior for the sake of a relationship with people who aren't worth his time. Whatever he decides to do with that information is his decision, but it's a start.\n\nAs for your other uncles, fuck em. You don't need them. I wouldn't be shocked if you get some advice that you should stay away from events where they are, and while I understand that perspective and it's an option you should consider if you want to, I don't think it's incumbent upon you to remove yourself from a party you might otherwise want to go to because they're bigots. Certainly, you seemed to have no issues shutting them down when they started on you. Maybe they'll think twice before they do it again. Either way, it should be on them to remove themselves from the situation, not you.", "As a fellow gay, I think you handled everything brilliantly. I\u2019m sorry your mum is upset with you for standing your ground; but it sounds like she might have some internalised homophobia that needs to be addressed. Your dad sounds like a stand-up gent. Best of luck to you going forward.", "The audacity of someone to say \"You're going to hell for who you love\" and \"Why wasn't I invited to the wedding?\" in the same breath. Unparalleled. How far can one's head be up their ass?", "When I got married I refused to invite the abusive uncle that I despise. He abused my cousins and aunt for years (I just found about all of this a couple years ago), and I just hate to be around him. My grandparents were devastated that I didn't want an abusive alcoholic at my wedding and I told them the honest truth. My abusive uncle is upset and I couldn't care less. My family likes to sweep that stuff under the rug which is why I haven't seen my cousins or aunt in years because they moved across the country to get away from him. I refuse to do that.\n\nYou are in no way TA. Protect yourself and your husband. No one needs that kind of stuff darkening a beautiful time in your life.\n\nCongratulations on the marriage!!!", ">They said they didn't like being painted the way I posted them.\n\nTo quote an old friend of mine: \"You didn't paint shit, you just put the artwork on display.\"\n\nHope things get better with your mom!", "I'm so glad you have your wonderful father and husband, and I'm so sorry that the rest of your family is choosing to be so hateful.", "Your mom needs to get her stuff put together.", "Aw you have the best Dad, Husband and Uncle.", "NTA! It sounds like you've done everything you can to make your values clear. I'm sorry that your Mom is caught up in people pleasing land that she can't see the right and wrong sides of this. I hope that she gets to a place where she can see the error of her alliances. \n\nThe one group that you left out of the update is the silent group of witnesses (cousins, nieces, nephews, other relatives, and friends, etc) who may be deeply closeted and struggling with their own identities in the face of a family in which there is a loud and aggressively bigoted group of \"elders\". For them, you standing up and making your values clearly known in the face of lots of opposition means everything. You never know who you might be saving when you stand up for what's right and tolerant. Congratulations on your marriage! You picked a good one!", "As a queer person (who wishes they had this kind of love and support) - Your dad, husband, and uncle are awesome. And it is clear they are going to be there to support you. As for the rest of them - screw them. They are the AH in this situation, not you.", "&#x200B;\n\nyou and your husband both sound like keepers.   may you have all of the years together.", "I\u2019m shocked your mom is trying to put this on you. She knows that side of the family well enough to tell them that wasn\u2019t the time or place. Why waste money and time and energy when you know the answer. They didn\u2019t even deny they were going to say no. If they didn\u2019t want the truth, they shouldn\u2019t have asked. ALSO! Who gets mad they weren\u2019t invited to an event they were going to decline attending? At that point, they were going to use their \u201cno\u201d as a way to hurt your feelings. No one needs that kind of unnecessary drama.", "I love your dad.", "NTA on my way to work there\u2019s a sign that says \u201cJesus or he!!\u201d I struggle with it because Jesus seems like a good guy but his followers suck! Who do I want to be stuck with for eternity?", "Now you know who your REAL family is. Sending nothing but good vibes.", "Your dad just made me cry.  Thanks dad.", "First off - your husband and your dad sound like wonderful men, and I wish you all the very best! Everyone needs to have at least two ride-or-dies, and you've got them! \n\nSecond, I'm so sorry about your mom's reaction. She may be hurt and upset for the time being, but hopefully she'll come around. Most moms are usually pretty good about letting things go (I know it's not always the case, but I'm hoping it is for you).\n\nThird, the uncles... I'm so glad you and the good tio are on good terms. Hopefully the two of you can continue to bond and strengthen your relationship. As for the rest of them... fuck 'em and good riddance!", "Your dad is great. So is your SO. Things will sort themselves out with your mom. Your bad uncles are going to hell, so that's taken care of.", "Your uncles are just pissed that they didn't get the chance to turn you down.", "WHERE IS THE SIGN UP SHEET FOR YOUR DAD? (I could probably use some abuelita Spanish Side Eye and even a chancla)", "Also big hugs about your mom. I hope *you* have a therapist to talk to, maybe they can also have a session with your dad and you, to talk about what's positive and possible going forward. I'm happy your bi uncle is getting therapy too. Big hugs again young man", "As they\u2019re going to find this post too\u2026 just a few words to your family. \nYou all sound so good good natured all round, that even though you have very different views, it sounds as though they have been addressed in the main with good humour and love\u2026 that you still want to get together as a family, that not being invited has hurt, that falling out has hurt even more. Even though there are problems, you are still much closer than so many other families on this Reddit. \nI\u2019m not going to go on the attack here, but is there any chance you can get together and talk calmly\u2026 uncles, even if you disagree, the lgbt issues aren\u2019t going away, love and celebrate your family as they love you. There\u2019s lots of support out there if you need it. \nDon\u2019t let your family suffer.", "It is wonderful to see his dad support his every move and LOVE his every move!!! It is also probs worth remembering the uncle is very use to horrific behaviour and even tho he doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat, he can\u2019t expect others not to, every action has a reaction! \n\nWe all love you and are so proud of you and from an LGBTQ person to another I think the whole things was STUNNING \ud83e\udd29 \n\nHave a wonderful and healthy future x", "I love this. Exactly!", "There isn't really terribly much to say about the silent witnesses. If anything, the silent witnesses are the reason there is an update post in the first place haha. All the behind the scenes chisme and shit talking lol.", "I just mean that it's nice to remember that your actions and standing up for yourself could be the very thing that gives others who are silently struggling a feeling of solidarity and support.", "Love the postage stamp remark! \n\nYour uncles are pissed because they didn't get an official chance to spurn you? Too bad, soo sad.\n\nYour bi uncle may have lost a brother or two, but he's gaining a new nephew. May your happy family keep growing!", "I\u2019m a little sad your mom took the stance she did. My youngest recently came out and I, with her permission, gave a heads up to my dad and bonus mom. My dad started to say something I thought was going to be negative and I was all kinds of prepared to tell him to think about what he truly wanted to express because I would have no issues cutting him out if I needed to.", "I\u2019m glad you worked it out with the uncle that matters.  Your dad is awesome.  Hopefully your mom will come around since your uncles started this mess with being homophobic.  Sometimes you have to point out to your parent that accepting their homophobic behavior does more damage than good.  Hopefully your dad rubs off on her enough to drag her to happy side.", "I love your dad. He knows what's what.\n\nGood for you, kid.", "First, your dad is now my favorite dad, holy crap.  \n\nSecond, I'm sorry about the fight with your mom, but it'll be okay. She sadly showed her true colors, apparently, but hopefully she'll come around.  \n\nThird, HEY BIGOT UNCLES, IF YOU SEE THIS, YOU SUCK and I'm gonna kiss my partner in your honor (both of us are bi and nonbinary).  \n\nAnd lastly, you did absolutely nothing wrong. Anyone who thinks you should be quiet to not ruffle bigot feathers isn't someone who you need in your life. Take time to heal, and if you're able, therapy could help you work through the emotions with you and your mom's fight.  \n\nGive your husband and dad a hug, and your bi uncle, cry on their shoulders, let yourself mourn and feel what you have to. Just know that it'll be okay eventually. Sometimes, it takes time, but it'll work out. All the love to you and your awesome family members.", "You've got a good dad - your bigoted uncles can go hem a hanky. I hope they see that lol!!!", "'We want to be bigoted, we just don't want to be called bigoted.' SMH", ">It took 2 of us to make you, and I gotta say I love my work.

You are telling them the truth. They don't like what it looks like. They need to change the way they behave then. Keep telling them the truth. I'm sorry your mom doesn't place the blame on the Uncles that started the conversation. They asked a question and didn't like the truth. You didn't start the fight. You just didn't lie to anyone. I love the that you told them they weren't worth the cost of postage! I laughed hard at that!", "It's so good to see dad stick up for the lgbtq kid usually it's the mom and not the dad and he seems so proud of you", "NTA.\n\nYour wedding, your choice!", "I hope your family all read this update. Way to go, husband, dad, and bi- uncle!!!! Way to go you, for talking it out with your bi uncle and sharing your point of view in a way that doesn't judge him. Everyone else sucks. Uncles just wanted the satisfaction of turning down the invite and talking to each other about how you're \"going to hell\".  Maybe mom has always been more ambivalent than actively supportive, and this gathering triggered her to express anger at you, perhaps anger at your being \"different\" rather than at \"ruining\" her gathering. Hopefully when she cools down you two can have a frank talk about how she truly feels. Even if her response on her true beliefs makes one or both of you uncomfortable, at least you'd know. Her continuing to avoid the topic could indicate that she doesn't want to face her true beliefs on the topic.", "Give your ma time. She's now hearing what it sounds like a nonstop earful from her brother. Let it blow over and I'm sure you guys will be fine. Sounds like she's just caught in the middle and handling it poorly.", "I think it\u2019s hilarious that the uncles are upset about being painted in that light in a fairly anonymous setting but have no problem attaching their names to their beliefs on their personal social media which has a far more likely chance of people they actually know judging them! \ud83d\ude02 OP I\u2019m sorry you aren\u2019t getting the supportive response you deserve and thought you might get from your mom, but your dad sounds like an amazing parent and a great support. He sounds like someone who should be out at Pride events giving \u201cdad hugs\u201d to those who need it! And I\u2019m also glad your husband has your back in all this!", "All I got out of this is she\u2019s Daddy\u2019s little girl.", "> ...they really have no room to feel any sort of way about your use of social media.\n\nPersonally I think they should feel shitty as their hypocrisy is exposed undeniably to them.", "I always love it when they say things like \u201chow dare you say all that stuff about us and make us look bad?\u201d When the only things said were 100% the truth. They just wanted to, ironically, keep it in the closet.", "And dad!! Don\u2019t forget dad!", "There is no woman being discussed here outside of the mother.", ">\u201dAll I got out of this is she\u2019s Daddy\u2019s little girl.\u201d\n\nAs the post is written by a gay man, talking about his wedding to another gay man - you either didn\u2019t bother reading it properly or you\u2019re making a homophobic comment about how gay men who have loving relationships with their fathers must be \u201clittle girls.\u201d\n\nWhich is it?"]}
