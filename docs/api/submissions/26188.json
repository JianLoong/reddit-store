I spend the majority of my time with her and usually bring her along to most things I go to. She's a good and peaceful kid. On Friday I went on an overnight getaway. I hadn't done anything by myself in three months. \n\nMy parents are very staunchly against anyone not in our family babysitting/watching their grand daughter. But as a single mom, it's simply not possible. I work at a daycare center so I am with her pretty much all day. But when she starts school very soon its just something that will end up happening. If I've ever hired a baby sitter they are extremely upset. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had this planned out 2 weeks in advance and asked my parents first thing if they could watch my daughter overnight. They said they were busy and would be seeing a stand up comedian and probably a movie over the weekend. So I asked my brother and sister and both of them were busy as well. So I asked my best friend(30f) who also has kids. I trust her. Also my kid is friends with her kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell the day came and my parents were texting and calling. I was at work and couldn't answer. After work I called back and they were like \"so who is watching her?\" They had called/texted my siblings to see if they were going to watch her. I told my parents that my best friend is watching her. This caused them to flip out saying that you can't leave her with strangers. I said that this \"stranger\" is my best friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey realized I wasn't budging and dropped it. Then when I was on the way to the getaway. I get a text from my mom saying \"we're picking her up, thanks for forcing us to do this.\" So they cancelled their plans and picked up my daughter and watched her until I got back.

(Side note: Your daughter, trumps \"their granddaughter\").  I'd be asking the friend more often, and sharing sleepovers/playdates - the kids would all be happy and it would give each of you the night off.  Tell your parents to mind their own business, and ask your friend to not let your parents in, should they be so rude as to turn up.  Also, maybe you could limit the amount of information you share with your parents?", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds like your parents are perhaps a bit too involved in your parenting (probably out of necessity when you were younger). \n\nIt's time for you to enforce some boundaries and assert yourself as the parent.", "NTA but why are you allowing your parents to make parenting decisions for you?", "NTA You're 28. Your parents have no say in your parenting choices. And to go take your daughter without your permission? Technically that is kidnapping.", "NTA. Your parents essentially kidnapped your daughter.", "NTA, 100%, you choose who watches your kid, not them. If they disagree with your decisions, that does not mean you're forcing them to do anything. They could just... not cancel their plans.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Did you parents show up at your place uninvited, while your friend was babysitting your kid, and demand that she leave so that they can be there instead? Do I understand this right?", "If your best friend was a \"stranger\" in their view, how did they know where to pick her up?", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nIt's unfortunate, but you may need to assertively share less information with them.\n\nExamples:\n\n\"Who is babysitting her?\"  \"I've made arrangements for her childcare.\"\n\n\"Yes, but who?\"  \"Don't worry.  I've made arrangements for her childcare.\"\n\n\"Yes, but who?\"  \"I've shared the details of my childcare arrangements with those who are involved in those arrangements.

Are they going to school with her too?", "NTA. It sounds like your parents kidnapped your child.", "NTA, but your parents are.

The only person who gets to decide who looks after your child, is you.", "NTA. I had to reread this thinking, surely the. parents are financially supporting OP, because why else could they have the power to overrule her child care decisions? Turns out they're just overbearing.", "If I were your friend I would not have allowed them to take her. She isn\u2019t the parent, you are. You made arrangements for her care, they had zero right to barge in and take your child.

Frankly id have not let her leave with them and called you. \n\n\nNTA for this but YWBTA if you don\u2019t stomp this out NOW. They aren\u2019t the parents, they have no rights, they shouldn\u2019t be taking your child anywhere without your permission. You owe your friend a massive apology for wasting her time and putting her in the middle. You should also tell her that unless YOU give permission for your child to leave or change plans that she stays put. This is a major safety issue. Will your parents try to remove her from school, from after school clubs, from a sleepover at a friends house because they decided they don\u2019t want her there? Enough is enough.", "NTA. That was ridiculous and dramatic on their part. Also highly insulting to you (as if saying you don't have the sense to pick decent friends and read if they are responsible or not.)", "NTA and it is really crazy you are letting them parent your child over your own wishes. They don't treat you like an adult who can make her own decisions. For your kiddo you need to start telling them that you are the parent and as such you are able to make those decisions. \n\nAnd don't feel bad about them cancelling their plans. They did that on your own. You made acceptable plans for your child. They freaked out and acted on it.", "NTA - but you did not 'force' them to pick her up and actually you should have told them NOT to pick her up.

They did not have your permission to pick her up either so they basically kidnapped your child.\n\nThe power move you need to make here is to put your foot down and tell them they do NOT get to dictate who watches your daughter. You are the mother AND an independent adult - THEY don't get to make these decisions, YOU do. \n\nShine up your spine and good luck!", "NTA. You didn't force them to do anything. You arranged childcare with someone you trust. Your parents are crazy and overbearing.", "NTA, but why are you letting your parents dictate this?", "They realise that when she start school, her teacher is unlikely to be a family member, right?\nNTA\nThey took it on themselves to collect your daughter. You respected that they said no and made made other reasonable arrangements. That should have been the end of their involvement.", "\"We're picking her up, thanks for forcing us to do this.\"\n\nIf that's not narcissistic behavior right there, I don't know what is.\n\nNTA", "NTA none of their business who watches YOUR child", "Your parents are way way out of line  Nta and they are", "NTA. There's clearly something wrong with them.", "NTA - It's your kid, not theirs. You didn't \"force\" them to pick her up. You made arrangements that you were safe with.

She\u2019s YOUR daughter and you decide what\u2019s best for her.", "YTA for allowing anyone who thinks that their opinions outweigh yours to care for your child. Your parents will override you on anything because they believe that you are an unfit mother. They just told you that.  What else will they override because you are unfit?", "NTA, but I'm not sure you're concerned enough about your parents' behavior. They took your daughter from your friend's house without your permission! This is a big deal!

It\u2019s not ok that they changed your plans without checking with you, it\u2019s not ok that they bothered your friend and put her in a very weird position, and it\u2019s not ok that they tried to place blame on you. All of that can\u2019t happen again. They don\u2019t get to choose who can watch her. They don\u2019t get to pick her up/change your arrangements without asking you first.

Your mom sounds psychotic. Personally I'd have not let her pick her up.", "NTA  \n\nSo they basically kidnapped your daughter from where you had entrusted her and they're mat at you?   \ne\nThey're overprotective to the point of committing a felony.\n\nYou need to clue them in on boundaries and how to keep them.", "You\u2019re unintentionally bringing this upon yourself.

That\u2019s a line that cannot be crossed.  EVER.  Warn them now that if they ever do that again, you\u2019ll call the police and report a kidnapping.

NTA at all.", "NTA, your mom needs to mind her own business.", "The grandparents do not want anyone but family watching the kid, but when asked to do so, they said no.

Everything they did, they *chose to do*. You did not force a single action from them.

In addition, I would personally be absolutely furious if they stuck their noses in my plans and unilaterally canceled the arrangements I made for MY kid. If someone took it upon themself to pack up my kid and take her someplace that I didn\u2019t plan for her, they wouldn\u2019t see my kid until some serious boundaries were explained and enforced.

I would say that whoever is behind not wanting her to be watched by anyone not in the family could maybe do it some therapy to see what's behind it, because your kid is going to be watched by non-relatives like teachers all through her childhood.

I spend the majority of my time with her and usually bring her along to most things I go to. She's a good and peaceful kid. On Friday I went on an overnight getaway. I hadn't done anything by myself in three months. \n\nMy parents are very staunchly against anyone not in our family babysitting/watching their grand daughter. But as a single mom, it's simply not possible. I work at a daycare center so I am with her pretty much all day. But when she starts school very soon its just something that will end up happening. If I've ever hired a baby sitter they are extremely upset. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had this planned out 2 weeks in advance and asked my parents first thing if they could watch my daughter overnight. They said they were busy and would be seeing a stand up comedian and probably a movie over the weekend. So I asked my brother and sister and both of them were busy as well. So I asked my best friend(30f) who also has kids. I trust her. Also my kid is friends with her kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell the day came and my parents were texting and calling. I was at work and couldn't answer. After work I called back and they were like \"so who is watching her?\" They had called/texted my siblings to see if they were going to watch her. I told my parents that my best friend is watching her. This caused them to flip out saying that you can't leave her with strangers. I said that this \"stranger\" is my best friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey realized I wasn't budging and dropped it. Then when I was on the way to the getaway. I get a text from my mom saying \"we're picking her up, thanks for forcing us to do this.\" So they cancelled their plans and picked up my daughter and watched her until I got back. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
