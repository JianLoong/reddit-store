The invites were all sent months ago. I come from a big family. My mom is 1 of 6. I did not invite her sister, my aunt N (F 50s?) She is the only family member we did not invite.\n\nMy Aunt N & I have a very complicated history. We were very close when I was younger.  She was the crazy unpredictable aunt that would let us buy and do anything we wanted. As I got older I started realizing my parents probably shouldn\u2019t have trusted her with us in her care. She will do anything for attention. She\u2019s a compulsive liar. And many other things (character limit) Then in HS she kidnapped me in the disguise of a California weekend trip, & held me from ransom against my parents. When I gave her a second chance in college she kicked me out onto the street, leading to me being homeless for over a month in a state where I had no family besides her to turn to for help. For me, that was my last straw. \n\nAfter that she tried her behavior on to my other cousins, (theres 11 of us) keeping the cycle of trying to be the cool aunt. Then when she would over step, people got mad, & she got defensive & did something crazy. A few times worse than what she did to me.  Since then, one of my uncles allegedly got a restraining order against her. She is not allowed near any of his children.\n\nSo tonight she called my mom trying to really butter her up with a sob story (for 30 + min) before begging for a invite. My mom told her she would have to talk to me directly, because it\u2019s my wedding. To that, aunt N said \u201cwell arnt you paying for it? You should invite who you want.\u201d Which my mom responded with, no, they are paying for the wedding 100% theirselves (something I\u2019m v proud of btw. Yay us!) Aunt N was flabbergasted to say the least. She thought my parents paying for it would be her ticket in, if she could guilt trip them enough.\n\nWhen my mom was summarizing this us my dad was also in the room. He insisted that saying no to her will not work. That she will try to show up and act like she was invited. I told him that if she decides to arrive, she will promptly be escorted off the property. I don\u2019t want her there. My husband 100000% supports my decision. Also my uncle with the restraining order will be there with his kids. So legally, she can\u2019t. My dad said \u201cyou should take the higher ground. It will ruin your day if you let her get to you. Just let her do her thing. I should ignore her & enjoy my day.\n\nI said, having an unwanted guest will ruin my day. Not asking someone to leave. He leaned into it, saying that it is in bad taste. I asked him if I should just let any random person that didn\u2019t get an invite attend. he said that\u2019s different. She\u2019s family.\n\nWe went back & forth for a good 15 minutes about this. When he left we were still not in agreement. He thinks IATA for not letting her stay if she intrudes and not taking the high ground. I can\u2019t stop thinking about this and am now starting to question my boundaries.

And maybe I don't know the details of how a restraining order works but, if the uncle is present, she CANNOT be without being in violation of the order, right? \n\nSadly, I think you do need to hire a security service for this event. It sounds like it would be very, very problematic if she shows up, and it's not going to come down to whether she received an invitation or not. This is not about ruining or embarrassing her, it's about holding onto the boundaries your entire family needs against her.", "NTA\n\nLike WTF.

It sounds like legally she can\u2019t attend anyway because of the court order with your uncle.", "NTA. \n\nMaybe just say to your dad that you would hope that aunt would have the basic courtesy not to show up uninvited, as that really would be in bad taste, and that of course, you would prefer not to have to expressly tell her that she will be told to leave if she does show up, but if she is so lost to all sense of taste that she shows up despite being told she is not invited then unfortunately , she will have brought any consequential embarrassment on herself.\n\nPerhaps also say that what would spoil your day would be having her there, given her track record, and worrying about her showing up, and also if you felt that your parents were unable to respect the decision you have made. \n\nThe good news is that you don't have to agree. It's your wedding, you and your fianc\u00e9 have made a decision.\n\nIf you speak to her directly, I would keep it brief.

Your dad's opinion is wrong and dangerous and as you said, your uncle has a RO against her so he clearly doesn't want her around and might kick her out regardless of others. Your wedding. Your dime.

Stick to your guns and have a great wedding.", "NTA and I\u2019m flabbergasted this is even a question.\n\nShe *kidnapped* you. How is she not in prison? Restraining orders? Leaving you homeless after you unfathomably gave her another chance? Manipulation and abuse? Why does you dad think *any of this* is okay?", "You said your husband supports you on this but I thought you weren't married yet?\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but I want to caveat something that most people misunderstand about restraining orders (assuming you're in the U.S.).  If you had invited aunt, the restraining order would not prevent either aunt nor uncle from attending.  Restraining order does not mean that one person gets kicked out of a place they are otherwise legally allowed to be unless they're harassing the person.  Aunt cannot go to uncles home or work, but she can be in a grocery store or your wedding with him as long as she doesn't attempt to approach or talk to him.\n\nMy husband's ex has taken out a restraining order on him, some of our friends asked him to leave public gatherings because of it.  But when ex tried to actually call the police she was livid cause the police refused to force him to leave a park, they said, its a public place and if he's not trying to approach you he isn't doing anything wrong.", "NTA \n\nThis woman clearly sounds dangerous and manipulative. Just because she is family, doesn't mean she has a right to do whatever she wants and just because she is family it doesn't mean you can just 'ignore' her actions and 'be the better person'. I'm totally surprised why she isn't in prison or why she is still allowed to contact you and your family after that kidnap story!\n\nDon't think too much, you are just being reasonable. I can guarantee 100%, if she does attend your wedding, she will do something stupid to attract attention to ruin your day. So don't think too much.\n\nCongratulations for the wedding and all the best for your future xx Hope your wedding day ends up better than your expectations xx", "NTA.  dad is \ud83d\udcaf  wrong.  Who gives a shit if she's related.\nYou can invite 50 strangers if you want.\nIt's YOUR wedding.", "Why is your dad defending her?? It's not even his sister. \n\nNTA, hire a bouncer.

You know yourself and what would make you feel worse: 15 minutes of awkwardness/even \"a scene\" if she is escorted out or having to see your aunt for your entire wedding.

The restraining order trumps all of your dad's etiquette preferences. Her behavior became so threatening at some point that a law enforcement agency placed a restraining order on her.

NTA.", "Hell no - NTA.. keep her away whatever it costs for security.. just get someone in on \u201cinterference\u201d to eject her if she turns up .. she sounds unhinged enough to turn the wedding into smth about her ..", "Stick to your gut. Why should you ruin your event so she can do her thing? That\u2019s crazy? Notify the venue and wedding party. I\u2019d also get a restraining order and tell them she\u2019s been verbally abusive and saying she\u2019s going to ruin your wedding.", "I\u2019m sorry, she RANSOMED YOU to your parents, father includes, and now he wants her to go to your wedding against your will?\n\nNTA. Tell dad to stay home with your aunt if he\u2019s that stuck on the idea.", "NTA- this woman KIDNAPPED you, held you for ransom, emotionally abused you and your dad thinks you should take the higher ground? He should have stood any ground and made sure you were protected against her. Your fiance agrees with you. You two are paying for it. I'd have security on standby", "NTA\n\nHave you considered asking a few friends to be on the lookout for her?  And if she shows up, they can escort her from the property and call the police without making you deal with it?", "NTA\n\nMake certain you have security and they have pictures of your aunt.  \n\nHand out pretty engraved invitations to the actual invitees.  Check  IDs at the door.   It's a private party.  Treat it as such.  \n\nCongratulations!!\n\nBTW - your father is wrong.", "NTA- Hire security and do not invite her. Also, not trying to be rude but your dad isn't paying for anything, so was is he trying to call the shots here?", "NTA, your dad's spineless, though your uncle who is invited has a restraining order against her. Does your dad not think just letting her attend will cause problems with your uncle and his kids?", "I am genuinely so confused as to why anyone in the family is even still speaking to this aunt considering her past behavior. Not inviting her is not in poor taste. In fact, it demonstrates that you care about your guests, your family members, you know, the ones who haven\u2019t kidnapped their siblings children for ransom. \n\nYour parents are enabling her by even speaking to her or considering what she wants. god forbid she use this opportunity to strike again. NTA.", "OP, you don't need to be in agreement with your dad. It's your wedding, he's not paying for it, he doesn't need to approve.\n\nThat said, sounds like her showing up is likely so you better have some people ready to provide security.", "Typically, its the best man's job to keep order, thats literally his function. In the past, Best Men were armed.", "Yeah, this is a weird stand for the dad to take. It's not even his sister.", "Imaging your dad not taking your side when you're saying you dont want the person who made you homeless for a month at your wedding ?  \nBeing a blood relative doesnt make her family and by the looks of the story many of her blood relatives dont want her in the family", "Probably which is why uncle should be notified so he can be prepared for the likely drama (and maybe have a copy of the order if needed)", ">*You do want an actual security guard*.\n\nChiming in.\n\nnta", "In my state, if your wedding/reception includes alcohol, there needs to be 1 police officer (on or off duty) for every 50 people. Just ask for the buffest cops \ud83d\ude43", "This is fucked up.", "My dear, you should process these events with an objective source. Your parents have downplayed these seriously dangerous and deranged behaviors, and that has clearly influenced you. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing casual about tricking a kid into coming somewhere with you, only to call the parents and demand money for your safety. By downplaying her behaviors, they\u2019re enabling her, facilitating even, and their advice regarding her should be taken with a grain of salt.", "A crazy aunt who's going to sue ANYONE that touches her? Best man is not going to cut it.", "No, dad is right, definitely take the higher ground. It\u2019s better for repelling barbarians, unstable aunts and other invaders.", "your family's weakness isn't that they're too nice to realize they're being taken advantage of. their weakness is that they're cowards. they're so afraid of confrontation they'd rather enable ppl to abuse their children than deal with the fallout of cutting them off.", "A copy of the order is a great idea!", "\\^\\^ This, and they should have her picture and you should be no where near her or speak to her or let family drag you into drama", "Depends on the jurisdiction.  We had zero cops at our nearly 200 person (big family) wedding.  The hotel we held it at never said anything about security", "Holy shit, your state must've had some insane weddings for this to be enforced.", "Let me guess, New Jersey?"]}
