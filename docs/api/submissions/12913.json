The invites were all sent months ago. I come from a big family. My mom is 1 of 6. I did not invite her sister, my aunt N (F 50s?) She is the only family member we did not invite.\n\nMy Aunt N & I have a very complicated history. We were very close when I was younger.  She was the crazy unpredictable aunt that would let us buy and do anything we wanted. As I got older I started realizing my parents probably shouldn\u2019t have trusted her with us in her care. She will do anything for attention. She\u2019s a compulsive liar. And many other things (character limit) Then in HS she kidnapped me in the disguise of a California weekend trip, & held me from ransom against my parents. When I gave her a second chance in college she kicked me out onto the street, leading to me being homeless for over a month in a state where I had no family besides her to turn to for help. For me, that was my last straw. \n\nAfter that she tried her behavior on to my other cousins, (theres 11 of us) keeping the cycle of trying to be the cool aunt. Then when she would over step, people got mad, & she got defensive & did something crazy. A few times worse than what she did to me.  Since then, one of my uncles allegedly got a restraining order against her. She is not allowed near any of his children.\n\nSo tonight she called my mom trying to really butter her up with a sob story (for 30 + min) before begging for a invite. My mom told her she would have to talk to me directly, because it\u2019s my wedding. To that, aunt N said \u201cwell arnt you paying for it? You should invite who you want.\u201d Which my mom responded with, no, they are paying for the wedding 100% theirselves (something I\u2019m v proud of btw. Yay us!) Aunt N was flabbergasted to say the least. She thought my parents paying for it would be her ticket in, if she could guilt trip them enough.\n\nWhen my mom was summarizing this us my dad was also in the room. He insisted that saying no to her will not work. That she will try to show up and act like she was invited. I told him that if she decides to arrive, she will promptly be escorted off the property. I don\u2019t want her there. My husband 100000% supports my decision. Also my uncle with the restraining order will be there with his kids. So legally, she can\u2019t. My dad said \u201cyou should take the higher ground. It will ruin your day if you let her get to you. Just let her do her thing. I should ignore her & enjoy my day.\n\nI said, having an unwanted guest will ruin my day. Not asking someone to leave. He leaned into it, saying that it is in bad taste. I asked him if I should just let any random person that didn\u2019t get an invite attend. he said that\u2019s different. She\u2019s family.\n\nWe went back & forth for a good 15 minutes about this. When he left we were still not in agreement. He thinks IATA for not letting her stay if she intrudes and not taking the high ground. I can\u2019t stop thinking about this and am now starting to question my boundaries.

My aunt and I have a rocky history. Most of my family shares the distaste for her. But my dad insists that if she invites herself, it will be in bad taste if I have her removed, and will ruin my day. I don\u2019t believe so. I think having her there will ruin it\u2014- that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t invite her. But he insists that she\u2019s family.

One of the other expected guests has a restraining order against her, which means she legally cannot come to the wedding.", "Definitely NTA. If she shows up and you allow her to stay, your cousins and uncle with the restraining order will have to leave and/or could call the police. I would hire security of some sort to have her escorted it and then try your best to ignore that possibility and enjoy your big day.", "NTA! This woman legitimately sounds DANGEROUS. And maybe I don't know the details of how a restraining order works but, if the uncle is present, she CANNOT be without being in violation of the order, right? \n\nSadly, I think you do need to hire a security service for this event. It sounds like it would be very, very problematic if she shows up, and it's not going to come down to whether she received an invitation or not. This is not about ruining or embarrassing her, it's about holding onto the boundaries your entire family needs against her.", "NTA\n\nLike WTF. Get a restraining order for her, yourself.\n\nYour dad should be in your corner.\n\nAlso speak to local Police about your uncle's restraining order and the possibility that she might show up uninvited. See if they give you any additional options.", "OP, it's your wedding. Have security at the door. NTA", "NTA, and have people on hand to escort her off the property of she does try to attend.", "NTA of course she shouldn't be there. I'd have security warned (with pics) to be on the look out and not admit her", "NTA - stick to you decision and have her removed if she shows up.  As you said, there is a restraining order against her and if she does show up, she can be arrested.", "NTA - She's criminal level crazy, and that restraining order is real. Hire security and give them her photo.", "\"Then in HS she kidnapped me in the disguise of a California weekend trip, & held me from ransom against my parents.\"\n\n...Kinda big detail to gloss over. Why weren't the police alerted, and why in the hell would you even have *any* contact with this individual after?\n\nAnyway your wedding, your rules. Your dad may not like it but it ain't his day. NTA.", "NTA. Your wedding - your guest list. That and paragraph 2 lays out pretty clearly that you are entirely justified in not inviting her. No idea why your dad is making this his hill, but he needs to understand that this isn\u2019t his event, it\u2019s not his choice to make, and he needs to respect yours. \n\nAlso, this is not just about your wedding - it\u2019s about setting boundaries in your marriage and how much you will let your parents interfere.", "NTA - your wedding, your day, your choice. It sounds like legally she can\u2019t attend anyway because of the court order with your uncle.", "NTA. \n\nMaybe just say to your dad that you would hope that aunt would have the basic courtesy not to show up uninvited, as that really would be in bad taste, and that of course, you would prefer not to have to expressly tell her that she will be told to leave if she does show up, but if she is so lost to all sense of taste that she shows up despite being told she is not invited then unfortunately , she will have brought any consequential embarrassment on herself.\n\nPerhaps also say that what would spoil your day would be having her there, given her track record, and worrying about her showing up, and also if you felt that your parents were unable to respect the decision you have made. \n\nThe good news is that you don't have to agree. It's your wedding, you and your fianc\u00e9 have made a decision.\n\nIf you speak to her directly, I would keep it brief. Say that she is not invited, that you are not able to increase the guest list and that while you are sure that she would not be rude enough to show up uninvited, f she were to do so she will be required to leave and, if necessary, escorted off the premises .", "NTA. \n\nIt is your wedding and if you are uncomfortable having a certain guest than that person should not be there. If your parents cant support that than maybe they shouldnt be there either. If having her escorted out is what you want and it wont upset your day than that is what you should do. If there is a restraining order than you could call the local police/sheriff and tell them that there is a chance she will try to break that protection order and they may be able to have someone close by and if not than they will no what is going on if somebody calls them.\n\nThe way your aunt sounds if she shows up she will make a scene about not being invited ECT. I would designate someone to watch the entrance to the venue and make sure she is not able to get in.", "NTA. There is a real chance she might show up anyways though, any idea what you'll do about that?", "NTA. You need to have security on site to prevent her from even getting in.", ">My dad said \u201cyou should take the higher ground. It will ruin your day if you let her get to you. Just let her do her thing. I should ignore her & enjoy my day.\n\nThis is why the aunt keeps pulling the crap she pulls. NTA. \n\n>I said, having an unwanted guest will ruin my day.

I asked him if I should just let any random person that didn\u2019t get an invite attend. he said that\u2019s different. She\u2019s family.\n\nYep. Your parents enable someone that kidnapped you. Absolutely escort her out. Your dad's opinion is wrong and dangerous and as you said, your uncle has a RO against her so he clearly doesn't want her around and might kick her out regardless of others. Your wedding. Your dime. Kick her out.", "Not gonna lie, this sounds laughably Saturday Morning Cartoonish.\n\nLike, why are any of you even speaking to someone who kidnapped you and left you homeless.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nAnd I would confirm if there really is a restraining order.  If there is, tell your mom and dad that if she violates that order, the police WILL be called and she will be arrested, end of discussion.", "NTA.  Your dad is out of line. Aunt is toxic. Stick to your guns and have a great wedding.", "NTA and I\u2019m flabbergasted this is even a question.\n\nShe *kidnapped* you. How is she not in prison? Restraining orders? Leaving you homeless after you unfathomably gave her another chance? Manipulation and abuse? Why does you dad think *any of this* is okay?", "You said your husband supports you on this but I thought you weren't married yet?\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but I want to caveat something that most people misunderstand about restraining orders (assuming you're in the U.S.).  If you had invited aunt, the restraining order would not prevent either aunt nor uncle from attending.  Restraining order does not mean that one person gets kicked out of a place they are otherwise legally allowed to be unless they're harassing the person.  Aunt cannot go to uncles home or work, but she can be in a grocery store or your wedding with him as long as she doesn't attempt to approach or talk to him.\n\nMy husband's ex has taken out a restraining order on him, some of our friends asked him to leave public gatherings because of it.  But when ex tried to actually call the police she was livid cause the police refused to force him to leave a park, they said, its a public place and if he's not trying to approach you he isn't doing anything wrong.", "NTA \n\nThis woman clearly sounds dangerous and manipulative. Just because she is family, doesn't mean she has a right to do whatever she wants and just because she is family it doesn't mean you can just 'ignore' her actions and 'be the better person'. I'm totally surprised why she isn't in prison or why she is still allowed to contact you and your family after that kidnap story!\n\nDon't think too much, you are just being reasonable. I can guarantee 100%, if she does attend your wedding, she will do something stupid to attract attention to ruin your day. So don't think too much.\n\nCongratulations for the wedding and all the best for your future xx Hope your wedding day ends up better than your expectations xx", "NTA.  dad is \ud83d\udcaf  wrong.  Who gives a shit if she's related.\nYou can invite 50 strangers if you want.\nIt's YOUR wedding.", "Why is your dad defending her?? It's not even his sister. \n\nNTA, hire a bouncer. Tell they they have 1 person to look for and they will jump on a contract like that", "NTA - your dad is irresponsible", "NTA\n\nYour father's enabling is exactly how manipulative people can keep coming back. You know yourself and what would make you feel worse: 15 minutes of awkwardness/even \"a scene\" if she is escorted out or having to see your aunt for your entire wedding. If the former is still the better option, it's a no brainer.

Anyhow, the cops will take care of escorting her, given the restraining order situation. Inform her you will ensure a copy of it will be on hand. Hopefully that is enough to dissuade her.", "NTA. The restraining order trumps all of your dad's etiquette preferences. Her behavior became so threatening at some point that a law enforcement agency placed a restraining order on her. She can't legally come near your uncle and you can't ethically put your uncle in that position. Call her and tell her that she'll be violating the restraining order if she appears and that you'll call law enforcement. Then appoint a trusted friend to be in charge of keeping an eye out for her and calling the police. And have mercy on your uncle and let him know the plan- he doesn't deserve to have this hanging over his head. What in the world is your Dad thinking??", "NTA.

You don't want her there, and your uncle has a restraining order.\n\nBut also you were kidnapped and ransomed as a teen??? And your parents are ok with idea of her being at your wedding???

That\u2019s all there needs to be said.\nWouldn\u2019t OP be an accessory if she allowed the aunt to stay?", "Came here to say this. This weeding NEEDS a security guard.

It's a good idea to give law enforcement a head's up when there's a protective order in place with a high chance of violation.
