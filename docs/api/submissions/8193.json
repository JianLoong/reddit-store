A pet is a responsibility and she obviously wasn't caring for it. Literally doing the bare minimum and feeding the cat, and she couldn't even do that?.. You did good on finding someone that would take the cat in and actually care for it.", "NTA. Your sister was neglecting that cat, and it would be cruel and unfair to the cat to keep it there.  It was good you saved it.", "NTA\n\nNormally I would say giving away someone's pet is a definite no-no but it doesn't seem like she is capable of caring for the poor cat, and she seems to have much bigger problems going on than just a cat.\n\nWhat was her reaction?

All it takes is a phone call from a well meaning neighbor and you guys will no longer have control of the situation. If she's intentionally living in a garbage pile full of cockroaches, she's a danger to herself at this point. \n\nHonestly, it may have come to the point where inpatient treatment needs to be considered. If she does inpatient treatment then there will be medical staff that can at least make sure she is living in clean, safe conditions. \n\nIf I were you, I would disengage from this situation.

It absolutely sucks that she\u2019s lost her one emotional connection, but she would have been without a cat anyway when the cat died, which sounds likely.  \nAny chance your friend would let her visit the cat?  Could be a good way to motivate her to get up and bathed/dressed, so she can make these visits.", "NTA. Thank you for saving the cat.", "NTA. The cat was being neglected by her.

She needs immediate help.\n\nNTA btw", "NTA.\n\nYour family is upset about you taking the cat, but it would appear that your sister doesn't care.  She was probably letting it out to reduce the kitty litter demand, or to let it \"fend for itself.\"  Regardless, the cat needed attention.\n\nThe cat was outside and obviously underfed.  The neighbors could easily have taken it to Animal Control.\n\nMy only suggestion would be that your friend \"foster\" instead of \"adopt\" the cat in the short term, in case your sister improves and does want her cat back.", "NTA , You saved the poor kitty. The cat would have died if you left him with your sister. He's a living being,  not an inanimate object.", "NTA.  This is equivalent to masks on an airplane - you have to secure yourself with one before helping others.  She is not in a place right now where she can even take care of herself, and clearly she is not caring for the cat either. It would have been cruel to leave him there, so you were right to do her this kindness.  Depression or not, you don\u2019t get to be selfish when it results in you neglecting the health of another living being.  Having sympathy for her doesn\u2019t mean you have to let a cat waste away.  I honestly would even remove a cat from a stressful situation, and this is far worse than that.\n\nYou may want to speak to your friend, though.  Explain the situation and ask if they may be OK with fostering, in case your sister wants to have the cat back when she is better. But this is optional.  If the cat is thriving there, that might be what\u2019s best for him.", "NTA for saving the cat. \nYTA for throwing her failure in her face in such a demeaning way as taking her cat and giving it to someone else.", "ESH\n\nI think you did the right thing for the cat, but should have presented it to friend as fostering rather than adopting. If your sister wants her cat back, she will have good cause. You stole her cat (that she was neglecting).\n\nShe is clearly doing wrong by the animal. Good on you for helping. Your friend who \u201cadopted\u201d this cat may lose it if contested. I\u2019d just be worried about that.", "ESH\n\nIf the cat was neglected, the right thing to do would have been to call animal protection services. You stole it. It's theft, no matter how well-intended your actions are. You certainly didn't have the right to give it away. That, if nothing else, was one step too far.\n\nIf you think your sister mistreated it, you needed to report it to the authorities. Nothing more, nothing less.", "NTA  - OP you may need to call-in a health check because your sister's condition appears to be declining and she may qualify for a SMI designation (Serious Mental Illness). If you did not re-home the cat it would die or animal protection services would need to get involved which leads to euthanasia in many cities.  Some post say you should have requested the friend to foster the cat...that may be true in a perfect world but most of these scenarios are far from perfect. \n\nWhile you worry and 'check on' you sister be sure to take care of yourself. What you are observing is not normal healthy living. Many state behavioral healthcare hospitals have out patient or inpatient care. If she is not functioning well over 6 months it is time for a different care approach.", "I was all set to call you an AH based on the title, but no. You're not. Good job trying to care for the cat. NTA.", "NTA\n\nThe title prepared me for YTA but yeah you were right to save that poor thing.", "NTA", "NTA. Thank you for saving the cat.", "NTA\n\nAssuming the extent of abuse to animal is accurate. The alternative to taking the animal was to let it die or have the cops take it. Maybe there could have been something where you got a hoppers for food and water that would last a week along with an automatic litter box. I don't know it's not a good situation.\n\nIdeally you or someone could foster the cat until she gets better. When she gets better she is going to want that cat back and probably won't be able to get it from the friend that adopted it. It's kinda a mess legally in my opinion how things went down.", "As someone who also has pretty bad depression NTA at all!", "NTA She was killing an innocent cat causing it so much pain from starving. You did good for the cat but you need to have animals shelters know what she did to this innocent cat. She needs to have animals protected from her so they won\u2019t starve to death or die from neglect. Bring mentally ill dies not mean she gets to starve animals to death. She failed to take care of the cat so it went to somewhere it will be taken care of.", "NTA. Neglect is neglect. Regardless of how it happens. The cat needs the best possible care, just like ur sis. Best to all.", "That was a hard choice.   But what if the cat had died because your sister wasn't feeding it.   She might have harmed herself out of guilt.    You didn't do it to be mean, you did it to be kind.  Please keep trying to help her, your trying to be a good brother and it shows.", "NTA", "If she gets another one call the police OP. And take pictures of the state of the other cat for proof.", "INFO how long did it take your sister to notice the cat was gone? I only ask because you say your family freaked out after YOU told them you took it, not her. I think you\u2019re in the right 100000% and that cat deserved better. She can have an emotional support stuffed cat with all the effort she puts into it.", "That poor, poor kitty. Emotional support animals \"work\" by providing their human with companionship and someone to love and care for. It looks like your sister did none of those things; instead, she unleashed her depression on a poor, defenceless animal. You did the right thing, OP. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYeah, y'know, my cats are really great for my mental health.  You know what I do for them?  *Everything.*  Because I'm responsible for them!\n\nThis isn't a stuffed animal, it's a living, breathing, feeling creature.\n\nAbsolute bare-ass minimum is providing food and water!  She's not even doing *that.*  The cat does not owe it to her to starve and die because she'll be *sad* if someone else is *actually taking care of him* as your family seems to think.  You don't owe it to her to sit back and watch the cat die.  Cats get very sick very quickly when going without food as it sounds like this cat was, it damages their livers.  Cats, and male cats in particular are especially vulnerable to dehydration, too.\n\nIf she's in such bad shape that she can't take care of herself or handle even the absolute most *basic* aspects of pet care, then she needs to not have a pet.  For a lot of people who are struggling, caring for an animal can be what gets them up in the morning.  But for your sister right now, it's just one more overwhelming task she doesn't have the energy for.  That's not good for either of them.  But it will kill the cat.\n\nYou did the right thing.  Please have your friend who took him in get him checked out by a vet to ascertain his condition and needs ASAP.", "ESH.", "So you stole your sick sisters cat, who is important to her emotional support, and gave it away to someone else? \n\nYTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Important info: Our parents send money to her for therapy, but she can't get better cause she make no effort. I know it's hard to someone in this situation, but i couldn't see her cat die for negligence.\n\nThis is also just horrible. You have no idea what's going on in her head and therapy often doesn't work at all even if you're going and trying.  There is no guaranteed cure for mental illness no matter how good someone's intentions are.", "YTA. Ok. You probably saved the cat. Great move. I understand where you're coming from. But taking it without telling her or asking for her permission is really questionable. And you definitely need to educate yourself on depression. Blaming her for the mess she lives in is definitely not going to help. You are very judgmental and clearly don't know anything about mental health. You're probably sad to see her like that and mad you can't really do anything to help her but that's absolutely not the right way to handle this situation", "INFO - did she even realize the cat was not coming around anymore?", "Killing an animal cannot make aomeone feel better. Hope OP took pics of the cat at his lowest.", "The sister's health condition has rendered her incapable of providing a non-infested, safe home with daily food and clean water. How did OP ' throw this in her face'?  The cat was removed and placed.  You prefer the cat be euthanized and not housed?", "There was no other option for the poster. Their sister was killing an innocent creature. As a pet owner people are responsible for its well being and feeding it well. She failed to do that so the cat went to a safe place where it will not starve to death or die from something else from neglect.", "Animal protection services would have confiscated the cat and put it down.", "Hi, cat owner here. \n\nI don't care about whatever issues the sister is going through, thats no excuse to abuse and starve a living creature. The cat was not being well taken care of. Thats animal abuse. Neglect is abuse. If the sister can't take care of the cat, she shouldn't have it. Its a pretty simple thing.", "I never said the cat shouldn't be treated better, or that the family or friends couldnt step up to make that happen.  Taking a support animal away from a mentally ill person, without their knowledge, and giving it away, and then giving the impression you think their either faking their illness or its their fault for not trying is a brutal look.\n\nI care a LOT more about this human in need then I do a cat and I've had lots of cats in my life.  This human that is living in a cockroach filled home barely able to take care of themselves.  The priority being the cat isn't right.", "Two things can be true at once. The human needs support and help. The cat is starving. The cat not starving is an easier fix.\n\nLike it sounds like you are saying that since the person has the cat, and they have issues, its ok to let the cat suffer and starve. It is not. An animal is not a support animal if its missing fur and starving. It is never ok to treat another living being that way regardless of excuse."]}
