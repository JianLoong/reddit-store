Helping your siblings directly will also help your parents indirectly.

You did not magically go from twelve to eighteen, this is no surprise, either.\n\nInstead of them ignoring the ticking clock, they should have asked you what your plans were for when you turned eighteen, not pretend you were going to live there for the rest of your life and never do anything for yourself. They should have been the ones to arrange a talk with you, not the other way around.\n\nThese are their children, not yours. How are you supporting the entire family when your parents don't work? If you can do that, AND go to high school, they will do even better, if ONE of them works full time, I'm sure.

Your parents will likely tell him the same thing, but will probably drain it as soon as it starts hitting a good amount. Or taking 'bits' saying it will be paid back. They will convince him you want to use it to party. Talk to him before they do.

That being said, Ill need my own fort eventually so I'll be making plans, delegating a lot and I'll be damn sure to make my parents and Ollie pull their weight if they aren't.

Looking into a different career is absolutely an option for me, but these other comments are making me realise that it might be time to choose for myself for once.\n\nI appreciate the input nevertheless, and while you are right, I could start later professionally, I think Ollie might be right.

They now see your money as something they're entitled to, and you're 100% right in letting them know it's not. Did they think you'd support them forever? Did they think you'd slave away to provide for 7 people indefinitely until they felt ready to go back to work? I imagine you're afraid for your remaining siblings, but your parents need to understand they have an obligation to provide. And you have the right to invest in yourself without guilt.

Thus, we have decided to go to our pastor.\n\nHe is the most tolerant, kind and generous man we know and we know without a doubt that he can help us figure this out. He was the one I went to when childcare for Eli would fall through last year and who checked up on us everyday and brough groceries when we had COVID (we didn't even have to pay him back).\n\nHe is also a qualified childcare worker and is the one who got us out of the system when it got too far.\n\nShame got in my way and I never wanted to believe it had to go this far but all these replies have showed me and Ollie that what we and Mike went through was more then just a situation, and while this is one of the most difficult decisions I've made in my life, it's time I stop relying on myself and stop believing in my parents. It won;t take me anywhere. We need help and We are asking for it as soon as the sun comes up.\n\nI would have never gotten to this point if it wasn't for all the replies here. If it wasn't for you.
