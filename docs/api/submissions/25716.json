While both of them had jobs there were just too many kids to support. We lived on noodles and handouts from our church and they never really had enough to save. Both me and my older brother Mike started working as soon as we could to support them and to save for our futures as we both wanted to get into uni. We provided the money for food while our parents earned just enough to afford the rest.\n\nLast year Mike died in a car accident. The loss hit everyone incredibly hard and even Eli (2M) could feel the air of grief in our house. It was especially hard for my parents. The grief completely consumed them. They both lost their jobs and fell into a deep depression. They barely got out of bed, and even stopped playing with Eli  and Charlie (5F). This meant that everything fell on me. The unemployment benefits and the bit of childcare money provided by our government were by far not enough to support a family of 7. I had to juggle 2 jobs on top of caring for all of my siblings and finishing my final year of high school. It was hard but I did it.\n\nAfter this break I am starting at uni which means I will be moving away and I need the money previously spent on caring for my family to get housing and pay off some loans (I got a partial scholarship). So, this week I sat my parents down and explained that they have 6 weeks to find jobs as I will not be able to support them and go to uni at the same time. They got incredibly angry, saying that I should have told them sooner and that I can't expect them to stop grieving. I yelled back that they can't just disappear into their grief for one child as they have 5 other children that need their help. The fight ended with me calling them selfish and terrible parents before storming out.\n\nI've been sleeping on my friend's sofa this week and have only been back home twice to check up on my siblings. My brother Ollie (15M) has taken over caring for our siblings and now I truly feel like an asshole. I'm not sure if I can count on my parents to get a job in such a small amount of time and to not just start leaning on Ollie. He said that I made the right decision by applying for uni but that I should have told them earlier so they had more time to prepare for me leaving and that I definitely should not have yelled at them like that and called them terrible parents. He also called me crazy for suggesting to move my spot to next year (that is possible at my uni) and to help my family out for another year saying that if I did that, I would never actually make myself go to uni.\n\nWould I be the asshole for spending the money I previously used to provide for my family on uni, and in doing so potentially shifting my current responsibilities to my younger brother instead of helping them out for another year? and Am I the asshole for yelling at my parents like that?", "created_utc": 1693229370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163m5p6/wibta_for_spending_the_money_i_previously_used_to/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Grief is hard, but they have children to take care of.\n\nYou are not the asshole.\n\nDon\u2019t let them make you feel guilty. You should never have needed to contribute or raise your brothers and sisters in the first place. They should be letting you grieve because you lost your brother.\n\nSorry for you loss and everything that has happened since. Best of luck at university!", "NTA. Ollie is just regurgitating the imaginary grievances that your parents have been feeding him for the past week. You were absolutely right that they're acting selfish. It's funny how they've expected you to work through the past year even though you've been grieving the loss of a brother, but they can't be bothered to lift a finger to support their 5 kids a year later. All that money you've been plowing into the family should have been going into your uni fund so that you wouldn't have had to get loans to begin with. It's long past time that your parents started taking care of their children instead of expecting their children to take care of them.", "Your parents have 4 living children at this point. \n\nYou\u2019re 18. Your brother is 15. They\u2019ve struggled for years and they still chose to have more children who are now 2 and 5?  That\u2019s incredibly irresponsible. \n\nNTA. You\u2019ve don\u2019t your part and they need to figure out how to support their family. You can send money back if you can, but you\u2019re under no obligation to suffer for your parents\u2019 irresponsible behavior.\n\nThat being said, you can always help your siblings directly if you have extra money that you want to spend on them if your parents continue to be selfish.  Helping your siblings directly will also help your parents indirectly. New shoes, new school clothes, school supplies, etc.  Maybe take the sibling out for a nice meal, a movie, or a day at the park to get them away from the parents and see what\u2019s going on. \n\nYou are NTA here. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve known for a long time that you planned to go to university. I\u2019m sure they also knew that you were graduating. They should have been preparing for this and while the loss of your brother is awful, life can\u2019t just stop after a tragedy, especially when other lives depend on them. \n\nMaybe after university and a better job, you can help out more, but there\u2019s no reason you should miss out on this opportunity to make all of your lives better in the future just to make theirs slightly more bearable for now.", ">I can't expect them to stop grieving\n\nReally? Your **brother** died and *you* managed to go to work - what's stopping your parents from doing the same so they can support their family? \n\nYour parents aren't blind or stupid, they've known you were graduating and planning to go to uni. There's no surprise, just their hope that you'd put off your goals to continue supporting the family.\n\nYou can continue having a meager impact on your siblings' well-being by working hard and contributing to the family what little you get . . . or you can go to uni and immeasurably increase the positive impact you have by lifting yourself up.\n\nNTA.", "No. You are not responsible for your parents at all. Literally all you can do is offer your siblings a safe place to stay if you can. Maybe find a cheap two bedroom you can rent or a larger apartment so you can rent extra rooms out and have a guest room for your siblings if they need it. NTA. Go to college please. You have done far more than was ever required of you", "NTA, no.\n\nParents should want their kids to go off on their own and become adults.  Your parents need to \"man up\" and remember that they have 5 other kids to raise and provide for.\n\nGo to school and get your degree.", "NTA \n\nYour parents need a wake up call and need to start providing for their children. They should never have put you in that position to begin with and you need to start living life for you.\n\nParentification is a terrible thing.", "NTA. You need to get yourself out of this situation. Your parents have selfishly continued to have children they can\u2019t afford, while expecting others to provide for those children. Is there a child services agency you can speak to about your concerns?", "Your parents are assholes for having children they can't afford to care for.", "NTAS\n\nYour education has the potential to pull your family out of poverty.\n\nSet an example to your siblings (especially Ollie who would hopefully follow you in to higher education) and your Parents, by going and making a success of yourself.\n\nmake it up with your parents before you go. Make them proud", "I am so sorry for you.\nYou shouldn\u2019t have all this weight on your shoulders.\n\nFrom what I see. Either you keep enabling this situation and you all keep struggling for the rest of your lives or you save yourself and in a few years, you will be able to really help your siblings if you want.\n\nPoverty is a vicious circle. It takes a lot of strenght and courage to get out of it.\n\nNow, you could maybe contact social services and see if they can help in your particular situation.\nMaybe with food stamps at least ?\n\nI wish you luck and success\n\nNTA", "(big sigh) another set of parents parentifying their eldest and expecting them to deal with the consequences of their bad choices.

You did not magically go from twelve to eighteen, this is no surprise, either.\n\nInstead of them ignoring the ticking clock, they should have asked you what your plans were for when you turned eighteen, not pretend you were going to live there for the rest of your life and never do anything for yourself. They should have been the ones to arrange a talk with you, not the other way around.\n\nThese are their children, not yours. How are you supporting the entire family when your parents don't work? If you can do that, AND go to high school, they will do even better, if ONE of them works full time, I'm sure. They can get any kind of entry level work, drive thru, delivery services, store clerk/cashier. If they both start applying, it should not be hard. \n\nTell your brother if he wants to start a secret/safe bank account, you will cosign it for him, so he can start saving for uni, NOW. Your parents will likely tell him the same thing, but will probably drain it as soon as it starts hitting a good amount. Or taking 'bits' saying it will be paid back. They will convince him you want to use it to party. Talk to him before they do. You can decide between the two of you, if he wants to give them anything, to work out the amounts to give vs. save, if he even gives them anything. \n\nI wish you luck as you start your new life.", "NTA you need to take care of yourself. If your parents are too depressed to care for your siblings & themselves call CPS.", "NTA on either count. I really hope your parents can pull themselves out of their grief to support your younger siblings like they should be doing. They decided to have 6 children, presumably knowing that they couldn\u2019t really support all of you, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to expect you to sacrifice your life, dreams and future for a decision they made. I just hope they can secure some decent jobs and not force Ollie to step into such an adult role to worry about taking care and providing for a family so young. Also, kudos to you for stepping up for as long as you did.", "Before you seek affirmation from others, weigh your guilt. Is it momentary or is it going to be something you'll have to live with. Ask yourself if not now then when and how if ever.  \n\n\nWhat is stopping you and ollie from working with the same deal, splitting the work load and saving for uni? Though at your age, I can see myself being afraid and taking off. Just know that at 25, its not too late to start out professionally.  \n\n\nPersonally I would have no qualms ditching Ollie being that he is older. However due to the under 10s specifically Eli...I'll hold the fort. That being said, Ill need my own fort eventually so I'll be making plans, delegating a lot and I'll be damn sure to make my parents and Ollie pull their weight if they aren't. Possibly opting for a more flexible institution or carrier path in terms of location or duration etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPs. Your parents are bull shitters and I would be sure to remind them that \"Eli needs you to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" each time I delegate a task to them.", "NTA\n\nIf you gave up going to university for the year to support them, you would be enabling them to continue avoiding their responsibilities as parents. It's time they woke up, got jobs and started parenting the kids they keep birthing. In other words, they need some tough love.\n\nAnd once you give up one year, they'll demand you give up another year, and another, and so on. \n\nGo to university, and let them figure out how to support themselves.\n\nYou might also anonymously send them a pamphlet or two from Planned Parenthood.", "I will not be addressing anything post the brother dying since its obvious they are the assholes. \n\nThe fact that your oarents jeot having kids while not having financial means shows they were always terrible parents.

Im sorry to insult your parents but they sound like irresponsible spongers. They kept having children they couldn\u2019t afford to look after or even feed properly, then they let their children pick up all their slack. And if the youngest is just 2, then they would have carried on having kids while you and your brother were paying the bills. Currently they are both unemployed and are not using that time to look after their children. I understand depression, but it feels convenient. Both of them clinically depressed? Neither of them making efforts to get antidepressants? All of you lost Mike, yet they are the only ones not pulling their weight.", "Thank you so much! It's just that them getting their shit together is not a guarantee which is why I feel hesitant.", "Thanks. I do feel the need to clarify that Ollie is 100% supportive of me going to uni now as he thinks that if I don't go now I'll never actually take the chance again. He just feels like I could have handled the situation better.", "That's actually a really good idea. Thank you so much for the advice, I'll see how obtainable it is.", "It\u2019s so sick that op has to be the responsible one and sit down her own parents to discuss their financial situation.", "This is actually really helpful advice, thank you. I do feel the need to clarify that Ollie is supportive of me going but just thinks I could have maybe stopped at the name-calling. I'm going to talk with him about a safety net for him and the others before I go. Thenbank account has now been added to the list! So again, thanks", "Are there social services in your area?
