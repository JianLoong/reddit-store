In general not at all.  \n\nYou may not have been nude and it could have been a mistaken interaction on his part at first, but he went beyond the limit by trying to gaslight you and reverse blame to you. \n\n\nIn regards to the female friend.

I\u2019d give her a break because she\u2019s just stuck in the middle of (from her POV) a he said she said situation.", "If he was just taking photos of your holiday that you just happened to be in then it does seem like a massive over reaction.

Either way, he repeatedly violated your privacy after you explicitly told him to stop posting personal photos. Him wanting you to pay for the Airbnb is ridiculous.", "NTA - the fact that he turned this on you and began blaming his childhood trauma for his actions is very telling. Stay away. There was a girl killed down in Mexico by her friends. Be careful who you surround yourself with. Not everyone is your friend, even if you know them for ages.", "NTA. I have met so many toxic gay dudes who will immediately play the victim card if you so much as hint they're being a jerk.", "How would you possibly be the asshole here ?", "NTA. you politely asked him to not take pictures of you & he continued to do so - and further posted them online. it\u2019d be different if you were in the background of a stranger\u2019s innocent photo on vacation, but you had already asked your friend not to take photos", "NTA", "NTA - even if the post was a genuine oversight on his part, he is being petty by now demanding you pay him for an airbnb that was FREE and he purposely taunting you by calling all of his friends and family to \"vent\" about the situation while you're in earshot. it's so bizarre to me how his female friends/family don't see anything wrong with his behaviour?? and that they would vouch for you to pay him back to boot. you already asked  him to stop taking photos of you so even if he didn't know people could zoom in on the photo (lets be real, we ALLL know you can zoom) he still knew you were in the photo and continued to post it without your consent AFTER you already told him how you were uncomfortable. he's the only AH here. good for you for leaving and for not paying anything to him", "Honestly I think people are focusing on the wrong thing here. It doesn't matter what OP was wearing. The dude was sending pictures of her to his husband and SIL without her consent and when she asked him to stop he posted a picture in his Instagram that \"coincidentally\" had her in there with a revealing swimsuit. If it had been just the insta incident I might say NAH but it feels petty to me (plus his reaction is a bit odd?) So NTA", "NTA crying equals manipulation attempt. One can't get their way through force so they need to appeal to your emotions.", "NTA. There is an unspoken rule between friends (regardless of sexuality) that you show the picture and get approval **BEFORE** posting them to everyone that is in the picture. (except for background people, that would take way to much time around new years. lol)\n\nYour friend has violated that rule and because it's a half naked picture, he violated the friendship. \n\nYour actions of cutting the vacation short and blocking him and ending the friendship was the correct move.", "NTA and he is a predator!! Then he victimized himself to get your sympathy. Red flags all around. You don\u2019t need a friend like that. Block and run!", "Just because he's gay, doesn't mean he isn't a jerk. And from my queer perspective, sexuality has nothing to do with posting pictures of other people without their consent. /Any/ pictures.\n\nThe female friend advocating for him also sounds iffy, since both, that man, and your \"friend\" are defending their violation of your privacy.\n\nI don't know if I would call your female friend's behaviour a red flag, but I would certainly not have much to do with her unless she apologised and gave me a damn good explanation.\n\nNTA", "DNTA he is toxic, it's not ur fault. I hope u have friends who can support you and take ur side.", "No it\u2019s against the law to post pics without your permission", "Can I see the photo please?", "NTA, but you should not be putting naked, semi-naked, or half-naked in this post. They all mean different things than what actually happened here.\n\nYou were in a swimsuit in public, would you also say you were purposely naked/half-naked/semi-naked in areas where children could see you? No? Then don't use that language in your post. You are using clearly provocative language in an attempt to influence our votes, and you didn't need to do that.\n\nWhile I personally think it's absurd of you to be upset at someone posting pics of you in clothing that you are comfortable wearing in public, I will also acknowledge consent is king and he ultimately did not have your consent and you communicated that. That's all that matters here.", "NTA, people are getting stuck on you being naked or not but the fact that he posted your pics even after you asked him not to is already enough for him to be an AH. He's being dramatic by asking you to pay for the Airbnb.", "NTA. Bad behaviour is bad behaviour, and he just kept escalating.", "LOL such an asshole!!", "NTA but your friend deserves a chance to explain herself. Maybe he was feeding her untruths about the situation. The guy sounds unhinged.", "sounds like you guys were at the beach and he took photos of you in a bathing suit?   \n\n\nif you wanted them deleted he should have deleted them but i understand why he didnt think it was a big deal to post pictures of a vacation you guys went on together.", "Another fantasy post on AITA. Good grief", "Yeah the wording is throwing me off too", "But she clearly asked him to not to share with others so...", "My friends and I (regardless of sexual identity), always ask for consent before posting photos, even group photos. My male friends are especially very aware about not posting women on their socials if: the women are wearing particularly revealing clothing or if it's a solo photo. With all the creeps and disgusting online predators, I didn't know people still posted without consent.", "She specifcally withdrew her consent. Wether she was wearing nothing, a bathing suit or 12 wintercoats is irrelevant after that.", "It was a revealing swimsuit so I was semi naked. And yep, you're right, this has made me think about who I allow to photograph me in the first place. I have swimsuit photos of him but wouldn't share them with anyone except him (because why would I). But now I understand not everyone has that mentality. If it's on their phone, they own the photo (even if I politely ask them to keep it private)", "Nope I was the only person in the photograph that he posted. He claimed he thought it'd be okay for him to post a half naked photo of me because I was so far off into the distance. I showed him that I could zoom into Instagram posts so anyone viewing the picture could tell it's me. He claimed he didn't know people could zoom into Instagram posts", "Thank you for sharing! \n\nTbh I didn't want to report him for 'just a photo' but then he started involving our mutual friends so now I might need to!", "OP really needs to make up her mind...", "It was a swimsuit/ half naked. Photos were taken by the Airbnb pool (private-ish) and beach (public)\nSome I knew were being taken, others I didn't", "I hear you. Tbh what he did is done and I am sure I don't want him in my life (even as I hope things turn out okay for him)\n\nI just am saddened by the friends behavior. I don't want to lose her. And your perspective helps. She's just stuck in the middle! I've known her longer and she isn't close to him (definitely not as close as I am to either of them). I don't know what he told her exactly and I also don't intend on asking, because it'll add fuel to the fire", "That's fair. \nSome photos were 100% of me while others I just happened to be in.\nI did ask him to not post photos of me, and he did this despite that. And then he started to blame me. I think we could have talked it out ultimately but he was on call with everyone we knew for 10-12 hours after the incident, retelling the story of the incident in great detail, crying then laughing then crying. All the while sending me page long texts. So at some point I realized he had stuff going on in life that really wasn't about me. And I didn't have the skill to help him, and I wasn't safe around him (hurt people hurt people), so I packed up and left", "In my country of origin, its rare for people of the opposite gender to be friends, let alone travel the world together/share an Airbnb. Part of this is culture but women's safety around men is also a big concern. For me, it was easier to justify travel with a married homosexual man than it would be a straight single man. It's a safety bias I'd carried over into my international life", "Not to mention that even if he was abused by family that doesn\u2019t give him the right to act that way", "Cheers\n\nIt's hard to understand privacy/consent dynamics in this age of social media. \n\nI appreciate you sharing your perspective!\n\nAnd yep, I have no intention of paying him for a service he isn't paying for either. Just sad that he is bringing mutual friends down into the drama!", "Yep, learning that the hard way: hurt people hurt people.\n\nThere is no safety in knowing someone for a longer period of time! Humans change, we ignore red flags, definitions of friendship change etc etc. \n\nMexico is a scary place as it is, hopefully my next experience is a better one!!!", "This breaks my heart tbh. I protected this person and their secrets,and provided counseling services for so many years as they struggled. And then THIS \n\nOverall: the experience is teaching me that it's important to judge people based on their behavior more than the lazy labels our brains get used to. As a blanket statement, I'd assumed gay men would be safer than straight men because no sexual incentive.  BUT more and more I see how not true that is", "Idk for not letting him get away with it? I know some women who'd have forgiven him on the spot or not even created a fuss. Or others who would have given into his breakdown and forgiven him\n\nSelf doubt crept in when a somewhat-feminist-female-friend started to engage with him and try to advocate on his behalf", "Yep, I don't miss him in my life and after this incident, I realized I ignored red flags from our previous interactions. Just sad that he is bringing in other friends into the drama - and some of them are engaging in it!", "Thanks for sharing your perspective!\n\nI think I've always assumed that difficult experiences make humans kinder, give us more empathy. And I know most queer folk where I come from have had struggles. Now I understand some people respond to difficult experiences by becoming difficult people. And that's perhaps not my burden to carry!\n\nRe the friend: still torn about it tbh. I think I'm just waiting to see if she brings it up again, so I can demand that explanation. I personally have zero tolerance for men violating consent but understand not all women may feel the same way!", "It's not against the law. If a person is out in public you have no reason or right to privacy when it comes to someone recording you or taking your picture.", "No it isn\u2019t. They were in a public space. It might not even be against the social media\u2019s TOS.", "Oooh I didn't know that! Thanks for sharing this!!!", "wtf is wrong with you", "it seems like OP is pretty conservative/religious and considers a \u201crevealing bikini\u201d to be half naked", "yes. i was just asking because the wording confused me a little bit , plus OP replied to my comment and wasn\u2019t upset by it", "posting without asking is definitely an asshole move. i just mean that it it implied sometimes , that doesn\u2019t make it okay but it also doesn\u2019t make OP\u2019s friend creepy", "correct. i was just curious because of the wording", "calling 'delete this photo of us i don't like the hat i was wearing' a 'consent' violation makes it sound like he is sexually assaulting her.", "It could indeed be a matter of different perspective/mentality but his reaction after the incident clearly showed that it is not a small misunderstanding but he knew what he was doing.", "i will also say if you sent him photos of you but not him it might imply you wanted them posted? i have friends who use socials and i don\u2019t. i just make a throwaway reddit every few months to give my two cents . so to them, i send photos because i still want to be included. if that makes sense? i would just tell him you don\u2019t want anything posted without permission", "So you were wearing a swimsuit in public where anyone could have photographed you?", "So he took a picture of you in a revealing bathing suit in a public area? You realize anyone could have taken a photo of you in that situation don\u2019t you? He was wrong to post the photo without asking. I just don\u2019t think there should have been an expectation of privacy if that was the situation.", "So like, he was taking a picture of the view and it happens that you were in the background of the picture? Because if people had to zoom to realise that was you, doesn't that mean you were enough far away?\n\nIf that's the case, where you're not the \"main theme\" of the photo and you're just in the background, I don't think what he did was wrong, since you were far enough for people don't see you unless they zoom. And like someone else said in the comments, that is like a stranger took a photo and you showed up in the distance, the difference is that you know the person who took the photo.\n\nI don't think you're TA either, obviously you didn't liked that and you were setting a boundary with your friend and either the way you approached him was not the best or he got too defensive about it, maybe the problem was in that part of the communication.", "You probably know what's far better for you than anyone else here to do. Hope you figure something out!", "Swimsuit and half naked, while technically the same, are very different connotations. Stop being dramatic", "Naked means having your private area or boobs on display. A swimsuit usually covers these parts so ????? \nHe\u2019s still an AH especially for the dramatics and it\u2019s not cool he posted pics of you in a swimsuit but your post is kind of weird", "Yeah I would let it go as long as she does going forward.  I would bet he said some stuff to try and gain sympathy from her and put you in a bad light which put her in an awkward situation.", "I do think how he behaved afterward was inappropriate. He seems very over sensitive and dramatic. It would be a shame to lose a friendship over something that started out as trivial but has turned in to a massive issue but sometimes thinks aren\u2019t repairable.", "Oh, I assumed you were two guy friends! \n\n Def nta!", "DARVO is an acronym everyone needs to have googled at least once.", ">and provided counseling services for so many years\n\nAs much as it breaks my heart to tell you that, but I think you just got used because of that.", "Yeah, that's the problem isn't it. One would think victims would become advocates against abuse, instead of turning into abusers themselves - but sometimes they think the only way they can reclaim their \"power\", is by doing this.\n\nI say this as a queer desi ladki (just noticed your handle - hi fellow desi!) who returned from pardesh only to be reminded that asshats are asshats regardless of country, race, and/or gender. I'm sorry your trust was betrayed and you ended up dealing with it alone.\n\nAll the best, friend. I hope your year ahead is gentle and that the people you meet this year prove to be kind and honourable.", "Op said the naked pictures of him were taken without his consent, then posted without his consent. In most countries that\u2019s an invasion of privacy and against the law. Being naked in a public space is a law broken on its own for public indecency.", "It\u2019s not.", "I didn't send him photos of me. He took photos of me using his phone.\n\nMy phone had some photos of him that he'd asked me to capture but I hadn't transferred those across to him.\n\nAnd tbf I did ask him politely to not share anything before he did.\n\nBut I hear you: some people might take presence on social media as consent", "Just because anyone can, doesn't mean they should.\nIf OP came across some photos on social media of her taken by a random person, she'd probably feel just as violated.", "Hahaa you're right. Just the day before he posted that photo of me, he gave the beachside restaraunt owners shit because other dudes were filming women in bathing suits.\nI guess it's the hypocrisy that got me too. Lesson learned: don't wear swimsuits in public if I don't want to be photographed. Better to wait until I'm rich enough to afford a private beach villa, if ever one day!!!", "Appreciate it!!!\nGuess it helps to have wisdom from folks for moments of self doubt.\nI haven't shared this story with a lot of people, because I don't want to be blamed for dressing a certain way or agreeing to travel with a man in the first place. \nAgain,thanks for sharing your perspective!", "Yeah I bet he did!\nAnd I find it's very easy for men to cast doubt on women's behaviors. I know this friend isn't the most confident in her own opinions so would be easy to influence, and I think I'm not willing to play the game of influence because I think she deserves to be treated better.\nAnyhoo, hopefully it goes away and the friend and I get to repair the damage!", "Thanks I should have clarified the gender in the post", "I just Googled it, didn't know it existed! This is brilliant!", "Hahaa naah I figured, you're all good!\n\nI realized that's why this person kept coming back to me..they wanted to feel better without having to go to therapy. Over the years I've learned I have this 'skill' that I'm now more careful with. Trying to be better about who I'm kind to /allow into my personal space", "You could walk around naked it still doesn\u2019t give him the right to 1) take photos of you and 2) post and share them. Both things are a huge invasion of privacy and breach of trust. NTA and you did the right thing by going non contact. His behaviour was predatory", "oh oops i\u2019m sorry the 4th paragraph confused me , i thought you sent him photos of yourself but not photos you took of him lol which would be strange. i think you are in the right and given time this will calm down", "Good luck.  I hope it works out.", "Updated!! Thanks for picking this up. Definitely no intention of being homophobic.", "Definitely, because from a male pov it kind of comes across as homophobic  vs female in danger and a man being gross and ignoring her\n\nEfit: sorry if this comes across bad, its 6am and im horrible at putting my thoughts down so i hope this makes sense and isnt rude or anything", "You're not supposed to use it as an inspiration!\n\n/s just kidding I know that's not what you meant.", "It does fit quite well. From his reaction according to your post, he sounds pretty narcissistic. I believe DARVO is often used by narcissists to avoid accountability.", ">You could walk around naked it still doesn\u2019t give him the right to 1) take photos of you and 2) post and share them. \n\nso if you take photos of some random naked guy walking down the street you are violating HIS consent?", "All good! I do hope it calms down", "Cheers:)", "Lololll on point!\nAnd if it helps, I lack the skills to play that game \ud83e\udd23\nHelps to have the framework so I can spot it the next time it happens to me or around me"]}
