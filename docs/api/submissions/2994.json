It makes more sense for it to be a roast lol.", "okay let\u2019s talk about iliza\u2019s frequent use of the n word as an adult who surely knew that was not appropriate for her to say.", "Bronco guy. \n\nPS5 guy \n\nArt room guy\n\nThe girl whose mom in law went to her honey moon with her and she decided to switch resort.
