For those of you who might not be familiar with her work, Iliza is a stand-up comedian and late-night talk show host and we are beyond thrilled to have her join us for a talk.\n\nFor those of you who are new to these talks, the \"AITA Revisited\" format is one where we, with the permission of OPs, revisit some of the most interesting (and contentious) already-shared posts this sub has to offer!\n\n# [What is Reddit Talk?](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404349195284-What-is-Reddit-Talk-#:%7E:text=Reddit%20Talk%20is%20a%20new,that%20any%20redditor%20can%20join.)\n\n# How it works\n\nLog in to the official Reddit app and join the [/r/AmItheAsshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole)  subreddit. You should get a notification when the Talk goes live, but  if you aren't notified, check this sticky for a direct link.\n\nYou can also tap **FOLLOW** on this post (found on the upper right hand side on new Reddit) and get a notification when the event starts!\n\n*All posts we share are taken directly from the subreddit with the posters'  explicit permission.

I don't know who on her team talked her into this, but she shouldn't be giving this sub and it's nonsense the time of day. I mean it's a fun little time waster but I feel bad she's lowering herself to it.", "Thank you for explaining the context. For me, AMAs just aren't interesting. It makes more sense for it to be a roast lol.", "okay let\u2019s talk about iliza\u2019s frequent use of the n word as an adult who surely knew that was not appropriate for her to say.", "Bronco guy. \n\nPS5 guy \n\nArt room guy\n\nThe girl whose mom in law went to her honey moon with her and she decided to switch resort. I think she even posted pictures?", "weirder than any of the other celebs?", "Why?", "[Obligatory CumTown Bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I49ec95gV_g)", "I personally find her comedy really funny but I can see how others might not. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/qmT9OuWkwxo", "How? Comedians do roast commentary when they read up on crazy stories. Bill Burr for example does this in his podcast with people who write in every week. \n\nLliza is doing the same, but on Reddit!

Her style of comedy is just loud observations like that dumb kid from the Totino\u2019s Pizza Roll commercial. \n\nLike, no shit you love pizza rolls. We all love them. It\u2019s why we\u2019re making them in the dark. Because we\u2019re all unsupervised  children trying to use an oven after midnight. Stop stating the obvious.", "She TA.", "Meh", "Yay! AIA on AITA"]}
