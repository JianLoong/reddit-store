For those of you who might not be familiar with her work, Iliza is a stand-up comedian and late-night talk show host and we are beyond thrilled to have her join us for a talk.\n\nFor those of you who are new to these talks, the \"AITA Revisited\" format is one where we, with the permission of OPs, revisit some of the most interesting (and contentious) already-shared posts this sub has to offer!\n\n# [What is Reddit Talk?](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404349195284-What-is-Reddit-Talk-#:%7E:text=Reddit%20Talk%20is%20a%20new,that%20any%20redditor%20can%20join.)\n\n# How it works\n\nLog in to the official Reddit app and join the [/r/AmItheAsshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole)  subreddit. You should get a notification when the Talk goes live, but  if you aren't notified, check this sticky for a direct link.\n\nYou can also tap **FOLLOW** on this post (found on the upper right hand side on new Reddit) and get a notification when the event starts!\n\n*All posts we share are taken directly from the subreddit with the posters'  explicit permission.

I think of a \"Specialist\". At least someone who has done some studies. \n\n\n\nI will ignore any and all \"chat time\" themed AMAs, live chats, etc. I don't have time to place so much importance on what one stranger is saying, especially when everyone else talking is also a stranger. I'll read comments, but I won't go out of my way to hear one specific person's opinion. Bonus points if I have never even heard their name previously. That also feels like the case 90% of the time.\n\n\nEdit: God forbid someone doesn't jump to excitement for an AMA. I'm sure she's a good person, but I'm allowed to say I'm not down for AMAs lmao. Even if it was John Lennon, I still wouldn't know the guy personally, and wouldn't be interested in an AMA.\n\n\n\nThank you to the person who explained that it will be more of a roast. Context helps.", "I figured this was going to be more of a roast by Iliza rather than introspection. She has the credentials for one and not the other.", "She\u2019s promoting a tour.", "Right? I don't know who on her team talked her into this, but she shouldn't be giving this sub and it's nonsense the time of day. I mean it's a fun little time waster but I feel bad she's lowering herself to it.", "Thank you for explaining the context. For me, AMAs just aren't interesting. It makes more sense for it to be a roast lol."]}
