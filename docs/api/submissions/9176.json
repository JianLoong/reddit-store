{"id": 9176, "submission_id": "10tyql0", "title": "AITA for punishing both my kids?", "selftext": "I 38M have 2 boys. Mark 12M and Steven 16M. Steven recently came home past his curfew, but it's not a reoccurring issue. He's got good grades, helps out around the house, and is generally respectful. He's a big help and because of that we are a little lenient with him. Sometimes you're having a good time and time slips by, no biggy. Mark is also a great kid, but he's been doing things that are just kind of conniving? \n\n First was Mark going into Steven's room. Mark told me with kind of a smirk that he found Steven had a pile up of dishes in his room, which isn't allowed. Once you're done with your food, I expect you to bring your dishes down at the end of the day. I talked to Steven about it, and he apologized. His punishment? Washing his dishes by hand. We have a dishwasher, but I felt it fitting to make him do it by hand. However, what concerned me was Mark shouldn't have been in Steven room in the first place. I get it, though. My older brothers room always seemed so cool when I grew up. But I told Mark to stay out of Steven's room unless he has Steven's permission. \n\nAnother time, Mark came to us about Steven playing an inappropriate game. GTA V. My wife and I bought him the game. Mark didn't know about it cause we didn't want him playing it and being exposed to that content (yet). Mark was in Steven's room watching him play the game. He stayed to watch him play and told us later that night. Yet again, it seemed like Mark was getting a kick out of telling us. I sat Steven down and explained to him that while we are allowing him to have this game and are comfortable with him viewing mature material, I don't want him exposing Mark to it. \n\nLastly was Steven coming home late from his friend's. Me and my wife knew he was late because when he gets home, he usually knocks on our door and lets us know. Plus, I heard him (clumsily) try to sneak in without us noticing. My wife was asleep at the time, so I just pretended not to hear and let it slide. However, the next morning, Mark brings it up with a grin. I asked Steven about it, and he admitted and apologized. I told him that if he was going to be late, he could have at least contacted us. I told him he couldn't go out for the rest of the weekend (I knew he was using the weekend to study anyway). \n\nThe thing is, I want my kids to stick together. I also didn't appreciate Mark telling on his brother to humor himself. So I told Mark that since he enjoys telling on his brother so much, he's punished too (same punishment). Especially since steven admitted to coming home at a time  past marks bedtime. After the kids had dispersed, my wife told me she didn't approve. I explained that Mark is clearly getting a kick out of getting Steven in trouble, but my wife explained that if Steven was following the rules, he wouldn't get in trouble in the first place. She thinks I'm being unfair to Mark. I doubled down, and now my wife is obviously bothered by my decision and making it very clear.

Tell him you dont appreciate your kids trying to get each other in trouble deliberately. Show him your priority is not having a favorite and a problem child but allowing them to grow and learn from their own experiences (within reason) while providing support and love.", "Steven broke curfew so you chose a consequence. Mark needs to learn that it is not his job to monitor his brother, that\u2019s your job. \n\nNTA\n\nedit: words", "NTA. No one likes a nonstop tattle tale, and it doesn't sound like the 16 year old is doing anything that could really be an issue down the line.", "NTA.

You want to foster an environment where mark knows that trying to get his brother in trouble isn\u2019t cool, but also isn\u2019t afraid to come to you in the case of Steven doing something seriously wrong.  \nI don\u2019t have a full solution for you, but I think it starts with talking to your wife about your expectations of the kids, getting on the same page, and then the two of you have a discussion with the children about boundaries and being respectful to each other.  \nGood luck, OP \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA\n\nYour wife sounds like she is the problem here. Kids tend to do this when they know they won't get into trouble or this has been encouraged by another adult in their life. Mark is looking for things to needle his brother about and its only going to get worse. Seems like Steven might not have snuck up the stairs if he didn't feel like he has a tiny, mean spy in his little brother.", "NTA. Stevens punishments are fair for what he is doing. I think it\u2019s better to talk to Mark about \u201cstaying in his lane\u201d a bit more often. There are obviously things that if Mark is noticing you want him to feel comfortable telling you about Steven. Ex. bullying, self harm, drinking or drugs. But running to you about games and plates is not his concern.", "NTA. It\u2019s completely reasonable to cut a generally good kid some slack. Not every lapse has to be punished. Sometimes it\u2019s enough to remind a kid what the rules are and that you need them to follow the rules.\n\neta (hit reply too soon): Mark\u2019s behavior has to stop, though. I would either (1) punish Mark every time he tattles with an appropriate consequence for that misbehavior (not whatever is happening to Steven, that\u2019s just silly for a lot of reasons) or (2) make it very clear to Mark that Steven will definitely not be getting in trouble for any behavior you find out about from Mark. Take all the fun out of it.\n\n I don\u2019t know what your wife\u2019s deal is.", "Mark is manipulating you and his brother for his entertainment. One time, you should allow Steven to stay out late.

You should talk to mark about situations where it\u2019s ok to tell on his brother vs. being a tattle tale.", "NTA, I was prepared to point out that collective punishment is against the geneva convention, but you handled it well, and it sounds like they both got a reasonable consequence for the respective misdeeds.", "YTA. It\u2019s clear you favor your elder son. Probably this is why the younger one feels the need to point out that his brother is being \u201cbad\u201d as well.", "YTA. It sounds like you don\u2019t have good communication with your younger child and he is trying to find ways to let you know that he feels you treat him harsher than his brother. You said a couple times that you let things slide with the older one. Do you treat the older one like a golden child who can do no wrong and the younger one like a scapegoat who can do nothing right? It would be a good idea to see a family counselor so your son can openly communicate with you without fear of punishment", "YTA\n\nIt's interesting - you brushed off all the older boy's violations like they were just kids being kids, but are punishing the youngest when he didn't do anything except tattle, which is a different issue entirely (and a 12 year old to boot). Thing is, without Mark telling you, you never would have known these things, which leads me to believe you are giving a teenager too much leeway. There is such a thing as trust and verify. Right now, Steven is abusing your good will. And you are not verifying Steven's behavior. You seem to think that the tattling is a more serious offense than the Steven's violations combined - it seems to bother you more.  It's a well worn tradition for brothers to get each other in trouble - this is not that unusual.", "YTA, It's super weird that you heard your elder child sneaking in and knew he was breaking rules long before your younger child came to tell you. But you still decided to punish the younger child for telling you something you already knew. It's like you are going out of your way to find justification to punish him.\n\nYou know if you keep this weird favouritism up he's never going to want to tell you anything.", "I'm very divided here. YTA for this scenario. Pushing him for telling is an AH move when his brother is directly breaking a rule that I'm guessing is for his safety. I'm sure if he'd been doing drugs or something you'd want Mark to tell? So don't punish him for that. But him going into his room without permission is absolutely when you should have stopped him. You also need to get your older child a lock on his door if the younger one is constantly entering the room. Keep a key that you and your wife can access and have the rule be it can't be locked when he's home. \n\nYou and your wife need to sit down and discuss how to actually deal with Mark, you can't just ignore her wishes and do all the parenting yourself.  It's very unhealthy. But you can't let Mark continue to be a brat either. If Steven is otherwise very well behaved though you letting him get away with some little things does make sense, but your wife has to agree.", "YTA\nI think talking to Mark about not needing to dob on his brother about everything is fine but agree with your wife that punishing him is too far.\nEssentially you are punishing your younger son for talking to you. That's never something you want to do. \nYou say you're doing this because you want your kids to \"stick together\" which is great and why I think talking to Mark about this would be fine but punishing him for telling you what's going on isn't going to achieve that goal. If anything it will build resentment. \nIt's perfectly normal for kids that age to dob on each other and try to get each other in trouble. I think your best bet is a discussion with Mark about when he SHOULD tell you about what's going on and when it's not necessary. Then if it happens again just give a disinterested \"huh\" type answer. Oh and make sure any consequences for Stephen are discussed away from Mark so that Mark doesn't get to see any sort of \"victory\"\nLastly I think possibly the biggest reason you're TA is for not listening to your wife and dismissing her concerns.\nDon't stress too much though. My brother and I did this stuff to each other all the time. Now we are best friends, live round the corner from each other and are raising our kids nearly as siblings.", "YTA it's obvious you have a favorite child. Steven is getting himself in trouble you just aren't paying enough attention to see it. You also need to be a team in punishments not just lay it down and go oh well. YTA all the way around", "Gentle YTA, since the punishment for Mark came out of nowhere. I think would have made sense to talk to Mark first before going straight to punishment. That being said, you're right to be concerned about this behavior. \n\nMy sister and I have roughly the same age gap as your sons, and at that age, we hated each other and were constantly fighting. Despite that, we had an unspoken truce not to tell on each other for things that didn't concern us. I really do believe that unspoken truce played a role in the reasonably good bond we have as adults; we felt comfortable telling each other things that we didn't want our parents to know, and were able to build a solid level of trust. \n\nMark's attitude towards his brother could affect their relationship moving forward, and he's maybe a bit young to realize the consequences of his actions. Also, if he's like this with other people, it will affect other relationships of his as well. You really should talk to him about his motivations for telling on his brother, and to think about when he would be better off letting things go.", "Sorry, YTA. You punished Mark for a rule you did not previously announce or make, making your decisions arbitrary. If you want your children to \"stick together\", you have to actually put some work into encouraging it, rather than punishing them at random.\n\nThe time to punish Mark was when he went into Steven's room without his permission.", "Against the grain here but YTA Mark is possibly being typical younger brother, but it seems like you might also have some favoritism issues going on here that he is trying to address in an immature way.", "YTA\n\nMark went into Steven's room multiple times and then tattled on him.  Honestly, those feel like major missed opportunities to teach Mark about respecting other's privacy.  You really need to impose on him the importance of respecting privacy.\n\nI also feel like you are going easy on Steven violating curfew and punishing Marc for Steven violating a rule that you already knew he violated!  Then you acted like it was some kind of big surprise the next morning? WTF?  Either the rule is there or its not there.  You should have addressed immediately instead of being lazy and hoping it got swept under the rug.", "Soft YTA. Marks behavior is concerning, but it warrants a conversation, not a punishment. I think it would have been fair to punish Mark for going in his brothers room, but in this case it doesn\u2019t seem like Mark did anything clearly against the rules, so not sure why you chose this particular instance to punish him.", "YTA. You very obviously favor Steven, and Mark is trying to show you that your little angel isn't so perfect. You need to parent Mark and be there for him instead of punishing him for things his brother does. Steven doesn't follow the rules because he doesn't have consequences. This is a shit show.", "YTA", "YTA. I understand you don\u2019t want him tattling, but it\u2019s actually none of your business - that is a conflict between Mark and Steven.\n\nThey are old enough to resolve this themselves. Not only that, they will grow by developing the skills to resolve their own conflicts instead of with your intervention. That\u2019s actually maturing, instead of learning to follow rules.\n\nLet Steven know when Mark tattles and leave it at that. Let Mark know you will be doing this as well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I am betting he didn't want him in there but didn't feel like his parents would make Mark leave, so he ignored him.

How would Mark even know?\n\n>specially since steven admitted to coming home at a time past marks bedtime. \n\nYou'd ignored it, your wife was asleep, and I guarantee after Mark had got him in trouble *twice*, tattling, Steven didn't tell Mark about it. Yet Mark knew about it to tattle in the morning.\n\nMark is deliberately snooping and invading Steven's space. Whether he's looking for ways to get him in trouble or not is unclear, but it's not a one time thing.\n\nAnd the tattling isn't either.\n\nAlso, I didn't give a judgment because I believe most of the consequences here were fair, and the kids' behaviors were normal... and I don't even feel strongly on grounding Mark, one way or another.\n\nBut... I don't feel like it fits the pattern of punishment-fits-the-crime the rest had, either. \n\nI might suggest Mark not be allowed in Steven's room, at all, for at least the weekend... and if it's not already a rule, he shouldn't ever be allowed in there without Steven inviting him in. Otherwise it might be fostering resentment? Idk... tough one.\n\nMaybe Mark is encroaching on Steven's space and tattling because he misses him? But lack of privacy isn't going to make Steven appreciate his company or give him positive attention, either.\n\nMaybe a designated \"bro time\" or something? \n\nDefinitely at the least, Mark needs a chat about respecting boundaries and privacy, and about the difference between \"telling\" when something is dangerous and \"tattling\" to get someone in trouble... If it helps, I just asked what's the difference of my 13, and my kid wasn't real sure on the difference either, since it's never been a problem till now... still in the range of normal behavior, I think.\n\nI wouldn't worry with the grounding one way or the other, it sounds like the kids are doing well overall... but it is important to reach a consensus with your wife, united front and all that. \n\nThink I'm rambling now, so ... good luck!", "It sounds like you have generally good kids and your younger son is being a little bit of a shit to his brother for whatever reason.

The end of this weekend might also be a good opportunity to sit down with both of them together (along with your wife) and reflect on why they were both punished. If Mark wants Steven to get in trouble for relatively minor infractions that aren't dangerous (such as having dishes in his room), surely he understands why he was punished for a relatively minor infraction (staying up past his bedtime).
