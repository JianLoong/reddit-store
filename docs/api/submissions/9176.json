{"id": 9176, "submission_id": "10tyql0", "title": "AITA for punishing both my kids?", "selftext": "I 38M have 2 boys. Mark 12M and Steven 16M. Steven recently came home past his curfew, but it's not a reoccurring issue. He's got good grades, helps out around the house, and is generally respectful. He's a big help and because of that we are a little lenient with him. Sometimes you're having a good time and time slips by, no biggy. Mark is also a great kid, but he's been doing things that are just kind of conniving? \n\n First was Mark going into Steven's room. Mark told me with kind of a smirk that he found Steven had a pile up of dishes in his room, which isn't allowed. Once you're done with your food, I expect you to bring your dishes down at the end of the day. I talked to Steven about it, and he apologized. His punishment? Washing his dishes by hand. We have a dishwasher, but I felt it fitting to make him do it by hand. However, what concerned me was Mark shouldn't have been in Steven room in the first place. I get it, though. My older brothers room always seemed so cool when I grew up. But I told Mark to stay out of Steven's room unless he has Steven's permission. \n\nAnother time, Mark came to us about Steven playing an inappropriate game. GTA V. My wife and I bought him the game. Mark didn't know about it cause we didn't want him playing it and being exposed to that content (yet). Mark was in Steven's room watching him play the game. He stayed to watch him play and told us later that night. Yet again, it seemed like Mark was getting a kick out of telling us. I sat Steven down and explained to him that while we are allowing him to have this game and are comfortable with him viewing mature material, I don't want him exposing Mark to it. \n\nLastly was Steven coming home late from his friend's. Me and my wife knew he was late because when he gets home, he usually knocks on our door and lets us know. Plus, I heard him (clumsily) try to sneak in without us noticing. My wife was asleep at the time, so I just pretended not to hear and let it slide. However, the next morning, Mark brings it up with a grin. I asked Steven about it, and he admitted and apologized. I told him that if he was going to be late, he could have at least contacted us. I told him he couldn't go out for the rest of the weekend (I knew he was using the weekend to study anyway). \n\nThe thing is, I want my kids to stick together. I also didn't appreciate Mark telling on his brother to humor himself. So I told Mark that since he enjoys telling on his brother so much, he's punished too (same punishment). Especially since steven admitted to coming home at a time  past marks bedtime. After the kids had dispersed, my wife told me she didn't approve. I explained that Mark is clearly getting a kick out of getting Steven in trouble, but my wife explained that if Steven was following the rules, he wouldn't get in trouble in the first place. She thinks I'm being unfair to Mark. I doubled down, and now my wife is obviously bothered by my decision and making it very clear.

Show him your priority is not having a favorite and a problem child but allowing them to grow and learn from their own experiences (within reason) while providing support and love.", "Steven broke curfew so you chose a consequence.

No one likes a nonstop tattle tale, and it doesn't sound like the 16 year old is doing anything that could really be an issue down the line.", "NTA.

Kids tend to do this when they know they won't get into trouble or this has been encouraged by another adult in their life.

Seems like Steven might not have snuck up the stairs if he didn't feel like he has a tiny, mean spy in his little brother.", "NTA. Stevens punishments are fair for what he is doing. I think it\u2019s better to talk to Mark about \u201cstaying in his lane\u201d a bit more often. There are obviously things that if Mark is noticing you want him to feel comfortable telling you about Steven. Ex. bullying, self harm, drinking or drugs. But running to you about games and plates is not his concern.", "NTA. It\u2019s completely reasonable to cut a generally good kid some slack. Not every lapse has to be punished. Sometimes it\u2019s enough to remind a kid what the rules are and that you need them to follow the rules.\n\neta (hit reply too soon): Mark\u2019s behavior has to stop, though. I would either (1) punish Mark every time he tattles with an appropriate consequence for that misbehavior (not whatever is happening to Steven, that\u2019s just silly for a lot of reasons) or (2) make it very clear to Mark that Steven will definitely not be getting in trouble for any behavior you find out about from Mark.

It\u2019s clear you favor your elder son. Probably this is why the younger one feels the need to point out that his brother is being \u201cbad\u201d as well.", "YTA. It sounds like you don\u2019t have good communication with your younger child and he is trying to find ways to let you know that he feels you treat him harsher than his brother. You said a couple times that you let things slide with the older one. Do you treat the older one like a golden child who can do no wrong and the younger one like a scapegoat who can do nothing right? It would be a good idea to see a family counselor so your son can openly communicate with you without fear of punishment", "YTA\n\nIt's interesting - you brushed off all the older boy's violations like they were just kids being kids, but are punishing the youngest when he didn't do anything except tattle, which is a different issue entirely (and a 12 year old to boot). Thing is, without Mark telling you, you never would have known these things, which leads me to believe you are giving a teenager too much leeway. There is such a thing as trust and verify. Right now, Steven is abusing your good will. And you are not verifying Steven's behavior. You seem to think that the tattling is a more serious offense than the Steven's violations combined - it seems to bother you more.  It's a well worn tradition for brothers to get each other in trouble - this is not that unusual.", "YTA, It's super weird that you heard your elder child sneaking in and knew he was breaking rules long before your younger child came to tell you. But you still decided to punish the younger child for telling you something you already knew. It's like you are going out of your way to find justification to punish him.\n\nYou know if you keep this weird favouritism up he's never going to want to tell you anything.", "I'm very divided here. YTA for this scenario. Pushing him for telling is an AH move when his brother is directly breaking a rule that I'm guessing is for his safety. I'm sure if he'd been doing drugs or something you'd want Mark to tell? So don't punish him for that. But him going into his room without permission is absolutely when you should have stopped him. You also need to get your older child a lock on his door if the younger one is constantly entering the room. Keep a key that you and your wife can access and have the rule be it can't be locked when he's home. \n\nYou and your wife need to sit down and discuss how to actually deal with Mark, you can't just ignore her wishes and do all the parenting yourself.  It's very unhealthy. But you can't let Mark continue to be a brat either. If Steven is otherwise very well behaved though you letting him get away with some little things does make sense, but your wife has to agree.", "YTA\nI think talking to Mark about not needing to dob on his brother about everything is fine but agree with your wife that punishing him is too far.\nEssentially you are punishing your younger son for talking to you. That's never something you want to do. \nYou say you're doing this because you want your kids to \"stick together\" which is great and why I think talking to Mark about this would be fine but punishing him for telling you what's going on isn't going to achieve that goal. If anything it will build resentment. \nIt's perfectly normal for kids that age to dob on each other and try to get each other in trouble. I think your best bet is a discussion with Mark about when he SHOULD tell you about what's going on and when it's not necessary. Then if it happens again just give a disinterested \"huh\" type answer. Oh and make sure any consequences for Stephen are discussed away from Mark so that Mark doesn't get to see any sort of \"victory\"\nLastly I think possibly the biggest reason you're TA is for not listening to your wife and dismissing her concerns.\nDon't stress too much though. My brother and I did this stuff to each other all the time. Now we are best friends, live round the corner from each other and are raising our kids nearly as siblings.", "YTA it's obvious you have a favorite child. Steven is getting himself in trouble you just aren't paying enough attention to see it. You also need to be a team in punishments not just lay it down and go oh well. YTA all the way around", "Gentle YTA, since the punishment for Mark came out of nowhere. I think would have made sense to talk to Mark first before going straight to punishment. That being said, you're right to be concerned about this behavior. \n\nMy sister and I have roughly the same age gap as your sons, and at that age, we hated each other and were constantly fighting. Despite that, we had an unspoken truce not to tell on each other for things that didn't concern us. I really do believe that unspoken truce played a role in the reasonably good bond we have as adults; we felt comfortable telling each other things that we didn't want our parents to know, and were able to build a solid level of trust. \n\nMark's attitude towards his brother could affect their relationship moving forward, and he's maybe a bit young to realize the consequences of his actions. Also, if he's like this with other people, it will affect other relationships of his as well. You really should talk to him about his motivations for telling on his brother, and to think about when he would be better off letting things go.", "Sorry, YTA. You punished Mark for a rule you did not previously announce or make, making your decisions arbitrary. If you want your children to \"stick together\", you have to actually put some work into encouraging it, rather than punishing them at random.\n\nThe time to punish Mark was when he went into Steven's room without his permission.", "Against the grain here but YTA Mark is possibly being typical younger brother, but it seems like you might also have some favoritism issues going on here that he is trying to address in an immature way.", "YTA\n\nMark went into Steven's room multiple times and then tattled on him.  Honestly, those feel like major missed opportunities to teach Mark about respecting other's privacy.  You really need to impose on him the importance of respecting privacy.\n\nI also feel like you are going easy on Steven violating curfew and punishing Marc for Steven violating a rule that you already knew he violated!  Then you acted like it was some kind of big surprise the next morning? WTF?  Either the rule is there or its not there.  You should have addressed immediately instead of being lazy and hoping it got swept under the rug.", "Soft YTA. Marks behavior is concerning, but it warrants a conversation, not a punishment. I think it would have been fair to punish Mark for going in his brothers room, but in this case it doesn\u2019t seem like Mark did anything clearly against the rules, so not sure why you chose this particular instance to punish him.", "YTA. You very obviously favor Steven, and Mark is trying to show you that your little angel isn't so perfect. You need to parent Mark and be there for him instead of punishing him for things his brother does. Steven doesn't follow the rules because he doesn't have consequences. This is a shit show.", "YTA", "YTA. I understand you don\u2019t want him tattling, but it\u2019s actually none of your business - that is a conflict between Mark and Steven.\n\nThey are old enough to resolve this themselves. Not only that, they will grow by developing the skills to resolve their own conflicts instead of with your intervention. That\u2019s actually maturing, instead of learning to follow rules.\n\nLet Steven know when Mark tattles and leave it at that.

I am betting he didn't want him in there but didn't feel like his parents would make Mark leave, so he ignored him.

Whether he's looking for ways to get him in trouble or not is unclear, but it's not a one time thing.\n\nAnd the tattling isn't either.\n\nAlso, I didn't give a judgment because I believe most of the consequences here were fair, and the kids' behaviors were normal... and I don't even feel strongly on grounding Mark, one way or another.\n\nBut... I don't feel like it fits the pattern of punishment-fits-the-crime the rest had, either. \n\nI might suggest Mark not be allowed in Steven's room, at all, for at least the weekend... and if it's not already a rule, he shouldn't ever be allowed in there without Steven inviting him in. Otherwise it might be fostering resentment? Idk... tough one.\n\nMaybe Mark is encroaching on Steven's space and tattling because he misses him? But lack of privacy isn't going to make Steven appreciate his company or give him positive attention, either.\n\nMaybe a designated \"bro time\" or something? \n\nDefinitely at the least, Mark needs a chat about respecting boundaries and privacy, and about the difference between \"telling\" when something is dangerous and \"tattling\" to get someone in trouble... If it helps, I just asked what's the difference of my 13, and my kid wasn't real sure on the difference either, since it's never been a problem till now... still in the range of normal behavior, I think.\n\nI wouldn't worry with the grounding one way or the other, it sounds like the kids are doing well overall... but it is important to reach a consensus with your wife, united front and all that. \n\nThink I'm rambling now, so ... good luck!", "It sounds like you have generally good kids and your younger son is being a little bit of a shit to his brother for whatever reason.

The end of this weekend might also be a good opportunity to sit down with both of them together (along with your wife) and reflect on why they were both punished. If Mark wants Steven to get in trouble for relatively minor infractions that aren't dangerous (such as having dishes in his room), surely he understands why he was punished for a relatively minor infraction (staying up past his bedtime).

OP even admits he's breaking rules to do so, so it absolutely makes sense to punish him as well, if he's going to get his brother in trouble. I bet that would stop his tattling on little things real quick.", "I agree with op punishment. Kiddo is getting a weird vindictive pleasure/high from his actions. Hopefully, consistently punishing him will stop the habit.\n\nWhat's acceptable in the nuclear home isn't outside in the wider family or with friends.", "No, you're NTA. Mark clearly is enjoying snitching on his brother, and that's really not acceptable behaviour. Especially when the snitching was, he did something wrong and I was part of it, please punish him. Sheesh, the nerve of that kid.", "NTA What gives me bad feelings is that sometimes when Mark snitches on his brother, you actually already know, and it doesn\u2018t seem to be a big deal yet you only seem to address it with Steven because Marc told you about it. And by doing so, you give Mark wxactly what he wanted to achieve. If you find something not a big thing, let Mark watch how his snitching leads to nothing bad for Steven. Therefore, I like the idea that snitching will have bad turnout for Mark.", "NTA most kids learn in preschool that tattling isn\u2019t cool. There\u2019s of course the caveat that if there\u2019s a safety concern (drinking and driving, drugs, mental illness, etc) that telling you isn\u2019t \u201ctattling\u201d at that point. But he\u2019s simply coming to you to get his brother in trouble and that\u2019s not cool.", "Nta, he is literally looking for ways to get to him.", "YTA for using Reddit to validate your parenting. Loser.", "YTA. Sounds like Mark *has* to snitch on his brother for there to be any consequences for him at all. You seem to favor Steven and are more lenient with him. Honestly sounds like you just like him more.", "Okay please explain this to me because the number of NTAs on this thread are blowing my mind. \n\nI had this exact same relationship with my older brother growing up except I was the younger one. It was so unfair to me growing up how my older brother always got an exception to all the rules because he was difficult but when I tried to point out that it was unfair I was told it wasnt the same so somehow it makes sense to punish me for pointing out my parents rules were unfair. All this kind of parenting did was make sure that me and my older brother couldn't be in a room together without a fight breaking out until I was 27 and he told me his gf was pregnant so I decided to make an extra effort to put up with his shit so I could have a relationship with my nephew. He's still to this day the most toxic and difficult member of my family to be around. This is straight up bad parenting and just shows mark who the favorite is", "[removed]", "It sounds like you have a very different situation than the kids involved, OP makes it clear the 16yo is very responsible so he let's an occasional mistake slip, which is perfectly reasonable. He's just trying to correct the 12yo who's being a shit and trying to set his brother up and he wants to make sure they don't end up like you and your brother.", "Honestly you're nta, your system is really great tbh", "Same. Unless they were telling about something safety related, I told my kids I couldn\u2019t hear them when they tattled.", "NTA, Mark needs to learn a lesson here. He is not going to be well like at school either if he getting joy out of telling on kids for minor things like this.", "Yta", "NTA if you don\u2019t stop your younger sons snitching not only is your older son not going to want anything to do with him no one else\nWill either. No one\n Will want him around he will loose friend and family. This is very disturbing behavior. And you are right your younger son is breaking just as many rules as your older son. So if you punish one for breaking rules then. The other needs to be punished. \n\nYou could also tell your wife that you feel a bed time is a kids first curfew.  If you think about a bedtime is a time at night your expected to be at home in bed. A curfew is sit by parents also for you to be home.", "NTA - Something is going on with the younger one that makes him feel like he has to tell on his older brother or \"catch\" him at something.  I feel like you need to address that.", "Snitches wash dishes", "I agree with this.  I teach 12-14 year olds, and somewhere in the year we undoubtedly have a conversation or 3 about the difference between asking for help and snitching.  Bullies use the term 'snitch' to deter victims from accessing support.  I tell students that if you need help, I'm here for you, but if it's (weaselly voice) \"hey teacher, did you see what x did??\" (With shit eating grin) then you're looking for someone to get into trouble, and I won't support you or be an accomplice to your bullying.\n\nI also have a policy that if I keep a kid in for recess or something,  and another kid walking by makes fun of them, they get to join. If you think this situation is so fun, then I will be happy to spread it around and have you take part.\n\nOne of my main focuses is building a community that supports each other in the class at least, and I don't accept kids tearing each other down.", "Crazy how often this happens. I got flashbacks reading your comment.", "Perhaps even going as far as telling mark that he\u2019s going to make mistakes as well, literally everyone does; would he prefer Steven is given that same talk - parents want to know if it\u2019s dangerous or could harm his health but snitching for the sake of seeing someone get in trouble is problematic - or that his brother treats him the same way when they get there? He may be relying on the fact that his brother will be out of the house when he\u2019s that age, but he also may not have considered it that way.", "Oh come on. He provides three instances of Steven breaking the rules and mark gets in trouble for pointing it out in two of them. His wife thinks it's unfair and straight up says Steven doesn't follow the rules. Now he's instituted a rule where Mark gets punished for pointing out when Steven breaks the rules which he does three times in this post. In what world is Steven not the favorite here? He says he wants his kids to stick together but his method to accomplish that so far seems to by forcing Mark to cover for his brother. Forced contact is worse than no contact. Maybe mark doesn't like his brother. I hope the kid bails out at 18 and never looks back.", "They can change the rules instead of letting things slide. The boys are different ages, so they don\u2019t need to have the same rules.", "There were two instances of Steven breaking the rules, actually, and during one of those Mark was *also* breaking the rules. \n\nSteven : Kept dishes in room after dinner. Came home slightly later than curfew. \n\nMark: Stayed up past his bedtime. \n\nSteven wasn't breaking the rules to play GTA V, Mark just thought he was. Meanwhile, Mark is completely ignoring Steven's boundaries and private space by going into Steven's room to snoop around. If that isn't against a rule it sure as hell should be. Steven is 16yo and responsible, he deserves to have his privacy and personal space respected. \n\nSo, that's two for two in rule breaking. \n\nMark is being a dick. Steven is growing up and getting the rules extended for him as he earns it through responsible behavior. Presumably Mark will also get leeway when he's 16 and behaving well. That's part of growing up.", "  NTA. Where i come from if one sibling gets into trouble, the other sibling gets a beating and punished as well as the troublemaker :)) im not making this up", "YTA.you knew he had snuck in but you went along with it ..oh your punished. You should have said I know and we will deal with it.  Siblings do crap like this. You want both to be able to come to you on any situation.  I would stop punishing and or reprimanding the kids in front of one another.  This will stop the highs of little bro getting big bro in trouble.  Say we will talk about this later and carry on without the fan fare.", "NTA. I think I read this here, on reddit, but when this happens, Mark reporting you should ask him if he reports for avoid steven issues, or for cause him issues.", "The bit I don\u2019t like is that in the post it sounds like you wouldn\u2019t have given Steven any consequence for coming home a little late one time (and from what you\u2019ve said in comments it was likely to be at most a \u201cwe\u2019ve noticed this, don\u2019t make a habit of it\u201d chat). \n\nBut because Mark tattled, you did punish Steven. \n\nI don\u2019t like that dynamic at all. Sounds like Mark is controlling your parenting. \n\nBut then I would have punished *only Mark* for the third instance of tattling & openly not punished Steven: \n\n> \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t said anything Mark then I was intending to do (thing) as I normally would - but because you seem to be taking a malicious delight in tattling, I will not be punishing Steven at all this time - maybe this will help you learn the difference between tattling & asking for help (or whatever words you use to highlight the difference)\u201d. \n\nAlso, give Steven permission to keep Mark out of his bedroom unless he issues an active invitation. \n\nSteven should not have been told off for Mark watching that game unless you knew for a fact he shared it on purpose - which given you\u2019ve said he\u2019s very responsible & it was clear that it was being kept hidden from Mark, seems unlikely. \n\nIn fact - why did you feel the need to keep the game\u2019s existence a secret? Sounds like you and/or your wife are not able to use the word \u201cno\u201d to Mark. Which at 12 seems like a problem just waiting to get worse! \n\nWas it possibly your wife that wanted the game to be a secret? Does she spoil Mark a lot in general?", "NTA, or perhaps ultimately being a necessary foil as a parent in order to strengthen a bond between brothers. Playing \u201cbad cop\u201d at worst.", "NTA. I am one of three siblings. Whenever we tattled, my parents made us read the Tattling book by Joe Berry. It explained in words a 6 year old can understand that tatteling is for emergencies, and you can bet we stopped tatteling because it was not fun to read as a teenager.", "NTA \nSnitches her stitches. But seriously this is something my brothers and I wouldn\u2019t do to each other. especially for this small stuff you mind your business. The only times I remember going to my parents where when my brothers were jumping of the roof (I didn\u2019t want them to get hurt) or when my brother called me a prostitute multiple times. \nI think it is fair that your younger son learn that invading other\u2019s privacy and essentially spying on them to find dirt on them isn\u2019t acceptable.\n\nI\u2019ve actually done the opposite and snitched on myself so my brothers wouldn\u2019t be the only ones in trouble.", "NTA he\u2019s going to absolutely ruin his relationship with his brother if he continues snitching. \n\nWho wouldn\u2019t resent that? Your son sounds on the way to becoming insufferable.", "you need to get your head in the game and start punishing mark every time he tattles on his brother. not just \"talk to him\" he *enjoys* it, do you realize this? he *loves* snooping on his brother and finding something to tattle about so he can watch as you punish him. he needs to unlearn this ugly trait *pronto*.", "Beat me to it, thank you. I think this guy is just stuck projecting his own situation onto it, or his was exactly the same and he hasn't realized he was in the wrong yet"]}
