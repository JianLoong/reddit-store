We adjust patient assignments to the best of our abilities so that everyone has support. It's far from ideal for her, but she's compassionate and exceptional at her job. \n\nNot a single person in healthcare doesn't have cases that bother them to some degree. There *will* be things that stay with you, whether you like it or not. It's the downside to having human caregivers.\n\nBut maybe I'm too sensitive. Someome I used to know told me I'd be a shitty nurse because I wasn't okay with the graphic description of a child being raped in a novel I had to read for school.

It wasn't easy, but I loved my friend and I understood that this was a way of working through her grief.  But, to just arbitrarily send such pictures to someone is horribly wrong.", "NTA AT ALL.

I don't know.of any circumstance where it's ok to send explicit pictures to anyone without their permission. And it is explicit, you can't post pictures like that on social media without having a NSFW (at least) on top of it.
