My brother said he will be taking my nieces phone and to stay home more. As she used to go over to a few of her friends houses and stay for a few days. She did call me after she got home and has said she misses Rooster and she was sorry about the whole situation, that she put her and Rooster in. She said she would love to come back when she gets better. I did tell her I can\u2019t trust her around my horses and it will take a long time to gain that trust again. I told her if she does come back to my ranch, I can ask my friends to help me more around the ranch so I can teach her to ride horses and maybe get her own horse. If only I supervise her very strictly. But at the moment, she can not come back for a little while. She did cry a little but accepted it and was grateful and promised to do better and hung up.\n\nMy SIL did apologize for what she said and being upset with me. I did forgive her as we do get along greatly. She was just very worried about her daughter. My brother wasn\u2019t mad at me and knew I tried my best and wasn\u2019t mad about what Rooster did. He said it most likely was a wake up call for my niece. And I will be visiting her and flying over to the city and spending time with her for a bit during Christmas. I will make sure to spend everyday with her and make her happy. As she is the closest thing to me ever having a kid! Want her to have the best outcome!", "created_utc": 1700629879, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1811hng/aita_for_telling_my_niece_its_her_fault_that_my/", "score": 103, "replies": ["I really think she was recording herself teasing the horses to put it online. Someone needs to take a closer look at her phone to see if she's posting those things on Youtube, Tiktok, Facebook, Insta, etc. I am sure you are correct and she IS a girl who cares about animals, but social media can make you do really strange things for attention and I would strongly suggest you make sure that she has not been doing this before you allow her to come back. \n\nI'm very glad that both she and the horse are both okay, because as I'm sure you know the situation could have been a lot more serious. As it stands, you're doing everything right- just double check about the social media thing. Soooo many kids are doing dumb things they never would have done, that they KNOW are wrong, because social media encourages bad behavior in such a toxic way. If she really was just recording it for herself it's slightly less concerning in some ways and slightly more concerning in other ways. Less, because the echo-chamber effect of social media isn't a factor egging her on to things she might not really want to do, but more, because it means she was having fun tormenting the animal without outside influence.", "Part of being family, is being responsible adults around children. Leading by example, keeping true to your word, and reacting properly to bad behavior. Telling a child they made a mistake seems like abuse to some parents. But this literally could save her life. Good on you!", "#[Please Find Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vzt8h/aita_for_telling_my_niece_its_her_fault_that_my/)", "Your niece is lucky she only got kicked in the leg.", "Excellent update, great outcome!", "She is doing a lot better, there was a lot more going on but I think I rather keep it private. As I don\u2019t want to say to much on her condition. She was doing the wrong things and they\u2019re gonna take her in for more treatment. She doesn\u2019t want to but she\u2019s really got to do it."]}
