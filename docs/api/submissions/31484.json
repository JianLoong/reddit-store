My brother said he will be taking my nieces phone and to stay home more. As she used to go over to a few of her friends houses and stay for a few days. She did call me after she got home and has said she misses Rooster and she was sorry about the whole situation, that she put her and Rooster in. She said she would love to come back when she gets better. I did tell her I can\u2019t trust her around my horses and it will take a long time to gain that trust again. I told her if she does come back to my ranch, I can ask my friends to help me more around the ranch so I can teach her to ride horses and maybe get her own horse. If only I supervise her very strictly. But at the moment, she can not come back for a little while. She did cry a little but accepted it and was grateful and promised to do better and hung up.\n\nMy SIL did apologize for what she said and being upset with me. I did forgive her as we do get along greatly. She was just very worried about her daughter. My brother wasn\u2019t mad at me and knew I tried my best and wasn\u2019t mad about what Rooster did. He said it most likely was a wake up call for my niece. And I will be visiting her and flying over to the city and spending time with her for a bit during Christmas. I will make sure to spend everyday with her and make her happy. As she is the closest thing to me ever having a kid! Want her to have the best outcome!", "created_utc": 1700629879, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1811hng/aita_for_telling_my_niece_its_her_fault_that_my/", "score": 319, "replies": ["I really think she was recording herself teasing the horses to put it online. Someone needs to take a closer look at her phone to see if she's posting those things on Youtube, Tiktok, Facebook, Insta, etc. I am sure you are correct and she IS a girl who cares about animals, but social media can make you do really strange things for attention and I would strongly suggest you make sure that she has not been doing this before you allow her to come back. \n\nI'm very glad that both she and the horse are both okay, because as I'm sure you know the situation could have been a lot more serious. As it stands, you're doing everything right- just double check about the social media thing. Soooo many kids are doing dumb things they never would have done, that they KNOW are wrong, because social media encourages bad behavior in such a toxic way. If she really was just recording it for herself it's slightly less concerning in some ways and slightly more concerning in other ways. Less, because the echo-chamber effect of social media isn't a factor egging her on to things she might not really want to do, but more, because it means she was having fun tormenting the animal without outside influence.", "Part of being family, is being responsible adults around children. Leading by example, keeping true to your word, and reacting properly to bad behavior. Telling a child they made a mistake seems like abuse to some parents. But this literally could save her life. Good on you!", "#[Please Find Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vzt8h/aita_for_telling_my_niece_its_her_fault_that_my/)", "Your niece is lucky she only got kicked in the leg.", "Excellent update, great outcome!", "She is doing a lot better, there was a lot more going on but I think I rather keep it private. As I don\u2019t want to say to much on her condition. She was doing the wrong things and they\u2019re gonna take her in for more treatment. She doesn\u2019t want to but she\u2019s really got to do it.", "The good ending", "I'm really glad this ended well but I would think twice about  rearranging a bunch of stuff so that you can teach her to ride when she comes back. That kind of seems like a privilege reserved for people who've proven they can respect horses. But I'm not a horse person so maybe not", "And that said kick didn't result in a worse injury, she could have ended up with a broken leg.", "Doing the Lord's work right here.", "Yes! She is finally getting the treatment she needs to help her get better!", "Also, recording herself messing with animals could have the opposite and start getting hateful messages or getting viral as an \"animal abuser\", which could harm a teenager a lot. I hope she gets this message and learns a valuable lesson.", "I do think when she is allowed back at the facility you should have cameras up if possible. Mistreating animals is a pretty awful thing to do", "Honestly, I'd put the caveat of her continuing her treatment and *cooperating* with it as a condition for her to return to your place.  I could see her trying to say \"I only agreed to go once so I could go back to the ranch.  I'm not going anymore.\"  If the condition of cooperating with the treatment plan is in place, she can't weasel her way out of it.", "I'm glad she's getting the treatment she needs. If it hasn't already been addressed please try to convince your brother and SIL that she needs a new therapist. It's so wildly inappropriate and against all professional guidelines that her therapist is a friend of her parents. Quite frankly if her therapist has such poor judgment that she was OK with that arrangement I would question her entire qualification and training to be a therapist.", "True.\n\nI was thinking more along the lines of a cracked skull, broken sternum, ruptured spleen......\n\nThe kid was very foolish for not respecting the power of a large animal.", "Yeah, she should take note of how well abusing horses for \"hilarious\" social media posts worked out for [Solstice Pecile]( https://horsesport.com/horse-news/well-known-ontario-endurance-trainer-under-fire/). She (deservedly) had to flee the province.", "She didn\u2019t post them on any social media. As I do follow her on all her social media accounts. \ud83d\ude0c She did send them to her friends which is still not acceptable. :\\", "Don\u2019t worry her therapist doesn\u2019t tell her parents anything. She really takes her patients safety and health very serious and to make sure they\u2019re comfortable.", "Don\u2019t worry! Rooster is doing a lot better! There was a reason she told her parents and I why she did it. I am still really upset about it and pretty shocked still. But other than that. She does feel very remorseful. I believe she does."]}
