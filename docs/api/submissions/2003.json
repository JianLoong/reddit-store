And i mean since like january. In september I decided to tell my friends to save the weekend of Nov.19 for a party. They all accepted and I was thrilled.   \nFast forward to a week later, I get a wedding invite from one of the people that was invited that she was having her wedding Nov26. This is all pretty sudden as, they have already been legally married  for 7 years. \"I just wanted to have a wedding and I thought it was a good idea to do it this year!\".  \n\n\nSo I accepted as it was the next weekend after! So here I am Nov10 today, and reaching out to confirm the venue and time with everyone. And no one can make it...  \n\n\nBecause this said friend is now throwing her bachelorette party Nov19. All of the people who had previously confirmed had thought that I would just have changed it to the weekend before, or that I had known and was just going to cancel. I told them I wouldn't cancel it and change my date and if they could make it that would be great if not unfortunate.   \n\n\nI should've known that the text from friends older sister asking if I was doing anything Nov 19. was suspicious. I told her I was busy and she did not go into further detail.  \n\n\nSo here I am no invited to the bachelorette party, noone is going to come to my party. So I feel like I just don't want to show up to this wedding.   \n\n\nAITA for not changing my date?

I wouldn't be going either.", "NTA\n\nI get some people have a small wedding and a bigger do later on but having a bachelorette party after being married for 7 years is ridiculous.\n\nYou had already planned a large party which everyone was aware of. They're being rude by booking a bachelorette party the same day. It's far more flexible than a wedding day.", "NTA. I can't help but feel that this was intentional by many people. No one told you when they got a conflicting invitation, no one questioned when your new date was until asked by you if they were still good to come to the original date, and this lady randomly throws together a wedding in less than a year? Shit, when my wife and I did a vow renewal, we spent MONTHS just planning the thing, let alone booking a venue and inviting people.\n\nNo, you're not tha ahole and would not be if you told all of these people to go scratch. And don't go. Don't tell them you're not going, just f'ing ghost them. Their response will tell you what kind of friend they are.", "The lady hasn't been a bachelorette for 7 years. WTF is she talking about? You should remind her of that.

I hope you have a good time, even with fewer people than expected", "NTA. Your friends aren't really good friends. You have been planning a party for the better part of a year and suddenly someone in your friend group who has been married for 7 years needs to have a last-minute wedding that she can destroy your party?

Who needs enemies? \n\nSkip the wedding and find new friends.", "I know this sub tends to be big on \"If you rsvp yes, you must show\"... But this is a \"the exception that proves the rule\" sorta scenario.\n\nAmong other things, technically they are already doing the \"rsvp yes then no show\" thing to you. **All of them.**\n\nYes, you just gave them a \"save the date\" message. But we're talking something a couple months out and where you were asking for a preliminary headcount at the same time. Sure sounds like an informal rsvp to me.\n\nFrankly, after what they're doing to you, not sure why you'd want to attend any sort of a social gathering with any of them any time soon. Like, they sound tailor made for the saying \"With friends like these, who needs an enema\".\n\nAs for what to do those to weekends? Don't think about them at all... Pick a couple fun things to do and go do them. Anything that interests you that gets you out of the house. Extra points if you have socials and post to them so that the group knows you're not sitting at home heartbroken.", "NTA.", "Oh hello no. Those are not friends. This really seems like this was her intention right off the bat. No friend would do this especially since your wedding was planned way before she planned hers.

It really seems like this \"bride\" is trying to ruin your birthday party.  It's weird enough to have a wedding seven years later, but a \"bachelorette\" party--for a married woman?  WTF? \n\nIf you wanted to take the high road you could change your date, and see if you can get invited to the bachelorette, and go to the wedding, and act like nothing at all is wrong.  Because the unfortunate reality is, no one will be at your party on the 19th because weddings trump birthdays.\n\nThen you could have your 30th birthday party any time--apparently even 7 years later is fine!", "NTA. I was going to say you were till the part where they've been married for 7 years. They knew the date was already taken for the bachelorette. Plan it another time.", "NTA But its definitely weird to have a bach party for what is essentially a vow renewal. Tell them you're not coming and tell them why: its weird they're having a bach party and you're upset they decided to have it at the same time as a birthday party you had already had planned.

I think the only person you can be upset with is the friend who is having the bachelorette party. She was wrong for not double checking with you before she scheduled her party. She clearly didn\u2019t want your party to prevent hers from happening on the date she wanted so she went behind your back.\n\n Your other friends aren\u2019t really doing anything wrong.
