Nah she attention grabbing. Your plans were first, she shoulf have held off a little longer.", "NTA", "NTA.  It's not a wedding, it's a 7 year itch party.  Have a great birthday and enjoy your dirty thirties!!!", "NTA\n\nJust don't go. Don't say anything. And if they ask why you didn't show up respond with \"*shrug* well since you didn't tell me about the bachelorette party I assumed you also didn't want me At the 'wedding' \"", "Virtual attendance from Australia *waves*", "Burn those bridges to the ground! Don\u2019t waste your life with toxic people.", "1st if they are your friends, they know that a 30th is a big deal and will set aside the date when you tell them....you know what a good friend does. \n2nd....who the fuck has a bachelorette when they have been married for 7 fucking years...that is some bullshit and not a thing. Straight up attention seeking.\nSadly the people in your life have are just shit. Fuck them and the wedding off.", "From that one paragraph towards the end, it sounds as though the sister organised the bachelorette - would she have known about the party? OP why didn\u2019t you say WHY you weren\u2019t free that day when the sister asked; if you had she may have realised that a lot of other people would be committed to your party or, hell, you could have just said at that point that it was your 30th birthday party and a lot of the same people were invited and please don\u2019t book on that day. Was it a surprise event/date for the \u2018bride\u2019 or was she involved? If it was a surprise, would she even be expecting it as she hasn\u2019t actually been a bachelorette for seven years?! There\u2019s a lot of potential explanatory info missing. \n\nI mean, I do agree that 7 years later is beyond baffling, especially as it STILL seems to be last minute - the bachelorette only being arranged the week before it happens, like they haven\u2019t had 7 years to plan something?! And, as a guest invited to both I think I would have said to the sister that I was already committed to OP\u2019s birthday party, and so were quite a few other people rather than drop out of the previous engagement. \n\nIf the sister organised, wouldn\u2019t have known herself and wasn\u2019t told by OP, \u2018bride\u2019 or any of the other mutuals then I\u2019m not sure how to judge. It is entirely conceivable that that\u2019s the case - surprise event with surprise date. Personally, I would have just said something and they would have had to make it very clear then that they were doing it on purpose if they didn\u2019t say \u2018omg, so sorry, I didn\u2019t realise\u2019. If everyone involved did realise the date clash and went ahead anyway then NTA, and YWNBTA not attending the \u2018wedding\u2019, but I would rescind the rsvp in advance rather than just not show. \n\nSorry that was long. \ud83d\ude2c", "I'm visiting Carlisle/Harrisburg over NYE...come hang out!!!"]}
