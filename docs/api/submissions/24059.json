Concerts, parent/teacher meetings, social events, etc. Don\u2019t act like your wife is the one keeping you from being present.", "The school better have immediate access, even it its not on a computer, it should be handy the front office staff.  Our school kept all the cards together alphabetically and took no time at all to access.", "I do care about her education. When she began school, my wife and I agreed that she\u2019d be the one to manage school stuff because she had a job from home and mine requires me to be working the entire day. I\u2019d probably get a more flexible job but the one I have is the one that pays me enough to cover the tuition", "The OP literally commented to me the school his child attends does not have that level of access to documentation. There is no \"they better\" about it, they don't, It is also not in the US, so while in the US we may feel that is necessary it may not be considered so where he lives.", "Your actions says otherwise. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not involved at all.", "YTA Your daughter is 9 and you never once picked her up from school? And on top of that, you didn't think to ask your wife if you were on the list before she left on her trip? And then you made a scene instead if just asking the school to call your wife and confirm?", "Based on the comments Im going with nta. Dad's on the list, the school just refused(?) Or were unable(?) To check due to their own organizational issues. The post says they were holding the child for some amount of time refusing to allow her to go with her legal guardian... That's definitely some kinda kidnapping or custodial interference and I'd prolly threaten to call the cops, too if it had gone on for some amount of time. The school parents are mad at the wrong person. They should be on the side of a parent tryna pick up his kid.", "NTA, School should have had their shit together and IMMEDIATELY went 'Well pickle juice and beaver spit I haven't seen this guy before, let's see if he's on the approved pick up list we have every parent fill out for their child'\n\nOf course someone is going to get upset when their treated like a criminal and a monster when they just want to bring their child home. \n\nI swear reddit has some dense folk who don't even consider stuff like this. Who cares if he hasn't been to the school that often? Maybe he works a lot. Maybe the mom just likes doing it? If he sees her at home, and interacts with her there that's enough and I wouldn't take what some stranger said on the internet a second thought about how one interacts with *their* child.", "YTA \n\nMy mother who lost custody of me, could have taken me if they listened to: I'm the parent and here's her BC and my ID\n\nThere's a reason you need to be on the list. To protect ALL THE CHILDREN. Not just your own. \n\nGrow the fuck up and be an actual parent. That means knowing the school pick up policy, the fact you didn't, speaks volumes for your parenting and what you are like as a father.", "NTA.... I had to call the cops to get my kid out of class for a doctor appointment.  School said I need a doctors note. I said, \"bs, that is my kid, and I'm taking her to her appointment.\"  They said no, so I called the cops, which there is an officer on campus at all times. He came down, I explained the situation, and he told them to get my kid immediately.  And the school knows me well as I did the daytime kids stuff and all 3 of my kids went through that school. \n\nSome schools think they have more rights to your children than you do. I told my sister, who was a teacher about it, and she was flabbergasted.  Another friend is a teacher in that school, and she flat out told me the school's policies are why her kids go to a different school district.  Tell your wife that she needs to get a grip.", "NTA in this situation but you should probably try to be more involved in your kids life", "Your daughter is 9 and the school enacted their stranger danger policy because no one knew who you were as you've never picked her up before? \n\nAren't you a little ashamed/embarrassed about that? I'd hazard a guess in those 20 mins before you threatened to call the police, the school was frantically trying to get in touch with your wife to double-check. For the future you and your wife need to notify the school of changes in pick-up parents in advance. ESH", "Right? And it's not just that he's never been to the school. She's going to be friends with some of the other kids. So if the other parents don't recognize him, it means he's not spending time with her on the weekends or other times - he's not taking her to birthday parties or play dates or to hang out at the park or anything like that. No wonder they thought this was a Stranger Danger situation!", "True, but I think that makes his wife the asshole too. Because she is the one who makes all the pick-ups, and they both should have realised that changing the designated pick-up person might be a security problem for the school. Probably all it would have taken is her mentioning to the school at some point in the previous week \"Hey, I'll be away next week and my husband will be picking the kids up for a change\", and then the school would have given her the relevant forms to make sure OP was good to go.\n\nOP certainly isn't in the right, but it's rich that his wife is blaming it all on him, when he was trying to react in the moment to an unsolvable situation. Because what was his other alternative? Leave the kids at school until his wife got home days later?! About the only thing he could have done differently is to phone his wife and hope she was available to vouch for him.", "I work at a school and I'll say this: the fuss this parent describes kicking up would have taken long enough that IF the staff had walkie talkies or cell phones to communicate with the front office, then observing staff could have conveyed the events in real time, gotten confirmation that he was an approved pickup parent, and okay'd the release. \n\nTypically, it goes down like this:\n\nStudent: There's my daddy!\n\nTeacher: Uh, daddy? Where's mommy? Isn't mommy picking you up?\n\nStudent: Daddy! Daddy daddy daddy!\n\nIrate parent: Come on,  kiddo. \n\nTeacher: *silently crap crap crap* Heeey! I'm student's Teacher. I haven't had the pleasure -- you are?\n\nIrate parent: I'm her DAD!\n\n(Pick-up aide, attracted by yelling, drifts closer to the group.)\n\nTeacher: Oh! How nice! I don't think I've seen you at pick up before. Would you mind coming with me into the office--\n\nIrate parent: Are you not letting me take my daughter? \n\n(Pick up aide notifies office of incident and student involved. Requests verification of approved parent pickups.)\n\nTeacher: No, no, not at all! We have a sign out policy for first time pick ups, is all--\n\nIrate parent: But I'm her DAD. Look, here's my ID. See, same last name. C'mon, honey, come to daddy. \n\n(Pick up aide confirms parent ID to office.)\n\nTeacher: I see that, but we just need to go to the office first to sign ou--\n\n(Office confirms irate parent is approved pickup to pick-up aide, who signals the Teacher.)\n\nIrate parent: Listen, if you don't give me my daughter right now, I will call the police and have you charged with kidnapping!\n\n(Teacher sees signal from pick-up aide that office has been contacted and parent pickup status confirmed. Teacher retreats from confrontation.) \n\n\"I am sorry to have kept you. Bye, student! Have a nice day-- see you tomorrow!\"\n\nUsually the parent is too caught up in their outrage to notice some of the gathered onlookers are roving pickup support staff with walkie talkies whose sole purpose is pretty much to communicate with the office and troubleshoot the many pickup miscommunications that result from parent's telling their kids one thing and the front office nothing.", "YTA for the simple fact the other parents or school staff didn\u2019t recognize you when your daughter is 9 & 3rd grade-ish\u2026 where have you been for school functions/fundraisers/sports etc that they don\u2019t know you?  As a dad, do better & be present for her - they\u2019re only young once!", "That is indeed one possible scenario.\n\nHowever, OP has said in a separate comment that he is not in the US. He mentioned that they may not even have computerized records at his child's school.\n\nI would make no assumptions about how easily the staff in charge of pickups at his child's school can communicate with staff in the office, or how quickly the staff in the office can call up the appropriate authorization.", "Yeah, I would personally be sending a formal complaint to the school that their security measures failed...along with an apology for losing your temper in the moment. \n\nBecause 1) if you're registered for pick-ups, then even if you haven't previously done that, they should be able to access and check the list. Because life isn't  always predictable and sometimes parents need to break their usual habit and use their backup plan. The school should have procedures to cope with that, and it seems they fell down on this one.\n\nAnd 2) the school shouldn't have backed down due to a threat of police. They should only have backed down when they assured themselves that your daughter was going home with a safe person.", "Yes that's true. But if he's on the list and the school failed to check the list, then they failed too. Their SOP should be \"not the usual person...ok, let's double-check the list for alternative parents/guardians who are registered\". They shouldn't have to be reminded.\n\nEveryone screwed up one way or another.", "Even if he has met the the daughters teachers and friends parents, doesn't mean that the head office or the people that happened to be there that day knew him. He has stated in other replies that he goes to recitals and knows some friends parents.\n\nIt would have been a courtesy to let the school know, but also the school should have checked the list. \n\nAlso, schools can be prejudiced against men. My husband is the primary contact on the school paperwork because he's at home, yet every time a parent is needed they contact me first simply because I'm the mother.", "If they can't call up the authorisation fast, then there's no point in having it as a security procedure.", "Exactly! \n\nWhen I was a SAHM years ago I did the drop off and pick up, but now I'm working full time and my husband handles all the school stuff because I can't. I go to concerts and open houses, so my kids teachers and some friends parents have seen me, but the head office wouldn't know me from a stranger. So just because no one knew him during that incident doesn't mean he's uninvolved. \n\nThe school should have checked the paperwork, and he should have asked them to check it before escalating it to the police. But this thread is unfairly judging his involvement.", "He didn't say he never set foot in the school. Even if he did all you say outside of pickup, that doesn't mean the head office knows him. I can't do drop off and pick up due to being the breadwinner, but I go to concerts, open house, have seen the teachers and meet friends parents. Still, the head office wouldn't know me from a stranger, and 99.9% of the school doesn't know me (big school). That's why the school should have checked their list.", "He thinks they don't. Because he hasn't done pickups before. I would lay good odds that they actually do have some sort of procedure for this - computerised or paper-based - because otherwise what is the point of filling in a form that asks you to specify allowed pick-up people?", "YTA\nOnce I was hired to babysit 3 kids and I had to pick them up from school\nWhen I arrived to pick them up, the teacher told me she never saw me before and I explained the situation so she went to look for the papers since the mother told me she war\u2019ed them. The probleme is they couln\u2019t find my name anywhere on the list of people authorizes to pick up the kids.\nYou know what I did ? \u00ab\u00a0 No problem, I will stay here until you find confirmation that I can take the kids with me\u00a0\u00bb and in the same time I tried calling the mom\nIn the end, they found my name on a copy of a list somewhere and it took 20min before I could leave\nThose security procedure are here for a reason and you need to accept them and accept the time it takes.", "dafaq did i just read? isnt there a list for exact this reason at most schools were kids dont go home by themselves?", "INFO: What proof did you provide that you were her father?", "You jumped to conclusions. According to the comments, OP has indeed registered with the school as an approved pick up, but that they use paper forms instead of computers.", "so the school instead of checking their files, just hands over the kid at mention of calling the cops.  \nthe school is the asshole.", "This is so fucking sketchy.", "Children also have parents that don't have custody. Just because your daughter said you was her dad doesn't mean they can just allow you to take her.", "Im not saying you\u2019re the AH for reacting that way. Any parent would react that way if people are trying to keep them away from their children. \n\nIm letting you know how it looks to other people and the impact it has.", "It's still unacceptable. He's one of the parents. If you're not involved in your kid's life you're a sponsor, not a parent. Definitely not a good parent. It's time we held men as a whole to a higher standard of parenting.", "Hang on, it's all his fault for not reminding the school they have records of who's allowed to pick her up? Why on earth wouldn't they check that as a matter of course in the circumstances. The fact it was on record he was allowed to pick the child up puts a completely different complexion on things.", "I would be so deeply ashamed to have a nine year old and be so minimally involved in their life"]}
