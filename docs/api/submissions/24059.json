There's your bloody reason or do you just honestly don't care about your daughter getting an education?", "Dude, stop. I\u2019m the one who manages school-related stuff for my kids, but my husband has still been to the fucking school. Concerts, parent/teacher meetings, social events, etc. Don\u2019t act like your wife is the one keeping you from being present.", "The school better have immediate access, even it its not on a computer, it should be handy the front office staff.  Our school kept all the cards together alphabetically and took no time at all to access.", "I do care about her education. When she began school, my wife and I agreed that she\u2019d be the one to manage school stuff because she had a job from home and mine requires me to be working the entire day. I\u2019d probably get a more flexible job but the one I have is the one that pays me enough to cover the tuition", "The OP literally commented to me the school his child attends does not have that level of access to documentation. There is no \"they better\" about it, they don't, It is also not in the US, so while in the US we may feel that is necessary it may not be considered so where he lives.", "Your actions says otherwise. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not involved at all."]}
