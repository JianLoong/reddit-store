However, the moment they saw you they should've looked at their files to see if your name was on there. If you had called the police, they would've been forced to look for your file and confirm so the fact that they didn't seems kind of lazy to me. If it's not easily accessible then they need a better system. Because family emergencies happen and grandma or aunt can be on the list who would never pick up the child normally but this one occasion they need because mom and dad have an emergency. I may get down voted but I'm on the pick up list for my nieces and nephew and I don't pick them up on the regular. But I carry my ID, the school cross references it and then that's it. Also too many redditors are hung up on the fact you've never picked her up and I'm not sure why. It isn't relevant to the story.
