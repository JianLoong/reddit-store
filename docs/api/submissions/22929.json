The expectation of you \u201ctreating\u201d them to an expensive meal is showing entitlement on their side. They appear to feel entitled to your money because they\u2019ve bought you things. That is not and should not ever be the case.\n\nInstead\u2026 they should be hoping you put your money away for other things that teenagers should be saving up for. College, moving out, a vehicle or vehicle expenses, etc. Whatever it might be.", "Update: I bought it anyways because I felt guilty. And the outcome was that my dad complained that he didn\u2019t get a coke, my sister said she didn\u2019t get the TEN DOLLAR sandwich she requested, my mom says Popeyes is too salty for her and proceeded to eat food that was alr in the house and my other sister said she was not hungry anymore. Waste of fucking money. Now I\u2019m irritated and they\u2019re trying to say it\u2019s because \u2018I don\u2019t like spending money on others\u2019", "Now- RIGHT NOW is the time to learn discipline with your hard-earned money. Spend some if you want as the reward for hard work, BUT dump as much as you can from EVERY paycheck into savings. When it builds up, move it to a CD or some other interest-paying account(s). Trust me, you won't regret it.\n\nNTA", "First thing to learn: NEVER tell people how much money you have.\n\nSecond: Stop offering up your hard-earned money. Your father gave you money *because you were a kid*. It **isn't** your job to pay him or your sisters back now.\n\nThird: you need to make a plan for where you are going to be keeping your money until you are old enough to open a bank account as an adult. Do not tell anyone where the money is. Once you open your checking account - the day you turn 18 - get your checks direct deposited, request email statements ONLY, create a PIN code that your family and friends can't guess and guard that debit card with your life.\n\nFourth: NEVER tell people how much money you have.\n\nYour family are shameless for actually believing that you should want to spend that amount of money on fucking Popeyes for them. \n\nNTA", "NTA. It is not your responsibility to treat your family to a meal out, end of story. It\u2019s ridiculous that they would even ask, let alone get selfish with us and try to increase the order.", "NTA, they will spend all of your earnings if you let them and claim you're being selfish to want to keep what you earned. \n\nI'd tell your dad I was reconsidering this whole job thing now until I'm out of the house as since he's having you send him gas money and buy meals for the family, there's no point working to try and save for yourself because they're just going to claim your entire paycheck and speak to you abusively for wanting to keep what you worked for.", "NTA it\u2019s your money you decide what you wanna spend it on and your a kid you shouldn\u2019t have to pay your parents back for giving you the necessities to live that\u2019s literally what a parent is supposed to do. And if your older siblings gave you money that was their choice and sweet of them and you can choose how to pay that kindness forward but it doesn\u2019t have to be with your first paycheck when you\u2019re still a kid.", "NTA- if they bought you something, that\u2019s on them. No need to reciprocate. I wouldn\u2019t expect them to buy you anything else in the future though without you reciprocating. Maybe next time they have a birthday or after you accrue some money, treat them as a thank you, but only equivalent to what they gave you. You don\u2019t NEED to do this, but just a thought", "NTA, it's your money and you're very young to be buying things for a whole family. Seems unreasonable for them to request that of you, dont feel bad standing up for yourself", "NTA. What kind of jerk would actually take gas money from his kid or expect them to take the whole family out to dinner? \n\nIn the future, don\u2019t discuss your paychecks with anyone. It\u2019s none of their business.", "NTA, my son is 20 (almost 21) and living at home while working and going to school for a tech degree. I do NOT ask him to pay for anything for me. Especially didn't ask it out of his first paychecks. He'll buy himself occasional food that he specifically wants that I usually don't buy on a grocery run. Every once in a while, he'll pay for dinner at a restaurant, but 90% of the time, my husband and I buy for him. You are a minor, and it is their responsibility to pay for you, not the other way around.", "NTA. My first job was at a fast food restaurant when I was 17. My dad picked me up after work and expected me to give him my paycheck. I gave him a burger instead. Next following paychecks, I\u2019d give a certain amount as I want to help on some bills. Later on, years after, he kept bringing up the subject and it always annoys me to hell when he makes me feel guilty about not giving him that.", "When my older 2 started making money, my only expectation was that they pay for thier own wants and save.  I did needs and still did treats, presents and dinners. Now they have on thier own treatrd me and/or our family. It was never expected nor harassment for being fed allowed.
