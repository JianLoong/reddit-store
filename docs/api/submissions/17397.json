We have a great relationship and she trusts me with a lot more than with her mom. I don\u2019t really get mad if she drinks. I definitely partied hard in high school. I teach her how to be responsible. She knows she can always call me and to never get in a car as well as some other \u201cground rules\u201d if you will. I\u2019ve picked her up from parties before and she\u2019s come home after drinking and never been wasted. She will be a bit tipsy but never have I seen her puking or stumbling or just being a complete drunk. At family parties I also let her drink a little bit under my supervision because I trust she won\u2019t get out of hand. \n\nHer senior prom is next weekend. Afterward she is going to an after party at a friend\u2019s lakehouse.  I didn\u2019t pry too much, but obviously I\u2019m aware of the fact that there will be drinking there. I didn\u2019t ask specifically but I\u2019m not an idiot. \n\nThat was all backstory for the most part. The situation at hand started when my girlfriend found a case of high noon seltzers under her bed. (Now why my gf was looking under her bed or how she saw them raised an eyebrow, but I\u2019ve decided to focus on the issue at hand) I didn\u2019t know she had them, but when asked she said they\u2019re for after prom. Again I didn\u2019t really take an issue with this. \n\nMy girlfriend is very upset with me. She says that one thing would be assuming they\u2019re drinking and leaving it at that. But since I SAW the alcohol she plans on bringing, that as a parent it is my responsibility to do something. \u201cSomething\u201d according to her, is calling parents and telling them about the alcohol I found and basically blowing up the entire party. \n\nSimply put, I don\u2019t want to do this. I had another talk with her about being safe and that I\u2019m a phone call away if she needs me (the house is about an hour away so not terribly far). I\u2019m still planning on letting her go.

Sounds like your gf is basically trying to control what your daughter does and was looking for a reason to try and keep the daughter home or get her grounded. I'd be asking why she was in your daughter's bedroom and why she felt she had any right to be snooping in there.", "NTA - a girlfriend does not a stepmother make. She is not a co-parent in this situation and she shouldn't be dictating to you how you parent. Whether she disagrees or not is a moot point. You've talked to your kid about safety and ground rules. You've done your job. Maybe she would've done something differently, but that's not up to her.\n\nFrankly, I don't think what your gf did should be swept under the rug. Why the hell was she looking under your kid's bed? That needs to be the focus of this.", "NTA, but I would look in to how she got the alcohol.  Occasional drinking at a high school party when you are just raiding alcohol that's already there and being responsible is not a huge issue to me.  Having/trying to use a fake ID or transporting alcohol while you are underage is a whole different story and could lead to actual trouble.", "NTA. And in fact I would hazard to say that you're a good parent. \n\nAs you're aware, kids are going to party and do dumbass kids stuff. The best you can do is guide them through and give them a soft place to land. Since she knows she can count on you to come and get her, she is already safer than most teenagers who have judgemental parents and are afraid of contacting them in unpleasant situations. \n\nReiterate with her how to keep herself safe and that you are only a phone call away. That's good parenting.", "I\u2019m going with NTA on this one. \n\nEveryone likely knows they\u2019re planning on drinking after prom because that seems to be the norm, and as long as they\u2019re safe/supervised it shouldn\u2019t be an issue. \n\nThe biggest issue is your gf snooping in your daughters room - I wouldn\u2019t over look that. Who knows what else she\u2019s doing when no one\u2019s around.", "I think you need to look up the penalties for adult liability for underage drinking in your jurisdiction.", "Unpopular opinion but I understand your gf\u2019s concern. When I was in high school there were two instances of my classmates dying after leaving a party and getting into an accident. It was shocking because they were generally responsible kids. I also understand your side in that you can\u2019t control what she does, but concerns over safety are valid in my opinion.", "NTA, you've created an open and trusting relationship with your child. That's wonderfully responsible and hopefully she retains that trust. Remind her of the ground rules again and be aware of the location etc. Maybe get a check in text at some stage. Your GF is NOT her parent and she has no say. Even GF was a step-parent, this decision is yours. Perhaps her Mom if she's in the picture.\nI'd discuss being open about alcohol consumption and access, however, as your daughter breached your trust somewhat.", "it sounds like you've raised your daughter to have a good relationship with you and a healthy relationship with alcohol, which is great, so NTA.\n\nthe only problem i have with any of this is that she'll be supplying other underage kids with alcohol, and *they* may not be as responsible or mature about it. for some reason it rubs me the wrong way, but i realize it's also kind of silly to say you can drink but only if other people provide it for you. maybe it just sounds like a potential liability.", "INFO: Why are you dating someone who violates your teen daughters boundaries/privacy and then tries to control how you parent your own child?", "INFO Why was your GF in your daughters room? That aside it wouldn't be the worst to remind her to be responsible and that it's more trouble for her if she's caught providing the alcohol. Since you know she has it it's just worth reminding her.", "Oof. This one is difficult.\n\nOn the one hand I don't agree with the US having such a high legal age limit compared to many other countries around the world. If a kid is old enough to fight in a war and vote, kid ought to be able to have a cold one before deploying and casting that vote in my humble opinion.\n\nOn the other, the law is the law. And the law is pretty damn clear about underage drinking and the consequences of it. If she ever gets busted at a party while underage she'll face some pretty severe penalties that could mess up her college plans or her life in general BAD. You also could face severe penalties for permitting the underage drinking and possessing of alcohol by a minor btw. \n\nSo it's great that you have that rapport with your daughter, but I'll take the karma hit and say: YTA. You need to impress on your daughter that responsible drinking is fine, and you've done well to model it for her. But choosing to break the laws she's breaking (which you are permitting her to break and hell you even sound like you're encouraging it by providing alcohol for her at parties) can wreck her life if she's caught at the wrong place wrong time, caves to peer pressure, etc. It can also wreck yours btw- supplying alcohol to a minor is not a charge to sneer at.\n\nSorry OP. I'm with the girlfriend on this one, much as I hate to say it.\n\nAnd also, you need to inform your daughter's mother about this if she's in the picture. If something happens to your daughter while she's drinking and her mom finds out you've known she was drinking/were allowing her to drink this whole time, hell hath no fury my dude...", "What age is a senior? Can we all agree to start writing ages and not school years?\n\nNTA depending on the age.\n\nLmao imagine getting salty about being asked to use ages instead of school years.

You've all been to prom I assume you all know and have participated in the after prom drinking part of the party fgs. \n\nI fear the GF may be a little jealous of your obviously close and respectful relationship with your daughter (which you only get from being a great parent btw) which is why she is trying to push the issue. \n\nPersonally I'd be reaming out the gf for going under my daughter's bed. Even if she were getting laundry as you stated in another post, she has no reason to go under your daughter's bed at all. \n\nYou need to put your foot down and tell your gf you have no issues with your daughter drinking a little as long as she calls for a lift home and isn't anymore than tipsy. And since you are her parent that will be the end of the matter, since she isn't a co parent in any capacity.", "NTA. You are totally glossing over the real issue of your girlfriend violating your daughter's privacy. There is no reason for her to be in your daughter's room, let alone searching it. That is not acceptable. You say maybe she was collecting laundry, does your daughter normally do her own laundry. No matter what, she should be SEARCHING your daughter's room and going through her belongings. How do you expect your daughter to feel safe and secure when she has no protection against girlfriends searches. \n\nYou're comfortable with your daughter's behaviour and have a trusting relationship. Don't blow it to pacify your girlfriend's need to force herself on your daughter. She should not be interfering with your parenting.\n\nThe problem is your girlfriend. She needs to be shut down and to stay in her lane. Your daughter is a senior in high school and doesn't need another mother.", "NTA. You are being realistic, you have done a risk assessment and made your decision, and you've chosen to respect your older teenage daughter's growing independence. You sound like an awesome dad. \n\nYour girlfriend is interfering, plain and simple. This is None Of Her Beeswax.", "NTA. Your parenting style is similar to mine. I have a great relationship with my now adult children.", "As someone raised with a similar approach to drinking you have with your kid, it resulted in very healthy drinking habits as I never felt the need to binge to \u201cmake up for lost time\u201d NTA and I think your partner is invading your kids privacy which is a big problem. This is how you get your daughter hiding important stuff from you because she doesn\u2019t trust your partner.", "You are making a parenting decision letting your kid drink. She sounds responsible. But the other kids have parents there that maybe would not be okay with it or other kids that may not handle drinking well. What if one of them drives a boat after or goes swimming. It could end in tragedy.", "NTA\n\nI could write several reasons why but the main point is your daughter knows no matter what she's safe and she seems to not have gone overboard when drinking which sounds like she has a very level head which is credit to you.\n\nGo Dad!", "NTA", "YTA sorry buddy but it's time to do some parenting. You don't have to \"blow up\" the party but your daughter shouldn't be going any more. It's one thing to be drinking a little at local party and another to be an hour away, unsupervised, near a body of water, planning on bringing a case of seltzers. \n\nYou're also forgetting you have a DAUGHTER and not a son. Drinking and being around drunk people puts a girl at a much more significant risk than it does a boy. You're allowing her to put herself in an incredibly risky situation because \"I used to party too\".", "YWBTA. You are enabling illegal behavior. Your daughter is underage. There could be serious legal consequences, not to mention that teens are notoriously bad decision makers. And yet you seem to be totally fine not cluing in her mom and just letting her go to a boozed up party an hour away from you.", "YWBTA. I get it that you want to be seen as cool but she's drinking which can lead to a lot of problems. You aren't teaching responsibility you are teaching addiction.", "INFO: Is your gf her mother or what does her biological mother say to the whole thing? if it is just you who has custody and you trust her then i wouldn't blow the party up nta", "No, you should be focusing on the fact that your gf was snooping in your daughter's room.  Slight ah for glossing over that...but truthfully, your GF is the AH for snooping and continuing to be an AH for insisting you do something other than what you are doing.", "Tricky one.\n\nI. I'd find out why girlfriend was 'looking'.\n2. You now know about the alcohol - does that mean you will have any culpability/blame if something goes wrong? (morally/legally)\n3.  You mentioned a lake? Water & alcohol & teens can be a bit of an accident waiting to happen.  Likewise driving.\n\nI say all this as someone who did all the underage drinking & stupidity (in a country where it's legal at 18) and had a great time.

College towns can actually be FAR more vigilant for them due to the liability and potential loss of licensing for alcohol if you get caught selling to minors.

Especially since she feels she has the right to dictate to you how to parent. If she says \u201cgrabbing her laundry\u201d it might be time to put a stop to that. Firstly, because it is now leading to problems. Secondly, your daughter is more than old enough to do her own laundry. When I was 17 I would\u2019ve lost it if people were washing my clothes, some stuff has very specific washing instructions. Plus that\u2019s a necessary life skill your daughter should already know how to do. \n\nYou need clear boundaries with your gf. She is free to have opinions about underage drinking, and if it\u2019s really about your daughters safety then fine. But for her to demand you ruin the weekend for all your daughters friends? Unreasonable. Was she never a teen who went to a party? Underage drinking is super normal especially after prom/grad and blowing up at your daughter and ruining the weekend isn\u2019t going to stop that behaviour, it\u2019s just going to drive her to do it secretly as well as alienate her from her friends AND you.

You've been doing this with your daughter for a while, so you've had a chance to observe her reaction to alcohol and you can trust she won't get all-out smashed, and you know she knows she can call you if she needs to leave, so she won't drive drunk, etc. That's all excellent. You know your kid.\n\nDo you know all the other kids? Like, I am perfectly willing to concede that you might. My graduating class was 21 kids, and even though I didn't drink outside of my parents' direct supervision in high school, I was still really familiar with all my classmates' drinking habits. That's an absolute possibility.\n\nBut I can also see a class of 1k kids generating \"friend groups\" of 50 or more all heading out to this lakehouse, and SOMEONE is going to bring an acquaintance no one else knows who is there purely to get explosively spliffed just to spite their restrictive parents.\n\nI'm with you on not blowing up the party, but you also need to consider that your daughter isn't just going somewhere to drink. She's planning to PROVIDE alcohol to people who don't necessarily know how to drink, and even if she is perfectly responsible with her own consumption, even if LOTS of other people bring alcohol, how is she going to feel if someone does cause a problem and one of the drinks they had was one of hers?\n\nYou say that \"there are horror stories about everything,\" and that's true, but like... Those are things that happen. They're not GUARANTEED to happen. A lot of horror stories aren't LIKELY to happen. But is it even worth the possibility that it COULD? This isn't \"walking out your front door in the morning\" type stuff.\n\nThis entire situation just sets up exactly like my own little horror story, and I know you probably aren't interested, but I do have a point that hasn't been brought up yet. \n\nSomeone I had known in middle school was killed by a kid coming from a prom after party. Not a friend, just a friendly acquaintance, but it was still horrible. Best information I could piece together from lots of gossip after the fact was that there was a lakehouse party, the group of kids were actually super organized about the whole thing, calculated how much each person could safely drink, poured out all their drinks in advance so they wouldn't go over their limit, and set a timer so they'd have drunk it all by a certain time so no one would still be actively drunk by the time they went home the next afternoon. So kudos to them for that. But like, still high schoolers, and they didn't realize that making plans is completely pointless when step 1 is \"start drinking hard.\" \n\nSometime during the night, somebody broke up with somebody, a girl went storming out and hopped in a car, two boys hopped in another car to follow her, and at 1AM, she ran a light, t-boned my acquaintance, striking his driver door and killing him instantly, her car spun out, and the two boys hit her driver door, killing her and resulting in one of the boys being paralyzed by an improperly-fastened seatbelt and the other going through the windshield. I think he survived, but I don't remember.\n\nBut the additional point was this: The kid whose parents owned the lakehouse unalived himself a few days later. He had sneaked the key to the alcohol cabinet, was the one who provided the alcohol, and considered himself responsible.\n\nDon't rat on the kids. I'd be leery of letting a kid I was responsible for go, but you know her, you know she won't be one of the drivers in my horror story. But do NOT let her bring a whole case of drinks to this thing. When teens are drinking, anything that goes south goes south FAST, and she doesn't need any hint of a possibility of self-blame. It wouldn't be her fault, but brains aren't reasonable, and tragedies hit hard in unexpected ways. She can provide a case of drinks in a few years when she's drinking with adults.\n\nI'd also recommend telling her to confab with the rest of the party-goers and put together a designated driver fund. Either one of their own who is willing to take a hundred bucks to not drink or a carefully-selected responsible junior. So if one of them DOES drunkenly decide they need to leave RIGHT NOW, or falls in the lake or some shit, there will be one completely sober person to talk them down, take them home, or be level-headed enough to realize that everyone getting caught is better than NOT calling emergency services in an emergency.\n\nAlso, my cats hoard my socks under the bed, so I'm completely willing to believe your gf was hunting for laundry. But if you don't have laundry-hoarding critters and your daughter isn't one of those people who hurl clothing everywhere while disrobing, I'm still saying she was being intrusive and needs a sit-down conversation about that.\n\nETA: I've never gotten an award before.

He badgered me to drink it and I literally dipped my tongue into the drink and felt woozy. I realized what was happening and I left immediately. This rock star jumped off the bus onto the sidewalk after me in a panic. I never knew if I was being prepared for him, or just his revolting assistant. 20 years later, I got my answer. \nThanks Mum. Thanks Dad. Thanks for giving a shit enough to encourage me NOT TO DRINK ALCOHOL IN MY TEENS FOR FUCKS SAKE OP.

I don\u2019t feel like I need to get into detail here, but it\u2019s a very valid reason for your daughter to be responsible with limits, know who will be at the party, and just generally be conscientious of being alone with those she may be unfamiliar with.

Both my parents and my husbands parents were never strict about alcohol. We were allowed a drink along with the family at parties or special occasions of course it was always just one or two.

We have other family members who heavily restricted alcohol and the minute their kids were legal they would get totally wrecked every time they got a chance to drink.

These people have said themselves if it hadnt been such a taboo in their home they would have learned how to handle drink better. That they can happily not drink but if they have one they know it will never be just one and is one extreme or the other.   \nI was shocked when my kids got to 16-17 and my husband was vehemently against it.

That I either said ok you can only take a couple of beers or they could sneak and get far more and stronger things and hide it from us. That their friends would all share with them. I just made sure they understood that I\u2019d be angry if they got drunk and I wouldn\u2019t be as open and trusting. Because of this they openly came to me and nothing was hidden. When i knew there would be alcohol I\u2019d always pick them up and bring them home. Most of the other parents were the same but they would tell me of the ones not allowed and how they\u2019d hide it but would always be the ones asleep next to the toilet sick for half the party and then have to make their own way home so there parents don\u2019t know. My husband wasn\u2019t happy at first but I never hid any of it. I made sure he realised I\u2019d rather know they were safe and could come to me than hide things and endanger themselves. That at least I always knew where they were and it wasn\u2019t hiding in some woods while a group of them get drunk. Once they were at that age parents let them have some alcohol at their parties but ensured they were in the house incase needed. Even though everyone always walked to each others houses on these nights the parents would pick them up and I would drive home any of their friends that needed it to.

From the gossip I got among the girls, one of the kids\u2019 brother used to hang out with them to play games told them alot about how people called them nerd, geek, etc\u2026 and they were lame for not drinking or do anything beside studying. They decided to go for it and sneak alcohol with them. 6 of them sharing 2 bottles of vodka. So anything could really happen. And when it\u2019s the lowest odd of the chance, it\u2019s the worst.", "What ludicrous bumpkin that is. Provide a source for your claim", "Drinking illegally around water. That\u2019s really scary.", ">Is an adult more likely to be able to rationalize a tragedy? Also yes.\n\nOh, so, now the likelihood of something happening matters. And I'm not sure what your \"also yes\" is even based on. Adults assume blame for things at staggering rates, especially during tragedies. Adults feel a lot more in control of their lives than teenagers, so they put a lot more thought into what could've been if only they'd (not) done X. \"Take responsibility\" is a staple of adulthood. If you've never learnt how to work through irrational guilt, because your parents actively prevented you from experiencing it, you aren't very likely to magically figure it out once you have a birthday party.", "Exactly! I can not believe some of the responses here!", "OP needs to consult the laws in their state.  Could get charged with several offenses if something happens at the party.", "I feel the same way.\n\nHow about even if OP's daughter is being as unrealistically responsible and safe as we hope, what about ALL the other party goers? Nobody else is going to get sloppy drunk, do dangerous things, start fires, get raided by the police, force themselves on her? There aren't any creepy adults showing up? I definitely feel like a party pooper saying these but.. aren't these highly likely risks exactly why you dont let children do these things?\n\nIn my eyes OP is not just letting her drink alcohol at an unsafe age, he is actively letting her walk into extremely dangerous environments. It doesnt really matter that hes a safe person she can call, he would feel the same the second shes in a situation she cant get to the phone in time.\n\nAnd i still get where OP is coming from. I agree that authoritative parenting is not only harmful but doesnt work. But i think this is an area that should have been tightened up on more..", "You should do what you do because it is the right thing, not because you are trying to be cooler than her mom. It is not a competition, you are not a teen.\n\n1 thing is accepting the reality that kids will do stupid stuff. And something else is acting like you are cool with them committing crimes. She shouldn't have alcohol, she shouldn't carry and provide alcohol. She shouldn't even drink. \n\nNow we know they will drink, someone, somehow is going to get alcohol, so your attitude regarding that is correct. But your attitude regarding a minor getting alcohol who knows how and providing it other minors it is not. Bad things don't happen until they happen. So what happens if something bad happens and your \"cool dad\" attitude backfires? As a parent you are supposed to educate, enforce limits, etc. You don't have to be unreasonable, but you don't even ask where she got it. You are going from \"cool dad\" to \"cool friend\". You are her father. If you are really cool, you should be able to ask her where she got it from, and she should be able to accept you are not cool with fake id's and such.\n\nYou are not teaching her limits. She is not being responsible. Providing alcohol to other minors, most of which won't drink in moderation, is not being responsible. Is like giving pure sugary treats to a bunny, they will eat as much as they can. Not good for them. So teach her to be responsible. And teach her that you are responsible.\n\nI do agree though, your gf seems to be snooping. And also makes no sense to forbid her to go to the after party. Your daughter only did what she is used to do around you. Although, she hid It, so again, not all that responsible. And there are limits, you can enforce them in a safe way, and she can test them. But it seems with you there are not testing limits, because you don't do anything. You need to understand how she got the alcohol.\n\nESH.", "It shows.", "Exactly. Like, shit, how will \\*\\*OP\\*\\* feel if some kid gets smashed on these seltzers he let his daughter bring, and someone dies?\n\nWould you be just as 'cool dad' about this if their plan was that everyone brings chainsaws and they're all gonna teach themselves how to sculpt cute log bears? Just as innocent, and roughly the same injury rate.", "My FILs brother drowned after getting drunk and deciding to go swimming. Alcohol and bodies of water do NOT mix, especially for teens. OPs daughter might normally be good with alcohol, but there's no telling about the other kids. I'd definitely be worried about the situation.", "I just chuckled out loud. That was well done. And the response makes it even better"]}
