We have a great relationship and she trusts me with a lot more than with her mom. I don\u2019t really get mad if she drinks. I definitely partied hard in high school. I teach her how to be responsible. She knows she can always call me and to never get in a car as well as some other \u201cground rules\u201d if you will. I\u2019ve picked her up from parties before and she\u2019s come home after drinking and never been wasted. She will be a bit tipsy but never have I seen her puking or stumbling or just being a complete drunk. At family parties I also let her drink a little bit under my supervision because I trust she won\u2019t get out of hand. \n\nHer senior prom is next weekend. Afterward she is going to an after party at a friend\u2019s lakehouse.  I didn\u2019t pry too much, but obviously I\u2019m aware of the fact that there will be drinking there. I didn\u2019t ask specifically but I\u2019m not an idiot. \n\nThat was all backstory for the most part. The situation at hand started when my girlfriend found a case of high noon seltzers under her bed. (Now why my gf was looking under her bed or how she saw them raised an eyebrow, but I\u2019ve decided to focus on the issue at hand) I didn\u2019t know she had them, but when asked she said they\u2019re for after prom. Again I didn\u2019t really take an issue with this. \n\nMy girlfriend is very upset with me. She says that one thing would be assuming they\u2019re drinking and leaving it at that. But since I SAW the alcohol she plans on bringing, that as a parent it is my responsibility to do something. \u201cSomething\u201d according to her, is calling parents and telling them about the alcohol I found and basically blowing up the entire party. \n\nSimply put, I don\u2019t want to do this. I had another talk with her about being safe and that I\u2019m a phone call away if she needs me (the house is about an hour away so not terribly far). I\u2019m still planning on letting her go.

Sounds like your gf is basically trying to control what your daughter does and was looking for a reason to try and keep the daughter home or get her grounded. I'd be asking why she was in your daughter's bedroom and why she felt she had any right to be snooping in there.", "NTA - a girlfriend does not a stepmother make. She is not a co-parent in this situation and she shouldn't be dictating to you how you parent. Whether she disagrees or not is a moot point. You've talked to your kid about safety and ground rules. You've done your job. Maybe she would've done something differently, but that's not up to her.\n\nFrankly, I don't think what your gf did should be swept under the rug. Why the hell was she looking under your kid's bed? That needs to be the focus of this.", "NTA, but I would look in to how she got the alcohol.  Occasional drinking at a high school party when you are just raiding alcohol that's already there and being responsible is not a huge issue to me.  Having/trying to use a fake ID or transporting alcohol while you are underage is a whole different story and could lead to actual trouble.", "NTA. And in fact I would hazard to say that you're a good parent. \n\nAs you're aware, kids are going to party and do dumbass kids stuff. The best you can do is guide them through and give them a soft place to land. Since she knows she can count on you to come and get her, she is already safer than most teenagers who have judgemental parents and are afraid of contacting them in unpleasant situations. \n\nReiterate with her how to keep herself safe and that you are only a phone call away. That's good parenting.", "I\u2019m going with NTA on this one. \n\nEveryone likely knows they\u2019re planning on drinking after prom because that seems to be the norm, and as long as they\u2019re safe/supervised it shouldn\u2019t be an issue. \n\nThe biggest issue is your gf snooping in your daughters room - I wouldn\u2019t over look that. Who knows what else she\u2019s doing when no one\u2019s around.", "I think you need to look up the penalties for adult liability for underage drinking in your jurisdiction.", "Unpopular opinion but I understand your gf\u2019s concern. When I was in high school there were two instances of my classmates dying after leaving a party and getting into an accident. It was shocking because they were generally responsible kids. I also understand your side in that you can\u2019t control what she does, but concerns over safety are valid in my opinion.", "NTA, you've created an open and trusting relationship with your child. That's wonderfully responsible and hopefully she retains that trust. Remind her of the ground rules again and be aware of the location etc. Maybe get a check in text at some stage. Your GF is NOT her parent and she has no say. Even GF was a step-parent, this decision is yours. Perhaps her Mom if she's in the picture.\nI'd discuss being open about alcohol consumption and access, however, as your daughter breached your trust somewhat.", "it sounds like you've raised your daughter to have a good relationship with you and a healthy relationship with alcohol, which is great, so NTA.\n\nthe only problem i have with any of this is that she'll be supplying other underage kids with alcohol, and *they* may not be as responsible or mature about it. for some reason it rubs me the wrong way, but i realize it's also kind of silly to say you can drink but only if other people provide it for you. maybe it just sounds like a potential liability.", "INFO: Why are you dating someone who violates your teen daughters boundaries/privacy and then tries to control how you parent your own child?", "INFO Why was your GF in your daughters room? That aside it wouldn't be the worst to remind her to be responsible and that it's more trouble for her if she's caught providing the alcohol. Since you know she has it it's just worth reminding her.", "Oof. This one is difficult.\n\nOn the one hand I don't agree with the US having such a high legal age limit compared to many other countries around the world. If a kid is old enough to fight in a war and vote, kid ought to be able to have a cold one before deploying and casting that vote in my humble opinion.\n\nOn the other, the law is the law. And the law is pretty damn clear about underage drinking and the consequences of it. If she ever gets busted at a party while underage she'll face some pretty severe penalties that could mess up her college plans or her life in general BAD. You also could face severe penalties for permitting the underage drinking and possessing of alcohol by a minor btw. \n\nSo it's great that you have that rapport with your daughter, but I'll take the karma hit and say: YTA. You need to impress on your daughter that responsible drinking is fine, and you've done well to model it for her. But choosing to break the laws she's breaking (which you are permitting her to break and hell you even sound like you're encouraging it by providing alcohol for her at parties) can wreck her life if she's caught at the wrong place wrong time, caves to peer pressure, etc. It can also wreck yours btw- supplying alcohol to a minor is not a charge to sneer at.\n\nSorry OP. I'm with the girlfriend on this one, much as I hate to say it.\n\nAnd also, you need to inform your daughter's mother about this if she's in the picture. If something happens to your daughter while she's drinking and her mom finds out you've known she was drinking/were allowing her to drink this whole time, hell hath no fury my dude...", "What age is a senior? Can we all agree to start writing ages and not school years?\n\nNTA depending on the age.", "NTA\nAlso, good rules for your daughter.", "NTA. You've all been to prom I assume you all know and have participated in the after prom drinking part of the party fgs. \n\nI fear the GF may be a little jealous of your obviously close and respectful relationship with your daughter (which you only get from being a great parent btw) which is why she is trying to push the issue. \n\nPersonally I'd be reaming out the gf for going under my daughter's bed. Even if she were getting laundry as you stated in another post, she has no reason to go under your daughter's bed at all. \n\nYou need to put your foot down and tell your gf you have no issues with your daughter drinking a little as long as she calls for a lift home and isn't anymore than tipsy. And since you are her parent that will be the end of the matter, since she isn't a co parent in any capacity.", "NTA. You are totally glossing over the real issue of your girlfriend violating your daughter's privacy. There is no reason for her to be in your daughter's room, let alone searching it. That is not acceptable. You say maybe she was collecting laundry, does your daughter normally do her own laundry. No matter what, she should be SEARCHING your daughter's room and going through her belongings. How do you expect your daughter to feel safe and secure when she has no protection against girlfriends searches. \n\nYou're comfortable with your daughter's behaviour and have a trusting relationship. Don't blow it to pacify your girlfriend's need to force herself on your daughter. She should not be interfering with your parenting.\n\nThe problem is your girlfriend. She needs to be shut down and to stay in her lane. Your daughter is a senior in high school and doesn't need another mother.", "NTA. You are being realistic, you have done a risk assessment and made your decision, and you've chosen to respect your older teenage daughter's growing independence. You sound like an awesome dad. \n\nYour girlfriend is interfering, plain and simple. This is None Of Her Beeswax.", "NTA. Your parenting style is similar to mine. I have a great relationship with my now adult children.", "As someone raised with a similar approach to drinking you have with your kid, it resulted in very healthy drinking habits as I never felt the need to binge to \u201cmake up for lost time\u201d NTA and I think your partner is invading your kids privacy which is a big problem. This is how you get your daughter hiding important stuff from you because she doesn\u2019t trust your partner.", "You are making a parenting decision letting your kid drink. She sounds responsible. But the other kids have parents there that maybe would not be okay with it or other kids that may not handle drinking well. What if one of them drives a boat after or goes swimming. It could end in tragedy.", "NTA\n\nI could write several reasons why but the main point is your daughter knows no matter what she's safe and she seems to not have gone overboard when drinking which sounds like she has a very level head which is credit to you.\n\nGo Dad!", "NTA", "YTA sorry buddy but it's time to do some parenting. You don't have to \"blow up\" the party but your daughter shouldn't be going any more. It's one thing to be drinking a little at local party and another to be an hour away, unsupervised, near a body of water, planning on bringing a case of seltzers. \n\nYou're also forgetting you have a DAUGHTER and not a son. Drinking and being around drunk people puts a girl at a much more significant risk than it does a boy. You're allowing her to put herself in an incredibly risky situation because \"I used to party too\".", "YWBTA. You are enabling illegal behavior. Your daughter is underage. There could be serious legal consequences, not to mention that teens are notoriously bad decision makers. And yet you seem to be totally fine not cluing in her mom and just letting her go to a boozed up party an hour away from you.", "YWBTA. I get it that you want to be seen as cool but she's drinking which can lead to a lot of problems. You aren't teaching responsibility you are teaching addiction.", "INFO: Is your gf her mother or what does her biological mother say to the whole thing? if it is just you who has custody and you trust her then i wouldn't blow the party up nta", "No, you should be focusing on the fact that your gf was snooping in your daughter's room.  Slight ah for glossing over that...but truthfully, your GF is the AH for snooping and continuing to be an AH for insisting you do something other than what you are doing.", "Tricky one.\n\nI. I'd find out why girlfriend was 'looking'.\n2. You now know about the alcohol - does that mean you will have any culpability/blame if something goes wrong? (morally/legally)\n3.  You mentioned a lake? Water & alcohol & teens can be a bit of an accident waiting to happen.  Likewise driving.\n\nI say all this as someone who did all the underage drinking & stupidity (in a country where it's legal at 18) and had a great time.

College towns can actually be FAR more vigilant for them due to the liability and potential loss of licensing for alcohol if you get caught selling to minors.

Have you actually asked her \u201cwhat were you doing in her room in the first place?\u201d \n\nThat is a valid question to ask. Especially since she feels she has the right to dictate to you how to parent. If she says \u201cgrabbing her laundry\u201d it might be time to put a stop to that. Firstly, because it is now leading to problems. Secondly, your daughter is more than old enough to do her own laundry. When I was 17 I would\u2019ve lost it if people were washing my clothes, some stuff has very specific washing instructions. Plus that\u2019s a necessary life skill your daughter should already know how to do. \n\nYou need clear boundaries with your gf. She is free to have opinions about underage drinking, and if it\u2019s really about your daughters safety then fine. But for her to demand you ruin the weekend for all your daughters friends? Unreasonable. Was she never a teen who went to a party? Underage drinking is super normal especially after prom/grad and blowing up at your daughter and ruining the weekend isn\u2019t going to stop that behaviour, it\u2019s just going to drive her to do it secretly as well as alienate her from her friends AND you.

I know OP\u2019s daughter is basically an adult but even at that age can be messy. Hell maybe gf was doing both!", "I do", "You should! Kids can be very creative.", "I do. My cats love stashing odd socks and bras under beds.", "If you wanna clean it you should since teens/kids do hide their dirty laundry under the bed pretty often.", "My husband is sometimes so tired after working his long shifts at work that he just peels his clothes off and drops them by his side of the bed before immediately passing out in bed. Then the dog wants to lay on them and he roots around and shoves them under the bed. I go under the bed for dirty laundry at least once a week due to this.", "And the ones that don't will go from thriving, constantly packed business to permanently closed overnight because they'll get hit with fines and possibly arrests. I've seen it happen when I was driving for Uber. One weekend, a part of town was hopping as always, lines of cars getting in and out, people spilling onto the street waiting to get into bars. That week, the big bar in the area got raided for providing alcohol to minors, closed down, and the whole area of town turned into a dead zone.", "Idk I don\u2019t feel like I need a list of every person attending this party.", "I trust that she won\u2019t put herself in a bad situation. She\u2019s gonna go party in the fall whether I like it or not. Should I let myself be a nervous wreck or be confident I raised her right and that she will be okay? One of those options is way less stressful"]}
