We have a great relationship and she trusts me with a lot more than with her mom. I don\u2019t really get mad if she drinks. I definitely partied hard in high school. I teach her how to be responsible. She knows she can always call me and to never get in a car as well as some other \u201cground rules\u201d if you will. I\u2019ve picked her up from parties before and she\u2019s come home after drinking and never been wasted. She will be a bit tipsy but never have I seen her puking or stumbling or just being a complete drunk. At family parties I also let her drink a little bit under my supervision because I trust she won\u2019t get out of hand. \n\nHer senior prom is next weekend. Afterward she is going to an after party at a friend\u2019s lakehouse.  I didn\u2019t pry too much, but obviously I\u2019m aware of the fact that there will be drinking there. I didn\u2019t ask specifically but I\u2019m not an idiot. \n\nThat was all backstory for the most part. The situation at hand started when my girlfriend found a case of high noon seltzers under her bed. (Now why my gf was looking under her bed or how she saw them raised an eyebrow, but I\u2019ve decided to focus on the issue at hand) I didn\u2019t know she had them, but when asked she said they\u2019re for after prom. Again I didn\u2019t really take an issue with this. \n\nMy girlfriend is very upset with me. She says that one thing would be assuming they\u2019re drinking and leaving it at that. But since I SAW the alcohol she plans on bringing, that as a parent it is my responsibility to do something. \u201cSomething\u201d according to her, is calling parents and telling them about the alcohol I found and basically blowing up the entire party. \n\nSimply put, I don\u2019t want to do this. I had another talk with her about being safe and that I\u2019m a phone call away if she needs me (the house is about an hour away so not terribly far). I\u2019m still planning on letting her go.

Sounds like your gf is basically trying to control what your daughter does and was looking for a reason to try and keep the daughter home or get her grounded. I'd be asking why she was in your daughter's bedroom and why she felt she had any right to be snooping in there.", "NTA - a girlfriend does not a stepmother make. She is not a co-parent in this situation and she shouldn't be dictating to you how you parent. Whether she disagrees or not is a moot point. You've talked to your kid about safety and ground rules. You've done your job. Maybe she would've done something differently, but that's not up to her.\n\nFrankly, I don't think what your gf did should be swept under the rug. Why the hell was she looking under your kid's bed? That needs to be the focus of this.", "NTA, but I would look in to how she got the alcohol.  Occasional drinking at a high school party when you are just raiding alcohol that's already there and being responsible is not a huge issue to me.  Having/trying to use a fake ID or transporting alcohol while you are underage is a whole different story and could lead to actual trouble.", "NTA. And in fact I would hazard to say that you're a good parent. \n\nAs you're aware, kids are going to party and do dumbass kids stuff. The best you can do is guide them through and give them a soft place to land. Since she knows she can count on you to come and get her, she is already safer than most teenagers who have judgemental parents and are afraid of contacting them in unpleasant situations. \n\nReiterate with her how to keep herself safe and that you are only a phone call away. That's good parenting.", "I\u2019m going with NTA on this one. \n\nEveryone likely knows they\u2019re planning on drinking after prom because that seems to be the norm, and as long as they\u2019re safe/supervised it shouldn\u2019t be an issue. \n\nThe biggest issue is your gf snooping in your daughters room - I wouldn\u2019t over look that. Who knows what else she\u2019s doing when no one\u2019s around.", "I think you need to look up the penalties for adult liability for underage drinking in your jurisdiction.", "Unpopular opinion but I understand your gf\u2019s concern. When I was in high school there were two instances of my classmates dying after leaving a party and getting into an accident. It was shocking because they were generally responsible kids. I also understand your side in that you can\u2019t control what she does, but concerns over safety are valid in my opinion.", "NTA, you've created an open and trusting relationship with your child. That's wonderfully responsible and hopefully she retains that trust. Remind her of the ground rules again and be aware of the location etc. Maybe get a check in text at some stage. Your GF is NOT her parent and she has no say. Even GF was a step-parent, this decision is yours. Perhaps her Mom if she's in the picture.\nI'd discuss being open about alcohol consumption and access, however, as your daughter breached your trust somewhat.", "it sounds like you've raised your daughter to have a good relationship with you and a healthy relationship with alcohol, which is great, so NTA.\n\nthe only problem i have with any of this is that she'll be supplying other underage kids with alcohol, and *they* may not be as responsible or mature about it. for some reason it rubs me the wrong way, but i realize it's also kind of silly to say you can drink but only if other people provide it for you. maybe it just sounds like a potential liability.", "INFO: Why are you dating someone who violates your teen daughters boundaries/privacy and then tries to control how you parent your own child?", "INFO Why was your GF in your daughters room? That aside it wouldn't be the worst to remind her to be responsible and that it's more trouble for her if she's caught providing the alcohol. Since you know she has it it's just worth reminding her.", "Oof. This one is difficult.\n\nOn the one hand I don't agree with the US having such a high legal age limit compared to many other countries around the world. If a kid is old enough to fight in a war and vote, kid ought to be able to have a cold one before deploying and casting that vote in my humble opinion.\n\nOn the other, the law is the law. And the law is pretty damn clear about underage drinking and the consequences of it. If she ever gets busted at a party while underage she'll face some pretty severe penalties that could mess up her college plans or her life in general BAD. You also could face severe penalties for permitting the underage drinking and possessing of alcohol by a minor btw. \n\nSo it's great that you have that rapport with your daughter, but I'll take the karma hit and say: YTA. You need to impress on your daughter that responsible drinking is fine, and you've done well to model it for her. But choosing to break the laws she's breaking (which you are permitting her to break and hell you even sound like you're encouraging it by providing alcohol for her at parties) can wreck her life if she's caught at the wrong place wrong time, caves to peer pressure, etc. It can also wreck yours btw- supplying alcohol to a minor is not a charge to sneer at.\n\nSorry OP. I'm with the girlfriend on this one, much as I hate to say it.\n\nAnd also, you need to inform your daughter's mother about this if she's in the picture. If something happens to your daughter while she's drinking and her mom finds out you've known she was drinking/were allowing her to drink this whole time, hell hath no fury my dude...", "What age is a senior? Can we all agree to start writing ages and not school years?\n\nNTA depending on the age.", "NTA\nAlso, good rules for your daughter.", "NTA. You've all been to prom I assume you all know and have participated in the after prom drinking part of the party fgs. \n\nI fear the GF may be a little jealous of your obviously close and respectful relationship with your daughter (which you only get from being a great parent btw) which is why she is trying to push the issue. \n\nPersonally I'd be reaming out the gf for going under my daughter's bed. Even if she were getting laundry as you stated in another post, she has no reason to go under your daughter's bed at all. \n\nYou need to put your foot down and tell your gf you have no issues with your daughter drinking a little as long as she calls for a lift home and isn't anymore than tipsy. And since you are her parent that will be the end of the matter, since she isn't a co parent in any capacity.", "NTA. You are totally glossing over the real issue of your girlfriend violating your daughter's privacy. There is no reason for her to be in your daughter's room, let alone searching it. That is not acceptable. You say maybe she was collecting laundry, does your daughter normally do her own laundry. No matter what, she should be SEARCHING your daughter's room and going through her belongings. How do you expect your daughter to feel safe and secure when she has no protection against girlfriends searches. \n\nYou're comfortable with your daughter's behaviour and have a trusting relationship. Don't blow it to pacify your girlfriend's need to force herself on your daughter. She should not be interfering with your parenting.\n\nThe problem is your girlfriend. She needs to be shut down and to stay in her lane. Your daughter is a senior in high school and doesn't need another mother.", "NTA. You are being realistic, you have done a risk assessment and made your decision, and you've chosen to respect your older teenage daughter's growing independence. You sound like an awesome dad. \n\nYour girlfriend is interfering, plain and simple. This is None Of Her Beeswax.", "NTA. Your parenting style is similar to mine. I have a great relationship with my now adult children.", "As someone raised with a similar approach to drinking you have with your kid, it resulted in very healthy drinking habits as I never felt the need to binge to \u201cmake up for lost time\u201d NTA and I think your partner is invading your kids privacy which is a big problem. This is how you get your daughter hiding important stuff from you because she doesn\u2019t trust your partner.", "You are making a parenting decision letting your kid drink. She sounds responsible. But the other kids have parents there that maybe would not be okay with it or other kids that may not handle drinking well. What if one of them drives a boat after or goes swimming. It could end in tragedy.", "NTA\n\nI could write several reasons why but the main point is your daughter knows no matter what she's safe and she seems to not have gone overboard when drinking which sounds like she has a very level head which is credit to you.\n\nGo Dad!", "NTA", "YTA sorry buddy but it's time to do some parenting. You don't have to \"blow up\" the party but your daughter shouldn't be going any more. It's one thing to be drinking a little at local party and another to be an hour away, unsupervised, near a body of water, planning on bringing a case of seltzers. \n\nYou're also forgetting you have a DAUGHTER and not a son. Drinking and being around drunk people puts a girl at a much more significant risk than it does a boy. You're allowing her to put herself in an incredibly risky situation because \"I used to party too\".", "YWBTA. You are enabling illegal behavior. Your daughter is underage. There could be serious legal consequences, not to mention that teens are notoriously bad decision makers. And yet you seem to be totally fine not cluing in her mom and just letting her go to a boozed up party an hour away from you.", "YWBTA. I get it that you want to be seen as cool but she's drinking which can lead to a lot of problems. You aren't teaching responsibility you are teaching addiction.", "INFO: Is your gf her mother or what does her biological mother say to the whole thing? if it is just you who has custody and you trust her then i wouldn't blow the party up nta", "No, you should be focusing on the fact that your gf was snooping in your daughter's room.

I'd find out why girlfriend was 'looking'.\n2. You now know about the alcohol - does that mean you will have any culpability/blame if something goes wrong? (morally/legally)\n3.  You mentioned a lake? Water & alcohol & teens can be a bit of an accident waiting to happen.  Likewise driving.\n\nI say all this as someone who did all the underage drinking & stupidity (in a country where it's legal at 18) and had a great time.

Have you actually asked her \u201cwhat were you doing in her room in the first place?\u201d \n\nThat is a valid question to ask. Especially since she feels she has the right to dictate to you how to parent. If she says \u201cgrabbing her laundry\u201d it might be time to put a stop to that. Firstly, because it is now leading to problems. Secondly, your daughter is more than old enough to do her own laundry. When I was 17 I would\u2019ve lost it if people were washing my clothes, some stuff has very specific washing instructions. Plus that\u2019s a necessary life skill your daughter should already know how to do. \n\nYou need clear boundaries with your gf. She is free to have opinions about underage drinking, and if it\u2019s really about your daughters safety then fine. But for her to demand you ruin the weekend for all your daughters friends? Unreasonable. Was she never a teen who went to a party? Underage drinking is super normal especially after prom/grad and blowing up at your daughter and ruining the weekend isn\u2019t going to stop that behaviour, it\u2019s just going to drive her to do it secretly as well as alienate her from her friends AND you.

You've been doing this with your daughter for a while, so you've had a chance to observe her reaction to alcohol and you can trust she won't get all-out smashed, and you know she knows she can call you if she needs to leave, so she won't drive drunk, etc. That's all excellent. You know your kid.\n\nDo you know all the other kids? Like, I am perfectly willing to concede that you might. My graduating class was 21 kids, and even though I didn't drink outside of my parents' direct supervision in high school, I was still really familiar with all my classmates' drinking habits. That's an absolute possibility.\n\nBut I can also see a class of 1k kids generating \"friend groups\" of 50 or more all heading out to this lakehouse, and SOMEONE is going to bring an acquaintance no one else knows who is there purely to get explosively spliffed just to spite their restrictive parents.\n\nI'm with you on not blowing up the party, but you also need to consider that your daughter isn't just going somewhere to drink. She's planning to PROVIDE alcohol to people who don't necessarily know how to drink, and even if she is perfectly responsible with her own consumption, even if LOTS of other people bring alcohol, how is she going to feel if someone does cause a problem and one of the drinks they had was one of hers?\n\nYou say that \"there are horror stories about everything,\" and that's true, but like... Those are things that happen. They're not GUARANTEED to happen. A lot of horror stories aren't LIKELY to happen. But is it even worth the possibility that it COULD? This isn't \"walking out your front door in the morning\" type stuff.\n\nThis entire situation just sets up exactly like my own little horror story, and I know you probably aren't interested, but I do have a point that hasn't been brought up yet. \n\nSomeone I had known in middle school was killed by a kid coming from a prom after party. Not a friend, just a friendly acquaintance, but it was still horrible. Best information I could piece together from lots of gossip after the fact was that there was a lakehouse party, the group of kids were actually super organized about the whole thing, calculated how much each person could safely drink, poured out all their drinks in advance so they wouldn't go over their limit, and set a timer so they'd have drunk it all by a certain time so no one would still be actively drunk by the time they went home the next afternoon. So kudos to them for that. But like, still high schoolers, and they didn't realize that making plans is completely pointless when step 1 is \"start drinking hard.\" \n\nSometime during the night, somebody broke up with somebody, a girl went storming out and hopped in a car, two boys hopped in another car to follow her, and at 1AM, she ran a light, t-boned my acquaintance, striking his driver door and killing him instantly, her car spun out, and the two boys hit her driver door, killing her and resulting in one of the boys being paralyzed by an improperly-fastened seatbelt and the other going through the windshield. I think he survived, but I don't remember.\n\nBut the additional point was this: The kid whose parents owned the lakehouse unalived himself a few days later. He had sneaked the key to the alcohol cabinet, was the one who provided the alcohol, and considered himself responsible.\n\nDon't rat on the kids. I'd be leery of letting a kid I was responsible for go, but you know her, you know she won't be one of the drivers in my horror story. But do NOT let her bring a whole case of drinks to this thing. When teens are drinking, anything that goes south goes south FAST, and she doesn't need any hint of a possibility of self-blame. It wouldn't be her fault, but brains aren't reasonable, and tragedies hit hard in unexpected ways. She can provide a case of drinks in a few years when she's drinking with adults.\n\nI'd also recommend telling her to confab with the rest of the party-goers and put together a designated driver fund. Either one of their own who is willing to take a hundred bucks to not drink or a carefully-selected responsible junior. So if one of them DOES drunkenly decide they need to leave RIGHT NOW, or falls in the lake or some shit, there will be one completely sober person to talk them down, take them home, or be level-headed enough to realize that everyone getting caught is better than NOT calling emergency services in an emergency.\n\nAlso, my cats hoard my socks under the bed, so I'm completely willing to believe your gf was hunting for laundry. But if you don't have laundry-hoarding critters and your daughter isn't one of those people who hurl clothing everywhere while disrobing, I'm still saying she was being intrusive and needs a sit-down conversation about that.", "We don't anything about how long you've been dating or you GF's relationship to your daughter so take this with a grain of salt and not even that unless this relationship is sorta new.

You *need* to be asking a *lawyer* what kind of legal trouble could I and my daughter get into if I turn the other way. \n\nGrow up and be the adult smh. \n\nESH except for the daughter", "Someone with common sense in all this.", "I suspect he's the \"fun parent\" so she'll like him more,  which leaves Mom having to establish boundaries. \n\nHm, wonder if that's a longstanding pattern.", "You are taking being \u201cthe cool dad\u201d way too far. My parents were overbearing helicopter parents and guess what? I didn\u2019t drink or try drugs or even go to parties if there was a chance they could get rowdy because I was *terrified* of my parents\u2019 *disappointment.* They didn\u2019t have to ground me or threaten me, the idea that I\u2019d make a bad choice and they\u2019d be *disappointed* was enough. The idea of calling my dad to give me a ride because everyone was drunk? That idea still gives me chills because I can hear the lecture I would have gotten. \n\nNot all good parents are cool parents, and not all parents who basically say \u201cdon\u2019t do this thing\u201d have it backfire.", "I have a suspicion that folks in this comment section haven\u2019t used or had friends use fake IDs in college towns.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Even if the kid chooses to drink themselves to the point of poisoning, the cops are going to want to know where they got it. And there are a lot of charges that go with fake IDs and providing alcohol to minors.", "There is nothing wrong with going to a party. It is what is going on at the party with underage drinking", "half of AITA is like \"projecting 101\"", "Dont let yourself in a room is not yours, and definitely never if the person whose bedroom belongs to, hasn\u2019t approved!", "I've lost count of how many socks my wife has kicked under the bed without noticing.\n\nIf I don't check under our bed I won't get all of the dirty clothes, and she'll run out of socks", "Yup, finally, instead of all these teenagers and \"cool parents.\"", "She sounds like dad the cool dad", "I don\u2019t think he likes asking the hard questions, period.", "Exactly! The socks always get under there somehow.", "Does she vacuum for your daughter? That would have likely had her looking under the bed.", "This is a tough choice.  I understand what people are saying about trust and openness.  Sometimes, particularly if there are gatecrashers, these parties can get out of hand.  It's not like I've never heard that the police raided a place and made arrests, including of the parents.\n\nI hope your daughter has sensible friends, or sense enough to call if things deteriorate.", "Bullshit. I went to college and didn\u2019t party, partly because of the statistics around SA on college campuses. The ONE time I let my guard down and drank a little too much was the ONE time I was assaulted (small group setting, as I engaged in harm reduction heavily). A friend of mine was routinely assaulted by her boyfriend\u2019s friends at parties though, which was another reason I stopped going to parties.", "No one chooses to put themselves in a bad situation. I recently got roofied while on a Moms night with a friend. We were having drinks in a popular pub. Luckily she didn\u2019t get roofied and managed to get me back to the hotel, but 1/2 my night is gone along with half a tooth (from losing all motor function) and that was the worst thing that happened. \n\nWe weren\u2019t partying with anyone. Just sitting at a long table. \n\nI\u2019d make sure she is 100% aware that she needs a buddy and hopefully neither of them experience the same thing. \n\nHad my friend not got me back, I wouldn\u2019t have known if anything happened to me at all. I woke up with half a tooth missing and I was in different clothes because I had been sitting in the shower with my clothes on and my friend helped change me. \n\nJust tell her to be careful. People are using Benzos to drug others, and nowadays a lot of fake Benzos (and other party drugs) have fentanyl in them. If you can, send her group with a Naloxone kit. \n\nIn my job, I\u2019ve given out a bunch of them to teens for their partying. It\u2019s rampant right now. And that\u2019s not fear mongering. \n\nAre you at all able to be any closer? Like, rent a hotel room nearer just in case? Make sure all her friends know you\u2019re only a little away in case any of them need help. Or is there going to be an adult anywhere near to help in an emergency?", "Look up \u201cdenial.\u201d She\u2019s a kid. Her judgment could fail her. \n\nWorse, she could be victimized. And frankly, as someone who grew up around drinking and who drinks as an adult, I think you\u2019re making it sound like she drinks a bit excessively for her age  with your support, no less. \n\nAt the very least, don\u2019t aid and abet her supplying liquor to other kids.", "She illegally obtained alcohol that she was going to illegally supply other kids with. You didn\u2019t raise her right.", "In my town, if the cops get called, the adults get arrested, and anyone they can find that provided alcohol, gets arrested.  OP, absolutely would be, in my town.", "Exactly. Life is harsh and unforgiving enough, I can at least offer them comfort and ease while they're still under my roof. All of mine are perfectly capable and responsible young adults, but I'll still pick up their laundry off the floor if I'm doing laundry. But they also bring me a cup of coffee in bed when they're up before me, because they like making my life easy too."]}
