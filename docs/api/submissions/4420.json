One night my dad and stepmom ubered into town to go bar hoping. They asked if I could pick them up with my stepmoms car when they were done, which I reluctantly agreed to. \n\nAbout 10pm that night (after roughly 5 hours of them drinking), my dad texts me so I head out to pick them up. I pull into the back parking lot of the bar they were at only for them to start yelling at me that I should\u2019ve just picked them up out front (there was no space to pull up so I\u2019d be blocking traffic if I did this). Then the whole time we\u2019re driving home, stepmom starts screaming at me to \u201cslow down\u201d and \u201cstop speeding\u201d even though I\u2019m well within the speed limit. She then keeps yelling at me to stop accelerating, but my foot is nowhere near the accelerator and we are driving down hill, and I tried to stand my ground by telling her this. My dad chimes in and scolds me that if I were to crash their car he\u2019d ask my mom to \u201cpay half\u201d for a replacement. They continued to scream at me the rest of the way home, so once we got back I parked in the driveway and ran up stairs to collect myself and cry it out. I could hear stepmom slamming doors and running around the upstairs looking for me to get her \u201cI\u2019m right!!\u201d validation that she usually tries to get when she\u2019s clearly in the wrong. \n\nThe next day my dad tries to reassure me she was only trying to keep me safe on the road and that he sees young kids getting hurt/killed in accidents all of the time with his job.

I'm surprised that you didn't pack upon getting to your room and then leave, first thing in the morning. \n\nTheir screaming at you was little more than abusive. Instead of apologizing for their drunken tirade, your father is topping things off by gaslighting you. Only you can decide not to tolerate this.", "NTA - Let them pay for an Uber next time.", "NTA \n\n\nMy dad did this to me once. \n\n\nWe drove the entire way home at 5mph. You know, just to be safe. When he told me to stop being silly, I was all \"no, you're right, it's important I drive safely\" and he was just seething. Internally, instead of getting annoyed at him and upset, I was laughing my tits off.\n\n\nI am petty AF with that shit.", "NTA.  \n\nWhen someone is drunk and angry and yelling, 'not listening' to them is usually the right answer.  \n\nI'd tell them both, respectfully, that you are happy to help them but the way they treated you while drunk was not acceptable.  So next time, they should call an uber.", "NTA. I'm actually so sorry that you had to go through that and then doubt yourself in the aftermath of their drunken tangents. As the adults they should have apologised the next day, not made excuses for emotionally abusing you after you did a FAVOUR for them. Again, I really hope you're doing ok. <3", "NTA.. next time they can Uber home.", "NTA, and yikes, your parents are not happy drunks. \n\nI\u2019m also\u2026 okay, I hope someone else will weigh in, because I grew up in a house where my parents would never have gone to a bar, let alone drank for five hours and asked me to be their ride home. I, personally, feel like your dad and stepmom might have a drinking problem, but my personal experience is too skewed for me to know.", "NTA.  Never engage in arguments with people who are drunk.  It is pointless and can become dangerous.\n\nIt's insanely irresponsible to shout and scream at a person while they are driving.  I would have pulled over and left them in a parking lot so they could call an Uber.\n\nIt's difficult for people to admit they were a drunken asshole.  They will desperately cling to the fiction that They Were Right, or They Were Only Watching Out For You, or very irritatingly, I'm Older Than You So I Am Always Right.  Your dad was engaging in this self-deception.  \n\nIt's okay to say to your dad, \"You weren't watching out for me.  There was nothing wrong with my driving.  You were being an obnoxious drunk, and it would be a good idea for you to get that under control.\"\n\nThey were the assholes, and they doubled down on it afterwards.\n\nDo not agree again to give them rides anywhere, anytime, if they've been drinking.  Tell them, \"No.  You criticized and complained about my driving ability, so you'll have to find someone else to help you.\"  And do not back down or give in.  Say No until they go away.", "NTA, and inform them you will never be their ride again when their drunk. Or ever. Like other adults, they can Uber/Lyft to and from the bars and scream at the driver who is getting paid for it.", "NTA but I wouldn't ever do favors for them. Yikes. Sorry you went through this. I would have started screaming at her. And I love how your dad calmly tried to justify her behavior. Guess we have an enabler out here.", "NTA. Drunks are a special breed of TA and there's no winning. They should have just Ubered home. \n\nFYI in case they pull this shit again, driving noticably under the speed limit can be an excuse for police to pull you over, especially late at night, as it looks suspicious or that you are unable to maintain control of the vehicle under normal operations. If you haven't been drinking and otherwise are obeying traffic laws you will probably be fine. But you can almost garauntee the the driunks will maek drama over it, even if the officer lets you go.", "NTA", "Yikes. I'm sorry. NTA\n\nIt's time to set boundaries. You have enabled their behavior by being compliant with their demands (pick us up after binge drinking). Next time, don't. \n\nDon't reward their behavior, don't participate, don't comply. Set boundaries now. It will be tough at first, but you'll be so thankful down the road.", "Ah. Next time, stop the car, and ask them to get out and call a taxi. Don\u2019t argue, just wait. ;-)", "NTA  I would have stopped the car and told their drunk asses to get out and start walking. You were doing them a FAVOR,  You didn't need a backseat driver, and they were being aggressively disrespectful and rude.  As if drunk people are ever situationally aware?!

Eventually they passed out and I drove them home, but left them in the car to sleep it off.\" And then we can all argue about temperature and attire while we decide if it was attempted murder. \n\nNTA", "NTA. With them yelling at you driving, I would have pulled and stopped the car turn off the engine and toss the keys to your dad and walk home. They sound toxic", "NTA, and never give them a ride ever again. They can take a taxi so at least someone\u2019s getting paid for their backseat driving.\n\nSeriously this is dangerous. Your stepmom was actively distracting you from driving, didn\u2019t stop when asked and only escalated when confronted. She\u2019s going to cause an accident at some point with these antics.\n\nMy dad pulls the same thing with me because he literally teaches defensive driving to truckers. One time I was the family designated driver and on the way home he yelled about me pulling into a center turn lane, almost causing an accident. I pulled over, got out of the car and told him he could walk or take a taxi, but I wasn\u2019t driving him anywhere. He grumbled, but I keep the rule. If he\u2019s in the car he drives, and if he\u2019s too impaired we take a taxi/uber.", "That was awful of them !Here\u2019s a tip for all of us - don\u2019t pick up drunks!  YNA", "NTA.  Wait for her apology  for her drunken behavior.  If you don't get it, tell them to Uber home if your driving is so bad.", "NTA\n\nMy stepmother did exactly the same thing, lol.

It\u2019s not like they were 17. \n\nThe dad\u2019s and stepmom\u2019s attitude is horrendous but asking your adult child for a ride after a special occasion is responsible, especially if the parents did/do the same for the (adolescent/grown up) child. If it happens a lot, especially if they have that attitude each time, then it would point more to a drinking problem.\n\nOP, NTA. Your dad is clearly lying to you about your step-mom\u2019s intention because he realized they were the worst. Yelling and berating someone who is driving is probably one of the best way of distracting them. Congrats for keeping your cool under pressure.

Calling your adult child is better than drinking and driving. And really, there\u2019s not a big difference in the maturity levels of 17 and 24 year olds. Some, but not huge. \n\nThe reality is that children never stop watching their parents to see how to react, what\u2019s acceptable behavior, how to navigate life.

A 17 y/o falls into the upper limits of Erikson\u2019s Identify vs Role Confusion stage (12-18). A 24 year old is at the lower end of Intimacy vs Isolation (18-40). There is some difference in the emotional maturity, but not as big a gap as there is from the other stages at the lower and higher ends.", "Yeah, some numbers are farther apart than 17 and 24. That doesn't mean that the differences between the two aren't important. Imagine a 24 year old was dating a 17 year old. The difference is pretty apparent now right?", "Yeah Erikson\u2019s stage theory has never and never will be proven. It\u2019s a generalized description of what he thought people should accomplish at different age. You can\u2019t summarize one stage of life, sometimes as long as decades, to one \"conflit\". \nI really like the fact that you think that 24 year-olds are not more mature than 17 year-olds in general. The 24 year-old has 7 more years of experience, has probably gone to college/university/professional school, moved out, maybe even has kids\u2026 the 17 year-old IS a kid legally and developmentally (or an adolescent if you want to contrast with younger kids). \n\nThere is nothing shameful in having a good time even if alcohol is involved.
