ASAP.\n\nI grew up with a sibling who was controlling, violent, and manipulative. I'm almost 40 and still have severe PTSD. Granted in my case there was a significant age gap but you need to take this very seriously. She's willing to jettison her entire relationship with her mother over this.\n\nLook into the effects of domestic violence, because that could be what you're dealing with here: violence towards your daughter in a domestic setting. Look into how damaging it is for victims when they're trapped in the same environment with their abuser for long periods of time. She had one escape: you. And you just took that away.\n\nI wouldn't be worried that she's angry at you. I'd be worried about her beginning to self harm.\n\nIf it turns out to be the other way around and she's the aggressor, you need to be on top of that too, while she's still a minor.

My dad never had much interest in me and my time spent at his house was boring. My friends were near mom's, he wouldn't let me talk on the phone to them (it was long distance to call to where I lived with mom), and there was nothing to do except watch whatever the antenna got on the TV upstairs (he had control of the TV downstairs that was on cable).\n\nMy solution was to just get so involved with activities that I \"couldn't\" visit on his weekends. Sorry, dad, I'm at a speech tournament from Friday at 4 PM to Sunday at 5 PM. If you pick me up, I could have dinner with you (did he show up to the speech tournament? HAHAHAHA!). I have a dance competition this Saturday, it's at XYZ place, I'll be done around 6, if you pick me up, I can spend the night (did he show up to the dance competition? HAHAHAHA!). \n\nBut there was no serious abuse of me, just general disinterest. I didn't want to be there because he only wanted me there for some \"paper win\" and so I found a way to not be there. He tried to sue because he lost all his time, but admitted that he would not take me to the activities, and when I testified that I wanted to be in all those activities, case closed. He could only demand his visitation rights if I made it to school in my home district and all activities I chose to participate in. Since he wasn't willing to drive 20 minutes to take me to or from those activities, he willingly forfeited his visitation. And then I got to spend my weekend evenings with my local friends!", "That happens much more often than people realize.

I know 4 other kids who didn\u2019t tell because they knew their Dad would react in a way that would cause more family harm.

I couldn't prove in court that he was abusive so she had to go.\n\nIn most cases, the courts make the decision to have the child maintain a relationship with both parents because it is usually in the best interest of the child. Teens can get mad at one parent for reasons other than abuse. So the adults make decisions for them. Teens learn to manipulate the divorced parents and play them off each other. So for many reasons, there are custody agreements.\n\nThe last year I was supposed to send my daughter, I just couldn't do it. Her dad threatened me with jail (that can happen) and I told him to go ahead. He was not a good man and I just couldn't do it. There's much, much more to it but I'll stop there.", "Inaccurate. I chose to fully stop visiting my father of my own accord when I turned 13. There was no abuse involved. I didn\u2019t have to provide a reason.

When she and her ex boyfriend first started dating his ex girlfriend was pregnant (they didn\u2019t know when they broke up). A couple years later my cousin had a son with him. The two kids spent three weekends a month together for years, then my cousin and her boyfriend broke up. About a year later they all ended up living in different apartments within the same building, so now the kids can see each other and each of their parents way more often.", "Second this x1000", "YTA. She is telling you something is going on. Is there a stepfather, stepbrother, Uncles..... You need to sit down and LISTEN TO HER, don't interrupt, don't judge.", "OP, if a kid is so adamant about not wanting to go to someone's household for years, there's definitely a reason. \n\nMy aunt has 4 kids. The first two are from two baby daddies she is no longer with, and the last two were with the man she ended up marrying. The younger two are the golden son and daughter, and the older son and daughter (who we will call Stephen and Carly) are essentially neglected and emotionally abused. I'm around the age of the oldest two, so I was pretty much kept in the dark about how messed up the situation was until I was in high school. \n\nStephen would get picked up by his dad on holidays pretty often, and according to my parents, his dad genuinely cares about him and is a decent guy. So he at least has one safe household. \n\nI was never super close with Carly and was very nervous when I found out our grandma had convinced her mom to force her to go on a youth group retreat with me. I kept an open mind, but I had barely seen her since we were little and this was a Catholic retreat with people I'd built up a good reputation with, and I knew she could be a bit rough around the edges (and this was before I knew the extent of her situation). Throughout the retreat, there were plenty of times we talked in small groups and basically had group therapy sessions together where I learned a lot about Carly and her rough home lives. Talking to my mom after the trip about it (because I was concerned about her well-being) filled in more of the gaps. \n\nI knew my aunt was a pretty shitty parent already (even her golden children aren't spared from her constantly saying she can't wait to be an empty nester), but I had learned just how extremely unwanted she made Stephen and Carly feel. And she knew how much Carly struggled with mental health but didn't care enough to actually do anything about it. \n\nAnd before that trip, I didn't know anything about her dad. Apparently, her dad was married, and they had a son who was their golden child, so they didn't want Carly either. She basically just got passed back and forth like a hot potato by two sets of parents who didn't really care about her. And then I learned about her running away from home frequently, and how her parents would talk about how they didn't know where she was with complete disdain. And I learned about her self harm and s**cide attempts. \n\nAnyway, OP, my impression of your post is that up until now your daughter was like Stephen, who had at least one loving parent and safe home. If you continue to burn this bridge with her, she will fall into Carly territory, and I hope to anything that you do not allow that to happen to that poor girl. I'd be willing to bet that your ex is not providing a safe space or suitable home life for your daughter, and you may be the only thing keeping her alive, sane, and happy right now. Please, *please*, don't jeopardize that. I would do anything to go back in time and remind Carly just how loved and wanted she is by me and all our surrounding relatives. I'm someone who has felt some of the pain Carly has, and I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemies. Please take this as a wake up call, and anyone else reading this, tell your friends and family that you love them. You never know if you're the only one to ever say it to them and mean it", "Any child of divorce is always going to have that little voice in the back of their head wondering whether they are just collateral damage to their parents. Obviously you should be concerned about why your daughter is unwilling to visit her mother, instead of judging her. There could be something serious going on. But on top of that, my heart hurts for how unwanted she must have felt when you threatened to revoke her home at your house. Shame on you.", "YTA - if for no other reason than by threatening her with the original custody agreement you showed her neither of her parents can be trusted and that to some extent you're both unsafe. \n\nYour daughter is trying to avoid her other parent and it's \"oh well you have to or I will force you to be there far more frequently\". What are you unintentionally teaching her? Did you even consider that? Think it might be something like - suffer through things you shouldn't because it's the rules? Or that her autonomy isn't really that important? Maybe that her voice means nothing? Perhaps even that she shouldn't trust her gut instincts because clearly they're wrong? \n\nHow do you think this will play out in other relationships later in her life?\n\nConsider family therapy for the two of you. That way you can learn how to listen to her and see her as a person in her own right. And she can have a safe adult around who will actually listen to the things she needs to tell you while you learn how to be that adult for her again.\n\nAnd please consider apologizing for the way you handled your frustration. It'll help your relationship as well as teach her what humility and integrity looks like.", "YTA\n\nDoes mom have a boyfriend or male friends over or does mom seem to be on any substances?

He needs to figure out which it is.", "Not if the kid doesn't want to see the parent at all.  Unless there is some major issue going on, the court will enforce at least the minimum visitation.   And if OP doesn't force it, the ex could get full custody.  I've seen judges send deputies in to basically drag kids to visit parents.  A 14 year old in handcuffs is never a good time for anyone", "Came here to say this\nI forced my kids to see their dad until they said they no longer want a relationship and why. When I heard the why, I stopped forcing them and at their age, cops can\u2019t even enforce a custody order. \n\nOP, please listen to your daughter. Some  to hug is going on and I think you should now have a suspicion. Get her in therapy now. Now. \nAnd let her Mom take you back to court if she wants to see her daughter. \n\nGo get her. Now."]}
