Does her mom make her the baby sitter? Does mom push a lot of responsibility onto 14 yr old? Does she make a teen share a room with small kids? \n\nThere are a lot of valid reasons. I understand you wanting to make sure she has a relationship with her mom. But if her own mom wont make things comfortable for her own teen kid, then thats on mom.

That's not much, she could easily just take your daughter out on a trip 2x a month instead of having her stay in the house with her abusive step sibling.
