Even if we should be inclusive, Alix shouldn't have been allowed to choose music (which is loud by definition) if she was unable to listen to it. At the very least, she should have to bring her own noise canceller (un casque anti bruit ou des bouchons). \n\nBeing inclusive mean that Alix can take the same courses as long as the other students are not impacted by her needs, and teacher has to consider the whole class and not only the special need one.\n\nFor those who don't know, many students in France have problem getting in college/uni because it's an automatic system that choose your affectation (so you can basically be top of your class, one of the best of the country, and still not be accepted to your first choice because of the system (parcours sup). Depending of your {filiere}, music can count more than mathematics for your grades.", "hmmm NTA. if her needs are disrupting the overall class in learning and preparing for an exam, then she should be the one who needs to go out of her way to make sure shes not disrupting anyone else. being neurodivergent doesn\u2019t give you an excuse to disrupt others around you.", "As a physically disabled person, I long ago realised certain accommodations could NOt be made for me by friends and family.\nIt was just not physically possible in some situations.\nSo there were various activities I did not take part in so as to not restrict the enjoyment of others. \nEven subconsciously it will build resentment.\n\nThe student in this case has made a poor choice and is damaging the prospects of those around her. \n\nAccommodations for students with special needs should not be to detriment of those around them. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.

It just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Bands are incredibly LOUD and I don\u2019t know how they wouldn\u2019t know that.", "NTA as you've mentioned this has been a recurring issue for 4 months. I get why this is frustrating for you (and likely others) since its a bit part of your overall grade.\n\nThe teacher absolutely should have put something in place before now and I imagine the reason they haven't is because no fuss has been made. You're right to stand up for yourself and you were asked a direct question by Alix, which I can't blame you for answering honestly in the circumstances.", "NTA.\n\nThis is precisely why I think students with special needs this severe should not share classes with normal students. She is objectively holding all of you back. You definitely could have worded that less harshly or even better spoken to someone about this issue before this but overall you are right.", "NTA. I just don\u2019t understand why schools do this. Someone with her issues has no business being in a class like this. They are bending over backwards to help one student at the expense of the other students.

Why did Alix picked this class if it\u2019s so unbearable to listen music?", "NTA having reasonable accommodations put in place for you should not mean that other students suffer because of it. \n\nIt might be harsh but you were quite correct in stating the if she is unable to listen to the important music why the hell did she take it!", "You're NTA. It is not right for the needs of one person to drag down the entire class. Sounds like Alix needs a mew major, or some noise reducing headphones. She also baited you with her manipulative question. It's not your fault she did not like the honest answer.", "Everyone sucks here. I understand your frustration, but you handled it very poorly. A better response would have been to talk with the teacher outside of class to find a different method of studying.

It\u2019s unfair to everyone, including Alix. \n\nAlix herself should be making plans with her teacher to find a way to studying that doesn\u2019t effect everyone around her.

Teachers should make accommodations to support disabled students, but not make such drastic changes to the structure of the curriculum that it disadvantages other students.\n\nNot aware of the disability legislation in France but it sounds like Alix needs some kind of support plan, with input from professionals, to find solutions to these problems. If she has such a plan in place already then the school is failing her. It sounds like the sensitivity to noise is an ongoing need and there's no way she chose that class with her or her teachers thinking there would never be music played out loud.\n\nEar defenders exist and hugely dampen down the noise you can hear when wearing them, even more so than the earbuds others have been suggesting. I used to work with kids with special needs and plenty of our kids used ear defenders.\n\nHowever YTA a bit for your words to Alix, as your response was really directed at the wrong person. It's not Alix who decides how a class is run. Your teachers are to blame for deciding not to play the music you need to study. If you're not happy you need to speak to your teacher, their head of department or someone senior at the school, like the special needs coordinator (or French equivalent).", "I don't think you're an arsehole, but I don't think standing in a classroom & berating a teacher & student is appropriate.

She has good taste in bands/genres but simply cannot listen to them at a \"loud\" level... This is only a sound problem, if it was quiet she would be with us and there's be no disrupting.", "The teacher didn't have much choice either. If she asked the ASD student to step out she could have been reported for not catering for her choices. The ASD student should be the one asking to study at home.", "It sounds like an administrative failure to me, and as though the teacher is inexperienced/not coping. I wonder what kind of needs assessment was done to evaluate what reasonable accommodations could be put in place for this student in this class?", "The situation was about her and she wanted to have the last word, but I wasn't paying attention to her.

This situation has been going on for 4 months this year, but also last school year (2021-2022) which is why we are all exceeded. \n\nI understand I was wrong with how I brought it up, but I think my opinions were at least valid?

It was OK to make accommodations to Alix in the beginning until she found a solution for everyone but now it's a problem!\nWhat I'm complaining about is not only having to listen to it later, but not having the teacher's comments on the piece itself. This impacts all students, even Alix! Therefore we all are missing infos about the piece such as \"what did the composer want us to feel by putting X instrument at X time\" etc. It also prevents us from doing tests in class (comparing 2 pieces, analysing them, both with teacher's review which is a must considering it is what the exam will consist in)\nI realise I f-ed up when talking to Alix and already apologised to her, but she didn't really forgive me (I understand now, and it's normal) but I don't feel bad for the teacher.", "You need to report your grievances to the school office.", "She needs to use ear loops.

I do think your opinions are incredibly valid. I would feel the same. Thank you for expanding on the situation. Given that you did approach the teacher previously to sort manner, I don\u2019t think you suck nearly as much as everyone else. Your words were still a little cruel, and you could have refrained from questioning her love of music/insulting her mental abilities, but unfortunately the truth hurts and I think it\u2019s important for both your teacher and Alix to hear the truth of the matter. You\u2019re young, no one should expect you to be completely civil in a situation where you are being disadvantaged. I think it would be best for you to bring this to your parents and the head of the school, since your teacher\u2014in doing nothing\u2014is actively sabotaging your future.", "She tried earbuds, but she then panicked because she couldn't hear the teacher. I think they were just regular airpods (unbranded ones), because her single mom couldn't afford noise reducers...", "I said it in another comment, but she panicked while wearing airpods because she couldn't hear the teacher.
