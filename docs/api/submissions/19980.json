Your little sister is 14, she hasn\u2019t finished growing yet so there\u2019s that, but she\u2019s also already struggling with her weight and her receiving advice from anyone who isn\u2019t a medical professional who knows her habits and thoughts around food and her body well enough isn\u2019t a good thing.\n\nThe only advice I could possibly give in this situation is sit down and talk to your sister, don\u2019t push her to make any decisions but that if she needs help reaching out to someone who can properly help her without also hurting her self image (bc that happens no matter how good your intentions are).", "I can\u2019t / won\u2019t give judgement.

Your parents are the ones who need to help her, since their poor parenting choices have led her into this position.

Unfortunately, in a home environment where her own parents are not being supportive, it will be very difficult.  Your parents are not doing her any favours.\n\nDon't give up.  Convincing her not to starve herself was an \\*excellent\\* thing to do!  But if you are to be able to help, you need to be very gentle about it.  See if you can find online resources where she can read about sensible eating habits, and perhaps find kinds of exercise that are fairly gentle which she can do with you\u2014walking is an excellent one, and you can walk \\*to\\* something, or to do something (eg take photos or, er, search for Pokemon?) so it has a purpose other than exercise.  Maybe get some very light hand weights and offer to show her good techniques for exercises (which she can then do, or not do, in the privacy of her own room).  It is her choice to do these things or not, but do be sympathetic to the fact that it is a lot easier for her, right now, to stay as she is, than to make the considerable effort needed to change things.  She doesn't like her weight as she is, but what she wants is for it to have changed.  (Ask me how I know.)  Wanting to make it change is a lot harder, so please keep sympathetic and don't give up on her.  You seem to be the only helpful person in the household.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Does she just want tips and encouragement or does she expect you to be some sort of drill sergeant? Then compare her expectations with what you're willing to offer. Discuss where things have gone to pot previously and how the two of you can avoid those pitfalls this time round. \n\nSetting minimal expectations, (like 2 healthy meals and acceptable, convenient snacks, along with 3 visits to the gym per week and gentle exercise on the other 4 days) & fitness goals rather than weight-loss goals, might help her feel like her whole life isn't morphing into constant, obsessive misery.\n\nFor your part, you can encourage her to stick to the agreed upon plan/ help facilitate her trips to the gym/ suggest filling top-ups when she's hungry/ bored, without appearing to judge her when she wavers from the plan. \n\nWhat you're trying to do for your sister is admirable and you don't deserve to get shit for it from your parents. Just remember that your sister allowing you to help her, puts the added pressure on her that if she fails, she won't just be disappointed in herself, but you might be disappointed too. I suspect that's where some of her irrational reactions from her are stemming from.", "I don't think that you are the a. I think you want the best for her but it is also very difficult and painful for her. I really don't like when people you the term or in general diets , i think that often it's considered to starve oneself etc. Since you say your mum is overweight and your dad has diabetes, it sounds like it's also an issue in the family. I think best would be to see where you can exchange healthier food options with unhealthy ones, if that's the case. But it's difficult if you try to help your sister, if your parents eat/live unhealthy if this is the case? \nMaybe try to be there for her and maybe find an activity you both enjoy doing together like walking/hiking, going swimming, or maybe riding the bike, playing tennis or batminton or yeah going to the gym. You could also just try out different things together. Overall try to be there for her because she already as you said gets negative impact from school and her home and doesn't really seem to have a safe space.", "I agree with the person who said just go walks with her. You don\u2019t need to work out hard before you achieve any benefit. If you can get her to do this two or three times a week, it will help her feel better physically and emotionally.

She did ask you to help, and you're trying very hard to help her. It's very hard to get started on that weight loss track, and it takes most people a few tries to get into a solid routine and turn it into a lifestyle. So don't feel like you're failing by not getting her on board btw. But honestly, the second someone snaps at you and says you're calling them fat, I would just drop and say well, it's your problem now, if you want to come to the gym with me let me know but you're on your own.

She\u2019s not your bro, she\u2019s a baby, so baby the situation. NTA the parents are. Lead with love, be more loving! If you can help her successfully, she will never forget it. Write that letter and envelope fold it. Youtube has a video for the envelope fold, I\u2019m sure. Get stickers. Text affirmations as well!

In fact, you're likely making things far, far worse because you have no experience or understanding of how to approach this in a way that doesn't upset her and cause her distress - as evidenced by her response to you. If you really want to help, leave her alone. Seriously. If you're distressed by her weight gain, talk to your parents about what THEY'RE doing to help, about ensuring that she is seeing her doctor, maybe a therapist.

It might be a doctor issue instead.  \n\nSince she's a teen, mental health is also an issue.  \n\nI think you just need more tact in offering help.  Don't push.

She obviously doesn't want help and you can't help someone that doesn't want help. Maybe she got fat as a cooping mechanism, if you feel like it try to talk to her about how she feels if you can do it the right way.

She may have never learned healthy habits and so doesn't know how to diet safely. It seems like this is a problem that your parents have created and you are trying to fix but the way you like to keep healthy is not going to work for your sister. \n\nCan the two of you learn to cook some healthy snacks/meals together? Food she likes so it is available when she is hungry and she doesn't default to junk food. Maybe try to apologise to her for the way you went about it before and see if there is a way that you both can work on this together.\n\nIt doesn't sound like the gym is for her, she may be more comfortable with ddr or dancing or something that the goal isn't exercise but having fun. Also suggest walking places instead of driving if that is safe where you live. Try to find active things to do that the purpose isn't exercise it, if my brother asked if I wanted to go to the gym I'd say no but I'd happily go for a walk with him.\n\nYou seem like a fantastic brother, 14 is a difficult age especially when dealing with a sensitive topic.

As someone that has always found just straight up working out boring and uncomfortable, especially at the gym, something I would suggest that may help is showing her ways that physical activity can be better than just going to the gym. Maybe try a more subtle approach, like inviting your sister for fun weekend activities that involve getting at least a little bit active without (and this is the important part) indicating that you\u2019re doing it for any other reason than to just spend quality sibling time together. My suggestions: walking around the mall, walk in the park, boating maybe, or if your sister is a huge nerd like myself you could even try larping or pok\u00e9mon go. Just show her ways to have fun besides sitting on the couch that she can incorporate into her life on her own. Everything else is up to her.

Ask her to go on a walk together, play something like a bit of basketball or football together, even bloody catch. Just something that is moving.\n\nThen for the diet, get cooking together. Do meal prep together. Try new foods together. Speak with your parents about reducing the snacks and sugary drinks bought so they're not there in the first place. She's 14 so surely being served at least one meal a day - make that meal a healthy balanced - and tasty one - without mentioning diet.\n\nSometimes with teens they can't accept the help or feel embarrassed, or like they're being bossed about...

That's a really, really unhealthy weight for her age and your parents suck for not teaching her healthy habits from an early age. Like she is shorter than me and 110lbs heavier than me and I'm thirty and have had two kids, a chronic health conditions... And she's under half my age.

Supporting her in any health-positive activities she chooses to do, and inviting her freely to join yours (without judgement if she declines) are absolutely things you should keep doing!\n\nOne thing a lot of people don't realise - even those with the issue - is that health, weight, and food-related problems are often much more about what's going on inside our heads than inside our bodies. While the physical impacts on our bodies are easier to see, the first work takes place in our thoughts and feelings. After all, if the negative health impacts were enough to motivate us to change, we'd already be changing things.\n\nIt's not your job to help her understand those parts of herself or find her a path to happiness and health. What you can do is listen out for if she expresses the mental/emotional difficulty she has around changes that she wants to make (or wants to want to make) and show that you are listening and believe her. You can recognise that lifestyle changes involve our thoughts and feelings, not just our behaviours. You can refuse to engage with people who say things along the lines of 'you just need more willpower'. And you can continue to love her openly and honestly regardless of her body or her health.", "She most likely needs some therapy, and is using food as comfort.", "Just, for the love of all things holy, keep her away from any bullshit like, Fat Activists, HAES (Health At Every Size) and mindful eating followed by only obese or morbidly obese women. She'll never get better if she falls into that hole.", "That's how changing ingrained habits works - you try and quit and try and quit and try and quit and then at some point some changes start to stick. Maybe it will be less frustrating if you think of the trying part as the success, and the quitting part as her taking the break she needs before trying again? Otherwise it can very easily become a vicious circle for her of feeling defeated and insufficient every time she 'fails', which will demotivate her more and more in the long run. You can focus on congratulating her for having done something, because something is a lot more than nothing regardless of whether there are breaks inbetween.\n\nJust think of how much 'failure' is needed to learn to play an instrument, or become good at a sport. Learning a skill is pretty much 100% sucking at it until someday you don't. (It's also giving up on it regularly and then picking it back up when you've gotten over yourself, I speak from experience with something I do professionally now.) Changing your whole lifestyle is the same as learning any other skill, except harder.", "ah.  well don't show your frustration... it's a roller coaster ride and she must be just as frustrated if not more for her.\n\nSee if her parents will let her go to the doctor to check hormones or what not and see if there's anything on that end.\n\nAt some point if this were me, I would probably be open with her about your struggles with weight and talk about how you don't want to turn out like dad and that you want her to be with you healthy for a long time.    \n\n\nI would also invite with a \"I enjoy your company, let's do things together\" type of deal.  \n\n\nYou can also offer to cook with her health meals and enjoy them together.  Sorry you have to parent.", "A new book came out recently called \"You Can't Screw This Up\" by Adam Bornstein. I'm reading it right now.

That's great advice though", "Right now it probably seems to her that you're piling on the shit. Hence the go for a walk, use your environment, lets go there, where there's a lot of walking, zoos work. Ask if she wants to try rock climbing. Don't make it about the weight, make it about spending time with her.", "Yeah that's super logical and I don't know why I didn't think about this. This is what I do with my kids. I had an ED when I was younger and a mum obsessed with diet culture and it messed with my head so bad. Healthy foods and an active lifestyle with lots of hikes and time in nature has been amazing for my own family dynamic.\n\nI definitely agree the focus on weight is not the way to go. I know as someone with an ED previously that it will just exacerbate the problem but it must be so hard as a sibling when the parents don't give a shit."]}
