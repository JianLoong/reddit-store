I have two kids (17m /19f). and their half brother is 3 years old.\n\n\n\nthis past week. My husband had an emergency (dad had a medical emergency) and wanted someone to watch our son. he asked my older son and he refused because he was going out with friends. he also asked my daughter but she locked herself in her room to study. I was at the restaurant with my brother meeting his girlfriend for the first time. My husband ended up taking our son with him to the hospital and his mom watched him from there.\n\n\nHe came home and was lashing out on everybody. Calling us selfish and unfeeling. I tried to explain that the kids were busy but he told me to get the f out with that bull because my older son could've skipped the hangout and watched his brother and, my daughter could've watched her brother while studying instead of locking herself in her room. He scolded me as well but I told him I couldn't leave lunch with my brother since he was visiting town and this was my only chance to meet his girlfriend.\n\nHe yelled some more than told us that he was canceling the family holiday trip for christmas this year. The two older kids were upset and said it was unfair. I called him unreasonable to cancel the trip and punish the kids (and possibly me) like that. he refused to discuss it later. Now me and the kids aren't speaking to him and he's saying \"good riddance\"\n\n\n*edit My husband was supposed to watch our son at the time. That's why I went to see my brother at the restaurant. The kids aren't used to watching their brother when neither parent is home.*\n\n\n*update My husband just told us that he'll be spending christmas with his family saying he needs to be around his dad anyway. the kids said they will just go to their dad since they and my husband are still not talking. neither of the kids are happy with how things turned out. so I feel like things have gotten out of hand and the problem got bigger. He's now choosing to basically abandon us on christmas and also keep our son away from me and his siblings.*", "created_utc": 1670075773, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbguxp/aita_for_calling_my_husband_unreasonable_for/", "score": 21484, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What don't you all get about an emergency?! That generally means people might have to drop what they're doing plans wise to help out. He was abandoned at a time of need and has every single right to be pissed and cancel the trip.", "YTA, and so are your kids. I don\u2019t blame your husband for being upset. He had a family emergency and everyone in his household basically told him to pound sand and you refused to take care of your child, and your children refused to take care of their sibling, in an emergency? Sorry you are awful and raised awful children, and sorry you can\u2019t see his perspective on this. You have no empathy.", "YTA. My definition of family is one where people are there for one another. And the step relationship is sometimes hard enough to manage on a good day. You all completely abandoned him in his time of need. Tbh, you are the most guilty. It\u2019s presumably your child? And even if it isn\u2019t, you prioritized dinner over not only helping your husband, but picking up the slack for your small child to not have to be in a tense hospital environment, for being responsible for your MIL having to care for a small child when her husband had some sort of issue, but also, just being there to emotionally support your husband through what was most likely a very scary time. \n\nAnd instead of realizing how you all massively failed him, you\u2019re calling him unreasonable. Which is doubling down on your initial failure to begin with.\n\nYou all have made it perfectly clear that you\u2019re not a true family in terms of being there for one another in times of need. I\u2019d be concerned that this fractured the marriage permanently. If you were married to me, my takeaway is that my **life partner** cares too much about a dinner than to be there for me. And I would honestly leave you for it. This would legit be the hill I\u2019d die on. Because it shows you at your very base level, who you are, and what type of partner you are. And instead of fucking up and then profusely apologizing, *you\u2019re* calling *him* unreasonable. That he\u2019s not taking you and your selfish children on holiday. This legit blows my mind and is textbook insult to injury. \n\nAnd you\u2019re here upset over a holiday coming on Reddit to \u2018see if you\u2019re wrong\u2019. It\u2019s not a good look, btw.", "Nice to know that in the face of an emergency, you'd choose *check notes* meeting your brother's girlfriend over your youngest son's well-being. \n\nYTA.

Why couldn't you go \"Hey, my FIL is have a medical emergency, do you mind if my kiddo join?\u201c\n\nThe idea that not one of you people stepped up for your husband is mind blowing. His father is in the hospital and your husband is scared and worried....

And frankly, the biggest asshole is YOU.   Your son could have volunteered to step up to be nice but he was under no obligation.  Your daughter \\*had to study\\*.  Studying trumps mommy meeting her brother's girlfriend (?!?!?!?!) and your Father in Law being emergently ill and in the hospital HUGELY trumps meeting the girlfriend.   \n\n\nYou should have immediately left and gone to support your husband by tending to your mutual child.    \n\n\nThis is not how grown adults behave.

You could have asked your husband if he could drop him off at the restaurant on his way to the hospital.", "Why should the guy do anything for you guys if you won't give a hand when he is in a dire situation? I mean I get why he is reacting like that.\n\nHonestly you could have said something to your brother, suggesting that he and his gf came back home with you so that you could enjoy time with them while taking care of your kid.

Good riddance is the proper  expression here.", "YTA and your kids are AHs.

And not only that you let your baby visit a hospital in the middle of a Covid/flu/RSV surge.", "YTA, everything that you were doing was not nearly as important as an emergency. Clearly your priorities are misguided.", "Yta his dad was in the hospital, you could have left lunch and your brother and his girlfriend could have come to your house to visit.

It\u2019s obvious where your kids get their personality from and it\u2019s nothing to be proud of. All of you were selfish and unempathetic, IT WAS AN EMERGENCY.

You aren't concerned that your teen children chose not to be inconvenienced for a family medical emergency?", "did you suddenly not become the baby's mother while you were lunching with your brother?", "YTA I'm surprised he's not divorcing you.", "YTA and so are your older children for not stepping up in an emergency. He deserves better.", "YTA\n\nYou all COULD help during the emergency. You all CHOSE NOT TO (its called stepping up if it is something the kids haven't done before. They know how to learn, dont they?)\n\nYou sound like a bad parent who passed on your horrible traits to your kids\n\n*Response to your update: You and your kids still dont understand/see how selfish and apathetic you three are. He has every right not to speak with you all. You and your kids show NO remorse or empathy and are now being brats for acting like entitled sociopaths when you dont deserve the vacation. The family was abandoned when the three of you left him hanging.*", "YTA - A family medical emergency is top priority, always. You didn't even need to cancel your plans. You could have told your brother \"Hey, we have a family emergency, but I want to spend time with you and your new GF, can we move this lunch to my house so I can send it with you and my son who I need be with\". And even if you did need to cancel, how does meeting your brothers new GF is a higher priority than what your husband was going through?\n\nYour son is an AH - He could have skipped lunch with friends, or ask to do TakeOut and move the lunch to your house. But nope.\n\nYour daughter is an AH - What a horrible excuse for a daughter. She was literally IN THE HOUSE! How is studying ever more important than a health emergency in the family? It is one afternoon/evening. No degree is so important. No test. Ever.\n\nThe cherry on the cake is that YOU and the kids are refusing to talk to HIM because of the trip. You three are so self centered it is crazy. \n\nI am so sorry for your husband that needed to go through what he did with such an unsupportive family. He must be completely devastated. He was 100% in the right for telling you guys off and canceling the vacation. Why would he want to spend a vacation with you? He would 100% be in the right to stop a marriage over something like this.\n\nPoor guy.", "YTA - you did all behave totally selfishly.", "Just to add, the 3yo is your son too.

You just showed your husband you don\u2019t care about him or his family.", "YTA!\n\nNONE of you could drop what you're doing to watch the kid while his dad is in the hospital fighting for his life? You all deserve to be left!", "YTA - you could have picked YOUR kid up and went back to hang with your brother.  He wasn\u2019t asking you to cancel that.

For only he and the only non-AH child. Leaving the rest of you home.", "YTA, and your teenagers are too. His father was I the fucking hospital and not one of the three of you had anything more important than that going on.", "YTA - Let's get this straight, rather than leave your precious lunch date you a) refused to help your husband when he was frightened for and worried about his father and b) left your inlaws in the position of having to care for your son while they were worried about their father, talking to doctors etc and 3) Possibly exposed your son to a frightening experience, hospitals can be very frightening to toddlers and seeing his dad's family upset won't have been great for him either.\n\nFamilies help one another when emergencies happen, why didn't you just go and collect your son and take him to the restaurant? I'm sure your brother and girlfriend would have understood, it's not like your FIL did it on purpose. I don't even need to touch on the older kids because it's obvious where they took their attitudes from.\n\nIt's amusing though that after you and your older children put yourselves first - which fair enough you were entitled to do - you're now getting upset because prioritising yourselves had negative consequences for you. Tough.  I would imagine your husband doesn't want to be near any of you right now.", "Omg YTA. Wtf. I can\u2019t believe you even had to ask.", "YTA. It sounds like no one in your family actually loves or cares for this man. If any of you did, you would reschedule and inconvenience yourselves to support him while he and his family is in crisis. Wouldn\u2019t his family also be your family if you are married??? I would absolutely cancel a family trip. What family??", "YTA. The three of you are massive AH's actually. This was an emergency. Other plans should have been altered or cut. Ultimately, this one lands on you though because this is your son. You were being absolutey irresponsible by not leaving some ridiculous lunch to go take care of him. It sounds like you are not going to have a husband much longer anyway given your selfish behavior in this.", "YTA.\n\nHe isn\u2019t canceling the trip because you all couldn\u2019t help him.

You personally might get a slight pass because of your brother was from out of town and you probably don't get to see each other often, but even you could have just taken your brother and his girlfriend back to your place ordering take-out while looking after your son.\n\nI wouldn't want to go on a holiday vacation with a \"family\" who didn't have my back in an emergency either.", "YTA your older kids are inconsiderate, but you take the main guilt. I assume your son is more important than your brother's girlfriend. You could easily excuse yourself and say you had a family emergency and rushed to take care of YOUR son. It really surprises me that you have old kids and don't know how to act in situations like this. I'm 100% with your husband. Way to see how nobody of his family had his back during a stressful moment.", "YTA. Any single one of you could, and should have dropped what you were doing. You were all selfish. Nothing any of you were doing was life and death, meanwhile what your husband was dealing with could have been. You all suck. That poor man has no support from his own damn family", "YTA.  He just realized how selfish you and your children are and he isn't willing to give them an expensive experience when he recently learned of their character.  I didn't hear a reasonable excuse from you or your kids why they couldn't change plans to watch someone's kid for a family medical emergency.  I wouldn't want to take you all on a vacation either.", "Your husband should go on the trip by himself this year. YTA", "YTA. You need to apologize to him, talk to your kids and explain every piece of feedback on this post, AND make it up to him without expecting anything in return.

If you still want this marriage that is.", "YTA, you couldn't watch your own kid because you're at lunch but expect your husband to do it when he's having a medical emergency and needs to go to the hospital?

It was more important to meet your brother\u2019s girlfriend than to help out in a genuine emergency. What if it was the other way around and your husband prioritised meeting a stranger for the first time over helping out when you were having a crisis", "YTA. How do you not see that? You start the post by telling us it was a medical emergency for his dad! So he was stressed, upset and then frustrated that absolutely nobody in his family would help him out in said emergency. None of you had things you couldn't change. His punishment is a tough one, but he has lashed out for aforementioned reasons, and frankly I don't blame him.", "YTA. Medical emergencies trump hang ups, studying and meeting girlfriends.", "YTA. Wow. You and your kids really showed your colors. A medical situation is an emergency, and not one person could be bothered to watch your child? Not one person could be bothered to check on your husband in the hospital? You people need to develop some empathy. Prioritizing dinner, friend, and studying over your husband and young child in an emergency is vile.\n\n*Edited: The son is your child too. The way you write here makes it sound like he's a stepkid and you're the evil stepmother. But you're his actual mother. Wow.", "YTA. He is YOUR husband and YOUR three year old child. As wife and mother you should have stepped in. Your brother and his gf could have come visit you at your house. If I were your husband I\u2019d be preparing to be your ex-husband.", "Yikes...YTA (you, your son and your daughter).   And I don't blame him for canceling the trip. Seems to me you 3 are very self-centered.\n\nAlso, isn't this your son as well? Sorry, but I think you could have easily picked up YOUR kid for lunch and / or invited your brother and his girlfriend back to your place to watch him.  \n\nThe same goes to your son and daughter. Your son could have canceled hanging out with his friends for one day,  and your daughter was home and could have easily watched him.\n\nYou 3 made things more difficult and stressful for your husband and not only that, were you not even concerned for your FIL?", "YTA. Why on earth would you expect him to reward you with a trip when not one of you could be bothered to simply watch another member of your family during an emergency? All three of you are incredibly selfish and self centered. I truly feel bad for your husband", "Yes, you\u2019re not only an AH but you and your children come off as entitled. It\u2019s honestly sad that you have to ask this question. Your son definitely could have canceled with his friends to step up during a medical emergency. Your daughter definitely could have studied and watched her brother during the medical emergency. You definitely could have either rescheduled or brought your son with you to see your brother and girlfriend. You act like your husband asked for you all to help a stranger, its your son/their sibling. There\u2019s no reason your husband had to worry about watching a kid while also making sure his father was okay. What is the purpose of having a life partner if they wont step in and help/assist when needed. How would you feel if it was your mother/father going through a medical emergency and you have your youngest and he told you no because him and the guys planned on going to a game in 15 minutes? It seems like he\u2019s raising 3 teens and a toddler.\n\nEdit: Before i forget, if anyone should have dropped anything though; YOU should have been first as the mother.", "YTA - In most situations, it is not fair to ask kids to watch their younger sibling. But this was an emergency. It wasn't planned and required a hospital visit. But all of you were to... checks notes... busy. He didn't ask them to miss an important event, he just asked one to stay home and one not to lock herself in her room. I was raised that in case of an emergency, you help out. It was a one-time thing for a few hours. \n\nTheir selfishness forced him to take a 3-year-old to a hospital. Do you know what kind of germs and things he could be exposed to at a hospital? Fun fact, my mother got MRSA just from visiting a hospital and it caused her lifelong issues.\n\nOf course, he was mad. And you dare to be frustrated about it? Way to focus on the sparkly holiday trip instead of someone's health. Question - why didn't YOU as the other parent help him out?", "Here are a few scenarios.\n\n* \"Hey, sorry, I really want to spend more time getting to meet your girlfriend, but my father-in-law has a medical emergency so I need to look after my son so that my husband can go to him.\"\n\n* \"Hey guys, sorry, I won't be able to hang out today, I need to look after my lil brother because his dad needs to go to HIS dad for a medical emergency.\"\n\n* \"Hey self, I need to spend a bit of time with my stepbrother because his dad's dad has a medical emergency.\"\n\nHow many of those sound unreasonable? Is it none of them?\n\nYTA. Way to make your husband think you don't care about him, his father, or your son. Please rethink your priorities.", "YTA- Sounds like you have entitled kids who have no empathy and complete lack of respect for their step dad. Of course they like his money though, i mean they are upset about missing the trip but couldn't watch their little brother for a bit.\n\nAnd you are an enabler, no wonder your kids turned out like this. I guess your husband now understands what he married into.", "YTA and you and your kids should start packing. He should throw you all out.", "YTA, and so are your kids. I'm glad your husband canceled the trip.", "YTA, that also applies to your older kids too.", "Exactly what I would do. Why kill yourself working and providing for a family who can't even  help out in an emergency.", "YTA and this is telling exactly where your relationship stands with your spouse. You're a selfish asshole and so are your children.", "YTA I wouldn\u2019t take you or your kids to the corner store after this. You and those \u201cchildren\u201d are beyond selfish", "Y T A. now his side of the family sees how reliable you guys are. Good job.", "YTA - It was an emergency and you didn\u2019t support him at all.

You\u2019re arguing that meeting your brother\u2019s girlfriend was more important than helping your husband while his father was in the hospital. Do you see how stupid that is? Invite them over for coffee at your place while you watch the kid. Your husband is valid in everything he\u2019s said and everything that he\u2019s feeling. You all failed to come together and help him by watching YOUR OWN SON. You are a selfish woman and you\u2019ve done a great job raising 2 kids to be just like you.", "So so much the AH sooooo much. Not only are you not getting your holiday which you are more worried about then your husband and youngest child but while all of you are giving him the silent treatment he\u2019s probably already talking to a divorce lawyer because you just proved that you are married to him only for money and the things he gives you and nothing else.  You\u2019ve also set your oldest kids up to fail in life if they zero compassion towards your husband and his family.", "YTA.   Your husband was trying to cope with an emergency. - he needed some help with YOUR son so that he could deal with that emergency better and you all fucked him off just so you could all do things that really would have held off for a while.

God forbid any of you take any sort of action to help him when there is a medical emergency. Really show\u2019s priority to him. You\u2019d be lucky if he isn\u2019t looking for his way out now. Also good luck on any help from him. By the sounds of it he had paid or majority paid for this trip for him to be able to cancel it. Can\u2019t believe how selfish your family is.", "YTA and so are your son and daughter too. He asked for help but finds out that when he needs it you don't give a flying f about him. And I hope he strongly think about the relationship with you and consult with a lawyer.\n\nYou should take your kids and yourself to therapy. You three really needs it.", "YTA. Y'all showed him right before the holidays that none of you care for him at all. Why would he want to go on vacation with your entitled self and children?", "YTA. Your FIL was at the hospital. What is wrong with you and your kids?", "YTA. \n\nHis dad was hospitalized and out of 3 capable people, you being one of them, NO ONE could watch the 3 yr old? That\u2019s ludicrous. Maybe dad and the 3 yr old need to spend the holiday with his parents while you and the older kids figure out your own holiday trip.", "YTA. His dad had a medical emergency and none of you could leave your mundane, everyday ass activities to help out? It\u2019s not that you and your kids *couldn\u2019t* help, you just *wouldn\u2019t.* Your husband has just learned that he cannot depend on his family even in an emergency and that he\u2019s dead last on all of your lists of priorities.\n\nYour children and husband come before everybody and everything else. If you weren\u2019t prepared to make sacrifices for your family then you shouldn\u2019t have had one.\n\nETA: ABSOLUTELY RICH of you to complain that your husband is \u201cabandoning you\u201d as if that\u2019s not exactly what the fuck you did to him.

You all aren\u2019t family and don\u2019t deserve a vacation. All 3 of you could\u2019ve dropped what you were doing to help.", "A medical emergency and none of you could be bothered.   100% TA.  Why would he want to spend time with you all if you all can't spare him the time of day in an EMERGENCY?", "YTA as are your two kids.", "YTA. You typed this out thinking we\u2019d agree with you but sadly i think you\u2019re alone. It was a medical emergency, how are you and everyone around you so selfish? I would\u2019ve done more than cancel the trip.", "Congratulations on raising 2 kids who are exactly like you. Selfish. \n\nIt was a medical emergency. \n\nI divorced my husband over a medical emergency when he left me hanging. \n\nEnjoy your single life.\n\nYTA", "YTA. And the elder son and daughter. You all callously abandoned him to deal with a medical emergency alone in favour of *leisure activities* (apart from the studying but still, emergencies are valid reason to drop everything and handle the situation). You really think hanging out at a hospital during an emergency was the best situation for a 3 year old while you relax socially, washing your hands of it all?! Husband has every right to be outraged and hurt and disappointed in you all and if I was him I would not exactly be wanting to hang out on holiday such a selfish lot calling themselves \u201cfamily\u201d. You deserve your punishment, take it.", "YTA", "YTA good for him", "He had a family emergency and needed help. It wasn't that he wanted to go out last minute with buddies, he needed help and when he asked for it y'all refused.

Meeting your brothers girlfriend was not a priority at that point and either of your grown up kids could have watched the 3 year old. Prepare for lots of resentment that will ultimately end your marriage. Either that or you could all see how you were in the wrong, get your heads out your arses and apologise to your poor husband. I mean with family like you who needs enemies right. Awful people.", "YTA. I honestly hope you have a good divorce lawyer because I would leave someone who couldn't help in an actual emergency.", "YTA. \n\nCould you and your children be any more selfish and uncaring? Your husband\u2019s father was having a medical emergency and not one of the three of you could pull yourself away from your non-important activities to help him out? \n\nYour husband may be going a little too far by canceling your Christmas trip, but honestly, who can blame him for not wanting to go away with the three of you who so obviously don\u2019t give a shit about him.", "YTA -  You especially, your husband needed help and you refused.  You, and your kids, are lacking in empathy. Get help.", "Do none of you like him or something? Tf kind of question is this", "Wow you and your kids are major assholes.\n\nGood riddance is right.", "YTA and so are your children.

Fuck, I feel bad for the husband.", "YTA - you refused to watch YOUR own child so your husband can go to the hospital so you could see your brothers girlfriend??\n\nWow! Goes to show where your older children got their selfish attitudes. Don\u2019t be surprised if your current husband divorces you!\n\nYour edit doesn\u2019t change anything, actually makes it worse since it shows you don\u2019t view him as an equal, but apparently as a babysitter who tried to cancel on you", "YTA.  Wow.  Just wow. I can\u2019t even imagine the hurt on top of hurt this man endured \u2026 parent in hospital..and his own entire household family doesn\u2019t give a damn.

What could've been a 5 second conversation with your brother like; \"I'm really sorry brother I have to go my husband has a family emergency. I'll call you later to catch back up on this.\" Literally. You showed your husband he wasn't important, your older son showed his friends were more important.

It's not impossible that he doesn't grasp the situation properly/being a teenager but feels unlikely when you add OP's behavior to the mix.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only one in the bunch that had a good reason was the daughter. That shit affects her present and future. Especially if there is an exam coming. That's the only point where OP's logic isn't complete bullocks. I don't blame the husband 1 bit.", "Yeah. My dad went into a coma in 2009 or whatever. Suddenly I\u2019m home for the winter break (he was hospitalized on the 22nd, went into a coma during our visit on the 24th) watching my much younger brother so mom could stay at the hospital. I\u2019m 22, it\u2019s Christmas, I have a boyfriend I wanted to see, my roommates would be shafted with late rent. \n\nRoommates were immediately and totally good and I had no issues. \n\nNone of our mutual friends in World of Warcraft though saw my boyfriend not taking it seriously as a legitimate issue. He just played and never once called. He also blocked me as habit in game if he was in a raid or dungeon so he wouldn\u2019t be distracted if I didn\u2019t see logging in yet. \n\nEveryone was shocked I dumped him. Everyone was shocked I expected emotional support from him. Or at least to not throw me on ignore in game too, the only place I could talk to him. I needed my ex. And he was indifferent. \n\nAnd I even played the goddamn game too. I would\u2019ve gotten and stayed in vent after raid to get some time. I\u2019d have taken scraps. But that was too much too.", "Maybe he decided that paying for a divorce takes precedence over taking these unfeeling people on a vacation.\n\nAdded: YTA, and your older kids, too.", "My brother phoned me up when we were still in contact a few years ago and said he needed me to watch the kids (at the time a 9m and twin 7f) because he had phoned for an ambulance because his wife had trouble feeling anything below the waist. I was in the next city over meeting a friend. I threw some cash on the table for my share told my friend \"family emergency\" ran back to the car and probably broke every speed limit out there (dumb in hindsight couldn't get there if I was being chased by police) and got there just in time for the ambulance to take my brother and SIL to the hospital without having to worry about the kids. Kept them entertained for a few hours and then got a phone call saying she was going to have to stay in overnight and he would be back in a few hours. I told him I would take the kids back to my place for the time being to get them fed as I had no clue what was where in there place and bring them back and pick him up later if he needed a lift. Thankfully it all worked out okay and she was fine afterwards but yeah you drop everything in a situation like that. YTA OP. Feel sorry for your husband for having to deal with your uncaring assholeness.", "I'm not sure I'd call her weird but certainly self-absorbed, selfish and uncaring.", "She could have easily invited her brother and his girlfriend back to their house. I mean, wtf, OP?", "You are a good friend!", "Can you imagine those kids \u201caren\u2019t speaking\u201d to her husband because it\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d that they don\u2019t get a reward for their shitty behavior!! Holy shit my kids would be lucky if the ever saw another gift ever with that crap ass attitude!! These people are all back-asswards!", "He cancelled the trip to pay the divorce lawyer \ud83d\ude09", "Me too. And can you imagine if this guy is the main, or a greater, breadwinner in the house? That would mean he is contributing to the support of these ingrate children.", "Poor kid is going to grow up with all the responsibilities the other kids don\u2019t have.", "I likey wikey how you think.", "I really hope so.", "The only reason I could see it being \"the only time\" aside from what others have said is if they lived far away and traveling was an expense they couldn't afford often.\n\nThat said, hospital-level family emergency trumps that lunch date.", "And that still doesn\u2019t explained why she couldn\u2019t take her own child. Yes it would be more difficult but not as difficult as husband juggling a 3 year at the freaking hospital.", "100% there isn't a soul in the world who would get upset about you leaving for an emergency!", "In her family that would have been scandalously inconvenient", "I wanted to say that.", "Unless they aren't decent human beings.", "Seriously. The kids are also the brother\u2019s niece/nephew so why not have a family event/meeting at the house?", "My youngest brother is 12 years my junior. When I was 24, my uncle died unexpectedly. My parents wanted to go help my aunt with everything but she was out of state so I went and stayed at my parents house for 3 days with my then 12 year old brother. I took off work and we had a Lord of the Rings extended edition marathon, which took a lot of the time up lol. I was more than happy to help and actually was excited to spend time with my brother. We are a close family and help each other, even as adults. I can't imagine being so incredibly blas\u00e9 about a family emergency and not helping out for just an hour! This is such a weird and selfish family dynamic.", "OP  is simply awful. The oldest son is barely better but he learned it from watching her. Opinion on the daughter withheld for not enough info, but at least she has a colorable excuse. What a rotten, self-centered, uncaring family. YTA OP.\n\nDamn.\n\nEdit: missing from your edits OP is the part where you and your oldest two realized they were wrong, and you all apologized and promised to do better and not be so self-centered.", "I hate calling for divorce. But they showed just how little they cared about him.\nI think hes taking time to reflect on things, if he's overreacting. Then he'll figure out, he's not and he'll be out of there", "Or like, one of the kids watches sibling for an hour and then OP heads home early. Or any combination of the three of them watching the kid. \n\n\nBut in a profoundly selfish household like this, I bet each of them knew that if they helped then they'd be giving up their whole night. Giving up a whole night isn't even bad, but clearly no one else in the family would do it for them if they needed it. Selfishness breeding more selfishness.", "What makes this even worse is that OP is now claiming that the husband is \"abandoning\" them during Christmas when the reality is he is going to spend it with his sick father. (And, I'm sure this guy wouldnt have wanted to be on a trip while his dad is ill even if OP and their kids weren't so horrible to him.)\n\nOP and their kids sound incredibly selfish + self centered and it doesn't sound like any of them even care about this man.", "She already is.. look at her delusional update:\n\n\"He's now choosing to basically abandon us on christmas and also keep our son away from me and his siblings.\"\n\nMy eyes almost rolled out of my head reading that.", "It's because she isn't backing him up when they wouldn't help in an emergency. Also... if his dad's in the hospital he's probably upset. I'd lash out too if I felt unappreciated and unsupported.", "Possibly a case of step-dad not being allowed to do any parenting here.", "If i knew people like you i might actually try this whole \"friendship\" \n thing. Most of the people i meet dont care about anything past the end of their arm. You sound awesome!", "Totally agree. The three sound quite entitled. It\u2019s all about what they can get.", "But she had PLANS.  The husband was supposed to watch the son so it\u2019s the husband\u2019s problem to find adequate childcare if he has an emergency.  He could have easily called a neighbor, gone on care.com or just brought the kid to the emergency room with him.  Three year old should be responsible enough to sit quietly for hours and hours while shit is dealt with.\n\nI think the 3-year-old is the a-hole for being 3 and not watching himself.", "OP married for money \ud83d\udcb0 and now her husband sees her true colors. No nice Christmas vacay paid for by the husband now!", "Not having all the facts, but it\u2019s possible that the daughter had a huge exam/assignment due that made it impossible for her to take on childcare of a toddler, but the others had no reasonable excuse at all.", "Yeah I saw that update! She\u2019s super delusional. No self-awareness whatsoever. She\u2019s facing the consequences of her inactions and she has a surprise pikachu face about it? Omg\n\nAnd how can she not see, it was the other way around. She abandoned him and their son when they really needed her. She has no empathy. You would\u2019ve thought she would\u2019ve apologized by now, but nope. And she and her spoiled brat kids continue to give him the silent treatment. Unbelievable.\n\nAnd the \u201cproblem got bigger\u201d lol.. she really can\u2019t see who started this whole issue in the first place? She needs to look in the mirror", "At the age of 6 onwards I understood what a kidney was, why it was important, why my mum had a transplanted one in her tummy, the medications she was on, never to touch the medications and what medications she could not have in case of an emergency. It wasn\u2019t an expectation put onto me, it was information I sought out so I could take care of my best friend if something happened, my mum is my best friend. At the age of 13, I understood that my Nan was having seizures and so she wouldn\u2019t be alone in the ambulance and while waiting for my mum and grandad, I would go in the ambulance with them and provided basic info and medical history. \n\nI understand not everyone grows up with a good or close relationship with their parents and immediate family, but when a loved one is in the hospital you pull together and rally. Friends can wait, studying can be done in the living room etc. there are ways around it to accommodate the emergency.\n\nI don\u2019t think the husband is right to cancel the holiday, strictly speaking it isn\u2019t his children\u2019s responsibility to mind their sibling. But this wasn\u2019t an every day after school thing it\u2019s a one off. A conversation about emergency situations is probably in order, and a calm respectful conversation about how everyone is feeling when cooler heads prevail would help a lot I think.", "Bitchy witchy to get turdy wordy!", "You'd be surprised how many people probably would care if you let them. I have to confess, I wasn't very good at friends growing up (suspect I'm very on the spectrum somewhere) but this particular friend saw something she liked in me and even though she's as aggressively introvert as I am, latched onto me pretty strong. I have created more (and more solid) friendships for myself using her modelled behaviour as a 40-odd year old adult than I had in my teenage years.", "Yep. I could forgive the kids (even though they're old enough) for being selfish assholes, but not the wife. \nI would absolutely drop everything if my OH called and said his family member is in hospital and I need to: a) take our son so he can be there b) go with him as support c) be the organiser for the family so kids are cared for, everyone is fed, and anything that needs someone thinking straight is taken care of. \nI could be meeting the King of fricking England and I'd drop him like a hot potato! \nI definitely feel like hubby is always a secondary thought here.", "And it's not like her cancelation would ruin her brother's night.  He would still be able to get dinner and/or come over to the house to meet over coffee.", "I think the brother and GF were exposed to toxic radiation \u2622\ufe0f, and only have 2-weeks to live. I totally get it.", "THIS.  No debate.  Family emergency = your plans are secondary to the emergency situation, period.", "In general we all agree there were plenty of ways OP and her kids could have helped that would have still allowed them all to continue their plans. I\u2019m not even going to bring up that one of them should have accompanied him to the hospital. I know that\u2019s way over the bar for them.", "She also says she has two kids, she does not say she has 3 kids. I feel sorry for the husband and 3 year old", "Funny how this is STILL an asshole move to suggest, but WAY better than the shit OP pulled lmao.", "How is saying no an option? If I was 17 and my dad needed something urgent, he's not asking, he's telling me I need to stay home. I get those are OP's kids, not her husband but still. Saying no it's not an option.", "Same. Maybe OP was in the middle of a business meeting and the kids were off somewhere far visiting family for the holidays. Nope, just your every day, run of the mill AHs. OP has serious issues if she thinks the reasons she listed are legitimately more important than a family emergency. YTA", "I was a child who spent her childhood raising younger siblings. So, I never wanted that for my kids and I was lucky enough to not need my older child to watch the younger one. BUT, . . , its not like I did not expect my kids to support the needs of the organism called our family. C'mon! That's not OK. So, if I'd called the eldest and told him to keep an eye on his little sister until I got there - he would just help me out. Its his family too, after all. I just never think that older children should always have the responsibility of managing younger siblings like I did. (My problem with it was that I had all of the responsibility and absolutely no authority to impose consequences for unsatisfactory behavior. I got yelled at and harassed and told how incompetent and and lazy I was when my younger siblings refused to do whatever they'd been assigned by our parents to perform. But, even with that disastrous modeling behavior - I still don't think that kids in a family don't have to help out. I just think they are no reasonable substitute for the parents.)", "I've dropped everything, got on a fucking plane and flown home a day early to get home and get my kids from my ex wife because she had a family emergency. Had my dad look after them for a few hours while I was in the air (youngest was a bit hard for him at the time for longer than that). I really could have said nah, and she would have found a friend or someone but it's my kids and my responsibility. OP is the ahole!", "Will be hearing from the wife in a sub Reddit saying \u201cmy husband left me because I went to lunch with my brother\u201d", "Here's hoping, poor guy deserves better.", "> That\u2019s just strange\n\nIt is not strange when you realize she suffers from \u201cI Am The Main Character\u201d syndrome. In her selfish update, she is claiming that her husband is abandoning her for Christmas.\n\n> He's now choosing to basically abandon us on christmas and also keep our son away from me and his siblings\n\nYou mean like how you /u/SquarePoint4234 and your two older children abandoned him during an emergency?\n\nAs for keeping you away from you and your children away from your youngest son, the three of you now have more time for brunch, studying, and hanging out with friends? You already indicated how those things were much more important than caring for your youngest child.", "We have a winner! OP goes with her husband to support him and her brother and his girlfriend go meet their nephew and play family for a few hours.\n\nSounds like a perfect solution. That meal must have been something else for them to choose it over their own family!", "Didn't even think of that tbh. Makes her an even bigger AH", "He should leave while they\u2019re not speaking to him."]}
