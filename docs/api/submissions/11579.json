You deciding to spew your pain all over another in pain is not conducive to being on the positive side of that statistic.\n\nDid you really need to come to AITA to hear the trope that it's not a joke if not everyone's laughing? And your attempt at equality reminds me of the argument a friend once made about how - back in the days of smoking in restaurants - if he had to sit in the non-smoking section to have dinner with his friends then the next time they should have to sit in the smoking section.

I'm sorry for your loss. But also for your wife.", "I'm going to say YTA, but in a gentle way because I understand. I also cope using humor and,  as an outsider, I think it's funny. BUT, you knew or should have known your wife would not approve of that joke and Jesus dude,  it's been 5 MONTHS MAX, it was waaaay too soon anyway. \n\nThe way she processes her grief doesn't hurt you and it doesn't keep you from healing. You can talk to others if you can't talk to her.

You did ask though.\n\nI am terribly sorry about your loss. I cannot even imagine the horrible hole that will always be present, and that you and your family will have to learn to move around.\n\nAnd having been through the sudden loss of a spouse, I would not want to criticize how someone else works through their own grief (as long as their actions aren't hurting others). You and your wife have different ways of walking this path, which can be common. It's also important to realize that this can lead to a breakdown of the marriage though, so you might want to seek counseling together on how to move forward and give each other grace.\n\nThat said, you clearly understood that humor is NOT how your wife deals with this kind of grief and you made a joke about the absolute worst thing that could ever happen to a parent, and which also occurred fairly recently. Just because you are the father/husband, you do not have the right to say something like that to her. You are free to use humor to work through your grief when you are with other people who will not be hurt by it. Your wife is not one of those people. I would also recommend caution about saying things like this around your sons. You may think they are okay with it, but they may be very uncomfortable and just don't know how to tell you that. They may also benefit from bereavement counselling for kids.\n\nEdit: also... you should not have said anything to your son about what happened except that **you said something that was hurtful to his mom**. You should not have said what it was, which feels a bit like you trying to get him to \"your side\" and also belittling your wife's feelings in the process.

Oh whatever the equivalent is. Sorry to hear.\n\nYTA. Just because you're a grieving father, that doesn't change what you can say to a grieving mother. It's not a close call at all.\n\n>I respect what she does\n\nYou come across as having a real fucked up way of showing it.\n\nThis is not about your respect for the dead, it's about your respect for the living. You can never say what you said to a woman (especially a woman) who has lost their child. Men do tend to be loose in their humor, and it can be our way of honoring that which we value. But you have to code-switch when the situation calls for it. You did not do that.\n\n>but she's got to respect what I do\n\nIf you want her to respect what you do, do it without her.\n\n>I think my wife is being extremely sensitive about this\n\nFor the sake of all that is holy, even if you *could* put a timeframe on grief, it hasn't even been a year! I have a co-worker who lost her husband maybe 8 years ago, and her personality changed permanently, there is a deadness in her that I have never seen leave her. I saw her claw her way back to becoming the pushy busybody of the office again when things were a little not-good--it was frankly a little ugly to watch her fight to maintain her passion for the job.

I respect what she does, but she's got to respect what I do\n\nHere's your mistake; you don't respect what she does, or you wouldn't have made the joke TO her. See, coping by way of humor IS ok. Yeah not everyone gets it (obviously, by her reaction and some comments so far) but it isn't for everyone to GET, it just is. It's a natural trauma response. HOWEVER; you KNOW how your wife is, yet this is the battle you chose? It isn't respect if you blatantly disregard them and they feelings with your words/ actions. You should have just said \"I'm sorry, I know you don't like to talk about it and I'm struggling by not doing so, so it came out in a bad joke. It won't happen again.\" \n\nFLIP SIDE; She's taking it wayyyy too far. Calling you a sociopath? Refusing to be near you? Raising concerns and fear over a NATURAL TRAUMA RESPONSE rather than even TRYING to talk it out? It's not ok. She isn't the only one grieving, and her way isn't the only way. She needs to at least make an attempt...\n\nHonestly. Probably an unpopular opinion here but ESH. There's a LOT to unpack here, and adding in grief really makes it all more difficult.

Everyone grieves differently, and everyone deserves to be allowed to grieve in their own way. I say \u201cgentle\u201d because I understand wanting to express your grief with your wife, or not to have to tiptoe around her, but also, since you knew she didn\u2019t like that sort of humor around this subject, it\u2019s a dick move. \n\nGet into a grief group where you can express your feelings freely, and encourage wife to do the same\u2014but please choose different groups.\n\nETA\u2014this is not a comment on your humor. I get gallows humor and don\u2019t have a problem with it\u2026But! I also get people who find it appalling. Know your audience.", "YTA. People always say they cope with humor and forget it's only cool if the person on the other end of the joke is cool with it. It would be frighteningly easy to take this situation in to completely, irredeemably FUBAR territory by continuing to insist a traumatized woman \"can't take a joke\" about her son's death. If there are family members and friends who are open to this humor, go ahead, but for God's sake, apologize to your wife and let her know that you're sorry you tried to involve her in a coping strategy that actually further traumatizes her.", "NAH. First of all, im so sorry about your son. I can\u2019t even imagine what you\u2019re all going through. I can see why the joke upset her, but like you said everyone grieves differently. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong to cope the way that works for you, but I also don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong to be offended by it. You should avoid these jokes around your wife since they obviously upset her and save them for maybe a close friend or family member who might take them better.", "Lol.... yeah YTA, not for the joke but for somehow not realizing it would upset her. You already said you know you grieve differently, so it would have been fine if you said it to, say, the kid who found it funny. Not to her, when you know that's not something that would be anything other that painful. I can't even imagine what you're all going through, but you need to smooth that over because you're at fault here.", "YTA. You can have whatever grieving response you want but forcing it on your wife, especially unexpectedly with random offhand comments, is absolutely inconsiderate AH behaviour.", "Jesus... I love some dark humor and found that pretty hilarious since you're all anonymous strangers to me, but read the damn room.  You have to know YTA for hitting her with that joke.", "Six months!", "And OP wants to paint it as \"she doesn't respect me, and I respect her\" when it's the opposite; it's also not difficult to *see* your partner that you supposedly have a strong relationship with is struggling and grieving, it's even *less* difficult to presume that after almost 20ys together, homeboy would know to *read the room* when it comes to his fucking wife.\n\nOP also threw in there at the end that his kid laughed too so, there, *he's justified*.", "A perfect response!", "As someone who has also experienced horrific grief in my life I can safely say that it is not your place to EVER tell someone who has experienced this kind of loss whether their way of coping is 'appropriate' or not. Please never do this again.", "Yep, he is on his way to grieving his marriage soon if he does not grasp what he did.", "I can't get behind this assessment. If OP's wife had simply overheard that little quip and been bothered by it, this would be an unfortunate situation. What he did was double down and insist his wife be able to to \"take a joke\" about their son's death. That's aggressive and cruel. A simple apology and promise not to say those things to someone who has been clear about how hurtful she finds them probably would have gone a long way. Instead of that, OP like, accused his spouse of not being a cool girl or something.", "Wife lost her son too. She doesn\u2019t want to hear morbid jokes about her dead child. If OP wants to tell those jokes, don\u2019t tell them *to her face.* YTA", "Her son has been dead a matter of months.  She doesn't find any humor in it.  She is not overreacting.  She can grieve her son how she wants.  Including not joking about it.", "Yta. You knew it was upset her and you did it anyway.    There\u2019s no reason for that.    It\u2019s her home too you know.   It should feel safe for her.  You clearly don\u2019t respect her.   And as a grieving parent,you have the right to grieve in your own way but I can guarantee you you are making everybody else, uncomfortable and miserable.  Get help.   I think you need it to process", "Eh, if he was joking like that with his friends it could be ok but not with his wife.  That\u2019s awful.", "Literally his own son, who also lost his brother, found it funny. So you're objectively wrong.\n\nNo, he probably shouldn't have said it to his wife, who he knows is particularly sensitive. But also, saying that \"no healthy human\" would find his coping mechanism appropriate or healthy is a terrible thing to say and objectively incorrect. He is still grieving as well, and it is not WRONG to grieve with humour, it can be a way to make the absolutely intolerable tolerable. Again, his own living child found the comment amusing, implying a shared sense of comfort in that sort of grim humour, a bond forged over trying to find a way to cope with their unbearable loss by gently poking fun at it.\n\nIt's one thing to say that he cannot and should not use this humour around everyone, and clearly not around his wife. But it's just cruel to suggest that there's something wrong or hateful about him for grieving the loss of his son in a way that he (and apparently his other child) finds helps him.", "That\u2019s the thing though - even if OP uses humor to cope doesn\u2019t give him blanket privilege to use said humor on wife who is also grieving. \n\nCoping with humor is healthy for him, great. That same humor hurts his wife - now it\u2019s not great. When in a relationship, it\u2019s a give and take. He can find friends or like-minded family where he can exercise his coping tools with - his wife isn\u2019t the person. \n\nHe\u2019s not totally TA because grief does things. But at least apologize and be more mindful of how he\u2019s using his humor in the future.\n\nEdit for spelling.", "This. I'm so horrified by all the people blasting him and talking about \"your grieving wife\" . . . who don't seem to realize that OP IS GRIEVING AS WELL. That this is literally his grief, his way of mourning the loss, of making the unbearable feel slightly more bearable. They're acting as though he made the joke because he finds the loss of his son hilarious, instead of because he's still trying to COPE with it by gently poking at the wound the way one does as the  healing process happens. \n\nHonestly, it hurts seeing the Y-T-A judgements that so clearly don't get that this man is just as grief-stricken as his wife, and that while he may have judged poorly in making the joke to her specifically, because of her sensitivity around it, that he is neither callous nor hateful, and certainly not deserving of vitriol.", "Except OP knows wife doesn\u2019t and knew before this joke. There was no other outcome other than to upset her. He should respect she doesn\u2019t want to hear jokes about her dead son, OP can say them to anyone else", "I gotta say, if you are ever again inclined to utter a sentence that goes 'You may have lost your child BUT...' just stop.", "It hasn't even been 6 months yet.", "Yeah, he knows she is dealing with the grief much differently than him, but he pushed his style on her knowing she wouldn\u2019t react like he would, he kinda got what he deserved by her reaction.  She isn\u2019t gonna respond to that type of humor.  Definitely needs to pick who he expresses his grief style too, definitely not to his wife.", "Thank you", "Lmao kids will laugh at anything, there is no justifying this", "I get dark humor\u2026I frequently have it, but he just shit the bed.", "I said \u201cno healthy human being would find your way of dealing with your sons passing to be healthy **if that\u2019s what it looks like.**\u201d You make jokes in front of people you know can handle it. That\u2019s not what happened here. \n\nIf your way of dealing with your grief requires making jokes you have every reason to know that your also-grieving spouse would find deeply offensive, then no, that is not healthy. Making jokes - fine. But telling your partner to effectively \u201csuck it up, this is how I grieve\u201d and making the joke knowing how it\u2019ll effect them - that is absolutely not healthy and not acceptable. \n\nAnd I stand by my comment that OP should see a grief counselor if they think this joke in this context was fine.\n\nEdit: let me add that I\u2019m assuming I\u2019d do a lot of fucked up things if I lost a child. Honestly, the fact that OP is still functioning at all is a feat I\u2019m not sure I could accomplish. But OP came here for feedback. And the feedback is that he screwed up.  Not acknowledging how harmful this comment was could literally lead to the end of his marriage. OP and his wife should go to a grief counselor together and separately to figure out how to navigate this situation in a way that is true to themselves but also respects and supports their partner", "OP is getting roasted because he didn\u2019t apologize when confronted by his wife, and then doubled down and basically said, \u201cTough.\u201d \n\nEveryone copes in their own way, but grieving and coping don\u2019t give you a pass to knowingly hurt people around you as you cope. That\u2019s what happened here. \n\nOP should make those jokes around people he knows can handle it, like his oldest son, and NOT his wife.", "As I said, they need to figure something out. Doesn't make him an AH for wanting to grieve in his own way.", "If his way of grieving is deliberately hurting his wife then it absolutely does make him an AH.", "People say things in grief sometimes without thinking about it. Doesn't mean he \"deliberately hurt his wife\". Accidents happen. I'm done explaining it to your pedantic brain. Goodbye."]}
