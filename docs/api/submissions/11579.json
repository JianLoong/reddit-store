You deciding to spew your pain all over another in pain is not conducive to being on the positive side of that statistic.\n\nDid you really need to come to AITA to hear the trope that it's not a joke if not everyone's laughing? And your attempt at equality reminds me of the argument a friend once made about how - back in the days of smoking in restaurants - if he had to sit in the non-smoking section to have dinner with his friends then the next time they should have to sit in the smoking section.

I'm sorry for your loss. But also for your wife.", "I'm going to say YTA, but in a gentle way because I understand. I also cope using humor and,  as an outsider, I think it's funny. BUT, you knew or should have known your wife would not approve of that joke and Jesus dude,  it's been 5 MONTHS MAX, it was waaaay too soon anyway. \n\nThe way she processes her grief doesn't hurt you and it doesn't keep you from healing. You can talk to others if you can't talk to her.

You did ask though.\n\nI am terribly sorry about your loss. I cannot even imagine the horrible hole that will always be present, and that you and your family will have to learn to move around.\n\nAnd having been through the sudden loss of a spouse, I would not want to criticize how someone else works through their own grief (as long as their actions aren't hurting others). You and your wife have different ways of walking this path, which can be common. It's also important to realize that this can lead to a breakdown of the marriage though, so you might want to seek counseling together on how to move forward and give each other grace.\n\nThat said, you clearly understood that humor is NOT how your wife deals with this kind of grief and you made a joke about the absolute worst thing that could ever happen to a parent, and which also occurred fairly recently. Just because you are the father/husband, you do not have the right to say something like that to her. You are free to use humor to work through your grief when you are with other people who will not be hurt by it. Your wife is not one of those people. I would also recommend caution about saying things like this around your sons. You may think they are okay with it, but they may be very uncomfortable and just don't know how to tell you that. They may also benefit from bereavement counselling for kids.\n\nEdit: also... you should not have said anything to your son about what happened except that **you said something that was hurtful to his mom**. You should not have said what it was, which feels a bit like you trying to get him to \"your side\" and also belittling your wife's feelings in the process.

Oh whatever the equivalent is. Sorry to hear.\n\nYTA. Just because you're a grieving father, that doesn't change what you can say to a grieving mother. It's not a close call at all.\n\n>I respect what she does\n\nYou come across as having a real fucked up way of showing it.\n\nThis is not about your respect for the dead, it's about your respect for the living. You can never say what you said to a woman (especially a woman) who has lost their child. Men do tend to be loose in their humor, and it can be our way of honoring that which we value. But you have to code-switch when the situation calls for it. You did not do that.\n\n>but she's got to respect what I do\n\nIf you want her to respect what you do, do it without her.\n\n>I think my wife is being extremely sensitive about this\n\nFor the sake of all that is holy, even if you *could* put a timeframe on grief, it hasn't even been a year! I have a co-worker who lost her husband maybe 8 years ago, and her personality changed permanently, there is a deadness in her that I have never seen leave her. I saw her claw her way back to becoming the pushy busybody of the office again when things were a little not-good--it was frankly a little ugly to watch her fight to maintain her passion for the job.

I respect what she does, but she's got to respect what I do\n\nHere's your mistake; you don't respect what she does, or you wouldn't have made the joke TO her. See, coping by way of humor IS ok. Yeah not everyone gets it (obviously, by her reaction and some comments so far) but it isn't for everyone to GET, it just is. It's a natural trauma response. HOWEVER; you KNOW how your wife is, yet this is the battle you chose? It isn't respect if you blatantly disregard them and they feelings with your words/ actions. You should have just said \"I'm sorry, I know you don't like to talk about it and I'm struggling by not doing so, so it came out in a bad joke. It won't happen again.\" \n\nFLIP SIDE; She's taking it wayyyy too far. Calling you a sociopath? Refusing to be near you? Raising concerns and fear over a NATURAL TRAUMA RESPONSE rather than even TRYING to talk it out? It's not ok. She isn't the only one grieving, and her way isn't the only way. She needs to at least make an attempt...\n\nHonestly. Probably an unpopular opinion here but ESH. There's a LOT to unpack here, and adding in grief really makes it all more difficult.

I'm so sorry for your loss firstly, I can't imagine what you guys are all going through. And I get that grieving is different for everyone, even including humour. If that's how you get through it then yes, absolutely that is valid. But the place isn't the issue, it's who you say the jokes to. Your son that laughed? Fine. Your wife, who clearly finds those jokes (or even discussions about your son) horrific and painful? Absolutely not. I feel like you should've been aware of that and considerate of that. Making sure not to make those jokes to her is important.\n\nIn the same way, your wife should be aware of how different your grieving process is and how you're not cold or a sociopath, you're just healing in your own way from what is easily one of, or the most, traumatic experiences of your lives. But I'm not going with \"everyone sucks\" because you guys lost one of your kids and that's terrible and I think being short with someone or butting heads over your conflicting grieving processes are quite expected difficulties.", "YTA, Im also a joke coper (when my dad died) but I refrain from joking about it with people, like my mother, who would be really hurt by it. Both of your styles of grieving are incompatible, and your style is one that actively causes her more pain.

He has the right to grieve anyway he needs in order to get through. Humor is a classic coping mechanism. While that may not be OP\u2019s wife\u2019s coping mechanism, that is OP\u2019s way of dealing with things. She needs to allow this child\u2019s father to grieve in his own way and OP needs to allow his wife to cope in her own way. Unfortunately, grief is experienced in so many different ways, and humor is a way to deal with grief. However, OP, you are certainly grieving and may need to reach out to a counselor who might help you get things sorted out so that you can deal with your grief. But again, you lost a child, too, and your wife\u2019s feelings don\u2019t supercede your own. Please don\u2019t listen to anyone telling you that you\u2019re an asshole! You are definitely not! You are dealing with grief in a normal way. You need to allow your wife to deal with her loss but you also should expect to able to grieve in your own way. I am so sorry for the loss of your 15 year old son. I cannot even imagine that pain. Op, and your entire family, please get counseling. Remember, just you and your wife have not dealt with this pain. Your other children need help to deal with it too. My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family!", "YTA- Yeah, you use humor to bring something light to a really hard situation, and that's fine.

Still, I think \"place\" should be my own home.\n\nIt's not about time & place. It's about what you acknowledged earlier -- very different styles of grief.\n\n>I respect what she does, but she's got to respect what I do.\n\nNot in this story, you didn't. It's fine to grieve differently than her; but forcing your humor on her when you already realize she doesn't like it is not respecting her differences. If you other son laughed and appreciated the joke, then there's your person to grieve with through humor. Share jokes like that with him or with friends. But don't share them with your wife.\n\nYour humor helps you cope; from her reaction, it sounds to me like your humor hurts her and makes her grief worse. Respecting her would mean saving the jokes for someone else.\n\nYTA because you sound like you already knew she grieves differently, but you  made this joke anyway and seem to think she should have to hear it out of \"respect\" for your coping mechanism. Your own home is her home, too. She deserves a safe haven to grieve in peace without \"jokes\" that hurt her.\n\nETA regardless, I'm deeply sorry for your loss. This sub can be a harsh place focused on judgement, and while I have to go with YTA for this situation, I'm sorry for your loss & your having to deal with this in the first place.

For you, talking about your son may be a way to keep him in your daily life.

She isn\u2019t an asshole in how she grieves, neither are you about the way you grieve. You said your son died in October? That was give or take 6 months ago, that\u2019s still a recent and devastating loss.\n\nWhile your joke was part of your grieving process and while it was a hit for the oldest, and I found it quite funny myself, you have to understand where your wife is coming from. It took my Nan a couple of years to feel comfortable taking about grandad openly and making jokes about the fact that he isn\u2019t around anymore, so imagine how she must be feeling after losing a child. No parent, you, her or otherwise, should have to bury their babies.\n\nMaybe one day you and her can grieve together and joke about him, or maybe you never will because grief doesn\u2019t get smaller. You need a healthy and personal way to cope and if this is it then good for you! Sometimes laughing about it can help. Your oldest seems to think so too. But you BOTH need to understand that not everyone grieves the same. You both need to apologise to eachother, her calling you a pig was not right, but she is not being over sensitive about the death of her child.\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, how sensitive do you feel about his death? Because obviously you should be sad, but by that statement it makes me think that you\u2019re not quite that. Are you in denial? My Nan was for ages, but cried a lot by herself. But around people she was completely different. \n\nI know this is a long reply, but grief counselling is and can be a very valuable tool in a marriage. Child loss can drive people apart (especially couples with different grief processes). Consider reaching out. For the sake of your marriage. Even if it\u2019s in another 6 months, or if things don\u2019t improve. But you BOTH need to apologise. Her for calling you names and denying you your process to grieve, and you for thinking she\u2019s too sensitive about the issue.", "You don\u2019t want to be judged for your grieving process but judge hers? It\u2019s not hard to respect what she needs to do and still grieve in your own way. I think you guys may benefit from couples and grief counseling because what you two have been through is something no parent should ever have to go through. It is still very recent and raw for you both I assume and there is no timeline for grief is stays with you forever and lives parallel to every life experience you will ever have until you yourself pass. Both be kind to each other and take the time to listen to the other about what you both need during this time. Also don\u2019t forget your other children know what is going on and see you two struggling so be kind.", "YTA. You knew that \"joke\" would hurt her, and you did it anyway.", "YTA\n\nYou're not actually respecting that she doesn't cope with humor if you make jokes about her traumatic loss to her. It's your traumatic loss too of course, but it's equally her traumatic loss, and she deserves to not have you retraumatizing her in her own home. You know it upsets her and you're doing it anyway. I cope with my grief via humor as well, but you are actually being callous towards her. Using humor to cope doesn't mean you have the right to upset others with your coping mechanism. You're fine hurting her because you feel you should have a right to hurt her in your own home? Your logic is ridiculous. You are not thinking clearly. \n\nIt sounds to me like you have some anger towards her for not wanting to talk about him and what happened, for processing her grief in a way that stifles your processing. For how you're expected to respect that and not hurt her, but she isn't expected to accept what you need in return. Here's the problem: grief isn't fair. If you continue down this path, you'll see why so many marriages fall apart after losing a child. You've already knowingly chosen to hurt her about the worst thing in her life, so you really need to take stock here. It is not either of your faults that the way you grieve is not compatible. As unfair as it feels, you owe each other boundaries, which you just trampled, but she does not owe you conversations and comfortability with jokes that she is not ready for. It's just different. \n\nYou may feel like you're being just as actively hurt by her moratorium on talking about your son as she's hurt by your joke. But viewing it that way is incredibly unhealthy. I don't know if you have a counselor, but even if you can't find one, you need to find ways to cope with your need to talk that don't require violating your wife's boundaries around her trauma. A support group, regular meetups with friends who you feel you can talk to, outings with your sons where you talk about him, etc. Even journaling could help, since you seem to process externally more than internally. \n\nI know you probably want to be able to process this with the only other person who understands the experience of being his parent, and losing him as his parent, and you feel like you're lacking that unique support from your wife. But grief can disassociate you from your true feelings, and not realizing how much resentment you hold towards a fragile person in your life can be dangerous and lead to irreparable harm in the relationship. It's okay to feel that resentment, but you need to deal with it without forcing pain on her. Way too many parents take their own lives after losing a child. Do not take your wife's boundaries lightly. And do not take your own needs or feelings lightly either. I don't mean don't joke, but I mean don't just repress it until it comes out like this.\n\nExplain to your wife what's been going on for you, how you've felt unable to grieve the way you need to because of being careful for her, and what steps you're going to take to find solutions. Explain that you don't think it's funny that he died, but that humor is a way to meet your need to acknowledge him and what happened without having to be vulnerable or make it a big deal every time. She doesn't understand, and all she sees right now is a man who just intentionally hurt her in the cruelest way she can imagine and then claimed it was a joke and it was her problem that she was hurt by it. Her hurt over hearing jokes is just as natural as your need to joke, so you don't get to say that she just needs to tolerate the hurt. I know you're saying it from a place of hurt too, but it's easier for you to joke with whoever literally anywhere, except when she's there, than it is for her to avoid reminders. Would you knowingly trigger someone with PTSD about an incident because you wanted to talk about it? The answer is yes, you would, because that's essentially what you did to her. I hope regular you wouldn't do that, but grieving you is being an asshole right now. I say that as someone currently grieving. You can ask her to help you brainstorm ways to find time/spaces to meet your needs, if that would help you feel more supported in the relationship. Just don't make your home a place where she feels unsafe. You need to apologize.", "Meh - soft YTA. If it helps, I thought the joke was pretty funny.\n\nOf course, this come a father who takes his daughter to Comicon to celebrate her getting out of rehab (for heroin) and bought her a Comicon t-shirt that said \u201cHeroine Addict\u201d.

And I'm one of them. \n\nUnfortunately what happened here was that a) you involved your wife in your coping mechanism that she doesn't share, and b) you blindsided her by forcing her to think about it very explicitly when she was trying to get through her daily tasks. \n\n>I think my wife is being extremely sensitive about this,\n\nYa think? I expect that pain will be very raw for her for a long time, it might be something she just can't joke about ever. \n\n>I respect what she does, but she's got to respect what I do.\n\nI'm not sure you do respect her grieving process, or at least you don't act on that respect. You are welcome to your coping mechanisms but that doesn't mean you involve her in them, she clearly doesn't appreciate them.

You gotta know your crowd bro, especially if it's your wife who is, just like you, dealing with an unspeakable tradgedy.

You and your wife are at an impasse because your style is hurting her and her style is hurting you. Yes she\u2019s extremely sensitive- she lost a child. It\u2019s understandable and normal to be extremely sensitive. She may always be extremely sensitive. And while you should cope in your own way, it\u2019s insensitive of you to ignore your wife\u2019s feelings on this subject. I\u2019m refraining from calling you an asshole over the way you are grieving the loss of your child, but you were insensitive to your wife. Honestly, if you love you wife and you want your marriage to stay functional, please go to grief counseling together so a professional can help y\u2019all navigate through this landline of emotions.

Unfortunately, YTA. Your behavior towards your wife is terribly insensitive, and there was no reason to tell your son the details about why his mother was upset. \n\nYou could have truthfully just said that she was sad about his brother. But it seems like you wanted validation that your joke was okay. Triangulating a marital conflict in that way hurts your child, too.\n\nI imagine that individual and family/couples counseling would be a great idea here.

I know others like this, and my family tends to make a lot of \"off-color\" jokes about relatives when they pass.\n\nHowever, I think what happens next is what defines whether or not you're the AH. Your wife is uncomfortable with the joke, and she's grieving too. Stop explaining, stop defending yourself, and apologize to her. Don't make jokes like that around her for a while (maybe ever).

The wife has made it extremely clear she isn't ready to talk about her loss, let alone in the way OP wants to. She isn't forcing him to do anything. She just doesn't want him to talk like that *with her*. She's allowed that boundary. He can either respect it & wait for her, ask for couple's therapy or leave the relationship, but since he says they are otherwise close, that would be a heartbreaking conclusion.

Have you thought about the psychological impact of your words on her?\n\nI'm like you, I process trauma with dark humour - I _get_ it. I would definitely have laughed.

Perhaps it comes across as a joke, humour to him but I think the original poster is actually confused and that this was a deep feeling of sadness and loss and anger that their son was no longer there and he replied in the moment. Naturally his wife was angry and upset but I don\u2019t believe there was any intent to be mean or \u201cmaking light\u201d of the situation.

So terribly sad my heart breaks for their family.", "And it doesn\u2019t sound like he wants to talk about it - more like he\u2019s waiting to inform her of his position on it.", "For relationships my personal rule is if I do/say this thing, how will it affect my partner. If I know it will hurt then I won\u2019t do it, because I don\u2019t want to hurt my partner. My partner respects me the same way and will not always act on things he wants to because he knows it may hurt my feelings.

They are each blaming the other for how they grieve. He should understand she doesn\u2019t grieve like him and not make jokes like that in front of her.

OP is not being prevented from joking about it *at all*, just with his wife. \n\nA huge number of marriages break down after the death of a child because, under normal circumstances, your spouse is your main support system. When one is going down the other is there to catch them. But when you are both going down together neither one of you has the strength to be the catcher, which is why having friends is so important. OP should take those dark jokes to his friends and let them catch him while he falls. His wife can throw herself into time with her friends until she\u2019s ready to talk. \n\nThe more OP tries to *make* his wife catch him the more likely it is that she will pull away out of self-preservation. It also slows down her grieving process because she\u2019s now afraid that if she does try to talk about it he\u2019s going to start telling jokes and she can\u2019t handle that.", "Last two sentences of the first paragraph\n\n>I really like to talk about my son and what happened to him, but she wants to process things by herself and doesn't want to talk about it.

The kid laughed,  it doesn't mean he liked the joke or the joking.  Socially it was a moment to laugh to break the tension.

Death and greif can be so heavy that it buries all the joy you experienced for the person who is gone....for me dark humor is like a way of stabbing at the darkness making it less huge", "I feel like it has to be a gentle YTA. You're insinuating he just freely and happily chose to make this joke with this all knowing idea that it was going to upset her.\n\nIn the moment, he thought about his children. And he thought about his loss, and his immediate reaction was his trauma reaction of making a joke to ease the pain. It was inappropriate given the situation and his company, clearly, but it's not like in his head the thought that she would be upset about it came up. It wasn't necessarily a conscious decision, it was a reaction to trauma. \n\nIt was a mistake, but we're fallible. Everyone of us here is. And dealing with the death of a child deserves some leeway. The wife should be understanding of that also, but at the same time she has every right to be upset at that joke.", "And for me it happened 5-6 months ago. So I can see why the wife was upset and doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. Yes OP also lost a child. But doesn\u2019t say how the son died.

Why does he have to swallow his feelings be the one to shoulder the burden of keeping his family together? It should be a joint effort between him & his wife. It is unbelievably cruel to assign the responsibility of maintaining his marriage & being everyone else\u2019s source of support, solely on him. OP just has to suck it up & try to find ways to bridge the distance between him & his wife, with no expectation of the same from her? Just because on the surface it may appear that OP isn\u2019t struggling like his wife is, or that her expression of grief is more typical & therefore more acceptable, does not mean that this man isn\u2019t going through it. \n\nWith verdicts like this the poor man could be driven to a breakdown.

Six months & he\u2019s expected to be well adjusted enough that he can intuit what the rest of the family need, & never have a blip himself, or make a mistake, or have a wobble. If he experiences a moment of overwhelming emotional strife, he better keep it to himself, because there\u2019s no compassion leftover for him. Absolutely unbelievable how cruel people\u2019s expectations of him are.

She's stuck in basically denying son's existence because it hurts to accept that he's gone. but that's not healthy and if OP didn't make this joke I honestly believe it would merely be enabling her. On top of it he needed it for his own grieving process. \n\nTo Demand that he grieve in a way that pushes the existence of his son aside is just cruel and sick. \n\nnow if done in public I would see this as a problem but in your own home this is perfectly normal behavior. \n\nOP is NTA", "The initial joke wasn't really OP's biggest problem though. Yeah it was insensitive, but it's human to have moments of insensitivity, doubly so when dealing with such a massive tragedy.\n\nHowever... what does take OP squarely into AH territory is bringing his other son into the argument and writing his wife off as \"I think my wife is being extremely sensitive about this\". I think it's just gross af to call a grieving parent \"sensitive\" in the first place. Also, his son is grieving his brother as well and doesn't need to have OP trying to use him to score points against Mom on top of that. Super inappropriate.\n\nI also have to wonder if OP makes a habit of belittling his wife's feelings as \"being sensitive\", and if so... well, maybe there's a reason she doesn't feel particularly good about opening up to him.", "He says it happened late October.
