You deciding to spew your pain all over another in pain is not conducive to being on the positive side of that statistic.\n\nDid you really need to come to AITA to hear the trope that it's not a joke if not everyone's laughing? And your attempt at equality reminds me of the argument a friend once made about how - back in the days of smoking in restaurants - if he had to sit in the non-smoking section to have dinner with his friends then the next time they should have to sit in the smoking section.

I'm sorry for your loss. But also for your wife.", "I'm going to say YTA, but in a gentle way because I understand. I also cope using humor and,  as an outsider, I think it's funny. BUT, you knew or should have known your wife would not approve of that joke and Jesus dude,  it's been 5 MONTHS MAX, it was waaaay too soon anyway. \n\nThe way she processes her grief doesn't hurt you and it doesn't keep you from healing. You can talk to others if you can't talk to her.

You did ask though.\n\nI am terribly sorry about your loss. I cannot even imagine the horrible hole that will always be present, and that you and your family will have to learn to move around.\n\nAnd having been through the sudden loss of a spouse, I would not want to criticize how someone else works through their own grief (as long as their actions aren't hurting others). You and your wife have different ways of walking this path, which can be common. It's also important to realize that this can lead to a breakdown of the marriage though, so you might want to seek counseling together on how to move forward and give each other grace.\n\nThat said, you clearly understood that humor is NOT how your wife deals with this kind of grief and you made a joke about the absolute worst thing that could ever happen to a parent, and which also occurred fairly recently. Just because you are the father/husband, you do not have the right to say something like that to her. You are free to use humor to work through your grief when you are with other people who will not be hurt by it. Your wife is not one of those people. I would also recommend caution about saying things like this around your sons. You may think they are okay with it, but they may be very uncomfortable and just don't know how to tell you that. They may also benefit from bereavement counselling for kids.\n\nEdit: also... you should not have said anything to your son about what happened except that **you said something that was hurtful to his mom**. You should not have said what it was, which feels a bit like you trying to get him to \"your side\" and also belittling your wife's feelings in the process.

Oh whatever the equivalent is. Sorry to hear.\n\nYTA. Just because you're a grieving father, that doesn't change what you can say to a grieving mother. It's not a close call at all.\n\n>I respect what she does\n\nYou come across as having a real fucked up way of showing it.\n\nThis is not about your respect for the dead, it's about your respect for the living. You can never say what you said to a woman (especially a woman) who has lost their child. Men do tend to be loose in their humor, and it can be our way of honoring that which we value. But you have to code-switch when the situation calls for it. You did not do that.\n\n>but she's got to respect what I do\n\nIf you want her to respect what you do, do it without her.\n\n>I think my wife is being extremely sensitive about this\n\nFor the sake of all that is holy, even if you *could* put a timeframe on grief, it hasn't even been a year! I have a co-worker who lost her husband maybe 8 years ago, and her personality changed permanently, there is a deadness in her that I have never seen leave her. I saw her claw her way back to becoming the pushy busybody of the office again when things were a little not-good--it was frankly a little ugly to watch her fight to maintain her passion for the job.

I respect what she does, but she's got to respect what I do\n\nHere's your mistake; you don't respect what she does, or you wouldn't have made the joke TO her. See, coping by way of humor IS ok. Yeah not everyone gets it (obviously, by her reaction and some comments so far) but it isn't for everyone to GET, it just is. It's a natural trauma response. HOWEVER; you KNOW how your wife is, yet this is the battle you chose? It isn't respect if you blatantly disregard them and they feelings with your words/ actions. You should have just said \"I'm sorry, I know you don't like to talk about it and I'm struggling by not doing so, so it came out in a bad joke. It won't happen again.\" \n\nFLIP SIDE; She's taking it wayyyy too far. Calling you a sociopath? Refusing to be near you? Raising concerns and fear over a NATURAL TRAUMA RESPONSE rather than even TRYING to talk it out? It's not ok. She isn't the only one grieving, and her way isn't the only way. She needs to at least make an attempt...\n\nHonestly. Probably an unpopular opinion here but ESH. There's a LOT to unpack here, and adding in grief really makes it all more difficult.

I'm so sorry for your loss firstly, I can't imagine what you guys are all going through. And I get that grieving is different for everyone, even including humour. If that's how you get through it then yes, absolutely that is valid. But the place isn't the issue, it's who you say the jokes to. Your son that laughed? Fine. Your wife, who clearly finds those jokes (or even discussions about your son) horrific and painful? Absolutely not. I feel like you should've been aware of that and considerate of that. Making sure not to make those jokes to her is important.\n\nIn the same way, your wife should be aware of how different your grieving process is and how you're not cold or a sociopath, you're just healing in your own way from what is easily one of, or the most, traumatic experiences of your lives. But I'm not going with \"everyone sucks\" because you guys lost one of your kids and that's terrible and I think being short with someone or butting heads over your conflicting grieving processes are quite expected difficulties.", "YTA, Im also a joke coper (when my dad died) but I refrain from joking about it with people, like my mother, who would be really hurt by it. Both of your styles of grieving are incompatible, and your style is one that actively causes her more pain.

He has the right to grieve anyway he needs in order to get through. Humor is a classic coping mechanism. While that may not be OP\u2019s wife\u2019s coping mechanism, that is OP\u2019s way of dealing with things. She needs to allow this child\u2019s father to grieve in his own way and OP needs to allow his wife to cope in her own way. Unfortunately, grief is experienced in so many different ways, and humor is a way to deal with grief. However, OP, you are certainly grieving and may need to reach out to a counselor who might help you get things sorted out so that you can deal with your grief. But again, you lost a child, too, and your wife\u2019s feelings don\u2019t supercede your own. Please don\u2019t listen to anyone telling you that you\u2019re an asshole! You are definitely not! You are dealing with grief in a normal way. You need to allow your wife to deal with her loss but you also should expect to able to grieve in your own way. I am so sorry for the loss of your 15 year old son. I cannot even imagine that pain. Op, and your entire family, please get counseling. Remember, just you and your wife have not dealt with this pain. Your other children need help to deal with it too. My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family!", "YTA- Yeah, you use humor to bring something light to a really hard situation, and that's fine.

Still, I think \"place\" should be my own home.\n\nIt's not about time & place. It's about what you acknowledged earlier -- very different styles of grief.\n\n>I respect what she does, but she's got to respect what I do.\n\nNot in this story, you didn't. It's fine to grieve differently than her; but forcing your humor on her when you already realize she doesn't like it is not respecting her differences. If you other son laughed and appreciated the joke, then there's your person to grieve with through humor. Share jokes like that with him or with friends. But don't share them with your wife.\n\nYour humor helps you cope; from her reaction, it sounds to me like your humor hurts her and makes her grief worse. Respecting her would mean saving the jokes for someone else.\n\nYTA because you sound like you already knew she grieves differently, but you  made this joke anyway and seem to think she should have to hear it out of \"respect\" for your coping mechanism. Your own home is her home, too. She deserves a safe haven to grieve in peace without \"jokes\" that hurt her.\n\nETA regardless, I'm deeply sorry for your loss. This sub can be a harsh place focused on judgement, and while I have to go with YTA for this situation, I'm sorry for your loss & your having to deal with this in the first place.

For you, talking about your son may be a way to keep him in your daily life.

She isn\u2019t an asshole in how she grieves, neither are you about the way you grieve. You said your son died in October? That was give or take 6 months ago, that\u2019s still a recent and devastating loss.\n\nWhile your joke was part of your grieving process and while it was a hit for the oldest, and I found it quite funny myself, you have to understand where your wife is coming from. It took my Nan a couple of years to feel comfortable taking about grandad openly and making jokes about the fact that he isn\u2019t around anymore, so imagine how she must be feeling after losing a child. No parent, you, her or otherwise, should have to bury their babies.\n\nMaybe one day you and her can grieve together and joke about him, or maybe you never will because grief doesn\u2019t get smaller. You need a healthy and personal way to cope and if this is it then good for you! Sometimes laughing about it can help. Your oldest seems to think so too. But you BOTH need to understand that not everyone grieves the same. You both need to apologise to eachother, her calling you a pig was not right, but she is not being over sensitive about the death of her child.\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, how sensitive do you feel about his death? Because obviously you should be sad, but by that statement it makes me think that you\u2019re not quite that. Are you in denial? My Nan was for ages, but cried a lot by herself. But around people she was completely different. \n\nI know this is a long reply, but grief counselling is and can be a very valuable tool in a marriage. Child loss can drive people apart (especially couples with different grief processes). Consider reaching out. For the sake of your marriage. Even if it\u2019s in another 6 months, or if things don\u2019t improve. But you BOTH need to apologise. Her for calling you names and denying you your process to grieve, and you for thinking she\u2019s too sensitive about the issue.", "You don\u2019t want to be judged for your grieving process but judge hers? It\u2019s not hard to respect what she needs to do and still grieve in your own way. I think you guys may benefit from couples and grief counseling because what you two have been through is something no parent should ever have to go through. It is still very recent and raw for you both I assume and there is no timeline for grief is stays with you forever and lives parallel to every life experience you will ever have until you yourself pass. Both be kind to each other and take the time to listen to the other about what you both need during this time. Also don\u2019t forget your other children know what is going on and see you two struggling so be kind.", "YTA. You knew that \"joke\" would hurt her, and you did it anyway.", "YTA\n\nYou're not actually respecting that she doesn't cope with humor if you make jokes about her traumatic loss to her. It's your traumatic loss too of course, but it's equally her traumatic loss, and she deserves to not have you retraumatizing her in her own home. You know it upsets her and you're doing it anyway. I cope with my grief via humor as well, but you are actually being callous towards her. Using humor to cope doesn't mean you have the right to upset others with your coping mechanism. You're fine hurting her because you feel you should have a right to hurt her in your own home? Your logic is ridiculous. You are not thinking clearly. \n\nIt sounds to me like you have some anger towards her for not wanting to talk about him and what happened, for processing her grief in a way that stifles your processing. For how you're expected to respect that and not hurt her, but she isn't expected to accept what you need in return. Here's the problem: grief isn't fair. If you continue down this path, you'll see why so many marriages fall apart after losing a child. You've already knowingly chosen to hurt her about the worst thing in her life, so you really need to take stock here. It is not either of your faults that the way you grieve is not compatible. As unfair as it feels, you owe each other boundaries, which you just trampled, but she does not owe you conversations and comfortability with jokes that she is not ready for. It's just different. \n\nYou may feel like you're being just as actively hurt by her moratorium on talking about your son as she's hurt by your joke. But viewing it that way is incredibly unhealthy. I don't know if you have a counselor, but even if you can't find one, you need to find ways to cope with your need to talk that don't require violating your wife's boundaries around her trauma. A support group, regular meetups with friends who you feel you can talk to, outings with your sons where you talk about him, etc. Even journaling could help, since you seem to process externally more than internally. \n\nI know you probably want to be able to process this with the only other person who understands the experience of being his parent, and losing him as his parent, and you feel like you're lacking that unique support from your wife. But grief can disassociate you from your true feelings, and not realizing how much resentment you hold towards a fragile person in your life can be dangerous and lead to irreparable harm in the relationship. It's okay to feel that resentment, but you need to deal with it without forcing pain on her. Way too many parents take their own lives after losing a child. Do not take your wife's boundaries lightly. And do not take your own needs or feelings lightly either. I don't mean don't joke, but I mean don't just repress it until it comes out like this.\n\nExplain to your wife what's been going on for you, how you've felt unable to grieve the way you need to because of being careful for her, and what steps you're going to take to find solutions. Explain that you don't think it's funny that he died, but that humor is a way to meet your need to acknowledge him and what happened without having to be vulnerable or make it a big deal every time. She doesn't understand, and all she sees right now is a man who just intentionally hurt her in the cruelest way she can imagine and then claimed it was a joke and it was her problem that she was hurt by it. Her hurt over hearing jokes is just as natural as your need to joke, so you don't get to say that she just needs to tolerate the hurt. I know you're saying it from a place of hurt too, but it's easier for you to joke with whoever literally anywhere, except when she's there, than it is for her to avoid reminders. Would you knowingly trigger someone with PTSD about an incident because you wanted to talk about it? The answer is yes, you would, because that's essentially what you did to her. I hope regular you wouldn't do that, but grieving you is being an asshole right now. I say that as someone currently grieving. You can ask her to help you brainstorm ways to find time/spaces to meet your needs, if that would help you feel more supported in the relationship. Just don't make your home a place where she feels unsafe. You need to apologize.", "Meh - soft YTA. If it helps, I thought the joke was pretty funny.\n\nOf course, this come a father who takes his daughter to Comicon to celebrate her getting out of rehab (for heroin) and bought her a Comicon t-shirt that said \u201cHeroine Addict\u201d.

And I'm one of them. \n\nUnfortunately what happened here was that a) you involved your wife in your coping mechanism that she doesn't share, and b) you blindsided her by forcing her to think about it very explicitly when she was trying to get through her daily tasks. \n\n>I think my wife is being extremely sensitive about this,\n\nYa think? I expect that pain will be very raw for her for a long time, it might be something she just can't joke about ever. \n\n>I respect what she does, but she's got to respect what I do.\n\nI'm not sure you do respect her grieving process, or at least you don't act on that respect. You are welcome to your coping mechanisms but that doesn't mean you involve her in them, she clearly doesn't appreciate them.

You gotta know your crowd bro, especially if it's your wife who is, just like you, dealing with an unspeakable tradgedy.

You and your wife are at an impasse because your style is hurting her and her style is hurting you. Yes she\u2019s extremely sensitive- she lost a child. It\u2019s understandable and normal to be extremely sensitive. She may always be extremely sensitive. And while you should cope in your own way, it\u2019s insensitive of you to ignore your wife\u2019s feelings on this subject. I\u2019m refraining from calling you an asshole over the way you are grieving the loss of your child, but you were insensitive to your wife. Honestly, if you love you wife and you want your marriage to stay functional, please go to grief counseling together so a professional can help y\u2019all navigate through this landline of emotions.

Unfortunately, YTA. Your behavior towards your wife is terribly insensitive, and there was no reason to tell your son the details about why his mother was upset. \n\nYou could have truthfully just said that she was sad about his brother. But it seems like you wanted validation that your joke was okay. Triangulating a marital conflict in that way hurts your child, too.\n\nI imagine that individual and family/couples counseling would be a great idea here.

I know others like this, and my family tends to make a lot of \"off-color\" jokes about relatives when they pass.\n\nHowever, I think what happens next is what defines whether or not you're the AH. Your wife is uncomfortable with the joke, and she's grieving too. Stop explaining, stop defending yourself, and apologize to her. Don't make jokes like that around her for a while (maybe ever).

Maybe to some of your friends or maybe join a mourning support group and find people that grieve like you and do it amount the group.\n\nTake care.", "This.\n\nI sincerely hope OP and his wife get some counseling, for themselves and for their surviving children.  These sort of events can destroy families, and they are definitely (understandably!) having difficulty walking through it.", "She needs to have some consideration for her husband and how HER grieving style is complicating his life.", "It hasn\u2019t even been HALF a year", "\ud83d\udcaf TA for these remarks. Do I use dark humor to cope with my daughter's death yes, bur I don't expect others to accept it. There are no titles for losing a child because there are no rules to the grief.", "Idk, man... my grandpa didn't tell us his oldest son died until we got back from disney world. I found out by my grandpa going, \"hey, your uncle tommy is in the front seat of my car. Wanna meet him?\" Then pulled out the fucking urn with Tommy's name on it.", "He also ambushed her with a reminder of the death AND made it a joke.\n\nSomething I'm working with about my small kid is he will just randomly bring up \"my grandpa is dead\".  It's definitely something that you can tell throws off my husband and mother in law when he does it.  You just have a random conversation and he'll just be asking about grandpa.\n\nBut, you know, he's four.  He doesn't understand what he's doing. When you're an adult you don't just derail something suddenly like that.  Part of the grieving process is not having your first thought in your mind all the time of \"my Dad's gone\" or \"my kid is gone\".  You just don't ambush someone like that.", "Shouldn\u2019t she be a little more sensitive to his needs as well? Being in a relationship means you work together to heal. Not I\u2019m this way and they\u2019re that way because nobody is legitimately able to move on if the other won\u2019t. Grief is weird and I hate they\u2019re going through this, but you can\u2019t expect to have equal ways of coping. So ESH and at the same point nobody does.", "This 100% \u261d\ufe0f", "That joke could well be the trigger that sends her on her way out of the marriage. Nothing worse than hearing someone make a joke involving the recent death of their child, \\*which is possibly how it hit her\\*...after 20 years of marriage, the husband who is \"close to his wife\" doesn't know that instinctively?", "How is her refusing to talk about their son not hurting him or not shutting him out?", "But her method does impact him, he wants to talk about their son and she basically refuses to.", "No! Please halfcookies! Dont tell him to do anything like this! It would only make things worse.\n\nLosing a son.. any child is so devastatingly shattering, no mother ever really \u201cgets over it\u201d. She only learns to control and tame her grief tsunamis over time. There is nothing funny or humorous to be found in the loss of a child. Nothing. Now she has just found out her husband, his father callously disrespected her broken heart and road blocked her very hard path back to a semblance of ever feeling happy again.", "On the other hand, I would guess failing to jointly process the grief is probably *also* a good way to find out. Two people with diametrically opposed/mutually incompatible grief responses is...not an easy problem to solve or navigate. That's why so many people are suggesting counseling for all involved.", ">Cope how you want, but respect that your wife copes differently.\n\nHe does.\n\n>**I really like to talk about my son and what happened to him,** but she wants to process things by herself and doesn't want to talk about it. We still have a very close marriage, **we just talk about everything other than our son.**\n\nShe's the one whose grieving process is constantly respected, while his is being completely dismissed. The one time he dared to do it his way in front of her, he gets insulted. And you tell him to apologise. Like, no.", "Yeah, this one is hard for me. I get he could be the AH...but he's never allowed to talk about their son with his WIFE. He respects that boundary. So he kinda should get a pass because it goes both ways. I'm so sorry for your loss. NTA.", "Perhaps they could talk about that in therapy.  Making a random joke about likely isn\u2019t the appropriate way to begin that conversation", "Oof. First of all sorry for your family\u2019s loss. \n\nAnd I totally agree\u2014our kids do this about our dogs that have passed, and it\u2019s a blindside Every. Single. Time. \n\nI know it\u2019s how they\u2019re processing but it\u2019s like damn, kid.", "but hasn't she also pushed her style on him by not allowing him to ever be talked about? if i can't talk about my late child with my partner i think that would be a deal breaker. i never realized it til this post. but at some point we would need to mention them even if we started slow because if i was avoiding it i would be avoiding the reality and if i needed it and couldn't... i would be hurting.\n\nhe passed in october, grief isn't linear but at some point avoiding mentioning him is beyond reasonable and only allows her grieving style. i'm not saying 4/5 months is that time frame but maybe he should have mentioned their son in a different manner to test those waters or talk to her.\n\nhis joke, totally wrong crowd and not sure what he expected.", "I would like to point out that they way she is grieving is essentially pushing her own style on him.  He wants to talk about it and she won't. She's neglecting his grieving.\n\nYes op was an asshole in those moments but she isn't absolved from her kinda being an asshole too.", "That's why I didn't put a judgment. They're both probably doing the best they can and they didn't choose the method that works for them.", "Hi woman who dealt with her daughters death and now is dealing with her dad's death through humor. Even some morbid humor.", "I know. I chuckled reading it.", "I have a feeling you're neuro-typical.", "There are ways to share in sadness that don't involve upsetting your partner in grief. I get some people cope with humor, but clearly she doesn't. He knows that, but doubled down on being \"right\" by involving his child. I feel awful for them both, but he messed up and was an AH", "Pretty sure they were being sarcastic", "Yeah but the question was, \u201cis he an asshole?\u201d, not \u201chow to navigate grief in a partnership?\u201d And he was an asshole. And, \u201cdon\u2019t joke TO ME about my dead child\u201d shouldn\u2019t be an INCOMPATIBLE grief response unless he\u2019s a complete and total asshole.", "There are other people he can talk to, though. Obviously it would be better if they could talk about their son together, but their current styles are incompatible. If I were the wife, I can't fathom having conversations like \"haha, our dead son is where we left him!\" That gave me goosebumps just to read and I don't know this family. That joke would make me sick to my stomach if it were about someone I loved.\n\nI think OP has to accept this his style of grieving is not only different from hers but different from typical norms. I would be willing to bet not many people can handle morbid jokes about such a deeply painful topic, especially so soon. A better compromise might be asking if there are times they can share memories about their son in a respectful, tasteful way. But to ask someone who's struggling to even talk about their son to make jokes about him is a huge ask. Both need to grieve, and if OP can't grieve the way he wants to with her, he needs to rely on a therapist, other family and friends for those coping styles. Not force her to endure painful, morbid jokes.", "Talking with her is one thing; making a joke about it is something else entirely. Someone who can't bear to discuss it is pretty obviously not going to be OK with joking about it. And he clearly doesn't respect his wife's boundary if he takes a flying leap over it to not just talk about it but make a joke which any reasonable person would expect to be upsetting to her.", "No, the poster is saying that's how the wife *prefers* to grieve, at least per the OP's description, and then contrasts it with the husband's desire to talk. Not that she should be *expected* to process it quietly. The whole disconnect here, (again, taking OP at his word) is that OP wants to talk and his wife wants to grieve privately.\n\nFor reference (from OP):\n>We still have a very close marriage, we just talk about everything other than our son.", "She is just bottling up. She's not talking about the dead kid at all. If we take what OP is saying to be true. She's practically ignoring the kids existence. You think that's healthy?", "She needs to go to therapy herself to learn techniques to stop sabotaging her family by making her grief the most important element of that family\u2019s life. They\u2019re all grieving and she needs to get over herself.", "And I have for sure laughed at things my parents have said that I didn\u2019t find funny just because it made me uncomfortable and I didn\u2019t want to deal with it, but knew that was what was expected of me.", "yeah, the man should suck it up and focus on taking care of his poor, sensitive woman, as the rules of the patriarchy state lol\n\nsounds like his wife hurt him too ngl", "I\u2019d have to agree with you here. It\u2019s like \u201cmy grieving process involves slapping people indiscriminately in the face\u201d\u2026is that ok? Of course not. Dude needs to have some consideration.", "Making that joke was obviously a mistake, but I don't get the Impression he was trying to hurt her so I don't think it makes him TA. Point taken though, I get what you're saying.\n\nThe incompatible comment wasn't specific to the joke though, it was a general comment on their situation (which informs how the joke might have slipped out). He wants to talk about their son, she does not want to talk about their son. It sounds like she is generally accommodated on that, as \"we talk about everything except our son.\" Everybody needs to grieve their own way (I'm not criticizing the wife for her grief process), but that is pretty much the definition of incompatibility.", ">Obviously it would be better if they could talk about their son together, but their current styles are incompatible.\n\nSo, why does her style win? Because you find it more acceptable, so screw the father? Why does she get to force him to endure the erasure of his child, but the moment she's forced to endure anything, he's a bad guy?", "That is a red herring and you know it. She could talk about her son 24/7 and still be devastated by OP's \"joke\". Shame on you.", "Probably not healthy but him cracking jokes about it as a solution to her unhealthy grieving doesn\u2019t help", ">she needs to get over herself\n\nShe lost a child **five months ago.** Grief over a lost child never goes away, but it\u2019s been less than a year and those feelings are likely still very raw. \n\nJesus Christ some people are heartless.", "And after all that she will likely still be put off by her husband joking about their sons death.", "Reminds me of a podcast Pamela Anderson was on where she laughed about Tommy secretly drugging her with Molly when they got married in Mexico and the hosts laughing but you can tell they were ultra uncomfortable and had a sidebar where they\u2019re like yeahhh so that was uncool but good for you for handling it humor\u2026", "In part because it's impossible for their styles to fully mesh, hence calling it incompatible. There is no win-win here. I think \"erasure\" is a harsh term for not wanting to talk about him yet just a few months after his death. OP didn't say she never says his name or removed all his pictures. It takes time for some people to be able to discuss a serious death. That isn't erasure. \n\nSecondly, she \"wins\" because his right to grieve ends at her right to grieve. His style directly bulldozes over hers. She isn't ready. Forcing her to be ready and to jump straight to sick jokes is not going to help either of them because it could make her resent him. See above, where she can't even speak to him. Again, I think a compromise where he asks for a time where they can talk about their son in a different way together is one thing (family therapy might be a great place). But shoving morbid jokes at her is not the way. She has a right not to have to hear that.\n\nI don't think he's a bad guy. He just isn't respecting her feelings.", "He's not just bottling up a joke. \n\nHe's literally not allowed to speak about his son at all around her.", "OP says the wife doesn't even speak about the kid at all. \n\nSo OP seems to have to keep his mouth shut most of the time about the mere existence of the kid. Because the wife won't even speak at all. So you think he's horrible for an occasional joke, which I'm inferring is a way to let off the pressure valve of having to tip toe around the wife constantly on this issue? That he can't even acknowledge his own son at all ever in front of her?\n\nYeah nah.", ">His style directly bulldozes over hers.\n\nHer style also directly bulldozes over his. Why is that fine?", ">So you think he's horrible for an occasional joke\n\nNo. Stop putting words in my mouth. I set out what I think is reasonable and unreasonable with regards to compromising over their different styles/needs when grieving.\n\n>That he can't even acknowledge his own son at all ever in front of her?\n\nDid you not read what I wrote? I specifically said that it's reasonable for the OP to reach a compromise with his wife over that, ie to be able to talk to her about it.", "I mean, his style seems to involve making jokes about a subject she's too upset about to even discuss. She just wants to be left alone to grieve in peace. She's 'bulldozing' over nobody.", "Again because it literally isn't possible for both of them to get exactly what they want here. They are at a painful impasse. But I say his style bulldozes over hers because it would force her to do things she isn't ready for. You can ask people for what you want and you can tell them your needs, but they aren't obligated to do it. The wife has made it extremely clear she isn't ready to talk about her loss, let alone in the way OP wants to. She isn't forcing him to do anything. She just doesn't want him to talk like that *with her*. She's allowed that boundary. He can either respect it & wait for her, ask for couple's therapy or leave the relationship, but since he says they are otherwise close, that would be a heartbreaking conclusion. But demanding she listen to jokes she's clearly deeply hurt by is not respectful and yes, is being an ass.\n\nI don't have anything else to say about this. Their needs are, once again, incompatible.", "I think it is enough to say that their needs are incompatible without assigning one more validity than the other."]}
