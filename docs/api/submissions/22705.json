You know that's what will happen.", "OPs sister is obviously very immature. But I have hope that she will get hungry enough to get her lazy butt to the store! Lol.", "She'll just wait out the OP. OP doesn't sound like someone who would needlessly suffer just to prove a dumb point. She'll take charge and get the shopping done, and that's what sister will rely on.", "You're probably right.

You\u2019re going to have to lock it away. Or kick her out. Or move out yourself. One of those. Because it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s interested in changing her behaviour.", "NTA. She is a grown ass adult she can get to the store and buy her own food.", "NTA get a mini fridge in your room.", "NTA Your sister is a parasite in that she is taking and doing nothing in return. Set the boundaries and make her starve. Nothing teaches better than hunger. if she takes from another girl you have room to force her to leave. Sister or not shes disrespectful and rude."]}
