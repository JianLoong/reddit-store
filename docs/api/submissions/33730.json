Sorry for any spelling mistakes in advance.\n\nI used to be very social when I was younger but people change. Around middle school, I started to retreat more from social interactions. In general, I tend to be shy until someone speaks to me first. As a part of growing up and maturing I started seeing my parents flaws in 4k HD. There are many things they say that make my blood boil, for example, racist comments. They're significantly older than the parents of my other friends so the age gap is big, and their mindset is far behind. I don't speak up because speaking up would only strain our relationship more. I also have an issue with a specific sound my step dad constantly makes that is like nails on a chalkboard for me. These 2 reasons alone make it impossible for me to be around them without having headphones in blasting music. I've cried over how frustrated hearing that noise makes me and even after I've brought it up to him it's still bothersome.\n\nOne issue is that since I don't like hanging around old people I'm not the happiest when my mother drags me to a party or gathering with her friends. I prefer to relax at home and be on my phone. This lead my mom to think im antisocial because I spend too much time on my phone but it's just because I don't like the people she forces me to be around. When I'm around people I like I don't even check my phone for hours on end. When there are visitors my step dad is around which equals hearing that noise and getting irritated. I have to blast music in my ears around guests like some rude idiot. It doesn't help that I have a rbf so I look constantly pissed. My mother today gave me a speech about how I'm the problem and how I need to fix my attitude. Her points were that my phone is my entire life, I'm only antisocial around my family and I shouldnt be that way because my family will always care for me the most. I won't deny I give attitude sometimes but it's when doing things I don't like doing. My attitude is just that of a teenager.\n\nI physically can't be around them without blasting my ears out and nobody can hold a conversation while listening to songs at max volume. My major point is that if they weren't my parents I wouldn't want anything to do with them. Them raising me is about all we have in common. Let me know if I'm wrong and I'll fix my attitude.", "created_utc": 1703570493, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r1d8t/aita_for_not_being_social_around_my_family/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I believe I could be the asshole because I can see how my attitude is gloomy and can come off as rude. I can see my parents point of view in saying that I shouldn't be so negative so I am rethinking whether I'm in the wrong or not.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You are a typical teenager. There is nothing wrong with you pulling away from your parents. That is part of growing up. I would let your step-dad know again about the sound, nicely.  Then let mom know that you are in a space right now and you need to just not hang with your family so much. It is hard, but you are becoming an adult, so it is time to speak to mom and step dad like one. Try not to get an attitude and keep your cool, just be honest and let them know you love them always.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This sounds like high-key drama to me, and it certainly sounds like you have a bad attitude."]}
