I have brain mets and things aren't looking too good.  I am taking care of my affair and estate planning when this happened.\n\nI am single.  I have no kids and no long term relationships.  My parents died when I was young and the only surviving family I have are my aunt/uncle, two sisters and their kids.\n\nI am pretty well off.  I started in construction and have a very successful construction business.  I am leaving pretty much everything split between my family.\n\nI split a part of the estate to my aunt and uncle who are both in their late 70s.  They don;t have any kids and I would like to leave something for them to live comfortably.\n\nThe remaing money I have split equally between my sisters and their kids (4 in total).  My sisters are in their late 40s.  Given our age difference and the early death of our parents, our relationship was a mix of sister/brother and sister/father.  I was doing a lot of things our parents would do when they were growing up.  I am very close to them.\n\nThe problem my BILs had was the way I structured the money.  I have the money invested in a long standing trust fund.  All 6 of them will receive a $1 for every $1 they earn.  This would essentially double their income.  Any remaining money will be available to them after they reach 65 years of age.  They also have the option to not use any money and let the investements continue till they retire.  Alternatively, if they don't work, they will get no money till they are 65 years old.\n\nMy neices and nephews have either started working or are in their final year of college.\n\nMy reasoning is that I want them to be self sufficient.  I don't want them to rely on this money or get lost in the sudden influx of wealth.\n\nI had a recent sit down with the family to explain things.  I didn't want to leave any bitter feeling or cause fights over money after my death.  Everyone seemed pretty accepting until I got a bunch of angry calls and message from my brother in laws.  Both of them were calling me a control freak trying to tell their kids and wives how to live their lives.\n\nI am a bit shocked.  I didn't really have such an intention.  Am I being a controlling asshole?\n\nEdit 1: To clarify, I am leaving absolutely nothing for both brother in laws.  Only for 8 people (2 sisters, 4 nephew/neices, 1 aunt, 1 uncle)\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for all the wishes and suggestions.  I would like to clarify a few points\n\n\\- I paid for a large chunk of my neice/nephews education expenses.  I have also offered to pay for any additional schooling, but they are not interested in that.  Two of them have already finished college and are working, the other two are in their final year.\n\n\\- My sisters are well off financially and make close to $100 K a year, they don't need the extra money.\n\n\\- I have provisions to pay for health care expenses and insurance deductibles if needed\n\n\\- In the event anyone dies before the age of 65, their portion gets donated to two charities.  One for for fire fighters with disability and another for veterans.  My two cousins (uncle/aunt's kids) both died in the line of duty of those professions.  I was pretty close to them\n\n\\- My Sisters and Nephews/Nieces do no have any issues with this.  They are just grateful and more focused on supporting me.", "created_utc": 1670817368, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjm5yv/aita_for_the_way_i_made_my_will/", "score": 4266, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that both BILs sent you nastygrams makes me question thier actual intentions", "NTA. It's your money and you can structure it however you want.

What you choose to do with your money after you pass is up to you. Your BILs sound greedy.\n\nBut, to play devil's advocate for a moment, I would also like to point out that this means the more they're financially struggling, the less they'll get. \n\nTake 2020 for an example, a lot of people lost their jobs due to something they had no control over. Not working isn't always an indication of laziness.

Does your will have conditions where they will receive money as long as they are married to your sisters?", "NTA and don't you change a thing! You've protected your sisters in the best way possible because these two men just showed a nasty, greedy side of themselves. If ever a divorce happens, they won't get half. They also won't have the opportunity to blow all of your sisters' inheritance or con the kids out of any of their inheritance. They literally can't touch it and they are not happy.

First of all, it's your money that you earned so what gives them the right to tell you what to do with it? Also it's reasonable to want them to be self-sufficient. I've seen what it does to people to be handed everything they need just like that. You're helping out BILs kids big time. People tend to show their true colors when the will comes out. I would maybe check on your sisters and make sure everything is okay at home. The entitlement from their spouses is kind of concerning.", "NTA.

My grandfather did something similar, promising to leave our inheritances in trusts for us to use on specific things, rather than just giving it to us. It's a nice thought, but it seriously comes off as controlling and a little condescending. It's your money, and you have the right to do whatever you want with it, but think about the message you're sending your family when you do this: They're immature and need you to manage their money and their lives, and can't be trusted to make those decisions for themselves.", "NAH.  It\u2019s your money, but I think this is ill-considered.  Do it if you want, but let\u2019s admit you are encouraging a certain life plan for them.  Just like parents who will only pay for STEM degrees, they have the option to not take your money at all, but most would consider the parent\u2019s move very manipulative and life is much harder if the people you say you care about don\u2019t submit to your dead wishes.  Why not a graded income?  Like an additional thousand dollars every year after your death, with bonuses each decade or something?\n\nI reject the idea that a person\u2019s value is in any way related to their income.  So if kid 1 goes into teaching and earns $30000 a year in a job that also allows them to fulfill their childrearing needs in the summer and breaks, they deserves less than kid 2 who got a job as mid level manager earning $100000 with no family, no debt, and no extraneous obligations.  You are literally rewarding them more for struggling less.  The kid who becomes a nurse definitely deserves less than the one who creates computer code.\n\nWhat if they get in a bad car accident and can\u2019t work?\n\nWhat if they want to retire before age 65?\n\nWhat if they die at 48?\n\nWhat if we go into a big recession and they are laid off next year with no income?\n\nWhat if they choose to be a stay at home parent?\n\nWhat if your aunt and uncle need extra care and someone in the family takes off work to help them?\n\nWhat if they marry someone who works overseas and they can\u2019t get a work permit?\n\nWhat if large parts of their compensation is benefits like free daycare or room and board so they don\u2019t pull as large as income?", "YTA You're putting a work condition on receiving funds for 40 plus year old people?

I would recommend one small change though. Make it so that they can have enough dispersed to cover tuition and on campus living costs, or some of their means to cover housing and books, for the nieces and nephews. It\u2019s pretty difficult to make enough money to cover college costs and attend school full time, especially as those costs have skyrocketed. It would be a better use of your money for them not to have to take out loans and it would give them a lot more options for schooling in the long run. As someone who has disabling injuries caused by a drunk driver who hit me, it might be reasonable to create a disability clause, at least for the kids, the 40-something siblings should be fine in that situation since they\u2019re married and well into careers presumably with disability insurance etc.  \nThose are the only things I\u2019m thinking you might have overlooked. Talk to your attorney again about how to structure clauses that cover college or tech school costs and make allowances that one or more might want to attend graduate school too. Personally, I\u2019d rather see them get a good start and get into the careers they want because they had that support through school than having them take any job they hate and count on the trust payments doubling their income.", "NTA. So it is ok for your BIL to tell you how to live your life and structure your will but you are not allowed to do whatever you want with YOUR OWN MONEY? Yeah, no doesn't work that way. BILs need to back the fuck off. It is your hard earned money and your can do whatever you want with it. The way you structed your will is absolutely fantastic because you are ensuring your siblings and their kids will have a comfortable life while not being useless and lazy on your dime. You are giving them a great incentive to actually succeed because the more they earn the more they will get from your estate. This is brilliant! I am truly sorry about your prognosis and I wish you the best for the time you still have, enjoy it with the people who care about you and not about your money.", "NTA, this is actually a brilliant way to set up an inheritance. \n\nYour BILs can just go stuck lemons,  they aren't receiving anything so it's none of their business.  They are probably just annoyed that they can't control the money and retire themselves.", "I mean I think 65 is a little late considering neither your parents nor yourself are going to live that long. I do like the idea but it does seem a little complicated so I would talk to a lawyer on how well you could actually enforce it. Other than that I don't see anything wrong with it. It's your own money.", "Agreed.  The BILs shouldn\u2019t have standing to sue the estate because they\u2019re not direct inheritors.  If he\u2019s in the US he should advise the sisters and their kids to each set up a separate financial account in only their name for the money to be deposited.  In most states an inheritance is considered the exclusive property of the inheritor and it cannot be divided in a divorce UNLESS it\u2019s commingled with the spouse\u2019s assets.

My part of the estate goes to her and our nonprofit but is setup in payouts that are similar to yours. If she has future children then they receive a college fund and house fund from my part of the estate and if I am still living at the time I will setup separate trusts for each with the understanding that my daughter will continue. It is also structured that SO will not inherit anything and daughter already has a financial prenup ready lol if something should happen to her then board of trustees takes care of the children but nothing to SO. If they chooses as a couple for partner to SAH then that partner will be paid a salary to do so otherwise everyone works. You are NTA you are smart and fair.

Third, your approach is generally reasonable.  Fourth, any concerns should come from the sisters or their kids.\n\nMight you consider modifying things?  I would consider a few scenarios.  What if the kids wanted to use some of the money for grad school?  What if one of the kids or sisters became totally disabled?  What if the BIL became totally disabled?  What if someone went into hospice?\n\nYou could likely structure something if you choose (for example, if there is a SSDI determination of total disability).\n\nFinally, you aren\u2019t telling anyone how to live their lives.  Anybody can simply decline their inheritance.  Anybody can wait until 65.  Anybody can draw down dollar for dollar.  You are creating an incentive for everyone to keep working.

I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone.  \n\nIf that - god forbid - happens to your family members and they are unable to work, they\u2019d be surviving on SSDI.  Which is not a livable income.  Even doubled it would serious limit their lives - especially because they\u2019d have higher medical needs and could need adaptive gear. \n\nJust saying: consider building in a disability clause, which could also cover maternity costs for a year as others have suggested.  \n\nNo one ever thinks about becoming disabled because no one wants to think about it.  So no one is set up to live comfortably if/when it happens.  I know I wasn\u2019t.  \ud83d\ude22\n\nBTW:  I also had to hire multiple lawyers and sue in federal court to collect disability benefits.  I was without any income for nearly 3 years AND had lawyer fees.  It is GRIM.

They'll save a LOT of money by using that to buy a house rather than rent for years.

You're sadly aware that not everyone makes it to 65. Yeah that's the normal age for retirement but what 65 year old really wants to go do things, have new experiences, most of the time they just feel too old, especially after working all their lives.. 55 is still young enough to really enjoy life, going places doing things that they normally couldn't afford or would feel guilty spending the money on. My mother is 58, my dad is 61, 5 years ago if we could have afforded it my parents would have loved to travel, and have those new experiences. My dad definitely feels too old, the amount he has aged in the last 5 years really blows my mind..

I.e. if they end up unable to work, they should still be able to draw from the inheritance to cover living expenses/medical expenses.", "Obviously not the OP, but....\n\n1. The trust will have an executor. They are the ones to make calls in situations like you're describing. However, OP said very specifically they get a dollar for every dollar they ***earn***. The executor will decide if a \"loan\" from a friend constitutes \"earning\" that money. What OP really needs  is an executor he can trust. \n2. If the beneficiary that becomes handicapped and cannot work they can apply for disability benefits. I would think that those benefits would be considered \"earned\" by the executor, and would therefore \"count\" to be doubled. They \"earned\" that income by being disabled. \n3. OP also said that they can either take the money or leave it to grow until they turn 65. If someone is making a large enough income that they don't need the help, surely they would be smart enough to leave the funds for retirement. As for someone making less income, even if they're earning $20k a year at their job where they're working diligently, they will double their income to $40k a year. Which may not sound like a ton to some people, but the person only earning $20k will probably feel like it's a pretty good deal. You could live comfortably on $40k a year, assuming you're single and have no dependents. \n\nI think OP's plan is a good one, and it all hinges on the executor. I have no doubt that there are contingencies in place where an executor can decide to give them more money for things like a down payment on a house or something, but it has to be requested, and the executor has to make that decision. Or, OP doesn't really care to help them purchase a home, and instead want to make sure that they are will cared for when they're ready to retire. You can't try to keep control of your family from the grave. You put the contingencies in place as best you can, then you tell yourself \"welp, I'm not going to be here to watch it all burn, I hope they make good choices\" and you live with your decision until.... well, until you don't.", "I read in a further down comment too that he already helped pay for all the kids colleges so the BIL\u2019s have already been benefiting from his wealth and getting a break.

There are disability insurance policies, most commonly offered by employers as part of a benefit package.   These are not typically offered to hourly employees or lower-paid work.  \n\nEmployer-based disability policies are governed by federal ERISA law which - surprise, surprise- allows those insurers to prey on disabled people and deny coverage for any reason or no reason at all.   Individual federal lawsuits are routinely required to \u2018win\u2019 one\u2019s benefits, and the insurers are ruthless about trying to deny. \n\nIt another epic failing of America\u2019s \u201cfree market capitalism\u201d.

This pretty much invalidates everything you mentioned: he's trying to improve their lives, not maintain the status quo \"well they could become financially ruined without his help so why not allow it to happen with his help\". \nI feel like this trust idea is flawed because of this. Maybe a minimum yearly payout would help? If someone can't work for a few months or a year due to circumstances beyond their control it's financially ruining. Why not mitigate that? (I agree that if it's by choice that's something the person should be responsible for, but you can't easily separate out the circumstances like that. I just feel like if I set up a trust like this for my family, I wouldn't want them SOL due to becoming disabled)", "It's the \"what ifs\" that make this setup contentious. Basically they can be super comfortable if they work until retirement, then get a luxurious retirement, but there is no safety net for the unexpected, and no initial lump sum to clear high-interest debts like credit cards or put a dent in student loans. It reads like the BILs are AHs for being focused on major life upgrades (new house, car, vacations, early retirement, etc.), but if it's about the safety net then I agree with their concerns.\n\nWhat if someone has a huge medical bill from a car accident? What if one/both of them suffers a long-term health problem that means they can't work? What if their entire field dies and they have nothing to fall back on? What if their passion is volunteering, and thus has no income to match? \n\nTo answer your question directly: if OP wasn't dying, the family would be able to turn to him if something bad happens. OP may or may not provide financial support in that case, but if he's alive to make that decision that's very different than if the money is \"theirs\" but they can't touch it if/when it's desperately needed.", "I'd like to point out that OP made this post to ask strangers for their opinion on this topic so please don't villainize commenters for simply complying and giving their opinion.", ">What happens if let\u2019s say one of them gets cancer, but are unable to afford the treatment. \n\nYep, this type of thing happens and sucks.

It's very odd to me to call someone an AH for solving some problems even if not solving all of them. \n\n>It\u2019s your money, so leave it how they want. But personally I think your system of rewarding the richer people is does kind of make you TA here. \n\nThe richer people are not rewarded and do not get any additional money.

If they\u2019ve been grossly irresponsible in the past, it could be justified, but you\u2019ve given no indication of that.\n\nThere are so many reasons someone might not be able to work, and you simply can\u2019t account for all of them.

Congrats on the new kid, many happy returns, enjoy having zero income.\n\nAlso - what about retirement? Aging. I\u2019m assuming this trust is meant to last a long, long time.

What if the spouse already makes more than double what the beneficiary would make? Some people simply are not meant to be stay at home parents as well. It takes away the choice for the beneficiary if they want to benefit before 65. It\u2019s fair to not want them to mooch off the inheritance without contributing to the world, but tying the amount distributed before 65 to the dollar amount earned invalidates the many people who provide unpaid labor for the betterment of their family and society. OP wants them to pursue their passions, but they will only get any assistance to do so before 65 if that passion provides an income.
