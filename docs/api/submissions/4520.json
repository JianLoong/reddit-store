I have brain mets and things aren't looking too good.  I am taking care of my affair and estate planning when this happened.\n\nI am single.  I have no kids and no long term relationships.  My parents died when I was young and the only surviving family I have are my aunt/uncle, two sisters and their kids.\n\nI am pretty well off.  I started in construction and have a very successful construction business.  I am leaving pretty much everything split between my family.\n\nI split a part of the estate to my aunt and uncle who are both in their late 70s.  They don;t have any kids and I would like to leave something for them to live comfortably.\n\nThe remaing money I have split equally between my sisters and their kids (4 in total).  My sisters are in their late 40s.  Given our age difference and the early death of our parents, our relationship was a mix of sister/brother and sister/father.  I was doing a lot of things our parents would do when they were growing up.  I am very close to them.\n\nThe problem my BILs had was the way I structured the money.  I have the money invested in a long standing trust fund.  All 6 of them will receive a $1 for every $1 they earn.  This would essentially double their income.  Any remaining money will be available to them after they reach 65 years of age.  They also have the option to not use any money and let the investements continue till they retire.  Alternatively, if they don't work, they will get no money till they are 65 years old.\n\nMy neices and nephews have either started working or are in their final year of college.\n\nMy reasoning is that I want them to be self sufficient.  I don't want them to rely on this money or get lost in the sudden influx of wealth.\n\nI had a recent sit down with the family to explain things.  I didn't want to leave any bitter feeling or cause fights over money after my death.  Everyone seemed pretty accepting until I got a bunch of angry calls and message from my brother in laws.  Both of them were calling me a control freak trying to tell their kids and wives how to live their lives.\n\nI am a bit shocked.  I didn't really have such an intention.  Am I being a controlling asshole?\n\nEdit 1: To clarify, I am leaving absolutely nothing for both brother in laws.

So yeah NTA", "It\u2019s pretty much impossible to be TA when you\u2019re building a will because you\u2019re dying, but this idea is pretty cool honestly.

The fact that both BILs sent you nastygrams makes me question thier actual intentions", "NTA. It's your money and you can structure it however you want. Sounds like the BILs are just mad they won't get to blow through the money. Tell them the alternative is for you to leave EVERYTHING to the aunt/ uncle so the BILs need to straighten up.", "NTA. What you choose to do with your money after you pass is up to you. Your BILs sound greedy.\n\nBut, to play devil's advocate for a moment, I would also like to point out that this means the more they're financially struggling, the less they'll get. \n\nTake 2020 for an example, a lot of people lost their jobs due to something they had no control over. Not working isn't always an indication of laziness.

Does your will have conditions where they will receive money as long as they are married to your sisters?", "NTA and don't you change a thing! You've protected your sisters in the best way possible because these two men just showed a nasty, greedy side of themselves. If ever a divorce happens, they won't get half. They also won't have the opportunity to blow all of your sisters' inheritance or con the kids out of any of their inheritance. They literally can't touch it and they are not happy. You've made a good choice.

First of all, it's your money that you earned so what gives them the right to tell you what to do with it? Also it's reasonable to want them to be self-sufficient. I've seen what it does to people to be handed everything they need just like that. You're helping out BILs kids big time. People tend to show their true colors when the will comes out. I would maybe check on your sisters and make sure everything is okay at home. The entitlement from their spouses is kind of concerning.", "NTA.

I would wager you BILs just want your money and probably are the ones wanting to not work.", "NTA.

My grandfather did something similar, promising to leave our inheritances in trusts for us to use on specific things, rather than just giving it to us. It's a nice thought, but it seriously comes off as controlling and a little condescending. It's your money, and you have the right to do whatever you want with it, but think about the message you're sending your family when you do this: They're immature and need you to manage their money and their lives, and can't be trusted to make those decisions for themselves.", "NAH.  It\u2019s your money, but I think this is ill-considered.  Do it if you want, but let\u2019s admit you are encouraging a certain life plan for them.  Just like parents who will only pay for STEM degrees, they have the option to not take your money at all, but most would consider the parent\u2019s move very manipulative and life is much harder if the people you say you care about don\u2019t submit to your dead wishes.  Why not a graded income?  Like an additional thousand dollars every year after your death, with bonuses each decade or something?\n\nI reject the idea that a person\u2019s value is in any way related to their income.  So if kid 1 goes into teaching and earns $30000 a year in a job that also allows them to fulfill their childrearing needs in the summer and breaks, they deserves less than kid 2 who got a job as mid level manager earning $100000 with no family, no debt, and no extraneous obligations.  You are literally rewarding them more for struggling less.  The kid who becomes a nurse definitely deserves less than the one who creates computer code.\n\nWhat if they get in a bad car accident and can\u2019t work?\n\nWhat if they want to retire before age 65?\n\nWhat if they die at 48?\n\nWhat if we go into a big recession and they are laid off next year with no income?\n\nWhat if they choose to be a stay at home parent?\n\nWhat if your aunt and uncle need extra care and someone in the family takes off work to help them?\n\nWhat if they marry someone who works overseas and they can\u2019t get a work permit?\n\nWhat if large parts of their compensation is benefits like free daycare or room and board so they don\u2019t pull as large as income?", "YTA You're putting a work condition on receiving funds for 40 plus year old people?

Does the money get distributed last man standing style?\n\nYeah its your money, but tbh, i wouldnt fo that, like, waiting all life to get a large sum of money is horrible, they will just remmember you the wrong way.", "NTA it\u2019s your money and your decision. I would recommend one small change though. Make it so that they can have enough dispersed to cover tuition and on campus living costs, or some of their means to cover housing and books, for the nieces and nephews. It\u2019s pretty difficult to make enough money to cover college costs and attend school full time, especially as those costs have skyrocketed. It would be a better use of your money for them not to have to take out loans and it would give them a lot more options for schooling in the long run. As someone who has disabling injuries caused by a drunk driver who hit me, it might be reasonable to create a disability clause, at least for the kids, the 40-something siblings should be fine in that situation since they\u2019re married and well into careers presumably with disability insurance etc.  \nThose are the only things I\u2019m thinking you might have overlooked. Talk to your attorney again about how to structure clauses that cover college or tech school costs and make allowances that one or more might want to attend graduate school too. Personally, I\u2019d rather see them get a good start and get into the careers they want because they had that support through school than having them take any job they hate and count on the trust payments doubling their income.", "NTA. So it is ok for your BIL to tell you how to live your life and structure your will but you are not allowed to do whatever you want with YOUR OWN MONEY? Yeah, no doesn't work that way. BILs need to back the fuck off. It is your hard earned money and your can do whatever you want with it. The way you structed your will is absolutely fantastic because you are ensuring your siblings and their kids will have a comfortable life while not being useless and lazy on your dime. You are giving them a great incentive to actually succeed because the more they earn the more they will get from your estate. This is brilliant! I am truly sorry about your prognosis and I wish you the best for the time you still have, enjoy it with the people who care about you and not about your money.", "NTA, this is actually a brilliant way to set up an inheritance. \n\nYour BILs can just go stuck lemons,  they aren't receiving anything so it's none of their business.  They are probably just annoyed that they can't control the money and retire themselves.", "I mean I think 65 is a little late considering neither your parents nor yourself are going to live that long. I do like the idea but it does seem a little complicated so I would talk to a lawyer on how well you could actually enforce it. Other than that I don't see anything wrong with it. It's your own money.", "Agreed.  The BILs shouldn\u2019t have standing to sue the estate because they\u2019re not direct inheritors.  If he\u2019s in the US he should advise the sisters and their kids to each set up a separate financial account in only their name for the money to be deposited.  In most states an inheritance is considered the exclusive property of the inheritor and it cannot be divided in a divorce UNLESS it\u2019s commingled with the spouse\u2019s assets.  The kids especially should learn this.", "I agree this setup is actually such a great idea.

I have seen way too many lives ruined because of it.", "The money is equally split between the 4 kids.\n\nFor example, the fund has a total of x dollars.  Some people will get it earlier, some later, but at the end of the day, I am not discriminating between them.  I am leaving them the exact same amount.  Their value is not in their career choice. No one deserves less for their choices.  I am doing this so someone who chooses a career that makes less money, can live the lifestyle of someone who makes more money.

And I don't want that to change.\n\nWe are talking about a lot of money", "There had to be someone.\n\nIt\u2019s not their money.

I was very close to my two cousins as well.\n\nThey are doubling there income, basically getting $50,000+ extra per year.  If there is any money left over, they get it when they retire.  It's like a lottery where you don't get the 100 million right away, they give it to you over time.\n\nAlso by investing it, I can make the same amount of money become a lot more money and leave even more for them.", "2 of them are finished college and working.  The other two are in their last semester.  So it's kind of too late for that.  I already paid for 50% of their tuition, books etc.  Disability is very tricky to set up or so my lawyer says", "These moments are why Reddit is the only social media I use. Thanks this is such an informative comment! I appreciate it", "That was my hope.  I don't want their passion to be restricted due to income.", "You might want to revisit the lawyer who helped you draw up the paperwork and see if there's a way to protect your sisters if they ever get divorced.  I've got no idea what the inheritance laws are where you are, but there might be a way to make sure the money doesn't become community property.", "Just to add to this, you're NTA for sure, and you could change nothing and be 100% well within your rights... but do you have something in mind for other times they may not have an income? What if they become medically disabled, or physically injured?

If talking about exceptions.\n\nBut apart from that... Omg, this is amazing setup!! Like really... Doubling their income is not small thing.\n\nI think BILs are angry because they are not getting anything. And if your sisters and their kids would get everything right away, BILs would get more of that money.

I hope that you keep well and do some things for yourself from here on out.", "I understand that but by basing your decision on that fear you are telling your loved ones that they aren\u2019t respected enough to handle their financial decisions. Unless your family has proven to be outrageously reckless with money this worry is based entirely in fear and not on your experience with them (not some other people and their poor choices). Is your fear/principle more important to you than your family benefiting from your gift without resentment?", "Unless it happens next year, or they are forced into a position where they can\u2019t work.\n\nThe ones who make less money are more likely to take it out earlier so their share is less overall than those who can afford to leave it to grow.  You literally just spelled out how those who are paid more won\u2019t touch the principal. You also encourage them to spend that money like they are earning twice their salary while also saying they should take it and save it in case they need a emergency fund.  So they should take the money and use it, but also take the money from your savings and put it in their savings each year, but also they should leave it in your trust until they are 65?  What do you actually expect to happen?\n\nI mean, it is your money and that\u2019s capitalism\u2026 but man are you setting up this family for a microcosm of the worst of our society.  I am sure they will accept your terms if they have to, and be better off for doing so, but this isn\u2019t as simple as you seem to think when hit with actual practicalities.  I agree.  Ideally, they shouldn\u2019t need it, but life intervenes.  You yourself are dying before 65.", "But that won't help them in the case of an unexpected disability that prevents them from working. And I'm not positive, but having that nest egg waiting for them might get in the way of them accessing government benefits that they'd otherwise be entitled to, even though they can't actually use those funds. \n\nIf you want them to not have a large lump sum right away, why not simply have the trust set up to dispurse a set amount each month, as a guaranteed income? (UBI for the win!) That way they still have the option to potentially follow their dreams of a less lucrative career without risking not being able to support themselves.

And then the remainder once they are 65.", "NTA. I think the husbands were counting on the money more than your sisters with the way they're acting.

If she has future children then they receive a college fund and house fund from my part of the estate and if I am still living at the time I will setup separate trusts for each with the understanding that my daughter will continue. It is also structured that SO will not inherit anything and daughter already has a financial prenup ready lol if something should happen to her then board of trustees takes care of the children but nothing to SO.

What if the kids wanted to use some of the money for grad school?  What if one of the kids or sisters became totally disabled?  What if the BIL became totally disabled?  What if someone went into hospice?\n\nYou could likely structure something if you choose (for example, if there is a SSDI determination of total disability).\n\nFinally, you aren\u2019t telling anyone how to live their lives.  Anybody can simply decline their inheritance.  Anybody can wait until 65.  Anybody can draw down dollar for dollar.  You are creating an incentive for everyone to keep working.

I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone.  \n\nIf that - god forbid - happens to your family members and they are unable to work, they\u2019d be surviving on SSDI.  Which is not a livable income.  Even doubled it would serious limit their lives - especially because they\u2019d have higher medical needs and could need adaptive gear. \n\nJust saying: consider building in a disability clause, which could also cover maternity costs for a year as others have suggested.  \n\nNo one ever thinks about becoming disabled because no one wants to think about it.  So no one is set up to live comfortably if/when it happens.  I know I wasn\u2019t.  \ud83d\ude22\n\nBTW:  I also had to hire multiple lawyers and sue in federal court to collect disability benefits.  I was without any income for nearly 3 years AND had lawyer fees.  It is GRIM.

Early 20's is old enough to be on your own in the world, and it's old enough to manage your own money.\n\nBesides that, there are some very significant advantages to having that money now vs when they're 65. They'll save a LOT of money by using that to buy a house rather than rent for years. And now is really the only time they'll be free of responsibilities and able to take a few months to travel; that's  lot harder to do once you have a job and a family.

You're sadly aware that not everyone makes it to 65. Yeah that's the normal age for retirement but what 65 year old really wants to go do things, have new experiences, most of the time they just feel too old, especially after working all their lives.. 55 is still young enough to really enjoy life, going places doing things that they normally couldn't afford or would feel guilty spending the money on. My mother is 58, my dad is 61, 5 years ago if we could have afforded it my parents would have loved to travel, and have those new experiences. My dad definitely feels too old, the amount he has aged in the last 5 years really blows my mind.. They never actually took a honeymoon and their anniversary trips are to a fancy bed and breakfast that is still inside our town.

Locking your money away limits its usefulness to them.", "I think you are being too controlling, not enough to be the AH because you don't technically have to give them anything and the BILs are the true AH.  \nSeems like your sisters are doing fine so if they want to retire early and just wait until 65 for their money that's their choice.   \nBut what if your nibblings choose to take an alternative path. Maybe they want to join the Peace Corp for a couple years, or decide to be a stay at home parent, or care for another sick relative, or pursue an advanced degree, or join a comune. I think the trustee should have some more discretion to be able to pay out something if they aren't just sitting on the asses. There are ways to be a contributing member of society without earning a wage (or a high wage), and they shouldn't be punished for that. Also what if they choose a more noble, but lower paid position, should they be punished for that relative to their siblings/cousins. \n \nConsider two want to be teachers. That's always been their goal. You are incentivising them to pursue a position at a high paying district versus where their skills are most needed. Maybe one chooses to take a 40k position at a failing school where help is desperately needed and is their true passion. And one is making 80k at a private school. It seems to me with your current setup you are incentivising making money for moneys sake versus incentivising them to go out and benefit society as best they can. This seems counter to what you are really trying to do by not making them into \"trust fund kids.\"  \n\nI would encourage you to find some middle ground, maybe including a floor and ceiling on yearly disbursements. Or paying out some multiple of minimum wage for hours worked and time volunteered. Maybe phasing out the match after a certain dollar amount like from 75-150k the match is only half. \n\nFinal verdict is NTA, but you can do better than your current setup.", "Soft YTA.  I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve thought this all out to its logical conclusion and it\u2019s actually going to be far more restricting than you intend.  If it were me, I\u2019d gift the money with no strings attached to the aunt and uncle and set up trust accounts for the others.  If you truly respect and love these people, you need to trust in their integrity and common sense.  Otherwise, give it to charity.", "Came here to say the same. Honestly never knew it was an option\n\nYour will, your choice", "Great advice ..OP please mention this to sisters and nieces/nephews or honestly just set it up separately with it in each of their names only so it doesn\u2019t cause any problems in the sisters marriages(if you haven\u2019t already). You could have your lawyer explain this to them each privately as well when he is reading of the will so they know why you did it this way and they understand. You don\u2019t want them BILs to get their hands on the money if they divorce(it\u2019s just an hypothetical people) than they will be able to leave with something that wasn\u2019t giving to them or theirs! Also in the in unexpected death of one of the sisters(God forbid) their inheritance goes only to their kid(s), maybe have your lawyer redo it to include that(I am not one to judge but your BILs sound greedy and we know what can happen when people get too greedy again god forbid but extra protection). And your nieces/nephews should be protected too if they were to ever get married and it didn\u2019t work out! \n\nAlso I understand what some or saying about helping your nieces/nephews pay for college or giving them each a separate amount to have \u201cjust because\u201d(medical expenses, housing etc) So you could set that up and make it a specific amount for them to have in case of emergency or whatever for each of them and college tuition for niece/nephews and keep MOST of it how you have it. $1 added for every $1 earned because it\u2019s actually a good idea and does help them later in life. If your nieces/nephews decide not to go to college but get a trade instead leave room for that so they can pay for trade school and than the rest goes back with the other money($1 added for every $1 earned) and if they decide to do neither after 5 years it all go back with the rest. Idk I\u2019m just rambling but these are ideas to have. You probably don\u2019t want to have to change your will and just want to have peace with the time you have left which is understandable. So if you don\u2019t wanna change it don\u2019t but keep and open mind I guess\n\nNTA ..your BILs are probably just upset because they don\u2019t have the chance to spend the wives and kids money how they wanted/how they thought they would be able to.

His mother had died six years previously and he used his inheritance to provide stable housing while he re-learnt how to walk, write, etc. \n\nI'm very sorry you are in poor health.
