I have brain mets and things aren't looking too good.  I am taking care of my affair and estate planning when this happened.\n\nI am single.  I have no kids and no long term relationships.  My parents died when I was young and the only surviving family I have are my aunt/uncle, two sisters and their kids.\n\nI am pretty well off.  I started in construction and have a very successful construction business.  I am leaving pretty much everything split between my family.\n\nI split a part of the estate to my aunt and uncle who are both in their late 70s.  They don;t have any kids and I would like to leave something for them to live comfortably.\n\nThe remaing money I have split equally between my sisters and their kids (4 in total).  My sisters are in their late 40s.  Given our age difference and the early death of our parents, our relationship was a mix of sister/brother and sister/father.  I was doing a lot of things our parents would do when they were growing up.  I am very close to them.\n\nThe problem my BILs had was the way I structured the money.  I have the money invested in a long standing trust fund.  All 6 of them will receive a $1 for every $1 they earn.  This would essentially double their income.  Any remaining money will be available to them after they reach 65 years of age.  They also have the option to not use any money and let the investements continue till they retire.  Alternatively, if they don't work, they will get no money till they are 65 years old.\n\nMy neices and nephews have either started working or are in their final year of college.\n\nMy reasoning is that I want them to be self sufficient.  I don't want them to rely on this money or get lost in the sudden influx of wealth.\n\nI had a recent sit down with the family to explain things.  I didn't want to leave any bitter feeling or cause fights over money after my death.  Everyone seemed pretty accepting until I got a bunch of angry calls and message from my brother in laws.  Both of them were calling me a control freak trying to tell their kids and wives how to live their lives.\n\nI am a bit shocked.  I didn't really have such an intention.  Am I being a controlling asshole?\n\nEdit 1: To clarify, I am leaving absolutely nothing for both brother in laws.  Only for 8 people (2 sisters, 4 nephew/neices, 1 aunt, 1 uncle)", "created_utc": 1670817368, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjm5yv/aita_for_the_way_i_made_my_will/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that both BILs sent you nastygrams makes me question thier actual intentions", "NTA. It's your money and you can structure it however you want.

First of all, it's your money that you earned so what gives them the right to tell you what to do with it? Also it's reasonable to want them to be self-sufficient. I've seen what it does to people to be handed everything they need just like that. You're helping out BILs kids big time. People tend to show their true colors when the will comes out. I would maybe check on your sisters and make sure everything is okay at home. The entitlement from their spouses is kind of concerning.", "NTA.

My grandfather did something similar, promising to leave our inheritances in trusts for us to use on specific things, rather than just giving it to us. It's a nice thought, but it seriously comes off as controlling and a little condescending. It's your money, and you have the right to do whatever you want with it, but think about the message you're sending your family when you do this: They're immature and need you to manage their money and their lives, and can't be trusted to make those decisions for themselves.", "NAH.  It\u2019s your money, but I think this is ill-considered.  Do it if you want, but let\u2019s admit you are encouraging a certain life plan for them.  Just like parents who will only pay for STEM degrees, they have the option to not take your money at all, but most would consider the parent\u2019s move very manipulative and life is much harder if the people you say you care about don\u2019t submit to your dead wishes.  Why not a graded income?  Like an additional thousand dollars every year after your death, with bonuses each decade or something?\n\nI reject the idea that a person\u2019s value is in any way related to their income.  So if kid 1 goes into teaching and earns $30000 a year in a job that also allows them to fulfill their childrearing needs in the summer and breaks, they deserves less than kid 2 who got a job as mid level manager earning $100000 with no family, no debt, and no extraneous obligations.  You are literally rewarding them more for struggling less.  The kid who becomes a nurse definitely deserves less than the one who creates computer code.\n\nWhat if they get in a bad car accident and can\u2019t work?\n\nWhat if they want to retire before age 65?\n\nWhat if they die at 48?\n\nWhat if we go into a big recession and they are laid off next year with no income?\n\nWhat if they choose to be a stay at home parent?\n\nWhat if your aunt and uncle need extra care and someone in the family takes off work to help them?\n\nWhat if they marry someone who works overseas and they can\u2019t get a work permit?\n\nWhat if large parts of their compensation is benefits like free daycare or room and board so they don\u2019t pull as large as income?", "YTA You're putting a work condition on receiving funds for 40 plus year old people?

I would recommend one small change though. Make it so that they can have enough dispersed to cover tuition and on campus living costs, or some of their means to cover housing and books, for the nieces and nephews. It\u2019s pretty difficult to make enough money to cover college costs and attend school full time, especially as those costs have skyrocketed. It would be a better use of your money for them not to have to take out loans and it would give them a lot more options for schooling in the long run. As someone who has disabling injuries caused by a drunk driver who hit me, it might be reasonable to create a disability clause, at least for the kids, the 40-something siblings should be fine in that situation since they\u2019re married and well into careers presumably with disability insurance etc.  \nThose are the only things I\u2019m thinking you might have overlooked. Talk to your attorney again about how to structure clauses that cover college or tech school costs and make allowances that one or more might want to attend graduate school too. Personally, I\u2019d rather see them get a good start and get into the careers they want because they had that support through school than having them take any job they hate and count on the trust payments doubling their income.", "NTA. So it is ok for your BIL to tell you how to live your life and structure your will but you are not allowed to do whatever you want with YOUR OWN MONEY? Yeah, no doesn't work that way. BILs need to back the fuck off. It is your hard earned money and your can do whatever you want with it. The way you structed your will is absolutely fantastic because you are ensuring your siblings and their kids will have a comfortable life while not being useless and lazy on your dime. You are giving them a great incentive to actually succeed because the more they earn the more they will get from your estate. This is brilliant! I am truly sorry about your prognosis and I wish you the best for the time you still have, enjoy it with the people who care about you and not about your money.", "NTA, this is actually a brilliant way to set up an inheritance. \n\nYour BILs can just go stuck lemons,  they aren't receiving anything so it's none of their business.  They are probably just annoyed that they can't control the money and retire themselves.", "I mean I think 65 is a little late considering neither your parents nor yourself are going to live that long. I do like the idea but it does seem a little complicated so I would talk to a lawyer on how well you could actually enforce it. Other than that I don't see anything wrong with it. It's your own money.", "Agreed.  The BILs shouldn\u2019t have standing to sue the estate because they\u2019re not direct inheritors.  If he\u2019s in the US he should advise the sisters and their kids to each set up a separate financial account in only their name for the money to be deposited.  In most states an inheritance is considered the exclusive property of the inheritor and it cannot be divided in a divorce UNLESS it\u2019s commingled with the spouse\u2019s assets.

Some people will get it earlier, some later, but at the end of the day, I am not discriminating between them.  I am leaving them the exact same amount.  Their value is not in their career choice.

And I don't want that to change.\n\nWe are talking about a lot of money", "There had to be someone.\n\nIt\u2019s not their money.

The other two are in their last semester.  So it's kind of too late for that.

Thanks this is such an informative comment! I appreciate it", "That was my hope.  I don't want their passion to be restricted due to income.", "You might want to revisit the lawyer who helped you draw up the paperwork and see if there's a way to protect your sisters if they ever get divorced.

What if they become medically disabled, or physically injured?

If talking about exceptions.\n\nBut apart from that... Omg, this is amazing setup!! Like really... Doubling their income is not small thing.\n\nI think BILs are angry because they are not getting anything. And if your sisters and their kids would get everything right away, BILs would get more of that money.

I hope that you keep well and do some things for yourself from here on out.", "I understand that but by basing your decision on that fear you are telling your loved ones that they aren\u2019t respected enough to handle their financial decisions.

Is your fear/principle more important to you than your family benefiting from your gift without resentment?", "Unless it happens next year, or they are forced into a position where they can\u2019t work.\n\nThe ones who make less money are more likely to take it out earlier so their share is less overall than those who can afford to leave it to grow.  You literally just spelled out how those who are paid more won\u2019t touch the principal. You also encourage them to spend that money like they are earning twice their salary while also saying they should take it and save it in case they need a emergency fund.  So they should take the money and use it, but also take the money from your savings and put it in their savings each year, but also they should leave it in your trust until they are 65?  What do you actually expect to happen?\n\nI mean, it is your money and that\u2019s capitalism\u2026 but man are you setting up this family for a microcosm of the worst of our society.  I am sure they will accept your terms if they have to, and be better off for doing so, but this isn\u2019t as simple as you seem to think when hit with actual practicalities.  I agree.  Ideally, they shouldn\u2019t need it, but life intervenes.  You yourself are dying before 65.", "But that won't help them in the case of an unexpected disability that prevents them from working. And I'm not positive, but having that nest egg waiting for them might get in the way of them accessing government benefits that they'd otherwise be entitled to, even though they can't actually use those funds. \n\nIf you want them to not have a large lump sum right away, why not simply have the trust set up to dispurse a set amount each month, as a guaranteed income? (UBI for the win!) That way they still have the option to potentially follow their dreams of a less lucrative career without risking not being able to support themselves.

And then the remainder once they are 65.", "NTA. I think the husbands were counting on the money more than your sisters with the way they're acting.
