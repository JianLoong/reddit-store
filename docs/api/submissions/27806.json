These rules will apply to all guests, the wedding party, the groom, the venue staff, any vendors and the officiant. No exceptions will be made for age or gender.\n\nAs you are doubtless aware, white is the brides colour. It is not considered good taste to try to outshine a bride on her big day. For this reason, all white items are banned.\n\nNo white is to worn by anyone other than the bride. This includes clothing, accessories, shoes and underwear. After all, we don\u2019t want some sartorial mishap to ruin the start of our lives as a married couple. If you violate this you will be ejected, and we absolutely will be conducting surprise inspections to be sure.\n\nEyeballs are noticeably white, therefore all parties must get scleral tattooing. If you go blind, tough luck. No exceptions will be made, regardless of age, infirmity, religion or any other \u201cexcuse.\u201d Fear of needles is not a good reason not to comply. Suck it up buttercup.\n\nChoose any colour except red or blue or anything too similar to red or blue such as pink, orange, purple, green or black, which, of course, could easily be mistaken for dark blue, as those are the wedding colours. Tattooists will be available on the day for those who were unable to arrange this. Please bring cash as they will not be taking card payments.\n\nElderly persons should dye their hair or shave bald. The same goes for any white/grey facial hair, including eyebrows. Staff will be present with clippers to ensure compliance. The cost of hiring the staff will be split between those who have to be shaved. The same will apply to anyone deemed \u201ctoo blonde\u201d.\n\nTeeth should be removed or in some way dyed or covered. Brightly coloured sports mouth guards are ideal. If you do not comply you will be referred to the specially hired dental staff. If you refuse you will be ejected. Dental work will be at your expense.\n\nIf your skin is too pale the bride and groom will arrange for an intensive course of tanning injections, however these will be at your expense. If you arrive on the day and are deemed too pale a full-body veil will be provided for you.\n\nEveryone should paint their nails to avoid paleness. Colours should be bright or dark, avoiding any of the previously mentioned colours. Males are not exempt. Failure to comply will result in manicure-by-force. You will be billed later.\n\nIf you drive a white car, hire a different one or paint your car. The same goes for silver, cream or light grey, just in case. A car respraying crew will be on site and will examine all cars in the parking lot. They will be under strict instruction to paint any cars that are too \u201cbridal\u201d. This will be at your expense and without consulting you. You have already been warned, you only have yourself to blame.\n\nWe hope you understand that these rules are in place for the well-being of everyone and to avoid confusion, and that you will not find them too onerous to honour us on this most special day.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you at the ceremony. Please remember to bring cash for the bar and don\u2019t forget your wedding gifts. (One gift per person please, from the registry only.)
