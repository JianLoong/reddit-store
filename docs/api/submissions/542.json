Kid, you're 17 and you are one of her children (several times removed, but still).  There are going to be times when you have to be calm, authoritative, and brisk because she will be flipping out over whatever is going on in her head but you need her to take her meds or whatever.  I'm more than old enough to be your mom and I have a hard time doing that.  It should not be expected of you.\n\nMove out, and tell them to find a trained adult who can have a professional relationship with Great-Grandma.  Visit her every Tuesday or something.\n\nOh, and: You absolutely WNBTA if you decide, on those visits, that if she flips out you will smile gently, say, \"I can see you're having one of your tough times, I'll come back another day,\" and *leave.*", "NTA. DO NOT STAY. Your great aunt can figure out another care situation. You deserve a start in life, a good education, and jobs and eventually career you choose. Please don't give your life up. If your great grandmother were thinking straight she wouldn't be asking that of you either. \n\nSorry you lost your great grandpa.", "NTA. Your aunt is just trying to eliminate a problem, namely who _will_ look after your grandmother? Well, it should not be you. You need to go out in the world, get the best education, you possibly can, develop as a person, socialize etc. _AND_ your grandmother will need professional, emphatic care. Not a teenage granddaughter who has been guilted into the job, just because it is a cheap and easy solution for everyone else.", "Caring for a family member, especially an elderly one, is a VERY difficult and arduous task. If you're to 100% committed to it, do not do it. Go live your life. Go to university, get a part time job, look in on your gran every week and have a nice dinner with her. But do NOT put your life n hold/destroy your life to look after her just because people are guilting you into it. She is NOT your responsibility. \n\nNTA", "Please get out of there and get on with your life. No matter who raises us, we are expected to leave home when we become adults, not to stay forever and take care of our caregivers, be they parents or other guardians. Plus, she has been bad for your mental health. All the more reason to go, and the sooner the better.  \nYour great aunt is trying to guilt you because she knows she has to find a caregiver for for your great grandma when you're gone and it would make it easier for her if you stay. Don't let her guilt you. Go!\n\nNTA!", "NTA. Taking care of elderly people is hard work and only one person benefits.\n\nLook into social programming for her. Churches, local govt funded projects, through health insurance to get her the care she needs. \n\nBut she\u2019ll be dead in the next 10-20 years and you will have missed a lot of opportunity to learn, travel, find love, start your own family or career because she is there. \n\nNot saying to shut her in a corner and forget about her, but you will end up making a huge sacrifice that only makes the end of her life easier. But what about the beginning of your life?", "YWNBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LEAVE** to do what you want.

If it is a good deal, why isn't she doing that herself?** Don't listen to that AH - she is lying to you, because she does not want to do it herself.

That is the normal thing: moving out, and having a life of your own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\". Maybe if I stay after 18 it wouldn't be so bad? \" .. It will be bad. You can not imagine how bad. And if you feel guilty now, leaving when you have accepted the caretaker role will be even harder. So: **are you ready to put your life on halt for the next 10-20 years**?
