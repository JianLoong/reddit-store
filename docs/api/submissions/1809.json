Being stupid enough to gift you a piece of jewelry, as a parting love gift....then tell you it was his sister's throwaway?! No. Just no. It can't be compared to an \"heirloom\" because those are highly regarded special pieces, people! And to decieve you and act like it's meaningful when it really was something his sister was going to trash is yucky. \n\nCan you give a piece of jewelry that was going to be trashed as a gift? Yes, this is how...\n\n<on a totally non-special benign day> \"Hey, my sister doesn't wear this anymore and wanted to know if you'd like it?\"\n\nA token of your love and fidelity to each other during a time of distance should not be your sister's throw away. Running to a convenient store and buying a candy necklace is better than that.", "NTA\n\nWas it a nice gesture from him? yeah, sure. But it was also lazy and not meaningful in anyway. It is literally a hand-me-down and not in the heirloom kinda way lol", "Except the symbolism here is \u201cmy sister was going to throw it out\u201d . Idk, it\u2019s ok that it\u2019s regifted, but to say \u201cthis is a symbol of our love\u201d is a stretch imo", "NTA, if it was meant for you then I'm sure you would have no problem wearing it. If it was meant for someone else, it seems very unreasonable for someone to expect you to not only love it but wear it?  \n\n\nA gift is something you specifically pick out for someone, especially if it is your significant other...", "NTA not like he begged his sister for it because you loved it. He just wants more credit for his low effort. You basically got a gift from the goodwill donation. A gift doesn't have to be expensive or anything but if it isn't the effort has to come from somewhere in my book. Presents are about showing you know a person, that you've thought about them, and you think it will bring some happiness.", "NTA I think I read a post somewhere about a boyfriend gifting his gf a handbag from when his mum was clearing out old shoes and handbags from the bottom of her wardrobe. It is something someone might like to use and pass on, rather than throwaway, but thoughtful gift? No, it is not. He didn't take the time to pick something out for you, he just got offered free stuff.", "Did you like the necklace before you found out where it came from?", "NTA\n\nJust because he gave you a gift, it doesn't imply that you must wear it 24/7. A necklace can be worn daily, or for special occasions, but it's up to you to decide when. If he gifted you a pajama, does he expect you to wear it also outside?", "NTA. Maybe he\u2019s feeling insecure about the distance and seeing the necklace on you would be reassuring. But when you give a gift, you don\u2019t get to dictate how the person uses it.", "NAH\n\nYou and him focus on different parts of gift giving. You seem to appreciate something he labored over, he seems to appreciate symbolism. It's important to discuss what you each need for the future.", "This reminds me of several situations where guys propose to their gf with a ring they had bought for their ex and it didnt work out with them...their gf loves the ring but knowing that it was given to someone else they suddenly just dont like it anymore.", "YTA but not for not wearing it. Of course you don't have to wear it daily. But YTA for saying the gift had no meaning. You should appreciate the gift. Obviously, he thought of you and wanted you to have it. Gifts do not have to cost a lot of money.", "Yta if you arent wearing it soley based on how he acquired the gift.", "I mean he got you a piece of jewelry because he thought of you. If it was a family heirloom you wouldn't care, you'd be bragging. YTA and you should apologize", "YTA for telling him the gift wasn't meaningful...  \nYou're not required to wear it, or even like it, but that just sounds mean...", "He is right but so are you. Tell him you don\u2019t want to wear a necklace that was about to be tossed in the trash.", "YTA.  Why does it matter how he got the necklace?", "This is so strange.  If I wore every piece of jewelry I'd ever been gifted, I would look like Mr. T.\n\nESH- Him for thinking you should wear it forever and always, you for saying a gift wasn't meaningful.", "YTA\n\nSo the gift is only worth it if he spends money?? He received something and thought of you. Hopefully he starts thinking about someone else.", "YTA - if it was his mothers, you would be bragging to everyone about it \ud83d\udc80.", "YTA, would his grandmother's engagement ring not be a meaningful gift? A gift is a gift no matter what. You don't have to wear it 24/7 but nor should you have so blatantly insulted his efforts", "YTA for criticizing where the gift came from. Of course you don\u2019t have to wear anything you don\u2019t want to. But it was the \u201cI told him it wasn\u2019t meaningful\u201d that makes my judgement", "INFO: Did you like it when you received it, then changed your mind when you learned he didn't go shopping for it himself?", "YTA", "NAH like yeah he shouldn't have given u someone's trash as a parting gift and its okay you don't want to wear it anymore because it doesn't feel special anymore. \nhowever he clearly cares ab you having the item as well, he noticed when you stopped wearing it", "YTA  it was a gift and he accepted it from his sister with you in mind. You're upset he didn't go spend $$ in a store is the only reason you aren't wearing it? That's childish. Saying it had no meaning was seriously rude on your part", "YTA Who's to say he didn't really love that necklace and his sister knew it so when she decided to get rid of it she offered it to him first. Did she get rid of other jewelry and he only chose that one necklace?\n\nYou say it's not the money spent on a gift but the thoughtfulness, but from your post there's not enough info to see if there was thought. He clearly likes the way the necklace looks on you or he wouldn't have asked why you weren't wearing it.\n\nNo, you don't have to wear it every day.", "NTA for not wearing the necklace, but YTA for telling him it wasn't a meaningful gift. So if he paid your sister for the necklace, would it have been a meaningful gift? What of family heirlooms?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you don't take his feeling into account, if you dismiss his feelings as \"silly\" or \"wrong\", they you will be TA. Not saying that you need to cater to his whims, but that you shouldn't invalidate his feelings about this necklce by ignoring what you've learned about his attachment to it.", "I might get downvoted a bit for this but honestly I think it's a bit of ESH. Was the gift not outstandingly meaningful and was it a bit lazy yes. That being said not all gifts have to have a huge amount of meaning. Now of course he shouldn't expect anything like you wearing it all the time or anything, as it's just piece of jewelry without a huge sentimental value behind it. However, you probably didn't have to respond to why you aren't wearing it, with \"because it's not a meaningful gift\" and could have gone with just something like \"I didn't feel like wearing it today\". All in all I think you're both hung up on putting too many expectations on each other.", "OP obviously doesn\u2019t like that it didn\u2019t come with a price tag attached to it", "Its not about the money its a complete lack of effort, who wants a second hand necklace thats being binned by someone else", "This is not a thoughtful gift at all and has nothing to do with the price of the necklace. OP's boyfriend put no thought into choosing a piece of jewelry to give to his girlfriend. His sister was cleaning out her closet and he presented the necklace to OP as if it were something he picked out for her personally.", "It isn't about the cost. It is about the thought. This was thoughtless. He doesn't get a \"best boyfriend\" award for a hand-me down. He doesn't get to pretend it is a thoughtful gift. The only one who was thoughtful was his sister as she obviously thought OP might want it and offered to her brother to give to her. He gets a thanks - which he got, but all he did was carry it from his sister to his GF.\n\nOP didn't come out and tell him it wasn't thoughtful. He asked her why she wasn't wearing it - which is rude. Once you give a gift, you should not be pressuring someone to wear it. He doesn't get to pretend this is a loving item that should be worn every day as a representation of his love to her and get his nose in a joint when she doesn't wear it. He pushed the issue and she gave him an honest answer.", "Yes. Not all of us like other people's trash", "IF it was a heirloom NOT the trash someone was ditching", "But it literally wasn\u2019t? It\u2019s not like he put a lot of thought into obtaining it.", "IF bf had thought about the necklace that he wanted her to have and search out the necklace of his vision that would be one thing. It would have a lot of the boyfriend in it.\n\nIf bf saw his sister tossing it and thought \"cool necklace, I bet gf would like it\" that would be a different thing. Less thought was put into it, less of boyfriend in it.\n\nThe OPs problem isn't how much the necklace should mean to her, but that she and bf had different levels of attachment to it. I agree with your judgment about OPs past behavior. It does/did matter to her where she got it and that's as valid a feeling as the bf thinking it was a special gift. How OP does or doesn't react to that difference between her and bf is where the OP might by TA in the future.\n\nThere's no right amount of sentiment that should be attached to the necklace, the challenge is dealing with different amounts of sentiment each chooses to attach to it.", "Because it would mean something if it had some kind of significance? This is just some random necklace his sister didn\u2019t want lmao.", "Sounds like she changed her mind when she realized he didn\u2019t actually put any thought into it. If it was a special necklace from his sister, or had some kind of other meaning, it\u2019s different - but it\u2019s literally just a random necklace she was going to discard lmao.", "THIS absolutely. I can't believe all these N T A comments! He saw that his sister was getting rid of it, and thought you would like it. Which you DID, until you found out he hadn't gone out deliberately looking for a gift for you. You say it's not about the money, but that it's \"meaningless\" - and that's a YOU issue. From where I'm sitting, he did something very nice by presenting you with a necklace that you really liked. YOU are now acting ungrateful and it's not a good look.   \n\n\nYTA.", "OP doesn\u2019t like that absolutely zero thought went into the gift, other than \u201coh yeah sure I\u2019ll take it\u201d.", "Plenty of people. Thrift shops and pawn shops are full of other people's throwaways.", "At no point did anyone say he was a good boyfriend or deserving of an award. No one is even saying she has to wear it.", "I mean I guess. But we have no idea if it was trash. It seemed like she wore it prior? I will say he should have said, \"hey my sister was going to get rid of this would you like it?\" Just to make sure everyone was on the same page", "It's still a rude thing to say, whether you think it's meaningful or not.  \nLike I said, you don't have to wear it or like it, but you still have to be nice to your partner... wtf lol", "It's pretty crazy in comments sometimes. I can't imagine behaving like that. Well you didn't BUY it for me so meh doesn't mean a thing. Calling it meaningless. That bit is just awful to me.", "Yeah sure for shopping for yourself, not as a romantic gift though", "But that is the whole point of the post. She said thank you and was gracious. Boyfriend rudely asked why she wasn't wearing it and she told him the truth. He wants a best boyfriend award for the gift and expects her  \"wear it everyday\" - even though his gesture of giving it was essentially meaningless.\n\nShe isn't being ungrateful for giving him an honest response to his very rude question.", "Not being meaningful is an expression-a communication. It isn't rude. How does he do he do better when she does not communicate?", "Why should she wear some random necklace that he got before his sister was going to throw it away all the time? Like, it\u2019s not about the money - it\u2019s about the thought behind it and that\u2019s very evident lmao. He put no thought into it, but hyped it up as a departure gift? A *letter* would have meant more than some necklace he was like \u201cyah that\u2019ll do\u201d about lmao.", "I know, right?! Ungrateful. For me, it also hinges on the fact that she LIKED THE NECKLACE until she found out his sister didn't want it anymore. It was a more-than-acceptable gift until that happened.", "I know loads of people whos engagment rings come for pawn shops. Yeah romantic gifts should not have to be expensive or vaulable.", "There are better and kinder ways for adults to communicate how they feel. :)", "They should at least be thoughtful and not something another woman in your other halves life is just discarding. You can argue all you like but i dont agree that OP should have to beg for bare minimum effort scraps. This isnt a beautiful antique ring its a piece of presumably costume jewellery bought for his sister that was going in the bin. Her response was appropriate - a simple thanks but its never going to be a symbolic special gift that represents their relationship that he was expecting it to be. He was expecting a big sentimental reaction by her wearing it always like an engagement ring for the absolute minimum thought and effort, its not about money as ive said.", "That wasnt your point i was commenting on. You said trift and pawn shops arent place to buy gifts and they are. And you can get much nicer things for better value then you could otherwise. Thats not what happened here. If he asked did she want it as his sis was getting rid fine.", "I personally wouldn\u2019t particularly want a gift from a charity shop no but I appreciate everyone is different. But even picking something out from there wouldve been more thoughtful than what happened. Like its fine, its like giving someone a pair of trainers you dont wear much but hes expecting too much from it and its lame."]}
