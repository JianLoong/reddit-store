Stand firm on your boundaries.", "NTA.\n\nThe nerve, really.", "NTA but this woman has no idea of what is or is not acceptable.", "NTA\n\nNo one wants their parents or in laws staying with them the first few days after their wedding. That should be a role for you and your spouse to celebrate and be together.", "NTA for your decision (I remember I had people staying with me after my wedding and it ended up being fine, but definitely was at the expense of enjoying the post-wedding highs) but ffs be nice to your mom unless she\u2019s an AH. Also is she traveling from a far distance?", "INFO She asked, you said no, what's the conflict?", "NTA. Why does this need to be your problem? I\u2019d love to know what the distance/cost is, but really\u2026.unless you have a big house, nobody wants mom and grandma sharing a bathroom after the wedding.", "Info: Exactly how far away is she traveling? What expenses is she covering? You said you handled accommodations for two nights, but is she handling traveling costs, food, etc? How exactly is your mother's finances and just how much of a burden is this going to be on her? Its not a destination wedding but as your mother lives in another country it effectively poses all the challenges of one. You are going to get a lot of NTA votes but you need to keep in mind they are looking at this from the context of you getting to do what you want, not what might be best to maintain relationships. Do you actually have a relationship with your mom or is bringing her over just an obligation type thing? If you have no real relationship it obviously doesn't matter. But if you two do have a relationship, its probably going to be damaged by you not caring if she's able to afford a place to stay after traveling for your wedding.", ">I told her that her accomodation issues after the wedding are not my problem\n\nYTA for that **attitude** about it, yeah. \"Not my problem\" is an asshole's response.\n\nThis is your mother who you haven't seen in 4 years, and she's traveled from out of the country for your wedding. You've paid for a hotel the day before and the day of the wedding...so you expect her to bring her luggage to the reception then leave from there? Wtf.\n\nWhether her travel plans mandate she stay the extra days or whether she was hoping for some additional time with you, the least you could do is be a little more gracious about figuring out a solution.", "NTA for refusing to have anyone stay with you on your honeymoon, but YTA for the callous way you phrased it.
