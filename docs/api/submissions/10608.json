I suggested daycare or a housekeeper if everything was too much, but she didn't like the idea. and I said if she needs help at home, then I will take my paid paternity leave.

I told her that I have been really sloppy with my work, am constantly exhausted with body aches, and have made a few mistakes, so I am pretty sure I am no longer a top candidate.

Your mental capabilities and cognitive function are literally on par with a drunk person right now due to how little sleep you're getting. You're also at a significantly increased risk for a heart attack. I get she's doing the housework and childcare, but your health and contributions need to be taken into account. This is not a little thing either. Little things would be like starting a load of laundry before you leave in the morning and doing dishes when you get home. (Not that I'm saying you need to do that, I'm just using those as an example for the time it would take out of your day.)", "NTA I get her wanting help, and you offered solutions.

And she spits at them. \n\nIf this is how she's going to be, I can't imagine the marriage lasting happily.  \n\n>gives me 2-4 hours of sleep a night\n\nThat's unhealthy AF. If she's ok with that, she doesn't care about your well-being at all.", "NTA\n\nYou should not be driving with that little sleep. You will end up either dead or killing someone else driving in that condition. Your wife just needs to be told no. You don't sleep train 3 month old kids anyway. That's also ridiculous. \n\nShe needs her mom to come help. Hire an overnight nurse for the babies. \n\nAnd if she won't let you sleep, go get a hotel room for a day or go to your parents.

You need to be at home for a time.\n\nAlso I'm not aware of a single sleep training resource that recommends for 3 months. They're too little and it doesn't work. The earliest is 4 months but even then the efficacy is not great. For you this means the torture will continue. You have to make different choices to deal with your children's sleep needs right now.

I get that having a child automatically means less sleep for everyone, but if you are driving four hours round trip on top of a twelve hour workday, the lack sleep doesn\u2019t just affect you- it affects everyone else on the road.

What do you do?\n\nSleep training a kid, in my understanding, is go in every 5,10,15,20 minutes and give a minutes comfort and wrap them back up so they learn to sleep alone. \n\nIt takes about 3 days. \n\nSleep training a child for months where you are getting 2-4 hours sleep is not right for anyone. \n\nPlus you\u2019re working and driving 4 hours.

Your wife is struggling and sadly the lashing out is the symptom of that.  She has no right to treat you like garbage or silent treatment because that is not an adult solution.  She might need to see her doctor to deal with her feelings and talk with someone that can help.\n\nShe doesn't want you to take paid paternity leave yet she wants you to basically be up 20 plus hours a day and be successful at work and it won't happen.

She wants to know that the kids you both chose to bring into the world will have a dedicated set of parents. Daycare/nanny might be a touchy subject because your twins are still very very young.\n\nHowever, I do understand your frustrations.

In the night all they do is cry so I just Pick them up to calm them, then put them down, And they normally wake up to eat in the middle of the night.", "I don\u2019t know why. I ask, but she says they are strangers. I ask why she doesn't accept her mom, but she says she can handle it on her own. I have talked to her about therapy, but the thought of leaving our child alone does not sit well with her. I tried to bring up online therapy, but she said she doesn't have time.\u00a0", "You REALLY need to revise your wording. That is NOT sleep training, you\u2019re just on night duty. Sleep training is a structured method to get babies to sleep through the night and learn to soothe themselves back to sleep that is not appropriate or even safe for babies as young yours. If you were actually trying to sleep train 1-3 month old babies it would be cruel.", "If they\u2019re only feeding once in the night they might be hungry. What time are they being put down to sleep and how long do they sleep for in a stretch? \n\nBtw. That\u2019s not sleep training.", "If 3 months old baby wakes up crying in the night you FEED them and then they will drop to sleep very quickly.  You don't mention giving them bottle or passing them to mom for breastfeeding so they are waking up cause they are hungry. Little babies should be really fed on demand not being sleep trained...", "3 months old will wake up to eat. That's normal. They are starved.\n\nAnd are you driving everyday? Does she wants you to have an accident? I don't think this is sustainable at all, you need your paternity leave and you both need to talk to the pediatrician about the expectations for every stage, little babies do not sleep through the night.", "That is not sleep training. You should edit your post to reflect that. \n\nSleep training getting them used to putting themselves back to sleep. If you\u2019ve been doing this since birth, it\u2019s just the night shift. Your question should be more like \u201cAITA for telling my wife I can\u2019t do all the night feeds anymore?\u201d\n\nIf they\u2019re crying all night, they are likely hungry. How often are you feeding them through the night and how many weeks gestation were they when they were born? Infants this age need feeding every 2-3hrs, possibly moreso if they were not at 40 weeks gestation when born (which twins very rarely are). So between the hours of 10pm and 8am, your children should each be being fed 3-5 times, and your wife should definitely be doing some of those feeds. Are you feeding them that often? And are you feeding breast milk or formula? Formula digests more slowly and keeps them full longer, so you will probably be closer to every 3hrs, breast milk will be more like every 2hrs. That\u2019s from the start of the feed - if it takes 15 mins to feed them, they need feeding again in 1hr 45m.\n\nInfants need changing up to 20 times a day and feeding up to 12 times (and maybe more of each if necessary). Every time they cry, you should be checking their diaper, and offering a feed. Only if they\u2019re still crying after they\u2019re clean, fed and burped, should you be trying to rock/soothe them back to sleep. They aren\u2019t crying for the lulz, they\u2019re crying because they need help.\n\nNTA for needing more sleep, but you might both be assholes for not feeding your babies enough. As someone who is currently in the newborn stage too for the second time, I can\u2019t recommend sleeping in shifts enough. You go to bed at 8pm to sleep, you wake up at 2am to take over. Your wife stays up til 2am, she sleeps til 8am. You each get six hours uninterrupted sleep, and someone is always there for the babies. Keep the babies away from the sleeping person, they need to rest to do their day of childcare/work. We only have one baby right now, so my husband goes to bed at 9pm, and sleeps til 4am. I stay up til 1am for her last feed, and then sleep until my boobs start hurting and I need to get up to feed/pump, which is usually about 7am, and that\u2019s also when the toddler wakes up, so he\u2019s not on his own with both of them. (From 1am to 4am, all three of us are asleep, because the 1am feed reliably knocks her out.)", "This 100% sounds like significant postpartum anxiety. You may need to call her OB yourself, make the appointment and make sure you are available to take her. She needs help that she can't or wont ask for, but this is important. You need her to see a doctor.", "Thank you! Everyone is blaming her for being unreasonable when she\u2019s gone through the trauma of childbirth just three months ago. She needs help.", "NAH. Except for the silent treatment part. Parents of multiples break up all the time over stuff like this.  Hire the outside help.  You need your sleep and your job. Your wife need her sleep and a break.  Also, in my experience, sleep training multiples is not useful. They hit sleep regressions at different times and keep each other up even if in different rooms.  Maybe a night nurse is the right help?", "Is she breastfeeding? It's normal for small babies to wake up often and be hungry, but if she's breastfeeding, it could also be because they are simply not getting enough food. That can happen for mums with just one baby, but you have twins.", "ESH, you don\u2019t mean sleep training you mean night duty. Basically she wants you to be involved and not rely solely on hired help, you want to either hire help or have her do 100% of the work. The best solution is the paternity and that\u2019s where she sucks for not accepting that alternative, you suck because she\u2019s done all duties of childcare AND house work alone with twins for 3months without you really noticing and only when she complained did you offer any solution. \n\nYou both need couples therapy to be on the same page and work out the job situation as this can\u2019t carry on. She can\u2019t do all this alone and you can\u2019t keep missing their childhood. They\u2019re 3months old, how much time have you actually spent with them?", "I\u2019m sorry you are in a tough place. This advice is coming from my experience working as a postpartum doula for the past 5 years. \n\n1. You need to take your paternity leave - it\u2019s there for a reason and your current situation with sleep/driving/work/etc. is unsafe. \n\n2. Your wife is clearly struggling too. If she\u2019s able to have the conversation, talking about going to therapy or talking to her OB/midwife is a good idea. PMADs are super common and treatable. I\u2019m not suggesting that she is suffering with one but it\u2019s good to get an evaluation none the less. \n\n3. If you\u2019re financially able to, just hire the help. I would recommend starting with a postpartum doula or NCS for overnight support with the twins. They\u2019ll be expensive but you\u2019ll both get a ton more sleep. Secondary to that, get a housekeeper or even a teen/college aged student to be a \u2018mothers helper\u2019. \n\n4. As mentioned multiple times already, 3 months is too young to sleep train. It will not work and biologically there is a reason why they\u2019re waking frequently for food/comfort. The absolute earliest it\u2019s recommended is 4 months (adjust age for gestation/early delivery if necessary), and is more so supported at 5-6 months. \n\n5. Couples therapy could be warranted. The transition to parenthood is tough on any couple, let alone with twins which is much more physically draining.", "NTA\n\nYou can't sleep train until 4 months so it's pointless now and just frustrating.", "Maternity nurse here, also have degree in early childhood ed.\nQuestions:1 at what gestational age were the twins are birth?\n                   2. Birthweight?\n                   3. Breastfed, bottle-fed, mix of both?\n                   4. Current weight?\n    The ability to sleep through the night depends on age and weight. Your twins are 3 months post birth, but if they were born at 35/36 weeks, their brain development is closer to a two month old. They need to have a certain amount of weight to be able to maintain sleep. At their age, even at full term they would still need to eat at minimum every 3-4 hours if bottle-fed, every 2-3 if breastfed. Have they been slow to gain weight at the pediatric checkups. It sounds like they are not eating enough yet at a single feed to sustain them through the night.\n\nYour work and drive schedule are not sustainable without more sleep. Do you have a large life insurance policy to support your family, because what you are doing now is going to kill you. Or at least cause a bad enough wreck to severely disable you. Would your wife be able to sustain the life she has on disability pay while adding on caring for you?\n\nI'm glad you have decided to take your paternity leave and also start looking for a job that will fit better with family life. I don't understand your wife not wanting to accept the help now, but planning on hiring that help when you get a raise. She must also be sleep deprived with 3 month old twins.

They have slept together since conception and they may sleep longer if they are together.", "NTA.\nif you were my husband i would not expect you to cook or clean like ever. clean up after yourself? help load the dish washer every now and then? sure. but you work too many hours & pull in a lot of money for the family. i do worry about the absence in your children\u2019s lives as a result tho.\n\nalso info: is your wife a SAHM?", "NTA.

You need to be at home for a time.\u201d\n\nOP\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t want him to take his paid paternity leave, because he is up for a promotion with an increase in pay. She values money over his physical and mental health. It\u2019s also very dangerous to drive when you are that sleep deprived. OP also suggested paying for a housekeeper or a professional daycare, but his wife doesn\u2019t like that either for whatever reason. And his wife\u2019s mother offered help, but his wife declined.\n\nI think OP\u2019s wife is extremely unreasonable. OP works 6 days a week: 12 hours/day of work and 4 hours/day of driving. That\u2019s a **72-hour work week** combined with 24 hours of commuting! That\u2019s tough for anyone. And it\u2019s completely unsustainable AND dangerous on only 2-4 hours of sleep a night. \n\nOP is damaging his career by being sloppy and making mistakes because he\u2019s sleep deprived and extremely exhausted. OP is also damaging his body. He and his wife need help NOW, even if his wife doesn\u2019t want help. \n\nHis wife\u2019s expectations and behaviour are not normal and irrational. Something is off. Throwing the remote at OP is physically aggressive and giving him the silent treatment is passive aggressive (and emotionally immature). I wonder if her behaviour changed after giving birth. Does she have signs of PPD? Either way I think she needs mental help. And OP needs to sleep. \n\nI am also wondering about OP\u2019s future plans regarding his job and family life. Did he and his wife had a conversation about this before they decided to have children? Personally I think working 72 hours a week is very hard to combine with an active parenting role. The hours of his current job and the commute make him an absent husband and an absent father. Are there any pragmatic solutions to make his work-life balance more fitting to his new family life? Just for now. For example, can he work from home a few days a week? That would free up 4 hours a day. Or can he and his family move closer to his job to decrease his commute?\n\nI\u2019m voting ESH (a light one, because sleep deprivation has a negative effect on thinking straight and decision making), because as an adult OP is responsible for his own behaviour and he should not let it go this far.
