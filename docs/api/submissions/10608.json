Your mental capabilities and cognitive function are literally on par with a drunk person right now due to how little sleep you're getting. You're also at a significantly increased risk for a heart attack. I get she's doing the housework and childcare, but your health and contributions need to be taken into account. This is not a little thing either. Little things would be like starting a load of laundry before you leave in the morning and doing dishes when you get home. (Not that I'm saying you need to do that, I'm just using those as an example for the time it would take out of your day.)", "NTA I get her wanting help, and you offered solutions.

And she spits at them. \n\nIf this is how she's going to be, I can't imagine the marriage lasting happily.  \n\n>gives me 2-4 hours of sleep a night\n\nThat's unhealthy AF. If she's ok with that, she doesn't care about your well-being at all.", "NTA\n\nYou should not be driving with that little sleep. You will end up either dead or killing someone else driving in that condition. Your wife just needs to be told no. You don't sleep train 3 month old kids anyway. That's also ridiculous. \n\nShe needs her mom to come help. Hire an overnight nurse for the babies. \n\nAnd if she won't let you sleep, go get a hotel room for a day or go to your parents.

You need to be at home for a time.\n\nAlso I'm not aware of a single sleep training resource that recommends for 3 months. They're too little and it doesn't work. The earliest is 4 months but even then the efficacy is not great. For you this means the torture will continue. You have to make different choices to deal with your children's sleep needs right now. And your own. \n\nI get it, it makes sense that you're both at the end of your rope, but you need more support at home with twins.

I get that having a child automatically means less sleep for everyone, but if you are driving four hours round trip on top of a twelve hour workday, the lack sleep doesn\u2019t just affect you- it affects everyone else on the road.

Your wife is struggling and sadly the lashing out is the symptom of that.  She has no right to treat you like garbage or silent treatment because that is not an adult solution.  She might need to see her doctor to deal with her feelings and talk with someone that can help.\n\nShe doesn't want you to take paid paternity leave yet she wants you to basically be up 20 plus hours a day and be successful at work and it won't happen.

She wants to know that the kids you both chose to bring into the world will have a dedicated set of parents. Daycare/nanny might be a touchy subject because your twins are still very very young.\n\nHowever, I do understand your frustrations.

That's gonna be a yikes from me", "I am not even sure if what were doing is called sleep training. In the night all they do is cry so I just Pick them up to calm them, then put them down, And they normally wake up to eat in the middle of the night.", "I don\u2019t know why. I ask, but she says they are strangers. I ask why she doesn't accept her mom, but she says she can handle it on her own. I have talked to her about therapy, but the thought of leaving our child alone does not sit well with her. I tried to bring up online therapy, but she said she doesn't have time.\u00a0", "You REALLY need to revise your wording. That is NOT sleep training, you\u2019re just on night duty. Sleep training is a structured method to get babies to sleep through the night and learn to soothe themselves back to sleep that is not appropriate or even safe for babies as young yours. If you were actually trying to sleep train 1-3 month old babies it would be cruel.", "If they\u2019re only feeding once in the night they might be hungry. What time are they being put down to sleep and how long do they sleep for in a stretch? \n\nBtw. That\u2019s not sleep training.", "If 3 months old baby wakes up crying in the night you FEED them and then they will drop to sleep very quickly.  You don't mention giving them bottle or passing them to mom for breastfeeding so they are waking up cause they are hungry.

Does she wants you to have an accident? I don't think this is sustainable at all, you need your paternity leave and you both need to talk to the pediatrician about the expectations for every stage, little babies do not sleep through the night.", "That is not sleep training. You should edit your post to reflect that. \n\nSleep training getting them used to putting themselves back to sleep. If you\u2019ve been doing this since birth, it\u2019s just the night shift. Your question should be more like \u201cAITA for telling my wife I can\u2019t do all the night feeds anymore?\u201d\n\nIf they\u2019re crying all night, they are likely hungry. How often are you feeding them through the night and how many weeks gestation were they when they were born? Infants this age need feeding every 2-3hrs, possibly moreso if they were not at 40 weeks gestation when born (which twins very rarely are). So between the hours of 10pm and 8am, your children should each be being fed 3-5 times, and your wife should definitely be doing some of those feeds. Are you feeding them that often? And are you feeding breast milk or formula? Formula digests more slowly and keeps them full longer, so you will probably be closer to every 3hrs, breast milk will be more like every 2hrs. That\u2019s from the start of the feed - if it takes 15 mins to feed them, they need feeding again in 1hr 45m.\n\nInfants need changing up to 20 times a day and feeding up to 12 times (and maybe more of each if necessary). Every time they cry, you should be checking their diaper, and offering a feed. Only if they\u2019re still crying after they\u2019re clean, fed and burped, should you be trying to rock/soothe them back to sleep. They aren\u2019t crying for the lulz, they\u2019re crying because they need help.\n\nNTA for needing more sleep, but you might both be assholes for not feeding your babies enough. As someone who is currently in the newborn stage too for the second time, I can\u2019t recommend sleeping in shifts enough. You go to bed at 8pm to sleep, you wake up at 2am to take over. Your wife stays up til 2am, she sleeps til 8am. You each get six hours uninterrupted sleep, and someone is always there for the babies. Keep the babies away from the sleeping person, they need to rest to do their day of childcare/work. We only have one baby right now, so my husband goes to bed at 9pm, and sleeps til 4am. I stay up til 1am for her last feed, and then sleep until my boobs start hurting and I need to get up to feed/pump, which is usually about 7am, and that\u2019s also when the toddler wakes up, so he\u2019s not on his own with both of them. (From 1am to 4am, all three of us are asleep, because the 1am feed reliably knocks her out.)", "This 100% sounds like significant postpartum anxiety. You may need to call her OB yourself, make the appointment and make sure you are available to take her. She needs help that she can't or wont ask for, but this is important. You need her to see a doctor.", "Thank you! Everyone is blaming her for being unreasonable when she\u2019s gone through the trauma of childbirth just three months ago. She needs help.", "NAH. Except for the silent treatment part. Parents of multiples break up all the time over stuff like this.  Hire the outside help.  You need your sleep and your job. Your wife need her sleep and a break.  Also, in my experience, sleep training multiples is not useful. They hit sleep regressions at different times and keep each other up even if in different rooms.  Maybe a night nurse is the right help?", "Is she breastfeeding? It's normal for small babies to wake up often and be hungry, but if she's breastfeeding, it could also be because they are simply not getting enough food. That can happen for mums with just one baby, but you have twins.", "ESH, you don\u2019t mean sleep training you mean night duty. Basically she wants you to be involved and not rely solely on hired help, you want to either hire help or have her do 100% of the work. The best solution is the paternity and that\u2019s where she sucks for not accepting that alternative, you suck because she\u2019s done all duties of childcare AND house work alone with twins for 3months without you really noticing and only when she complained did you offer any solution. \n\nYou both need couples therapy to be on the same page and work out the job situation as this can\u2019t carry on. She can\u2019t do all this alone and you can\u2019t keep missing their childhood.

This advice is coming from my experience working as a postpartum doula for the past 5 years. \n\n1. You need to take your paternity leave - it\u2019s there for a reason and your current situation with sleep/driving/work/etc. is unsafe. \n\n2. Your wife is clearly struggling too. If she\u2019s able to have the conversation, talking about going to therapy or talking to her OB/midwife is a good idea. PMADs are super common and treatable. I\u2019m not suggesting that she is suffering with one but it\u2019s good to get an evaluation none the less. \n\n3. If you\u2019re financially able to, just hire the help. I would recommend starting with a postpartum doula or NCS for overnight support with the twins. They\u2019ll be expensive but you\u2019ll both get a ton more sleep. Secondary to that, get a housekeeper or even a teen/college aged student to be a \u2018mothers helper\u2019. \n\n4. As mentioned multiple times already, 3 months is too young to sleep train. It will not work and biologically there is a reason why they\u2019re waking frequently for food/comfort. The absolute earliest it\u2019s recommended is 4 months (adjust age for gestation/early delivery if necessary), and is more so supported at 5-6 months. \n\n5. Couples therapy could be warranted. The transition to parenthood is tough on any couple, let alone with twins which is much more physically draining.", "NTA\n\nYou can't sleep train until 4 months so it's pointless now and just frustrating.", "Maternity nurse here, also have degree in early childhood ed.\nQuestions:1 at what gestational age were the twins are birth?\n                   2.

Your twins are 3 months post birth, but if they were born at 35/36 weeks, their brain development is closer to a two month old. They need to have a certain amount of weight to be able to maintain sleep. At their age, even at full term they would still need to eat at minimum every 3-4 hours if bottle-fed, every 2-3 if breastfed. Have they been slow to gain weight at the pediatric checkups. It sounds like they are not eating enough yet at a single feed to sustain them through the night.\n\nYour work and drive schedule are not sustainable without more sleep.

Or can he and his family move closer to his job to decrease his commute?\n\nI\u2019m voting ESH (a light one, because sleep deprivation has a negative effect on thinking straight and decision making), because as an adult OP is responsible for his own behaviour and he should not let it go this far.

From what I have seen and have lived (having had two babies in one yr- so near twins), anyone with twins takes all the help they can get. Grandparents, family, friends, hired help\u2026 etc. NO one turns down help, so there is definitely something going on with your wife.  You will have to tread lightly, gently and softly. If it\u2019s an image thing, an anxiety thing, a mixture or something else. \n\n2. If it were me, I would be looping in her parents and your parents with regards to the dire situation you are all in. They should potentially be visiting more often (during the day) so she can start getting some rest and seeing for herself that the babies will be okay. But not pushing her or she will double down. \n\n3. I would also be sitting down with her and going over the anxieties and how she feels and how to remedy each one. If she wants you to get a promotion, not sleeping at night is not a possibility. She has to the logic and the reasoning behind it. \n\n4. Like others have suggested, making the OBGYN  or family doctor appointment or asking for one and going together. \n\nThe way she is behaving is not normal Op.\nPeople with twins usually have help, or are open to having some sort of help. The burnout for you and her is real and not sustainable. \n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffdYou can also post in relationship advice and look at post partum articles and articles regarding caring for twins. \n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffdMaybe some literature on the subject and how it\u2019s normal to accept help to avoid burnout. It may benefit you and your wife so she can see how others are experiencing the same thing. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you are going through this. \n\nGood luck Op!", "You\u2019re welcome to disagree and post your own judgement but I still think E S H. She\u2019s been raising twins on her own for 3months and it seems from him mentioning that because her mums means around she\u2019s not doing it \u201calone\u201d like that absolves him from being involved in his kids lives. She wants HIM to be involved in not just depending on her mum to help, which I feel is completely reasonable as he admits over 90% housework and childcare falls on her. She\u2019s not unreasonable to want her partner to be there with her to raise their kids but she is for not considering alternative solutions and coming to a compromise. I think they both need to be on the same page and have both taken each other for granted in different ways.", "The issue is it was never directed towards the wife. Reading the thread I took it as you were recommending therapy for OP. I can see how others did too.", "They don't prevent them generally. There are very few careers where that would be an issue, and many of those are capped around 70 hours per week.", "You are entitled to your opinion but I genuinely do not understand how you can think that he\u2019s wrong at all yes she\u2019s doing it \u201calone\u201d but he actually tries to fix it and every solution that he proposed so they can fix that has been shut down by the person that\u2019s complaining about doing it alone"]}
