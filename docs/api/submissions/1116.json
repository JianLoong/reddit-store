Sounds like you're already on the right track of saying no. \n\n\nIf you ever say yes, know you aren't getting the money back and they'll ask again and again.", "NTA - your money, your choice. These people are virtual strangers to you - it would be different if they genuinely expressed love and remorse towards you, but using you as a cash pump is a big nope. \n\nIt can be hard to overcome feelings of guilt when it comes to family - perhaps spend some of that money on therapy instead.", "NTA\n\nOnce you start subsidising your mother and sisters lives, it will never end. It\u2019s your money, your life and your decision.", "Backstory is irrelevant; you don't owe your parents or adult sister money. NTA for saying no.", "NTA. You're not their piggy bank, and $1200 is not \"short\" on a mortgage, it's really bad budgeting.", "NTA. you have no obligation to give your hard earned money to your mom and sister. Your sister should ask child support from the children's father like drug dealer supposed to be filthy rich.", "NTA. They're not your responsibility.", "Nta. You dont even need to explain any of this. You are a grown adult whos money is yours. You have no obligation to give money to anyone especially your crappy family. Block them and move on.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t responsible for them. Also 1200 for a mortgage is crazy for someone who makes 13 an hour. There is no way for her to sustain that mortgage. That\u2019s only 2200 a month IF she works 40 hrs and has no taxes, insurance or anything else taken out. Let\u2019s say 300 for taxes and such. She only brings home 1900. That means she only gets 700 a month to pay her car payment, car insurance, food, cc bills, utilities, clothes, incidentals and such. If you pay anything on her bill this month...you will be expected to next month and the month after. the life she has decided on is NOT sustainable.", "NTA. These adults are not your financial responsibility. Your sister can feed her kids if she stops all her non sense. They just feel entitled to your money.", "NTA. They\u2019re adults and need to take responsibility for themselves.", "Never lend money. NTA.", "NTA. Your relationship is basically non-existent. Simply because you share blood doesn't equate to helping them out whenever and however they ask. \n\n  \nThey are adults. If your mother can't afford the mortgage she  has multiple options.  \nGetting roommates, renting out a room, getting a better paid job etc.\n\nYour sister should get her priorities straight. Less alcohol, drugs and partying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, if you want to help out your sister's children DO NOT SEND MONEY. Send food instead. IF your sister complains about it, I doubt she wanted to use the money for her children.", "NTA you aren\u2019t obligated to give money to your family.", "At 13 an hour I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad budgeting. I think it\u2019s impossible to pull off. If you do the math and say she works all 52 weeks a year and divide into 12 his mom only makes 2200 a month before taxes, insurance and such. It\u2019s 100% unsustainable", "More to the point, how did she even *get* a mortgage that expensive on her own with that level of income, since she has been in the same job long term. Sounds more like a scam to me.", "That's the important point -- these requests are just feelers.  If you say yes you'll face endless requests, blame and drama.", "Yeah that one crossed my mind as well. I\u2019ve purchased three houses in my life. (All in the  USA...other places may be different) it\u2019s almost impossible to get a mortgage if you don\u2019t have a high credit score, minimal debt and something like 30% of your income max to the mortgage. Plus (I live in a low cola) 1200 is like a 200k mortgage depending on the interest rate. At 13 an hour thats 53% of her pretax income. That\u2019s crazy high. If you take out 300 for taxes and such that becomes 63% of her income.\n*edited for clarificafion*", "Yeah most mortgages banks are willing to lend 4-5x annual salary maximum. 1200 a month is way beyond what any bank should have okayed."]}
