This year my parents are letting my gf (18) come who I have been with for almost a year. \n\nI live with my parents because I go to community college for the time being. My gf is a senior in highschool. Now every once in awhile she sleeps over and my parents don\u2019t mind if we sleep together on the couch. \n\nMom said to me a few days ago that my gf will be staying on a pullout couch in a bedroom with my cousins 14 & 16  F and I will be in the bunk bed room with my brothers. I told my mom that it would be much more comfortable for everyone if my gf and I stayed on the pullout in the game room. \n\nMy mom shut me down and said I\u2019m not sleeping in the same room as my gf. She says my grandparents are there, as well as little cousins and the rest of the family and I\u2019m too young to be sharing a room. Especially since my gf is a senior in hs and I have cousins in hs. \nI told my mom that I\u2019m not a child and She should stick up for me instead of my families delicate sensibilities. \n\nThis is when my dad chimed in and said \u201cboy get a job and start paying me rent if you\u2019re a man. Maybe than you can stay together.\u201d He knows I don\u2019t work to focus on my studies so he\u2019s being ridiculous. He agreed with my mom and said I\u2019m too young. \n\nSince then I stopped cleaning up after myself at home. I leave dishes in the sink and food on the table. Sometimes I don\u2019t flush the toilet. When my parents get mad I tell them that how can they expect a child to remember to do all these things?
