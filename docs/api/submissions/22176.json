I\u2019m going so someone should watch the kids.\u201d I then left without talking to anyone. \n\nWhen I got home I checked my texts and found a rant from her, saying that they were her stories and she could feel any way she wanted. She called me sensitive for \u201cnot taking a joke\u201d and suggested I get a therapist (I already have one and she knows that) because I was \u201cjealous of a 4yr old\u201d.

If she doesn't acknowledge and apologise for this terrible act cut her out when are financially independent. She isn't worth it. \n\nI am sorry you had to endure this. You looking around the house for change, breaks my heart. I hope you deal with your childhood trauma in the right way. No child deserves that as their childhood memory.", "Sounds like your mother is a piece of work. Getting drunk at your 4 year Old bday is a huge no anyways. \n\nYou should continue seeing your therapist. And maybe think about how to redefine your relationship with your mom.\n\nI hope for your sister's Sake that stepdad can counter the bad attributes of your mother. That things said plus getting sh**faced at her daughters bday indicate to me that at her core she will not be that much of a better mom to her than to you. She might have her own issues, but that for her to figure out.\n\nShe probably made a fool out of herself with the other parents around.", "nta", "NTA, leave that house immediately", "NTA, but what did your stepdad say about this?", "NTA at all holy shit is that beyond messed up... As a fellow accident kid I feel your pain. I'm actually going through something somewhat similar in terms of reconnecting with my parents... They too are divorced, but split up when I was 18 and graduated, but fought all the time. I have a younger brother and he was most definitely wanted.\n\nHe was showered with everything he wanted, spoiled by my mom. Dad didn't really have much of a say with him in terms of whether he could or couldn't get anything or punishments when he was younger for some reason. It was like he's your moms kid so w/e. Brother made a very big mistake and basically got a slap on the wrist, which pissed me off, because if it was me that did what he did, I would have been grounded for eternity. This lead to some resentment, which I now realize wasn't his fault and we have many things in common.\n\nWith that said I hope you don't hold any resentment to your half sister Melody. I don't think you will based on what you said it came down to luck. What your mother said was absolutely fucked up, and for her to brush it off by saying it's how she felt and you should seek therapy is not fair to you and her trying to be free of responsibility/guilt. I can see her even trying to blame her words on the alcohol too soon as a way to cope with her possible guilt. Don't let her off the hook.\n\nThere's no such things as practice kids. Parents can make and learn from their mistakes from their first kids, but to brush them off like you didn't matter or to make you feel worthless was completely out of line... Sorry this is so much, this just hit home for me. Again NTA, best of luck OP.", "NTA. Your mom better not be surprised when you barely visit her in the future.", "NTA!! You stated your feelings and left to avoid any conflict. It was the ideal thing to do. You need to take care of yourself first\n\nAnd no matter the age, the sting of knowing your value is viewed below someone that should be your equal (you and your sister for example) by someone significant like your mom can be very damaging to your mental health. Doesn't matter if it's a joke or not", "NTA\n\n\"No, mom, I'm not jealous. It just hurts to see that you're not the least bit remorseful about what a shitty mother you were to me. I'm happy you get to have a do over to be a parent, and I love my sister to bits. But I'll never get to have a do over to be a happy kid in a stable home, which did mess me up and I am in therapy for it, as you know, and I just think you could be a little more empathetic to that.\"", "What on earth OP, you are absolutely NTA, please stay as far away from that woman as you can", "NTA\n\nYour suffering should not be a source of amusement for her. And from one oldest kid to another, you are more than just a \"practice kid.\"", "NTA. If it's any consolation the school mums were probably thinking WTF and probably think less of her now. Maybe you should point out the \"practice kid\" stories make her look like a total loser and she is just embarassing herself. Next time say to her friends even though she learnt so much on the practice kid she is still a sloppy drunk and a lousy mother.", "Like others have mentioned, there is very little civil I have to say about what your mother did.  All I can do is reassure you that you are NTA and if it helps I know how I would feel if someone was talking like that about their child especially if that child was in earshot and I'm sure many of your mums 'friends' felt the same", "That's not your mum love, that's your practice mum as she did a horrible job. I'm glad you turned at ok. Start referring to her as that and see how she likes it", "I would be so uncomfortable being one of the other mothers forced to listen to this kind of stories. It\u2019s insane to me that an adult can think that their abusive behavior, a behavior that most likely have caused trauma on a child, is a story to tell as a joke and brag about. And I would went my feelings with the other mother\u2019s and trash talk about yours. Not because she was a mother at young age, with no money and because she at the time made the discussion and mistakes she did. But for the way she talk about them, that is her true character and a choice she\u2019s making now.\nNTA", "Your mom was drunk at her 4 year olds party. NTA. You already know that everything she said about you was cruel and you deserve better from a parent. I\u2019m sorry you had to hear all of that. But don\u2019t worry, those parents heard it too and I\u2019m sure your mom isn\u2019t going to be that popular once she sobers up", "NTA. I am so sorry. I wish i could give you a hug right now. You sound like you were a lovely little boy growing up and i am glad you stood up and left. It\u2019s horrific how she talked about you and you deserve so much more.", "So sorry. Nta. She sounds horrid.", "NTA. I\u2019m frankly surprised this post hasn\u2019t been locked by a takedown of your mom\u2026 But similarly I\u2019m not expressing anything that would cause me to get banned\u2026Because your mom is not worth it. Suffice to say you\u2019re definitely not the asshole, not only in this situation but clearly not at all.\n\nAlso I\u2019m sure all of those other people present also thought she was a complete asshole, especially because All this was said with you right there.", "NTA.  Even if you are jealous of a 4 year old NTA.", "With the amount of alcohol your mom was chugging, I'm sure Melody is going to have her own therapist soon enough. Some people should not raise children. I'm sorry you had one of them. NTA", "How is your relationship with your sister? And what did your step-father have to say about all of this?\n\nNTA btw", "I can't believe she's not mortified and embarrassed after finding out you overheard her calling you a practice kid. That alone would mortify me. NTA and sorry you have a mother like that", "NTA. you reacted in a mature and polite way. You expressed your hurt, did not make a scene and made sure the other adults knew someone had to take over child care. Meanwhile, your mother got drunk at a 4 yo's bday party and shared some horrifying stories. FYI, I as a mom would have been heartbroken by your struggles and disgusted by her take on them, Im sure the other parents were as well. It's clear in this story who the better adult is, so whatever you're doing in therapy is working. I don't think you're the practice kid as much as you think, your mom seems to have some pretty significant limits in having empathy for others, respecting social conventions and validating other people's experiences, she just has more cash now. The absolute, most benefit of the doubt explanation I can think of for her behavior is that she was trying to re write history in her own mind to feel better about the kind of mom she is and felt shame when you called her on it, causing her to lash out. And let's be real, that's still really not great. Sorry your mom has these limits, keep on keeping to go down a different path.", "NTA\n\n\nYour mom is the one that clearly needs a therapist if she thinks getting shitfaced at 4 year old\u2019s birthday party is normal. \n\n\nAfter the stunt she pulled retelling these awful stories that do NOT paint her in a good light, guaranteed her new middle class yuppie mom friends distance themselves from her.", " I would cut her off", "NTA though if possible, get some distance", "Yeah hope mom had fun making herself look extremely trashy in front of the other mothers. She will be the common gossip for months to come I promise", "NTA, tell her she was a practise Mom too and you have had enough and don't need more practise.", "Oooh if I was one of those mums listening to that she would not hear back from me.", "NTA they are your stories too and while she can feel however she wants it\u2019s cruel af and toxic to share your trauma in such a nonchalant way", "Yep, and I bet every single one of those women that this AH was telling her \u2018hilarious\u2019 stories of neglect to feel the same way. They all likely felt so sorry for the op having this woman as a mother. It\u2019s one thing being poor but it\u2019s quite another to laugh and revel in your child living in a chaotic, disadvantaged house.", "Yeah none of those moms saw this as \u201cfunny\u201d or \u201ccute\u201d, guaranteed. Sounds like she made quite the impression for herself.", ">Drunk Words are Sober Thoughts\n\nYeah no. Unless I've got some deeply hidden hatred for my bedroom lamp that caused me to start shit talking it that's not always true.\n\nI mean I chat loads of shit when I'm drunk.", "Right? No wonder they tried to change the subject to kindergarten, they were uncomfortable AF. But mom told another awful, awkward story. Ha ha, I use to get in screaming matches with my ex, and my son was desperate for them to stop. Ha ha ha ha. I couldn't buy him proper clothing ha ha ha ha.", "NTA and yeah, that's what I was thinking. Nobody is going to want their kids around this kind of talk/behaviour.\n\nI hope your stepdad is a lot kinder to you, OP, and that your mum apologises.", "My family was pretty fucked up growing up. My brother and sister have recounted \"funny\" childhood stories in front of partners and not seen the looks of horror on their faces. \n\nMy brother once asked me to speak to his girlfriend to tell her how much he had changed after telling some of the more disturbing shit (some violent stuff and one about locking me in a dog cage and shoving me in a closet for the day instead of baby sitting me). \n\nYou can let go of the stuff, but when the person responsible makes jokes about something traumatic for you, it's not good for your mental health. It dredges up those feelings and if they laugh about it, makes it even worse as it's just dismissive of the pain they inflicted. That even though they remember it they still don't have the empathy for you and don't recognise their role in it.", "I think you should also consider having a serious conversation with your stepdad, your mum getting shit faced and trauma dumping onto a bunch of strangers does sound very healthy.  It screams if I don\u2019t laugh about it I\u2019ll cry\u2026.she needs therapy.", "I had an aunt that used to tell these type of stories about my cousin. Trust me when I say no one thought it was funny. I have a feeling that deep down she didn't either, it was some weird coping mechanism to avoid acknowledging her own shitty behavior. No one thought any less of my cousin, just her. I'm really sorry you had to go through that, op.", "Remember, we all think terrible things at times. We are all our harshest judges and yet also try to justify that we're good people when we've done bad things. We aren't our thoughts. We're our actions. And your mom's actions here were cruel. She likely needs to reassess her relationship with those memories and take ownership for who she was, and until she does that... It's not good to let your inhibitions go when you're lying to yourself. Your Mom exposed how she lies to herself. It's not your job to encourage her to get help with this. But it is your place if you feel up to it.", "Yup saying it shitfaced too like lady read the room lmao wtf", "This is better than my abbreviated version - much fuller (I'll delete mine as I've only just come across this post...........)"]}
