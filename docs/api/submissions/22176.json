They have a daughter together, my sister Melody. \n\nI\u2019m not blind, I know they shower her with attention and buy her everything they can because I had nothing when I was her age. When I was younger, it frustrated me to see her loved in a way I never was, but now I know that my mom did her best with the experience and resources she had. It\u2019s just bad luck that it worked out the way it did. \n\nWith that context out of the way, Melody recently turned 4 and my parents went all out.

The conversation, which I was not part of but was listening to because I was bored watching the kids, turned to sharing stories about their kids. My mom, instead of sharing cute stories about Melody, decided to tell a group of random moms about the time I tried to make my parents stop fighting by collecting change lying around the house and giving it to them (I was 7). She was laughing the whole time and ended the story with \u201cAh the things you learn with the oldest, practice kids am I right?

My mom, who by then was shitfaced, decided that it would be a *great* idea to share the story of how she karened the school into letting me do gym class in my winter boots because that was the one pair of shoes I had. Again, she told the whole story with a grin on her face and laughing. The last thing she said made almost blow up; \u201cThank goodness Melody can have all the shoes she wants, though with how much shit (my name) pulled at that age maybe it was best I didn\u2019t waste money on the practice kid.\u201d  \n\nI texted my mom \u201cI\u2019m glad you find how poor and miserable we were so funny, but it really upsets me how you clearly think of me as practice for Mel. I\u2019m going so someone should watch the kids.\u201d I then left without talking to anyone. \n\nWhen I got home I checked my texts and found a rant from her, saying that they were her stories and she could feel any way she wanted. She called me sensitive for \u201cnot taking a joke\u201d and suggested I get a therapist (I already have one and she knows that) because I was \u201cjealous of a 4yr old\u201d.

So I think it's important that OP not give their mother an overt excuse to ban him from Melody's life.", ">She met her husband and she gave ne her phone yo order seamless\n\nI  see you edited to add a judgment, but can you edit to explain this?  I can't come up with a translation, lol.\ud83e\udd23", "I am so glad you know your worth and found someone else who knows too. It always makes me happy when I read someone has founda true keeper and partner.", "I am so sorry you both had to go through that. I am happy  you managed to hold on to each other despite all of it. I wish you both well.", "I think it's \"gave me her phone to order seamless\" (Seamless is an online food delivery service)", "My brother was slightly older than four (six maybe?) and my uncle walked in and asked for a beer at his birthday party (all the adults would have beers/wine but not to excess). His present for bro was comming with our older cousin so my uncle did not have it with him. My brother's reply \"No birfday no beer.\" LOL", "Don't feel guilty!  And my wife always says her best parent was not a biological parent - also her step-dad (now adoptive dad).  Tell him you love him and appreciate him!.  Look for ways to show it but go to college (and therapy) and stop feeling guilty!", "You are not jealous of a 4yo. You are traumatised by a mother who doesnt seem to give a shit about you (thats just my observation) if you are in a position to id suggest maybe moving out and telling egg donor that until she realises how much shes hurt you and takes responsibility for her shitty behaviour then you dont want to hear from her at all. Have a good like  with the kid that you love.\n\nYou are nta and your mother is a real piece of work. \n\nGood luck OP i hope you find peace away from her toxicity", "All the while I was growing up, my mother would introduce me as \u201cthe odd one\u201d.", "Oh sweetie, NTA.\n\n\nI didn't realize how f'd up my childhood was until I got older and started telling other people my 'funny' stories. And no one laughs and you look up and see a bunch of big wide eyes\n\n\nIt may take a while, but you will be loved the way you deserve to be", "You are absolutely NTA.  If you were the 'practice child' then your mother clearly learnt nothing. Melody may have more resources available but her mother getting shitfaced at her 4th birthday party and dumping her emotional issues on strangers doesn't bode well for her future either. Both of you deserve better. Your mother needs professional help immediately, before she further damages you both.", "Lol, you're _still_ the practice child - even now your mom is learning the hard way the importance of healthy parent-child interactions and how to appropriately talk about your child. By the time Melody is 19 you will have filed off your mom's sharp edges.", "NTA!  NTA!! NTA!!!  \nYour mother is an insensitive idiot who probably feels guilty about the past you shared, but that's no excuse. Your SF sounds like a decent guy, I suggest that you sit down and have a heart to heart talk with him. Maybe he can see your side of things without feeling attacked.", "NTA.  Tell her your suffering as a child should never be a joke to her.  Tell her she should be embarrassed telling those stories because they show her to be the terrible parent she was.  You really should go low contact with her.", "NTA - alcohol is a truth serum.  She may cut you off in the short term, but she should eventually come around and apologize.  Hopefully.", "NTA.\nwhat a disgusting woman. Please go NC", "NTA. Your mother was completely out of line. You handled it well, she didn\u2019t. She was completely inappropriate and insensitive", "NTA. Your mother was behaving appallingly and I am sorry to say that the other mother is there will have been quite shocked.", "Oof, I suspect your little sis may have less friends after this party. Those moms are going to judge hard. She's probably going to learn that the hard way.", "Well deserved too. I bet she\u2019ll be the subject of some horrendous gossip herself.", "> Drunk words are sober thoughts huh? That\u2019s a new phrase, I hope it\u2019s not true but damn\n\nAs a general saying - Yes OP it is true.  Being drunk generally makes people less inhibitive and their brains loosen up and things they generally keep hidden from the world will be blurted out because they don't think before they speak.", "Believe me when I say that reading your post made me feel sick. \nSo there is a complete stranger over here in New Zealand that is sending you love too.\nGo forth and live your best life.", "> Besides, he has more class than what she was displaying there.\n\nHe did didn't he, left the house without blowing her up in public and politely texted her his feelings so it could be sorted privately.", "> She\u2019s basically saying OP deserved the childhood he got\u2026\n\nWell said", "Now that makes sense.  Thanks for the translation \ud83e\udd17", "NTA she's screwed up your childhood and blamed it on you. I feel very bad for you, keep her out of your life, she won't notice that your gone.

I\u2019m so sorry OP.", "I am so sorry that that is your mother. You don\u2019t have to keep her in your life just because of that. Love, loyalty the title of mother are things that are earned. You are not sensitive or jealous of a 4 year old. Go no contact for you own mental health. Small kid and drunks always tell the truth. This is how she really feels. Don\u2019t let her get you down, some times our biggest bully is our flesh and blood. Sending you love", "I am so proud of you, I just wanted to say that. Family can be hard especially when our parents aren\u2019t mentally stable or able to support us in the ways they should. You have a lot of maturity in how you are approaching healing your trauma.  \n\nKeep on going and don\u2019t let anyone else define who you are, you get to decide that.  \n\nOh and if it wasn\u2019t clear NTA.", "Hahaha yeah. I went over to her place and she gave me her phone to order seamless. And the google search history was hilarious.  Supposedly they got drunk off beer and free hotdogs and ran around looking for elvis impersonator.  I started bffs wedding fund that day habahaha", "I know you've probably done this, but it's a really good idea to verbalize how much you appreciate support like the support your step-dad has given you.  It can mean a lot to the other person, but is also helpful in focusing on the positive in one's life.  \n\nNTA of course.  You handled the situation with class.", "Yeah, getting drunk at a kid's birthday party is strike one, oversharing while drunk, strike two... she probably did something else objectionable and is going to find herself not on any social calendars. Feel bad for the kid who isn't going to get invited to stuff because the parents are worried they'll have to interact with OP's mom.", "Although your sister has lots of material things, she\u2019s going through life with an emotionally immature mother. I hope you can distance yourself from your mom and maintain a relationship with your sister. You seem like a good influence.", "As others have said, your mother just told you how she really views you. Do you have the option of getting out of that situation? At 19, are you in college, working, or what's your situation? Have you considered joining the military? If I knew my mother thought so poorly of me, I would be looking for any way possible to get out.", "Stop calling her Mom. She clearly never was one.   \n\n\nAlso, you\u2019re stronger than me because I would have told her I\u2019d rather she had just dropped dead so at least I\u2019d have a better mom \u2620\ufe0f \n\nNTA", "The change story hurt my heart as a mom and as a kid. Who tf as a mother thinks that shit is funny?\n\nYou're NTA here babe. You should however tell your mom to get fucked.", "NTA - I hope you can find some mentor and get some real support in life instead of this cheap excuse for a mother.\n\nYou don't say how her remarks were received, but typically the bonds aren't that close with other daycare moms, and I would have been horrified.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so sorry {{}}", "NTA\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists\n\nThat's not normal, that's not kind and her reactions, after the fact, are deplorable.\n\nSorry you're dealing with a mother who thinks your traumatic childhood provides her with drunken fodder.", "I am so sorry. Of course, NTA.\n\nYou've accepted that it was your luck to poor parents who didn't know how to act, either. You've accepted that your half-sister's luck was to have a dad who's financially responsible and compensated enough to take give her things you could never dream of. You do not ever have to accept being considered a 'practice baby' or be talked about (\"how much sht you pulled\") or be told you are sensitive to feel sad that child you tried to scrape together change from the couch to stop your $hitty parents from arguing.\n\nI imagine those other moms were wanting to just give you a big hug.\n\nYou can excuse your mom in her youth for the money struggles; but she gets no pass now for her on-going immaturity, lack of care for her own child, insecurity, etc.\n\nWhat about your step-dad? How does/would he view your mom's behavior and words? How does he treat you? Do you get more things that you need/want now? If he seems like a good parent, can you talk with him more?\n\nIt sounds like at least your mom is in need of some serious counseling. I hope the counselor you see can help be a voice on your behalf with both your mom and step dad.", "I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through this. You are an amazing brother and son. Hopefully your Mom will some day get sober. I\u2019m glad you have a therapist. If you need more support, consider beginning attending Al-Anon and/or Adult Children of Alcoholics (ACOA). It isn\u2019t much comfort, but I found recognising the addiction disease was talking and not the addict in my life that was saying and doing the shitty things. I hope when the time is right for YOU, you can forgive your Mom for your own peace of mind.\n\nYour Step-Dad sounds amazing. And, it sounds like you are a great son to him. I hope you can focus on your goals and wish you the amazing life you deserve!", "First off, you are NTA.\n\nI don't think you are jealous of your kid sister. You are upset your mom is making light of painful memories for you and not even slightly understanding you.\n\n My parents seperated after years of arguing, and I know how you feel. My mom never really understood why I was upset when she brought up things about then fighting and being generally horrible. Years of therapy and talking with her, I've come to understand \n1.  When she thinks of those times, she thinks of her painful memories and sees the hurricane that surrounded her. \n2. She feels horrible for what I went through and can't do anything to fix it, and she feels she failed as a parent for not noticing the pain then.\n\nI think your mom might have similar feelings. I say this because she's making an active effort not to do the same for your sister. \n\nI think maybe her saying you are a practice kid might be her coping mechanism to avoid feeling like a horrible parent for what you went through. This way she feels like okay. It happens to everybody, and the 1st kid is tough and messy for everyone.\n\nThat said, you should know that you are not mean to be messed with a you are not a practice kid for anyone. You are valued human being. I am sorry you went through what you did. Do keep up with the therapy because you will get to a place someday in the future where your past whilst painful will not define you and your successes are in spite of everything and you feel great about yourself."]}
