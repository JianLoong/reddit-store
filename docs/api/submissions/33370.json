I know it sucks having to pay for an extra seat but it is what it is. I know Southwest Airlines has this \u201ccustomer of size\u201d policy but I\u2019ve had some bad experiences with Southwest even before I was obese so I wasn\u2019t doing that and it\u2019s mostly my fault I even got fat. \n\nEverything goes smoothly from checking in to security and boarding, at least at first. This woman comes to my row with a boy who appeared to be about a year old. She told me to squeeze in to one seat so her son could sit in the other. She told me, not asked. I told her no and that I paid for this seat for the extra space. \n\nShe makes a big fuss over it, which got the flight attendant\u2019s attention. She told the flight attendant I was stealing the seat from her son, then I showed my boarding passes, proving that I , in fact paid for the extra seat. The flight attendant asked me if I could try to squeeze in, but I said no, that I wanted the extra seat I paid for. The boy, who the mom said is 18 months old was supposed to sit in her lap so he could do just that. The flight attendant eventually told the mom to put her son in her lap. I got dirty looks and passive-aggressive remarks from her for the entire flight and I do feel a little bad because the boy looked hard to control so AITA?\n\nEDIT: I did not fly SWA", "created_utc": 1703018313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18mbv9j/aita_for_refusing_to_give_up_me_extra_seat_for/", "score": 7935, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was rightfully yours! \n\nIf the mom knew her kid would make some trouble, she could\u2019ve bought an extra seat herself.

Am I crazy or do I remember seeing in various places on the internet people complaining that fat people should purchase an extra seat if they're going to use an extra seat? And OP did exactly that, purchased an extra seat, even if she technically didn't even have to (that part was unclear to me).  And even THEN, she was told that she should give up that seat. So what was she supposed to do? Purchase 3 seats? WTF? What if there was another toddler on the other side? Is she supposed to purchase a seat for that toddler too? Where does it end?  Yes, OP, YTA for not buying a seat for every toddler on the plane with irresponsible parents.  /s   The nerve some people have seems to have no limits.", "Nta you wanted 2 seats, so you paid for 2 seats.  She wanted 2 seats and paid for 1. Tough luck, lady", "NTA\n\nYou bought two seats. You get to use two seats. Her lap child flies free, but the cost of that is that she doesn't get a seat for him. She is allowed to purchase him a seat if she wants one - she just didn't.", "NTA. I bet the same woman would have thrown a tantrum if you had bought only one seat and inconvenienced her with your size. You did everything right.

NTA at all and good luck on your weight loss journey.\n\nETA: what would she have done if that seat had just been purchased by another person? She wouldn\u2019t have had a purchased seat to swap.

It's just ick.", "So her plan was to somehow snag an extra seat on the plane without paying for it? Lol, that\u2019s not how it works.

NTA.", "NTA, and please make a stink with SWA customer support. SWA used to be good about this, but it seems to me like they're being jerks about it lately.\n\nI say that because I use the same policy as you do and buy two seats, but when I flew last summer, I got patronizingly scolded about it, interrogated about who \"gave me an extra seat\" (no one did, I bought it!), and told I wasn't fat enough for an extra seat. Hilarious because if they'd decided I was too fat for one seat, they'd have forced me to buy another seat or take another less crowded flight. They told me I had to either accept a forced refund for the second seat, or not fly that day. I wasn't going to forfeit an expensive planned trip, so I agreed. In the end, they left the seat next to me empty anyway, which was bizarre.\n\nIt's BS that we're damned if we do, damned if we don't.", "I\u2019ll die on this goddamn hill. If you want ANYTHING that costs money for your kid, YOU pay for it. You want their own seat? You better buy one. OP, please stop self-flagellating for your weight.

I cannot believe the entitlement of this lady expecting you to foot the bill for her kid\u2019s seat.", "NTA. It already sucks that you had to buy an extra seat, but to then have cabin crew try to steal it from you is outrageous. I'm glad you held firm against the entitled mom and the cabin crew.\n\nThe only acceptable response from cabin crew in that situation should have been telling the entitled parent that \"I'm sorry, this seat is taken\"", "NTA, you paid for the seats you are using. Simple.", "NTA that is insanely entitled of her.", "NTA.\n\nYou paid for it. It\u2019s yours to do with as you choose.\n\nIt would be fine if she asked. It\u2019s not fine that she felt entitled.", "NTA.  Odds are, her kid was over 18 months and she was trying to get a free seat for him. You paid for that extra seat. It doesn't matter why.

Nah, you paid, you keep.  I'd go to the airline about the flight attendant.\n\nParents who cant, or wont, control their kids should not be traveling with them.", "Nta.

I wouldn't have given the seat up either.", "So you paid for two seats and she paid for one but thought she should get the extra seat for free\n\nNTA", "NTA you paid for the extra seat, and I doubt that you would have received a refund if you had agreed. The flight attendant should never have asked you to squeeze in somebody else's child. I would report that to the airline.", "OP, you went out of your way to be considerate both to yourself and others. That lady's lack of preparation does not constitute an emergency on your part.

Sorry you had to go through this.  You were 100% in the right here.  I understand why she wanted some extra space without paying for it -- I totally hoped for the same thing whenever I traveled with a lap kid -- but if it's not available she doesn't get to have it.  I can't believe the flight attendant even asked if you could try to squeeze in.  You may want to write to the airline to let them know that happened, there's no doubt that's not their policy.", "NTA.  Your weight is irrelevant.  You bought the usage of that seat, it is yours to use.  You're under no obligation to do otherwise and to suggest it, that FA should be reminded of that.", "NTA.  I am always amazed at the people who think they are entitled to other people\u2019s property, and that includes a flight attendant trying to force you out of the second seat you paid for.    What MAY help in the future is to tell the woman \u201cI paid $300 for this extra seat.  The only way I\u2019m going to even try squeezing into one seat is if you pay me that.\u201d  And to the attendant \u201cWould I get compensated by you or the airline for the extra $300 I paid and wouldn\u2019t be able to use after giving my seat to a child that doesn\u2019t have a seat assignment, thus the parent paid less for their ticket?\u201d\n\nMany of these people seem to think it\u2019s like on a bus and I don\u2019t think they realized you pay extra for the space.

They can blame you all they want. But do not feel bad about refusing to compromise yourself because they didn't plan. \nAnd what would that woman have done if there was someone else in that seat? Nothing. \nShe tried to steal a seat from you that you paid for. She failed to plan properly. It's her fault. \nYou are NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou are a little bit of an AH for how apologetic you are in this post about your size.

That they didn\u2019t even pay for?! Then I question the flight attendant. How can she even ask someone to let them use it after they show her it was paid for. Unbelievable. \n\nTA is the parent and the flight attendant since she made the entitled parent think she had rights because someone in charge backed them up, rather than OP who was well within her rights to the seat.", "Me too, I'm so glad I found this lil thread \ud83e\udd7a no matter why or how, you are allowed to take up space!
