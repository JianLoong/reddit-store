They asked for an RSVP with options for food, and the items listed were pretty standard meat, fish or vegetarian. \n\nMy boyfriend is a selective eater. He\u2019s not diagnosed with anything but I think it\u2019s related to some sensory issues. He has also not met that part of my family but they would like to meet him so have kindly invited him to the wedding. \n\nI asked my boyfriend to let me know what option he wanted and he asked what specific dishes they were. I didn\u2019t know but said I\u2019d text them to find out. I did feel a bit weird about doing this because it felt a bit entitled for an essentially free dinner - maybe that\u2019s just my own pride but I didn\u2019t want my boyfriend to feel uncomfortable on the day so I texted my aunt.\n\nAfter a few days she hasn\u2019t replied (I can imagine planning a wedding is very busy) but asked my boyfriend if he would be okay to pick one as I don\u2019t want to pester my relatives. I also wanted to RSVP in a timely manner. He responded that if they wanted quick RSVPs they should respond to questions quickly. \n\nI said that I really didn\u2019t want to come across as entitled to my aunt over food options especially as wedding planning is stressful. \n\nNow he wants to contact them having never met them to ask about food as I have said I wasn\u2019t comfortable nagging and was finding it stressful. I agreed on the condition I chat to my mum first to see if she knows more - then I can avoid nagging them again.\n\nAITA?\n\nUpdate: I managed to briefly call the wedding planner as to not bother my aunt and confirmed, as I suspected and many of you suggested, that there were still tastings and things to happen. I sat him down and explained that was the case.\n\nHe basically chose an option then and there and said he now understood he had been unreasonable.

If hes such a picky eater he should just eat something he likes before or after the wedding.", "NTA\n\nI get it.  Some people have food sensory issues.  But you don't hound people planning for their wedding.  A question about food from the boyfriend of a niece rates a 1.5 on a scale of 1 to 10 for someone getting married soon.   Boyfriend needs to pick a meal, act like he enjoys it, and get on with his day.  It's a  meal at a fucking wedding.  In 3 weeks, he won't even remember what color his socks were that day, let alone the meal.\n\nLeave your aunt alone.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend however is a huge AH. They have provided not 1, not 2, but THREE options. Pick one because newsflash it is not a restaurant where he gets to select the items from a menu at an establishment where he is paying for the meal. He is attending a  wedding reception to celebrate a marriage and being provided with a meal paid for by the host. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nIf he is so concerned he can eat before the wedding or after.", "NTA. It\u2019s fine if you ask mom for information but then he needs to choose from the selection offered. He\u2019s a piece of work. Hard work.", "NTA. i think you\u2019re right that your aunt is overwhelmed with details.  I wouldn\u2019t pester her. Yes, ask your mum and go from there.", "NTA. As someone with a shit ton of food allergies/intolerances, I would never pester someone about their wedding menu options. Pick one, hope there's at least a part of it you can eat, and prepare in case there isn't. I usually eat a little something ahead of time and then have a little something in my purse/car just in case.", "NTA \n\nThey probably haven't picked a final menu and are waiting to know how many people pick each item.\n\nHe should prepare to eat some salad and bread rolls, and eat after the event", "You need to pick your option and RSVP for 1. He's being an AH, especially considering he has never met them. You're definitely NTA.", "NTA - I am autistic and have food sensitivities, as does my partner. I think asking them once is fine, but they are very busy planning the wedding. I would have said NAH but him contacting them is a little much.\n\nI would suggest choosing different food options for both of you (as long as you aren't vegetarian) so that you can mix and match if needed. He could also bring a couple quiet snacks to munch on in case he isn't a huge fan.", "NTA, your boyfriend is terrible", "My husband is exactly like this. He always eats before we go and then politely doesn\u2019t eat what he doesn\u2019t want to. He has sensory issues as well. Tell your BF how you think he should handle these things from now on, and help him adjust his behavior. If he keeps acting like this, dump him. People can\u2019t help their issues, but they can learn how to manage them in society. Your F is very young. Do him a favor by helping him learn.", "Your boyfriend is entitled and ridiculous.  Your aunt has better things to do and accommodating a picky eater is not one of them.  They have a vegetarian option, and though you do not say it, I would imagine they would accommodate food allergies, but beyond that, what are you expecting?  Are you expecting that your boyfriend can specifically detail out a personal menu for himself just because he has undiagnosed sensory issues?\n\nThat will not fly, and if he attempts that he will make a terrible impression.  \n\nThe remedy for this situation is to have him eat something before you go to the wedding.  If you arrive at the wedding and some of the food is not to his liking, then he can pick at what is, and at least not be starving.  \n\nUntil he gets a specific diagnosis for this issue, he will be considered a \"picky eater\" and in nearly all situations will be looked at like a petulant child, who is spoiled and entitled.", "NTA.  I get BFs concerns (no one wants to be left hungry), but a wedding isn't a have it your way, right away dining experience. Fixed plates are expensive enough, nevermind personalized entrees for each guest.\n\nTo clarify, considerations for folks with allergies are a different matter.", "NTA. \n\nedit. I'm just floored by this. I can't even comment beyond you're not the asshole.", "NTA\n\nYou are making the right decision not to bother your aunt. Depending on who they are using to supply food, catered, kitchen, food truck, they may not know the exact dish yet. The easiest solution is to choose whatever is closest to his food preference & then get more details when it\u2019s closer to the wedding. Meals can be changed on the wedding day to accommodate dietary needs. \n\nI recommend he not choose fish (unless he loves fish) because its based on supply & demand... substitutions are always made last minute", "NTA\n\nHe's an entitled baby however. One meal at a wedding ain't going to kill him. Damn!\n\nPS. If he acts this way, I can guarantee he's not going to impress anyone in your family.", "Just bring a bottle of his favorite Gerbers baby food, and call it a day!", "NTA -- your BF is.", "NTA \n\nYour boyfriend sounds pushy and entitled. And rude. To expect people to just jump at his requests is awful behavior. Your family is planning a wedding and you\u2019re correct in saying that they are busy. And you\u2019re a very thoughtful person!  How kind you are. \u2665\ufe0f\n\nFact is.. they listed the options for the food.. he can take it or leave it. For him to assume that he\u2019s allowed other choices if he may not like what\u2019s being served.. makes him a asshole that\u2019s for sure. Life doesn\u2019t work that way.  \u2026 I mean .. what\u2019s he going to do? Tell them.. I don\u2019t like those options and I have sensory issues so I need something else to eat.. I\u2019m really sorry if this sounds insensitive.. but weaponizing a condition is not cool to get your way in everything and I feel that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing here. Especially since it\u2019s \u201cundiagnosed \u201c. \n\nHe can either suck it up or not go. Please don\u2019t allow him to control you or your family this way.", "NTA. Sounds like you know it\u2019s silly to keep asking about this on his behalf let alone let him do it without having met them. I\u2019d go with your instinct and just leave it be. Tell him to pick a meal or you will. Surely you guys could just swap meals on the night or he doesn\u2019t have to eat it.", "NTA and your bf sounds like an entitled child. Just pick something for him and tell him to eat bf he goes. This isn't freakin Burger King, and he can stay home if he's so concerned. How embarrassing......you sure you want to keep putting up with this kind of high maintenance entitlement?", "NTA but your boyfriend is. Is he going there to eat only? Bring some snacks and if he can't eat the dish, ditch the dish. Too much hustle for a simple meal here.", "If you think this is a serious issue & not just him throwing a fuss, pick something different from him, worst case you guys can trade. \n\nYou're definitely NTA here though, he can eat before or after or bring himself a juice pack.", "Y-W-B-T-A if you pestered your aunt about what specific dishes are going to be available. She's \\*kind of\\* got a lot going on right now. Right now, NAH...yet.\n\nYour option to ask your mom is a good one. I imagine she's a little involved, and would be better able to talk to someone about what's for dinner.\n\nEither way, even if your mom hasn't been able to get an answer, you need to send in the RSVP. The dinner is not the make-it-or-break it. There should be \\*something\\* your boyfriend can eat, and if not, you won't starve. One of you order vegetarian, one of you order meat (or fish; whichever, pick two) and you can mix-and-match from your plates. DO NOT BUG THE BRIDE.\n\nEnjoy the wedding!", "NTA, but your boyfriend is horrible.  His weird eating issues are nobody's problem but his.  He didn't want to meet and get along with your family, he just wants his own way to accommodate his weird, super picky eating.\n\nHuge red flag.  If you stay with him, you will be dealing with this everywhere you go for the rest of your life, or missing out on things because of his weirdness.  Get away now.", "NTA. Picky eaters should be the ones settling for the items they can eat out of what's suggested to them.\n\nThe tiresome process of having to listen to their endless list of demands and restrictions is just something the average mperson should not be bothered with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what we have. eat it, or STFU. bye.", "NTA he is a guest of yours , you can ask your mother or possibly contact the catering place and ask them & explain you don\u2019t want to annoy the bride groom & hosts as they are extremely busy but other then that there\u2019s not much else you can do & if he\u2019s so worried about food he either eats before or doesn\u2019t go", "NTA.\n\nWedding is usually bulk food cooking.  They are unlikely to cater to 1 person unless allergies of some kind.\n\nHe's not leaving a good impression if he pushes this issue too hard.  Just eat something beforehand if he cares that much.", "NTA - As an extremely limited eater myself, your bf is being unreasonable. He should just assume and prepare as though he won't want to eat what they serve. If it turns out he will eat it, he can be pleasantly surprised. His problem is his problem. Don't let him try to turn it into your problem or your families' problem.", "NTA. If he's that worried about the options he can eat before the wedding and pack some snacks. I see by your update that it has all worked out which is awesome.!", "NTA. \n\nAre your parents close to your aunt? Maybe they could reach out and ask.", "NTA. Don\u2019t contact your aunt again and don\u2019t have your mom do it either. They have enough going on as it is. Tell him to pick one and he can eat before he goes in case he doesn\u2019t like it. I have life threatening allergies and I would never pester anyone about the food they are serving. I simply eat before I go.", "Your boyfriend sounds entitled, the way you think is something I consider mature, you tried to accommodate him, you did ask and your are clear your aunt is busy.  Your are dying this great, you boyfriend isn't. \n\nNTA for you AH for him", "NTA, but your boyfriend is. You have been given options - plain and simple. He just needs to suck it up and pick one. Weddings are not buffets, and like you already said, your aunt is probably stressed enough with planning the event without having to deal with some picky eater she's never met.", "Omg Leave your aunt alone!!! YTA for even engaging in this conversation with your boyfriend! Has he ever been to a wedding before?? Frankly I\u2019m shocked you\u2019re still bringing him after he\u2019s shown you his entitlement.", "NTA. You are right, if he's never met them, that would be a very weird first contact indeed that would color their whole impression of him. If he Is afraid he won't like what's served, he can eat before the wedding and just nibble on the bread roll or something.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say YTA. I couldn't imagine not accommodating dietary preferences/needs for guests. I know the wedding is essentially about the couple...but I viewed my wedding as bringing my family and friends together so they could ENJOY celebrating me and my husband. Not some \"beggars can't be choosers\" thing. Pre-selecting meals is pretty rare where I come from, but selecting based on just meat/chicken/veggie seems so weird to me and seems to take the choice/autonomy out of it for me. \n\n\nI'm not a picky eater, but I really don't like cream sauces....given no other information, I'd probably choose chicken, but if it came out in a cream sauce, would probably barely touch it.", "Your boyfriend sounds like TAH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019ve got Celiac, and at the time my husband (then BF) was a pretty picky eater.

My husband (though not diagnosed as anything) is a super picky eater (he eats only potato, peas, chickpeas, cauliflower & lentils/rice). he would not eat anything from this list also if it is touching another food that he wouldn't eat eg. if they served hash browns in the same box as a piece of tomato or onion he wouldn't eat the hash browns either. I have learnt from 11 yrs of my marriage that 1. I am not his mother & not his keeper so i don't have to intervene on his behalf especially to my side of the family(who are very unfussy eaters), 2. he is a grown ass man who can take care of himself (having survived 35 yrs before he met me).\n\nWhen we go to weddings now or when we travel, he ensures he can eat at home earlier or after we return in case he doesn't find food he can eat. if its an extended situation, he will research restaurants who can work with his specifications or we will carry provisions to cook.  Once when we were travelling back from Italy with long flights and layovers, he didn't eat anything for a solid day and a half (the stewards were very sweet and offered him his veg meal + even a kid meal option since he didn't eat the veg meal but he declined everything).

He needs to take his own snacks, eat before or eat after.", ">he\u2019s worried he\u2019s going to be ~~unable~~ unwilling to eat it.\n\nFixed that for you.\n\nYTA, but for hassling your aunt.  This is going to be the rest of your life: harassing other people in ways that are usually regarded as socially unacceptable in order to pander to your partner's control issues.  To judge from your edit you and he now realise that.", "You pick one. He picks a different one. Then he eats whichever one appeals to him more. Works even better if you have a sibling who is also willing to pick the third option and swap but either way he\u2019s got pretty good odds of having something he will eat.", "Unfortunately, this is not uncommon. You can always send another text saying, \"I don't mean to be rude, I was just curious what the meat dish is? It would help us choose if we knew if it's chicken or beef ;)\"\n\nIf they don't respond after that, tell your bf he needs to choose. If he gets there and it's something he can't eat then he should be prepared with snacks of his own. Also, there might be a salad bar, appetizers, etc. he can eat as well. But no, you should not harass your aunt because he's a picky eater. That's his problem, not hers.\n\nTip: When in doubt, choose vegetarian (even if he isn't one). They're usually plainer dishes (pasta, rice, veggies, etc.) and easier for picky eaters to enjoy.", "Then get him his own fast food meal. Or uber eats. He is being overly entitled to expect more of a breakdown than what you already got.", "The options aren't \"vague\", they are normal for any wedding where a choice is even offered.  Normal people aren't so picky that they need to know the details.  Your boyfriend is weird, picky, selfish and demanding.  Have him choose one without more details or stay home, he's only going to embarrass you.", "If you are OK with all three options, you pick one, he picks another and, if necessary, you swap.\n\nI'm glad your BF realised he was being a bit precious though.", "NTA but you bf sure is.  A meal at a wedding is a nice gesture and not required.  He makes a choice and grabs a snack bar for the car ride home if is hungry after.  Being picky is fine but making it a big deal to others isn\u2019t.", "Then he should plan not to eat the food if he\u2019s so picky. He should eat ahead, pack a sandwich or whatever his safety food is and if he wants either decline the meal or pick the option that sounds the most safe. You can always pick another option and offer to switch with him if you feel like being accommodating but you\u2019re not required to do this.", "INFO: is your boyfriend a newborn who will suffer greatly if he can't eat for a few hours? /s", "Your boyfriend needs to grow up. \n\nIf he\u2019s that picky he needs to eat ahead of time and push the food around his plate at the reception. Maybe bring granola bars in your purse if he gets hungry later. \n\nYour boyfriend\u2019s attitude is is very very rude. \n\nI say that as a mom to a child with diagnosed sensory issues. It\u2019s not a free pass to be an asshole.", "You don\u2019t allow it to intrude on any way for your aunts wedding. He can eat before if it\u2019s a problem.", "You can also go to restaurants by yourself to try the cuisines you want to! I eat solo at restaurants sometimes and I just sit at the bar (if there is one) and just chat with the bartender! It\u2019s great!", "A boyfriend that is difficult to manage should be an ex boyfriend.", "What foods does he like and not like? I'm a picky eater myself so I am kind of sympathetic to him. If there are patterns in the type of food he doesn't like, you could likely pick a category that carries the lowest risk of food he doesn't like.\n\nFor example, if he is like me and most of the food he dislikes contains meat then it would be the lowest risk to go with the vegetarian meal. Picking such an option would be the meal could be converted into something he likes if there is a food he doesn't like in it with minimal alterations.", "He might have restrictive food intake disorder. It seems he had bad food related experiences in the past which gives him anxiety when he needs to go to places where he will be expected to eat without knowing what's on the menu and afraid to try new things. Food trauma is a real thing.", ">It\u2019s hard on dates because we are kind of restricted to a few cultures. I love food and want to try different cultures but I\u2019ve just had to make that a with friends thing instead.\n\nDrop him.  Get someone who isn't a toddler.", "Why is this a problem?\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t like the food he doesn\u2019t eat it. \n\nTell him to order the veggie one like you & you can help him clear his plate so it doesn\u2019t look too obvious if he\u2019s embarrassed about that aspect. \n\nHe needs to assume that none of the food will suit him & plan accordingly. This approach simplifies things amazingly. \n\nTake snacks. \n\nI\u2019ve been known to take a packed lunch to a wedding and eat it in the car between ceremony & official meal (as in, after driving to the second location). Coz some weddings plan to feed the guests at weird non-meal-times and I\u2019d prefer not to be starving hungry while waiting around :-)", "He\u2019s already making it awkward. You actually called the wedding planner and the caterers about this. Are you his mommy?", ">He\u2019s just worried it will be a food which he doesn\u2019t really gel with\n\nFFS.  How old is he?  Six?", "Even if he can\u2019t eat anything in his plate is doesn\u2019t have to be awkward. I doubt the hosts will be coming around checking everyone\u2019s plate to see what they\u2019ve eaten.\n\nHe can just accept the plate, eat anything he can, and move on. The less he comments on the food, the less he pays attention to it, the less fuss is made overall, the less other people will notice that he\u2019s not eating it.\n\nI\u2019ve been to a wedding where the caterers messed up and there were no vegetarian meals, although there should have been. And most of the vegetarians ate the few vegetables offered and commandeered the dinner rolls and moved on. The bride and groom did not know anything had gone wrong until the following day.\n\nIt only becomes awkward if he makes it awkward.", "I hope it helps!\n\nIt can be difficult, that's for sure! It's ok to say to him that asking isn't something that would go over well, so let's work together to find other solutions to the potential problem!", "Don\u2019t mediate. Help him learn how to handle his issues. Take him for a burger beforehand.", "You\u2019re not being ableist. Especially if he\u2019s undiagnosed at this point.", "He DOES NOT HAVE ALLERGIES.  He's just picky.  There is a huge difference.", "Then your best option is to bring snacks because I\u2019m hoping he\u2019s not expecting a different option only for him.", "What food does he like and what food does he not like?", "The mental gymnastics you\u2019re putting yourself through because your grown ass bf may not enjoy a meal is astounding.", "I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s selfish at all! I agree, it\u2019s highly reasonable lol I think he will have many problems moving forward as there are going to be many situations where you don\u2019t always know what you will be getting and sometimes just have to either put up with it or go without. Everyone has had meals they regret ordering, sensory issue or not \ud83d\ude1b can you try ringing the venue directly? They might be able to tell you the menu and won\u2019t have to both the bride to be", "No this is NOT okay to do. What is wrong with you????", "You\u2019re going to leave a note with the caterer telling them which foods they can and cannot serve at your aunts wedding?  Without your aunt knowing?  That\u2019s not something you can do.", "How many months until the wedding takes place?\n\nAnd do you think it will be more of an affront, if your partner opens up a few tupperware containers during the meal?\n\nCan you introduce your partner before the wedding, as in weeks or months prior?", "Just spend the money and hire a baby sitter.", "LOL", "> Pack a protein bar in his coat pocket\n\n>put some trail mix in the glove compartment of the car\n\nFantastic ideas if her boyfriend is 6 years old.", "Whaaat? He can take her dish if it appeals to him more? Or another guests dinner??? Fuuuuuccck no. Dude needs to stay home if he can\u2019t handle one meal.", "That was funny for me to read bc in my circles the ;) reads as very passive aggressive", "Picky ass \"selectovores\" are a real thing too.", "He can eat before he goes then.", "\u201cBoyfriend is a picky eater? Dump him.\u201d\n\nGod I love Reddit.", "I told him to speak to his mum too as hopefully she understands the contexts of weddings a little better. He\u2019s a smart guy but social things I would know as common sense he doesn\u2019t seem to really get (hence my suspicions about him being ND) but it\u2019s hard to know if he\u2019s just being stubborn or it\u2019s a diagnosable thing - I\u2019m not a professional lol", "But i think the entire point is that it seems rude to come to a \"free dinner\" and pick at a meal \"you chose yourself\" like a kid. Having autism is a lot about having control over what happens to you and meals are a big part of that. He probably wants to appear \"normal\" despite needing accommodations when it comes to food. \n\nSure, he should have stopped when OP said they're probably busy with the wedding planning, but again, it's a social cue, an autistic person might not get.", "I don't think OP is being ableist either, but do want to point out that ableism can happen without a formal diagnosis.", "You absolutely can be ableist to someone who doesn't have a diagnosis.", "I\u2019m astounded by the amount of people saying to pack snacks for him as though he\u2019s a toddler. It\u2019s mindblowing how much energy the OP is putting into this.", "He\u2019s not he\u2019s just scared of the unknown. he\u2019s not thatttt entitled haha", "Not anymore haha - will update above", "Fantastic idea! I\u2019ll look into that or ask him to. It probably shouldn\u2019t be me having to do all this for him honestly when he\u2019s capable", "To ring the wedding planner? I asked how the food options worked and she kindly explained how I can put any dietary in the RSVP email\n\nI suspect you mean in terms of putting in as an allergy, it was what the planner advised although it was a brief phone call.", "I bet the wedding planner thought it would be something like \u201cI\u2019m allergic to mushrooms, if the dish I\u2019ve selected has them, please give me the other one\u201d not \u201cHere\u2019s 30 foods I don\u2019t like\u201d.", "We live across the country, unfortunately, so no chance to meet before.

One of those things is low impact and one is crazy.", "And then be called ungrateful for refusing free meal, you are expected to eat during these events at the table with everyone else, eating the things preparef by the host and not from a tuperware brought from home.", "Have you tried telling him bluntly / extremely clearly: \u201cI have asked once, it would not be socially acceptable for me to ask a second time, so I will not do that\u201d.\n\nIf your suspicions about ND are accurate then it needs to be stated that clearly.", "Yes he is - weddings are super stressful. If he is really picky he needs to know how to handle HIS issues without being a burden on others. As people said he can pack a protein bar or make sure to eat before the wedding or double down on the bread", "At this point the specific fish might be unknown to the \\*bride\\*. Sometimes they make those choices later, or the venue gives options based on what's in season or whatever.

Simply postpone my rsvp until I get the information that I politely asked for.", "Or just autistic.", "Right, YOU bring them because you\u2019re aware of your situation.

Unbelievable how some women cater to men\u2019s incompetences.", "If you briefly say he can\u2018t eat many things it\u2018s fine.
