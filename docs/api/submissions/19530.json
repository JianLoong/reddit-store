But your parents also won't be able to see what money comes in or goes out of your venmo account. Only if you transfer money from venmo to your bank account or vice versa. Soooo probably in your interest to actually get venmo (bonus you can still use cash for 99% of your life like myself)", "YTA. You can't skip paying for a meal when it is your turn.

You\u2019re 21, and you really should have your own bank account independent of your parents. Many people don\u2019t like carrying cash because they don\u2019t want to risk losing a large sum of money. \n\nFor example, I live in a major city, and never carry more than $20 at a time. Why? Because robberies happen or cash gets lost. Then I\u2019m just out the money. Credit cards are secure, and so are banks. With apps to transfer money, I can pay friends back immediately if we split the cost of something. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with using cash\u2026but sometimes you have to meet your friends halfway and at least hear them out, which I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re doing.

There is no excuse for being so inflexible. It takes very little time and effort to open a Venmo account. She has no reason not to. Her friends aren't required to pay her back using cash.
