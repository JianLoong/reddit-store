I know having cash is super convenient, I use it all the time to pay people back, buy my own things, etc. But the \"secret\" account is now used for disposable money for fun stuff my husband and I enjoy (it's empty now, but that's another story lol). It's always good to have multiple options, and some banks offer incentives to open accounts with them (ie $250 to open a checking account, free toaster, whatever).

Or even asking for a separate bill.

Transferring money from cash into your account means having to travel to a bank, which can take a decent chunk out of your day. Having to transfer it into cash, at the very least, means an ATM. Both of these things are *very* out of the way, if you don't normally use cash. The only other alternative is to have cash sitting there for god knows how long, until you have the opportunity to give it straight back to OP - which is kind of an exercise in futility, and is also kind of annoying if you don't usually keep cash. A lot of people don't even have a proper *wallet* anymore, they just keep their credit cards in their phone case.\n\nOP is essentially forcing all their friends to adjust their whole financial lifestyles to accommodate the fact that they refuse to use a card. I would honestly just make OP pay for themselves every single time, rather than deal with that song and dance.", "You are right. Without knowing the situation hard to judge. I should say \u201cexcept maybe the parents but that\u2019s not really relevant here\u201d", "They keep dodging that question", ">Her friends aren't required to pay her back using cash\n\nBy that same logic, she isn't required to open a Venmo account. She instantly pays back the person who paid for the group. If they can't pay their share back in cash to her then she is not required to pay for the group and any one else can. I don't know how why this is a problem or why OP should pay for the group when everybody gives back their share.", "I suppose I could, but I don't have a way to get money into it that easily. Unless I just deposited all of my cash, but idk if thats the best decision.", "I totally understand that it might be an inconvenience for them, which is why I've offered to pay them back instead or split the check or do whatever if they dont want to deal with it. I'm more frustrated that they know I only use cash, accepted me paying for them knowing that I don't use Venmo or anything like that, and then won't pay me back using the method that they have known I use. \n\nI don't want to make them do anything which I agree with you is really rude, but I don't like that they act like my method is fine until its time to pay me back for what they owe me then its an issue, if that makes sense.", "I have answered above a few minutes ago. I technically could, but I don't really have money to put into it.", "Just pay for your next dinner with cash and have your friends Venmo you money.  Then you have money in the account.", "This is such a simple idea idk why I hadn't considered it before \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d. Thank you I'll see if this can work!"]}
