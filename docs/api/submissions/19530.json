I know having cash is super convenient, I use it all the time to pay people back, buy my own things, etc. But the \"secret\" account is now used for disposable money for fun stuff my husband and I enjoy (it's empty now, but that's another story lol). It's always good to have multiple options, and some banks offer incentives to open accounts with them (ie $250 to open a checking account, free toaster, whatever).

Or even asking for a separate bill.

Transferring money from cash into your account means having to travel to a bank, which can take a decent chunk out of your day. Having to transfer it into cash, at the very least, means an ATM. Both of these things are *very* out of the way, if you don't normally use cash. The only other alternative is to have cash sitting there for god knows how long, until you have the opportunity to give it straight back to OP - which is kind of an exercise in futility, and is also kind of annoying if you don't usually keep cash. A lot of people don't even have a proper *wallet* anymore, they just keep their credit cards in their phone case.\n\nOP is essentially forcing all their friends to adjust their whole financial lifestyles to accommodate the fact that they refuse to use a card.
