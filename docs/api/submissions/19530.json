I know having cash is super convenient, I use it all the time to pay people back, buy my own things, etc. But the \"secret\" account is now used for disposable money for fun stuff my husband and I enjoy (it's empty now, but that's another story lol). It's always good to have multiple options, and some banks offer incentives to open accounts with them (ie $250 to open a checking account, free toaster, whatever).

Or even asking for a separate bill.

Transferring money from cash into your account means having to travel to a bank, which can take a decent chunk out of your day. Having to transfer it into cash, at the very least, means an ATM. Both of these things are *very* out of the way, if you don't normally use cash. The only other alternative is to have cash sitting there for god knows how long, until you have the opportunity to give it straight back to OP - which is kind of an exercise in futility, and is also kind of annoying if you don't usually keep cash. A lot of people don't even have a proper *wallet* anymore, they just keep their credit cards in their phone case.\n\nOP is essentially forcing all their friends to adjust their whole financial lifestyles to accommodate the fact that they refuse to use a card.

In my friend group, we looove to be the one putting it on our cards for the points.", "I have suggested separate. They get frustrated because it makes it more difficult in a restaurant or more time consuming in a line, for example.", "Because OPs friends are being AHs for pressuring OP to use a very specific form of payment rather than any of the alternatives OP has suggested. Also they have stiffed OP multiple times.", "Do it anyway.  They can be together and you will order separate.  Stand in line for yourself.  It isn't harder at a restaurant at all.", "If you tell the restaurant at the beginning, it\u2019s usually easier. It typically only takes more time if they have to split the check up at the end.", "Exactly. I\u2019m a college kid and less and less ATMs and physical banks are available (plus ATMs not associated with your bank brand often have extra fees). I don\u2019t have a car and have to bus/walk/bike everywhere - a bus ride specifically for the bank just does not make sense.", "It's not ok for your friends to not pay you back. They owe you that money. Just because venmo is easiest for them doesn't mean they're not obligated to pay the debt if it's not via venmo. \n\nYour solutions of pay cash/check later, leave you out of the group tab or just keep it where you're handing cash to whomever is covering the tab that night are all perfectly reasonable.", "I know it can be inconvenient if you dont use cash! But they all know my preferences and that I don't have a venmo. I think its fair that I've suggested that I don't participate in this rotation at all, but some of my friends are really upset by that. I'm really not trying to force them to use an ATM but if they want me to cover, they know in advance that I do things in a certain way.", "Don't need to close the old accounts, really. Just open a new one, transfer all the money, stop using the old one.", "That\u2019s fine, but they can\u2019t refuse to pay her back just because she doesn\u2019t use Venmo. \n\nThat\u2019s being an asshole and a thief.", "imo its a pretty big inconvenience, idk why they don\u2019t just get paid in cash though", "why doesnt that apply to OP who should learn how to get paid back in more than one way and shouldnt be reliant on just one?", "So basically all stadiums and ballparks? Guess no sporting events or concerts for you then", "I would be careful with this.  If there are fees based on these old accounts and you never close them the fees keep being charged. If no one is putting money in eventually the account is in arrears and then they charge exorbinant fees for being \"overdrawn\".", "Her friends could just find a store that does cashback, buy some gum or something and get cashback. It\u2019s literally not difficult.", "Because cash is always useful, and you shouldn't have to link things to your banking information.", "That\u2019s exactly what you could do, at least for the purposes of opening the account.", "Where we live venues are starting to not accept cash at all.", "Thank you. I was made to feel like an AH for suggesting it.", "This is what I can\u2019t understand.  Why not just do this?", "dont let other people owe debt to you if you can only take cash", "Now you\u2019re moralizing. Is good to be flexible, but only for them not op", "Nah, lots of people don't realize their Venmo, PayPal, or CashApp balances aren't FDIC insured. Education is a good thing!", "*That's* why I'm saying the friends are the AH.", "These are aren\u2019t companies, they\u2019re individuals.", "But, they knew this going into it. It\u2019s no excuse.", "Cash is extremely flexible and they know in advance.  They can get ready for it at any time before, and OP has also said they're fine with not covering the total and will just pay their own portion.  OP has presented multiple options.  \n\nOP has been flexible.  The others are the ones that want only their way.", "The next time one of your friends pays, instead of giving cash for your portion, have someone who owes you money venmo the payer your portion.", "Find out if your university has a Credit Union you can use. Credit Unions are usually better than banks. Then go to the Credit Union and find out if they have people or information that can teach you how to best use your bank account. Things to avoid and things to always do. You need to become very financially literate! Also check your credit scores and make sure no one has opened any credit in your name.", "You can get a \u201cVenmo\u201d debit card as well btw and it\u2019s free, same with cashapp", "Good!!!! This is a great solution.", "Make sure to set  any new accounts up with electronic communications only so they don't mail anything to your parents' house, including tax documents if you make income on the interest rates (in the US you shouldn't have to pay taxes on this unless you have a high enough paying part time job or other income that you need to pay income tax at all).\n\nAnd look into places with student accounts, whether that's a bank or credit union. You may be able to open up something with very little minimum balance and no fees, or a checking account to use for venmo and a linked savings account to make some nice interest. Just don't forget after you graduate that this may roll over to \"normal\" accounts with different fees or rules. \n\nIt's a great idea to have your own bank account and learn how to use it before you're out on your own though, especially if you're used to others controlling all your finances for you. Good luck!", "And next time it\u2019s Becca\u2019s turn to pay, deduct what she owes from your payment portion. This\u2019ll  get the balance down that she owes you.", "I\u2019m leaning towards saying OP is AH too because they know this is the best option but they aren\u2019t taking it up.  I think it\u2019s ridiculous to keep participating in this rotation when you know this issue will keep coming up.", "So why should an individual be more inconvenienced than a company?", "Op has been exactly as inflexible if not more so, in her declining to take payment in the way comfortable to her friends, when they extended that same courtesy to her.", "Also, you can set your venmo to private, or set individual transactions to private, if you need or want to.", "Just use a venmo checking account", "you expect me to go out of my way all the way to my own bank to use the atm and take out cash? what an extreme waste of time. and then id have to coordinate when to meet up and give it to you. and for what? i understand her parents are controlling but thats still unreasonable to ask from your friend.", "That's the beauty of Reddit, everyone comes up with different judgements based on the same info / situation!\ud83d\ude01", "I expect adults to not cry about going by an ATM in advance when you know someone's turn is coming up for you to pay them.  And it's good practice to have cash on hand for emergencies anyways."]}
