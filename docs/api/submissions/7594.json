We were having dinner and the conversation over dinner was going well until my mom and gma brought up the conversation of marriage and kids. They asked when we planned to get married and we said it wasn\u2019t our main priority. Mind you we have just begun our careers and are not in a financial state to even consider a wedding. My mom's rebuttal to my statement was that she would cover any expenses, which also meant she would control everything, I said firmly no thank you we'll wait. They also discussed kids and said we\u2019d have to have them quickly because my \u201cfertile clock is ticking\u201d. Luca told them that was ok bc he was infertile. My mom goes so you won\u2019t give me proper grandkids?  She then goes and I quote, \u201cI have already accepted that my grandchild won\u2019t be pure with your genes now you say you can\u2019t have any at all\u201d. I blew up and asked what she meant by pure and that she was being completely disrespectful to us. Luca is Cuban and has a darker complexion which my family seems to find an issue with. I have come to find out they have been bad-mouthing us behind our backs. She said that we have never had a mixed child in the family. Luca then asks if we were to have a kid would they not love it bc it wouldn\u2019t be white? They called him rude for insinuating such a thing. I backed him up and said if we have kids or not is up to us and told them they were out of line. She also added that if we adopt we\u2019d ruin our family tree and it wouldn\u2019t be legit. I stood up and left with Luca, ending the conversation with you\u2019re all a bunch of f\\*cked up \\*ssholes. That night I received a text from my mom. She started by saying I was ungrateful and I am a disgrace to the family. Saying I should be ashamed of how I spoke to her and that she deserves an apology. She called me after I left her on read and said I am being brainwashed by Luca. She says she can arrange an artificial insemination with one of her friend's (white) sons. That I should want kids, especially now because I can stay home and raise them. I called her a lunatic and said she was a bitch. I called her a racist bitch who I am frankly ashamed to call my mother. She cried and hung up and I  received a text from dad saying I took it too far and I'm not allowed back in their home if I don't plead for their forgiveness and oblige by their standards.
