We were having dinner and the conversation over dinner was going well until my mom and gma brought up the conversation of marriage and kids. They asked when we planned to get married and we said it wasn\u2019t our main priority. Mind you we have just begun our careers and are not in a financial state to even consider a wedding. My mom's rebuttal to my statement was that she would cover any expenses, which also meant she would control everything, I said firmly no thank you we'll wait. They also discussed kids and said we\u2019d have to have them quickly because my \u201cfertile clock is ticking\u201d. Luca told them that was ok bc he was infertile. My mom goes so you won\u2019t give me proper grandkids?  She then goes and I quote, \u201cI have already accepted that my grandchild won\u2019t be pure with your genes now you say you can\u2019t have any at all\u201d. I blew up and asked what she meant by pure and that she was being completely disrespectful to us. Luca is Cuban and has a darker complexion which my family seems to find an issue with. I have come to find out they have been bad-mouthing us behind our backs. She said that we have never had a mixed child in the family. Luca then asks if we were to have a kid would they not love it bc it wouldn\u2019t be white? They called him rude for insinuating such a thing. I backed him up and said if we have kids or not is up to us and told them they were out of line. She also added that if we adopt we\u2019d ruin our family tree and it wouldn\u2019t be legit. I stood up and left with Luca, ending the conversation with you\u2019re all a bunch of f\\*cked up \\*ssholes. That night I received a text from my mom. She started by saying I was ungrateful and I am a disgrace to the family. Saying I should be ashamed of how I spoke to her and that she deserves an apology. She called me after I left her on read and said I am being brainwashed by Luca. She says she can arrange an artificial insemination with one of her friend's (white) sons. That I should want kids, especially now because I can stay home and raise them. I called her a lunatic and said she was a bitch. I called her a racist bitch who I am frankly ashamed to call my mother. She cried and hung up and I  received a text from dad saying I took it too far and I'm not allowed back in their home if I don't plead for their forgiveness and oblige by their standards.

So if I were in your shoes I would not just go NC with them but I would expose them to everyone they know about their true racist nature. Since they don't see anything wrong in their beliefs I figure they won't mind if everyone knew.", "Holy shit. \n\nWhat a GD dumpster fire. \n\nYour parents are out of their minds. \n\nNTA.", ">I'm not allowed back in their home if I don't plead for their forgiveness and oblige by their standards.\n\n\"Your proposal is acceptable.\"  \n\n\nNTA, and go NC", "NTA. I am very vocal on this subject: STOP PRESSURING PEOPLE TO HAVE CHILDREN. Look at how many people have kids that they don\u2019t want, or can\u2019t afford just because their family pushes them towards it. My mom was amazing. She supported my lack of interest in parenting. My brother gave her 2 - the first one 5 months after she passed. She was excited to be expecting one, but never expected us to do it FOR HER. And it was soul crushing when she didn\u2019t live long enough to be a gramma. And where do people get off thinking they have the superior genes anyways? My kids would have been blind old cat ladies who collect rocks. Oddly enough - that sums my niece up except for the old part. Seriously though - with the amount of kids that are just BORN because having children is what is expected, and those kids being in bad, neglectful or abusive situations and ending up in the foster system or on the streets, it\u2019s high time parents stop demanding procreation. Good for you if you choose yourselves. Good for you if you choose to take on a baby that NEEDS a home. Shame on your parents for putting the pressure and guilt on you for having none at all or adopting and \u201cruining\u201d the tree. And a BIG middle finger to them for being uppity that your man is not PURE. Your parents suck. I wish you and him all the best!", "This may be the strongest NTA case ever presented. You 100% behaved properly (and with amazing restraint) through that. I will echo others in saying it may be a good idea to consider your relationship with those family members and step back from them.", "NTA\u2026go no contact\u2026my father is a racist, he TRIED to tell me which race I could date. I stopped talking to him the moment I turned 17 and he gave gave up his custody rights to me when my parents divorce.", "NTA  and ffs go no contact with these narcissistic fucks.", "Wonder how they know that there has never been a 'mixed' child in the family. Who knows what 8 times great grandfather was up to? Some people of other races were able to pass as white so OP's parents may not be as 'pure' as they seem.", "NTA\n\nThis is so fucked up. Your family sounds 1 step away from being neo Nazi skinheads. \n\nThey are the clear assholes here for pushing the wedding idea they control. \n\nFor bad mouthing you behind your backs or not.\n\nFor pushing kids, which is none of their business. \n\nFor pushing it again and bringing race into it and \"purity\" on skin colour.\n\nFor pushing it again on breaking the family tree, as it's noones responsibility. But to do it over adoption which is a wonderful thing is ugly. \n\nArtificial insemination by someone you don't know when you already stated you want to be child free for now, and that offer on the basis of the donor being white....just....the stuff you hear about from Nazi bloodline purists and white supremacists.\n\nThey were trying to gaslight and manipulate you. These are just bad, bad people. \n\nPeople love saying \"but we're family\" and excusing bad behaviour, in this case though, your family is an anchor which will only bring you down. Cut the line and be free. No contact and your life will improve. \n\nThe only nice thing they did was banning you from visits until you apologize, coz you're never gonna do that(I hope), so they did you a favor making it easier. \n\nThey value your race and your breeding ability and nothing about you as a person is respected in any form, from your own autonomy, your personality, your financial planning, career and foresight or your choice of partners and how you live your life.", "\u201c\u2026arrange an artificial insemination with one of her white friend\u2019s sons\u2026\u201d Hahahaha how does she think that conversation would go.\n\n \u201cHey, do you want to get lunch this weekend? Oh, and can I have some of your son\u2019s sperm?\u201d \n\nNTA.", "OP, I am so sorry for you and Luca both. This must seem as if you have walked into the middle of a horror movie. Who are these people who raised you and professed to love and care for you?  Dad insists that you apologize to Mom who has offered to get you knocked up with a nice white baby.  It would take me a long while to think about resuming contact with them.  They have said some truly hideous things.", "OMGeeeez, how absolutely vile!  Please, listen to the commenters! Go low contact, with them, and reassess your relationship. If they keep insisting that you apologize, go no-contact.  \n\nNTA, at all.", "NTA.\n\nYour family treats you like a birthing vessel and not like a person... disgusting. Mum at least is racist on top of that. Even IF you should decide to have kids one day (whatever way possible) I would not let them in their life as your family is toxic...\n\nYou do not owe anyone kids/grandkids. If you do have them, than just because YOU BOTH want them (your partner and you obviously, not mum). \n\nGood luck and good on you for standing up for yourself and your boyfriend!", "NTA at all. Your \u201cfamily\u201d are racist, horrible people. And then turning it around to try and make you think that you own them an apology. Heck no! Don\u2019t apologize.", "That made me want to cry. My parents have seven mixed race grandkids and it makes no difference to them. You are so much NTA.", "It would be no contact for me. I don\u2019t associate with racists, be they blood relatives or strangers.", "Ditto this. I'd love grandkids, but told my kids that my desire is not their responsibility. It exists separately from them and is mine alone. \n\nTheir dad and I made our choice and they make theirs.", "It would kill them more if she did end up having beautiful children and posted photos of their happy new family", "She hasn\u2019t decided not to have children later, so that shouldn\u2019t happen unless she choose not to have kids later. A \u201dspite\u201d tubal ligation is probably not a good idea unless OP is certain she\u2019s never having kids.", "Sounds like OP already initiated NC by blocking them both. NTA", "It\u2019s like they say- if you have nine people and one Nazi at a dinner party\u2026 you have ten Nazis at a dinner party. \n\nI have racist family too, and I don\u2019t speak with them. Literally the last thing my cousin said to me was before I moved to South Korea when she cried and said \u201cI just feel like you\u2019re going to get killed over there!\u201d\n\nThat was 13 years ago. Good riddance. NTA, OP. Go NC for sure.", "I said she should just tell them that, as a f you to your bloodline. Not that she should actually do that", "Yeah same here, I don\u2019t speak to my grandmother and all of her minions because of this bs.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]"]}
