For a little context, Luca is infertile, and the chances of us having our kids are extremely low. I am well aware of this and it truly doesn\u2019t bother me. I have also never really wanted kids, especially at a young age. Luca and I are on the same page and we want to live our 20s free of the responsibilities kids bring.\n\nMy family on the other hand does not agree with our ways of thinking. I am an only child and the only one left to \u201ccontinue our bloodline\u201d - my dad\u2019s words. We were having dinner and the conversation over dinner was going well until my mom and gma brought up the conversation of marriage and kids. They asked when we planned to get married and we said it wasn\u2019t our main priority. Mind you we have just begun our careers and are not in a financial state to even consider a wedding. My mom's rebuttal to my statement was that she would cover any expenses, which also meant she would control everything, I said firmly no thank you we'll wait. They also discussed kids and said we\u2019d have to have them quickly because my \u201cfertile clock is ticking\u201d. Luca told them that was ok bc he was infertile. My mom goes so you won\u2019t give me proper grandkids?  She then goes and I quote, \u201cI have already accepted that my grandchild won\u2019t be pure with your genes now you say you can\u2019t have any at all\u201d. I blew up and asked what she meant by pure and that she was being completely disrespectful to us. Luca is Cuban and has a darker complexion which my family seems to find an issue with. I have come to find out they have been bad-mouthing us behind our backs. She said that we have never had a mixed child in the family. Luca then asks if we were to have a kid would they not love it bc it wouldn\u2019t be white? They called him rude for insinuating such a thing. I backed him up and said if we have kids or not is up to us and told them they were out of line. She also added that if we adopt we\u2019d ruin our family tree and it wouldn\u2019t be legit. I stood up and left with Luca, ending the conversation with you\u2019re all a bunch of f\\*cked up \\*ssholes. That night I received a text from my mom. She started by saying I was ungrateful and I am a disgrace to the family. Saying I should be ashamed of how I spoke to her and that she deserves an apology. She called me after I left her on read and said I am being brainwashed by Luca. She says she can arrange an artificial insemination with one of her friend's (white) sons. That I should want kids, especially now because I can stay home and raise them. I called her a lunatic and said she was a bitch. I called her a racist bitch who I am frankly ashamed to call my mother. She cried and hung up and I  received a text from dad saying I took it too far and I'm not allowed back in their home if I don't plead for their forgiveness and oblige by their standards. I replied fuck you and blocked them both. So, AITA?\n\nUpdate: \nFirst thank you for all the supportive advice and sweet words. I showed Luca the post and he sat there reading and dying at some of the responses he has never liked my family to be fair but put up with them for me. I\u2019d choose him over them any day of the week. We also informed his mom, whose English isn\u2019t the best so we had to translate it, and she said that I have a family with her and to forget about mine. She is the true definition of a good mother and has shown me more unconditional love then my mother has in my 22 years of life. She has even been teaching me Spanish and how to cook Cuban food, a light in this whole situation. I have gone completely NC with my family as of today. This incident occurred about a week ago. Luca and I have been looking for a place together and my family will not be knowing where that is. \nAn update on the situation: My cousin (moms side) who is a bitch (put nicely), seemed to have found my post and sent it to my parents and aunt. Frankly idgaf bc I kinda hoped they\u2019d see the comments. They told her to tell me I was being an entitled bitch and shouldn\u2019t add fuel to the fire. They said that what they said isn\u2019t wrong in their eyes and the comments made them cry (lol). They added to the, how could i disrespect them when they raised me to be who I am which is a load of bs. I am nothing like my parents thank god and learned to make my own choices as a teen. I told them I never want to see them again and if they want to apologize they would have to get on their knees and beg for it from Luca and myself. I would also never allow them into my life unless Luca is on board as well. (Not gonna happen). They went back to the marriage crap and started comparing me to their friends daughters who are housewives with good christian husbands raising family at my age while I\u2019m a whore who can\u2019t settle down. They claim our 5 year relationship is a scam because that\u2019s enough time to get married and make a commitment. My cousin said this is why no one in the family ever liked me, because I\u2019m the out cast (in this case it\u2019s a compliment). My cousin is a strong conservative who believes whatever her parents tell her. As soon as I had a mind of my own I never respected my parents beliefs which they hate me for. My cousin told me I was a traitor and to gth. I told her I just left hell and don\u2019t plan on going back lmfao.", "created_utc": 1673984863, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10elhph/aita_for_ruining_my_family_tree_and_making_my_mom/", "score": 796, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My kids would have been blind old cat ladies who collect rocks. Oddly enough - that sums my niece up except for the old part.

They didn't have an indoor toilet until my husband bought one & put it in for my mother in her house.  \n\nMy children are white, hispanic, black , comanche, navajo, and I'm pretty sure I'm forgetting something.  We run from almost fish belly white to dark black. If you add in the sons in laws & daughter in law we also have cuban, chinese, japanese more black, more hispanic, and again I'm forgetting something.  Oh! Nigerian naturalized American citizen.  Oh, indian from India not American Native Tribes.  \n\n\nMy family is stinking gorgeous. Amazingly beautiful. We look like an ad for coca cola singing to the world back in the 70's. We offend racists everywhere we go. We irritate all sorts of political lobbies and activist groups. And I don't care. This is MY family. Every shade of skin, every straight, curly, kinky, wavy, red, blonde, brunette, black hair on their heads. The grandchildren being born are gorgeous. Our family tree as turned into an incredibly beautiful vine that twists & turns all over the world.  And frankly anyone who doesn't like our variety can kiss my amazingly white rear end. We like each other, we love each other, we are 100% crazy about each other and as my football playing son in law said \"mess with my little mama's family and we'll throw down on you in 8 different languages\".  lol  I'm his little mama.  He's 6'7 & I'm 5'2\".  We're also various sizes.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've told you all of this so you'd know that yes you are correct. Your mama is a racist, your daddy is a bigot and Luca is your family.  Be loyal to your family. If anyone can not love your family then toss them.  We continued to support my mother financially & care for her physically till her death. But she was never allowed ever again to be around my children. Not the birth, step, adopted or fostered ones, not the white, brown, black, copper tones, gold shades or ANY of my children.  Some people have to be loved from a distance and not allowed input into your life.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you and Luca don't want children then you should not have them.  If you don't want them now but do in your 30's have them then.  If you want them in your 40's have kids then. If you think you can't have kids because Luca is infertile but y'all decide years from now you want kids...........I can assure you there are hundreds of thousands children praying every night someone will come and love them.  They are babies, toddlers, young kids, middle schoolers, high schoolers.  They are black, white, brown, golden, every shade skin comes in. They all need care & love.  And I can assure you that shooting one out of your hoohah doesn't make you love a child more than adopting one.  Skin doesn't have to match nor hair nor eyes only hearts need to open to each other.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you choose to keep your parent's influence a bare minimum because hate gives birth to hate and they will only birth more hate into your life unless they change their hearts.
