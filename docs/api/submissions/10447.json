Our child is 10 months and requires a lot of attention. We have a housekeeper that comes twice a week to deep clean the house, do laundry and cook for those days. I am 100% responsible for childcare and taking care of the house the rest of the time. My husband works 5 and a half days a week. It is a regular 9-5job. I pack him lunch and coffee as well as make breakfast and dinner. \n\nWhen my husband leaves work, he goes to the local bar and stays until 10pm. On Saturday, he leaves work around lunch time and does whatever interests him in the afternoon. He comes home late. On Sundays, he wakes up around midday and just lazes the rest of the afternoon away. Meanwhile I am always taking care of our baby. I am unhappy about him drinking every day when we don't have any savings. I have to scrimp and budget to make sure we are all fed while he blows thousands on drinking every month. I have to wait for the occasional freelance jobs I get to buy bigger things for our child. Like a high chair, stroller, car seat, food processor etc. \n\nWe have had huge fights about his drinking. I told him I feel lonely because I only see him and our housekeeper. He just wants to sleep when he comes home. We live far away from my friends and family. He has refused to move closer to them. Plus I feel like I have to beg him to spend more time with our son and me. \nThe other problem is that he doesn't communicate properly. I want him to call me if he is going to be later than usual during the weekdays. I genuinely want to know, is this controlling? \n\nI asked him to take care of our son for a few hours on Sunday so I can have a social life too. I have only seen my friends a handful of times since having a baby. Same with my family. He accused me of resenting him for having fun and want him to be miserable because I am miserable. I swear I have no idea how he reached this conclusion. I try to be clear and concise when I tell him my needs. Is this too much to ask? I just want some time free from the baby to meet my friends or get my hair done. \n\nI am on the verge of leaving him even though I am three months pregnant with our second child. The arguments are becoming more vulgar and below the belt. He has started insulting me personally and my family so much. He has broken two doors in the house and other furniture. He is so disrespectful and acts extreme. He starts shouting around our child. I love him with my whole being but the idea of my children seeing this unhealthy behavior while growing up terrifies me. Furthermore, I am becoming more like him as time goes by. You know the saying 'stupid people drag you down to their level then beat you with experience'. \n\nSo am I being controlling? Unreasonable? Should I leave?", "created_utc": 1676894502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1174wnb/aita_for_wanting_a_break_from_childcare_a_few/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you should leave him.\n\nThere's no delicate way to say this: what you're going through right now is considered domestic abuse. He's already verbally, emotionally, and financially abusing you.

Often they can advise you on the safest way to get out, and sometimes have legal advisors on board.

Contact a lawyer.", "NTA.\n\nrun. your husband is a typical abusive AH and it's just a matter of time until he lays hands on your. i think you're way too kind to be staying with him. the children you have are yours as much as they are his. i got even more angry seeing that you're three months pregnant with a 10 month old baby making him every morsel of food and drop of fluid going in and out of his body when he is a grown man, perfectly fine, having over 12 hours of a day to himself. he's a lazy a$$ who wants to reap the benefits of having a wife he expects to bend over backwards at all costs to make him comfortable. \n\nPLEASE. PLEASE!!! LEAVEEEE!!!!! DO NOT STAY WITH THIS MAN. if you have family or friends, contact them and let them know what he's doing. pretty pretty please.", "NTA - I think you need to get out of your situation at least for the moment. The two most dangerous times in an abusive relationship are the leaving, and during pregnancy. I think it would be a good idea to make a safe exit plan. Depending on your location, there usually local agencies that have resources to help.", "NTA. As others have said, this abuse!! And it\u2019s only going to get worse with the next child. You say you love him with your whole being\u2026 have you asked yourself why? You have described nothing positive about him. He wastes money on drinking, is insulting and cruel, doesn\u2019t care about your welfare, doesn\u2019t seem to care about his own child, is almost never home, manipulates your conversations to make you feel crazy, and provides no value to the family. He\u2019s not even paying for baby things if I\u2019m hearing that right! He doesn\u2019t seem to care about your or your kid at all. What exactly is there to love?", "This needs to be the top answer. You're married to an abusive alcoholic.", "Agreed! But first, start documenting EVERYTHING without him knowing. This will come in very useful in divorce and custody hearings, even if it is only your own well-documented and dated notes. Secretly record his verbal abuse, keep a calendar of when he\u2019s off drinking, how much time he actually spends with family, when he gets violent or yells.\n\nAlso, start squirreling away some emergency cash. Make sure you know all account numbers and passwords to bank accounts, credit cards, life insurance policies, and all other financials. If you can, set email notifications so you know when passwords or account information changes. \n\nThink carefully about your exit plan and how you will support yourself and your child once you leave, but don\u2019t let it get overwhelming or frustrating. That\u2019s not a reason to stay. If you ever feel the need to go back, only do it after he has made significant, lasting changes.", "Ikr! I honestly thought I was going crazy. I can't reason with him. Everyday is too much. I can't describe how he twists conversations.", "This. Don\u2019t have another child with this man, OP.

FFS.", "She stole his sperm and impregnated herself?", "Good for you that you have no idea what abuse looks like.", "What a callous response to someone obviously being abused. Educate yourself.", "Refuse to give relationship advice because she won't listen but you think being an insensitive jerk is going to get through? Or, do you just have an overwhelming need to be seen?", "All of this entire thread of comments! Plus gather important documents and leave them with a trusted friend. Birth certificates. Passports if you have them. Social security cards. Paperwork on any important assets. Etc. Also particularly sentimental items - photos, baby keepsakes, things from your family, etc.", "He twists conversations because he is manipulating you. You're feeling a very strange cognitive dissonance because you know that if this were happening to your best friend, you would tell her to leave as soon as she safely could. You know that from the outside, this relationship looks abusive. But from the inside, he's convinced you that you're being too demanding to ask him to spend two hours with his own child after 10 months.\n\nTo be clear, breaking a door during an argument is a serious anger issue and a threat that you should be grateful he hit the door instead of *you*. Please, please get yourself and your child somewhere safe.", "Manipulation is a sharpened tool used by all addicts, it will get to the stage where you are questioning the colour of the sky. The mental gymnastics of understanding an  addict will do nothing except crush your own mental health. \n\n\n\nGet out as soon and safely as you can, start building your case as he will use the children to play all sorts of games to continue harrassing you. \nIs there any way to safely record (check state laws)  his outbursts? Do you have witnesses? \nMake sure you have you and your childs documents in a safe  place. \n\nI am both the child of and ex partner of addicts, your children need you to get them out of the cahos of addiction, they also need at least one mentally and emotionally healthy parent, make sure you have a good support system to enable you to maintain your own mental health. \n\n\nSMART do an amazing  program just for the friends and family of addicts, i have completed it and can say it was so helpful in helping me deal with communicating with an addict, I wish i had known about it years ago. \n\n\n\nThere is nothing you can do to change him at this point, you also did not cause this, but it is only you that can decide  what you are willing to put up with and how much emotional damage you want to expose your children to. \nHim hitting rock bottom and accepting recovery  could be months, years, or never, but he can and will drag you down the spiral to rock bottom with him."]}
