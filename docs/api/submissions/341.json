My brother told me the skinny dog (let's call him Fido) was owned by a couple who are gone almost all the time and Fido was always stealing my brother's dog's food. He also only had water to drink because of my brother.  I witnessed this for myself for a few weeks and had enough. One day, I just put him in my car and took him home. He needs a lot of training. The vet says he's about a year old. His second year is going to be way better than his first. He gets to eat a lot now. He's joined my pack and seems very happy and I know he can feel the love he was missing. I don't know the circumstances of this couple and I'm truly sorry for hurting them, but this guy deserved better.

Pretty much for obvious reasons. Anyway I don't think you're terrible for taking the dog. The moment they stopped feeding it was the moment they stopped being their owner. I don't suggest you steal anything,  but what's done is done. I did shit like this when I was a kid, I once got into trouble because someone saw me, I had to learn to be sneakier ha. But I got over all of that as I grew up.", "NTA. Four legged and furry neglected. Give the best. When ask Oh I don't know what happened to your dog.", "YTA - I understand to an extent where you\u2019re coming from, but the couple still owns the dog. It may feel wrong leaving it behind, but you could possibly be criminally charged for this because it is still stealing.\n\nLook at it like this, if the dog was an actual baby being neglected, could you just pick up the kid and take them home without even asking for permission from their parents? No, because that would be kidnapping, which is essentially what you\u2019ve done.", "YTA.  You\u2019re also a thief.  If you want to rescue a dog, humane societies have many for foster and adoption.", "YTA for stealing a dog. You could have went to the owners to see if they would give and/or sell the dog to you. Nevertheless, what's done is done.  I'm over it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
