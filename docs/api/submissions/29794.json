Damn, what a mega asshole your sister is. And while I'm not victim-blaming, your family should employ a bit of extra caution; they seem awfully casual about the theft of your grandma's entire retirement. As for the rules enforced on you, I am sorry. It is totally unfair, and I'd usually recommend you to have a conversation with your parents, but with what they've went through it'd probably be best to just wait until you're 18 and become an adult.", "NTA. She did ruin the family. She stole from her parents and grandmother as well as you (money that could have fed you), and she thinks she can do that without harsh words? Hell, I would have loved to hear she had been jailed for her utter selfishness.", "If I\u2019m reading this correctly\u2026your sister (after petty theft in your house that should have been the first red flag) stole over $70,000 dollars. \n\nMom leaves you and the family hungry and needy so she can replace $30,000. Still,no police call. \n\n In fact,*nothing* changes and sister STILL has access to the money and (of course) steals it again. No cops again. \n\n They actually tell your sister to leave so she leaves,but abandons her son. Your parents shrug,take on raising their grandchild (in a house without any saved money) and start treating *you* like you\u2019re guilty of something. The family is totally fractured. \n\nPardon my linguistics,kid,but *what the flying fuck* is wrong with these people?!?!? After the house thefts,she should have maybe been given one more chance and then thrown out of the house THEN! After the first bank theft,she should have been *arrested*!! \n\n You are obviously NTA,but you are literally *surrounded* by idiotic,passive dimwits. My advice to you is to do very well in school,get any job you can,save every penny and get the hell out of that insane asylum ASAP. I\u2019m so sorry you were born into this,best of luck.", "YWNBTA - That\u2019s elder abuse.", "NTA. You're right, your sister did ruin everything! You have nothing to apologize for. \n\nI have a similar story & sorry it's a long one. My mom was on her deathbed, in the hospital for the last 6 months of her life and in and out of lucidity due to a blood infection that went to her brain. She lost her leg, had a tracheostomy and it was awful. When she died she was down to 69 lbs. Some days she knew us, some days she didn't. \n\nI lived in another state with my husband and kids which left my sister keeping track of things, I flew in as many weekends as I could. About 4 months into mom's stay she calls me and says she's missing $10,000. I kinda laughed it off mentally thinking my mom was always dirt poor, she wouldn't be any better off now having not been working. I said that to mom, said you couldn't possibly have that much money to steal. She got angry and said I was wrong so I called her boss who was an ex nun and a good friend to my mom. Turns out her boss (an angel, I know) had been paying her the whole time she was out sick!\n\nTo make this as short as possible, my mom & sister have the exact same name. Sister had taken mom's debit card and was siphoning off her money to buy diamond earrings, pay her car note, got her kids professionally photographed, new clothes for all  etc! I got power of attorney over my mom, my mom's boss was given permission by me to get all the bank statements. We had all the proof of sister's crimes. \n\nSo, I called my sister and asked how she could possibly steal from her dying mother. She said there must be a mixup, she must have gotten her debit card and mom's mixed up. I said great, then you should have $10,000 sitting in your bank account if you haven't been using your money. Of course she didn't. \n\nI was devastated, having to tell mom she was right and sis had been stealing from her. She said \"get me my money back\" she was so mad!There was no getting blood from a stone, sis simply didn't have $10,000 to replace it so sadly I couldn't get the money back to her before she died. \n\nMom passed 2 months later, I was shocked to find out she had a life insurance policy that amounted to each of us 5 kids getting exactly $10,000. Seemed like karma. I called a family meeting, had all the bank statements to back me up, told my siblings what had been happening. They were all shocked, of course. \n\nI said this is what's good to happen. We will each get $10,000 but sister's $10,000 will be used to pay for mom's funeral. She put on the water works and said this was so \"unfair\". I simply lost my mind on her and told her unfair was letting our mom die knowing her own daughter was so low she would steal from her,  not out of need but greed! And believe it or not some of my siblings actually sided with her ! I think because of grief and loss they just want to move on but I didn't care; I had made a promise to get my mom's money back and in a roundabout way I did. I made sure my sister didn't profit off my moms death. And no, we don't speak and have only spoken once since then. I can't fathom how people do things like this to their own family. So I'm sorry this happened to you, sadly I'm guessing stories like this are all too common.", "NTA. She put serious financial strain on the family and broke trust in multiple relationships, and she won't even say why. To tie into your household being Christian, she's guilty of pride for sure and avarice too.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour sister is an AH - but your mom is a major AH and a shitty parent.", "NTA but why would your sister have access to those bank accounts?", "Nta , and well, you need to get out of this mess. Yes she ruined your life. And its all your parents fault. After the first time, she should have been out. You just need to get out and leave shit show. Or the shitshow will never leave you.", "Your grandmother needs to have your sister charged criminally. It might be the only way any of you will have closure from this. I would put money on your sister being on drugs.\n\nI'm so sorry she pulled all of that. Go to your school guidance counselor and ask about free and reduced lunch. Tell them everything that is going on.\n\nGet an after school job at a restaurant so you can earn money and you can eat there. And, most importantly, sit down with your guidance counselor and plot a rock solid plan to go to college next year with good financial aid. You need advice from someone who can help you navigate that system. You deserve to have a bright future but you need to get far away from your family right now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
