I like Fortnite better, but he like GTA Online. No problem for me, I left Fortnite to play with him. There was even a time when I only entered Fortnite for half an hour (I usually play all afternoon) and the rest was just GTA.  And throughout the year, he would change games, he was in GTA, he went back to Fortnite, he went to another game, he went back to Fortnite, he played another game...\n Until July/August, it seemed that Fortnite didn't even exist for him (which was what I wanted to play with him) and he only played other things but we still talked.  Until in September he played with me a little, but now...\n There was once when we were playing together and he asked me to put on the skin he wanted me to put on.  I said no, he kicked me out of his party.  And there was another time when he simply said: \"Do you want to play with me? If not, get out of here\" I said that I wasn't going to play and that I wasn't going to leave and he left.\n Now, every time I talk to him, he's in a different game, and each game he says \"hey, do you know this game? Download and play with me\" and I never download because I want to stay in Fortnite and there's almost no storage on my PlayStation.  And now I'm tired of it, I want to be at peace in my game but he just doesn't accept it.  Now I have to be careful with everything I say so he doesn't get mad again.  Last time, November 1st, I left Fortnite to play with him until I got tired of the game and wanted to play something else, but I didn't have anything else to play with.  And in what I said: \"I can't stand playing this anymore, but there's nothing else for us to play together, only if you want to play Fortnite with me. And guess what... he told me: \"Oh, so go to your Fortnite, go, bye\" and left. And I'm already tired of him being like that, my mother says it's because he's only 10 years old but it doesn't justify it to me. And I really wanted to tell him that he has to stop being childish, but if I talk, he gets angry and the friendship ends right there.\n What should I do?  Do I speak or not?  And mostly, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1667598849, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymbm4c/aita_for_hardly_playing_with_my_friend/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

End of friendship.  He is only 10, doesn't know how to negotiate in a friendship yet.  He will learn.", "NTA - whatever you had together before it's gone. I am sorry to tell you that. The simple fact that he doesn't want to play with whatever you want is a sign he's done. I would try looking online, in your games, for more kids closer to your age that have the same or similar interests. Its time to let this kid go since he is no longer interested in playing with you.", "NTA. Just block him and find new friends. Play the games YOU want to play.", "NTA.\nYour mum is right, he's only little and he may even have autism or some other thing that makes it really hard for him to be flexible or compromise. \nYou didn't do anything wrong. Don't worry about it, just enjoy your gaming and you will meet other friends sooner or later.", "NAH.

You\u2019re 13 and he\u2019s 10. He does not have the same brain maturity as you. He is also still a child so he cannot be \u2018so childish\u2019.
