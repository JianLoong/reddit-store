She\u2019s your siblings caregiver, you\u2019re not. Your stepmom also should accept that your father is your primary parent, you\u2019re more comfortable going to him with matters that upset you.", "NTA.\n\nI don't think and well meaning or rational adult would try and stop you from talking to your parent. The fact that she's trying to guilt you for it is concerning.", "NTA. The nanny overstepped her authority, and your stepmom didn't put a stop to it, so what did she expect? \n\nI'm guessing that your stepmom was trying to keep any issues away from your dad so that she could keep the nanny that he wasn't too keen on. While I can understand that, she didn't fix the problem. Your dad did.", "NTA\n\nIf you're old enough to have a job,  you're too old to answer to a nanny. If your stepmother had handled that misunderstanding the first time,  this problem wouldn't have come up.\n\nAny adult who tells you not to discuss something with your parent/guardian is automatically in the wrong.  I told all of my neices and nephews before they were 6 that if anyone ever told them they shouldn't tell their parents something that they should either tell their parents right away or come tell me unless it was a \"good secret\" like a special present or surprise. I believe that advice holds true,  for the most part,  at any age.\n\nThere should be literally nothing you cannot bring to your dad... and does he know that your stepmother tried to tell you not to talk to him about this?  In my opinion,  she was WAY out of line to try to keep you from confiding in your father,  both because that's your dad & you can tell him whatever you want and because it was an obvious effort to prevent him from knowing what is going on in his own home and with regard to his kids, no less.", "NTA \nYou should be able to talk to your dad about anything you want \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it's your dad! Just talk to her and tell her you were just sharing things with your dad, and it's not a big deal!", "NTA\u2014 your dad is your dad. If you have issues, you should be able to go to him for anything and everything.\n\nThe nanny should have never questioned you either.", "NTA.  Your stepmother was well aware of the situation as your dad had spoken to her about it.  The ball was in her court to correct the nanny as to exactly who was to be nannied and you weren\u2019t one of them.  Either she failed to do so or the nanny was a control freak.", "NTA - you are allowed to talk to your dad about whatever you want. Your stepmom cannot stop you. That nanny deserved to be fired. Why does she think she has any say over you at all?", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to talk to your dad about anything. It's his home; he's your dad. Just be upfront and tell SM that you feel free to talk to your dad about anything, so please don't make a request against that, politely but firmly.", "NTA your step mom just sounds jealous for some reason of you seemingly being closer to your dad than your step mom.", "NTA you have every right to talk to your dad about anything at anytime.", "NTA -- it is never OK not to talk to your dad, nanny was a jerk.  She tried to have it both way, that you were not her charge, but she wanted to tell you what to do.", "NTA\n\nYour stepmom should never dictate when and how you speak to your actual parent. In fact, anytime she tries to tell you not to speak to your father, that is when you should DEFINITELY speak to him.", "Info: do you have a bad relationship with your stepmother?\n\nIt doesn't sound like she forbade you from talking to your dad, it sounds like she asked you to come to her with the issue since she is the one communicating with the nanny...which makes sense. Hearing secondhand from your dad may not give her the complete picture to confront the nanny and actually fix the problem. Who knows what he actually said to her? He could have just said \"OP thinks the nanny is too bossy\" which doesnt really convey how much the nanny overstepped. It doesn't sound like she castigated you over not coming to her with it, she was upset that the perceived bargain you guys made wasn't honored. Which sounds like a miscommunication to me where she thought it existed and you didn't. It doesn't make her an asshole for being upset if she's not mistreating you over it. It makes sense to go to her directly and telling one person doesn't mean you can't tell another. The only way I see it making sense that you exclusively went to your dad is if you don't have a good relationship with her.", "INFO: Were you unnecessarily antagonistic with the nanny? It's not clear from your post if you've been on a hair trigger \"I'M NOT A CHILD!!!!!\" hostile vibe or if she actually tried to insist on babysitting you as well. It's awkward for nannies to be in the house at the same time as older children or other relatives so usually everyone tries to be kind and navigate it with lots of flexibility and willingness to be cool.", "Stepmom sounds like Lady Tremaine. OP, you are NTA. Stepmom needs to chill out and realize that you talking to your dad is A) a good thing and B)probably an indicator that you don't feel like you can trust her.", "NAH - not enough info to say anyone was actually the asshole. I would not feel bad.", "Slight YTA\n\nThis is the equivalent of running to Yelp instead of letting the waiter fix things, or jumping straight to the principal over the teacher's head. Not fully assholish, but on the spectrum of it.\n\nI'm guessing your stepmom is mainly upset because getting your dad to agree to a nanny was an uphill battle, and she feels stabbed in the back and undermined that you tanked this for her without letting her try to fix it, or at least bridge your dad into trying a different nanny than this one. \n\nYou went with the nuclear option first, and you knew dad would be more than eager for any excuse to drop having the nanny. Stepmom now feels disrespected and infantalized that both of you made unilateral decisions about her household and her kids, without discussing it with her. She should have at least been involved in the conversation. It was pretty shitty of both you AND your dad (mostly your dad) to leave her out of it.\n\nI'm guessing your dad is now resistant to getting a new nanny, which isn't good because the reasons they had for needing one still exist.\n\nI'm also guessing that all of the tasks handled by the nanny have now been dumped on stepmom, along with a heaping scoop of your dad berating her for the nanny being a bad one, so she is not feeling all that charitable towards you.\n\nTo make this right, apologize for the outcome of the conversation with dad, but not for talking to dad, if that makes sense. \n\nThen help her convince your dad to hire a different, better nanny.", "NTA. You can talk to your dad. But you can talk to nannies too. She was new to the job and maybe just trying to learn the routines. Could she have just been mirroring your own attitude? Maybe you have the same attitude toward your stepmom?", "YTA but not for not giving your mom a chance to handle it.  You were right about everything until you told her it\u2019s your house and she should respect you.  It\u2019s not your house.  It\u2019s your parents house.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The younger person has every right to speak to their parent about an issue that makes them uncomfortable.  Stop do not advance to go do not collect $200.", "With the next nanny, suggest having a talk all together when she starts to go over expectations in terms of any communication between the two of you and anything else, such as whether she has to clean up after you if you are eating with them, whether she can ask you for help with anything, basic politeness, etc. Setting good boundaries and acknowledging the potential friction can help a lot. From there, just commit to not being involved in drama. Be nice to her and just handle it later with your stepmom or dad (it's not on you to navigate their relationship, talk to whichever you want or have a group chat if they can't manage themselves). I can guarantee you that most nannies are not interested in parenting you and cringe just as hard as you at having to interact.", "It\u2019s not more either of their house.  Zero is zero.", "Because she doesn\u2019t have to explain to the nanny where she was because she is not in charge of her only the young children so the nanny has no business asking her where she was.
