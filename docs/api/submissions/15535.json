I believe that advice holds true,  for the most part,  at any age.\n\nThere should be literally nothing you cannot bring to your dad... and does he know that your stepmother tried to tell you not to talk to him about this?  In my opinion,  she was WAY out of line to try to keep you from confiding in your father,  both because that's your dad & you can tell him whatever you want and because it was an obvious effort to prevent him from knowing what is going on in his own home and with regard to his kids, no less.", "NTA \nYou should be able to talk to your dad about anything you want \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it's your dad!

Hearing secondhand from your dad may not give her the complete picture to confront the nanny and actually fix the problem. Who knows what he actually said to her? He could have just said \"OP thinks the nanny is too bossy\" which doesnt really convey how much the nanny overstepped. It doesn't sound like she castigated you over not coming to her with it, she was upset that the perceived bargain you guys made wasn't honored. Which sounds like a miscommunication to me where she thought it existed and you didn't. It doesn't make her an asshole for being upset if she's not mistreating you over it. It makes sense to go to her directly and telling one person doesn't mean you can't tell another.

Stepmom now feels disrespected and infantalized that both of you made unilateral decisions about her household and her kids, without discussing it with her.

From there, just commit to not being involved in drama. Be nice to her and just handle it later with your stepmom or dad (it's not on you to navigate their relationship, talk to whichever you want or have a group chat if they can't manage themselves).

Big leaps are being taken.", "This ^^^^ you tell my niece not to tell her Dad then I will see you as nothing but a big red flag. It\u2019s so wrong.", "I mean, if being in the majority on a subreddit defined my life you could call it a loss. But it doesn't. Folks disagreeing with me isn't the heartbreak you seem to think it should be.", "Obviously the nanny doesn't work for OP, and the nanny's harassment of OP was uncalled for. I meant stepmom is the manager of the nanny, so I saw her request to hear about issues directly not about parenting OP but managing the nanny. But I get it's a minority view", "OP had requested the Nanny not address them already. \n\nIt\u2019s obvious the Step Mum wasn\u2019t managing the Nanny seeing as the Nanny CONTINUED to harass OP\n\nSo SM failed as an employer. OP got it sorted", "The nanny definitely needed to be fired.", "It's not even that long. You're just lazy, or lacking in reading skill, or embarrassed that you couldn't come up with a reasonable counter-argument and try to bypass it.", "Any step mother willing to tell you to not talk to your own dad is a poor excuse for a woman. Any reason for it is gross and immature. NTA", "NTA sounds like your dad believes your word over hers, and with good reason. This sounds like A+ parenting on his part, and some weird competition by the stepmom", "INFO: What is *\"I acknowledged what she said but didn't actually promise to do that.\"*\n\ni mean... if its like:\n\nSM: Next time talk to me.\n\nOP: Ok.\n\nThen Y T A.", "Info: how long has step mom been in your families life? You mentioned things were kind of awkward between you and her, is there a specific reason why is awkward? \n\nI still pretty strongly think NTA, being upset that you talked to your dad about something isn't ok & step mom cannot put that restriction on any of the children, that's y'all's father. Like, yeah, maybe dad does just go and talk to her about the concerns and she has to deal with it either way, but they really should be having conversations about the discomforts their children are having with a stranger in the house regardless of who is responsible for the stranger. That should be a both parent thing, especially if one parent felt uneasy about it to begin with.", "I don't get all these comments. I think this is a soft YTA. \n\nFrom the tone of your posts i don't get the idea that your stepmom asked you to keep a secret. She just asked you to tell her if there is an issue with the nanny. How is she supposed to fix it if you won't tell her? She asked you directly to tell her next time and you just ignored her. Of course she's upset and hurt.", "YTA -it\u2019s not your house. Respect goes both ways, you showed no respect for Stepmom or nanny. Going by your own words, you\u2019re a dreadful person. \nHave you thought of therapy rather than lashing out at people?", "NTA\n\nYou have walked into a political situation here where your stepmum wanted to employ someone that your dad wasn't keen on employing, and it sounds like he took the opportunity offered to get rid of her.\n\nIt's not your fault, this nanny overstepped her bounds, and your stepmum should have briefed her better. If you are old enough to work you don't need a nanny and your stepmum should have clarified who the nanny was responsible for and who she wasn't.", "NTA. When will people learn that respect goes both ways", "Wtf, how are people on this thread saying you\u2019re NTA. You def are in my opinion, you were very rude and disrespectful. Someone asking you where you were and you answer with mind your business!? You could have been mature, you could have spoken to your SM, but instead you snap at the nanny, who probably thinks she\u2019s just doing her job, worried about where you were etc. and then go to your dad once again, therefore causing him to feel frustrated with your SM and Nanny. It is very easy to be firm and polite, to someone even if they are in the wrong. Now your SM and siblings have no help because you were annoyed? I don\u2019t know how old you are, but if you\u2019re old enough for a se year job you should be more mature and be able to handle situations like this better I would think. I honestly feel like you\u2019re probably very disrespectful and daddy probably tends to spoil you a bit. And sounds like he might be controlling in their relationship and maybe there was a reason she wants to handle the nanny herself\u2026. We are only getting one side of the story.", "Yta\u2026 what\u2019s with your attitude?", "NTA. One parent should never tell a child (under 18) not to tell another something, unless it\u2019s about a surprise birthday party.", "Really? I got SM seems intimidated by dad because he can be controlling. We are only getting one side of the story and I bet SM had her reasons for requesting that of op", "Dad sounds controlling of Step mother to me. We aren\u2019t getting all the sides of the story. I wouldn\u2019t put those thoughts into OPs head of SM being toxic or red flags, she literally could be afraid of her husband. Wtf is wrong with ppl in these comments?!", "If someone is overstepping their boundaries with me and someone else is trying to paint over it, those instructions will not matter to me either. And Op sounds like someone who understands boundaries", "Is it OPs legal address? Because it sure as hell ain't the nannys", "I'm the weird auntie ;) and thank you.", "It was his stepmum who was disingenuous, telling him that the reason for bypassing his dad with feedback was because of \"efficiency\" when in fact it was because she was worried exactly this might happen.\n\nThe nanny was anything but efficient, wasting time bossing around a working age son of the house in some weird power play.", "This isn't a corporation. It's a stepmom trying to keep a child from communicating with his father as he wishes, likely as inappropriate damage control. He had no reason to cooperate with her attempt to force a familial chain of command, something that's suspect in and of itself.", "Mistakes were made. You didn\u2019t think your SM deserves to be talked to directly, your dad probably didn\u2019t give her enough info to properly deal with the nanny and SM didn\u2019t want to antagonize her needelessly. NTA for talking to your dad but consider this: it\u2019s always better to build bridges than to burn them. Don\u2019t freeze SM out.", "Agree. Step mom could have had good reasons to ask this of her. And she ignored after saying ok. Not only that but OP was RUDE AF. Just because someone asks you where you were you do not have to be rude and tell them to mind their business. Could easily have said \u201cI had work tonight, sorry if you were waiting; but I thought SM told you I wasn\u2019t part of your job? If she hasn\u2019t told you yet I will get her to confirm with you tonight/tomorrow\u201d like, how hard is that?", "We don\u2019t know stepmom was painting over because we have no idea what the dad told the stepmom op said", "Unless step mom is afraid of her controlling ass husband!? Like, has no one else thought of that scenario?!!", "Stepmom's reaction tells it all.", "\"*She told me it hurt her feelings I made an agreement with her but didn't honor it*\" this is called emotional manipulation and is wrong. \n\nNTA OP, talk to your father about this too.", "Did you even read the title?", "idt stepmom meant it in a \"keep a secret from dad\" way, more just to cut out the middle man. i think it really depends on how stepmom would have felt if op told both of them\u2013dad as a way to vent, and stepmom as a way to get the problem actually dealt with.", "It sounds like strep mom wouldn't have minded if OP had told her AND Dad. Dad, because that's OP's parent, step mom so she can address it with the nanny.", "No leap is necessary for NTA. Yes some people are making assumptions but plenty are not, and those should be the ones being upvoted.  That's why there is a set way to ask for more info, just because some people decide to jump to conclusions doesn't mean the whole subreddit functions that way.", "If stepmother didn't say that then why is she upset OP talked to Dad? I think you're just getting hung up with the wording. If youre learning to drive and youre told \"Go when the light turns green\" i think most people will understand that you don't go when the lights red. Even if no one tells you.", "Probably op\u2019s dad since it had the audacity to make small talk with the master\u2019s of the house.\n\nServants should not speak. /s", "I can\u2019t imagine you bothered to read it either if you think it was an unassailable point and not just someone saying they shouldn\u2019t have to make small talk with the help."]}
