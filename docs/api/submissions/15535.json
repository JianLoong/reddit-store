I believe that advice holds true,  for the most part,  at any age.\n\nThere should be literally nothing you cannot bring to your dad... and does he know that your stepmother tried to tell you not to talk to him about this?  In my opinion,  she was WAY out of line to try to keep you from confiding in your father,  both because that's your dad & you can tell him whatever you want and because it was an obvious effort to prevent him from knowing what is going on in his own home and with regard to his kids, no less.", "NTA \nYou should be able to talk to your dad about anything you want \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it's your dad!

Hearing secondhand from your dad may not give her the complete picture to confront the nanny and actually fix the problem. Who knows what he actually said to her? He could have just said \"OP thinks the nanny is too bossy\" which doesnt really convey how much the nanny overstepped. It doesn't sound like she castigated you over not coming to her with it, she was upset that the perceived bargain you guys made wasn't honored. Which sounds like a miscommunication to me where she thought it existed and you didn't. It doesn't make her an asshole for being upset if she's not mistreating you over it. It makes sense to go to her directly and telling one person doesn't mean you can't tell another.

Stepmom now feels disrespected and infantalized that both of you made unilateral decisions about her household and her kids, without discussing it with her.

It was pretty shitty of both you AND your dad (mostly your dad) to leave her out of it.\n\nI'm guessing your dad is now resistant to getting a new nanny, which isn't good because the reasons they had for needing one still exist.\n\nI'm also guessing that all of the tasks handled by the nanny have now been dumped on stepmom, along with a heaping scoop of your dad berating her for the nanny being a bad one, so she is not feeling all that charitable towards you.\n\nTo make this right, apologize for the outcome of the conversation with dad, but not for talking to dad, if that makes sense. \n\nThen help her convince your dad to hire a different, better nanny.", "NTA.

From there, just commit to not being involved in drama. Be nice to her and just handle it later with your stepmom or dad (it's not on you to navigate their relationship, talk to whichever you want or have a group chat if they can't manage themselves).
