{"id": 25359, "submission_id": "15z610y", "title": "AITA for asking my fianc\u00e9 to stop licking my face and respect my other boundaries?", "selftext": "Okay, the title might sound a little weird but I will explain. I (20f) and my fianc\u00e9 (24m) have recently gotten engaged and plan to marry next year in the summer. However, recently there have been some issues that could be potential red flags. Because we are in a long distance relationship (some 700 km or what removed from each other), we have periods where we don't see each other for a very long time, followed by periods where we live together (so see each other very intensely).\n\nI have never been very strong on the physical contact aspect and it took me some time to get used to my now fianc\u00e9 touching me or embracing me, though I enjoy it very much now for the most part. However, this summer I wasn't feeling very well (I had a lack of vitamin D as I've now found out, causing me to be super tired and emotional all the time). In his attempt to get a reaction out of me, both on the days I was feeling fine and not, my fianc\u00e9 started tickling me. I am very ticklish and I absolutely dislike it if it goes on for longer periods of time. I instantly get into a sort of panicked mode and I start screaming and yelling for him to stop. I try to push him off, but he is 6'4 and also much stronger than me, so it is a fight quickly over for me.\n\nOn one occasion he went even further and started licking my cheek, causing me to literally screech in disgust that he should get off and leave me alone, that I was overwhelmed and that I just needed five minutes for myself to shake the feeling (these are my go to sentences when he wants to cuddle when its too hot or when I just need some time for myself). Instead, he kept doing what he was doing and tickling me besides. I went as far as to use the safe word we usually reserve for other situations, but he replied 'not tonight, baby' in a joking voice. To be fair, I was laughing, crying and screaming because he was still tickling me, so maybe the message didn't come across, but I did try my best to push his face and hands away.\n\nWhen he finally stopped I told him seriously that I did not like this and that he shouldn't do it again, but he told me not to be such a poor sport and that it was one of his favourite things to hear me react like that. Besides, he told me I had been grumpy almost the entire holiday and he liked to hear me laugh and scream and act more lively. I will admit that I have been very emotional/grumpy/etc, but not on purpose and I don't think it's fair he uses this method, when I explicitly told him it makes me feel very stressed out in the moment. He told me in response that I shouldn't be such a party pooper and grinch.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I didn't expect to get so many reactions in such a short time, and also not of this nature. I just want to say that my fianc\u00e9 is a good man and this is the first time something like this has happened. I have voiced before, especially in the beginning of the relationship, that I'm not comfortable with touch and when he once put his hand on my leg and I told him it wasn't a 'vibe' which is my way of saying that I don't really like it, he immediately apologised and pulled his hand back. We both don't like tickling very much and sometimes I tickle him too, except for him it's of course easier to stop me. I just want to say that I don't think he is a bad guy, but I do appreciate your guy's advice (:", "created_utc": 1692802130, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15z610y/aita_for_asking_my_fianc\u00e9_to_stop_licking_my_face/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have a sit-down discussion with him and if it happens again get the fuck out of there, because he clearly has issues with consent.", "NTA- he doesn't respect your feelings.  Don't marry this person, people rarely improve their behavior.  Most get worse over time.  If he's doing this now imagine what he'll think is acceptable in 5 years.", "NTA. End the relationship now, for your own safety. You've already seen he'll disregard your safe word. And you asked him to stop doing something and he refused. MAJOR red flags!\n\nWhen I was younger, and people did the \"tickle you until you start to cry\" thing, I inadvertently found a way to get them to stop; I lost control of my bladder. After that, those particular people would not tickle me again.", "NTA. GET OUT of this relationship immediately. What you have described is domestic abuse. If you stay it will only get worse. \n\nHe likes to hear you beg him to stop. He gets excited by your pain and discomfort. He thinks he deserves to force you to act in the ways that please him, regardless of your feelings.\n\nThis is a casebook description of an abuser. Free yourself from him.", "NTA so he prioritizes his enjoyment over your right not to be touched or assaulted, over your not enjoying that interaction, over you telling him no and to stop, even using your safeword? \u201cNot tonight, baby\u201d? And no apology or anything? \n\nHe sounds one step away from a r*pist. Frankly he already has the mentality of one with what he showed there. Did his behaviour change like this after your engagement? Because if so, it sounds like things are going to change majorly if you get married. This story seriously concerns me that if it continues you\u2019re getting trapped. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been more concerned. \n\nFrankly, I wouldn\u2019t be able to marry someone who did that to me. Where I used a safeword and that still didn\u2019t stop them. \u201cNot tonight, baby\u201d so it\u2019s optional whether that safeword stops what it is supposed to stop? I would never be comfortable doing what that safeword is usually used for knowing that it\u2019s a guesswork if he\u2019ll actually stop. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be able to continue the relationship. He showed that he\u2019s unsafe and untrustworthy. People might think tickling and licking is harmless (I\u2019ve tickled and licked, but you know when it stops and to continue despite that\u2026) but it\u2019s not when it\u2019s a precursor boundary stomper, precursor to worse.", "Hearing you, while you feel unsafe, panicked, unpleasant, vulnerable, and disgusted, is one of his favorite things?  \n\nThat sends chills down my spine!  It\u2019s horrible! \n\nIn his own words, he told you he understood what he did, and it was intentional. He understood you didn\u2019t want it, but he thought he knew better. He thought you ***needed it***. ***You clearly communicated that you wanted him to stop***. He happily, intentionally, ***ignored your safe word***.\n\nYou deserve someone who loves and respects you. If your SO respected you, he would be incapable of doing what he did. You would not be overreacting if you broke up with him because he ignored consent during foreplay. \n\nYou are uncomfortable enough with his behavior to come her for opinions. You know, at a gut level, that something is very wrong. \n\nNTA \n\nPlease, ignore the suggestions that you should loosen up. They are ignoring the critical issue of consent.", "NTA i think you should put the brakes on marriage until he shows more respect on these boundaries. You aren\u2019t his toy.", "NTA. You are twenty, you guys have a long distance relationship and he can't even respect your basic boundaries because \"he likes it\". Put the brakes on the engagement for now.", "NTA.\n\nIf he can't accept or listen to these (very) basic boundaries, why do you want to be in a relationship with him?\n\nIt doesn't matter if you've been grumpy or emotional, he should still listen to you rather than continue to do something you've asked him not to. It's not difficult to not lick someone's face", "NTA. \n\nGet.  Out.", "If he could, my husband would be touching me at all times. He would wear me as a suit if he could. And after ten years of being with my cold, prickly ass, he always asks before he touches me. He backs off whenever I ask, and he would never waste any of the actual physical touch I give him on tickling me against my will. This is not about differing levels of physical communication, which can be worked with, this is him enjoying your discomfort and ignoring it when you talked to him about it. NTA but your husband is.", "NTA\n\nLet me ask you something. \n\nWhen you don't want sex, will he force you just because \"he loves you\"?\n\nThe boundaries exist for a reason. If he doesn't respect a small boundarie, why would he respect a big one?", "NTA and BIG red flag girl! \n\nThat is such a violation of consent, especially if you\u2019re at the point of using your safe word. Sometimes pushing a little when tickling someone is one thing, but the fact you have to repeat it so many times AND were crying, using safe word, etc. is not at all playful. \n\nThis is also a big red flag if you\u2019re planning to marry this man. Is he going to resort to this behavior every time you\u2019re going through something that\u2019s hard? If you hit a bout of depression in life, is he going to be someone that can help you and not hurt you (emotionally, mentally, etc.) \n\nDefinitely NTA and you need to have a serious discussion about boundaries and behaviors when a partner is not in a good headspace.", "What you described is very scary.  You told him you were in distress and HE LIKED IT?  Creepy as hell!  Watch out for this guy!", "NTA.  He is physically bigger and stronger than you, ignores you when you say stop, and responds with \u201cNot tonight, baby,\u201d when you try to use a safe word to get out of the situation?

This goes way beyond any kind of \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d to him actively ignoring you telling him \u201cno.\u201d", "There's a quote from Anna Kendrick somewhere about how she absolutely hated being tickled and broke up with her boyfriend at the time because he wouldn't stop tickling her. It's got to do with respecting boundaries. If someone tells you that they don't like when you do something to them, you stop doing it. Period. NTA", "NTA. Everybody has their boundaries. I mean, licking once or twice to have fun or some tickling just to annoy you might be ok, but just ignoring the advice and doing it repeatedly is wrong.", "oh hell no.  He needs to understand that just because the tickling makes you \"laugh\" does NOT mean you are having a good time.  If he continues anyway, it is abuse.

And sadly women often feel the rape is their fault because of their body\u2019s involuntary responses. \n\nHe has violated you. He enjoys violating you. He will not stop violating you. He will enjoy finding new and more violent & intense ways to violate you. \n\nPlease take this serious. He has never treated well enough to excuse even one act of violation.", "oh hell no.

One day I had had enough and really put up a fight which is when his true colors showed and he used his size to complet.y pin me. He had his knees on my wrists and groin across my chest and was tickling me non stop.  I was hyperventilating and screaming in pain because he had broken my arm.  This went on for 10 minutes, but he was enjoying my discomfort so much he was oblivious to my neighbors knocking and a cop broke down the door finally ending it.  As soon as I was up and had been taken to the hospital I had a serious conversation with a lady cop and a counselor who wanted me to press charges.   I didn\u2019t but I did get out.

When something like this happens you should have a conversation (after both of you have cooled off) about what each of you wanted in that interaction. Then, find some common ground.\n\nFor example, my wife is much more physical touch than I am, so I don't really like to cuddle, but I'll scratch her back while she falls asleep. You admit yourself that you've been grumpy, so maybe the conversation is about how to find a way to connect and have fun that you both enjoy.\n\nAlso, men generally struggle to communicate how they're feeling, so the tickle fight was his way of telling you that he missed laughing together and has felt a bit disconnected. I'm not saying he's in the right, but if you're going to get married it helps to understand where he struggles so you can work together to find ways to communicate these things more effectively.", "NTA.  Maybe he just really doesn't understand why you have these boundaries and why you have them.  Do you know why you have them so that you could be more clear about why it bothers you?  While I totally agree that he needs to accept the boundaries you have and if he refuses to then he isn't someone you want to spend your life with.  My husband used to tickle me all the time until I told him why it bothers me so much.  When we were kids my sister used to sit on me so I couldn't move and then tickle me mercilessly.  Once he understood why it bothered me he stopped.  My daughter is like you had has issues with being touched and has always been like that, especially with men.  She won't even let her dad hug her.  I am about the only one who can and occasionally her brother.  She has always had anxiety issues and I think people touching her makes her anxious and like her space is being invaded.  Sit down and have another discussion about it and maybe explain more of why it is so difficult for you and hopefully a better understanding of the situation will register.  If after you have had this discussion he is still doing those things, than yes this is a red flag, and you need to rethink things.  Someone who routinely gets enjoyment out of getting you upset is not the kind of person you want to spend the rest of your life with.", "How long have you been together? Is it the first time he wouldn't take no for an answer?", "Definitely NTA.\n\nI wonder, though, if a couple needs a safe word, aren't they tinkering with the boundaries anyway? It's got to be a razor's edge between far enough to be perfect, and too far. I'll never understand why people want to be hurt during sex, to the point where they need a safe word when it goes too far. I'm sure a licensed therapist has notebooks full of reasons for this, and most of the reasons can't be good.", "That's rape.", "**after hearing this i want to lick u**", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I (20f) and my fianc\u00e9 (24m) have recently gotten engaged and plan to marry next year in the summer. However, recently there have been some issues that could be potential red flags. Because we are in a long distance relationship (some 700 km or what removed from each other), we have periods where we don't see each other for a very long time, followed by periods where we live together (so see each other very intensely).\n\nI have never been very strong on the physical contact aspect and it took me some time to get used to my now fianc\u00e9 touching me or embracing me, though I enjoy it very much now for the most part. However, this summer I wasn't feeling very well (I had a lack of vitamin D as I've now found out, causing me to be super tired and emotional all the time). In his attempt to get a reaction out of me, both on the days I was feeling fine and not, my fianc\u00e9 started tickling me. I am very ticklish and I absolutely dislike it if it goes on for longer periods of time. I instantly get into a sort of panicked mode and I start screaming and yelling for him to stop. I try to push him off, but he is 6'4 and also much stronger than me, so it is a fight quickly over for me. \n\nOn one occasion he went even further and started licking my cheek, causing me to literally screech in disgust that he should get off and leave me alone, that I was overwhelmed and that I just needed five minutes for myself to shake the feeling (these are my go to sentences when he wants to cuddle when its too hot or when I just need some time for myself). Instead, he kept doing what he was doing and tickling me besides. I went as far as to use the safe word we usually reserve for other situations, but he replied 'not tonight, baby' in a joking voice. To be fair, I was laughing, crying and screaming because he was still tickling me, so maybe the message didn't come across, but I did try my best to push his face and hands away. \n\nWhen he finally stopped I told him seriously that I did not like this and that he shouldn't do it again, but he told me not to be such a poor sport and that it was one of his favourite things to hear me react like that. Besides, he told me I had been grumpy almost the entire holiday and he liked to hear me laugh and scream and act more lively. I will admit that I have been very emotional/grumpy/etc, but not on purpose and I don't think it's fair he uses this method, when I explicitly told him it makes me feel very stressed out in the moment. He told me in response that I shouldn't be such a party pooper and grinch. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA, _huge_ red flag. Please have a serious discussion with him about this and think hard about if you really want to marry a person who does not respect you or your boundaries. It was tickling now, but this can turn into a much, much bigger and more serious problem. Please put yourself first.", "NTA - my ex used to do this and I hated it. I am funny about my personal space and things like someone licking my face just completely gives me the ick. And tickling also sends me into a panic which he used to do as well as *constantly* smacking my bum despite several attempts to tell him to stop. You\u2019re not the AH for asking him to stop and you\u2019re not the AH for acting how you did.", "NTA- I hate that shit. Tickling makes me so angry.. I may be laughing but I\u2019m furious. It makes me cry. I hate it. Licking the face? Disgusting. Like wtf.", "You'll be back in a year asking basically the same question.", "Asshole? No. Need to break this off? Yes. Don't be an idiot.", "NTA For him to keep tickling you when you've asked him to stop AND used the safe word is borderline abusive. He clearly doesn't respect your boundaries. The face licking is just gross. My bf did that to me once, and I was SO grossed out. Definite red flags.", "I'm gunna say NTA in the situation cause your feeling and boundaries are yours and that should be respected.... but I will also say you shouldn't be engaged... you guys are strangers and obviously don't know each other.", "NTA. That is disgusting. Tell him to stop licking your face and tickling. If he can\u2019t do that then no wedding. Seriously. Wtf?", "NTA. He may not realize it, but that's assault and coercion. I wouldn't hold it against him for the first time but if it continued I'd be outta there. If he isn't willing to stop it will only get worse.", "NTA. Your response that he's a good guy doesn't sit well with the following: \n\nthat when you said no,\n\n when you begged, \n\nwhen you cried, \n\nwhen you physically fought and were physically reminded of the size difference between you two and that you sounded like you were wondering if you were unsafe, \n\nwhen you panicked, \n\nand when you finally used your safeword and he actively said that even your emergency safeword wasn't going to be respected, \n\nlet alone when you said you *did NOT* like something and he said his perception of your being happy was more important than you actually enjoying yourself? \n\nOP, I would take this as something to keep in my back pocket for awareness at the very least. If this doesn't change your perception of him, especially while you are several hundred kilometers away from home, not sure what else to say. Take care.", "I don't think the OP should bother having a sit down. \"When people show you who they are, believe them.\" OP should get out now.", "OP literally DID sit him down and express how much she hates what he did and that she doesn\u2019t want him to do it again.  He not only dismissed her, he flat out told her he LIKES her panicked reaction!!!  This is a get the hell out now situation.", "NTA and totally agree. It got to the point she used a safe word and he just ignored it.", "And he didn\u2019t respect her safe word either. Big red flag", "Exactly. Ignoring a \"safe word\" is just the beginning.", "Oh, I can practically guarantee that OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9e has assaulted women in previous relationships if this is his attitude towards consent.  He just hasn\u2019t done it to OP \u2026 YET.", "That disgusted me as well. OP, this guy gets off on your displeasure. That\u2019s what criminals do. \n\nThe fact that he is that much larger than you should make him extra careful of not overstepping boundaries and if he loved you he would never want to make you feel uncomfortable. \n\nThese aren\u2019t potential red flags. This is the real deal. This guy is an abuser. This is how it starts but not how it ends. \n\nI\u2019m glad you don\u2019t live with him. Now love yourself enough to break it off. You deserve better.", "OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9 explicitly ignores her boundaries, ignored her freaking SAFE WORD, and told her he LIKES her panicked reaction when he refuses to stop tickling her!!  This is 100% a break up ASAP situation.  He has explicitly expressed that he does not respect consent, and this WILL continue to escalate.", "The tickling is assault.", "Agree, that's been my experience when hearing similar comments from friends; the relationship ends up becoming abusive.\n\nI was shocked to read Carole King's autobio and learn she'd been in an abusive relationship. She wrote something like \"I never thought I'd be an abused woman \u2014 until I became one.\" One day her BF slugged her for no reason. He was oh so apologetic afterwards, and it was the first time he'd done anything like that, so she stayed with him. Guess what? It didn't stop. She did leave him eventually.", "No dude. When someone says stop you stop. It\u2019s not complicated.", "Yes, this is the first time. To be fair, it was kind of a joke too, I think. We had watched Braveheart the night before and there is this one scene where the girl gets pushed down by a soldier who wants to rape her (or so we assumed) and he licks her face, so that's where it came from. I think it was meant as an innocent joke and that he does not have real bad intentions.", "I like giving relationships that are otherwise healthy the benefit of the doubt, but you're probably correct in this case. If it escalates it could be very dangerous.", "Not just ignored it, mocked it.", "This is assault", "Holy crap are you serious? Wtf is wrong with people on this thread.. I also think a lot of you really haven't been in real relationships or possibly were all just abused or something and aren't normal, healthy people. For Christ's sakes, in a tickle fight.. sometimes it goes too far. And I have been the recipient and the giver of \"too far\". You just have a conversation about it later after everything calms down, and let them know that you didn't like it and you don't want them to do that next time. For real though y'all be trippin. That's how you establish healthy boundaries.. communication, don't be a weirdo and just run away. If this dude showed any other red flags about being a psychopath, I might take this seriously.. but he doesn't.", "I mean, he definitely made a mistake by not stopping as soon as he should have, but that doesn't make him TA. If anything, the worst thing he did was get defensive about it when she brought it up after the fact. But again, people get defensive all the time and don't communicate well. If you're going to break up with someone the first time they make a mistake and get defensive about it instead of looping back to the conversation and trying to get clarity, then you'll never have a relationship that lasts for any length of time. Everyone downvoting me either isn't married or has married a saint.", "Oh honey.  That's the same type of thinking sharee by every abuse survivor in the beginning.  \n\nThis man IS abusive. You just dont see it yet. \n\nMay all the gods help you.", "Your guy is imitating behavior from a RAPE scene, however \u201cmild\u201d- and admitted to you that he enjoys your disgust and panicked reactions. This isn\u2019t innocent or a joke. He\u2019s also gaslighting you in regards to claiming you\u2019re grumpy/moody (even if you were- ask yourself WHY) and claiming to use \u201cjokes\u201d to liven you up. I think you need to distance yourself again for a while and seriously reconsider this engagement.", "Someone ignoring a safe word is a major red flag.", "They had a conversation after and he blew her off completely as being \u201cgrumpy\u201d and to not be a poor sport.", "Yes he does show red flags. \n\nThey had that conversation after everything calmed down. \n\nHis reaction was not an apology for going too far in the moment, or for ignoring her safeword. Instead he chose to shame her for disliking being tickled, and explicitly tell her that he liked seeing her struggling and made uncomfortable by him.", "She used a SAFE word.  Maybe you arent familiar with concept that's a stop immediately situation. \n\nThings didn't just get out of hand and go too far.  He CHOSE to ignore her boundaries. \n\nMaybe you're just too inexperienced to understand the difference but you're the one not getting it here.", "It wasn't a matter of going \"too far.\" They actually have a safe word, and he ignored it. Any responsible person will tell you that if the person you play with ignores your safe word, you break it off with them immediately.", "Funny, I told my husband that I don\u2019t like being tickled so he\u2019s never tickled me. It\u2019s not rocket science. Only a guy who\u2019s never been physically overpowered thinks the way you do.", "Not stopping when someone uses a safeword is pretty clearcut AH behavior", "Correct. Speaking from experience. Abuse is not just hitting. But this sounds exactly like the kind of behavior that can later escalate to actual physical violence.", "This is exactly the moment all benefit of the doubt was thrown out the window and he fully showed his complete disregard for not just his partners boundaries, but also her consent. There is a reason it is called a \"safe\" word.\n\nOP needs to sit him down and explain how fucked up ignoring the safe word was. Do not let him touch you in any way before he fully acknowledges, with full remorse, how badly he messed up there, and he promises to NEVER ignore the safe word again.", "yo yall absolutely crazy, one wrong thing and FUCK IT DROP HIM!!! like what the fuck?", "If by \"thinks the way you do\" you mean \"admits fault and seeks to resolve conflict through effective communication\" then I'm fine with that. Also, you have no idea about whether or not I've ever been \"physically overpowered\", but it's a fair point, and one that OP should bring up with her boyfriend when they're communicating effectively. Enjoy the view from atop your soapbox.", "I don't really understand how safe words work. If you are having rough sex, and your safe word is \"Asparagus\" is the other person allowed to continue their rough play even if you scream things like \"Stop\" and \"You're hurting me\" and \"I do not consent to this?\" Is there an agreement that anything other than the safe word is just role-playing and you should continue with what you are doing? I'd be freaking out if I heard some of those comments, even if they weren't the safe word.", "Ignoring a safe word is dangerous. \n\nAlso this:  \n\n\n\"he told me not to be such a poor sport and that it was one of his favourite things to hear me react like that. Besides, he told me I had been grumpy almost the entire holiday and he liked to hear me laugh and scream and act more lively.\"\n\nIn other words, \"If you're not behaving how I want you to, I will MAKE you do so whether you like it or not.\"\n\nUm, no thanks.\n\nSame goes for physical abuse. You hit me one time, even if it's only \"one thing,\" that's it, I'm gone.", "Its so there is zero ambiguity about what is meant. Someone saying \"stop\" could be said/interpreted in a playful way or \"you're hurting me\" could be part of some kind of roleplay or bdsm punishment. The safeword takes away all possible misinterpretations and is a very clear \"emergency stop, do not continue, consent has been revoked, this is not part of the roleplay\" \n\nLike in the example of OP, her saying \"stop\" could maybe if we give her partner the benefit of the doubt be interpreted as playful, since she was laughing from the tickling. The safeword was a clear sign that she was not being playful at all and was actually really not doing okay, even though she was laughing.", "The reason we have a safe word is because one time when we were making out, my fianc\u00e9 asked me to push him away and resist him. So afterwards, we decided we needed a safe word in case I would ever really mean it.", "Generally if you're doing something that could have you yelling \"stop!\" When you really want to keep going, you've already discussed it.", "And when you did use that safeword, he ignored it, shamed you for expressing your dislike of the activity/him ignoring your safeword, and explicitly told you that he likes it when you struggle.\n\nThis is not the reaction of a good man.", "So he has a non-consent kink and now ignored your actual real life call that what he was doing was not consentual? This kinda sounds like he is testing for with how much actual non-roleplay non-consent he can get away with. This could be a very awful slippery slope OP. Be very careful with this guy. My alarmbells are ringing max volume reading this.", "And then he ignored it. Oof. I really don't like this for you."]}
