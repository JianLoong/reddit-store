It's way out in the country, surrounded by farms, and Abbotsford's bus system isn't the best. If I landed in Abbotsford and was told I was supposed to be in Vancouver, I'd be frantic.

That'd be a what, 15 minute flight maybe?", "I honestly can\u2019t image a worse time to pull a prank than during travel. It\u2019s so stressful and anxiety inducing on its own, a prank is just unnecessary.

Once I get that hit of adrenaline or cortisol or whatever, I can\u2019t go back to normal.
