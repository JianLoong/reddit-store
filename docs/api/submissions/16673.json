That'd be a what, 15 minute flight maybe?", "I honestly can\u2019t image a worse time to pull a prank than during travel. It\u2019s so stressful and anxiety inducing on its own, a prank is just unnecessary.

Once I get that hit of adrenaline or cortisol or whatever, I can\u2019t go back to normal.

Ops friend wasn't even off the plane. If ops friend has a checked bag they'd beat ops friend to the pickup point.", "Exactly. I also find travelling extremely stressful. Not the holiday itself but anything to do with airports. My friends know that and would never do that shit to me. We still have banter, I can take other jokes, even jokes about my anxiety. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m a snowflake who can\u2019t take a joke as the \u201ccontroversial\u201d comments suggest. But why would I want to be friends with people who think it\u2019s funny to make me feel like shit?", "Yeah, keep in mind it's also two hours on public transport between the two, or an hour driving. \n\nThen realize that they're still on the plane so at least 15 minutes before being ready to leave, possibly closer to an hour, and this is a perfectly harmless joke.", "Yeaaaah, based on this response you might be the AH friend", "You're doing a lot of gymnastics to excuse these mean-spirited actions.\n\nThis whole \"prank\" was based on a bunch of guys laughing at someone\u2019s distress until he *realized* they were lying, not the kind of harmless kind of prank buddies might share with each other.\n\nWas that the funny part? The cruelty?", "Ok but if a friend didn't receive a prank well then it's time to apologize. Not everyone has the same standards or humour.", "No I\u2019m just not a dickwad that would blow my load over a 20second joke."]}
