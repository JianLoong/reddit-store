I finally had enough and told her I'm finished and will eat meat to both improve my health and because I am tirelessly bullied by friends and classmates about it (if they know). The argument started with me telling her I ate chicken in culinary class which then propelled her to show me multiple videos of cow slaughter and telling me that I am killing animals with my conscience. She also said that it is up to me and other people like her to show the world that senseless killing is not the way. I tell her that it's extremely unfair to push something so life-changing as vegetarianism from the age of literally 0 to the point of having health problems potentially because of it. She essentially says she doesn't care and proceeds to guilt trip me further by saying the chicken might as well be a dog. I'm definitely on the edge at this point and call her a fuckwad (which admittedly is extreme) but it's literally my entire lifetime of rage and sometimes pain put into this argument. She then tells me that our relationship is ruined and she doesn't care if I hate her forever.

Industrial farming is absolutely an atrocity, however the bottom line of that problem is not the fact that people eat meat it's that we've become reliant on grocery stores to provide it.

Tell her you don't want this to be something that looms over your adult relationship with her, that you are afraid all time spent with her post-vegetarianism will be spent with her looking down on you for choices you are entitled to make and you want a mother that loves you unconditionally and respects your boundaries and independence, not one that looks at you like some enemy of her cause.

He changed his mind after about a week, which was fine. That your mom isn't allowing a 17 YO this basic level of bodily autonomy is appalling.", "Where is your father in all of this? You mentioned \"parents\" in another comment so he seems to be around. Can you go to him for support?", "That\u2019s the same with any food though. Eating meat doesn\u2019t make you overweight. Eating too many calories, beyond what you\u2019re burning, is what causes weight gain. That can happen on a vegan diet, and you can lose weight on a meat diet.", "Too much meat don't make you overweight. Too much FOOD makes you. I know a obese vegan (ahs she knows it, she is trying to fix it for her health). Fries and oreos are vegan. There are other unhealthy vegan food.", "I was twenty, poor and discovered a health problem via a diet change. I wasn't stupid, but you're definitely just an asshole. Which you seem to think all teenagers are, but it's just you.\n\nGrow up and out of it.", "This is so incorrect. Many meats are lean. Meat is high in protein, which both curbs your hunger compared to carbs and your body burns more calories just by digesting it. I've literally lost 115 lbs on a high protein diet primarily consisting of chicken, fish, and lean beef. Eating your meat first also fills you up faster so you don't overconsume the rest of what's on your plate.", "It seems pretty clear that the mom is not buying calorie-dense nutritious food.  She has food restrictions and justifies it by claiming vegetarianism. The fact that she\u2019s ready to end her relationship with her child demonstrates that she clearly has disordered thinking around food.  The kid needs more food, and since the mom centers her obsession around \u201cvegetarianism\u201d, the kid thinks the answer is meat.  There are calorie-dense vegetarian foods, certainly, but mom may have burned that option by making vegetarianism look like starvation.", "As someone with severe anemia - the iron you get from plants is not nearly as absorbable as the iron from meats. And you have to eat a lot more of it. Same with protein unless the OP is eating a ton of bean lentils & nuts but even so unless those are sprouted they are actually really hard on your body to properly digest. A lot of people don\u2019t know that and so they aren\u2019t typically prepared in a manner that makes is easier on your system and to more easily absorb the goodness they have.", "You're the AH", "\"The unlawful killing of a human being with malice and premeditation aforethought\" if I remember it correctly from a law class like 20+ years ago.", "And I said she doesn't need much.  Is that misinformation?  Because according to you, eating too much would make her overweight.   So what's your point?", "I'm going to quote myself \"too much meat is how you get overweight\"  and the OP wants to eat \"meat\".  Context.  You just proved my point.", "As in my response to the other person.  This person hasn't had meat in their entire life.  They aren't jacked.  They aren't going to be able to just start going hog wild on meat.  Your body only takes from meat what it needs and stores the rest as fat.  Hear it from a football-hockey-collegiate rugby athlete.   I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to OP.   If she just starts eating meat, too much of it, her liver will convert excess into triglycerides wayyyy faster than someone who's been eating it their whole life, doesn't have health problems, etc.  You're taking my comment to her out of context.", "You can eat the leanest steak on planet earth, but if your body doesn't need the protein from it, you liver will store it as energy.  It has nothing to do with how fatty it is.  It's about what your body needs.", "It sounds like you\u2019re not feeling satiated by the meals you\u2019re being served at home and your mother isn\u2019t listening. As a growing teenager, even if you\u2019re in a normal weight range, you need more calories than an adult and there\u2019s no need for you to be eating low fat foods. Proteins in meat help you feel satiated for longer, which is probably why you\u2019re craving it. You may just need to eat meat outside of home when you can get it and not tell her about it. Lying to parents isn\u2019t a great practice, but when they\u2019re slightly unhinged it becomes a necessity. I wonder if your mum actually has a disordered relationship with food. She sounds a little obsessive with this.", "Perhaps what you and your mother need to do is talk to a good dietitian about how to address your nutritional deficiencies in ways that work for both of you. Which can be done without eating meat, if that is the sticking point for your mum. Then both the range and amount of food can be addressed and hopefully lead to better outcomes for you.\n\n In a year or two you can strike out on your own and do your own thing with food. In the meantime you can slip in a meat based meal when you're out with your mates.", "15 years ago i ate lots of Tofu for say 6 months and eventually realised for a gymn and cycling 90kg male it wasnt enough. Simple. Fast forward 15 years oats for breakfast   keep a banana handy, chicken burger or fish or burger with mince pattie dinner. More pasta also for big carbo intake. Lots of milk too. 1 litre a day+", "Explain your opinion if you want anyone to consider what you say you need to give something more than a base level of what you think", "I'll quote you, too, kid: \"Don't be an idiot.\"", "I cannot take something without context out of it. You didn't say ANY of this in your comment. So, next time, try to elaborate instead of just write short statements hoping people will understand you.", ">I wonder if your mum actually has a disordered relationship with food. She sounds a little obsessive with this.\n\nI agree.", "Dietician is the only option. It is not possible for OP to list everything she eats and how much. It is also not possible to diagnose nutrient deficiency without detailed information and no training, certainly not on reddit", "Just a random Reddit stranger with a small note: I'd be careful about cow or \"wheat\" milk. I was at a seminar about gut health and we learnt there that wheat and cow milk are not good for your gut if eaten too much. Just something that might be worth putting a little research into just to make sure your gut is healthy.", "Because clearly OP is still stuck under his mothers thumb and wants to avoid conflict as much as possible.   I haven't read what reactions she gives if OP were to ask for larger portions, but with the info I have read so far, it seems like the mom has some form of disordered eating habits. It's possible that OP asking for more could be interpreted wrongly by his mom and cause conflict as well.", "Ugh stop. Every human body is slightly different. So while MOST people can get all the protein and nutrients they need from a vegetarian diet if they do it right, there are *outliers* who cannot. Full grown adults who do their research and eat all the right things but because of how their body is they need the nutrients to come from meat in order to absorb them. And regardless of whether OP *could* potentially fix their deficiencies with the right vegetarian additions to their diet, the kid wants to eat meat! And is old enough to decide for themselves what kind of diet they want to follow."]}
