I tell her that it's extremely unfair to push something so life-changing as vegetarianism from the age of literally 0 to the point of having health problems potentially because of it. She essentially says she doesn't care and proceeds to guilt trip me further by saying the chicken might as well be a dog. I'm definitely on the edge at this point and call her a fuckwad (which admittedly is extreme) but it's literally my entire lifetime of rage and sometimes pain put into this argument.

She also tries to be semi vegan which typically means vegan cheese and fake butter (I can't believe it's not butter or whatever it is)", "They mentioned that meat has the nutrients that I am missing, mostly red meat. She was there. The doctor recommended special supplements but she does not want to get them based on cost which is BS since we are upper middle class and don't really have to worry about money (thankfully). It just boggles my mind that she is given the solution and says nuh uh no thanks too expensive. It's crazy", "Lord knows. She said that we are on a strict diet to show the world that she are better than the meat eaters. Her words, not mine. She will not deviate from this to help her son.", "A serving of tofu has around 10% of the daily recommended fat and about 30% of the daily recommended iron. The two things you've noted deficiencies in. \n\nFake butter is still full of fats. Salads can have a lot of healthy fat, fiber, and protein depending on what's in them.\n\nSo I'm still unclear on where the problem is. Are you eating restrictively small portions?", "Well, then, NTA.  \n\nI have celiac disease combined with multiple food allergies.  I take supplements to make up for what I miss (especially calcium, D3, and B12).  They are expensive but I figure my health is worth it.\n\nSo that's what I would suggest to you.  Frame the need for supplements on your doctor's orders.  Tell your mother she has a choice:  either she buys what you need or you resort to eating meat. Be forewarned:  ultimatums should only be issued if you plan to carry them out.", "She also stated cost as a reason at the doctor but to me privately it's due to her morals.", "Portions are small yes. What do you want me to tell you? Do you want me to prove my deficiencies? I've never said that it's for sure the result of vegetarianism but it is definitely at the top. At the very least the small portions play into my weight.", "Humans need proteins from plants and meat. \nThe plant based animal proteins, fat and fiber are not the same as the real things.\n\nThe problem that you are not seeing is that an person haste ability to critical think and make informed decisions,not just blindly follow some bull that people spew.", "What part of what you've read here makes you think OPs mom gives a shit?", "I want to know why at 17 you're solely accepting the portion sizes given and not asking for more. Or asking actively for her to get you certain foods, since you apparently know what would help.\n\nThe vegetarian issue is a moral one, and she shouldn't be forcing her morals on you. But the dietary deficiency is an issue that can and should be solved REGARDLESS of you eating meat. So I think it's disingenuous to blame that on your mom unless she literally refuses to buy vegetarian items that would fix the deficiencies you have.", "Having a vegetarian diet is not a moral issue.  It's a poor personal choice that goes against the very nature of humans. \nHumans have survived on BOTH, meat and veggies. \nA person that consumes only veggies or only meat will have deficiencies that will effect their health.  \n\nI agree that her diet deficiencies should be solved. But it can not be solved by solely plant based."]}
