For an emergency or a one-off \u201cshit I need more diapers can you stay here while kid naps?\u201d sure fine. But their kid = their responsibility. \n\nThat said, if you knew a child was going to strain things, it seems like you had ample time to make other arrangements and find a new place to live (or take over and help your friends find somewhere new). You sticking around once they got pregnant is tacitly accepting life with a baby under the roof, even if not your responsibility. \n\nAlso, hopefully you\u2019re not flat-out refusing to help at all times; that just seems like more of a bad friend.

Best for everyone to cut it off and set your boundaries, and offer support from a distance as friends.

The other couple may not have wanted to have kids when they agreed to a childfree living arrangement, but clearly they do now -- and that's okay. You and your wife's desires and preferences have not changed -- which is also okay. I think it's admirable you two offered your help despite not wanting kids around, and it's also natural that these new parents want extra help watching the kid because hey, babies are a lot of effort!
