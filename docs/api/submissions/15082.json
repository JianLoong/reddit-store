But they can insist they no longer will. The parents can always leave if they no longer like the living arrangements but they will still have the problem of taking care of the baby. Not likely they will have more children in the immediate future, if they can't handle just the one.", "Yes, but they lose the comfort level of renting out to people they already know. New renters, new problems. Unfortunately, the people they knew overstepped boundaries.", "I don\u2019t think we can speak about a \u2018comfort level\u2019 when a newborn is in the mix and one party is staunchly child free. I\u2019m not defending the friends here, but it doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to see how this was a subpar setup from the get-go. Babies make ungodly amounts of noise, create messes, have to be constantly accommodated. If you are clear enough in your intentions to tell a couple not to get pregnant while sharing a flat with you and then they have a child, you don\u2019t invite said child into your new home. They really need to ask their friends to move out. This is a car crash waiting to happen.", "NTA but this was inevitable- parents are always going to try to guilt trip the nearest person into 'giving them a break'. You were totally upfront about 'never' and they pushed and pushed and pushed. Check it out with a lawyer then evict them, no guilt, no regret. They moved into YOUR house and flat out ignored every boundary you put down. I could not tolerate living around that screeching sound, you're a saint for not throwing her out the microsecond that pregnancy test came up positive.", "NTA and time to find a new living arrangement.", "NTA \n\nTime to be an adult and communicate. Tell them you aren\u2019t their babysitter and if they leave their child, you are calling CPS on them. Or evict them. Either way the friendship y\u2019all have might be over.", "NTA!

And when the accidental pregnancy then loss happened, the couple went through a lot of pain and wanted to try again on purpose. They had the baby in September and OP got a house in December to move oht. OP is a softy with slack boundaries who also wanted rent payments, so he allowed them to move in with them. I may be wrong and that the original apartment was OP\u2019s too. I hope they update with info.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with you setting boundaries here. If they don\u2019t like them (or don\u2019t comply with them), you can terminate their tenancy.", "For sure. That is completely inappropriate. If he\u2019s tossing you the monitor and leaving, he\u2019s being very rude and not even asking. Sounds like maybe this friendship has run its course.", "They're waking you up to take care of the baby while he leaves to go to the store??? You need to cut that off NOW, even if you have to threaten to call the cops for child abandonment if he walks out the door without his kid. He isn't treating you like a friend or a family member, unless he treats everyone shittily. You're not his FREE on-call nanny. With the break they're getting in housing costs by living with you, agreeing to watch the child (for free) when he regards your services with such disdain (waking you up, tossing the monitor), you're practically *paying him* for the privilege of babysitting.\n\nEdit: accidentally sent before finished", "WHY the hades did you let them FOLLOW you to your home AFTER they had a baby????\n\nThat was your first mistake.

But I wanted to ask, has he at all tried? Or is he saying it\u2019s hard to get as an excuse to never try? You usually have to go through a few rounds of it before it gets approved. I hope he\u2019s proactively trying to. I\u2019m on my second round.", "In the new house it has been 4-5 months, but yeah, they'll need a lawyer since they'll be upset over losing their \"live-in babysitters.\" NTA.", "Yup. You can\u2019t tell people \u201cDon\u2019t have a baby.\u201d You can say, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to live with a baby so if you have one, we will move out.\u201d But not only did OP not move out, he bought a house and invited them to stay so now he can\u2019t just leave. Mistakes were made, dude. You need to separate your living situation as soon as feasibly possible. And in the future, if you don\u2019t want to live with a baby, don\u2019t invite a baby to live in your house."]}
