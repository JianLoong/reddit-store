The child isn't going to go away,  it's very hard to ignore a child that needs attention, and if they see you are being inconsiderate and unhelpful, and you see them as using you, none of you are likely to be happy and you're all starting to resent each other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd suggest that you make looking for alternative living accommodation a priority.", "NTA.   \n\n\nParticularly since you do help on occasion.  It's time for you to move out though, for your own health.", "That\u2019s not what you said above though. Here you\u2019re saying you bought a house and let them move in for mortgage assistance. Above you say it\u2019s a small 2 bedroom apartment. Which is it?\n\nI promise I\u2019m not trying to troll, it is just really confusing. If you can clarify, it would help us all out.", "NTA at all. They are taking advantage of you. Gently tell them that you love them but child care of any kind is a boundary for you. They will probably be upset, but you have nothing to apologize for. \n\nINFO: can you uncouple from the housing arrangement? It might be worth losing the roommates to keep the friends.", "NTA - but maybe move out? its only gonna get worse as the kid gets older.", "NTA. You and wife need to move out ASAP. In the meantime, you both need to put your feet down on this. Make it abundantly clear that neither you nor wife will watch the kid anymore, and you will both be conveniently unavailable any time they need him to be watched. Start spending a lot of time out of the house, visiting other people or going shopping or something.", "ESH, for different reasons. Roommates shouldn\u2019t expect you to watch their kid. For an emergency or a one-off \u201cshit I need more diapers can you stay here while kid naps?\u201d sure fine. But their kid = their responsibility. \n\nThat said, if you knew a child was going to strain things, it seems like you had ample time to make other arrangements and find a new place to live (or take over and help your friends find somewhere new). You sticking around once they got pregnant is tacitly accepting life with a baby under the roof, even if not your responsibility. \n\nAlso, hopefully you\u2019re not flat-out refusing to help at all times; that just seems like more of a bad friend. Even before I had kids, if I had a friend or family member struggling in the moment, I\u2019d help with things. Babies are rough. Compassion is free.", "A tough situation which I'm going to call a complex ESH. Reasoning: for the specific situation you're referencing (the roommates expecting you to watch their kid), NTA. But for trying to dictate when your roommates can and can't have kids \u2013 and I say that as a fellow childfree human who avoids being around kids when it's at all possible, and has very intentionally changed exactly zero diapers in his life \u2013  YTA.", "~~\u201cWhen we moved in, we told them we didn\u2019t want them to have a baby while living with us because we don\u2019t like children\u201d~~\n\n~~What a profound choice of words. After reading this sentence alone, YTA. You and your partner do not have the right to tell your \u201cfamily\u201d they can\u2019t procreate because YOU don\u2019t like or want kids. That\u2019s their decision whenever they feel like they are ready to make it.~~\n\nNow including the rest of the information from this post, obviously the smart choice here would have been to move out by the time the child arrived, assuming that you knew they were trying. \n\nAll that being said, I would say ESH as they have started taking advantage of your help and you seem to enable them. Best for everyone to cut it off and set your boundaries, and offer support from a distance as friends. Maybe help find a replacement nanny or suggest their immediate family help with the kid.\n\nEdit- now that I\u2019ve read the comments I\u2019ve learned that OP has since moved and offered to let the friends stay as a kind gesture. NTA as they are definitely taking advantage of the situation. Apologies for the mixup.", "I'm inclined to go with NAH because desires change and life choices change. The other couple may not have wanted to have kids when they agreed to a childfree living arrangement, but clearly they do now -- and that's okay. You and your wife's desires and preferences have not changed -- which is also okay. I think it's admirable you two offered your help despite not wanting kids around, and it's also natural that these new parents want extra help watching the kid because hey, babies are a lot of effort! But this is the point where each of you need to find new living arrangements because clearly this isn't going to be a happy arrangement for anyone involved.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
