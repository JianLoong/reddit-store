I found out that she was also attempting to convince my now husband to cheat on me with her. He didn\u2019t take the bait, but we did have a discussion about the hurt caused by not being upfront. I also outed her affair to the girlfriend of the man involved.\n\nWe worked through it and made the decision that she was not welcome in our lives in any capacity and in my hurt and anger, had a serious confrontation with her. I was harsh, but certainly didn\u2019t threaten her. Unfortunately, she used this as fuel to play the victim to anyone who would listen. It fell on deaf ears for most, but there were two new girlfriends in our group that she managed to win over before I had met them. \n\nI am now on a friendly level with the two gfs, but keep them at a distance.

Her boyfriend forgave her for all the cheating and even came back around to being friends with the man she had an affair with which feels absolutely absurd to me, but others see it as the problem being solved and we should all just move on.\n\nI feel like after three years of reprieve, I\u2019m back at square one.\n\nIf I continue to hold my ground, I fear losing the connection to our whole social circle because of it.

You\u2019ll either have to learn how to block her out when you\u2019re at these events (mentally and physically, as much as possible), or accept that you won\u2019t be going to as many, if any, and my lose a lot of those friends because of it. That\u2019s a choice only you can make.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t sound like a great person to be around. Kinda surprised she\u2019s still part of the friend group considering how many times she lied and cheated.", "NTA\n\nDo the other friends in the social group know about her terrible behavior? If they do and they still keep her around I would think twice about the kind of people they are. This is a healthy boundary you have set. If they do not respect it then maybe it is time to find new friends.", "NTA. She sounds destructive. You know what's right for you.", "NTA. She sounds like a self-destructive narcissist. The fact that she has a history of seeming to enjoy blowing up other people\u2019s relationships (including an attempt on your own) maintaining a friendly relationship with her would probably be like trying to maintain a relationship with Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019d keep the two GFs at arm\u2019s length. They don\u2019t seem to respect your boundaries and if/when that bomb explodes in their faces, there will be collateral damage.", "NTA. But it may be a good idea to reevaluate your friendship with those two girlfriends if they are downplaying your boundaries", "NTA. Find new friends.", "NTA. If your social circle wants her around, you need a more discerning social circle.", "It was hard to provide all the context and timeline with the character count, but for reference the affair confession/short-lived friendship breakdown happened in late 2019. I haven\u2019t spoken a word to her since early 2020, including when she arrived uninvited to a recent event. My boundary setting was going very well until that event.", "I don\u2019t mind not going if she\u2019s there. I\u2019m less of a party person anyway, so if they choose to invite her 9 times out of 10, that\u2019s totally fine. I just don\u2019t want to be blindsided by not knowing if she\u2019s going to show up or be there when I walk in on the occasion that I get the invite.", "That part is extremely disappointing to me as well. At first, almost everyone was horrified by her actions/had been personally hurt by her, but she\u2019s always down for a good time and people seem to have short memories, it seems.", "Some do and choose to stay away from her, but will tolerate being in the same vicinity if they have to because they weren\u2019t as personally hurt as I was. Some have their head in the sand and seem to fear the idea that she may have already interfered in their relationships, so they just ignore the situation and choose to be cordial. Some have entered the friend group post-2020 so they don\u2019t have as strong an opinion.\n\nIn a more general sense, I find it baffling that anyone would want someone like this around, but being the loudest dissenting voice is harder in practice than in theory.", "why are you friends with the friends of your stalker tho?", "Idk this group, but this tells me they\u2019re not worth keeping around. Prioritize yourself and your well-being. She\u2019s not worth the nonsense. You might lose this group, but I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s anything to cry over.", "yep. you need new friends. \n\nNTA on other things", "Why can't you make new friends or just hang out with the people you want to in one-on-one settings?\n\nThe people in the group have told you they no longer want to accommodate your request of separate hang outs. While that's annoying for you, you need to adjust your expectations of how close you are to them and widen your social circle and change your social habit. If this person is as bad as you say, it's unfathomable you'd even want your social circles to interject. ESH", "NTA, but throw away that whole friends group.  They're drama-loving trash if they willingly keep her around.", "NTA. Your friends are her apologists at best and her flying monkeys at worst. I'm sorry.", "You can forgive people without wanting anything to do with them. The problem is explaining to folks that you forgive them, you don\u2019t hate them, but you do not want to associate with them outside of what you absolutely have to without them getting super offended.", "They want front-row seats to the shit-show that is this woman's love life. OP is harshing their squee.", "Yikes.   Watch out for your pet rabbbit.  NTA.", "Why should this woman be in your lives? I don\u00b4t get it... she was with your husband just 9 months (on and off). And I assume they don\u00b4t have any children together...   \nShe is in the friends group or what?", "I would wait it out.  She is gonna sleep with someone else's husband again soon and then it will be easier to ban her.\n\nI would keep an extra close eye on any of the guys who want her back in the group though.", "She has been in the friend group for a long time, yes. Many of these people went to high school together, but I did not. My now husband and all the people in this friend group were strangers to me until we started dating. After everything blew up with her affair in 2019, she was effectively removed from the friend group but saw an opportunity with the two new girls who started dating men in the group shortly after this all happened. \n\nShe\u2019s uncannily good at winning over some people, at least for awhile. I don\u2019t know how she does it. I\u2019ve warned people that getting close to her is a bad decision for their own relationship, but you can\u2019t control what everyone chooses to do.", "Did you save screenshots of everything she did ? Then get a protection order against her. If she appears she violates the order and will face the music. It will also show the so called friends it's not 'nothing' \n\nOr just distance yourself from the 'friends' close to her and find other people. There are a number.of them out there. NTA  they can judge after they deliver it and even then they don't get to decide how you need to act or feel", "They aren\u2019t my good friends, but just trying to keep the friend group peace by not being the \u201cdifficult\u201d person that never wants to go to anything. Setting the boundary that I don\u2019t want to be invited if she is already gave me anxiety that I would never get the invite, so when I do, I feel like I should take the opportunity. I have lots of other friends outside of this, but fully extricating ourselves from my husband\u2019s longtime friend group is a bit of a challenge.", "Yes, I have lots. I thus far have just used them in the rare but annoying occasion that she manages to convince someone that I made this all up and that I\u2019m the bad guy, but that doesn\u2019t happen often anymore. I did consider taking legal action when she was doing weekly drivebys of our house, but that has since stopped and the heightened drama has cooled down considerably. If it ever heats up again and she starts doing things that freak me out, I 100% will.", "As I read through the comments, your boundaries were being respected and you kept them up until this latest event.\n\nWhen at this most recent event, when you saw her, you and your husband either should have immediately left or make sure that she was iced out whenever she approached you or your husband.\n\nThe host / hostess of the event disrespected you.  They are not your friends. \n\nMaybe find some friends outside of this circle?", "You really CANNOT ask them to never invite other person.\n\nYou CAN ask them to TELL you if they invite other person--then you can choose not to be there.  Other choices are to walk out(with husband) if she is there.  \n\nOR GREY ROCK her if she is there.  OR just be really snarky if she tries to speak to you.  *\"Talk to the hand\"*.  or \"*Thanks but I don't speak to people who try to F\\*ck my husband WHILE he's my husband.\"*  Yes, you say it loud enough for others to hear!", "Slowly slowly catchy monkey, OP\n\nOne of the contributors said that you should not allow her to get into your head and let her dictate your life. I agree.\n\nYour boundaries and morality are without question but, given the circumstances in which you find yourself, the only option you currently have to completely ignore her is to avoid all the individuals in your shared social group. Only you know if this is a price you are willing to pay.\n\nOn the plus side, she is a serial shagger and she will, sooner or later, f\\*ck up again, very likely by f\\*cking the husband/boyfriend/partner of one of the very people who are currently sneering at you. \n\nPersonally, I would want to wait around for this to happen just so I can smirk at the cheated partner until my face fell off but you seem like a much nicer person than me.\n\nSo, as I said earlier, slowly slowly catchy monkey. Everything comes to those who wait.\n\nNTA, by the way.", "I'd be seriously checking out these two GF's boyfriends/husbands and see how much attention she's giving them LOL  Just for when the fireworks start over her cheating with them LOL", "Yes, that\u2019s accurate. My husband wasn\u2019t there unfortunately, and I had more of a physical anxiety reaction than I thought I would, so I ended up separating myself by one floor in the house and arranged a way home (I had been drinking and she arrived quite late in the night).", "I don\u2019t mind not going if she\u2019s there. I\u2019m less of a party person anyway, so if they choose to invite her 9 times out of 10, that\u2019s totally fine. I just don\u2019t want to be blindsided by not knowing if she\u2019s going to show up or be there when I walk in on the occasion that I get the invite.", ">That part is extremely disappointing to me as well.\n\nSo now you have to ask yourself, \"are these people I want to keep associating with\". They have shown you who they truly are, are they worth being your friend, or is it time to move on.", "Why isn\u2019t your bf standing up to you? He\u2019s the one who was privately texting her", "NTA. If these are primarily your husband's, at least initially, long time friend group, he needs to be the one fighting for both of you. He needs to tell them that HE won't tolerate her presence anymore because she displays manipulative, destructive, narcissistic, and psychotic behavior that no one should tolerate. Don't let him say that he's doing so for you and thus making you the \"bad guy\". He should already feel this way as your partner, and he should be enforcing this boundary.", "He does. He happened to be working away during this specific incident so he wasn\u2019t there, but he has made it known to his friends that he\u2019s on my side and he always ensures that we can leave/skip an event if I feel uncomfortable. Perhaps him not physically being there is one of the reasons that they decided to let her attendance slide, as annoying as that feels to me."]}
