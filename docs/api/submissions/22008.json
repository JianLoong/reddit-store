I found out that she was also attempting to convince my now husband to cheat on me with her. He didn\u2019t take the bait, but we did have a discussion about the hurt caused by not being upfront.

I was harsh, but certainly didn\u2019t threaten her. Unfortunately, she used this as fuel to play the victim to anyone who would listen.

Her boyfriend forgave her for all the cheating and even came back around to being friends with the man she had an affair with which feels absolutely absurd to me, but others see it as the problem being solved and we should all just move on.\n\nI feel like after three years of reprieve, I\u2019m back at square one.\n\nIf I continue to hold my ground, I fear losing the connection to our whole social circle because of it.

You\u2019ll either have to learn how to block her out when you\u2019re at these events (mentally and physically, as much as possible), or accept that you won\u2019t be going to as many, if any, and my lose a lot of those friends because of it. That\u2019s a choice only you can make.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t sound like a great person to be around. Kinda surprised she\u2019s still part of the friend group considering how many times she lied and cheated.", "NTA\n\nDo the other friends in the social group know about her terrible behavior? If they do and they still keep her around I would think twice about the kind of people they are. This is a healthy boundary you have set. If they do not respect it then maybe it is time to find new friends.", "NTA. She sounds destructive. You know what's right for you.", "NTA. She sounds like a self-destructive narcissist. The fact that she has a history of seeming to enjoy blowing up other people\u2019s relationships (including an attempt on your own) maintaining a friendly relationship with her would probably be like trying to maintain a relationship with Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019d keep the two GFs at arm\u2019s length. They don\u2019t seem to respect your boundaries and if/when that bomb explodes in their faces, there will be collateral damage.", "NTA. But it may be a good idea to reevaluate your friendship with those two girlfriends if they are downplaying your boundaries", "NTA. Find new friends.", "NTA. If your social circle wants her around, you need a more discerning social circle.", "It was hard to provide all the context and timeline with the character count, but for reference the affair confession/short-lived friendship breakdown happened in late 2019. I haven\u2019t spoken a word to her since early 2020, including when she arrived uninvited to a recent event. My boundary setting was going very well until that event.", "I don\u2019t mind not going if she\u2019s there. I\u2019m less of a party person anyway, so if they choose to invite her 9 times out of 10, that\u2019s totally fine. I just don\u2019t want to be blindsided by not knowing if she\u2019s going to show up or be there when I walk in on the occasion that I get the invite.", "That part is extremely disappointing to me as well. At first, almost everyone was horrified by her actions/had been personally hurt by her, but she\u2019s always down for a good time and people seem to have short memories, it seems.", "Some do and choose to stay away from her, but will tolerate being in the same vicinity if they have to because they weren\u2019t as personally hurt as I was. Some have their head in the sand and seem to fear the idea that she may have already interfered in their relationships, so they just ignore the situation and choose to be cordial. Some have entered the friend group post-2020 so they don\u2019t have as strong an opinion.\n\nIn a more general sense, I find it baffling that anyone would want someone like this around, but being the loudest dissenting voice is harder in practice than in theory.", "why are you friends with the friends of your stalker tho?", "Idk this group, but this tells me they\u2019re not worth keeping around. Prioritize yourself and your well-being. She\u2019s not worth the nonsense. You might lose this group, but I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s anything to cry over.", "yep. you need new friends. \n\nNTA on other things"]}
