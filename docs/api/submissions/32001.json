Because the team has a lot of projects that need to be completed and i am leaving which gives them more on their plate. \n2.

And you should probably speak to the HR director and let them know you resigned 2 weeks ago, but you're not sure whether they have been made aware of this.\n\nDo a proper handover of your projects and leave without any regrets.\n\nNTA at all.", "Definitely NTA. Let HR know yourself that you gave a month's notice to your manager with a specific date and let them know what form of communication you used.  You owe them nothing. Find another job in your field and ask about their training process when interviewing. Hopefully, you can find something with better management that won't throw a million projects they never taught you to do. You deserve better. Good luck.", "NTA and some bridges are worth burning", "NTA.\n\nYou are **not a slave**. You are allowed to quit for any reason. You gave plenty of notice. \n\nThe fact that your manager didn't tell HR is not your fault. Also, to be clear, you are **not** the one burning bridges. You gave proper notice. Your manager is burning bridges by not doing his job, which includes informing HR.", "You try to give them a month, they didn't want you to leave. They said that your manager didn't tell HR. Well go to HR and tell them. And if you want to give them two more weeks, go ahead if not leave.\n\nIf you're not on the contract you are a at-will employee which means they can fire you at any time without penalty and you can leave anytime without penalty. So leave, you will find another job just remember that if you use them for a reference remind people that if they bad Matthew you can actually Sue.\n\nNta, good luck job hunting", "If you are leaving, just work until your last day and stop worrying about the company. NTA. You are an employee - not property. This isn't working out for you. And that's why most of us have jobs - so that we can get what we need out of life. Its not just so we can be whatever someone else needs.\n\nNo one gives you notice when they fire you. So, have no guilt about walking away after giving a month's heads up.", "NTA, but your manager is.  CYA if you want to by reaching out to the director that you had informed the manager of your departure and they did not take any actions.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGonna be honest, the place you're working sounds awful, and it's a good thing you're leaving. I would not recommend talking shit about them though.  You never know who knows who etc.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
