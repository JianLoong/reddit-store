You have a responsibility to your job and you agreed to work those hours. I don't care if your boss leaves early. That's something that should be taken up with his/her boss. If the new guy has closing issues, why not take the time to show him how it's done? You'll be noticed for being a team player. \n\nYou cannot ask your co-workers if you can leave early! That is a decision to be made by your supervisor or boss. You can't leave on your own either. You can get fired for that. Since your boss already said no, leaving would be an automatic firing for insubordination.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your coworkers may say yes just to be non-confrontational, even if it leaves them in a bad position."]}
