{"id": 23332, "submission_id": "15bxmnu", "title": "AITA for refusing to DD anymore and leaving three drunk friends stranded?", "selftext": "I (F) have 3 friends from college, Maisy, Tom, and Neela. We're all mid-30s now. We usually get together once a month to have dinner despite work and family obligations (virtually during the global event). Six months ago, I had to stand up to everyone about splitting the bill evenly because everyone else orders and eats appetizers and desserts, and everyone else drink copious amounts of alcohol every time we get together. I typically eat a main and drink water. I started checking menus in advance and only bringing enough cash to cover my bill plus tip and would \"forget\" my card at home and eventually sternly told them that I was no longer willing to pay an additional $50-$100 every time we went out to cover their appetizers, desserts, and drinking habits.\n\nWell, they all decided because I wasn't drinking anything but water, I should be the DD, which I initially agreed to because I was just happy that they eventually stopped arguing with me about splitting the bill. But at the time I told them firmly if any of them ever threw up in my car, that would be the end of it.\n\nLast month, Tom nearly threw up in my car. The only reason he didn't is because I pulled over and pulled him out of the car and onto the pavement instead. I sent a group text the next morning stating that I was no longer going to DD, and everyone complained that Tom only ALMOST threw up in my car. I again refused and told them that next month, they either had to limit their drinking so they could drive, or they had to find their own ride.\n\nLast weekend, I reminded everyone I wasn't driving anyone home. No one limited their intake at ALL, and by the end of the night, they were too drunk to even handle paying their bill. I went up and asked for my bill separately, paid, and walked out without saying goodbye. Tom's wife had to have her mother watch their two kids while she had to come down, cover their bills, and give Maisy and Neela rides home--and Tom and Maisy both threw up in her car.\n\nI was getting hateful calls and texts all week telling me I had to pay to have Tom's wife's car cleaned and pay his MIL for watching the kids. Maisy and Neela have been calling me all kinds of names for abandoning them, but I snapped that they were all three sheets to the wind even after being told last month I wasn't driving them anymore. Tom eventually called to yell at me that if I didn't split the bill, and if I didn't DD, then what use was I? I asked if that was how he treated his wife, Maisy, or Neela, if they were only allowed to be around if they were \"useful\", because here I thought we were all just enjoying one another's company, since I certainly wasn't gaining anything useful from them spending hundreds of dollars funding their eating and drinking habits and then wasting my gas to drive their drunk arses home.\n\nI was blocked and none of them will speak to me now, and I just need to know if I'm the AH here.\n\nEdit: I used to drink heavily, too. I had to quit for an unrelated medical reason.", "created_utc": 1690551229, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15bxmnu/aita_for_refusing_to_dd_anymore_and_leaving_three/", "score": 3000, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And these people are not your friends.", "NTA\n\nYour friends want to behave like drunken college students on your monthly get-togethers. I'm not going to blame them for wanting this - that's the way they choose to enjoy a night out. But they have to own all the consequences, and not try to export the costs of their bacchanalia to you (or to anyone else).\n\nIt's normal enough for a friend who doesn't drink to drive the friends who do, but this kindness comes with obligations on the drinking friends to be courteous passengers, which means not getting in such a state that they are likely to throw up.\n\nAnd last weekend?  Your drunken friends think that somehow you need to pay for Tom's wife's car to be cleaned, because you wouldn't let them vomit in your car? Umm, no. The people who owe for the car cleaning are the people who vomited in it.\n\nThese people aren't your friends. It's not clear to me whether they ever liked you, but it's clear that they no longer do, and are just exploiting you.", "NTA\n\nYou're all in your thirties, and your friends are unable to regulate their drinking. Do they not know how to call a taxi? You set reasonable boundaries with them, and they kept trying to disregard them.\n\nAlso, you're their friend, not their mother. You shouldn't have to feel responsible for how they get home.\n\nThis may need to be a discussion with the group while you are all sober and explain why you have placed these boundaries. If they push back, it may be a good idea to put some distance between you all for a while.", "NTA. Why don\u2019t they just taxi/Lyft/Uber?", "NTA you warned them multiple times you weren\u2019t going to DD.  They are the ones who are AHs who can\u2019t limit their alcohol intake.  They thought you were bluffing about not being DD.  FAFO on their end.\n\nOn side not I\u2019d probably stop hanging out with these people they sound like selfish drunken AHs.", "NTA these people are not your friends", ">Tom eventually called to yell at me that if I didn't split the bill, and if I didn't DD, then what use was I?\n\nYea, these people are not your friends. Sounds to me like you guys had a relationship based around drinking heavily. Now that you don't drink and won't be their DD (and won't pay for their meals), they have no use for you. \n\nThey sound like shitty people anyways. Who gets so obliterated drunk at a *restaurant* that they're too incoherent to pay the bill and then puke in the car? Move on from these people.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nconfused about one thing.... You call them friends... WHY?   They are in their 30's and get so drunk that every time there is a serious chance that vomiting in the car is not a joke but a REAL poss/prob ability.  The thought that they were trying to force you to split the bill to cover their food is bad, but the alcohol part is outrageous.  The fact that you had to do it and they fought you on this is crazy (again you call them \"friends\"?)  The last time the conditions were clear, and they either did not care or they are alcoholics and are in need of treatment.  \n\nThe ramifications of that night should teach them a lesson, but as expected the \"friends\" are leaving out a lot of history so they can save face with their family.  You need friends, these are not even replicants of friends.", "NTA. Your friends are toxic people and you clearly don't need to put up with their BS.", "NTA. Their behaviour is pretty repulsive. You're not their mummy. You don't need to make sure they don't drink too much and that they get home safe. They've shown their true colours. I hope you find some better friends because you deserve so much better than this.", "NTA and also if people in their 30s are still regularly drinking so much at a restaurant that they can't pay the bill and throw up then holy shit, they need to grow the fuck up.", "NTA - These were individuals who viewed the friendship as transactional. They only wanted you there whilst you were providing \"worth\" - covering their expenses or, once the food/drink was resolved, their travel expenses.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat would happen if you were *all* drinking and getting in a state? Would that still be fine? It'd soon be \"You cover taxi/uber this time and I'll get the next meet ups!\" or \"Get a round in!\" but you end up buying more drinks than others etc. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOnce a friendship becomes transactional it has, as sad as it is, run its course. The fact they don't \"get\" that you're not obligated to ferry them around and did it because you were a friend with no expectations beyond simple looking after your stuff and not spewing, says a lot. They were inconvenienced and so they ended up needing to make alternate arrangements that cost them time and money and no doubt some ear bending off partners/MIL etc. Hence why it's gone back to transactional again straight away - YOU need to pay for the car to be cleaned. YOU need to pay for child care. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow, if you'd been asking them to contribute to fuel costs to take them home, you're still not obligated to actually take them if you don't feel like it, but it'd be a transaction and you'd all be doing the same thing ... but that's not the case. I'd count your blessings that they've exposed themselves for the self-centred individuals they are. I'm willing to bet these little get togethers now stop, sooner or later, as there's no-one to facilitate their little night out being cost effective and easy.", "NTA these friends act like teenagers. Who gets so drunk they throw up or can't pay their bills at 30 that's ridiculous. Tell them to grow up", "NTA, your \"friends\" are trashy cheap fucks.", "NTA. Let me see if I have this right.....You guys are in your mid-30s, some are married with kids. And your friends habitually get shit-faced, stick you with a disproportionate part of the bill, make you the DD, and the when you refuse they question your \"use\" to them. What in the blue chicken-fried fuck do you see in these worthless, using losers? They add NOTHING to your life. You need to dump these assholes completely and get better friends.", "Yeah... NTA. Yous seem to have friends who don't take personnal accountability to heart. They might sober up and apologize but don't reach out", "NTA\n\nThose people don't view you as a friend, they haven't for a while. You're not the asshole in this situation but you need to realize when to drop/leave something alone. You knew months ago what type of people they were when they wouldn't split the bill properly, that's when you should have stood your ground. You should have said you had your card and refused to pay extra, they assumed you were a pushover because you never stood up for yourself here.\n\nDon't try to contact any of them, they're not worth it. Hang out with other friends or try making new friends at work/social events in your area. Losing friends hurts but you lost these friends long before it got to this point.", "NTA. They\u2019re not your friends. You were just \u201cuseful\u201d to them. Find new friends. So sorry you had to deal with their shit. But it sounds like they did the work of going no contact for you.", "Nta. You have grown up after college.  They have not. Time to drop these so called friends. They have stated they only want you around to help pay for their drunken night out and then drive them home. This is not a friendship.  Their abuse of you after you warned them you would not be used again just proves they are not friends and do not value you as a friend. Why is it your fault or responsibilty to pay since their behavior caused the wife to leave her kids with her mom and drive to pick them Stay away from these childish self center aholes.", "Nta.  Not your friends.", "NTA. You set clear and strict boundaries and they got upset when you stood your ground and didn\u2019t let them cross them. You deserve better people in your life.", "NTA and these people are NOT your friends. Mid 30s and drinking until they puke is alcoholism. Block them and find new friends", "NTA and if they were honestly your friends they would pick up your bill since you are the DD, whenever my friend group went out the DD always had their food paid for. Still a lot cheaper than an uber.", "Obviously not the asshole.\n\nYour \"friends\" have serious issues. Be happy they blocked you.", "NTA. This is pretty odd, that people in their 30s who have children get so drunk they throw up on the car ride home. I don't blame you for cutting ties.", "Nta\n\nSplitting a check never benefits everyone in the group. And there's no reason for to to spilt a bill for something you weren't even there for. \n\nYou told them a month before that you weren't the dd, so they should have planned accordingly to have a ride set up ahead of time.\n\nIt sounds like this friendship ran it's course a long time ago, you matured, they didn't.", "NTA. You set healthy boundaries and found out your friends aren't friends. I'm sorry. It's hard when you start the become healthy and those around you do not. They often react with anger. It's not a reflection of your but them.", "NTA\n\nThese are not friends, they\u2019re users. I don\u2019t drink either, just not my thing. I don\u2019t judge those who do since I smoke weed, drinking just isn\u2019t for me, so I usually DD if we all go out together. Because my friends are actually my friends, they never assume I\u2019m DDing just because I\u2019m coming out with them, they always confirm it with me, and also if I\u2019m driving they don\u2019t get black out (exceptions are like weddings or stuff like that, but I don\u2019t mind in those cases)", "NTA \u2026 they are not your friends", "NTA in the least.   They're very selfish and immature people.  Get new friends.", "NTA. They revealed who they are. They are not your friends they just wanted to use you.", "These are not your friends. Consider being blocked a blessing and find better friends. NTA", "NTA! Why would you have to pay to get her car cleaned or anything that you didn\u2019t drink or eat.

This is relationship problem not aita", "NTA it sounds like you grew up and they still haven't.  It happens.  Mourn what was if you need to and be rid of them.", "NTA\n\nI saw in one of your comments and edit that you also used to drink but had to quit. It was probably much more reasonable to split the bill four ways when you were still drinking, but now you're not, and you shouldn't have to pay for all of that extra food and drink if your health keeps you from being able to enjoy it. And your health shouldn't be a reason to end a friendship just because you can't drink and they can; you've tried to maintain your friendship despite that.\n\nYou also agreed to DD, which honestly is pretty standard when you're the friend who doesn't drink, but you set a rule that is also pretty standard of keeping your car clean. When they didn't, you let them know in advance that you would not be driving them, and you reminded them ahead of time before they began to drink. You are not responsible for the actions of fully informed adults.\n\nPerhaps you all were once friends when you all could go out and get smashed, but I honestly think that this friendship is over and you might need to find friends who have better control of their social drinking.", "Of course not. Sad you even have to ask", "NTA \n\n\nBut why? Do you actually enjoy hanging out sober with three completely wasted people? As someone who doesn't drink, that sounds like a miserable weekend. I enjoy going to dinner/other social things with friends, but only when I can actually have conversations and enjoy their company.", "Just adding an NTA and a) you don't owe to pay for the wife's car to be cleaned, they do and b) these people are not good friends, go find better ones cause you seem like a sensible awesome person \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA  Please find new friends these people don't care about you.  Put a period and move on.", "NTA.\n\n> I was blocked and none of them will speak to me now\n\nLooks like the problem has resolved itself.\n\nGo look up the Bill of Assertive Rights.  Read it, then ask yourself again if you did anything offside by declaring, repeatedly, that you wouldn't be DD, then following through with that.\n\nThen go read 'When I Say No, I Feel Guilty.'  It will teach you, among other things, how to decide for yourself if you're an asshole for not doing something, rather than believing people who have flat out told you that your only use to them is as an unpaid servant.", "Those don't sound like friends. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, they only want your company as long as you're useful. Not because you're nice, not because they like you, but because they can use you. You did well to stand up for yourself and you're right: you got nothing out of the friendship.", "NTA. But I think your friendship with them has run it\u2019s course. Friends do not treat each other like they treat you.", "NTA. They are not your friends. With friends like that, you don't need enemies.", "NTA. So your friends used you to pay for their food and drink. When you put a stop to that, they used you for their free taxi service. When they could no longer find a way to use you, they blocked you. They're not your friends. You've outgrown them.", "NTA and if they\u2019re all that messed up, especially at that age, they need to reflect on their relationship with alcohol.  It\u2019s also a bit concerning that their safety and sobriety rests on your shoulders and you\u2019re expected to shoulder the burden of their bad choices.  I am super amused that THEY blocked YOU.  How drunk were they that they couldn\u2019t even pay the bill?  Why did they keep getting served even?  \n\nFind friends who want to do more than use you as an Uber.", "Holy christ. These people are mid-30s and still drinking until throw-up black-out drunk on a regular basis?!?! Holy fucking shit. Not to mention the fact that they seem to treat you poorly and yet you consider them friends.\n\n\nNTA. be kinder to yourself and get some mature friends who actually seem to like you.

They should have either planned on his wife getting them already or taken an Uber (although they may have refused them given their condition).  \n\nSo her drunk husband throws up in her car and somehow it\u2019s your fault?

We're all mid-30s now. We usually get together once a month to have dinner despite work and family obligations (virtually during the global event). Six months ago, I had to stand up to everyone about splitting the bill evenly because everyone else orders and eats appetizers and desserts, and everyone else drink copious amounts of alcohol every time we get together. I typically eat a main and drink water. I started checking menus in advance and only bringing enough cash to cover my bill plus tip and would \"forget\" my card at home and eventually sternly told them that I was no longer willing to pay an additional $50-$100 every time we went out to cover their appetizers, desserts, and drinking habits.\r  \n\r  \nWell, they all decided because I wasn't drinking anything but water, I should be the DD, which I initially agreed to because I was just happy that they eventually stopped arguing with me about splitting the bill. But at the time I told them sternly if any of them ever threw up in my car, that would be the end of it. \r  \n\r  \nLast month, Tom nearly threw up in my car. The only reason he didn't is because I pulled over and pulled him out of the car and onto the pavement instead. I sent a group text the next morning stating that I was no longer going to DD, and everyone complained that Tom only ALMOST threw up in my car. I again refused and told them that next month, they either had to limit their drinking so they could drive, or they had to find their own ride.\r  \n\r  \nLast weekend, I reminded everyone I wasn't driving anyone home. No one limited their intake at ALL, and by the end of the night, they were too drunk to even handle paying their bill. I went up and asked for my bill separately, paid, and walked out without saying goodbye. Tom's wife had to have her mother watch their two kids while she had to come down, cover their bills, and give Maisy and Neela rides home--and Tom and Maisy both threw up in her car.\r  \n\r  \nI was getting hateful calls and texts all week telling me I had to pay to have Tom's wife's car cleaned and pay his MIL for watching the kids. Maisy and Neela have been calling me all kinds of names for abandoning them, but I snapped that they were all three sheets to the wind even after being told last month I wasn't driving them anymore. Tom eventually called to yell at me that if I didn't split the bill, and if I didn't DD, then what use was I? I asked if that was how he treated his wife, Maisy, or Neela, if they were only allowed to be around if they were \"useful\", because here I thought we were all just enjoying one another's company, since I certainly wasn't gaining anything useful from them spending hundreds of dollars funding their eating and drinking habits and then wasting my gas to drive their drunk arses home.\r  \n\r  \nI was blocked and none of them will speak to me now, and I just need to know if I'm the AH here.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
