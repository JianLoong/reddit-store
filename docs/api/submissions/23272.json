Taylor's boyfriend, Tristan, who lives about an hour away from her, comes over for dinner once a week. Throughout these dinner nights, I have never witnessed Taylor and Tristan cooking a fresh homemade meal, as they usually opt for fast food or prepare frozen meals for dinner, and while I hold no judgment towards them for this choice, this detail becomes significant later in the story.\n\n\r  \nAbout four nights ago, I returned home from work to find Tristan in our kitchen. As I began preparing my own dinner, I struck up a conversation with him. Being from a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern culture, I take pride in my cooking skills, having learned everything from the women in my family. Tristan couldn't help but comment on how incredible the meal smelled. Normally, I don't share my food as I budget my grocery expenses for one person. However, seeing that he appeared genuinely hungry, I decided to offer him some of my food. By the time Taylor joined us in the kitchen, he was already on his second plate. After Tristan explained the situation to her, Taylor gave me a side-eye but remained silent, proceeding to cook some frozen chicken nuggets for herself. As they engaged in conversation, I continued cleaning up my dishes, minding my own business.\n\n\r  \nLater, Tristan asked if he could have the recipe so that he could share it with his mom and she could try cooking the same dish. I suggested that I would message Taylor later about it. At this point, Taylor made a sarcastic comment about the meal being so good that even a picky eater like Tristan enjoyed it. Trying to maintain a lighthearted atmosphere, I attributed the deliciousness to my mama's cooking. In a semi-joking manner, Tristan then suggested that I cook for all three of them sometime, offering to pay for the meal and even bring free wine. We all shared a laugh, but Taylor seemed visibly disturbed by the idea and expressed that she wasn\u2019t interested in my cultural dishes (despite never having tasted them). Brushing off her slightly racist comment, I responded that once someone gets past the initial smell, the dishes taste heavenly. Tristan agreed.\n\n\r  \nUnexpectedly, Taylor became very upset and started scolding her boyfriend for enjoying my \"smelly food,\" suggesting that from then on, we two should have dinner together. She stormed off to her room, and Tristan followed her after apologizing to me. Since that incident, Taylor has started doing things she previously agreed not to do, such as tying up garbage bags and leaving them in the kitchen instead of properly disposing of them. Before I confront Taylor about her recent actions, I want to know if I am in the wrong in this situation.

She also sounds jealous. And berating someone who likes \"smelly\" food? She needs to grow up.", "NTA. It seems to me you both did something to head off Taylor's jealousy, which I think would be perfectly understandable, and Tristan went further. Taylor needs to watch her temper.", "NTA - but you are in the middle of an issue between them.  This isn't your fault.  This is Taylor being jealous without real cause.  Taylor is probably going to be hurt no matter what you say, but do apologize for the misunderstanding, not what you did, and then confront her on her recent actions.", "INFO:  Knowing that Tristan was there for dinner with Taylor, did you make enough for/offer Taylor any of the food you and her boyfriend were eating?  Or did you leave her to fend for herself?\n\nYWBTA if you did not offer Taylor any food after offering her boyfriend 2 plates of food knowing that he was there for dinner with her, not you.  Yes, he could have said no to your offer but when you made the offer to him, did you think about Taylor as well?", "NTA. You were being kind and polite. What'd you make and would you share the recipe with us?", "NTA>  Me being petty would take her man just cuzz", "NTA she is super jelous", "Idk I'm torn on this. He was there as HER guest, to have dinner WITH her. You could've offered him just a small portion. Instead you offered him a substantial amount (2 plates!) which effectively meant that he had already had his dinner and now Taylor was left to have dinner by herself. \nHe also obviously is at fault because he's the one who chose to eat 2 plates and not care that he had dinner plans already with his gf. I think I'll say ESH. Taylor is also an AH because while it's understandable she felt upset, she didn't have to be racist in the process.", "This is a tough one. Firstly, Taylor was obviously in the wrong for the stuff she said. Obviously!\n\nStill\u2026 if I was held up at work and hurried home to have dinner with my boyfriend, only to find he had already eaten with my roommate, I\u2019d be hurt too. I don\u2019t think she was insecure of him liking your food, I think she was feeling a bit robbed of a nice evening with her boyfriend that maybe she looked forward to a lot.\n\nGentle ESH, I think.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

For the stew you need chopped lamb meat (You can use cow or chicken too but traditionally its lamb), and cooking oil, I usually use one yellow onion, two red peppers, and one tomato, (But I do occasionally change the quantity based on the size of the ingredients)  tomato paste and seasonings. (Salt, pepper, and cumin). For the sauce, you need eggplants, milk, butter, flour, and cheese.\r  \n\r  \nFirst, the eggplants are roasted in the oven or on the stove until charred. Once roasted, peel off the skin and chop the eggplants.\r  \nIn a pan, heat oil and add flour. Stir them together.\r  \nAdd the chopped eggplants to the pan and mash them well.\r  \nLower the heat and slowly add milk to the eggplant mixture while stirring constantly.\r  \nMix everything thoroughly.\r  \nNext, add shredded cheese and turn off the heat. Keep stirring until the cheese is fully incorporated, and the \"be\u011fendi\" is ready.\r  \nIn a separate pan, add some oil and heat it up.\r  \nOnce the pan is hot, add the meat and cook until it releases and absorbs its juices.\r  \nAdd finely chopped onions and peppers to the meat and continue cooking until they are softened.\r  \nWhen they are cooked, add tomato paste and mix it in.\r  \nAfter the tomato paste, add deseeded and chopped tomatoes to the pan.\r  \nAdd around 1.5-2 cups of water, cover the pan, and cook until the meat is fully cooked.\r  \nAfter it's cooked, season it with salt, black pepper, and cumin. (If you have tough meat, you can use a pressure cooker to cook it first. You can achieve the same taste by adding the meat broth instead of water while cooking.)\r  \nTo serve, place the \"be\u011fendi\" on the serving dish and place the meat on top. Enjoy!", "NTA.
