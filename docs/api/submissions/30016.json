It\u2019s too bad that she hasn\u2019t warmed up to you, but maybe there is a good reason if you felt comfortable making a decision like this. Also, if you don\u2019t think growing up with a vacation home means a child is privileged, I\u2019m not sure what you think that word means.", "YTA.\n\n\u201cWe have a vacation home when we are by no means rich.\u201d Hahahahahahahahaha. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m having a shitty night and needed a good laugh and man, thanks for that. Imagine having a vacation home in \u201cthe Cape\u201d and thinking you\u2019re anything besides privileged. Hilarious.\n\nBut yeah, you can\u2019t invite your son and tell him to leave his wife at home just because you don\u2019t like her. Especially when it sounds like you\u2019re only problem with her is that she\u2019s not trying to be close close family with you. I can\u2019t imagine why. Also can\u2019t imagine this is going to help.\n\nStill giggling about the privilege comment.", "YTA\n\nFamily vacation means the whole family, not just who you like best. She married your son; she is now your family.\n\nAlso, \n> I'm wary of someone who seemingly doesn't value familial relationships\n\nWOW would that statement be a red flag even if we *weren\u2019t* talking about a situation where you\u2019re disvaluing family relationships. Hi pot, stop bullying the kettle.", "YTA - She is married to your son, inviting him on a family trip and not her is blatantly saying that you don't consider her as family. I get it that you guys aren't close but it's straight up rude to invite only half of a married couple to something like this. \n\nIt's made worse by the fact that you specifically invited Matt, who from the post I'm guessing isn't actually married to your son. Inviting partners is fine, but inviting him and leaving out actual spouses is rubbing salt in the wound. \n\nThink about how you would feel if she and your son invited your other kid, their partners and your husband but not you to a family event because that's almost exactly what you've done to her.", "Wow!!! YTA. Your son is married and you want him to go on a trip with your whole family and ditch his wife. During the holidays. You want her to spend the holidays without her husband because you don\u2019t like her. And you don\u2019t see a problem with this. Baffled!!!", "YTA. It would've been okay to not invite John, but you threw a grenade into your relationship with Tess by making it clear you don't like having her around. She shows up to events and makes an effort, she's just boring and you don't enjoy her company. That's fine, but you can't separate her from John anymore now that they've chosen each other as life partners.", "Let me get this right. You don't like your DIL, so you're trying to exclude her from the family vacation. Or, as any sane person would interpret it: you're trying to exclude her from the family.\n\nYTA for trying to break up you sons marriage.", "YTA totally. You asked your son to come alone? You literally asked him to pick you over his wife who is his family. HIS family. You can't relax? Oh please. Get over yourself. You just needlessly created a terrible division between you and your son and his wife and I don't know how it will be fixed because you told her you don't want her around. I bet you do that a lot despite you claiming to be all welcoming. You clearly judge her. You're \"wary\" of someone who doesn't act like you do. She may be shy. She may be reserved. She just may be different and still wonderful, but you don't like her and you've made that clear. So congratulations on screwing up your relationship with your son. But you've got your other son and his partner and you clearly like them better, so I guess you're good to go.", "YTA. You sound like one of those awful \u201cboy moms\u201d who can\u2019t stand having another woman around. You complain that Tess isn\u2019t close to you and then you pull this mean girl BS. And miss me with that we have a holiday home but we aren\u2019t rich disingenuous nonsense!", "YTA. \n\nIt sounds like you just expected Tess to fit into your family and haven't bothered getting to know her. Her likes, dislikes, activities etc. And yes, your kids were privileged having a vacation home. That simply is a privilege. \n\nOf course it is wrong to have a family vacation absent a family member. Now you have solidified your middle child not attending and likely not attending many \"family\" events in the future. You planned to leave his family at home.", "YTA. \n\nHave you considered the fact that maybe she saw the relationship with your sons partner and felt left out or even intimated? Have YOU put in effort to get to know her one on one? When someone new is coming into the family, I think it\u2019s important for the other family members to make that person feel welcomed and included. It can help them feel more comfortable and open up more if you take the time to do one on one things with them. \n\nFor someone who claims family relationships are so important, I think you need to reevaluate what that actually means.", "First of all, lol at \"we have vacation home but we're not rich\". I'd like to know what parallel universe you live in, untethered to reality.\n\nNow to the point, YTA. If she's married to your son, she's family. She's not required to show up exactly as you wish her to be, for her to be treated as such. Not everyone is a talkative person, that has no bearing on whether they value family time or not. If you're inviting one of your children's partners, the invite needs to go out to all children's partners. By not inviting her you're not only disrespecting her membership in the family, you're also making your son choose between his mother and wife.", "YTA It's totally disrespectful to invite everyone and their spouses except for one. Also, if you open a vacation home, you may not be rich rich but you are privileged.", "I\u2019d love to hear her side of the story. I have a feeling you\u2019re not as nice to another woman in the family taking your boy away as you might think. Maybe she gets the feeling she\u2019s not good enough for your boy", "of course YTA how can you not see that you aren't, how would you feel if your MIL invited everyone including your husband on vacation and didn't invite you, way to go, now she really won't like you and you probably lost your son as well. also having a vacation home is a privilege most people can't even afford one home.", "YTA. This is your son's *wife*. She's not going anywhere. She's your family now, like it or not. Alienating her isn't going to make the situation any better. It sounds like she's never done anything wrong, she just isn't particularly open or warm. Obviously she isn't going to be as inviting as your son-in-law who has known your family for a decade. I'm sure that's an intimidating dynamic to enter into, especially if she is shy. And now you've given her a valid reason to be even more closed off.", "YTA-Yeah your weird.. So glad that my mother in law always invites me everywhere and treats me like her own daughter.", "YTA, and I think you\u2019ve torpedoed any chance of having a close relationship with your DIL.\n\nYou\u2019re the reason you and your DIL aren\u2019t close, btw.  You are absolutely playing favorites.", "YTA for excluding Tess because she does not fit your standards of family. You are driving a wedge between your son and his wife. Should your son accept your plan, this would profoundly hurt his spouse and provoke cracks in their marriage.\n\nListen to your husband and accept people for who they are and not who you think they should be. Apologize to both John and Tess and re-extend the invitation, this time to both of them. And if they do not accept it, be gracious about that, allow them to get over this and wish that they find it in their heart to forgive you.", "My goodness, woman!  Yta.  And the \u201c family\u201d that agrees with you, too.", "You're so wonderfully and incredibly family minded, so accepting regardless of sexuality!\n\nUnless it's another woman. In which case you become jealous and judgemental. \n\nYou love being the only woman in a household of men, you love the attention and extra care I do not doubt they give you because \"you're the little woman\". You see your DIL as competition. She's not. She is also your family. \n\nAnd why do I get the feeling that you're 'trying to get to know her' is you butting in and being incredibly nosy in her life and business, telling her what to do, think and how to behave.\n\nOh, also, having a spare house you only use for vacations when the cost of living rises daily and most people can barely afford the essentials _is_ privileged. You're family shouldn't be shamed for having that privilege, but you could damn well recongise and acknowledge it. YTA.", "YTA\n\nyou are playing favourites.\n\nAsking your Son if he would to come alone is very disrespectful to her.\n\nYou may not have the best relationship with her, but I guarantee you have caused issues in his marriage. Well done for that!!!!!\n\nYour Husband was right you should have just let it be", "YTA. Have you ever tried beyond a bit of conversation. \n\nHaving married into a \"close knit family\" I bet there are plenty of in jokes or conversations she's not part of.  Or family meals where everyone has the set thing to do or bring  but she's not part of it and no one tries to make her part of it. That by the way really hurts.\n \nYou are happy being the wonderful friendly loving matriarch.   Have you ever thought it may not be easy  for her.  Not everyone has the wonderful social skills you seem to pride yourself on. And now you've just totally confirmed that she is not family, not worthy and you can't be bothered.", "YTA  \n\n\nWhile you may be \"correct\" in your assessment of the DIL, she IS STILL FAMILY! The proper way to do that, if at all, would be to talk to HER! \"I notice that we are not close, we are planning a family trip. You can opt out or participate. We won't force you to attend or disclude you.\"  \n\n\nBut you went around her. It WAS disrespectful. You owe her an apology.", "YTA. this was a huge mistake on your part. Your son should have been the one to bring up that if his wife wasn't invited, he would not be coming. So that mistake is on him.", "YTA. Have you even tried to have an open conversation before metaphorically cutting your nose to spite your face?\n\nAlso, I find it a huge red flag when a parent says everyone is so close and the family is tight knit.

My youngest child, Christopher, has been with his partner since they were 17. They are now both 24. While they started their relationship as seniors in high school, they had been friends for years prior and Matt has been something of a permanent fixture in our home since he was 14. He came out to Chris's dad and I as bisexual before he told his own parents. I like to joke that while I birthed three kids, I have a lot more than that thanks to me volunteering at my sons' schools and our home often being considered the main hangout spot when my boys were all in school and playing sports.\r  \n\r  \nFamily has always been number one on my priority list and I happened to hit the son in law jackpot. We're also incredibly close with his parents and they say the same about Christopher feeling like one of their own children. We often do joint holiday and birthday celebrations these days.\r  \n\r  \nMy middle child, who we'll call John (26M), got married to Tess (27F) around a year and a half ago. I had hoped the wedding would spark a shift in mine and Tess's relationship because up to that point she hadn't seemed interested in getting to know any of us. Despite my wishes and best attempts, nothing changed. She joins us for holidays and occasional dinners with John like she always has, but our conversations with her are always dry at best. This all felt like such a 180 flip from the close knit family dynamic I was used to and I'm wary of someone who seemingly doesn't value familial relationships, chosen or otherwise, much at all. Still, I've been trying to be patient.\r  \n\r  \nThe brings us to our conflict: When planning our winter trip down the Cape this year, I made the decision to call John and ask him if he wanted to come alone. The trip is usually a long weekend style thing (we leave on Thursday night and stay until Monday night) and drive from our house to the vacation home only takes an hour and some change. I'm not giving up on my relationship with Tess, but it is harder to relax when she's around. She's also made some strange remarks in the past about my kids being \"privileged\" because we have a vacation home when we are by no means rich. My son said he would think about it and get back to me, but that he would probably join us for either a day trip or only one night of the trip.\r  \n\r  \nI then received a strongly worded text from Tess saying what I proposed was beyond disrespectful and that she couldn't believe I had even asked. She also said I was 'playing favorites.'\r  \n\r  \nMy family was in agreement with me (Tess never really speaks to them much either) but my husband thinks I should've just let things be. AITA?\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But it also makes sense since you guys aren\u2019t close. It\u2019s interesting that people think you just like to be around \u201call your sons\u201d when you really come off as someone who is used to being loved by everyone and is taken by surprise that Tess has not taken to you like most.", "YTA, if your family outside your husband think this is okay they are being TA as well. \n\nI typed a whole long paragraph about the why, then erased it bc really bc there is nothing more to say then it is not okay to exclude only one member of a family, especially when that person only crime is not being as outgoing as your SIL. \n\nIn one not involved in the core mean girl\u2019s inner circle of your family hearing this story is going to tell you how very much TA you are.", "YTA.\n\nShe is family - she's married to your son!\n\nYou clearly favour having sons - all 4 of them - and don't want any daughters.\n\nA vacation house is most definitely privileged! \n\nStart being nicer to your dil for the sake of your son if you love him so much.\n\nJesus christ, you're the asshole.", "Lol, YTA \n\n*Family has always been number one on my priority list* \n\nyet\n\n*When planning our winter trip down the Cape this year, I made the decision to call John and ask him if he wanted to come alone.*\n\nFamily isn't your priority, just certain members of your extended family. \n\nPlenty of MILs can claim rightly that family is their priority while acknowledging that they don't quite click with some family members. But if you are going to do a family vacation, you don't just invite some and not others. You don't invite your son without his wife. You must have realized that this put him in a horrible situation, where he had to choose between wife and family. \n\nYou can set ground rules for conversations and manners, but once you start excluding people, you are violating your own family values. If your \"family all\" agrees with you, sounds like you've all made Tess feel excluded in the past, and you already don't consider her husband to be part of \"my family\" any more.", "YTA. Excluding Tess also means excluding her husband. What was the purpose of explaining that you have a son who is married to a man? It had nothing to do with your AITA question but oddly reminds me of the I love my dead gay son scene in Heathers.", "You claim to have \"family values\" but then encourage your son to ditch his chosen family?

When you marry you choose a spouse, his family are part of the package deal but it doesn't mean that you can dictate what that relationship is.  Her remarks were not tactful maybe but not strange, and show that she is uncomfortable with some of the things you take as normal.  Well you have certainly found a way to make her uncomfortable with you for the rest of your life.  If I was your daughter in law I wouldn't be giving you the time of day from now on.

Should your son accept your plan, this would profoundly hurt his spouse and provoke cracks in their marriage.\n\nI have to wonder if this might be a desired outcome for OP. That she might want to cause strife between John and Tess so that their marriage will crumble and then she can aim him at someone she approves of.\n\nFortunately, it appears that John is not going to get suckered into her spiteful little game. That they wedge that is more likely to get driven here is between OP and her son.\n\nWith any luck OP is not just learning that you have to accept people as they are. Hopefully she's learning that family dynamics change over time. That marriages and children in the extended family change the dynamics. And often in ways that are outside of your control. If not, she's probably going to wake up one day and realize that the \"close family dynamic\" that she prizes hasn't just changed, it's disappeared.", "This is well written and much nicer than what I'm going to say.  OP, what you did was petty and unkind.  You definitely owe your DIL and your son an apology, and if you are really worried about what makes someone a good family member, you should take a good look in the mirror.", "If they want a nice relaxing vacation with no drama, then perhaps it is time for them to migrate away from family vacations to vacations of just them and their partner, and leave *all* the kids out completely.", "The extra son is really telling because he has absolutely nothing to do with the story. Those entire first two paragraphs are useless to the story at hand besides to talk about how much she likes her other son\u2019s partner.", "She has so many children because she volunteered at school! \ud83d\ude44", "Well said!", "I wonder if it also has something to do with image having a vacation home on the Cape is expensive and sounds like Tess is from a lower income bracket and OP doesn't try to make her feel welcome.", "The extra son is here as a preamble of how accepting she is.Only for the OP to go nuclear against a woman that is not interested to become an extra daughter", "She\u2019s the cool mom with the hang out house! \ud83d\ude44"]}
