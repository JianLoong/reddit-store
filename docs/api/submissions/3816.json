The roommate clearly abuses the non-confrontational relationship that you have with one another to indulge herself in your purchases like a kid in a candy store.", "NTA. I had a friend whose roommate was stealing her things. I loaned her my webcam which records the last 24 hours of footage to a cloud, and I suggest you pick one up too, they can be very affordable and work in low light. Tell your roommate that it is not okay to go into your room without your permission or to go through your things, preferably after you\u2019ve put the webcam somewhere inconspicuous. Then if she keeps this up, when you catch her red handed in the future it will be abundantly clear that she was not allowed, and you won\u2019t have to go through her stuff to get it back. \n\nEdit: u/shhsjsjshssjshs Also I know you\u2019re non confrontational but you might consider talking to an RA about switching rooms. Sometimes someone leaves early in the school year and a room opens up.", "NTA.  Please immediately go to your RA & if that doesn't work, the person in charge of student residences.  Offer a complete list of what was stolen and hidden from you.  Explain that you don't feel safe living with a thief and insist on a room change.  Don't succumb to pressure to somehow work this out through meaningful dialogue -- there is no way to meaningfully dialogue her from being a thief.  In the meantime, invest in a cheap trunk with a big, fat lock.  If roommate asks, feel free to tell her that it's because she steals things.", "NTA. Did you report to RA? If you show receipts too it will be more evidence.", "NTA and I would go to your dorm leader etc and do a written paper trail that she\u2019s stolen hundreds of $ worth of your belongings too", "Nta", "NTA but report her ASAP before she gets ahead and reports you for going through her stuff", "NTA - What is she going to do - ask you back for the stuff she stole from you? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA. It's your stuff that was never communal", "NTA\n\nShe stole from you. You would've never gon through her stuff if your belongings weren't missing. Finish your search and request a new roommate. Barring that, get a footlocker and a lock.", "Unlike some who feel you should have handled this differently, I think you did the right thing. When there\u2019s stuff missing and you\u2019ve got ONE roommate, you don\u2019t owe this thief the courtesy of a polite chat about this. Take steps to get the rest of your stuff, then protect yourself and your belongings. NTA.", "NTA...she crossed the line in swiping your stuff. You were just getting it back. I think it's time to find a new roommate. Or buy a lock.", "NTA", "NTA\nBit be careful with the reporting. Check your rights re searching her bags.\nGood luck.", "NTA- but I'm curious how you differentiate between private and communal items? And what would you guess could be running through her mind?  Did she somehow think that you wouldn't notice?", "NTA get your stuff back", "Fuck that! Do it!  NTA!!", "Info: did you have a discussion about things that used to be communal no longer being communal?", "ESH\n\nShe stole. You were correct in your presumption... this time. But if she hadn't actually taken it, you had already gone through her personal belongings and that isn't okay. You should have talked to her and, if necessary, gone through the proper channels to report the suspected theft.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I forgot to add any info about this, but yes I had a discussion with her saying that I was packing some of my cooking stuff because of my trip with my boyfriend( i didnt tell her it was ALSO bc i was pissed at her for treating me like shit). She agreed and I said if she ever needed anything Id be willing to pull it out if she asked.", "What do you mean she was correct \"this time\" ? How could she not be correct ? Like the items just vanished out of existence ?", "I would get out of that situation immediately if I could =]", "What? I think it was completely fair to retrieve her *own things*. OP got her things back, didn\u2019t take anything that wasn\u2019t rightfully hers. If you violate someone\u2019s privacy, steal someone else\u2019s things, and put them in your own bags, I feel like you assume the risk of that person coming to look for them. Moving forward no one should be going through anyone else\u2019s things, and if the roommate does so after they\u2019ve spoken about it, OP would have proof of the invasion and theft with use of a webcam, so no need to go looking for them.", "Go through it all now, and contact your dorm RA. This shit isn\u2019t acceptable.  You can bet she\u2019ll try to toss anything you don\u2019t find so she isn\u2019t caught stealing those items as well.

But you certainly shouldn't have gone through any others unsupervised,  and PLEASE don't do any more. That will not end well for you,  and I bet you a dollar it ends in a counter-accusation of you taking her things.\n\nBut yeah, she stole your shit. Shame on her.", "Truthfully it almost doesn't matter. If someone thinks you stole from them there is no relationship left to salvage really, whether she did it or not.", "I understand your pov!

I mean she did take it", "Okay so we don\u2019t know all the details, but I\u2019m giving OP the benefit of the doubt here as the way she writes makes it sound like there was no other option than that the roommate was to blame. And speaking from personal experiences, in the anecdote I was referring to my friend had exhausted all other possibilities before realizing her roommate was stealing from her. Unless they have multiple roommates it\u2019s highly unlikely someone would be stealing hundreds of dollars of food, spices, and miscellany. I\u2019m sticking with my judgment on this one.", "She had a lot of food missing and the roommate was the only other person who had access to it, it\u2019s pretty safe to assume the roommate took it.", "I live in a college dorm where ONLY my roommate and I can get in. If it wasnt me then it was her or someone she let in, it ended up being her. Even if it was Someone she brought in she would still be at fault for allowing them to steal my stuff and her just watching.", "In a communal environment there is always another possibility.", "You still went about it the wrong way. If you were that sure, you had options including reporting it."]}
