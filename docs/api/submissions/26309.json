As long as he puts forth no effort, he does not get what it takes to do what you do.", "NTA - here\u2019s what I would do. Kindly agree to the celebration. Maybe even go out and buy the ingredients (on his card) and print off a recipe. \n\nThen on the morning of said party \u201creceive a call\u201d from work. Leave the house and turn your phone off. Go and sit in your car and read a book, see a movie, go for lunch, check in to a spa. \n\nDo whatever you want but just leave him to deal with it. \n\nThen waltz back in around 11pm, say a nice hello to everyone, make your excuses, add in a yawn then go for a shower and go straight to bed. \n\nLeave all mess for him to deal with as you have a busy work week ahead", "NTA. But girl, why? Tell him to have his party, but you\u2019re only doing appetizers and the rest is up to him. And that\u2019s that. He\u2019s a doctor and that info does not require intense deciphering. \u201cI will do apps and that is it. The rest is up to you. *All* of the rest.\u201d For added insurance, bet him 5 bucks and future \u201cno dinner party\u201d rights that he won\u2019t whine and plead and pout about you not doing more than apps. Write \u201cNo dinner parties\u201d on the five dollar bill. If he wins, pay him the 5 dollars graciously. If he loses, frame the bill and hang it in the house. Point to it when he whinges. Bonus points if he whinges and whines and you don\u2019t say a word, you just help him and *take a picture* of your unsmiling self washing dishes at 3am and pointing to a clock and then you frame that pic with the fiver you point to forever after. Caption the pic \u201cThe Last Dinner Party\u201d", "Your husband is married to a successful DOCTOR and doesn't understand that sexism is outdated?\n\nHeavens no, don't host the party.  He needs to do ALL the work for the next party before I would ever consider hosting with him again.\n\nAlso, I would have gotten him out of bed to do the dishes and clean-up after the last party.  \n\nI might consider hiring a caterer or a clean-up crew for parties if he still wants to host, and if you can afford it.", "Nta he wants to host, he needs to do all the work", "If he goes straight to bed he obviously has no idea how much work is left to do. You stay up cleaning until 4 - 5 ? Why do you keep doing that to yourself? He's oblivious. Have you asked him what he thinks you do after he's gone to bed? \n\nStop being a doormat. Get some sleep. Go out for breakfast - let him work it out. He'll get there.", "NTA I assume by the age of your children that you have been together for a long time. I am also assuming that you do a lot more heavy lifting around all the household chores if this is what he is like at a dinner party. It is time for a long talk about who does what in general not just the dinner party. This reads like a 1950\u2019s relationship, think about all the things you do and ask yourself if you are actually happy and want to keep doing this for another 40 ish years. I think you already know the answer. Good luck.", "Nta.", "NTA.  His party, have him hire staff to clean, cook, serve and clean again.  Attend if you are home, but make no commitment.  You both make enough money, so let him hire to throw his party.", "OMG NTA. Of course he loves entertaining, it's easy breezy for him. Tell some folks to come over, pour some drinks, chatty chat chat, eat some good food, chat some more, go to bed.  That level of involvement is only ok if you're a 2 year old.\n\nLet him know he has 3 options:\n\n1 buckle down and help with **everything**, from getting the house ready, to getting the meal together,  being a good host (which is more than pouring a drink), cleaning up afterwards\n\n2 Hire (and pay for) everything needed: cleaning service, caterer, etc. And that you will join him in pouring cocktails and relaxing with your guests \n\n3 Not have them over", "Make a new rule, if he invites people order, it\u2019s his job to make it work. You dont lift a single finger even if you see him struggling. Im sorry but what an ass", "Say you forgot you have work that day, and go to a hotel.", "Do you two make time to talk to eachother?  Sounds like this could easily be worked out with a conversation.", "NTA. Have you tried just not cleaning up the mess? Just not cooking or putting anything together?", "NTA\n\nUnfortunately, just as the party starts, you get called in for an emergency.  \n\nGotta run. Have fun.", "NTA, but have you actually expressed this to him? I assume you enjoy being married to each other, so I assume he isn't a completely misogynistic ass (usually people include that). \n\nJust say that you would enjoy hosting more (if that is true) if the burden wasn't all on you. He may think that tomorrow for dishes is fine. Do you feel the same way? \n\nIf you set a boundary of \"the dishes need to be done by you before lunch tomorrow or I will not be interested in another party at our home\". \n\nI don't want to put the mental labor on you - so maybe tell him to draw up a list of things that need to happen pre and post hosting that need to happen. Then, you can divide it out. \n\nIt is easier to poke holes: \n\nYou forgot cleaning the bathrooms. \n\nChanging the hand towels. \n\nGetting out the dishes. \n\nPlanning the menu. \n\nAppetizers need to be refilled\n\nEtc. \n\n\n\nWhich of those tasks is he going to own?", "My husband used to be like that.  He grew up with zero domestic skills, because his parents were sexist.  When we first got married, he thought having people over was great fun.  But he thought he was one of the guests!  \n\nSo, I started listing everything that had to be done having people over, and I handed him the list of his responsibilities.  We now entertain a lot less!", "This is just ridiculous. Tell him you're fine with having a party if he does all the work for it that you've always had to do. Period. And then stick to it.\n\nIt's not surprising that he enjoys parties he doesn't have to do anything for, although a decent partner wouldn't put you in this position.\n\nSo, NTA. You would be if you kept on doing this for him, though.", "NTA\n\nInform him to hire a party planner and servers or do everything himself since he is the one who wants to host a party. Then, he might understand clearly how much work goes into  it.", "Just hire caterers", "You are not the asshole, but you are the idiot for setting this precedent. \n\nAnd kinda the asshole for showing your sons how this is an okay way to treat women (as maids).", "Your husband is an AH for dumping all the work on you when he wants to do the entertaining.  STOP being a servant in your own home.  kt", "I would 100% agree to host the party. I would also be absent and refuse to help. Homeboy needs to learn a lesson.", "This is what I was going to say.
