Otherwise, he is responsible for his guests.", "i dont know how to answer without insulting your husband. i would stop doing anything for him. and probably die on that hill. NTA", "Why have you EVER allowed him to do this?  You need to do some serious self-reflection as to why you married a man who treats you like a servant.  Then if you want to stay in this marriage, you need to either come to terms with being a servant (I don't recommend this) or you need to rebalance your relationship with your husband and form a true partnership.  He isn't going to like this as he would prefer that you do all the work, he gets all the glory and a good nights rest.  So, you might want to get a counselor/therapist involved in helping you rebalance the partnership and also keep the balance in check (I sense he is the type that may agree to it and then either weaponize incompetence or fade back to normal).", "NTA my husband would do something similar, great host but none of the work, I put a stop to it.", "NTA\n\nBut WHY are you doing all the work? Just don't do it. Say to husband, \"It's fine with me as long as you do all the preparation and clean up.\"", "Tell him to contribute more or else don't keep the party.

You are both probably making 6figures and can easiy shell out a few 100$ to make this a stress free event?\n\nMy uncle always hires catering and a cleaner and has a party every few months or sometimes once a month. It costs him a few 1000 a year which is peanuts when you are probably gonna be milionaires or are already milionaires.

May be time for you to reverse the roles.. you have a lovely party serving the cocktails and let him cover all your usual duties..  in a way you've put yourself in this position by doing all the work in the 1st place but it's never too late to change things up..", "NTA..\n\nBut suggest - if he insists - you handle cocktails while he handles appetisers, main course, dessert and after party cleaning of all expensive crockery and your home?", "NTA. Why does he think it's acceptable to \"host\" a party but do literally none of the work of hosting?", "NTA - Nope! Until he does the cooking and cleaning for the parties HE wants to have, the answer is no. He is putting absolute undue pressure on you so that he can have the praise and entertainment. While you are forced to clean, cook, entertain, clean up afterwards... because he refuses to. For his own party \\*\\*major side eye\\*\\*\n\nUntil it's either equal or FAIR (currently it is neither) it's off the table. If he is feeling some kind of way, he can buy steak, chicken, hot dogs, hamburgers (whatever) and grill. He can make a couple side dishes (or buy them) and open a bag of chips. Voila! Instant 'dinner party that even HE can manage!

What else is he being an ass about?  Are the two of you parenting your children jointly? What about the household chores?\n\nI think you've been doing everything for so long that he's come to expect this of you. It's definitely time for you to speak up and create some expectations here.", "That includes the cooking but make sure he knows in advance this party is on him and the only thing you will do is serve cocktails just like he does.

That why should you host parties your only ever the cook and maid at. So he either stops inviting people or is fully responsible for organising and doing it all on his own without giving you added work.", "Yes! Make sure you're not at home to let him know you're serious", "Not help. He doesn\u2019t have to \u201chelp\u201d he had to DO", "He could employ caterers to sort the clean-up too?", "Or take the shift right after the party so she isn\u2019t there for cleaning up time"]}
