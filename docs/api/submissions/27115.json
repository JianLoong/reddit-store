They can tell which home is using the service and many (Netflix included) will charge you extra. Some even allow a logged in user to charge extra for special movies and events. You could end up with a MUCH bigger bill than you expected at the end of the month.\n\nI just saw a huge red flag with what your boyfriend said. He actually expects you to have to \"ask\" to use the service you are paying for? It's time to dump him and change the passwords. Please, please don't stay with someone like that!", "NTA.  When I couldn\u2019t get in my account because people were watching, I just changed the passwords and moved on.  And didn\u2019t give my account out any more.", "NTA. Change your password on your subscriptions and log eeryone off without notice. I had this happen when sharing with my daughter who lives in another state. It was fine until I began to get alerts about people signing in to my account from other states on different devices. Someone also added a channel to my Hulu sub, doubling the monthly amount at my expense. I immediately logged everyone off and changed the password. She had to contact me to use it again, and we had a talk. She can still use it as long as it is on only one of her devices at a time, and no add-ons.", "NTA. \n\u201cI should just ask her to let me watch something\u201d \nWhy should you have to ask permission to watch something on YOUR ACCOUNT", "No, in no way, EVER, are you the asshole. You were indeed being taken advantage of (at least, i\u2019m pretty sure...) and you had every right to say no. You are a grown adult who pays for your own stuff, you\u2019re allowed to not share when you don\u2019t want to! And the worst part about this is that you had to ask the person you shared WITH to share with YOU. There\u2019s so much wrong with that. But not with you, no you\u2019re safe don\u2019t worry. \nYou are not the asshole.", ">I was too shy to call my boyfriend's mother\n\n>but in this case she didn't ask me directly but had her daughter ask my boyfriend, who then asked me, lol. As if there was some embarrassment involved on her part.\n\nYour boyfriend needs to examine that he's dating his mom.", "Change your passwords, kick everyone off and stop sharing passwords with people who aren\u2019t paying the bill. \n\nIf your bf is unhappy with that answer he can open an account and share his password with whomever as he\u2019s paying for it. \n\nOP it is easier to be a people pleaser but then you don\u2019t get to complain for being walked all over like a rug.  \n\nPlease work on shining up and using your spine to say no. It will be a bit uncomfortable at first but gets easier each time.  Also tends to weed out people from your life who are only interested in what they can get from you.", "NTA - but, i dunno.  It's such a little thing.  I kind of grudgingly let my mom use my netflix and hulu from time to time.  I've gotten locked out here and there.  It's an annoyance, but, I'm of the opinion that keeping mom happy though such minor things is a net win.  Doubly so for the MIL.  Honestly.  For less than $20 this whole problem can go away.  Just have your BF sign her up for whatever service it is, then cancel it when she's done watching.  It's not a lot of money, and it's worth it to keep things copasetic.    It's basically the cost of a bouquet of flowers.", "Oh sweet summers child the whole family is using your accounts. Log them all off and change your password (say your password was hacked). Never stoop to asking permission to use something u pay for, it\u2019s yours.\nNta", "NTA change all your passwords and do not share it.", "NTA.\n\nChange the password on the other account and don't give the new one out - even to your boyfriend. Those are yours, you pay for them, you decide if and when you want to share. Your bf, if he is so intent that his mom gets to watch what she wants, when she wants, is perfectly able to buy her her own subscription, paid out of his pocket. He can not like your stance all he wants.", "NTA and change your passwords", "You\u2019re NTA \nIf you really wanted to keep the peace and she \u201conly wants to watch one thing\u201d you could give it her and then once she has had time to watch it you log in and change the passwords.  \n\nWhich is what you should do with the account she already has access to.  Change the password.  She wanted to watch one thing - not have permanent access.  \nIf permanent sharing is what is required of you then you need to tell your boyfriend that you\u2019re canceling your account and he needs to make a new one that he shares with his family.  If you feel comfortable chipping in for a portion and access then that\u2019s cool but then the responsibility of sharing passwords and payments is on him.  And if you get frustrated that you can never get on because they\u2019re using it, you can go back to having your own.   Win/win.", "NTA.  My wife doesn't even have them, I log her devices in for her (it's just easier since I an tech oriented and the passwords are long and complicated).\n\nEdit:  Just wanted to add, go change your passwords.", "NTA. Only one person other than you were supposed to access that account. Most accounts allow at least 2 at a time, which means more than the ONE person you had authorized were using the service you paid for. Change the password and tell your boyfriend his family fucked up and are now reaping the rewards of their streaming greed.\n\nAlso, we share logins with a friend who shares their logins with us as we subscribe to different services.", "0 actually know you're not. But also this, most of those streaming things are now putting a tight lid on it where giving out passwords to family and friends is getting to the point where you can't do it anymore. I would tell them that.", "Change your password immediately and don't share it, period.  You're definitely being taken advantage of.  NTAH.", "NTA..  if it's one specific show I'd let her have it for that date then next time you log in, change the password.  She will get tired of asking for updates.", "I am all, my account, you don't get to use it unless you are with me. lol.\n\nMy grandma used to say, \"If in doubt, don't.\"\n\nSo, don't.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nTell your boyfriend to get it for his family. Or flip the tables and have some of your family ask him for his password. Then see his reaction.\n\nPersonally, I'd have told them that I wasn't comfortable with it due to all the cracking down some of these companies are doing now. You don't want to end up being fined or banned. I'm pretty sure that none of them would help you in return.", "op=nta\n\nBut your boyfriend is saying he doesn't respect your boundaries at all, that what's yours is his(/his family).  Is everything that is his also yours?  Is his family's stuff yours?\n\nStop pleasing people.  Change password on first streaming service and refuse on second.  \nIf it's ONE show, she can do a free trial, stream it for one month and cancel OR find some other sucker to leech off of.", "NTA - It is your account and they have taken advantage of you before. But, you really do have a problem, well two. Your BF is one and you being a \"people pleaser\" at the expense of yourself is the other.", "NTA My husband gave his sister the password to my service. She immediately went and deleted my profile and add hers.  Sometimes you give people an inch and they take a mile.", "NTA. But please OP get a spine", "NTA. This is ridiculous.", "Good for you--but I will say if the person in the group chat was watching \"The Game\", they probably weren't reading your \"fess up\" message.", "I love that Mummsy dearest can't ask OP directly but that request goes through the telephone game(maybe she didn't ask for password, but something else entirely.... LOL).", "I have to keep a list of logins for myself. I never remember them.", "Sure, but his wife would have seen it\u2026.   She responds 24/7/365 in seconds.. no matter where she is or what she\u2019s doing.", "Netflix has cracked down a lot.  I got the 4 stream service many, many years ago and have always shared with my niblings.  Last month they couldn't get on any more.    \n\n\nI cancelled.  \n\n\nI don't watch it much any more; prefer Amazon.", ":)", "They go up and down, there are always alternatives too.", "Attacker is always up", "Piratebay"]}
