Second I wore a face mask because of an important work trip and I wanted to care for my health and unless someone was desperate to have a picture with my face visible I see no reason why I had to take it off. Third I dont appreciate being told I'm over reacting when I made my boundaries perfectly clear in advance and accepted to be uninvited to the wedding if you were not willing to compromise of them the fact you and your husband did its extremely disrespectful and entitled. Due to this reasons I decided I'm no longer interested in a frienship with you or your husband and least not in the near future specially without a proper apology. I hope you'll be more mindfull how you treat your other friends in the future  goodbye.\"  Send it and then block her in as many plataforms as possible then be done with her", "NTA but your friends are!", "NTA for leaving but I would have left the gift.
