She might actually be helped by you leaving, if it motivates her to get the support she clearly needs.\n\nIn the meantime, go out, live life, love and laugh and invite her along if she wants. Her illness is hers to manage and your life is yours to live. Don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.

And I don't mean to be callous, but it's going sound that way.... Your girlfriend is sucking the life out of you. You're not married, you don't have children together, you're not obligated to her. I admire your heart - not wanting to leave her for fear she may harm herself - but you are not responsible for her actions, nor her emotions or her wellbeing. You are not her father, her therapist nor her caregiver. You are a young man who has his whole life ahead of him. There is little doubt this relationship will end - one can not be sustained with these issues. Might as well mosey on out before you've damaged all your other relationships with friends. There are of course ebs and flows in relationships, but they're supposed to make your life easier and pleasant, and breathe life into you - not drain you of all joy.", "She sounds emotionally manipulative and has managed to isolate you from everyone you know and formed an unhealthy dependency  and expecting you to take all the burden on, does she actively actually try and help herself or are you expected to just take the brunt of everything because the depression is the excuse for everything including isolating you from everyone?\n\nNTA, if she can have the capability to help her brother she can have the ability to be by herself for a few hours while you visit your friend, to be honest the relationship sounds abusive and unhealthy", "Your girlfriend takes no responsibility for her illness. She verbally abuses you. She isolates you from outside relationships. She prioritizes her wants and needs while completely disregarding yours. She has made you take the role of her caretaker when you are her partner. These are not the actions of someone who cares about you. These are not the actions of someone invested in you. \n\nRelationships are give and take. It won\u2019t always be 50/50. But you both have to be able to step up to the plate and help the other when help is needed. She isn\u2019t stepping up for you. Women like her, people like her, will never \u201cfill your cup\u201d. They will drain you and take from you, and when you have nothing left to give, they will leave, and find someone else they can emotionally drain. This is a life lesson and a relationship lesson that will repeat itself until it is learned.  \n\nNTA. That said, you are allowing someone to mistreat you and I hope that changes soon. You\u2019ve got an extremely limited amount of time on this earth, and all the \u201cguaranteed\u201d days you\u2019ll *ever get* will be the ones of the past.

I was your girlfriend, with a partner as amazingly supportive as you are currently being. \n\nIt's absolutely commendable and understandable that you want o be there for her, and it sounds like you are. A lot. But making yourself unhappy, in this situation, isn't going to make her happier. It's just going to hurt everyone.\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that I got better when I lost a relationship where I was allowed to constantly cater to my depression, instead of facing it.

While I understand how difficult dealing with depression is for both the person who has it and those who love them, you can't allow her illness to take over your life. My therapist once told me about the Oxygen Mask Rule: You have to help/take care of yourself before you can help others.\n\nHave you talked to your girlfriend about how your friendships have suffered and how close you are to ending the relationship over this? Would a pet be an option, to give her companionship for when you've got a meetup schedule and she either isn't invited or doesn't want to go? Does your girlfriend have the option to come for a little while, either leaving when she's out of batteries or joining you late after she has a chance to recharge?

Your friendships and your happiness are important.", "NTA - AND RUN!!!  You are NOT her therapist, nor her medication.  She has been in therapy since she was EIGHT.  You are seeing the spiral your life is taking with her, DO YOU WANT THAT TO CONTINUE?  \n\nIf you leave, HER CHOICES ARE HER CHOICES! You will NOT be responsible for how she does, good or bad.  But YOU deserve a normal life.", "you are putting all the blame on her illness, and not her, and completely negating any responsibility from her. the thing is she is responsible. actions may explain but they do not excuse. insulting you and emotionally manipulating you is unacceptable. it seems like its at a point where you need to stand up for yourself and walk away. that does NOT mean you were not there for her, or that you dont care for her. for once you need to prioritize yourself. youre possibly just building more and more resentment for her which wont help either of you. NTA", "NTA. I have clinical depression, among other things, but clinical depression does not make you jealous of your partner having or spending time with friends (especially opposite sex friends). Being easily jealous is not related to depression, it's a personality trait, and I'm guessing that many other aspects of her personality are also being written off as part of her illness. If you have depression, it's your job to manage it and do the best you can to seek treatment and minimize the impact it has on your loved ones. If she's been in therapy for 15 years and is still this bad, perhaps she should seek a different therapist, or resume going to therapy (every time I read that someone with mental health issues has stopped going to therapy but is still suffering from a mental illness, it's a HUGE red flag for me). But honestly? I think you need to go, man. I mean, you did a quantitative analysis of the impact she's having on your own mental health (tip of my cap to you for that), you've written about how you've lost almost all of your friends because you need to be on-call for her all the time, and now her behavior is jeopardizing the last few friendships you have. She is isolating you from your social support network, and that's abusive. Mental health issues do not excuse abuse.", "I say this as someone who has been in therapy for a long time with multiple therapists.  \n\n\nNTA  \n\n\nYour gf is making you responsible for her all the time and that's just not sustainable. Even professional home health aides get time off. If she's this seriously depressed, she needs to consider IOP (intensive outpatient treatment) or even inpatient treatment. Having you give up your life is not the answer and it's clearly not helping her. You need to have a serious talk with her about treatment options, but also that you need to be able to have a life. If she's not willing to consider anything else but full time emotional support bf, then for your own well being please break up with her.", "NTA.  You're attempting to be in a relationship with someone who isn't available to be in one because of her depression.  You aren't obligated to set yourself on fire to keep her warm.", "NTA, talk to her how you feel you have lost friendships and that you want to retain the ones you still have. \n\nMake it clear that you also want her to be a part of those friendships but if she does not that you still want to keep them.\n\nYou love and care about her but you also need this for your wellbeing.", "NTA for wanting to go to the party. you should not have to lose that many friends because of her dependency issues. you also shouldnt be unhappy at least 60% of the time.", "NTA - having had a relationship similar to yours in the past (albeit shorter than yours), I can say you may very well be better off leaving her. Your significant other cannot be the only important person in your life. That's not healthy. The fact that's she's mad at you for trying to have a social life is Bad. What happens if you get depressed and can't take care of her anymore? There's being supportive and then there's trying to fill from an empty cup.", "Nta she survived before you", "Seems like she\u2019s using mental health issues as a way to hide her possessive nature. I struggle with depression and anxiety but still want my partner to have friends and fun. Stop enabling her behavior. Breaking up w her might be the kindest thing you do for her.", "NTA and as someone struggling significantly with failing mental health at the moment while studying to be a therapist,  I will say this loud and clear: \n\nYOUR MENTAL HEALTH IS NOBODYS RESPONSIBILITY BUT YOUR OWN \n\nIt's one thing to offer support but entire reliance on someone else is not okay. She has to make the effort on her part. I got the following advice from a therapist I saw for five years and she told me during one of our first few sessions. I still think about it today: \n\nNobody in the world is going to be able to answer every one of your phone calls. Nobody will ever be 100% available to you. It's fine to rely on the support of others sometimes but you need to be able to help yourself as well.", "First, my credentials. I\u2019m nearly 40. I\u2019ve been in therapy off and on since I was 4. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 12, anxiety in my 30\u2019s. I spent 6 weeks in the grippy sock day program Feb-March 2020 ( that\u2019s a wild story, being in the nuthouse while the world loses it mind). I\u2019ve been alone in my condo for the entire pandemic and unemployed for most of it. My father has been on just about every anti depressant there is. My grandmother was institutionalized in the 60\u2019s. I know about depression. \n\nWhat you are describing isn\u2019t depression anymore. That\u2019s codependency and enmeshment. She isn\u2019t going to get better because she wants things to be the way they are now. She\u2019s using her diagnoses to emotionally manipulate you. A true partner, even at their lowest, will still want the best for you. You are experiencing caregiver\u2019s syndrome, where you are giving every ounce of yourself to keep someone else afloat.

You are not responsible for your girlfriend. If she's been on meds and on and off therapy for 15 years and acting like this, then it seems like she's just unfortunately the type of person that just doesn't want to help themselves. Even at my lowest point in life I would never have tried to control someone or use my depression as a weapon against someone.

What about 30 years from now, when you\u2019re still with this woman, she\u2019s not gotten any better as you\u2019re still doing everything for her, and you don\u2019t love her but haven\u2019t left because you\u2019re scared of what *could* happen?\n\nWould you rather feel like you wasted 3 years, or 30?\n\nLook. Life is hard. But, your gf is an adult. If she falls, she **must** learn to pick herself back up. By helping her, you\u2019re not helping her.\n\nI hope you\u2019re ok with whatever you choose to do, at the end of the day it\u2019s *your* life, you\u2019re the one who has to live it.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f", "Or will you be throwing away the next years of your life and your friends?  Dude, I support YOU, but you need to care enough about yourself to not drown trying to save her."]}
