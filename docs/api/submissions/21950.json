If she is unwilling to listen, leave it on her parents/siblings to take care of the rest and help as needed.", "NTA His time to tell her was from the beginning, as in not lying at all. The phrase \"no good deed goes unpunished\" comes to mind. You and the other investigators did the right thing.", "NTA her anger is misplaced.

At least she is moving forward with her eyes wide open. I think, at this point, the best you can do is just stay out of it and be there in case she needs you. Perhaps her mother can convince her that at a minimum, the house should remain in her name, and there should be a prenup if they get married. If he truly loves her, then he won\u2019t have a problem with signing.", "NTA.  If all you did was some basic internet digging, that's pretty standard stuff, especially when you saw she was about to invest her money with this guy.

I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I knew all that stuff and didn't say anything while she buys a house with a guy who is lying to her and likely can't pay his share.  If I were the cousin I would be \\*furious\\* at you if you knew all that and said nothing.", "NTA\n\nYou were trying to do right by your cousin. It's not like you do research on all of them, you got warning signs. Unfortunately this scammer has already gotten to her, and it'll take a lot to convince her he's not legitimate. Classic cognitive dissonance, it's sometimes easier to believe him then accept she was fooled.\n\nThe only thing I'd say is that if she does come back to her senses, and hasn't done anything too terrible, be kind to her.

I'd hope my loved ones did this for me if I ever fell for a con-person.", "NTA\n\nThe context here makes your choices reasonable. The guy was making extravagant lies to numerous members of her family and lots of you saw red flags with that. Boyfriend shouldn't have lied, these are the consequences of his actions.", "NTA but your cousin is a fool as she stands by him. I kind of get if someone tells a white lie or has a tiny personal thing they only tell later on in the relationship about something (small) but it sounds like he made up a LOOOT of things. He sounds like a notorious liar maybe a narcissist and would have never told the truth. And also what does that even mean he would have told the truth on his time? Like it's kind of if you had one tiny secret or so but he made up straight lies. Wth", "NTA. That your cousin got upset is understandable and  people in love don\u2019t always respond to negative information about their romantic partner rationally, but if this guy was already lying chances are he will lie about other things.

It\u2019s one thing to look into someone\u2019s past just for the sake of being nosy and a completely different thing to do it for the well-being of someone you love.

Not one person in the family voiced concerns to op cousin about her relationship. They went into pi mode to try and find dirt first and it makes it seem like they feel that their family member is to naive and helpless to protect herself. Of course family should be concerned when they feel that someone they love is being deceived but from op cousin perspective this could easily read that the family just could not let the her be happy in her relationship so they had to make sure it was fake as fast as they could. Instead of voicing their concerns to her first that the story was to good to be true and she needed to slow down for a second because they care for her and had some concerns about the situation, they all smiled and went along with the relationship and then sprung it on her all at once. I think this is a very sensitive situation and for op cousin it felt like the whole family was ganging up on her and going behind her back to spoil her happiness. That is the opposite of what the family wanted but that is the outcome they got. That is why she is pushing back and withdrawing. Now she is hurt because she was manipulated by both sides. Hopefully she sees for herself that this story that his intentions were not pure and her family was only looking out for her but she is going to have to see that for herself now that she has been presented with the facts.

And I\u2019ve been there when she\u2019s been caught in a lie- she\u2019ll explain it away with oh, I didn\u2019t say that or you misunderstood. We have zero relationship now because it\u2019s hard to be close to someone who knows the truth. She\u2019s cut all of us off. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s made up some lies about me- probably to explain why we aren\u2019t close. The last time I saw her, I noticed some of her friends giving me the dirtiest looks. Who knows what she said?\nIt\u2019s not a good life and not one she wants to be a part of, but she\u2019ll have to learn on her own. Hopefully before she marries him. One of the tactics these types use is to cut their partner off from their family- I\u2019ve seen my sister do it with several guys. Be there for your cousin- he is already putting the blame for HIS lies and exposure on you, he is manipulating her to make himself the good guy and her family the bad.", "NTA.\n\nMy step-sister's boyfriend raised a ton of red flags for me. Like you, I Googled him and found out all kinds of stuff about him, including that he had two children he never mentioned and that he lied about his entire backstory. After they broke up, he forged a check to steal money from her dad. Nice guy. I also Googled her next boyfriend and found a video of him running over a cop's foot with his car (literally every comment on YouTube called him an asshole). I never told her about any of it because we're not close (our parents met after we were adults), so I didn't feel it was my place, but sometimes I regret it. I think if she'd become engaged I would've at least showed what I found to her parents or her sister, as they're closer to her.\n\nObviously I don't think you did anything wrong. You weren't doing it to be mean, you did it because you noticed his lies. I'd understand your cousin being embarrassed, but she should be grateful to you for saving her from this guy. Also, I highly doubt he was ever going to come clean. He's just angry he lied and trying to blame you, but there was nothing preventing him from telling the truth from the start. There's no excuse for what he did and no reason to believe anything he says now. If someone wants to keep their background private from the extended family, fine, but don't lie to the person you're dating.\n\nPersonally I don't understand why anyone wouldn't Google a new partner. I'd like to think people are trustworthy, but it's worth double-checking when you're letting someone into your life. I Google guys I go out with, but if I didn't or if I missed something, I'd hope one of my friends/family checked too if they had a bad feeling about the guy.
