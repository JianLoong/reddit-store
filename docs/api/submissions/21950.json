If she is unwilling to listen, leave it on her parents/siblings to take care of the rest and help as needed.", "NTA His time to tell her was from the beginning, as in not lying at all. The phrase \"no good deed goes unpunished\" comes to mind. You and the other investigators did the right thing.", "NTA her anger is misplaced.

At least she is moving forward with her eyes wide open. I think, at this point, the best you can do is just stay out of it and be there in case she needs you. Perhaps her mother can convince her that at a minimum, the house should remain in her name, and there should be a prenup if they get married. If he truly loves her, then he won\u2019t have a problem with signing.", "NTA.  If all you did was some basic internet digging, that's pretty standard stuff, especially when you saw she was about to invest her money with this guy.

I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I knew all that stuff and didn't say anything while she buys a house with a guy who is lying to her and likely can't pay his share.  If I were the cousin I would be \\*furious\\* at you if you knew all that and said nothing.", "NTA\n\nYou were trying to do right by your cousin. It's not like you do research on all of them, you got warning signs. Unfortunately this scammer has already gotten to her, and it'll take a lot to convince her he's not legitimate. Classic cognitive dissonance, it's sometimes easier to believe him then accept she was fooled.\n\nThe only thing I'd say is that if she does come back to her senses, and hasn't done anything too terrible, be kind to her.

No, you got caught lying.", "NTA - as long as it's done legally and it was done to protect. I'd hope my loved ones did this for me if I ever fell for a con-person.", "NTA\n\nThe context here makes your choices reasonable. The guy was making extravagant lies to numerous members of her family and lots of you saw red flags with that. Boyfriend shouldn't have lied, these are the consequences of his actions.", "NTA but your cousin is a fool as she stands by him. I kind of get if someone tells a white lie or has a tiny personal thing they only tell later on in the relationship about something (small) but it sounds like he made up a LOOOT of things. He sounds like a notorious liar maybe a narcissist and would have never told the truth. And also what does that even mean he would have told the truth on his time? Like it's kind of if you had one tiny secret or so but he made up straight lies. Wth", "NTA. That your cousin got upset is understandable and  people in love don\u2019t always respond to negative information about their romantic partner rationally, but if this guy was already lying chances are he will lie about other things.

It\u2019s one thing to look into someone\u2019s past just for the sake of being nosy and a completely different thing to do it for the well-being of someone you love.

The cousin is understandably hurt, but still she needed to know", "I'd also do some digging to see if maybe he already has a family somewhere else.", "Yeah spil!\n\nAnd the balls of the guy being angry for not being given the chance to tell the truth the first fucking time round", "I\u2019ll bring the popcorn! \ud83c\udf7f", "NTA for doing digging when something feels off.\n\nBut absolutely YTA for not going straight to your cousin with concerns about her partner. No need to involve auntie when cousin is out of college. It was cousin\u2019s choice how to deal with that info, but you took away that option. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that\u2019s why she\u2019s backed into a corner with her BF.", "[removed]", "NTA - as long as it's done legally and it was done to protect. I'd hope my loved ones did this for me if I ever fell for a con-person.", "Hopefully your cousin will calm down. People whose experience lonely hearts scams are often very angry and anxious afterward.", "This almost sounds like Iliza Schlesinger's movie plot, Good on Paper.", " His chance to be truthful with her came when they met.", "\"but if you truly loved me, and didn't care about money, you wouldn't ask me to sign anything like that! I would never even dream of asking you to sign something like that!\"\n\nNevermind the fact he has nothing the cousin could ever take, assets or otherwise, this is the type of line he'd respond with and she will go along with if she's far enough into this creeps grasp. It's can be unbelievable what con artists are able to convince their victims of.", "Yes I agree completely with all of this. I've messaged her to tell her I love her, unconditionally and without bound. I would never turn my back, knowing what I know, I will always be there for her and all the family feel the same", "Was your aunt already concerned because she had her doubts previously", "How old is he? Is that his real name? Did tax payers pay for a name change and relocation after a prison release for protection?", "This exists somewhere in media where the guy invents all of these things to impress the woman and none of it was real and I can't remember what it is.", "Probably not, Mrs Jackson. At this point it\u2019s more likely he is actually four eels in a suit.", "And isolating someone from their family/friends is textbook abuser tactics.\n\nPoor cousin", "Bad bot", "Aladdin", "Where does it say he got a name change? I missed that.", "there's a lot of documentaries and series based on true crimes of this general nature. \n\nSad to say there is not one specific example of a man falsifying his history, making outlandish lies to con well off women into marrying them, there are several I can think of off the top of my head and probably literally thousands if not hundreds of thousands of tales like this.", "I have searched up everyone of my friends boyfriends and found out one had a domestic charge.", "Tinder Swindler? He was like a ponzi scheme of love scams.", "I'd hope my loved ones did this for me if I ever fell for a con-person.", "Yes, the OP was promised Arabian Nights.", "Nowhere. I'm saying if he lied about his life he could be lying about anything. Why would he lie? Most people lie to cover up something bad or others would see as unsavoury.", "that is one example, but I can think of several others off the top of my head, both \"based on true story\" series and documentaries that cover this form of manipulation and abuse. It's a disturbingly frequent type of situation in the world."]}
