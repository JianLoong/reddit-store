NTA OP!!!\n\nThat\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean *everyone* gets a free pass. You still have to make money from the job you do and you\u2019re allowed to make an exception.\n\nThe one thing though is the way you phrased it to the parents, from how you typed it out here it sounds like it may have been very harsh sounding. But if she\u2019s not willing to pay someone for their service, they don\u2019t receive that service.\n(Edited for possible judgement flair)", "ESH:  you could have said \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my space for free students is booked. But I have time for paid students\u201d. No need to be rude, even if it is true\n\nAnd WTF that kids have to pay for their own lessons? Are these adult children with jobs? So your brother / SIL ate TA for that.", "YTA, a major one at that. Most people take lessons to improve in something they love, not necessarily to do it for a living or become worldly famous for it. Your attitude of \"she sucks and unless she pays, she's not worth teaching\" is cruel, obnoxious and is more a reflection of you, not your niece.  You should be ashamed.", "ESH\n\nAs someone offering a service, you have a right to charge certain prices and customers and if they cannot pay, then they cannot enjoy the service. I understand that you need to earn a living and actually money off of teaching, not start offering free classes to anyone who may be somewhat related to you because that would be a waste of your time.\n\nHowever, as a teacher, you should know not to say to parents' faces that their child \"doesn't have talent\" so you don't want to \"waste your time\" with them - what response were you expecting from that? While she may not have talent, she may have certain skills or can build skills and ability through painting classes which you can charge for. No one would be happy to hear that about their child, especially coming from someone within the family.\n\nAs an adult and teacher, you should know how to handle those situations professionally and not take it as an attack on you/your prices, but just explain why you do need to charge SIL, even in the simplest of ways. E.g. I do not charge my niece as she has a natural talent for art, I enjoy teaching her, don't want her natural talent to go to waste and she cannot afford art classes. However, teaching your daughter requires building necessary skills for painting and developing a better understanding of the art form that she may not have just yet. This will take more time and materials, and therefore, I do need to be compensated it.", "YTA-   You could have just said that the step daughter is a beginner and needs to master some basics.  You could have suggested some books or YouTube resources in paint or drawing.  \n\nYou didn\u2019t have to call her a waste of your precious talent.  You were rude.", "Yikes, YTA \n\n>whatever, I teach anyone with any level.\n\n- apparently not, as teaching her would be a \"waste of time.\" Art is beneficial to every skill level, you're definitely being an AH to your step-niece.", "ESH, you are NTA for not teaching your brother's stepdaughter for free but calling teaching her a waste of time was way out of line. Your SIL is an obvious AH for trying to join in on someone else getting something for free.", "INFO: Isn't the point of lessons to learn and improve? Kinda sounds weird to reject someone for being bad at it at the start.\n\nOr is it a waste of time as she is the step daughter?", "NTA for not wanting to give free lessons. Your SIL was very presumptuous to expect that from you. But you could have been a *lot* more tactful. No one likes to hear that their child is a waste of time.", "ESH - SIL has absolutely no right to demand free lessons, REGARDLESS of how many you do or with whom.  Her demands is just entitlement.\n\nHowever you were cruel.  The niece is still a kid, talk crap about her because you don't want to spend your free time with is immature and hateful.\n\nNext time try the Grey Rock Method:a simple - i have limited free time. I get to choose how I spend it.  \nRepeat as necessary", "NTA\n\nYou're going to get a lot of people telling you that you are in the wrong because \"Ew, you were so mean for telling the blunt truth\". No. Your SIL tried to take advantage of you for free. You shut that the hell down right quick. And you can bet SIL now knows there is no amount of pressure or whining that will change your mind. Sometimes the truth hurts. She's a big girl. She should not have attempted to exploit you and you likely would have said nothing.", "YTA not for deciding who you teach and don\u2019t teach for free - that\u2019s your call - but for not recognizing that you have a *skill* not exclusively some innate talent. You literally *teach painting* because after a certain point it\u2019s a learned skill. \n\nFrom one artist to another fucking yikes. I\u2019d pull my kid from your lessons even if they were free just because I wouldn\u2019t want them to *learn* your attitude. Terrible role model / teacher moment. Good luck haha.", "Not sure why so many people think you owe it to someone to give their kid free lessons. Apparently you saw something special that you wanted to help develop in your niece, but that doesn't somehow mean that you no longer get paid for your services otherwise. If people want the lessons, they pay the market value. NTA", "YTA. Not because you owe your less talented niece free lessons, but because you were so rude about it. It would have lost you $0.00 to politely tell her mother that you couldn't take on any more unpaid students, you *chose* to say it in the most insulting way possible", "YTA. \n\nYou were rude and unprofessional in your approach.", "INFO: How old is your niece and how old is the stepdaughter?", ">but her daughter simply doesn't have talent so I'm not gonna waste my time with her. \n\nThat comment alone makes YTA.\n\nFor someone who claims to be an artist you sure do like to crush peoples spirit. Art is for everyone, its such an amazing practice. So what if her skill level was that of a child. With practice that could be improved. I hope you have a better attitude to your clients who aren't talented or do they just buy your goodwill because they are paying", "There's a difference between nurturing an obvious talent and giving lessons to anyone who shows an interest. You were a little too blunt to your SIL, but I don't know if that's what was needed to get her to hear you. But I do understand what you're doing for your niece. NTA.", "You know how if you have good credit history and you have lots of money saved up, you can get a much better mortgage rate than someone who is poor, has less savings, and has a worse credit history? \n\nIn other words, the system is weighted to give an extra advantage to someone who already has a leg up, and to make things more difficult for those who have less? \n\nThat's pretty much what you're doing with your nieces. And hey, you're the bank... I mean... Artist, so you get to make the rules. It's your time and you can use it however you want. But don't expect to be seen as fair or egalitarian when you do. Your actions - particularly towards family members - don't happen in a bubble.", "Teaching is a JOB. She didn\u2019t say no she asked for compensation. FOR A JOB.\n\nOffering a favor to one person doesn\u2019t make you owe one to another.", "Isn't this a repost???\n\nYou're still an AH for how you told both of them.", "Yta so why the hell would they pay for lessons if you flat out just tell them their daughter is a waste of your time? Why would literally anybody take lessons from you in that case if you take clients and think the whole time \u201cthis person sucks and I\u2019m not actually going to bother\u201d like you sound scammy as fuck", "n t a for teaching your niece for free but not your brother's stepdaughter...\n\nbut absolutely yta for framing it as a matter of talent. i am sure you could have come up with a more graceful excuse  but you really had to just insult the girl to her mom", "Yeah, YTA here. Nobody is born with artistic talent; an artistic EYE, maybe -- talent come from practice and theory. For all you know she could be an amazing artist but you don't think she's outright \"special\" enough or something.\n\nYou are clearly an artist yourself, so you should know that it took time and practice and guidance to get where you are today.\n\nYou can be an asshole, that's fine, but keep in mind you ARE an asshole here, probably more so because of the special treatment you give to someone you don't have to try as hard to teach.", "YTA. Yes, you do get to choose how you spend your time, to whom you offer your services, and how much you charge. I understand these two have very different talent levels, but I just don\u2019t see a way around the fact that this comes across as you saying the stepdaughter is less than and giving two family members different treatment. You can do what you want, but it just makes you look bad and your family is going to react accordingly.", " Your SIL is TA because she made a grab for something you freely offered to your niece and once her daughter asked you and you said you would need to be paid, she had no right to question your reasons. But you're YTA also, because you did not need to be so rough. You could have said that you offered to teach your niece for free because she shows real talent, but that   \n your step-niece is not at that level, and you don't want to take her on for free. You did not have to say that SIL's daughter does not have talent\u2014doesn't matter how true it is, it did not need to be said\u2014and there's no reason to tell a parent that you don't want to waste your time with their kid.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do shit for people for free. You can do stuff for people for free, but you get to be the decider of that.", "YTA. You don\u2019t owe them free lessons, but you didn\u2019t have to be an asshole when you refused. There are polite ways to say things.", "\u201c I told her that my niece is an amazing artist and it would be such a waste of talent if no one helped her so I'm using my free time to teach her but her daughter simply doesn't have talent so I'm not gonna waste my time with her.\u201d\n\nYTA because of that comment right there. You can choose to offer your services for free to anyone you want, but you didn\u2019t have to be such a rude and condescending AH to your SIL. There are better ways of saying that you are teaching your niece in your free time and are unable to take on additional students in that time.", "NTA\n\nNiece has a *scholarship*, or you could call it a *grant* due to her talent.", "NTA. You're worth money, just because you've taken your niece, doesn't mean this is a literal free-for-all. Be less harsh next time, and specify in your wording from this point on that your niece is your APPRENTICE. Key word difference. It'll make niece feel special, and it'll ward off choosing beggars because that seems different enough from student. It's also kind of true, she isn't a student of yours learning the basics, she's potentially learning at a high enough level to teach as well (possibly even with you! Maybe you could run art classes together when she's older).", "YTA OP Instead of addressing the fact that you teach for living and your niece was an exception, you went straight to insult her daughter.", "NTA; give lessons for free to who you want;everyone else can pay.", "NTA.  You definitely should have been more tactful - there is no reason to be cruel or insulting - but you owe it to nobody to do anything for free... much less stuff that you actually charge money for as a regular course of business.", "ESH except the kids. No one is entitled to free art lessons... but your reasoning is shitty, and your actions don't exist in a vacuum. Your decision-making here is absolutely going to feel like favouritism to the kids. Meanwhile, it's complete bullshit to act as though art lessons are a \"waste of time\" if someone doesn't have natural talent. Art lessons have all kinds of benefits to people, especially children, besides just \"getting better at technique.\" Someone who cares about art should want to nurture a _love of art_ within the children in their life, not just skill.", "NTA.

My brother was \"naturally gifted,\" as my family would say, in drawing (don't get me wrong, can't stand the man (whole different story), but he is indeed extremely talented. I, on the other hand, wasn't \"naturally gifted,\" but I absolutely LOVED to doodle and draw. I was told to stop copying my brother and find my own thing. So I gave up art basically all together. I'm 30 now, and I'm a digital artist/graphic designer for a living. Why? Because 4 years ago I had an amazing man convince me to try again and spent time TEACHING me!! And now, 4 short years later, it's how I make a living.  \n\nOps view is egotistical and vile. Just because someone is good at something doesn't mean it's what they want to do for a living. Just because someone isn't good at something to begin with doesn't mean that they can't become great. Does it mean that they'll become an artist, no, but if they enjoy it, it should be encouraged!! Life is full of dark shitty days, having an outlet like art is AMAZING and how dare they dim that by telling this child she has to pay because she's \"bad\" and a \"waste of time\", unless she pays.

Definitely love a finished product but I agree 100% practice is everything!", "thank you, my folks are artists, and i did art shows with them through my early 20s. it was a conversation that happened from time to time - skill vs talent. skills can be taught, talent is something you're born with. i happen to believe everyone is talented, it's just in what that varies. but not everyone hones skills, and that takes serious work. i don't think either is superior to the other, but they are both very real.", "Yup.  I know people who are way better at design than I am.  It\u2019s a combination of talent and inspiration, and practice at getting that inspiration down in a physical form.

The colors are equally hard between painting and knitting.  If you don\u2019t pick right, both suck.  I\u2019ve seen terrible knitting choices, and terrible painting choices.
