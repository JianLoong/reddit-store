The ceremony went great and the reception was going well. Just after we ate, my FIL and best man spoke, then my SIL. All was going smoothly until she brought up an awful time in my life.\n\nA little background: during COVID I lost most of my savings on the business I had unluckily opened in October of 2019. I was also dealing with bad gastrointestinal problems and horrible IBS. I felt like shit, like I had no hope, and getting my life back in order would take forever. \u201cFriends\u201d who had been a part of my business left due to the failure and others due to the medical problems.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e was the only one who supported me and gave me hope. She helped me rebuild my self esteem and eventually my business and I cannot thank her enough. When I was at my lowest, I wrote an emotional note about these feelings and went into detail about all the horrible things i felt both emotionally and physically. I also wrote about how she was my strength and kept me afloat. I told my wife about writing my thoughts, but never showed her the note.\n\nMidway through SIL\u2019s speech, I saw her unfold this dreaded note and start to read it to the audience. Not just the part about my wife but a full paragraph before it where I described how hopeless I felt and the details of my darkest moments from my toughest battles with IBS. I was so embarrassed. My SIL started to cry as she got through the part about my wife and went on to say she \u201cnever knew how bad it was\u201d but \u201cknew our love would overcome anything\u201d.\n\nI got red in the face, stormed out to the back of the venue and lit up a cigarette, which I haven\u2019t had in years. Some family members ran out, but I told them i needed to be alone. I came back after a bit, everyone was eating and dancing, but I was still getting stares and I just felt horrible. My wife comforted me but we didn\u2019t really talk it through since she was entertaining family and whatnot.\n\nAfter the party, I brought it up with my SIL. I told her I felt violated that she would somehow get ahold of that note and not only read it but share it with everyone. I said it hurt because the memory of the wedding certainly felt tainted by the speech and my reaction. She told me she wanted to share a beautiful image of our love and didn\u2019t see anything wrong with it, that it reminded her of when her smoothie business failed and it gave her hope. She even told me it was a \u201ctoxic coping mechanism\u201d to repress those feelings and be ashamed of them. I felt like the convo was going nowhere and we didn\u2019t speak for the rest of the night. It hasn\u2019t helped that distant family and friends have been recommending IBS treatments to me.\n\nMy wife agrees with me but thinks SIL had good intentions. I told her she\u2019s an AH regardless for not even checking with me. SIL hasn\u2019t reached out to apologize yet and I heard from MIL she thinks I\u2019m overreacting and trying to villainize her. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Wow thank you all for the responses! I am trying to respond to each one as soon as I can. Just want to say here that my wife did not know where the note was! I never even told her specifically about the note, just that I liked to journal my thoughts and feelings.", "created_utc": 1669740253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7z2lr/aita_for_storming_out_of_my_wedding_reception/", "score": 545, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not overreacting,  but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for an apology.", "NTA. Who would do that? What the actual fuck?", "NTA.  I\u2019m so sorry she violated your privacy like that.  You are definitely not the asshole.", "NTA.\n\nWhere did she even find this note? Does she have a key to your place because I would be taking that back immediately or changing the locks.", "NTA.  I would also be very concerned how SIL got a hold of that note you gave your spouse. That was a very private moment and at the least she should have checked with you before going there. Her trying to tell you how to grieve or cope is condescending AND inappropriate.", "NTA.  Your SIL was simply wrong to read a personal letter that you wrote during a very stressful time.  Storming off and returning are at least a reasonable reaction to the SIL's speech.  Was she raised under a rock and not aware of how inappropriate her speech content was?", "NTA. You would have been within your rights to whip that note out of her hands and tell her to sit down. Who finds a note that personal and thinks, \u2018Aha, perfect speech material!\u2019? I\u2019ve had IBS and damn it can suck sometimes \ud83d\ude11  also, her response to you when you asked her about it was all about her.

Good luck OP.", "NTA the gall of your SIL is astounding.", "NTA and I have a hard time believing your wife wasn\u2019t in on it. How did SIL even FIND the note? How could she have something you never even showed your wife?? I would be livid. While she\u2019s right you shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of your feelings, SIL should be ashamed of violating such private personal thoughts and feelings. She could\u2019ve summed up the note, or only read the part about how much you love your wife.", "NTA, I don't think her intentions were good.   They weren't necessarily malicious either.   She was hoping to garner attention for giving an incredible,  memorable,  meaningful speech through tapping people's emotions.   She did it by disrespecting you.", "NTA - SIL definitely crossed a line here. That said, the damage is done and you may want to reconcile for the sake of not starting off your marriage on this note - rise above it if you can, but I'd still want an apology if I were you. \n\nalso INFO because I need to ask, how did you lose friends to IBS?", "NTA....even if her intentions were good, she should have checked with you before sharing your personal thoughts and feelings. And even if she wanted to reference that time in your life, she could have paraphrased instead of reading the letter verbatim", "Absolutely NTA. Your SIL is a giant manipulating AH for exposing you publicly without warning, and especially for violating your privacy without consent.\n\nI would also seriously question how she got the note. Did your wife give it to her, or did the SIL simply steal it from your home?\n\nEither way, she is completely untrustworthy and should not ever be trusted.", "NTA\n\nYour anger might be misplaced though. How did SIL get the note in the first place? If your wife gave it to her and asked for it to be included in the speech, I would put a lot less of the blame on her. She probably should have double-checked with you, but if she was asked by your wife she may have thought she was good to go.", "NTA \n\nYour wife is though, she clearly gave her that note.", "NTA that B would never be in my presence, home or around my children. And if my spouse didn't like it they could hit the road too.", "NTA\n\nThe road to hell is paved with good intentions. SIL hurt you, publicly humiliated you at your wedding, and openly shared your private medical information. There's no amount of \"good\" intentions that can cover all that.", "NTA. How tf did she even get it?", "NTA, your sister has horrible judgement.", "NTA - It would have been the easiest thing to check if you were okay with someone basically reading your diary in public.  I'm still stuck on how did your SIL get her hands on a note you never showed your wife?", "If my husband sister done a sneaky thing like that all hell would have broken loose", "NTA. You're not over-reacting. Your SIL shared a note you hadn't even shared with your wife. \n\nFound, with or without your bride's assistance (snooping?), concealed from you, and publicly read it. At your wedding reception. \n\nIt was so not her damn place to reveal any of that. To anyone. Ever. \n\nThere are so many damn things wrong with this picture, I can't even begin to understand how your now wife thinks \"best intentions.\" Fuck that, this was deceptive and manipulative at worst, and incredibly ignorant and arrogant at best.", "NTA but you have a wife problem. Why did she share the note? The fact that she did that and ok\u2019d her sister reading it is messed up, not a good way to start a marriage.", "NTA\n\nmight be good intentions on SIL part but TERRIBLE execution and a huge breach of your trust and privacy. It was not her place to read that, or even have it in her possession. \n\nINFO: How did she get it?", "INFO: How did she get her hands on the note?", "NTA.\n\nThat's fucked up. She stole something from you and tried to justify it. Her intentions sound entirely selfish and self-serving. She needs to apologize and it better not be the \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" variety.", "NTA, I don't doubt the SIL had good intentions but that doesn't excuse what she did", "Info: 3 months ago you made another AITA post in which you mentioned in passing meeting up with a match you made on hinge.

You are not overreacting. Your SIL is the villain.", "I especially love the bit where, after sneaking a private note, similar to a diary entry, of your most personal thoughts and emotions, and reading it not only to herself but AT YOUR WEDDING, SIL proceeded to inform you that your feelings about this were incorrect. \n\nShe owes you a massive apology, your wife needs to mediate it, and at minimum every time she comes by you should have a fake diary you joking pretend to rush to hide from her as if she can\u2019t be trusted.", "NTA\n\nSil was wrong that was a private note not meant for a wedding reception. If she was concerned then she should have approached you in private.\n\nYou have nothing to apologize for but sil does.", "Sorry fella, your wife absolutely found that note and set this whole thing up. NTA but your wife is lying to you.", "NTA. You should tell your in-laws and SIL that she should come back down to earth. What the hell's matter with her? Honestly does she have any mental health issues? Does she drink? Do drugs? This was your wedding and she shared some of your most private and intimate thoughts to people you care about. In the comments you mentioned she had a key. A good wake up call is to either demand for the key back or change the locks.", "NTA\n\nIf she tells you again that writing it down was a \"toxic coping mechanism\" let her know that your journaling of it was you getting it out of your system but her reading it aloud in a public event is tantamount to ripping open a healed wound.\n\nAlso, as childish as this may seem, ask her to put herself in your position. \"If I'd done this to you, how would have reacted?\"", "NTA.\n\nThere is zero chance she didn\u2019t know beforehand that this was a complete invasion of both your privacy, and common decency.   Nothing of the sort belongs in a WEDDING SPEECH.\n\nAsk her how she\u2019d feel if during her wedding you roll up with her diary, and discuss how much she hates her mother, is jealous of her sister, and thinks \u2018Davey\u2019 will always be the love of her life\u2026and John is sitting next to her. \n\nI see in a comment she has a key to your house.  Get it back and / or change the locks.  If your wife doesn\u2019t agree with this very reasonable thing, you have just obtained more useful information.", "NTA.   who the fuck talks about IBS in a wedding  speech?", "NTA, but your wife sure is for not shutting that down immediately.  I can't imagine listening to my husbands private feelings from a hard time be used as a speech by my own sibling.  I get your fleeing, but I would have walked up to her and said, 'how dare you steal my private thoughts and spew them during my wedding without my permission\" and walked off after taking the microphone from her.  SIL deserved to be publicly humiliated.  Your wife is an A for not ripping her a new one and cutting all contact.  There are no good intentions when it involves theft and disclosure of private feelings during a public event.  I would not be in the same room with SIL after that nor with anyone that would defend her.  I am so disgusted on your behalf.", "NTA JFC who in their right mind would think giving a wedding speech that focuses on someone's bowel movements appropriate.  I'd tell her Hey, Thanks for ruining the wedding and invading my privacy.", "NTA, at all. She should have cleared talking about such a low point in your life with you before talking about it at all, never mind reading off this note she happened to find somewhere. I don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s difficult for her to comprehend that you don\u2019t want details of your IBS broadcast to the whole family. \n\nI hope she\u2019s being honest about her motivation at least. But the right thing for her to do, I see from your other comments she likely happened across it by chance, would have been not to read it at all, or if she did either keep it to herself or tell you what she saw and be honest about it. This really wasn\u2019t okay \u2014 you only get one chance to do a wedding right after all. Sorry this happened to you.", "You are right, she's AH for not checking in with you after \\*stealing\\* a personal note and then reading \\*out loud\\* to everyone you know!\n\nGood intentions can excuse small hick-ups. This is a MAJOR no-no!\n\nNTA. She needs to seriously apologize and realize that was waaaay out of bounds.   \nYOU were the one who were exposed, why is it HER feelings that matter most?", "NTA, you know your wife gave SIL the note right?", "NTA. But dear God.  No way in hell would I have let her finish reading the note. I would have been yelling at the top of my lungs to create a scene and went right up and ripped the Mic and letter from her hand. \n\nYou obviously have some other problems at play too, like how tf did she even get this letter? Major overstepping of many boundaries. And unless SIL is a licensed psychologist or therapist, her opinion on toxic masculinity or toxic coping mechanisms is irrelevant. She is just trying to save face and not take responsibility for her shitty actions.", "NTA, it\u2019s like reading someone\u2019s diary out", "NTA\n\nShe shouldn't have it. She absolutely shouldn't have read it.  To use it for her own 'moment' is absolutely crazy. \n\nMaybe she did have good intentions. Doesn't change the fact that she was a colossal AH.", "NTA. Your SIL is a major AH and I also would feel extremely violated if someone did that to me. Personally, I would go LC until she gave you a very genuine apology, and even after then I would still be very careful leaving her alone near your personal belongings. She clearly can\u2019t be trusted to have any respect for privacy.", "Faf", "Nta", "Nta but your wife sure is. She's doing alot of defending of her AH sister.

Where did the SIL get the note when OP says he never shared it with anyone including his wife", "Sorry about the late response, i replied to another comment earlier but it may have moved to the bottom:\n\n> My wife did not know the note existed, only that I journaled my thoughts during those dark times.\n\n>I do have a theory though.

Just a theory.", "Exactly what I was wanting to know!", "Does it really matter, though? Would the reason why OP seemingly not being concerned about how she got that note in any way make the SIL not an asshole for doing what she did?", "Yeah I don\u2019t think I will. It seemed like she had no idea it could even be perceived as inappropriate! Like what world are you living on?\n\nI just hope we can find a way to make sure she doesn\u2019t do stuff like this again.", "Thank you for validating my concerns. I felt a little crazy when my SIL was arguing it was normal. Like did you not just tell my whole wedding party I shit my brains out for months at a time?!?! I know I made a scene but in my mind it was justified. Glad to see people agree.", "This! How did she get the note? \n\nHer having it and reading it at your wedding is unacceptable.  \n\nYou are NTA", "She does have a key\u2026 Luckily not to the bathroom though. Don\u2019t need her exposing any more of what goes on in there", "This. If the wife gave that away without his consent to the SIL, he should seriously reconsider that marriage.", "Yeah the comments about how i coped were frustrating. I don\u2019t understand how not wanting to share details about IBS is \u201ctoxic\u201d. She said it all ties into toxic masculinity and \u201cthe system\u201d and whatnot but last time I checked we all shit behind closed doors. Just shocked to hear she thinks that way and that we have such different ideas of what\u2019s normal.", "[removed]", "Well she tapped into something alright. Some very private details!

I hope your wife really is on your side.", "It seems you have the measure of her and her motivations that day.  Hopefully, this will help you to, if not forgive her, maybe correctly assess her opinion of you and so release the pressure she makes you feel, to help you brush off her condescension.

That extreme act gives you the benchmark against which can now judge the validity of her opinions.", "Agreed 100%.

Make sure you use the word diary not journal to convey how deep of a breach of trust this was", "NTA.  OMG, your SIL is not safe.  She assumes she knows better than you do what you want and need, and will label you toxic if you don't agree.  Stay away from her.  I would give MIL a wide berth because after SIL destroys you and tells you to like it, MIL will be patting her on the back and telling you not to be a cry baby.\n\nI hope someone does something just as cringe to her one day.  I also hope her arrogant misjudgment loses her friends.", "NTA", "NTA. Your SIL cannot seem to understand that people can feel differently about things and just because she thinks she would be fine with a private note being read publicly doesn't mean you feel that way. It infuriates me when people tell you how you should feel about something. Men who say women should be flattered by catcalling for example. It's toxic and I think your SIL is toxic too. Do not concede on this and make it clear that she violated your privacy and doesn't get to decide how you should feel about it.", "NTA. Impact is greater than intentions. Your SIL was the AH for taking something private. Sounds like this wasn\u2019t something out in the open for her to just find so who helped her get ahold of something so deeply personal?", "NTA. This is a huge violation of privacy and your wife should be appalled and discussing boundaries with you, so that you both can relay them to SIL as a united front. The fact that none of that is happening is a huge red flag. This is marriage ending stuff OP. That family is justifying SIL's disgusting behavior and will definitely rug sweep this.\n\nI think you should consider couples counseling.", "NTA.   I don't know if your SIL intentionally embarrassed you or if she is clueless about social interactions, but reading that note was SO inappropriate.  I would be furious.", "NTA As the saying goes, \u201cthe road to hell is paved with good intentions.\u201d Her intentions don\u2019t matter in this situation. She violated something very personal for you, something she had zero right to do", "NTA. First and foremost: How did she get the note? Is she rummaging through your things? That is issue #1. As for \"toxic coping mechanisms,\" I highly doubt she's a therapist or knows jack shit about mental health issues. You weren't repressing feelings: You wrote them down. You just didn't publish them/make them public. That's not repression. What she did was a massive violation of privacy and in no way are you the AH. In fact, you were nice as heck, I would have laid into the thief.  \n\n\nTheft and Defamation. I would seriously limit any more time you'd spend around someone like that. I would never do that do a friend, never mind an in law even.", "NTA.  What she did was a massive violation of trust.  She did so without consulting you or your wife.  It\u2019s disgusting.  I get people saying they\u2019re concerned with how she got the note, but the way she handled you saying she crossed a line is eye opening.  Instead of trying to apologize or hear you, she decides to lecture you on why you\u2019re wrong on how you feel.   That is inexcusable.", "NTA she crossed a line, and sad to see your wife defending her.. lol.. good luck with that, cause you're gonna need it", "NTA\n\nI think you handled the situation very well, considering the huge violation that your sil committed, in public, on what should have been the best day ever. I'm sorry that happened to you.\n\nNow the question is: what next?\n\nYour wife should at least see your point of view. She should not, as some have suggested, be an intermediary between you and sil, because that won't work, and it strips everyone involved of dignity. You are a grown man who can advocate for himself, and sil is a grown woman who apparently has no problem taking about anything, anywhere. And your wife didn't cause this, so she shouldn't be put in such an agonizing situation.\n\nExplain it to your wife and sil, and mil if she butts in, like this: Ask them to imagine that they had been raped. \n\nThe rape survivor has every right to share her ordeal with only those whom she chooses to tell, and no one tells her she's toxic! She may feel shame even though she did nothing wrong, and have trouble facing people who know. She certainly has every right to avoid the topic altogether once in a while and focus on happiness! \n\nAsk the new women in your life to imagine that they had journaled about the rape and how despondent they were. And then you had read that journal aloud to people they would have to face everyday. During what was supposed to be a celebration. Without their consent. \n\nExcept that no one committed a crime against you, that's exactly what your sil did to you. She aired something very private and painful. To all your friends and family, during a celebration. Without your consent. Hell, even prosecutors won't force a rape survivor to testify against a suspect, even to save others from the same fate! \n\nIt doesn't matter if you are being a toxic repressed male, or whatever she thinks you are. It doesn't matter how she meant it. She violated your privacy by even keeping the note, and she violated you by sharing it without your consent.\n\nIt definitely doesn't matter if \"that's just how she is.\" Being a habitual asshole doesn't make assholery okay. Your wife definitely needs to understand that, and also that you will not relax your boundaries to accommodate her sister's bad behavior, whatever the cause of it.\n\nI think you should explain sil's actions, and their effect on you, using the rape analogy. Then ask her to apologize for keeping the note, and for reading publicly without your consent. If you're like me, you may need to use email. If she apologizes, great. If she doesn't, or doesn't do it willingly, still fine. As soon as you are able, resume contact with her. Be polite and cheerful, but don't trust her. Don't make anyone choose between the two of you, but be vigilant about maintaining boundaries.\n\nNow, at your age, I wouldn't have been able to hold boundaries with someone like this without being too aggressive or cracking up in anxiety in their presence. I hope you're better off mentally than I was. I needed a lot of therapy. In any case, it might be helpful for you and your wife to go to couples counseling to make sure you handle this in a way that will strengthen your marriage. A challenge like this, faced early and handled correctly, can really give you a good set of tools for the rest of your marriage. That's what happened with my husband and me, over 30 years ago. And you both can learn, together, how to maintain proper boundaries with sil. Because you are a unit now, and you'll both have to maintain boundaries with others in order to operate as a unit. And it will take some skill, because sil is a piece of work!", "NTA, I'm sorry you have the worst SIL in the world.", "NTA, but I don't think the SIL is either, really. Your wife had to have given her that note, and if she got emotional while reading it and went on about how wonderful your relationship is, then she clearly meant well. While I don't think anyone's the outright AH here, it's clear you felt like your privacy was violated, and that's fair. I totally get why you feel that way, and I hope your wife and SIL can respect it too.\n\nI think maybe you, wife, and SIL need to sit down and chat it out. One where everyone's allowed to actually get their feelings + intentions out there and have them be validated and not talked over. I mention intentions because, while I don't think they trump the resulting consequences or feelings, I do think they count for something. Even if it's a small something.\n\nGood luck! I don't think this situation is unsalvageable.", "She read a note that you wrote to your wife that your own wife never actually saw?\n\nNo. Absolutely NTA.", "NTA\n\nI would print out the verdicts here and all of the messages and hide it someplace she\u2019s sure to find and \u201cjournal\u201d how you\u2019re going to publicly embarrass her by reading all of the messages about what an AHole she is.", "I mean, if you find her diary and read the most embarrassing page at her wedding I guess you can be even.", "NTA\n\nShe shared something highly private and got tearful over it as if it impacted her and made her desire for attention the priority, not your privacy.\n\nAs an aside, I've been seeing a gastroenterologist for my IBS. It's infuriating how useless they are, though. Trying low FODMAP rn.", "NTA. At all, that sounds awful, and I\u2019m sorry SIL did that.

Weddings are such a silly concept. You\u2019re essentially throwing a family reunion with two families, only two members of whom actually want/chose to be together, giving them alcohol and a microphone, and expecting things not to get weird.

I read your comment and I don't get the audacity of your SIL to snoop through your stuff, on top of what she did at your wedding (which is unbelievably rude and intrusive WTF). I wish your wife stood up for you because it's her sister, instead of saying she had good intentions. Like no I'm sorry, it seems evil to me, and good intentions or not, this is not okay.", "NTA She basically stole your diary, kept hold of it and read it out at your wedding? She expects forgiveness? Oh hell no. I would never let her step foot in my home again. Does she rifle through drawers? What else has gone missing? I think I'd be calling her a thieving swear word.", "NTA I would go NC with SIL.

Feels like a lot of her information is gathered from TikTok", "Wowwww that actually lines up with something that happened years ago to my SIL you just reminded me of it. She had been dumped by her bf at the time because she would flirt with people at bars for the attention and it was just to get drinks/have fun/feel good. She wouldn\u2019t even consider the idea that flirting might be more meaningful to other people! This is totally kind of a trend I\u2019m starting to see though. She finds some justification for the stuff she does and then everyone else who disagrees just \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand\u201d or something.

Either she sees no problem in the fact that she went through your personal belongings, stole a very personal note/journal entry, and pulled it out in front of you OR she did this deliberately with questionable intent in some kind of bizarre power play; neither is a great look for her.\n\nRead up on boundaries, firm up your own, especially with regard to your wife\u2019s family, and gently support your wife in coming to terms with he fact that her family\u2019s \u2018normal\u2019 might be a bit skewed.", "Oh my goodness.
