Mom insisted we come see her new house and I refused to talk until all the anger boiled over and I told her that I hated her, that I never wanted to see her cheating face again. She told me she was my mom and that I couldn't stay mad at her. I told her she was dead to me. That cheating was one thing, but to try and force me to stay silent, to try and make me keep her nasty secrets. I told her she was nasty, disgusting, that I didn't want to look at her. I was so mad.

Or at the very least for my sister and I to be as close as we once were. I told her we'd talk about it later and I told her family that it was not something that and I needed to talk about.

She blew her marriage up with multiple affairs, she lies and manipulated people to hide her affairs. Then she tried to get you as a child to also lie and manipulate your father.

It's not something people in mostly healthy family dynamics understand. Because in those mostly healthy families there hasn't happened anything bad enough that anyone might think no contact is the best and healthiest solution. It doesn't fit into their world view that a mother can do anything bad enough to warrant a child freeze her out and doing that for eternity.\n\n\n\nSo, the questions in their minds are, will you take their grandchildren from them if they give him too much sugar or not enough toys? The wrong book? A dinosaur sweater instead of a truck? Will they be able to criticize some of your parenting choices or be able to be grandparents and spoil the heck out of the grandkids without you taking that as a reason to keep the kids away? And will their daughter support you? Their boundary pushing is so minuscule compared to what your mother did but it's the only things they can think of because they can't even fathom worse things happening.\n\n\nThey've thought themselves into the corner and they're lashing out before you can freeze them out. They're scared for themselves.\n\n\nSo, if they're otherwise nice enough people, sit them down and talk to them. Tell them that you're so happy that your kids will have awesome grandparents in them and that it's such a relief for you to see them model healthy families for your kids.

As someone who is also estranged from their family, N T A.  Estrangement is a deeply personal and difficult decision that is not made lightly.  I was in therapy for five years before I finally felt brave enough to cut almost everyone off.  It can feel isolating even when you do have people to support you - so hearing that your spouse is challenging you on something you know for yourself to be the best for your peace and health is especially disheartening.\n\nEven worse is two unrelated people who truly have no business dictating the kind of company you keep.  A common phrase I've said to outsiders who feel inclined to talk to me about ending my estrangement is, **\"You know John, but you don't know my dad.\"**  But frustratingly, your in-laws do NOT know your mother and sister.  It's inappropriate and disrespectful for them to insert themselves where they were not wanted or contest your decision.  They have no reason to distrust you, why is this the one thing they can't abide?\n\nYour mom's betrayal of your trust by trying to manipulate you into keeping her secret is, IMO, beyond suitable reason to estrange from her.  I'm not sure if your wife understands exactly, based on her willingness to try and foster a re-connection.  Not that you asked for this, but it might be worth sitting down with her and explaining how your mother's actions deeply impacted you as a child, and how her absence has given you PEACE, which is the ultimate goal of estrangement.  It is solely up to you whether you want to try and repair that relationship because your mother truly did misappropriate her authority as a parent and emotionally destroyed you.  Nobody else gets to make that decision except you.

Healthy family doesn\u2019t mean both sides of the family are involved.", "NTA\n\nYou might want to make it clear to your wife that if she tries to force a reunion or surprise you with your mother, you will divorce her.", "NTA. They want to create a false world where your mom didn\u2019t cause the harm she did indeed cause. It\u2019s not living in reality. I\u2019m sure you would have liked for your things to be different with your mom as well, and it\u2019s something to be grieved, but none of it is your fault. You were wise to step away from her, and your on-laws are intruding. It\u2019s not rude to have boundaries and to stick up for your rights. They don\u2019t have the right to demand this of you.", "NTA. You need to tell your wife and in-laws that they will not like your reaction or the consequences if they continue to pursue this subject. It's not a threat but a declaration that you do not want that woman in your life or your child's. If she's willing to risk this marriage for a stranger then she's not going to like the consequences.", "NTA", "NTA.\nOnly you know what you went through and you still feel the hurt.\nFamily pressure shouldn't make you do things that you don't want to.", "NTA. They should respect your boundaries. They over stepped and obviously don\u2019t give any shits about your feeling.(swallow your feelings and be nice to the woman who made you). I would explain to your wife as gently as possible that y\u2019all are not going to be a family. She understood that for your wedding. she need to understand it\u2019s never going to change and get her family under control. I am so sorry op.", "NTA. Wow, your wife's family really stepped over a line about this.", "NTA! It\u2019s none of your in law\u2019s business.. and your wife needs to except your boundaries. Honestly I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s going behind your back communicating with your mom and letting her visit your baby when you aren\u2019t around.", "NTA.  You weren\u2019t rude, your IL\u2019s are, because your relationship with your family is none of their business and they need to stay in their lane.  BUT - you have a spouse problem, and you need to have a serious talk with her about respecting your boundaries here, make it clear if she doesn\u2019t, it will damage your relationship with her.", "NTA. But people with working family don\u2019t understand.\n\nMaybe you two should figure out some counseling?  Or maybe, think about what would change your mind?  Your mom apologizing whole heartedly?  Something else?\n\nWhat she did was wrong, trying to get you to lie to cover.  If it was just cheating, it the cheating specifically you\u2019re mad at her about (or at least partially) usually people cheat because of something wrong in the relationship.  Maybe your dad wasn\u2019t very loving?  Maybe she felt trapped?  Etc etc.  usually there are two sides to cheating and  it\u2019s likely not just a moral failing of your mom.  Think about if you\u2019re being fair or hanging on to hurt from your childhood.", "He already did marry her, neither the mom or the sister were at it.", "I was thinking that he should wonder if his wife would take the baby to meet his mother.", "OP states that his mother had multiple affair partners throughout the years, and that she often disregarded her own children in favor of her affairs\u2026 so yeah, I think OP is a pretty good authority on knowing whether or not she should be anywhere near his child. \n\n\nAlso- \n> Do you even know what led to the affair?\n\nYou\u2019re joking\u2026 right?"]}
