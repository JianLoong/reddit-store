Just because you have a child doesn\u2019t mean you need a relationship with your mother. Your wife really needs to listen to what your mother did again. She blew her marriage up with multiple affairs, she lies and manipulated people to hide her affairs. Then she tried to get you as a child to also lie and manipulate your father. This is not a person you need in your life. Edit to add: you may need some marriage counseling if she won\u2019t back off and support your decision. This could ruin your marriage.

It's not something people in mostly healthy family dynamics understand. Because in those mostly healthy families there hasn't happened anything bad enough that anyone might think no contact is the best and healthiest solution. It doesn't fit into their world view that a mother can do anything bad enough to warrant a child freeze her out and doing that for eternity.\n\n\n\nSo, the questions in their minds are, will you take their grandchildren from them if they give him too much sugar or not enough toys? The wrong book? A dinosaur sweater instead of a truck? Will they be able to criticize some of your parenting choices or be able to be grandparents and spoil the heck out of the grandkids without you taking that as a reason to keep the kids away? And will their daughter support you? Their boundary pushing is so minuscule compared to what your mother did but it's the only things they can think of because they can't even fathom worse things happening.\n\n\nThey've thought themselves into the corner and they're lashing out before you can freeze them out. They're scared for themselves.\n\n\nSo, if they're otherwise nice enough people, sit them down and talk to them. Tell them that you're so happy that your kids will have awesome grandparents in them and that it's such a relief for you to see them model healthy families for your kids.
